https://openalex.org/W3177828909,"Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm."

Despite previous studies on the species, its genetic and evolutionary history deserves further research. Here, we present a haplotype-resolved assembly of an Oolong tea cultivar, Tieguanyin. Analysis of allele-specific expression suggests a potential mechanism in response to mutation load during long-term clonal propagation. Population genomic analysis using 190 Camellia accessions uncovered independent evolutionary histories and parallel domestication in two widely cultivated varieties, var. sinensis and var. assamica . It also revealed extensive intra- and interspecific introgressions contributing to genetic diversity in modern cultivars. Strong signatures of selection were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic pathways that contribute to flavor characteristics as well as genes likely involved in the Green Revolution in the tea industry. Our results offer genetic and molecular insights into the evolutionary history of Camellia sinensis and provide genomic resources to further facilitate gene editing to enhance desirable traits in tea crops."
https://openalex.org/W3182482959,"The aims of our study are firstly to investigate the diagnostic and triage performance of symptom checkers, secondly to assess their potential impact on healthcare utilisation and thirdly to investigate for variation in performance between systems.Publicly available symptom checkers for patient use.Publicly available symptom-checkers were identified. A standardised set of 50 clinical vignettes were developed and systematically run through each system by a non-clinical researcher.System accuracy was assessed by measuring the percentage of times the correct diagnosis was a) listed first, b) within the top five diagnoses listed and c) listed at all. The safety of the disposition advice was assessed by comparing it with national guidelines for each vignette.Twelve tools were identified and included. Mean diagnostic accuracy of the systems was poor, with the correct diagnosis being present in the top five diagnoses on 51.0% (Range 22.2 to 84.0%). Safety of disposition advice decreased with condition urgency (being 71.8% for emergency cases vs 87.3% for non-urgent cases). 51.0% of systems suggested additional resource utilisation above that recommended by national guidelines (range 18.0% to 61.2%). Both diagnostic accuracy and appropriate resource recommendation varied substantially between systems.There is wide variation in performance between available symptom checkers and overall performance is significantly below what would be accepted in any other medical field, though some do achieve a good level of accuracy and safety of disposition. External validation and regulation are urgently required to ensure these public facing tools are safe."
https://openalex.org/W3176494753,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants that escape convalescent and vaccine-induced antibody responses has renewed focus on the development of broadly protective T-cell-based vaccines. Here, we apply structure-based network analysis and assessments of HLA class I peptide stability to define mutationally constrained CD8+ T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Highly networked residues are conserved temporally among circulating variants and sarbecoviruses and disproportionately impair spike pseudotyped lentivirus infectivity when mutated. Evaluation of HLA class I stabilizing activity for 18 globally prevalent alleles identifies CD8+ T cell epitopes within highly networked regions with limited mutational frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and deep-sequenced primary isolates. Moreover, these epitopes elicit demonstrable CD8+ T cell reactivity in convalescent individuals but reduced recognition in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. These data thereby elucidate key mutationally constrained regions and immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for a global T-cell-based vaccine against emerging variants and SARS-like coronaviruses."
https://openalex.org/W3180104741,"The basal ganglia are known to influence action selection and modulation of movement vigor, but whether and how they contribute to specifying the kinematics of learned motor skills is not understood. Here, we probe this question by recording and manipulating basal ganglia activity in rats trained to generate complex task-specific movement patterns with rich kinematic structure. We find that the sensorimotor arm of the basal ganglia circuit is crucial for generating the detailed movement patterns underlying the acquired motor skills. Furthermore, the neural representations in the striatum, and the control function they subserve, do not depend on inputs from the motor cortex. Taken together, these results extend our understanding of the basal ganglia by showing that they can specify and control the fine-grained details of learned motor skills through their interactions with lower-level motor circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3179237162,"In mammalian embryos, proper zygotic genome activation (ZGA) underlies totipotent development. Double homeobox (DUX)-family factors participate in ZGA, and mouse Dux is required for forming cultured two-cell (2C)-like cells. Remarkably, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dux is activated by the tumor suppressor p53, and Dux expression promotes differentiation into expanded-fate cell types. Long-read sequencing and assembly of the mouse Dux locus reveals its complex chromatin regulation including putative positive and negative feedback loops. We show that the p53-DUX/DUX4 regulatory axis is conserved in humans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cells derived from patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) activate human DUX4 during p53 signaling via a p53-binding site in a primate-specific subtelomeric long terminal repeat (LTR)10C element. In summary, our work shows that p53 activation convergently evolved to couple p53 to Dux/DUX4 activation in embryonic stem cells, embryos and cells from patients with FSHD, potentially uniting the developmental and disease regulation of DUX-family factors and identifying evidence-based therapeutic opportunities for FSHD."
https://openalex.org/W3180476719,"Of the 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded by SARS CoV-2, Nsp3 is the largest and plays important roles in the viral life cycle. Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease domain (PLpro) that cleaves not only the viral polypeptide but also K48-linked polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier, ISG15, from host cell proteins. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme. Our work highlights the importance of studying Nsp3 and provides tools and valuable insights to investigate Nsp3 biology during the viral infection cycle."

Here, we used human single-neuron recordings during virtual spatial navigation tasks to identify neurons providing a neural code for egocentric spatial maps in the human brain. Consistent with previous observations in rodents, these neurons represented egocentric bearings toward reference points positioned throughout the environment. Egocentric bearing cells were abundant in the parahippocampal cortex and supported vectorial representations of egocentric space by also encoding distances toward reference points. Beyond navigation, the observed neurons showed activity increases during spatial and episodic memory recall, suggesting that egocentric bearing cells are not only relevant for navigation but also play a role in human memory. Spatial navigation and memory rely on neural systems that encode places, distances, and directions in relation to the external world or relative to the navigating organism.

Beyond navigation, the observed neurons showed activity increases during spatial and episodic memory recall, suggesting that egocentric bearing cells are not only relevant for navigation but also play a role in human memory. Humans and animals navigate and orient themselves by representing information about places, distances, and directions in allocentric reference frames, which are bound to the external world, or in egocentric reference frames, which are centered on the navigating subject (Figure S1) (Ekstrom et al., 2018Ekstrom A. Spiers H. Bohbot V. Rosenbaum R. Human spatial navigation. Princeton University Press, 2018Crossref Google Scholar). Behavioral studies have disentangled the importance of both allocentric and egocentric spatial representations, which complement each other to support efficient spatial behavior in everyday life (Burgess, 2006Burgess N. Spatial memory: how egocentric and allocentric combine.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10: 551-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Over the past decades, the neuroscience of spatial navigation has led to a detailed understanding of allocentric neural representations of space (Moser et al., 2017Moser E.I. Moser M.B. McNaughton B.L. Spatial representation in the hippocampal formation: a history.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1448-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For example, a place or grid cell may indicate if a subject is in the “northeast” corner of an environment (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2395) Google Scholar; O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971O’Keefe J. Dostrovsky J.

Neurosci. 1990; 10: 420-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a boundary vector/border cell may respond when a boundary is located to the “west” (Lever et al., 2009Lever C. Burton S. Jeewajee A.

These single-neuron codes provide the navigating organism with a “cognitive map” that encodes the environment’s structure as well as the subject’s location and orientation in allocentric coordinates (Tolman, 1948Tolman E.C. Cognitive maps in rats and men.Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). However, humans and animals experience environments primarily from a first-person perspective, they often remember locations and directions from egocentric viewpoints, and their planning and navigation along routes ultimately requires the paths to be represented in egocentric coordinates. Studies in non-human animals have recently begun to unravel the neural foundations of mental maps that could support such functions by identifying cells that activate at egocentric directions and distances from spatial boundaries (Alexander et al., 2020Alexander A.S.

Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and reference points scattered throughout the environment (Jercog et al., 2019Jercog P.E. Ahmadian Y. Woodruff C. Deb-Sen R. Abbott L.F. Kandel E.R. Heading direction with respect to a reference point modulates place-cell activity.Nat.

Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In humans, the single-neuron basis of egocentric spatial representations has remained poorly understood, however. We addressed this gap and hypothesized that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) track the instantaneous egocentric relationship between the navigating subject and proximal areas of the environment. Specifically, we tested for human neurons, ""egocentric bearing cells"" (EBCs), whose activity encodes the subject’s egocentric direction (and distance) toward local reference points, building on prior animal studies (Jercog et al., 2019Jercog P.E. Ahmadian Y. Woodruff C. Deb-Sen R. Abbott L.F. Kandel E.R. Heading direction with respect to a reference point modulates place-cell activity.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; LaChance et al., 2019LaChance P.A. Todd T.P. Taube J.S. A sense of space in postrhinal cortex.Science. 2019; 365: eaax4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Sarel et al., 2017Sarel A. Finkelstein A. Las L. Ulanovsky N. Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats.Science. 2017; 355: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2018Wang C. Chen X. Lee H. Deshmukh S.S. Yoganarasimha D. Savelli F. Knierim J.J. Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such a coding scheme is instrumental for egocentric navigation because it represents the proximal spatial layout relative to a person’s viewpoint, which provides self-centered orientation and allows route planning from a first-person perspective. Beyond spatial navigation, identifying the neural basis for egocentric cognitive maps also allows for a mechanistic understanding of different types of memory that preserve a subject’s original first-person perspective. We thus tested whether the activity of EBCs supported the processing of spatial information during spatial and episodic memory recall. In this way, our study links the phenomenological description of episodic memories as re-experiences of past personal events from egocentric viewpoints (Conway, 2009Conway M.A. Episodic memories.Neuropsychologia. 2009; 47: 2305-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar; Gardiner, 2001Gardiner J.M.

Sci. 2001; 356: 1351-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar; Tulving, 1972Tulving E. Episodic and semantic memory.in: Organization of Memory. Academic Press, 1972Google Scholar) with the hypothesis that egocentric neural representations of space contribute to the neural substrate of episodic memories (Buzsáki and Moser, 2013Buzsáki G. Moser E.I. Memory, navigation and theta rhythm in the hippocampal-entorhinal system.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2020Wang C. Chen X. Knierim J.J. Egocentric and allocentric representations of space in the rodent brain.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2020; 60: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overall, our study thus contributes to understanding the neural circuits underlying the first-person perspective in navigation and memory. In study 1, we recorded single-neuron activity from the MTL of 14 epilepsy patients (STAR Methods; Table S1) while they navigated a virtual environment to perform a spatial reference memory task (Kunz et al., 2015Kunz L. Schröder T.N. Lee H. Montag C. Lachmann B. Sariyska R. Reuter M. Stirnberg R. Stöcker T. Messing-Floeter P.C. et al.Reduced grid-cell-like representations in adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.Science. 2015; 350: 430-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Kunz et al., 2019Kunz L.

Adv. 2019; 5: eaav8192Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B ). In this task, patients first learned the spatial locations of eight different objects during an initial learning period. Afterward, in each of a series of test trials, patients were cued with one of the eight objects, tried to remember the object’s associated location, navigated to the remembered location, and pressed a button to mark their response. The patients then received feedback and collected the object from its correct location to re-encode the object-location association. Object locations remained stable throughout each session, which contrasts with study 2’s hybrid spatial navigation-episodic memory task where the subjects learned unique object-location associations on each trial. Throughout the task, we logged the patients’ virtual heading directions and locations to compare them with the simultaneously recorded neuronal activity. Patients contributed a total of 18 sessions (34–167 trials/session; 22–74 min/session) and performed the task well, as spatial memory performance was above chance on 83% of trials (Figure 1C) and increased over the course of the session (t test, t(17) = 3.051, p = 0.007; Figure 1D). Across all sessions, we recorded from a total of 729 neurons across multiple regions (Figures S2 and S3), including amygdala (242), entorhinal cortex (114), fusiform gyrus (25), hippocampus (146), parahippocampal cortex (65), temporal pole (128), and visual cortex (9). To identify potential human EBCs, we analyzed each neuron’s firing rate as a function of the patient’s egocentric bearing toward local reference points in the virtual environment (Figures 1E and S4) (Jercog et al., 2019Jercog P.E. Ahmadian Y. Woodruff C. Deb-Sen R. Abbott L.F. Kandel E.R. Heading direction with respect to a reference point modulates place-cell activity.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; LaChance et al., 2019LaChance P.A. Todd T.P. Taube J.S. A sense of space in postrhinal cortex.Science. 2019; 365: eaax4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Sarel et al., 2017Sarel A. Finkelstein A. Las L. Ulanovsky N. Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats.Science. 2017; 355: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2018Wang C. Chen X. Lee H. Deshmukh S.S. Yoganarasimha D. Savelli F. Knierim J.J. Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each cell, we iterated through a grid of candidate reference points (Figure 1F), each time assessing the degree to which the cell’s firing rate throughout navigation varied as a function of the subject’s egocentric bearing toward a given candidate reference point (comparing against surrogate statistics to test for significance). We then identified contiguous clusters of candidate reference points with significant egocentric tuning and measured each cluster’s overall statistical significance using cluster-based permutation testing (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007Maris E. Oostenveld R. Nonparametric statistical testing of EEG- and MEG-data.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 164: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (4339) Google Scholar). The center of mass of the largest significant cluster of significant candidate reference points (reference field) defined the reference point (Figure 1G). Our analysis thus resulted in the identification of individual neurons that behaved as EBCs by changing their firing rate to track the subject’s egocentric bearing toward a reference point in the virtual environment (Figure 2; Table S2). For example, the EBC in Figure 2A had its reference point in the “northeast” part of the environment (Figure 2A, left), and the cell’s firing rate increased when this reference point was ~45° to the right of the subject’s current heading (Figure 2A, middle). We further illustrate this cell’s tuning toward its reference point with a vector-field map (Figure 2A, right), showing the cell’s preferred allocentric direction as a function of location (Jercog et al., 2019Jercog P.E. Ahmadian Y. Woodruff C. Deb-Sen R. Abbott L.F. Kandel E.R. Heading direction with respect to a reference point modulates place-cell activity.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2018Wang C. Chen X. Lee H. Deshmukh S.S. Yoganarasimha D. Savelli F. Knierim J.J. Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In total, we observed 90 EBCs, 12% of all neurons, which is significantly more than expected by chance (binomial test versus 5% chance, p < 0.001). On average, there were 5.0 ± 1.2 (mean ± SEM) EBCs per recording session. We found at least one EBC in 16 of 18 sessions and in 12 of 14 patients. Some EBCs showed additional firing-rate modulations related to the patients’ allocentric direction and/or location (Figures 3A, S5, and S6), but a significant number of “pure” EBCs remained after excluding those EBCs that were also significantly tuned to allocentric direction and/or place (n = 59; 8%; binomial test, p < 0.001). EBCs were most prevalent in the parahippocampal cortex, where they comprised 28% of all neurons (Figure 3B). This result supports the idea that the functional role of the parahippocampal cortex includes the egocentric representation of space (Weniger and Irle, 2006Weniger G. Irle E. Posterior parahippocampal gyrus lesions in the human impair egocentric learning in a virtual environment.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 2406-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For EBCs, the computed vector-field maps (e.g., Figure 2A, right) often showed a systematic change in the cell’s preferred allocentric direction across different locations of the environment, which contrasts with the activity of neurons that code for allocentric directions (“direction cells”), because those cells’ vector-field maps consistently represent the same preferred allocentric direction across different locations. For example, one such direction cell activated when a subject was moving west, irrespective of its current location (Figure S5A). There were 78 direction cells in our dataset (11% of all neurons; binomial test, p < 0.001; Figure S5B), which as a group showed a broad range of preferred allocentric directions, which were not reliably clustered (Rayleigh test, z = 1.705, p = 0.182). To illustrate the different coding schemes of EBCs versus direction cells, we quantified the homogeneity of their vector-field maps and found that direction cells exhibited more similar directional tuning across the environment than EBCs (t test, t(166) = 6.913, p < 0.001; Figure S5C). Across the population of EBCs, reference points were positioned in many different locations of the environment, including both the center and the periphery (Figure 3C). Reference points observed in the same session were not closer to each other than expected by chance (permutation test, p = 0.812; Figure S7), suggesting that reference points were similarly broadly distributed across the environment in each experimental session. Overall, the spatial distribution of reference points overrepresented the environment center; the number of reference points in the central regions of the environment was higher than expected from a uniform distribution of reference points across the environment (binomial tests versus chance for the three innermost bins, all p < 0.001, Bonferroni corrected; Figure 3D). A similar overrepresentation of the environment center has been observed in rodents (LaChance et al., 2019LaChance P.A. Todd T.P. Taube J.S. A sense of space in postrhinal cortex.Science. 2019; 365: eaax4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2018Wang C. Chen X. Lee H. Deshmukh S.S. Yoganarasimha D. Savelli F. Knierim J.J. Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), supporting the general notion that the center of an environment has a special role in navigation (Gallistel, 1990Gallistel C.R. The Organization of Learning. MIT Press, 1990Google Scholar). An EBC’s preferred egocentric bearing depended on the position of its reference point; EBCs with reference points in the center of the environment showed a bimodal distribution of preferred egocentric bearings and tended to represent “ahead” and “behind” bearings (Rayleigh test for 2-fold symmetry, z = 14.215, p < 0.001; Figure 3E). In contrast, EBCs with reference points in the periphery showed a roughly uniform distribution of preferred egocentric bearings (Figure 3E). We next examined whether EBCs supported full vectorial representations of egocentric space by representing not only egocentric bearing but also egocentric distance to the reference points. We first tested whether the firing rates of EBCs correlated positively or negatively with the subject’s distance to the reference point (LaChance et al., 2019LaChance P.A. Todd T.P. Taube J.S. A sense of space in postrhinal cortex.Science. 2019; 365: eaax4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 10 of the 90 EBCs showed such a linear relationship between firing rate and distance to the reference point, which is significantly more than expected by chance (binomial test, p = 0.015). Among these 10 cells, we observed examples of both neurons that significantly increased their firing rates when the subject was farther away from the reference point (n = 6) and neurons that significantly increased their firing rates when the subject was closer to the reference point (n = 4) (Figures 3F and 3G). In a complementary analysis, we computed 2D firing-rate maps that showed the tuning of each EBC’s firing rate as a function of both egocentric bearing and distance to the reference point (Wang et al., 2018Wang C. Chen X. Lee H. Deshmukh S.S. Yoganarasimha D. Savelli F. Knierim J.J. Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In these firing-rate maps, we then identified “bearing-distance fields” as circumscribed areas of elevated firing. A substantial number of EBCs (n = 32) exhibited significant bearing-distance fields, in which their firing rates represented bearing and distance to the reference point conjunctively (Figures 3H–3K). For example, Figure 3J shows the activity of an EBC that responded when the reference point was ahead of the subject and at a distance of ~4,000 virtual units (vu). Across all EBCs, bearing-distance fields covered large parts of the 2D bearing-distance map (Figure 3L), with a greater representation of “ahead” and “behind” bearings and reference-point distances of ~3,000 vu. These results show that EBCs support full vectorial representations of egocentric space both via linear distance tuning and conjunctive bearing-distance fields. The combined representation of egocentric bearing and distance may be useful for navigation and orientation, because it allows the subject to compute not only the direction to the reference point but also its exact location. To address the question of whether EBCs were involved in spatial memory, we tested whether EBCs showed firing-rate changes related to spatial memory performance. To this end, we identified neurons whose firing rates correlated with ongoing spatial memory performance (“memory cells”), inspired by the observation that neurons in the monkey hippocampal formation change their firing with learning (Wirth et al., 2003Wirth S. Yanike M. Frank L.M. Smith A.C. Brown E.N. Suzuki W.A. Single neurons in the monkey hippocampus and learning of new associations.Science. 2003; 300: 1578-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Memory cells were particularly prevalent in the parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala (Figure 3M) and comprised both positive memory cells, whose firing rates increased with better spatial memory performance, and negative memory cells, which showed the opposite pattern. A significant number of EBCs fulfilled the criterion for being a memory cell (17 of 90 [19%]; binomial test, p < 0.001), including both positive (n = 8) and negative memory by EBCs (n = 9; Figure 3N). The percentage of memory cells was higher among EBCs than among non-spatial cells (40 of 523 [8%]; χ2 test, χ2(1) = 11.504, p < 0.001; Figure 3O), indicating that EBCs exhibited closer links between their firing rates and spatial memory performance than non-spatial cells. Notably, not only EBCs but also direction and place-like cells showed significantly increased percentages of memory cells as compared to non-spatial cells (direction cells: 14 of 78 [18%]; χ2 test versus non-spatial cells, χ2(1) = 8.807, p = 0.003; place-like cells: 14 of 85 [16%]; χ2 test versus non-spatial cells, χ2(1) = 7.032, p = 0.008), suggesting a general link between the activity of spatial cells in the human MTL and spatial memory performance. Spatial environments are often populated with objects. These objects can serve as beacons to guide navigation (Chan et al., 2012Chan E. Baumann O. Bellgrove M.A. Mattingley J.B. From objects to landmarks: the function of visual location information in spatial navigation.Front. Psychol. 2012; 3: 304Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), their arrangement may define the geometry of the spatial layout (Ekstrom and Isham, 2017Ekstrom A.D. Isham E.A. Human spatial navigation: Representations across dimensions and scales.Curr. Opin. Behav. Sci. 2017; 17: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and their presence can result in a distortion of allocentric cognitive maps (Boccara et al., 2019Boccara C.N. Nardin M. Stella F. O’Neill J. Csicsvari J. The entorhinal cognitive map is attracted to goals.Science. 2019; 363: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We thus tested for a relationship between EBCs and neurons coding for such objects and examined whether reference points were biased toward object locations. We first identified “object cells,” which changed their firing according to the identity of the objects whose locations the subject was learning and retrieving. For example, Figure 4A shows the activity of an object cell that increased its activity during trials with object 4. Object cells mainly represented non-spatial information about the objects, because—when examining object cells that responded to more than one object (n = 44)—the locations of the preferred objects were not clustered in space (permutation test, p = 0.406; Figure 4B). We observed 123 object cells overall (17% of all neurons; binomial test, p < 0.001; Figure 4C) and found that characteristics of object cells were also common among the identified EBCs (22 object cells among 90 EBCs; binomial test, p < 0.001; Figure 4D). Following theoretical models (Bicanski and Burgess, 2018Bicanski A. Burgess N. A neural-level model of spatial memory and imagery.eLife. 2018; 7: e33752Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), these conjunctive object by EBCs may constitute a neural interface between spatial and non-spatial task features and may thus provide a neural substrate for pattern completion during memory recall (see below). We then examined whether reference points of EBCs were biased toward object locations. Based on the finding of cells that are egocentrically tuned toward spatial goals or objects (Sarel et al., 2017Sarel A. Finkelstein A. Las L. Ulanovsky N. Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats.Science. 2017; 355: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; Wang et al., 2018Wang C. Chen X. Lee H. Deshmukh S.S. Yoganarasimha D. Savelli F. Knierim J.J. Egocentric coding of external items in the lateral entorhinal cortex.Science. 2018; 362: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and in view of the possibility that a single environmental cue could determine the location of a reference point, we tested whether reference points were clustered near object locations (Figure 4E). Only 2 of the 90 reference points were significantly close to their nearest object location (binomial test, p = 0.943; Figure 4F). There was also no evidence for significant reference-point shifts toward object locations when we analyzed remembered instead of actual object locations (one significantly close reference point; binomial test, p = 0.990), which could have been the case if EBCs had used the remembered object locations as reference points (Poulter et al., 2021Poulter S. Lee S.A. Dachtler J. Wills T.J. Lever C. Vector trace cells in the subiculum of the hippocampal formation.Nat. Neurosci. 2021; 24: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further, the allocentric directions toward reference points were not biased toward any of the distal landmarks (χ2 test, χ2(3) = 1.469, p = 0.689). Together, these findings suggest that the locations of reference points were not set by a single environmental cue. Instead,"

https://openalex.org/W3180037503,"The medial temporal lobe (MTL) supports a constellation of memory-related behaviors. Its involvement in perceptual processing, however, has been subject to enduring debate. This debate centers on perirhinal cortex (PRC), an MTL structure at the apex of the ventral visual stream (VVS). Here we leverage a deep learning framework that approximates visual behaviors supported by the VVS (i.e., lacking PRC). We first apply this approach retroactively, modeling 30 published visual discrimination experiments: excluding non-diagnostic stimulus sets, there is a striking correspondence between VVS-modeled and PRC-lesioned behavior, while each is outperformed by PRC-intact participants. We corroborate and extend these results with a novel experiment, directly comparing PRC-intact human performance to electrophysiological recordings from the macaque VVS: PRC-intact participants outperform a linear readout of high-level visual cortex. By situating lesion, electrophysiological, and behavioral results within a shared computational framework, this work resolves decades of seemingly inconsistent findings surrounding PRC involvement in perception."
https://openalex.org/W3178731706,"Background Almost 200,000 deaths from COVID-19 were reported in Brazil in 2020. The case fatality rate of a new infectious disease can vary by different risk factors and over time. We analysed the trends and associated factors of COVID-19 case fatality rates in Brazilian public hospital admissions during the first wave of the pandemic. Methods A retrospective cohort of all COVID-19-related admissions between epidemiological weeks 10–40 in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) was delimited from available reimbursement records. Smoothing time series and survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the trends of hospital case fatality rates (CFR) and the probability of death according to factors such as sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, length of stay and ICU use. Results With 398,063 admissions and 86,452 (21.7%) deaths, the overall age-standardized hospital CFR trend decreased throughout the period, varying from 31.8% (95%CI: 31.2 to 32.5%) in week 10 to 18.2% (95%CI: 17.6 to 18.8%) in week 40. This decreasing trend was observed in all sex, age, ethnic groups, length of stay and ICU admissions. Consistently, later admission (from July to September) was an independent protective factor. Patients 80+ year old had a hazard ratio of 8.18 (95% CI: 7.51 to 8.91). Ethnicity, comorbidities, and ICU need were also associated with the death risk. Although also decreasing, the CFR was always around 40–50% in people who needed an ICU admission. Conclusions The overall hospital CFR of COVID-19 has decreased in Brazilian public hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. Nevertheless, during the entire period, the CFR was still very high, suggesting the need for improving COVID-19 hospital care in Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3181770910,"The amyloid cascade hypothesis, which proposes a prominent role for full-length amyloid β peptides in Alzheimer’s disease, is currently being questioned. In addition to full-length amyloid β peptide, several N-terminally truncated fragments of amyloid β peptide could well contribute to Alzheimer’s disease setting and/or progression. Among them, pyroGlu3–amyloid β peptide appears to be one of the main components of early anatomical lesions in Alzheimer’s disease–affected brains. Little is known about the proteolytic activities that could account for the N-terminal truncations of full-length amyloid β, but they appear as the rate-limiting enzymes yielding the Glu3–amyloid β peptide sequence that undergoes subsequent cyclization by glutaminyl cyclase, thereby yielding pyroGlu3–amyloid β. Here, we investigated the contribution of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 in Glu3–amyloid β peptide formation and the functional influence of its genetic depletion or pharmacological blockade on spine maturation as well as on pyroGlu3–amyloid β peptide and amyloid β 42–positive plaques and amyloid β 42 load in the triple transgenic Alzheimer’s disease mouse model. Furthermore, we examined whether reduction of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 could rescue learning and memory deficits displayed by these mice. Our data establish that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 reduction alleviates anatomical, biochemical, and behavioral Alzheimer’s disease–related defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 activity is increased early in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease brains. Thus, our data demonstrate that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 participates in pyroGlu3–amyloid β peptide formation and that targeting this peptidase could be considered as an alternative strategy to interfere with Alzheimer’s disease progression.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the main age-related neurodegenerative disease, the etiology of which remains a matter of questions. One of the main hypotheses referred to as the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” (1Hardy J.A. Higgins G.A. Alzheimer's disease: The amyloid cascade hypothesis.Science. 1992; 256: 184-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (4535) Google Scholar) postulates a key role of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide accumulation (2Checler F. Processing of the b-amyloid precursor protein and its regulation in Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) in various brain zones, including those controlling memory, a psychometric paradigm altered in AD and that worsens as the disease progresses. However, the consistent failure of Aβ-centric clinical trials aimed at reducing Aβ load by immunotherapy or pharmacological targeting of its generating enzyme γ-secretase (3Panza F. Lozupone M.

Shen J. Zhao H.L. Major clinical trials failed the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.J. Am. Geriatr.

It remains that, undoubtedly, genetic evidence brought a crystal-clear demonstration that amyloid precursor protein (APP)-linked fragments could participate in the pathology. Several APP-linked catabolites distinct from genuine full-length Aβ (flAβ) were shown to account for some of early lesions of AD-affected brains and could well contribute to the pathology (6Pulina M.V.

Particularly interesting is the pyroGlu3–Aβ (pE3-Aβ) fragment that derives from an N-terminal dipeptide truncation of Aβ yielding a Glu3-Aβ (E3-Aβ) peptide that is subsequently cyclized by glutaminyl cyclase (QC) (18Schilling S.

Numerous anatomical and biochemical evidences suggested that QC is involved in the conversion of E3-Aβ into pE3-Aβ, but the most straightforward demonstration of its key role was brought by studies showing that its pharmacological blockade or genetic depletion alleviates AD-like cognitive defects in an AD mouse model (20Jawhar S.

Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 4 (DPP4) is an exopeptidase that was formerly described, by fluorogenic dipeptides substrates screening, as an exopeptidase preferentially cleaving X-Pro sequence (21Rahfeld J. Schutkowski M. Faust J. Neubert K. Barth A. Heins J. Extended investigation of the substrate specificity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV from pig kidney.Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1991; 372: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and hence, was first referred to as a post–proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (22Checler F. Neuropeptide-degrading peptidases.in: Nagatsu T. Parvez H. Naoi M. Parvez S. Methods in Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides Research. Part 2. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1993: 375-418Google Scholar). However, it appeared that most of its main natural substrates harbor an N-terminal dipeptide X-Ala. Strikingly, this structural motif corresponds to the N-terminal sequence (Asp-Ala) of the Aβ peptide. Therefore, DPP4 appears as a good enzyme candidate responsible for the rate-limiting removal of this dipeptide. Indeed, few studies showed that DPP4 could, in concert with QC, yield pE3-40/42Aβ, in vitro (23Antonyan A. Schlenzig D. Schilling S. Naumann M. Sharoyan S. Mardanyan S. Demuth H.U.

DPP-4 inhibitors: A promising therapeutic approach against Alzheimer's disease.Ann. Transl. Med. 2018; 6: 255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cheng Q. Cheng J. Cordato D. Gao J. Can dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors treat cognitive disorders?.Pharmacol. Ther. 2020; 212: 107559Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Here, we show by MS that human recombinant DPP4 releases the N-terminal dipeptide of synthetic Aβ40 and in agreement, that a DPP4 specific inhibitor potentiates the recovery of flAβ generated by APP-expressing human cells. We show that the pharmacological blockade of DPP4 by its specific inhibitor sitagliptin rescues dendrite morphological alterations in organotypic slices derived from mice infected with lentiviruses harboring the APP bearing the Swedish mutation (APPswe) sequence. Furthermore, both sitagliptin and shRNA directed toward DPP4 reduce the number of Aβ42-positive plaques and Aβ40/42 loads in triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mouse brain. We also establish that DPP4 genetic reduction and/or sitagliptin alleviate cognitive defects assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) and Barnes maze tests in 3xTg-AD mice. Finally, we document a Braak stage–dependent and transient augmentation of DPP4 activity in a cohort of sporadic AD brains. Altogether, our data bring novel insights supporting the possibility that DPP4 could contribute to AD pathology. By using antibodies that interact only with the free N-terminal aspartyl residue of Aβ (FCA18, (26Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C. Marambaud P. Ancolio K.

Furthermore, we assessed the potential effect of the aminopeptidase M (PL250) (29Chen H. Roques B.P. Fournie-Zaluski M.C.

PL302 and P32/98 but not PL250 significantly potentiated the recovery of flAβ (Fig. 1). Interestingly, we observed an additive effect of PL302 and P32/98 (Fig. 1). These data indicate that APA and DPP4 but not aminopeptidase M contribute to the N-terminal truncation of flAβ and that these catalytic events are likely independent. We analyzed the capability of human recombinant DPP4 (rDPP4) to generate Aβ3-40 from synthetic Aβ40. By MS analysis, we found that DPP4 converts Aβ1-40 synthetic peptide into Aβ3-40, thus releasing the N-terminal dipeptide of Aβ40 (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, the Aβ3-40/Aβ1-40 ratio increased with time and was prevented by the DPP4-specific inhibitor p32/98 (31Pospisilik J.A. Stafford S.G. Demuth H.U. Brownsey R. Parkhouse W. Finegood D.T.

We have evaluated the putative impact of DPP4 on spine morphology of hippocampal organotypic slices infected with lentiviruses expressing green, WT APP, or APPswe-green constructs (see expressions in Fig. 3B, upper panels). The spine morphology (Fig. 3B, lower panels) was classified within three categories: mature (mushroom/thin, Fig. 3C, red bars), stubby (Fig. 3C, yellow bars), and immature spines (filopodia, Fig. 3C, green bars). First, of note, the expression of the various constructs did not affect neuronal viability as assessed by NeuN expression (Fig. S1). APPswe-expressing slices show a lower number of mature spines than WT APP (APPwt) and green, and a concomitant increase of dendritic filopodia (compare APPwt NT and APPswe NT conditions in Fig. 3C). Of importance, the morphological alterations observed in APPswe-expressing slices were fully rescued by pretreatment with the highly potent and selective DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin (32Green B.D. Flatt P.R. Bailey C.J. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) inhibitors: A newly emerging drug class for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.Diab. Vasc. Dis. Res. 2006; 3: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), (Fig. 3, B and C, compare APPswe NT versus Sita). This suggested the possibility that DPP4-mediated sitagliptin-sensitive production of pE3-Aβ could account for the alteration of dendritic spines in these organotypic slices. To support this view, we checked whether organotypic slices harbor functional DPP4 and if they produce pE3-Aβ. Our data show that indeed, organotypic slices express pE3-Aβ-like in situ immunoreactivity (Fig. S2A) that is present in insoluble fractions prepared from these slices (Fig. S2B) and display sitagliptin-sensitive DPP4-hydrolyzing activity (Fig. S2C). It is of importance to note that our recent study indicated that synthetic pE3-Aβ could indeed alter dendritic morphology and mimic that triggered by APPswe expression (33Valverde A. Dunys J. Lorivel T. Debayle D. Gay A.S. Lacas-Gervais S. Roques B.P. Chami M. Checler F. Aminopeptidase A contributes to biochemical, anatomical and cognitive defects in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and is increased at early stage in sporadic AD brain.Acta Neuropathol. 2021; 141: 823-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Overall, this set of data indicates that DPP4 contributes to the morphological alterations affecting spines in an ex vivo AD model. We attempted to reduce DPP4 expression and activity by shRNA approach. We designed several shRNA probes targeting DPP4 (shDPP4) as well as an shRNA corresponding to a control scramble sequence (shScr). We first examined their ability to lower DPP4 expression and activity in N2a cells. Among them, one sequence (see Experimental procedures) was selected because its transfection reduced the number of DPP4-positive N2a cells by about 30% when compared with shScr (Fig. S3, A and B). Then, we produced lentiviruses harboring the shScr and shDPP4 sequences coupled with GFP. This allowed to confirm that stereotaxical delivery of shRNAs adequately yielded GFP expression in the subiculum of the hippocampus of mouse brains (Fig. S3C). shDPP4 infection triggers an about 25% reduction of DPP4 activity in WT mouse brain (Fig. S3, D and E). We have examined the biochemical and anatomical impacts of DPP4 gene reduction in 3xTg-AD mice infected or not at the age of 3 months with the above-selected shDPP4- or shScr-expressing lentiviruses. At the age of 12 months, DPP4 downregulation drastically reduces the number of Aβ42-positive plaques (Fig. 4, A and B) without affecting their mean perimeter (Fig. 4C) and areas (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, we also observed a decreased expression of pE3-Aβ in 3xTg-AD mice infected with shDPP4 (Fig. S4). Accordingly, as expected at this age, both Aβ40 and Aβ42 recoveries were much higher in the insoluble fraction (which mostly contains Aβ in an aggregated state) prepared from shScr-3xTg-AD than in shScr-WT infected mice (Fig. 4, E and F). However, both Aβ species were drastically lowered in these insoluble fractions upon shDPP4 infection (Fig. 4, E and F). We attempted to examine the influence of chronic treatment with sitagliptin. At first, we aimed at assessing whether intraperitoneal administration of sitagliptin could significantly inhibit cerebral DPP4. Indeed, we show that an 8-day treatment of 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice triggers a reduction of about 30% of cerebral DPP4 activity (Fig. S5). Of note, the extent of sitagliptin-mediated inhibition of central DPP4 was similar to the one achieved by shDPP4 (Fig. S3, D and E). Although partial, this inhibition could however reflect full blockade of DPP4. Thus, we previously established that Gly-Pro–7-amido-4-methylcoumarin undergoes DPP4-unrelated cleavages in crude tissues (34Dauch P. Masuo Y. Vincent J.P. Checler F. A survey of the cerebral regionalization and ontogeny of eight exo- and endo- peptidases in murines.Peptides. 1993; 14: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that could account for shDPP4 and sitagliptin-resistant hydrolyzing activity. This was performed at an earlier age, when Aβ42-positive plaques are clearly less numerous than at the age of 12 months. Thus, the quantification of the number of plaques was more difficult and suffers from higher randomness. Nevertheless, although it did not reach statistical significance, we observed a consistent reduction of Aβ42-positives plaques (Fig. 5, A and B), mean area (Fig. 5C) and perimeter (Fig. 5D). In agreement with a genuine reduction of plaques number, Aβ42 was recovered in a lower amount in the insoluble fraction prepared from sitagliptin-treated 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. 5F), while Aβ40 lowering did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5E). Overall, our combined genetic and pharmacological approaches indicate that DPP4 downregulation lowers Aβ-positive plaque formation and Aβ aggregation in 3xTg-AD mice. To determine whether DPP4 activity could modulate memory and learning in vivo, we used the 3xTg-AD mouse model that gathers several hallmarks of AD pathology, that are, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, memory deficit, and synaptic plasticity defects (35Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy G. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F. Triple-transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease with plaques and tangles: Intracellular Ab and synaptic dysfunction.Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). We used two well-known spatial learning tests, the MWM and Barnes maze, that are considered as sensitive means to detect memory deficits in these mice (36Stover K.R. Campbell M.A. Van Winssen C.M. Brown R.E. Early detection of cognitive deficits in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Behav. Brain Res. 2015; 289: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), to examine the influence of genetic and pharmacological reduction of DPP4 activity. As expected, 3xTg-AD mice were affected in their learning ability as reflected by a higher latency to reach the platform than WT mice in the MWM (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, shDPP4 partly rescues these alterations (Fig. 6A). This is further supported by the randomness in the trajectories of shScr-treated 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. 6B, left panel) that was corrected in shDPP4-treated mice in probe tests performed at 48 h where treated mice swim in the adequate north west zone virtually similar to WT mice (Fig. 6B, right panel). Of note, chronic treatment with sitagliptin indicated that pharmacological blockade of DPP4 also partly rescued the latency to reach the target zone in the Barnes test, a paradigm that was drastically altered in shScr-treated 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. S6A). Accordingly, sitagliptin partly improved the distribution of the number of entries in every hole in sitagliptin-treated 3xTg-AD mice (Fig. S6B). Of importance, neither sitagliptin nor shDPP4 (data not shown) affects locomotor activity or anxiety parameters as measured by the rotarod and open field test (Fig. S7). It has already been described that pE3-42Aβ is present in abundance in brains of patients with sporadic and familial AD (37Portelius E. Andreasson U. Ringman J.M. Buerger K. Daborg J. Buchhave P. Hansson O. Harmsen A. Gustavsson M.K. Hanse E. Galasko D. Hampel H. Blennow K. Zetterberg H. Distinct cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta peptide signatures in sporadic and PSEN1 A431E-associated familial Alzheimer's disease.Mol. Neurodegener. 2010; 5: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, according to our data, we assumed that there should be an enhanced activity of DPP4 in AD-affected brains. Here, we compared DPP4 activity in hippocampi of controls and patients suffering from sporadic AD at different Braak stages (Table S1). We observed a higher inhibitor-sensitive DPP4 activity in AD brains than in control patients. This increase appears to be AD Braak stage-dependent, culminated at stages I-III and then declined to return to control values at later stages (Fig. 7). The main conclusion of our study is that the reduction of DPP4 could be beneficial in the context of AD. It is supported by five lines of independent in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo evidence. First, recombinant DPP4 releases the N-terminal dipeptide of synthetic Aβ. Second, inhibition of DPP4 in human cells potentiates the recovery of secreted flAβ. Third, in APPswe-expressing neurons that display drastic alterations of dendritic spines morphology, pharmacological blockade of DPP4 fully restores a normal phenotype. Fourth, both genetic and pharmacological approaches drastically reduce Aβ42-positive plaques and Aβ40/42 load in insoluble fractions prepared from 3xTg-AD brains. Fifth, shDPP4 and sitagliptin partly rescue learning and memory deficits. Overall, this consistent network of evidence strongly suggests that DPP4 could contribute to the generation of E3-Aβ in AD. It should be noted that DPP4 was documented as the rate-limiting enzyme yielding E3-Aβ amenable to cyclization by QC. These concerted enzymatic events have been previously documented in vitro (23Antonyan A. Schlenzig D. Schilling S. Naumann M. Sharoyan S. Mardanyan S. Demuth H.U.

Int. 2018; 113: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). DPP4 inhibitors have been proposed as means to interfere with cognitive disorders (25Cheng Q. Cheng J. Cordato D. Gao J. Can dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors treat cognitive disorders?.Pharmacol. Ther. 2020; 212: 107559Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Most of studies deal with type 2 diabetes, a well-recognized risk factor for cognitive dysfunctions and dementia (38Yuan X.Y. Wang X.G. Mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus and related risk factors: A review.Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 28: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is mainly due to the propensity of DPP4 to hydrolyze many substrates (39Kosaraju J. Holsinger R.M.D. Guo L. Tam K.Y. Linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, mitigates cognitive deficits and pathology in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.Mol.

GLP-1 is a 30-amino acid peptide which harbors an His-Ala N-terminal dipeptide that fulfills the requirement of DPP4 specificity.

https://openalex.org/W3179535929,"The molecular mechanisms of olfaction, or the sense of smell, are relatively underexplored compared with other sensory systems, primarily because of its underlying molecular complexity and the limited availability of dedicated predictive computational tools. Odorant receptors (ORs) allow the detection and discrimination of a myriad of odorant molecules and therefore mediate the first step of the olfactory signaling cascade. To date, odorant (or agonist) information for the majority of these receptors is still unknown, limiting our understanding of their functional relevance in odor-induced behavioral responses. In this study, we introduce OdoriFy, a Web server featuring powerful deep neural network-based prediction engines. OdoriFy enables (1) identification of odorant molecules for wildtype or mutant human ORs (Odor Finder); (2) classification of user-provided chemicals as odorants/nonodorants (Odorant Predictor); (3) identification of responsive ORs for a query odorant (OR Finder); and (4) interaction validation using Odorant-OR Pair Analysis. In addition, OdoriFy provides the rationale behind every prediction it makes by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence. This module highlights the basis of the prediction of odorants/nonodorants at atomic resolution and for the ORs at amino acid levels. A key distinguishing feature of OdoriFy is that it is built on a comprehensive repertoire of manually curated information of human ORs with their known agonists and nonagonists, making it a highly interactive and resource-enriched Web server. Moreover, comparative analysis of OdoriFy predictions with an alternative structure-based ligand interaction method revealed comparable results. OdoriFy is available freely as a web service at https://odorify.ahujalab.iiitd.edu.in/olfy/."
https://openalex.org/W3177505682,"Animal models that recapitulate human diseases and disorders are widely used to investigate etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of those conditions in people. Disorders during pregnancy are particularly difficult to explore as interventions in pregnant women are not easily performed. Therefore, models that allow for pre-conception investigations are advantageous for elucidating the mechanisms involved in adverse pregnancy outcomes that are responsible for both maternal and fetal morbidity, such as preeclampsia. The Blood Pressure High (BPH)/5 mouse model has been used extensively to study the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. The female BPH/5 mouse is obese with increased adiposity and borderline hypertension, both of which are exacerbated with pregnancy making it a model of superimposed preeclampsia. Thus, the BPH/5 model shares traits with a large majority of women with pre-existing conditions that predisposes them to preeclampsia. We sought to explore the genome of the BPH/5 female mouse and determine the genetic underpinnings that may contribute to preeclampsia-associated phenotypes in this model. Using a whole genome sequencing approach, we are the first to characterize the genetic mutations in BPH/5 female mice that make it unique from the closely related BPH/2 model and the normotensive background strain, C57Bl/6. We found the BPH/5 female mouse to be uniquely different from BPH/2 and C57Bl/6 mice with a genetically complex landscape. The majority of non-synonymous consequences within the coding region of BPH/5 females were missense mutations found most abundant on chromosome X when comparing BPH/5 and BPH/2, and on chromosome 8 when comparing BPH/5 to C57Bl/6. Genetic mutations in BPH/5 females largely belong to immune system-related processes, with overlap between BPH/5 and BPH/2 models. Further studies examining each gene mutation during pregnancy are warranted to determine key contributors to the BPH/5 preeclamptic-like phenotype and to identify genetic similarities to women that develop preeclampsia."

Currently established methods like flow cytometry or qPCR lack the capability of enabling high throughput sample processing while they require a lot of manual handling. To address this limitation, we developed an immunological real-time imaging method to quantify the infectious titer of anti-CD19 CAR lentiviral vectors with a temporal readout using the Incucyte ® S3 live-cell analysis system. The infective titers determined with the Incucyte ® approach when compared with the flow cytometry-based assay had a lower standard deviation between replicates and a broader linear range. A major advantage of the method is the ability to obtain titer results in real-time, enabling an optimal readout time. The presented protocol significantly decreased labor and increased throughput. The ability of the assay to process high numbers of lentiviral samples in a high throughput manner was proven by performing a virus stability study, demonstrating the effects of temperature, salt, and shear stress on LV infectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3179150958,"The invasion and wide spread of Spodoptera frugiperda represent real impediments to food security and the livelihood of the millions of maize and sorghum farming communities in the sub-Saharan and Sahel regions of Africa. Current management efforts for the pest are focused on the use of synthetic pesticides, which are often economically unviable and are extremely hazardous to the environment. The use of biological control offers a more economically and environmentally safer alternative. In this study, the performance of the recently described parasitoid, Cotesia icipe, against the pest was elucidated. We assessed the host stage acceptability by and suitability for C. icipe, as well as its ovigenic status. Furthermore, the habitat suitability for the parasitoid in the present and future climatic conditions was established using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). Cotesia icipe differentially accepted the immature stages of the pest. The female acceptance of 1st and 2nd instar larvae for oviposition was significantly higher with more than 60% parasitism. No oviposition on the egg, 5th and 6th larval instars, and pupal stages was observed. Percentage of cocoons formed, and the number of emerged wasps also varied among the larval stages. At initial parasitism, parasitoid progenies, time to cocoon formation and overall developmental time were significantly affected by the larval stage. Egg-load varied significantly with wasp age, with six-day-old wasps having the highest number of mature eggs. Ovigeny index of C. icipe was 0.53. Based on the models, there is collinearity in the ecological niche of the parasitoid and the pest under current and future climate scenarios. Eastern, Central and parts of coastal areas of western Africa are highly suitable for the establishment of the parasitoid. The geographic distribution of the parasitoid would remain similar under future climatic conditions. In light of the findings of this study, we discuss the prospects for augmentative and classical biological control of S. frugiperda with C. icipe in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3178887335,"We examined the influence of using different epoch lengths on the classification accuracy of laboratory-controlled sedentary behaviour (SB), and free-living total time and time spent in bouts of SB and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), in children and adolescents. We used two studies including accelerometer-derived data of: 1) controlled activities, i.e. seven sedentary, one standing and one dancing (n = 90); 2) free-living activities (n = 902). For the controlled-activity data, we calculated percentages of time classified as SB and MVPA. For the free-living data, we calculated medians (25th-75th percentiles) of total time and time spent in bouts of SB and MVPA. Applying 8counts/5seconds, 25counts/15seconds and 100counts/60seconds for SB on controlled-activity data revealed respectively (1) 92-96%, 89-99% and 98-100% of sedentary time accurately classified as SB (activity- and age-dependent); (2) 91-98%, 88-99% and 97-100% of standing time classified as SB (age-dependent); (3) 25-37%, 20-25% and 25-38% of dancing time classified as SB (age-dependent). Using longer epochs, children's total time in SB and MVPA decreased while time accumulated in bouts of SB and MVPA accumulated in bouts increased. We conclude that a 60-second epoch seems preferable when the aim is to classify sedentary behaviour, while a shorter epoch length is needed to capture children's short bursts of MPVA. Furthermore, we should be aware that a longer epoch results in averaging of intensities to the middle category."

This retrospective study explored potential short-term postoperative benefits and unintended consequences of a multidisciplinary prehabilitation program regarding in-hospital complications.Data on patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery between January 2014 and April 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Pearson's chi-squared tests were used to compare patients who followed prehabilitation (three times per week, at a minimum of three weeks) during the waiting period with patients who received no prehabilitation. Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity-score matching, in which the propensity score was based on the baseline variables that affected the outcomes.Of 1201 patients referred for elective cardiac surgery, 880 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 91 followed prehabilitation (53.8% ≥ 65 years, 78.0% male, median Euroscore II 1.3, IQR, 0.9-2.7) and 789 received no prehabilitation (60.7% ≥ 65 years, 69.6% male, median Euroscore II 1.6, IQR, 1.0-2.8). The incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) was significantly lower in the prehabilitation group compared to the unmatched and matched standard care group (resp. 14.3% vs. 23.8%, P = 0.040 and 14.3% vs. 25.3%, P = 0.030). For the other complications, no between-group differences were found.Prehabilitation might be beneficial to prevent postoperative AF. Patients participated safely in prehabilitation and were not at higher risk for postoperative complications. However, well-powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm and deepen these results."
https://openalex.org/W3180257825,"Wetlands along upper estuaries are characterized by dynamic transitions between forested and herbaceous communities (marsh) as salinity, hydroperiod, and nutrients change. The importance of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) associated with fine and coarse root growth also changes but remains the dominant component of overall productivity in these important blue carbon wetlands. Appropriate BNPP assessment techniques to use in various tidal wetlands are not well-defined, and could make a difference in BNPP estimation. We hypothesized that different BNPP techniques applied among tidal wetlands differ in estimation of BNPP and possibly also correlate differently with porewater nutrient concentrations. We compare 6-month and 12-month root ingrowth, serial soil coring techniques utilizing two different calculations, and a mass balance approach (TBCA, Total Belowground Carbon Allocation) among four tidal wetland types along each of two river systems transitioning from freshwater forest to marsh. Median values of BNPP were 266 to 2946 g/m2/year among all techniques used, with lower BNPP estimation from root ingrowth cores and TBCA (266-416 g/m2/year), and higher BNPP estimation from serial coring of standing crop root biomass (using Smalley and Max-Min calculation methods) (2336-2946 g/m2/year). Root turnover (or longevity) to a soil depth of 30 cm was 2.2/year (1.3 years), 2.7/year (1.1 years), 4.5/year (0.9 years), and 1.2/year (2.6 years), respectively, for Upper Forest, Middle Forest, Lower Forest, and Marsh. Marsh had greater root biomass and BNPP, with slower root turnover (greater root longevity) versus forested wetlands. Soil porewater concentrations of NH3 and reactive phosphorus stimulated BNPP in the marsh when assessed with short-deployment BNPP techniques, indicating that pulses of mineralized nutrients may stimulate BNPP to facilitate marsh replacement of forested wetlands. Overall, ingrowth techniques appeared to represent forested wetland BNPP adequately, while serial coring may be necessary to represent herbaceous plant BNPP from rhizomes as marshes replace forested wetlands."

However, many aspects of the context-dependent expression of mt-tRNAs in mammals remain unknown. To investigate the tissue-specific effects of mt-tRNAs, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial tRNA expression across five mice tissues (brain, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney) using Northern blot analysis. Striking differences in the tissue-specific expression of 22 mt-tRNAs were observed, in some cases differing by as much as tenfold from lowest to highest expression levels among these five tissues. Overall, the heart exhibited the highest levels of mt-tRNAs, while the liver displayed markedly lower levels. Variations in the levels of mt-tRNAs showed significant correlations with total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contents in these tissues. However, there were no significant differences observed in the 2-thiouridylation levels of tRNALys, tRNAGlu, and tRNAGln among these tissues. A wide range of aminoacylation levels for 15 mt-tRNAs occurred among these five tissues, with skeletal muscle and kidneys most notably displaying the highest and lowest tRNA aminoacylation levels, respectively. Among these tissues, there was a negative correlation between variations in mt-tRNA aminoacylation levels and corresponding variations in mitochondrial tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRS) expression levels. Furthermore, the variable levels of OXPHOS subunits, as encoded by mtDNA or nuclear genes, may reflect differences in relative functional emphasis for mitochondria in each tissue. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of mt-tRNA tissue-specific effects on oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W3180755658,"Given that mobile phone usage has increased rapidly throughout the world, one possibility to increase parental involvement in monitoring their children's progression is to train parents or primary caregivers on the use of mobile phone technology to track their children's developmental milestones. The current paper aimed to describe the development of a mobile phone application for use among primary caregivers and establish the feasibility and preliminary impact of caregivers using a mobile phone application to track the progression of their children's development in a context where there is a paucity of similar studies. This study is a substudy that focusses on the intervention group only of a recently completed two-armed quasi-experimental study in an informal settlement in Nairobi. The mobile phone application which consisted of questions on children's developmental progression, as well as stimulation messages, was developed through a step-wise approach. The questions covered five child developmental domains: communication; fine motor; gross motor; personal-social; and, problem-solving. Depending on the response received, the child would be classified as having 'achieved a milestone' or 'milestone not achieved.' If a child had achieved the milestone for a specific age, a caregiver would receive an SMS on how to stimulate the child to achieve the next milestone. Where the milestone was not achieved, the caregiver would get a message to enhance development in the area of delay. Caregivers with children aged between six months and two years were recruited into the study and received questions and messages regarding their children's development (age-specific) on a monthly basis for 12 months. Caregiver adherence to the intervention was above 90% in the first three months of implementation. Thereafter, the response rate fluctuated between 76% and 86% across the subsequent months of the intervention. The high level and fairly stable caregivers' rate of response to the 12 rounds of messaging indicated feasibility of the mobile technology. Further, in the first three months of intervention implementation, the majority of caregivers were able to keep track of how their children attained their developmental milestones. The intervention seems to be scalable, practical and potentially low-cost because of the wide coverage of phones."
https://openalex.org/W3181543962,"In the penultimate step of the coagulation cascade, the multidomain vitamin-K-dependent zymogen prothrombin is converted to thrombin by the prothrombinase complex composed of factor Xa, cofactor Va, and phospholipids. Activation of prothrombin requires cleavage at two residues, R271 and R320, along two possible pathways generating either the intermediate prethrombin-2 (following initial cleavage at R271) or meizothrombin (following initial cleavage at R320). The former pathway is preferred in the absence of and the latter in the presence of cofactor Va. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this preference, but the role of the sequence and position of the sites of cleavage has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we engineered constructs where the sequences 261DEDSDRAIEGRTATSEYQT279 and 310RELLESYIDGRIVEGSDAE328 were swapped between the R271 and R320 sites. We found that in the absence of cofactor Va, the wild-type sequence at the R271 site is cleaved preferentially regardless of its position at the R271 or R320 site, whereas in the presence of cofactor Va, the R320 site is cleaved preferentially regardless of its sequence. Additional single-molecule FRET measurements revealed that the environment of R271 changes significantly upon cleavage at R320 due to the conformational transition from the closed form of prothrombin to the open form of meizothrombin. Detailed kinetics of cleavage at the R271 site were monitored by a newly developed assay based on loss of FRET. These findings show how sequence and position of the cleavage sites at R271 and R320 dictate the preferred pathway of prothrombin activation."

To understand the factors associated with dropping out of CBHI, we employ a multivariate logistic regression on a subsample of 251 households who were either currently enrolled or had enrolled at one time and later dropped out.Overall, we find that 25.1 percent of the households that had ever enrolled in insurance reported dropping out. Household socioeconomic status (wealth) was one of the key factors that associated with dropping out. Larger household sizes and distance from the hospital were significantly associated with dropping out. More socially connected households were less likely to drop out revealing the influence of community social capital in keeping households insured.The findings have implications for addressing equity and inclusion concerns in community-based health insurance programmes such as one in south-western Uganda. Even when community based informal system aim for inclusion of the poorest, they are not enough and often the poorest of the poor slip into the cracks and remain uninsured or drop out. Moreover, policy interventions toward curtailing high dropout rates should be considered to ensure financial sustainability of CBHI schemes."
https://openalex.org/W3178532724,"Objective To realize the regulation of the position of corn seed planting in precision farming, an intelligent monitoring system is designed for corn seeding based on machine vision and the Genetic Algorithm-optimized Back Propagation (GABP) algorithm. Methods Based on the research on precision positioning seeding technology, comprehensive application of sensors, Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers, and other technologies, combined with modern optimization algorithms, the online dynamic calibration controls of line spacing and plant spacing are implemented. Based on the machine vision and GABP algorithm, a test platform for the seeding effect detection system is designed to provide a reference for further precision seeding operations. GA can obtain better initial network weights and thresholds and find the optimal individual through selection, crossover, and mutation operations; that is, the optimal initial weight of the Back Propagation (BP) neural network. Field experiments verify the seeding performance of the precision corn planter and the accuracy of the seeding monitoring system. Results 1. The deviation between the average value of the six precision positioning seeding experiments of corn under the random disturbance signal and the ideal value of the distance is less than or equal to 0.5 cm; the deviation between the average value of the six precision positioning seeding experiments of corn under the sine wave disturbance signal (1 Hz) is less than or equal to 0.4 cm; the qualified rate of grain distance reaches 100%. 2. The precision control index, replay index, and missed index of the designed corn precision seeding intelligent control system have all reached the national standard. During the operation of the seeder, an alarm of the seeder leaking occurred, and the buzzer sounded and the screen displayed 100 times each; therefore, the reliability of the alarm system is 100%. Conclusion The intelligent corn seeder designed based on precision positioning seeding technology can reduce the seeding rate of the seeder and ensure the stability of the seed spacing effectively. Based on the machine vision and GABP algorithm, the seeding effect detection system can provide a reference for the further realization of precision seeding operations."
https://openalex.org/W3179381687,"Introduction Regulations of the sale of tobacco products to minors have been effective at reducing adolescent tobacco use overall. However, these efforts may not be uniformly enforced in all areas, creating uneven protection against adolescent smoking. Knowledge regarding factors associated with tobacco retail outlet (TRO) violations could help inform better enforcement strategies. Methods In this study, we used Bayesian index regression models to determine if tobacco sales to minors violations across Virginia (2012–2021) were related to store characteristics and neighborhood deprivation and identify geographic areas at significantly elevated risk for violations after adjusting for these factors. Results Results show that there were multiple factors associated with a higher likelihood of tobacco sales violations. Store type was an important factor, as grocery stores and pharmacies had significantly lowered likelihood of violations compared with convenience stores. Being located near another TRO was significantly associated with increased risk of sales to a minor. Neighborhood deprivation was also positively associated with TRO sales violations. Further, there were statistically higher likelihood of sales violations occurring in specific areas (e.g., southwest and southeast) of the state that were not explained by neighborhood deprivation and store attributes. Conclusions Together, results highlight the need to better understand where and why TRO sales violations are occurring in order to improve efforts aimed at monitoring and remediating TRO sales violations."
https://openalex.org/W3180590303,"Marafiviruses are capable of persistent infection in a range of plants that have importance to the agriculture and biofuel industries. Although the genomes of a few of these viruses have been studied in-depth, the composition and processing of the polyproteins produced from their main ORFs have not. The Marafivirus polyprotein consists of essential proteins that form the viral replicase, as well as structural proteins for virus assembly. It has been proposed that Marafiviruses code for cysteine proteases within their polyproteins, which act as endopeptidases to autocatalytically cleave the polyprotein into functional domains. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that Marafivirus endopeptidases may have deubiquitinating activity, which has been shown to enhance viral replication by downregulating viral protein degradation by the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasomal pathway as well as tampering with cell signaling associated with innate antiviral responses in other positive-sense ssRNA viruses. Here, we provide the first evidence of cysteine proteases from six different Marafiviruses that harbor deubiquitinating activity and reveal intragenus differences toward Ub linkage types. We also examine the structural basis of the endopeptidase/deubiquitinase from the Marafivirus type member, maize rayado fino virus. Structures of the enzyme alone and bound to Ub reveal marked structural rearrangements that occur upon binding of Ub and provide insights into substrate specificity and differences that set it apart from other viral cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W3181030765,"Background Research has revealed that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections are important contributors to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in populations. In Egypt, the true prevalence of infections is veiled due to the low number of screening tests. The aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity rate as well the seroprevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before the ultimate development of a second wave of the epidemic in Cairo, Egypt. Methods Our study was carried out between May 5 and the end of October 2020. It included all patients requiring admission to Ain Shams University hospitals. An interview questionnaire was used to collect demographic and clinical data. Laboratory tests for all participants included RT-PCR and total antibody assay for SARS-CoV-2. Results A total of 4,313 subjects were enrolled in our study, with females representing 56% of the sample. Adults and middle-aged individuals represented around 60% of the study sample. The positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 PCR was 3.84% (95% CI 3.29–4.48), and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence was 29.82% (95% CI: 28.16–31.51). Males showed a higher risk for getting the COVID-19 infection, while middle-age group had significantly higher antibody seroprevalence rates. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 infection imposes a high burden on the community as detected by high seroprevalence rates."

In addition, long-term mortality of more than 1 year is inadequately known. In this large population-based study we investigated age and sex differences, temporal trends, and factors affecting the LOS in patients with IE and in-hospital, 1-year, 5-year and 10-year mortality of IE. Data on patients (≥18 years of age) admitted to hospital due to IE in Finland during 2005–2014 were collected retrospectively from nationwide obligatory registries. We included 2166 patients in our study. Of the patients 67.8% were men. Women were older than men (mean age 63.3 vs. 59.5, p&lt;0.001). The median LOS was 20.0 days in men and 18.0 in women, p = 0.015. In the youngest patients (18–39 years) the median LOS was significantly longer than in the oldest patients (≥80 years) (24.0 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.014). In-hospital mortality was 10% with no difference between men and women. Mortality was 22.7% at 1 year whereas 5- and 10-year mortality was 37.5% and 48.5%, respectively. The 5-year and 10-year mortality was higher in women (HR 1.18, p = 0.034; HR 1.18, p = 0.021). Both in-hospital and long-term mortality increased significantly with aging and comorbidity burden. Both mortality and LOS remained stable over the study period. In conclusion, men had longer hospital stays due to IE compared to women. The 5- and 10-year mortality was higher in women. The mortality of IE or LOS did not change over time."
https://openalex.org/W3179761365,"MAGEL2 encodes the L2 member of the melanoma-associated antigen gene (MAGE) protein family, truncating mutations of which can cause Schaaf-Yang syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder. MAGEL2 is also inactivated in Prader-Willi syndrome, which overlaps clinically and mechanistically with Schaaf-Yang syndrome. Studies to date have only investigated the C-terminal portion of the MAGEL2 protein, containing the MAGE homology domain that interacts with RING-E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases to form protein complexes that modify protein ubiquitination. In contrast, the N-terminal portion of the MAGEL2 protein has never been studied. Here, we find that MAGEL2 has a low-complexity intrinsically disordered N-terminus rich in Pro-Xn-Gly motifs that is predicted to mediate liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. We used proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify MAGEL2-proximal proteins, then clustered these proteins into functional networks. We determined that coding mutations analogous to disruptive mutations in other MAGE proteins alter these networks in biologically relevant ways. Proteins identified as proximal to the N-terminal portion of MAGEL2 are primarily involved in mRNA metabolic processes and include three mRNA N 6-methyladenosine (m6A)-binding YTHDF proteins and two RNA interference-mediating TNRC6 proteins. We found that YTHDF2 coimmunoprecipitates with MAGEL2, and coexpression of MAGEL2 reduces the nuclear accumulation of YTHDF2 after heat shock. We suggest that the N-terminal region of MAGEL2 may have a role in RNA metabolism and in particular the regulation of mRNAs modified by m6A methylation. These results provide mechanistic insight into pathogenic MAGEL2 mutations associated with Schaaf-Yang syndrome and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3180716921,"The maintenance of seedling diversity of animal-dispersed tree species is fundamental for the structure and function of forest patches in fragmented tropical rainforests. Nonetheless, the effects of landscape structure at different spatial scales on α- and β-diversity of tree seedling communities are recently explored. Using a multi-scale approach, we assessed the relative effect of landscape composition and configuration on α- and β-diversity of animal-dispersed seedlings within 16 forest patches in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We assessed these effects at 13 spatial scales (from 300 to 1500 m radius, at 100 m intervals) for three metrics of effective number of species considering α- and β-diversity. We found that α-diversity was largely affected by landscape composition and β-diversity by landscape configuration. On the one hand, the amount of secondary forest influenced α-diversity. Additionally, species richness increased in landscapes with highly aggregated forest patches. On the other hand, β-diversity was affected positively by forest fragmentation and negatively by the edge contrast of forest patches with the surrounding matrix. Our findings indicate that landscape configuration is a strong driver of seedling diversity in highly deforested rainforests. Promoting forest patches and secondary forests through payment for ecosystem services' programs, favoring matrix quality within land-sharing schemes of smallholder agriculture and secondary forest management, and identifying restoration opportunities for assisted or unassisted natural regeneration are urgently needed for conservation of seedling diversity in human-modified tropical landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W3181914961,"Most microbes in the natural environment are difficult to cultivate. Thus, culture-independent analysis for microbial community structure is important for the understanding of its ecological functions. An immense ribosomal RNA sequence collection is available from phylogenetic research on organisms in all domains. These sequences are available for use in genetic research. However, the amplicon-seq process using PCR requires the construction of a sequence library. Construction can introduce bias into quantitative analyses, and each domain of species needs its own primer set. Total RNA sequencing has the advantage of analyzing an entire microbial community, including bacteria, archea, and eukaryote, at once. Such analysis yields large amounts of ribosomal RNA sequences that can be used for analysis without PCR bias. Evaluation using total RNA-seq for quantitative analysis of microbial communities and comparison with amplicon-seq is still rare. In the present study, we developed a mapping-based total RNA-seq analysis to obtain quantitative information on microbial community structure and compared our results with ordinary amplicon-seq methods. We read total RNA sequences from a commercially available mock community (ATCC MSA-2003) and divided reads into small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) origin reads and others, such as mRNA origin reads. We then mapped ssrRNA origin reads on annotated assembled contigs and obtained quantitative results under several analysis strategies. Removal of low complexity sequences, sorting ssrRNA with paired-in mode, and performing homology-based taxonomical assignments (BLAST+ or vsearch) showed superior outcomes to other strategies. Results with this approach showed a median relative abundance among ten mock community members of ~10%; ordinary amplicon-seq showed a much lower percentage. Thus, total RNA-seq can be a powerful tool for analyzing microbial community structure and is not limited to analyzing gene expression profiling of microbiomes."

This study was conducted to identify the potential socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with CS delivery in Bangladesh. Data obtained from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014 has been used for this study. The prevalence of CS delivery among Bangladeshi mothers was 24% (Urban: 36.9%, Rural: 17.9%). A two-level logistic regression showed that mothers having delivery in the private sector or private hospital (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 38.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 29.58 to 50.62), mother's age 25-35 years (AOR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.26 to 2.37), wealth index average (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.27) and rich (AOR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.29 to 2.51), antenatal visit 1-2 (AOR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.47 to 3.64) and ≥ 3 (AOR = 3.68, 95% CI = 2.35 to 5.76), overweight mothers (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.90), multiple births (AOR = 3.87, 95% CI = 1.15 to 12.58), husband's occupation professional/technical/managerial (AOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.15 to 2.47) were significantly more prone to CS delivery. Also, place of residence, number of family members, birth order, child's size during birth, and divisions of Bangladesh, were potentially associated with CS delivery. The current epidemiological findings and evidence suggest adopting and implementing some urgent clinical practices and strict guidelines in the healthcare system to avoid unnecessary CS delivery in Bangladesh."

However, few studies have revealed the characteristics associated with physician well-being and work-life integration using a machine learning approach. To investigate predictive factors of well-being and obtain insights into work-life integration, the survey was conducted by letter mail in a sample of Japanese physicians. A total of 422 responses were collected from 846 physicians. The mean age was 47.9 years, males constituted 83.3% of the physicians, and 88.6% were considered to be well. The most accurate machine learning model showed a mean area under the curve of 0.72. The mean permutation importance of career satisfaction, work hours per week, existence of family support, gender, and existence of power harassment were 0.057, 0.022, 0.009, 0.01, and 0.006, respectively. Using a machine learning model, physician well-being could be predicted. It seems to be influenced by multiple factors, such as career satisfaction, work hours per week, family support, gender, and power harassment. Career satisfaction has the highest impact, while long work hours have a negative effect on well-being. These findings support the need for organizational interventions to promote physician well-being and improve the quality of medical care."
https://openalex.org/W3181928219,"White croaker ( Pennahia argentata ) is a commercially important but overexploited species that is often caught in trawl fishery of the South China Sea (SCS). The codend size selectivity for this species in the local commercial trawl fishery is of concern when considering the established minimum landing size (MLS). This study investigated the size selectivity of white croaker for six different diamond-mesh codends with mesh size from 25 to 54 mm. We paid special attention to two codends, made with meshes of 25 and 40 mm in size, which are currently used according to the regulations established in the SCS. The results demonstrated that the legal codends do not perform satisfactorily in the fishing grounds where juvenile white croaker is relatively abundant. This is because at a length similar to the minimum landing size of the species (MLS = 15.0 cm), all white croaker were retained, and the estimated discard ratio was &gt;97% in both cases of legal codends. Our study showed that by increasing the mesh size, the size selection of tested codends could be improved for white croaker, and the retention rates for juvenile fish would decrease. However, none codend was proved efficient to release undersized white croaker suggesting that other gear design changes may be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W3182213823,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease in childhood. A sterile collection of urine samples using suprapubic aspiration (SPA) and bladder catheterization (BC) is helpful for rapid and accurate diagnosis of UTI in infants. With the advent of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), the use of ultrasound by non-radiologists at the patient's bedside, great advancement has been noticed in various medical fields. Considering the importance and advantages of using POCUS in the physical examination and guiding procedures, the authors aimed to compare urine sampling's success rate by SPA, BC, and POCUS guided SPA (POCUS-SPA) in infants performed by three pediatricians.This study is a randomized clinical trial conducted on 114 neonates and infants with suspected UTI admitted to 17-Shahrivar children's hospital from April 2017 to September 2019. Neonates and infants were randomly assigned to three groups of BC, SPA, and POCUS-SPA. The primary outcome was the success of sampling defined by obtaining 1cc of urine in each method. The secondary outcome was assessing the pain level.Results showed that the POCUS-SPA had the highest success rate in urine sampling, and a statistically significant relation was noted among the three groups (P = 0.0001). From 38 patients in each group, 37 patients of POCUS-SPA (97.4%), 34 patients of BC (89.5%), and 23 patients of SPA (60.5%) had a successful sampling. Most of the patients in all three groups experienced severe pain.In the current study, results showed that the POCUS-SPA significantly increased the success rate of urine sampling and most of the patients in all three groups had severe pain. Based on the shortage of access to radiologists in emergency setups, it seems that the POCUS-SPA by the pediatricians can be one of the most appropriate and applicable diagnostic methods in infants with UTI."

https://openalex.org/W3177568950,"Considering beneficial effects of leisure activities in later life on well-being and health, we investigated which type of social network among older adults is associated with starting their participation in leisure activities. We used data from a longitudinal Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) conducted in Japan every three years from 2010 to 2016. We extracted types of social networks of older adults who did not participate in leisure activities in 2013 and responded to items related to social networks (n = 3436) relying on latent class analysis to examine changes in leisure activity participation over a three-year period within each latent class while controlling for participants’ activity in 2010. As a result, we identified five latent classes of social networks: the Neighborhood network, the Restricted network, which is characterized by limited social contacts, the Colleagues network, the Same-Interest network, and the Diverse network, from the most to the least prevalent. We found that members of the Neighborhood (Cohen’s d = 0.161) and Same-Interest networks ( d = 0.660) were significantly more likely to, and members of the Diverse ( d = 0.124) and Colleague networks ( d = 0.060) were not significantly more likely to start leisure activities than those in the Restricted network. Furthermore, we found that lower age, better mental health, and higher education level were positively associated with starting participation in leisure activities in some latent classes. Horticulture or gardening was most likely to be chosen across all latent classes. Supporting the formation of social networks facilitating leisure activities, and recommending activities that were likely to be selected could be one solution for getting and keeping older adults active."
https://openalex.org/W3180406845,"The study of seabird behaviour has largely relied on animal-borne tags to gather information, requiring interpretation to estimate at-sea behaviours. Details of shallow-diving birds' foraging are less known than deep-diving species due to difficulty in identifying shallow dives from biologging devices. Development of smaller video loggers allow a direct view of these birds' behaviours, at the cost of short battery capacity. However, recordings from video loggers combined with relatively low power usage accelerometers give a means to develop a reliable foraging detection method. Combined video and acceleration loggers were attached to streaked shearwaters in Funakoshi-Ohshima Island (39°24'N,141°59'E) during the breeding season in 2018. Video recordings were classified into behavioural categories (rest, transit, and foraging) and a detection method was generated from the acceleration signals. Two foraging behaviours, surface seizing and foraging dives, are reported with video recordings. Surface seizing was comprised of successive take-offs and landings (mean duration 0.6 and 1.5s, respectively), while foraging dives were shallow subsurface dives (3.2s mean duration) from the air and water surface. Birds were observed foraging close to marine predators, including dolphins and large fish. Results of the behaviour detection method were validated against video recordings, with mean true and false positive rates of 90% and 0%, 79% and 5%, and 66% and <1%, for flight, surface seizing, and foraging dives, respectively. The detection method was applied to longer duration acceleration and GPS datasets collected during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons. Foraging trips lasted between 1 - 8 days, with birds performing on average 16 surface seizing events and 43 foraging dives per day, comprising <1% of daily activity, while transit and rest took up 55 and 40%, respectively. This foraging detection method can address the difficulties of recording shallow-diving foraging behaviour and provides a means to measure activity budgets across shallow diving seabird species."

https://openalex.org/W3181432646,"The Hippo pathway is a key regulatory pathway that is tightly regulated by mechanical cues such as tension, pressure, and contact with the extracellular matrix and other cells. At the distal end of the pathway is the yes-associated protein (YAP), a well-characterized transcriptional regulator. Through binding to transcription factors such as the TEA Domain TFs (TEADs) YAP regulates expression of several genes involved in cell fate, proliferation and death decisions. While the function of YAP as direct transcriptional regulator has been extensively characterized, only a small number of studies examined YAP function as a regulator of gene expression via microRNAs. We utilized bioinformatic approaches, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA-Seq, to identify potential new targets of YAP regulation and identified miR-30a as a YAP target gene in Schwann cells. We find that YAP binds to the promoter and regulates the expression of miR-30a. Moreover, we identify several YAP-regulated genes that are putative miR-30a targets and focus on two of these, protein tyrosine pohosphatase non-receptor type 13 (PTPN13) and Kruppel like factor 9. We find that YAP regulation of Schwann cell proliferation and death is mediated, to a significant extent, through miR-30a regulation of PTPN13 in Schwann cells. These findings identify a new regulatory function by YAP, mediated by miR-30a, to downregulate expression of PTPN13 and Kruppel like factor 9. These studies expand our understanding of YAP function as a regulator of miRNAs and illustrate the complexity of YAP transcriptional functions."

The MLR distribution differed between CD4 count categories (p < 0.01), with a broader range of values in TST negative participants with a low CD4 count (≤ 250 cells/mm3), likely reflecting HIV immunosuppression. MLR was associated with a positive TST (OR 0.78 per 0.1 increase, 95% CI 0.59, 0.97) in bivariate analysis but not in multivariate regression analysis (aOR 0.83 for every 0.1 increase, 95% CI 0.60, 1.08).In ART-naïve adults without symptoms suggestive of active TB, MLR was not independently associated with TST positivity and is thus unlikely to be a useful alternative to TST. Future research should focus on development of a cheap, simple and accurate biomarker to identify those people benefiting most from preventive TB therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3182950214,"This study provides psycholinguistic and affective norms for 1,252 Spanish idiomatic expressions. A total of 965 Spanish native speakers rated the idioms in 7 subjective variables: familiarity, knowledge of the expression, decomposability, literality, predictability, valence and arousal. Correlational analyses showed that familiarity has a strong positive correlation with knowledge, suggesting that the knowledge of the figurative meaning of an idiom is highly related to its frequency of use. Familiarity has a moderate positive correlation with final word predictability, indicating that the more familiar an idiom is rated, the more predictable it tends to be. Decomposability shows a moderate positive correlation with literality, suggesting that those idioms whose figurative meaning is easier to deduce from their constituents tend to have a plausible literal meaning. In affective terms, Spanish idioms tend to convey more negative (66%) than positive meanings (33%). Furthermore, valence and arousal show a quadratic relationship, in line with the typical U-shaped relationship found for single words, which means that the more emotionally valenced an idiom is rated, the more arousing it is considered to be. This database will provide researchers with a large pool of stimuli for studying the representation and processing of idioms in healthy and clinical populations."

Undernutrition was defined as per World Health Organization based on body mass index (BMI) for adults (undernutrition 16-18.4 and severe undernutrition <16 kg/m2) and BMI relative to the mean for children (undernutrition 2SD-3SD and severe undernutrition < 3SDs below mean). Univariate and multivariate models of TST positivity (> five mm) were calculated using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations.Among 1189 HHCs, 342 were children (age 5-17 years) and 847 were adults. Prevalence of TST positivity in well-nourished, undernourished and severely undernourished children was 135/251 (53.8%), 32/68 (47.1%), and 7/23 (30.4%) respectively; among adults, prevalence of TST positivity was 304/708 (42.9%), 43/112 (38.4%) and 12/26 (46.2%), respectively. Severe undernutrition in children was associated with decreased odds of TST positivity (adjusted odds ratio 0.3; 95%CI 0.1-0.9).Severe undernutrition in children was associated with decreased odds of TST positivity. False-negative TSTs may result from undernutrition; caution is warranted when interpreting negative results in undernourished populations."
https://openalex.org/W3179188789,"The 2-ketopropyl-coenzyme M oxidoreductase/carboxylase (2-KPCC) enzyme is the only member of the disulfide oxidoreductase (DSOR) family of enzymes, which are important for reductively cleaving S-S bonds, to have carboxylation activity. 2-KPCC catalyzes the conversion of 2-ketopropyl-coenzyme M to acetoacetate, which is used as a carbon source, in a controlled reaction to exclude protons. A conserved His-Glu motif present in DSORs is key in the protonation step; however, in 2-KPCC, the dyad is substituted by Phe-His. Here, we propose that this difference is important for coupling carboxylation with C-S bond cleavage. We substituted the Phe-His dyad in 2-KPCC to be more DSOR like, replacing the phenylalanine with histidine (F501H) and the histidine with glutamate (H506E), and solved crystal structures of F501H and the double variant F501H_H506E. We found that F501 protects the enolacetone intermediate from protons and that the F501H variant strongly promotes protonation. We also provided evidence for the involvement of the H506 residue in stabilizing the developing charge during the formation of acetoacetate, which acts as a product inhibitor in the WT but not the H506E variant enzymes. Finally, we determined that the F501H substitution promotes a DSOR-like charge transfer interaction with flavin adenine dinucleotide, eliminating the need for cysteine as an internal base. Taken together, these results indicate that the 2-KPCC dyad is responsible for selectively promoting carboxylation and inhibiting protonation in the formation of acetoacetate."

Twenty-nine dogs were followed quarterly for 12 months by clinical evaluation, arterial blood pressure, electrocardiography, doppler echocardiography, thoracic radiography and laboratory tests including inflammatory mediators and cardiac biomarker blood concentrations. The dogs were classified in stages B2 and C, according to the classification proposed by ACVIM 2019. They were randomly assigned to either ω-3 group (ω-3G) or control group (CG). The ingestion of ω-3 reduced the chance of developing arrhythmias by 2.96 times (p = 0.003). The vertebral heart size (VHS) measurements were higher in the control group (p = 0.033). In conclusion, at the dosages used in this study, ω-3 dietary supplementation reduces the volumetric overload, has antiarrhythmic effect and keeps dogs with B2 and C stages of MMVD in milder stages of the disease."

Earlier research on memory conformity suggests that (1) subjects were more likely to conform to confederate with high confidence; (2) subjects with low confidence on their memory accuracy were more likely to conform, and; (3) this subjective confidence could be adjusted by social manipulations. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how the confidence levels of ours and others may interact and produce a combined effect on our degree of conformity. More importantly, is memory conformity, defined by a complete adoption of the opposite side, the result of a gradual accumulation of subtler changes at the confidence level, i.e., a buildup of confidence conformity? Here, we followed participant's confidence transformation quantitatively over three confederate sessions in a memory test. After studying a set of human motion videos, participants had to answer simultaneously whether a target or lure video had appeared before by indicating their side (i.e., Yes/No) and their associated confidence rating. Participants were allowed to adjust their responses as they were being shown randomly-generated confederates' answers and confidence values. Results show that participants indeed demonstrated confidence conformity. Interestingly, they tended to become committed to their side early on and gain confidence gradually over subsequent sessions. This polarizing behaviour may be explained by two kinds of preferences: (1) Participant's confidence enhancement towards same-sided confederates was greater in magnitude compared to the decrement towards an opposite-sided confederate; and (2) Participants had the most effective confidence boost when the same-sided confederates shared similar, but not considerably different, confidence level to theirs. In other words, humans exhibit side- and similarity-biases during confidence conformity."

The results showed that the optimum conditions for ultrasound-assisted preparation of calcium malate from bovine bone were as follows: solid-liquid ratio 1:15, solid-acid ratio 1:1.5, ultrasonic power 200 W, ultrasonic temperature 35°C, and ultrasonication time 17 min. The efficiency of calcium recovery was 66.16%, and the purity was 92.54%. After three ultrasonic treatments of 17 min each, the calcium malate conversion rate of bovine bone reached 95.73%. Animal experiments showed that feeding bovine bone-derived calcium malate significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and bone calcium content, reduced tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, and maintained the balance of serum calcium and phosphorus. These results indicated that the ultrasonic method effectively ionized calcium in bovine bone, which provides a reference point for the industrial production of calcium products with bovine bone as the raw material."

https://openalex.org/W3182317162,"Quercetin is a polyphenolic flavonoid occurring in leaves, stems, flowers and fruits of many plants. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is used as a natural therapeutic agent with a broad spectrum of activities (antioxidant, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial and antiviral). Moreover, quercetin affects function of the reproductive tract, however the knowledge of this activity is still fragmentary. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of quercetin on the contractile activity of the porcine myometrium collected from immature (n = 6), cyclic (n = 6) and early pregnant (n = 6) gilts. Strips of the myometrium (comprising longitudinal and circular layer) were resected from the middle part of the uterine horns and the isometric contractions were recorded. After 60-90 min of preincubation, the strips were stimulated with quercetin in increasing (10-13-10-1 M) concentrations and the changes in the tension amplitude and frequency of contractions were measured. Quercetin decreased (P<0.01-0.001) the amplitude of contractions at concentrations 10-11-10-1 M and 10-10-10-1 M in cyclic and early pregnant groups, respectively. The frequency of contractions decreased in all groups but was the highest (at concentrations 10-11-10-1 M; P<0.05-0.001) in the cyclic group and the lowest (at concentrations 10-5-10-1 M; P<0.01) in the immature group. The tension decreased only in the cyclic group after quercetin administration in high concentrations (10-6-10-1 M; P<0.05-0.01). The results indicate that quercetin causes relaxation of the porcine uterine smooth muscle but this activity is strongly related to the physiological status of the gilts."
