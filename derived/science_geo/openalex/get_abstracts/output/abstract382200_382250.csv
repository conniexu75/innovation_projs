https://openalex.org/W2152131288,"After central nervous system (CNS) demyelination—such as occurs during multiple sclerosis—there is often spontaneous regeneration of myelin sheaths, mainly by oligodendrocytes but also by Schwann cells. The origins of the remyelinating cells have not previously been established. We have used Cre-lox fate mapping in transgenic mice to show that PDGFRA/NG2-expressing glia, a distributed population of stem/progenitor cells in the adult CNS, produce the remyelinating oligodendrocytes and almost all of the Schwann cells in chemically induced demyelinated lesions. In contrast, the great majority of reactive astrocytes in the vicinity of the lesions are derived from preexisting FGFR3-expressing cells, likely to be astrocytes. These data resolve a long-running debate about the origins of the main players in CNS remyelination and reveal a surprising capacity of CNS precursors to generate Schwann cells, which normally develop from the embryonic neural crest and are restricted to the peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2001765718,"Recent evidence suggests that a subpopulation of cancer cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), is responsible for tumor growth in colorectal cancer. However, the role of CSCs in colorectal cancer metastasis is unclear. Here, we identified a subpopulation of CD26(+) cells uniformly present in both the primary and metastatic tumors in colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis. Furthermore, in patients without distant metastasis at the time of presentation, the presence of CD26(+) cells in their primary tumors predicted distant metastasis on follow-up. Isolated CD26(+) cells, but not CD26(-) cells, led to development of distant metastasis when injected into the mouse cecal wall. CD26(+) cells were also associated with enhanced invasiveness and chemoresistance. Our findings have uncovered a critical role of CSCs in metastatic progression of cancer. Furthermore, the ability to predict metastasis based on analysis of CSC subsets in the primary tumor may have important clinical implication as a selection criterion for adjuvant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2101315990,"Adult stem cells have the ability to self-renew and to generate specialized cells. Self-renewal is dependent on extrinsic niche factors but few of those signals have been identified. In addition, stem cells tend to differentiate in the absence of the proper signals and are therefore difficult to maintain in cell culture. The mammary gland provides an excellent system to study self-renewal signals, because the organ develops postnatally, arises from stem cells, and is readily generated from transplanted cells. We show here that adult mammary glands contain a Wnt-responsive cell population that is enriched for stem cells. In addition, stem cells mutant for the negative-feedback regulator Axin2 and therefore sensitized to Wnt signals have a competitive advantage in mammary gland reconstitution assays. In cell culture experiments, exposure to purified Wnt protein clonally expands mammary stem cells for many generations and maintains their ability to generate functional glands in transplantation assays. We conclude that Wnt proteins serve as rate-limiting self-renewal signals acting directly on mammary stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063998346,"Human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) represent a multipotent cell stromal cell type with proven capacity to differentiate along an osteogenic lineage. This suggests that they may be used to heal defects of the craniofacial or appendicular skeleton. We sought to substantiate the use of undifferentiated hASCs in the regeneration of a non-healing mouse skeletal defect.Human ASCs were harvested from female lipoaspirate. Critical-sized (4 mm) calvarial defects were created in the parietal bone of adult male nude mice. Defects were either left empty, treated with an apatite coated PLGA scaffold alone, or a scaffold with human ASCs. MicroCT scans were obtained at stratified time points post-injury. Histology, in situ hybridization, and histomorphometry were performed. Near complete healing was observed among hASC engrafted calvarial defects. This was in comparison to control groups that showed little healing (*P<0.01). Human ASCs once engrafted differentiate down an osteogenic lineage, determined by qRT-PCR and histological co-expression assays using GFP labeled cells. ASCs were shown to persist within a defect site for two weeks (shown by sex chromosome analysis and quantified using Luciferase+ ASCs). Finally, rBMP-2 was observed to increase hASC osteogenesis in vitro and osseous healing in vivo.Human ASCs ossify critical sized mouse calvarial defects without the need for pre-differentiation. Recombinant differentiation factors such as BMP-2 may be used to supplement hASC mediated repair. Interestingly, ASC presence gradually dissipates from the calvarial defect site. This study supports the potential translation for ASC use in the treatment of human skeletal defects."
https://openalex.org/W2025175358,"Murine pluripotent stem cells can exist in two functionally distinct states, LIF-dependent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and bFGF-dependent epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). However, human pluripotent cells so far seemed to assume only an epiblast-like state. Here we demonstrate that human iPSC reprogramming in the presence of LIF yields human stem cells that display morphological, molecular, and functional properties of murine ESCs. We termed these hLR5 iPSCs because they require the expression of five ectopic reprogramming factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc, and Nanog, to maintain this more naive state. The cells are “metastable” and upon ectopic factor withdrawal they revert to standard human iPSCs. Finally, we demonstrate that the hLR5 state facilitates gene targeting, and as such provides a powerful tool for the generation of recombinant human pluripotent stem cell lines.

An altered derivation protocol generates hiPSCs with mESC-like properties The resulting hLR5 iPSCs are LIF responsive Maintenance of the altered state requires reprogramming factor expression hLR5 cells facilitate gene targeting in human pluripotent cells Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were first derived in 1981 from the inner cell mass (ICM) of murine preimplantation blastocyst embryos (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J. Kaufman M.H. Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos.Nature. 1981; 292: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (6065) Google Scholar, Martin, 1981Martin G.R.

USA. 1981; 78: 7634-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4064) Google Scholar). ESCs are pluripotent, meaning they are able to expand indefinitely in vitro while retaining the capacity to generate derivatives of all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of murine ES cells (mESCs) was a major breakthrough in developmental biology, because it enabled the study of mammalian gene function in vivo, via transgenic and knockout technologies. The subsequent derivation of human ES cells (hESCs) raised the expectation that these cells would similarly revolutionize our insights into human development and disease. Unfortunately, human pluripotent stem cells are remarkably resilient to nonviral genetic manipulation and to date only a handful of human knockin or knockout cell lines exist. As a result, the application of human pluripotent stem cells has been more limited than previously anticipated. Although both human and murine ESCs are derived from blastocyst-stage embryos, they demonstrate profound differences (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11504) Google Scholar). Murine ESCs grow in three-dimensional, tightly packed colonies with a population doubling time of approximately 16 hr and their maintenance is dependent on LIF and BMP4 growth factor signaling (Smith et al., 1988Smith A.G.

In contrast, human ESCs form flattened two-dimensional colonies and are maintained in a bFGF and Activin A/TGF-β signaling-dependent manner (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M. Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts.Science. 1998; 282: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11504) Google Scholar). hESCs proliferate slowly, with a population doubling time averaging 36 hr. Epigenetically, human and murine ESCs display a different X chromosome inactivation pattern and promoter occupancy by pluripotency transcription factors (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). In addition, hESCs are passaged as small clumps of cells, and most hESC lines cannot be passaged as single cells by trypsin digest. The inability of hESC lines to grow from single cells greatly impedes genetic modification of these cells, because the introduction of transgenes is typically followed by clonal selection. Two reports on the derivation of murine epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) recently provided a new perspective on the nature of human ESCs (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). EpiSCs are derived from postimplantation murine epiblast embryos under culture conditions similar to hESC culture conditions. EpiSCs display many of the characteristics of human ESCs including their dependence on bFGF/Activin A signaling, their flattened colony morphology, their slower proliferation rate compared to murine ESCs, their X-inactivation status, and their requirement to be passaged as small clumps of cells (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L.

New cell lines from mouse epiblast share defining features with human embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2007; 448: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). The culture dynamics and the specific characteristics of murine ESCs and EpiSCs appear to be largely determined by the growth factor conditions under which these cell types are derived and maintained. Indeed, recent work from our group demonstrates that culture growth factor conditions play a critical role in defining the pluripotent stem cell state (Chou et al., 2008Chou Y.F. Chen H.H. Eijpe M. Yabuuchi A. Chenoweth J.G. Tesar P. Lu J. McKay R.D. Geijsen N.

Intriguingly, although pluripotent stem cells can be stably derived and propagated from multiple species in an epiblast-like state, including the rat and “nonpermissive” mouse strains, the LIF-dependent pluripotent state appears to be unstable in these species (Buehr et al., 2008Buehr M. Meek S. Blair K. Yang J. Ure J. Silva J. McLay R. Hall J. Ying Q.L. Smith A.

However, the LIF-dependent pluripotent state can be stabilized through the constitutive ectopic expression of one or more of the reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc), which induce the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

In the nonpermissive NOD mouse strain, for example, the constitutive ectopic expression of either Klf4 or cMyc is sufficient to allow the derivation of ES-like cells from blastocyst embryos (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W. Cassady J.P. Staerk J. Carey B.W. Lengner C.J. Foreman R. Love J. et al.Metastable pluripotent states in NOD-mouse-derived ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway can replace some of the reprogramming factors during iPSC generation (Li and Ding, 2009Li W. Ding S. Small molecules that modulate embryonic stem cell fate and somatic cell reprogramming.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 31: 36-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These inhibitors can similarly stabilize the LIF-dependent mES-like pluripotent stem cell state from both the nonpermissive NOD mouse strain and the rat (Buehr et al., 2008Buehr M. Meek S. Blair K. Yang J. Ure J. Silva J. McLay R. Hall J. Ying Q.L. Smith A.

Xiao H. et al.Generation of induced pluripotent stem cell lines from adult rat cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the LIF-dependent pluripotent state is metastable in these species, meaning that it is dependent on either the constitutive expression of ectopic reprogramming factors or the continued inhibition of GSK3β and/or the MAPK signaling pathways. Although distinct pluripotent stem cell states are known to exist in mouse and rat, they have thus far not been described for human stem cells. A recent report demonstrates that stable human iPS cells (hiPSCs) can be derived in the presence of LIF and inhibitors of GSK3β and the TGF-β and MEK/ERK signaling pathways (Li et al., 2009Li W. Wei W. Zhu S. Zhu J. Shi Y. Lin T. Hao E. Hayek A. Deng H. Ding S. Generation of rat and human induced pluripotent stem cells by combining genetic reprogramming and chemical inhibitors.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). However, these cells appear to be molecularly identical to conventional hiPSCs. We used hiPSC derivation as a tool to investigate the influence of growth factor signaling on the human stem cell pluripotent state. Here we demonstrate the derivation of human cell lines that display many characteristics of murine ESCs including a dome-shaped colony morphology, the ability to be propagated by trypsin digest and to clonally grow from single cells, and the activation of LIF downstream signaling pathways. We demonstrate that in this state, the human cells are more amenable to the introduction of transgenes and allow homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting. The LIF state is metastable, as indicated by the fact that it depends on the constitutive expression of ectopic reprogramming factors. Yet a combination of growth factors and inhibition of MEK-kinase signaling allows the conversion of the human LIF-iPSCs to a stable, pluripotent human iPSC state. Our findings support the idea that, analogous to mouse strains and the rat, human iPSCs adopt murine ESC properties, when the cells are derived in the presence of LIF and ectopic reprogramming factors. Importantly, this novel state facilitates homologous recombination-mediated gene targeting in human stem cells. As such, the intermediate iPSC state described here can be a useful tool in research and future cell therapies. We used the recently reported induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) strategy to explore the possibility of deriving human iPSCs in the presence of LIF. The five reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, c-MYC, and KLF4 were expressed in human fibroblast via a recently reported doxycyline-inducible lentiviral system (Figure 1A ; Maherali et al., 2008Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Rigamonti A. Utikal J. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K. A high-efficiency system for the generation and study of human induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were reprogrammed either directly from the primary fibroblasts or from so-called secondary fibroblasts, derived from differentiated “primary” hiPSCs (Maherali et al., 2008Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Rigamonti A. Utikal J. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K. A high-efficiency system for the generation and study of human induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). With either approach, reprogramming of human fibroblasts in the presence of LIF resulted in the formation of two types of colonies: transient, irregularly shaped colonies that deteriorated a few days after their first appearance (Figure S1A available online) and smaller, tightly packed colonies (Figure S1B). We picked individual colonies of the latter for further clonal analysis. These clones displayed the hallmark, tightly packed, bright, dome-shaped morphology of mESCs (Figure 1B), contrasting the flattened two-dimensional colony morphology of hESCs (Figure 1B). We designated these cells human LR5-iPSCs (hLR5) (human LIF + the constitutive expression of 5 reprogramming factors). Next we investigated the cell surface marker profile of the hLR5 cells. Murine and human pluripotent stem cells express a mutually exclusive complement of cell surface markers. SSEA1 is expressed on undifferentiated murine pluripotent stem cells whereas human pluripotent stem cells express the SSEA3, SSEA4, TRA-1-81, and TRA-1-60 cell surface markers. Flow cytometry analysis of the hLR5 cells revealed a marker profile that resembles the surface marker profile of mESCs (Figure 1C). hLR5 cells do not express the TRA-1-81 cell surface marker (Figure 1C) but demonstrated high expression of the SSEA1 cell surface marker, which is typically expressed on murine pluripotent stem cells (Figure 1C). A fourth clone, which was derived through direct reprogramming of human fibroblasts from a different genetic background, also lacked TRA-1-81 expression but expressed low SSEA1 levels, suggesting that the level of SSEA1 expression is heterogeneous between hLR5 clones of different genetic backgrounds. In addition to the general lack of TRA-1-81 expression, hLR5 cells also do not express SSEA3, SSEA4, and TRA-1-60, as tested by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (not shown). Unlike hESCs, the hLR5 cells can be propagated by trypsin digest. This result suggested that similar to mESCs, hLR5 cells are tolerant to passaging as single cells. Indeed, upon single cell sorting of hLR5 cells into 96-well plates, hLR5 clones re-emerged in approximately 22% of the wells (n = 10), similar to the efficiency of single-cell sorted mESCs (∼30%), whereas upon single-cell sorting of the trypsin-adapted HUES3 hESC line (Cowan et al., 2004Cowan C.A. Klimanskaya I. McMahon J. Atienza J. Witmyer J. Zucker J.P. Wang S. Morton C.C. McMahon A.P. Powers D. et al.Derivation of embryonic stem-cell lines from human blastocysts.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), no colonies re-emerged (n = 10). In addition, the hLR5 cells displayed a much higher proliferation rate than human ESCs or iPSCs, with a cell doubling time of approximately 22 hr (Figure 1D). The hLR5 proliferation rate is close to the mESC or miPSC proliferation rate (doubling time ∼16 hr) and much higher than the proliferation rate of hESCs or hiPSCs (doubling time ∼36 hr). The growth factor environment is known to be an important determinant of the stem cell pluripotent state (Brons et al., 2007Brons I.G. Smithers L.E. Trotter M.W. Rugg-Gunn P. Sun B. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Howlett S.K. Clarkson A. Ahrlund-Richter L.

In mESCs, LIF activates the JAK/STAT3 and the RAS/MEK/MAPK signaling pathways, which have opposing roles in mESC maintenance and differentiation. Activation of the JAK-Stat3 signaling pathway has been shown to be important for long-term self-renewal of mESCs, whereas the RAS/MAPK pathway drives mESC differentiation. Indeed, pharmacological inhibitors of the RAS/MEK/MAPK pathway have been shown to enhance mESC self-renewal and in combination with inhibitors of GSK3β allow growth factor-independent maintenance of pluripotent stem cells (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). hLR5 cells display many characteristics of murine ESCs, so we investigated the effect of LIF and its signaling pathways on these cells. As shown in Figure 2A , STAT3 phosphorylation is robustly stimulated in hLR5 cells in a LIF-dependent manner. Upon LIF activation of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade, STAT3 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus and directly activates downstream target genes. Immunofluorescence staining of STAT3 in hLR5 cells revealed nuclear translocation in response to LIF stimulation (Figure 2B). This translocation results in activation of STAT3 downstream target genes, including STAT3 itself as well as SOCS3 and the LIF receptor, indicating that this pathway is functionally active in response to LIF stimulation of the hLR5 cells (Figure 2C). Upon removal or substitution of LIF from the hLR5 culture media, SSEA1 expression waned (Figure 2D). In addition, we noticed a change in colony morphology (Figure 2E). Next we used specific inhibitors of JAK/STAT signaling or the MAPK/MEK signaling pathway to examine the roles of these pathways in hLR5 cells. SSEA1 cell surface marker expression was used as a readout. As shown in Figure 2F, inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 pathway resulted in a marked decrease of SSEA1 on hLR5 cells (Jak-inhibitor I [0.6 μM], gray shaded area), whereas specific inhibition of the MEK/ERK1/ERK2 pathway did not affect cell surface marker expression (PD98059 [50 μM], PD184352 [0.8 μM], and PD0325901 [1 μM], colored lines). Together these results indicate that LIF stimulation of hLR5 cells results in activation of the JAK-STAT3 signaling cascade and upregulation of downstream target genes whereas LIF withdrawal results in changes in hLR5 colony phenotype. However, LIF withdrawal does not result in hLR5 differentiation, perhaps because of the persistent doxycyclin-induced ectopic expression of reprogramming factors. Next we examined whether hLR5 cells could be stably propagated in the absence of ectopic reprogramming factors. As shown in Figure 3A , doxycycline withdrawal resulted in the rapid loss of hLR5 colony morphology, with all cells adopting a fibroblast-like appearance within 3 days. A similar dependence was found for rat iPSCs (Liao et al., 2009Liao J. Cui C. Chen S. Ren J. Chen J. Gao Y. Li H. Jia N. Cheng L. Xiao H. et al.Generation of induced pluripotent stem cell lines from adult rat cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 11-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and for iPSCs from the nonpermissive NOD mouse strain (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Markoulaki S. Mitalipova M. Cheng A.W. Cassady J.P. Staerk J. Carey B.W. Lengner C.J. Foreman R. Love J. et al.Metastable pluripotent states in NOD-mouse-derived ESCs.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The need for ectopic reprogramming factors suggested that in hLR5 cells, the endogenous pluripotency genes have not yet been fully activated. Q-PCR analysis of the expression of endogenous and ectopic pluripotency factors revealed that hLR5 cells fail to reactivate endogenous OCT4 and NANOG expression, while the expression of endogenous SOX2 and c-MYC are low (Figure 3B). Endogenous KLF4 was expressed at similar levels in hLR5 cells and human ESCs or iPSCs. We then analyzed the presence of activating and silencing histone marks at the promoter regions of critical regulators of pluripotency. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Q-PCR, we tested the presence of two histone marks: histone 3 lysine 4-trimethylation (H3K4me3), a histone mark that activates transcription (Pray-Grant et al., 2005Pray-Grant M.G.

Unexpectedly, ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed the presence of both marks at the promoter regions of SOX2, DNMT3b, and SALL4 (Figure 3C). The H3K4 and H3K27 methylation marks are simultaneously present in so-called bivalent domains, which in ESCs are often found at promoters of important transcriptional regulators of development (Bernstein et al., 2006Bernstein B.E. Mikkelsen T.S. Xie X. Kamal M. Huebert D.J. Cuff J. Fry B. Meissner A. Wernig M. Plath K. et al.A bivalent chromatin structure marks key developmental genes in embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2006; 125: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3737) Google Scholar). Bivalent domains result in transcriptional repression, but lead to a “poised” state that allows rapid activation or permanent repression by removing either one of the opposing histone marks and is consistent with the low-level endogenous expression of these genes in hLR5 cells (Figure 3B). ChIP-qPCR analysis of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks at the OCT4, NANOG, and REX1 promoters revealed the presence of the repressive H3K27me3 mark in the hLR5 cells, corroborating the absence of endogenous expression of these genes (Figure 3D). In somatic cells, OCT4 and NANOG are silenced through additional epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, which is thought to be a permanent transcriptional barrier. Indeed, DNA methylation has been shown to be a limiting step during iPSC reprogramming, and inhibition of DNA methylation can complete the reprogramming of partially reprogrammed iPSCs (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang H. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Bisulfite sequencing showed that, unexpectedly, the OCT4 promoter regions are hypomethylated in the hLR5 cells as compared to the parental BJ fibroblasts (Figure 3E). Together, these results suggest that hLR5 cells exist in a poised state of near pluripotency, in which some pluripotency genes, including SOX2, DNMT3b, and SALL4, are in a bivalent histone methylation state, whereas others, such as OCT4, NANOG, and REX1, still carry the transcriptionally repressive H3K27 methylation mark, but already display hypomethylation at the OCT4 promoter region. Surprisingly, in addition to the four common reprogramming factors, ectopic expression of NANOG is also required for the maintenance of the hLR5 state. By using the “secondary fibroblasts,” we analyzed hLR5 derivation in the presence or absence of ectopic NANOG expression (Figure 3F). iPSC reprogramming was induced with doxycycline via either conventional hESC medium (with bFGF) or in hLR5 conditions (LIF). Whereas in the presence of bFGF hiPSC colonies formed with or without ectopic NANOG (Figures 3F, part I), under hLR5 culture conditions colony formation is dependent on ectopic NANOG expression (Figure 3F, part II), demonstrating that NANOG is required for the de novo derivation of hLR5 cells. In addition, we explored the effect of ectopic NANOG expression when reactivating reprogramming factors in existing hiPSC"

However, the underlying mechanism of PEITC-induced cell death is not fully understood. Using LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate cancer cells as a model, we demonstrate that the PEITC-induced cell death is initiated by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to pharmacologic concentrations of PEITC resulted in ROS production, which correlated with inhibition of complex III activity, suppression of OXPHOS, and ATP depletion. These effects were not observed in a representative normal human prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC). The ROS production by PEITC treatment was not influenced by cyclosporin A. The Rho-0 variants of LNCaP and PC-3 cells were more resistant to PEITC-mediated ROS generation, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential compared with respective wild-type cells. The PEITC treatment resulted in activation of Bax in wild-type LNCaP and PC-3 cells, but not in their respective Rho-0 variants. Furthermore, RNA interference of Bax and Bak conferred significant protection against PEITC-induced apoptosis. The Rho-0 variants of LNCaP and PC-3 cells also resisted PEITC-mediated autophagy. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insight into the molecular circuitry of PEITC-induced cell death involving ROS production due to inhibition of complex III and OXPHOS.

https://openalex.org/W2148056149,"Lipoxins (LXs) are endogenously produced eicosanoids with well-described anti-inflammatory and proresolution activities, stimulating nonphlogistic phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. LXA4 and the glucocorticoid-derived annexin A1 peptide (Ac2–26) bind to a common G-proteincoupled receptor, termed FPR2/ALX. However, direct evidence of the involvement of FPR2/ALX in the anti-inflammatory and proresolution activity of LXA4 is still to be investigated. Here we describe FPR2/ALX trafficking in response to LXA4 and Ac2–26 stimulation. We have transfected cells with HA-tagged FPR2/ALX and studied receptor trafficking in unstimulated, LXA4 (1–10 nM)- and Ac2–26 (30 µM)-treated cells using multiple approaches that include immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling of cryosections, and ELISA and investigated receptor trafficking in agonist-stimulated phagocytosis. We conclude that PKC-dependent internalization of FPR2/ALX is required for phagocytosis. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from mice in which the FPR2/ALX ortholog Fpr2 had been deleted, we observed the nonredundant function for this receptor in LXA4 and Ac2–26 stimulated phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. LXA4 stimulated phagocytosis 1.7-fold above basal (P< 0.001) by BMDMs from wild-type mice, whereas no effect was found on BMDMs from Fpr2-/- mice. Similarly, Ac2–26 stimulates phagocytosis by BMDMs from wild-type mice 1.5-fold above basal (P<0.05). However, Ac2–26 failed to stimulate phagocytosis by BMDMs isolated from Fpr2-/- mice relative to vehicle. These data reveal novel and complex mechanisms of the FPR2/ALX receptor trafficking and functionality in the resolution of inflammation.—Maderna, P., Cottell, D.

https://openalex.org/W2063986949,"The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein is overexpressed in a variety of cancers, particularly leukemias. In some cell types this is the result of enhanced stability of bcl-2 mRNA, which is controlled by elements in its 3'-untranslated region. Nucleolin is one of the proteins that binds to bcl-2 mRNA, thereby increasing its half-life. Here, we examined the site on the bcl-2 3'-untranslated region that is bound by nucleolin as well as the protein binding domains important for bcl-2 mRNA recognition. RNase footprinting and RNA fragment binding assays demonstrated that nucleolin binds to a 40-nucleotide region at the 5' end of the 136-nucleotide bcl-2 AU-rich element (ARE(bcl-2)). The first two RNA binding domains of nucleolin were sufficient for high affinity binding to ARE(bcl-2). In RNA decay assays, ARE(bcl-2) transcripts were protected from exosomal decay by the addition of nucleolin. AUF1 has been shown to recruit the exosome to mRNAs. When MV-4-11 cell extracts were immunodepleted of AUF1, the rate of decay of ARE(bcl-2) transcripts was reduced, indicating that nucleolin and AUF1 have opposing roles in bcl-2 mRNA turnover. When the function of nucleolin in MV-4-11 cells was impaired by treatment with the nucleolin-targeting aptamer AS1411, association of AUF1 with bcl-2 mRNA was increased. This suggests that the degradation of bcl-2 mRNA induced by AS1411 results from both interference with nucleolin protection of bcl-2 mRNA and recruitment of the exosome by AUF1. Based on our findings, we propose a model that illustrates the opposing roles of nucleolin and AUF1 in regulating bcl-2 mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2170527087,"Mechanical disuse will bias bone marrow stromal cells towards adipogenesis, ultimately compromising the regenerative capacity of the stem cell pool and impeding the rapid and full recovery of bone morphology. Here, it was tested whether brief daily exposure to high-frequency, low-magnitude vibrations can preserve the marrow environment during disuse and enhance the initiation of tissue recovery upon reambulation. Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to hindlimb unloading (HU, n = 24), HU interrupted by weight-bearing for 15 min/d (HU+SHAM, n = 24), HU interrupted by low-level whole body vibrations (0.2 g, 90 Hz) for 15 min/d (HU+VIB, n = 24), or served as age-matched controls (AC, n = 24). Following 3 w of disuse, half of the mice in each group were released for 3 w of reambulation (RA), while the others were sacrificed. RA+VIB mice continued to receive vibrations for 15 min/d while RA+SHAM continued to receive sham loading. After disuse, HU+VIB mice had a 30% greater osteogenic marrow stromal cell population, 30% smaller osteoclast surface, 76% greater osteoblast surface but similar trabecular bone volume fraction compared to HU. After 3 w of reambulation, trabecular bone of RA+VIB mice had a 30% greater bone volume fraction, 51% greater marrow osteoprogenitor population, 83% greater osteoblast surfaces, 59% greater bone formation rates, and a 235% greater ratio of bone lining osteoblasts to marrow adipocytes than RA mice. A subsequent experiment indicated that receiving the mechanical intervention only during disuse, rather than only during reambulation, was more effective in altering trabecular morphology. These data indicate that the osteogenic potential of bone marrow cells is retained by low-magnitude vibrations during disuse, an attribute which may have contributed to an enhanced recovery of bone morphology during reambulation."
https://openalex.org/W2095613974,"In lipid bilayers, cholesterol facilitates the formation of the liquid-ordered phase and enables the formation of laterally ordered structures such as lipid rafts. While these domains have an important role in a variety of cellular processes, the precise atomic-level mechanisms responsible for cholesterol's specific ordering and packing capability have remained unresolved.Our atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this ordering and the associated packing effects in membranes largely result from cholesterol's molecular structure, which differentiates cholesterol from other sterols. We find that cholesterol molecules prefer to be located in the second coordination shell, avoiding direct cholesterol-cholesterol contacts, and form a three-fold symmetric arrangement with proximal cholesterol molecules. At larger distances, the lateral three-fold organization is broken by thermal fluctuations. For other sterols having less structural asymmetry, the three-fold arrangement is considerably lost.We conclude that cholesterol molecules act collectively in lipid membranes. This is the main reason why the liquid-ordered phase only emerges for Chol concentrations well above 10 mol% where the collective self-organization of Chol molecules emerges spontaneously. The collective ordering process requires specific molecular-scale features that explain why different sterols have very different membrane ordering properties: the three-fold symmetry in the Chol-Chol organization arises from the cholesterol off-plane methyl groups allowing the identification of raft-promoting sterols from those that do not promote rafts."
https://openalex.org/W2138454161,"Oral cancer survival rates increase significantly when it is detected and treated early. Unfortunately, clinicians now lack tests which easily and reliably distinguish pre-malignant oral lesions from those already transitioned to malignancy. A test for proteins, ones found in non-invasively-collected whole saliva and whose abundances distinguish these lesion types, would meet this critical need.To discover such proteins, in a first-of-its-kind study we used advanced mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics analysis of the pooled soluble fraction of whole saliva from four subjects with pre-malignant lesions and four with malignant lesions. We prioritized candidate biomarkers via bioinformatics and validated selected proteins by western blotting. Bioinformatic analysis of differentially abundant proteins and initial western blotting revealed increased abundance of myosin and actin in patients with malignant lesions. We validated those results by additional western blotting of individual whole saliva samples from twelve other subjects with pre-malignant oral lesions and twelve with malignant oral lesions. Sensitivity/specificity values for distinguishing between different lesion types were 100%/75% (p = 0.002) for actin, and 67%/83% (p<0.00001) for myosin in soluble saliva. Exfoliated epithelial cells from subjects' saliva also showed increased myosin and actin abundance in those with malignant lesions, linking our observations in soluble saliva to abundance differences between pre-malignant and malignant cells.Salivary actin and myosin abundances distinguish oral lesion types with sensitivity and specificity rivaling other non-invasive oral cancer tests. Our findings provide a promising starting point for the development of non-invasive and inexpensive salivary tests to reliably detect oral cancer early."
https://openalex.org/W2100879756,"Fibrous aggregates of Tau protein are characteristic features of Alzheimer disease. We applied high resolution atomic force and EM microscopy to study fibrils assembled from different human Tau isoforms and domains. All fibrils reveal structural polymorphism; the “thin twisted” and “thin smooth” fibrils resemble flat ribbons (cross-section ∼10 × 15 nm) with diverse twist periodicities. “Thick fibrils” show periodicities of ∼65–70 nm and thicknesses of ∼9–18 nm such as routinely reported for “paired helical filaments” but structurally resemble heavily twisted ribbons. Therefore, thin and thick fibrils assembled from different human Tau isoforms challenge current structural models of paired helical filaments. Furthermore, all Tau fibrils reveal axial subperiodicities of ∼17–19 nm and, upon exposure to mechanical stress or hydrophobic surfaces, disassemble into uniform fragments that remain connected by thin thread-like structures (∼2 nm). This hydrophobically induced disassembly is inhibited at enhanced electrolyte concentrations, indicating that the fragments resemble structural building blocks and the fibril integrity depends largely on hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Because full-length Tau and repeat domain constructs assemble into fibrils of similar thickness, the “fuzzy coat” of Tau protein termini surrounding the fibril axis is nearly invisible for atomic force microscopy and EM, presumably because of its high flexibility.

When incubated in a medium with high concentration of basic fibroblastic growth factor (FGF2), 100 ng/ml of human recombinant BMPs induced morphological changes and differentiation of hES cells in 24 to 48 hours. After 5 days, expression of differentiation markers was induced and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and flow cytometry. BMP-2/6 exhibited stronger activity for the induction of the expression of trophectodermal (CDX2) and endodermal (SOX17, GATA4, AFP) markers than BMP-2 or BMP-6 homodimers. BMP-2/6 also induced the expression of BMPR2 gene more effectively than BMP-2 or BMP-6 when used at the same concentration and time. Moreover, the percentage of cells expressing the surface endodermal marker CXCR4 was also increased for the heterodimer when compared to both homodimers. BMP-2/6 was a more potent activator of Smad-dependent (SMAD1/5) and Smad-independent signaling (mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and p38) than BMP-2 and BMP-6, and the activation of these pathways might play a role in its increased potency for inducing hES cell differentiation.Therefore, we conclude that BMP-2/6 is more potent than BMP-2 or BMP-6 for inducing differentiation of hES cells, and it can be used as a more powerful substitute of these BMPs in in vitro differentiation guidance."

Although the pharmaceutical industry has embraced stem cells as tools in drug discovery, few companies have taken the risk to deliver stem cell-based medicines.

Although the pharmaceutical industry has embraced stem cells as tools in drug discovery, few companies have taken the risk to deliver stem cell-based medicines. Here, we evaluate the various cell-based opportunities and corporate strategies. Recently, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have taken an increased interest in stem cell biology. The use of stem cells as research tools has expanded with most of the major pharmaceutical companies using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or adult stem cells for internal drug discovery programs. These internal efforts are often enhanced through the expertise of external partnerships with academics or biotech companies. The specific use of stem cell-based tools in conventional drug discovery programs are varied but based on the reproducibility of deriving clinically relevant cell types as diverse as sensory neurons, cardiac myocytes, and pancreatic progenitors. Here, rather than focus on the extensive application of the technology as tools for drug discovery, we will discuss the emerging opportunities for biopharmaceutical companies to engage in stem cell-based regenerative medicine. In some instances, the approach will apply the pharmaceutical strength in the research and development of small or large molecules projects to find novel therapeutics that modify endogenous stem/progenitor cell fate. For example, discovery programs that stimulate the endogenous activation of cardiac progenitors for congestive heart failure (CHF) or myocardial infarction (MI) (Wu et al., 2004Wu X. Ding S. Ding Q. Gray N.S. Schultz P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1590-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), expansion of pancreatic islet precursor cells for diabetes (Chen et al., 2009Chen S. Borowiak M. Fox J.L. Maehr R. Osafune K. Davidow L. Lam K. Peng L.F. Schreiber S.L. Rubin L.L. Melton D. Nat. Chem.

Calandra G. Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010; (in press)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.12.538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In other cases, autologous or allogeneic adult stem cells are used to induce the body's endogenous regeneration processes in diseased tissue (e.g., ischemia), typically via the action of paracrine factors. Finally, the ultimate promise of stem cell biology is cell/tissue replacement therapy. Cell replacement therapies are anticipated because of the fact that stem cell derivatives may accurately recapitulate the normal biology of cells or tissues and restore function in degenerative diseases. Therefore, we expect that stem cell-based therapeutic approaches will become of particular relevance as pharmaceutical companies seek opportunities in disease modification and away from a focus on purely palliative treatment. As pharmaceutical companies have been working for years with global regulatory agencies and clinical centers to create strong partnerships, this experience is a key strength that the pharmaceutical industry will bring to the Regenerative Medicine space. In this discussion, we have focused on large pharmaceutical companies, (Table 1, note that this analysis is limited to publicly disclosed information), although opportunities for biotech companies could be stronger in autologous cell-based therapies.Table 1Timeline of Large Pharma Activity in Regenerative MedicineDrug Modifiers of Stem CellsAutologous Adult Stem CellsAllogenic Adult Stem CellsESCs/iPSCsCompanyLCEILCEILCEILCPfizer01/09: ViaCyte (Diabetes)06/08: Eyecyte (eye)12/09: Athersys (IBD)04/09: UCL (eye)Novartis03/09: Epistem 11/09: HSCI (CNS)11/09: Cellerix (GI)08/09: Opexa (MS)11/06: ESCs (CNS)Roche06/09: I-STEM (CNS)11/09: Cellerix (GI)Sanofi Aventis04/10: CureDM (Diabetes)Johnson & Johnson08/05: Tengion (Bladders)07/02: Neuronyx 06/06: Viacell (CV)04/07: ViaCyte (Diabetes)Amgen08/03: Viacell (Cord blood bank)Novo Nordisk07/08: Allocure (AKI)10/08: Cellartis (Diabetes)Teva (Generics Company)12/09: MGVS (PVD)07/05: Proneuron (SCI)02/05: Gamidacell (Transplant)09/07: CellCure (eye)06/07: Technion (ESC)Medtronic (Device Company)04/08: Scil (Dental)11/07: Arteriocyte (Ischemia)Smith & Nephew (Device Company)10/07: REMEDI (Orthopedic)Abbreviations are as follows: EI, date of equity investment made in company; LC, date of collaboration or licensing deal made with company; AKI, acute kidney injury; CNS, central nervous system; CV, cardiovascular; GI, gastrointestinal; HSCI, Harvard Stem Cell Institute; IBD, inflammatory bowel disease; MGVA, multigene vascular systems; MS, multiple sclerosis; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; SCI, spinal cord injury; UCL, University College London.

Since the earliest protocols using murine ESCs for in vitro differentiation experiments, it was established that small molecules, such as retinoic acid and 5-azacytidine, could be used to direct and modify stem cell fate. The interest in developing drug screens for human ESC differentiation has heightened with better understanding of developmental pathways and the identification of specific molecules to improve cell differentiation (reviewed in Ding and Schultz, 2004Ding S. Schultz P.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This finding raises the distinct possibility that small and large molecule (e.g., antibodies, nucleotides, proteins) modifiers will also be identified that can enhance endogenous cell and tissue regeneration. As this research paradigm is the strength of biopharmaceutical companies, a commitment to regenerative medicine based on combining drug discovery and stem cell platforms is taking hold across the industry, through internal growth or external partnerships (Trounson et al., 2010Trounson A. Baum E. Gibbons D. Tekamp-Olson P. Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 6 (this issue): 513-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, this issue). These new drug discovery opportunities could be applied as stand-alone treatments that induce cell fate (e.g., Erythropoietin) or combined with existing or emerging stem cell-based therapies. Furthermore, the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has created an important new opportunity for human pluripotent stem cells carrying specific genetic variants, mutations, and patient specific cell lines to be used in drug discovery and personalized regenerative medicine. (reviewed in Rowntree and McNeish, 2010Rowntree R. McNeish J. Regen. Med. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of using stem cells as therapeutics, 68 cell-based approaches are listed under clinical development in a commercial pipeline database. Of these listings, over 90% are company sponsored, with the only large biopharmaceutical companies listed being Teva, Baxter, and Genzyme (Table 2). However, when current/completed clinical studies in four therapeutic areas are evaluated, less than 20% are company sponsored (and only three are large company sponsored), whereas a large number are investigator initiated studies (Table 2). Pharma's involvement may be obscured when there is an equity stake in the small company or if a company sponsors an academic to run the study. Nonetheless, this trend begs the question: why is the pharmaceutical industry hesitant to explore cell-based therapy? Significant factors may include the following: insufficient demonstration of efficacy, regulatory, and safety concerns; a belief that cell therapies will not offer substantial benefit over existing therapies or demonstrate uptake by patients; and lack of familiarity with both the business model for commercializing cell-based products and the complexity of developing a product. Therefore, to date, few large pharmaceutical companies are actively conducting clinical trials given the challenges outlined above. For pharmaceutical companies to move into the commercialization of cellular regenerative medicine products, a “tipping point” needs to be reached, and the barriers facing this industry will be dependent on the type of cell-based approach under development.Table 2Current Pipeline of Cell-Based Therapies in DevelopmentClinical PhaseaADIS Insight database search using cell replacement therapy as the search parameter with Phase I/II trials put in Phase I bucket and Phase II/III trials placed in Phase II bucket.Cell-Based TherapiesCompany-Sponsored TherapiesProportion of Company-Sponsored Therapies (%)Large Company-Sponsored TherapiesPhase I3835920Phase II2422923 (Teva, Baxter, Genzyme)Phase III65830Total6862913 (5%)Disease-Specific ViewbFrom clinicaltrials.gov.

Open table in a new tab Of the existing clinical trials using stem cells (Table 2), the majority have relied and continue to rely on autologous cells, for example, the patients' own bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This therapeutic approach typically focuses on cellular induction of immune modulation or tissue regeneration rather than cell replacement and is, therefore, amenable to investigator-sponsored studies given the low cost and minimal technical capabilities required for the trials. One area of active research has been the application of autologous human MSCs for acute myocardial infarction, where cells are delivered directly to the ischemic cardiac tissue. Numerous trial designs have resulted in hundreds of patients being treated to date. The meta-analysis from collective clinical data suggest MSCs show a modest, yet significant, improvement in functional markers, such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), with reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume and lesion area (reviewed in Abdel-Latif et al., 2007Abdel-Latif A. Bolli R. Tleyjeh I.M. Montori V.M. Perin E.C. Hornung C.A. Zuba-Surma E.K. Al-Mallah M. Dawn M. Arch. Intern. Med. 2007; 167: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, Martin-Rendon et al., 2008Martin-Rendon E. Brunskill S.J. Hyde C.J. Stanworth S.J. Mathur A. Watt S.M. Eur. Heart J. 2008; 29: 1807-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data suggest that autologous stem cell therapy in cardiac disease results in improved cardiac functioning outcomes. However, the field will need more adequately powered, randomized trials to demonstrate clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality benefit) and extended clinical assessments of patient outcomes in order to become a standard of care. As autologous stem cell therapy becomes a reliable treatment in ischemic, inflammatory, or autoimmune diseases, biopharmaceutical companies will evaluate business models to determine the commercial opportunity associated with investment. In health economic terms, autologous cell-based therapies can be cost effective. For example, a recent analysis of stem cell-derived bladder replacement in the UK demonstrated a cost benefit of £36,000 over existing therapies. Creating therapies for each individual is a very different business from pharma's normal operating model, in that each patient becomes a lot of 1 and entails significant logistical challenges (Smith, 2009Smith D.M. The World Stem Cell Report 2009.in: Siegal B. Genetics Policy Institute, 2009: 131-137Google Scholar). Companies considering this opportunity will need to evaluate if there are sufficient patients requiring one cell replacement to develop a scaleable process. Two feasible commercial approaches to autologous cell therapy have been taken: a centralized and distributed model. Tigenix have developed a centralized cell production approach for ChondroCelect, an approved therapy for cartilage repair in Europe. A centralized model requires patients to travel to a specialized center for treatment. An alternative is the distributed model, in which cells are removed from patients and isolated locally by means of a device before being reintroduced to the patient. In this model, patients are treated on site and are not required to travel to a specific dedicated center for treatment. The Cytori Celution device allows bedside isolation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells derived from adipose tissue following liposuction. These cells are then available for readministration to patients for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery in Europe and Asia. Cytori's autologous MSCs are also in clinical trials for autologous treatment of acute and chronic heart disease. This organization recently partnered with GE Healthcare for the distribution of the Celution devices and commercialization of stem cell banking and research markets. Even if a significant proportion of the registered autologous stem cell clinical trials underway/completed show efficacy, several hurdles must be overcome to bring this approach into pharma's commercial sphere. Closed-loop devices (sterile, transportable, single-use production units) that simplify cell isolation and expansion and preclude using costly GMP facilities may be necessary. Evidence that efficacy and/or safety profiles are superior to existing traditional small molecule or biologic therapies will be required to justify the likely high cost of goods and the subsequent selling price. Regulatory oversight will depend on the level of manipulation (e.g., drug treatment, expansion, etc.) of the autologous cells. Nevertheless, recognition that future opportunities exist in this area is evidenced by licensing and investment by biopharmaceutical companies (Table 1). Human adult and umbilical/placental-derived stem cell sources are being developed as allogeneic cell-based therapies. Current allogeneic stem cell-based approaches are not typically designed to engraft and rely on a variety of mechanisms to deliver efficacy, including secretion of paracrine factors prior to immune destruction. Therefore, the mechanism of action is not dissimilar to autologous approaches. There are, however, data that suggest that human MSCs may not illicit an allogeneic immune response when delivered therapeutically (Klyushnenkova et al., 2005Klyushnenkova E. Mosca J.D. Zernetkina V. Majumdar M.K. Beggs K.J. Simonetti D.W. Deans R.J. Mcintosh K.R. J. Biomed. Sci. 2005; 12: 47-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Therefore, the potential exists to treat thousands of patients with expanded adult stem cells from a single donor. True replacement and integration using allogeneic cells will require re-education of the host's immune system, some type of immune suppression treatment, or HLA matching prior to treatment. Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy can be done today but is not a preferred option, while the other options do not seem likely in the short term. A robust understanding of the therapeutic areas where adult progenitor cells have clinical efficacy is likely to emerge over the next few years. The majority of studies being pursued in the clinical trials database use mesenchymal stem cells or multipotent adult progenitors for treatment of immune disorders, given their anti-inflammatory and immune-modifying properties (reviewed in Uccelli et al., 2008Uccelli A. Moretta L. Pistoia V. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Although adult stem cell approaches have been documented as safe thus far, further studies using human adult stem cells will be required to demonstrate efficacy in immune or inflammatory conditions. While promising data has been reported (albeit only in press releases) by Osiris/Genzyme for multiple indications, including GvHD, this and other partnerships (e.g., Pfizer/Athersys in inflammatory bowel disease) will help define the opportunity for adult allogeneic cell therapy. In terms of stimulating wound repair and treating critical limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, as with autologous cell trials, modest benefits have already been observed, and many others studies have yet to conclude. As a business model, allogeneic cell sources are more aligned with the pharmaceutical business practice of centralized product production and distribution to health care providers. However, for pharma to aggressively adopt allogeneic adult cell therapy, multiple issues will need to be addressed, including cell expansion and manufacturing, product consistency, product delivery to the patient, and successful well-designed, well-controlled clinical trials showing significant benefits over standard of care. Given that cell-based therapies are already available (e.g., Apligraf from Organogenesis), this set of challenges is not insurmountable but will require additional investment to minimize the cost of making the cell therapy and providing it routinely at the point of care. Direct involvement from pharma in human ESC therapy has been modest. Concerns regarding the use of a human ESCs notwithstanding, there are advantages of using pluripotent stem cells as source material for therapy because all cell types are theoretically possible for expansion and use in cell replacement therapies. Examples include the encapsulated beta-cells for treatment of type 1 diabetes as proposed by ViaCyte (formerly Novocell) and supported by J&J's equity stake, Geron's oligodendrocyte therapy for spinal cord injury, and Pfizer's collaboration with University College London to produce retinal pigment epithelium for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration. Concerns around safety, anticipated regulatory complexity, and lack of experience in this new area of research may be significant barriers to entry. While iPSCs may remove ethical concerns, the safety and regulatory hurdles remain undiminished and may even be greater. Much research needs to be done to show that the myriad of ways of generating iPSCs do everything that the gold standard of hESCs do—and no more—but the data have thus far been mixed (Rowntree and McNeish, 2010Rowntree R. McNeish J. Regen. Med. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Commercially, any approach can be viable if two major hurdles are overcome: overall cost of the product and significant patient-benefits. As payers implement more rigorous health economic analysis in decision-making, truly restorative or disease-modifying therapies will offer greater value and subsequent reimbursement value over palliative ones. Cell-based therapies move us toward this goal, although currently launched products (e.g., Dermatology and Orthopaedic focused) have been limited commercially due to their inability to show significant efficacy benefits over standard of care, particularly as related to the costs of cell-based therapies relative to the cost of standard of care. pharma is moving gradually into stem cells, first using tools for traditional drug discovery, enhanced by the greater availability of cell types through iPSC technology. The opportunity to generate novel molecules that modify endogenous stem cells is very much in scope and will likely lead to new therapeutic approaches using small molecules and biologics to enhance the body's natural repair mechanisms. These are near-term options and need little change in the way that pharmaceutical industry works today. The move to true cell-based therapeutics by pharma is still modest. Some companies have preferred to take equity stake in active biotech companies while others are adopting a “watchful waiting” approach until the myriad of clinical trials currently underway read out definitively one way or another before actively investing in the space. As there are hundreds of regenerative medicine-focused biotechnology companies globally, it is expected that partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies will develop following the demonstration of clinically safe and efficacious approaches. Pfizer and Teva have taken a much more proactive “partner and learn” approach, and it is highly likely that some companies may have stealth efforts that are not yet visible in the public domain. We still do not know whether regenerative medicine will provide niche benefit or will revolutionise healthcare. If the latter, pharma needs to be prepared for investment and change. Should significant benefit be demonstrated by stem cell-based medicine, one must anticipate a flurry of acquisitions and partnering deals to make way for the future."
https://openalex.org/W2025902790,"Various approaches have been used to investigate how properties of farm contact networks impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. The potential for transmission of an infection through a contact network can be evaluated in terms of the basic reproduction number, R(0). The magnitude of R(0) is related to the mean contact rate of a host, in this case a farm, and is further influenced by heterogeneities in contact rates of individual hosts. The latter can be evaluated as the second order moments of the contact matrix (variances in contact rates, and co-variance between contacts to and from individual hosts). Here we calculate these quantities for the farms in a country-wide livestock network: >15,000 Scottish sheep farms in each of 4 years from July 2003 to June 2007. The analysis is relevant to endemic and chronic infections with prolonged periods of infectivity of affected animals, and uses different weightings of contacts to address disease scenarios of low, intermediate and high animal-level prevalence.Analysis of networks of Scottish farms via sheep movements from July 2003 to June 2007 suggests that heterogeneities in movement patterns (variances and covariances of rates of movement on and off the farms) make a substantial contribution to the potential for the transmission of infectious diseases, quantified as R(0), within the farm population. A small percentage of farms (<20%) contribute the bulk of the transmission potential (>80%) and these farms could be efficiently targeted by interventions aimed at reducing spread of diseases via animal movement."
https://openalex.org/W2117633202,"Background OXR1 is an ancient gene, present in all eukaryotes examined so far that confers protection from oxidative stress by an unknown mechanism. The most highly conserved region of the gene is the carboxyl-terminal TLDc domain, which has been shown to be sufficient to prevent oxidative damage. Methodology/Principal Findings OXR1 has a complex genomic structure in the mosquito A. gambiae, and we confirm that multiple splice forms are expressed in adult females. Our studies revealed that OXR1 regulates the basal levels of catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) expression, two enzymes involved in detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, giving new insight into the mechanism of action of OXR1. Gene silencing experiments indicate that the Jun Kinase (JNK) gene acts upstream of OXR1 and also regulates expression of CAT and GPx. Both OXR1 and JNK genes are required for adult female mosquitoes to survive chronic oxidative stress. OXR1 silencing decreases P. berghei oocyst formation. Unexpectedly, JNK silencing has the opposite effect and enhances Plasmodium infection in the mosquito, suggesting that JNK may also mediate some, yet to be defined, antiparasitic response. Conclusion The JNK pathway regulates OXR1 expression and OXR1, in turn, regulates expression of enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Anopheles gambiae. OXR1 silencing decreases Plasmodium infection in the mosquito, while JNK silencing has the opposite effect and enhances infection."

G-protein receptor-coupled agonists such as thrombin, signal changes the structure of proteoglycans produced by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). One component of classical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling invokes transactivation of protein tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor. Serine/threonine receptor growth factors such as transforming growth factor-(TGF)-β are potent activators of proteoglycan synthesis. We have used the model of proteoglycan synthesis to demonstrate that the signaling paradigm of GPCR signaling can be extended to include the transactivation of serine/threonine receptor, specifically the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) also known as activin-like kinase (ALK) V. Thrombin stimulated elongation of GAG chains and increased proteoglycan core protein expression and these responses were blocked by the TβRI antagonist, SB431542 and TβRI siRNA knockdown, as well as several protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 antagonists. The canonical downstream response to TGF-β is increased C-terminal phosphorylation of the transcription factor Smad2 generating phospho-Smad2C (phosphorylation of Smad2 C-terminal region).

Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19066) Google Scholar). Proteoglycan synthesis and structure is regulated by vasoactive growth factors, and consequently, their receptors and signaling pathways are potential therapeutic targets (5Ballinger M.L. Nigro J.

Health Risk Manag. 2007; 3: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar).G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane receptors and are present on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) where they signal important actions such as vascular contraction, cellular migration and proliferation, and secretion (7Smith N.J. Luttrell L.M. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GPCR agonists include key vasoactive molecules associated with physiology and pathophysiology, including thrombin, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II (9Lefkowitz R.J. Acta Physiol. 2007; 190: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The current paradigm of GPCR signaling covers three major pathways; first, the classic pathway in which ligand engagement causes G-protein binding to the receptor and Gα complexes then regulate the activity of downstream effector molecules (10McCudden C.R. Hains M.D. Kimple R.J. Siderovski D.P. Willard F.S. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar); second, β-arrestin signaling via ligand-regulated scaffolds (11Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar); and third, as first described by Ullrich in 1996 (12Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar), GPCR agonists through their receptors can transactivate a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), such as the EGF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, leading to both Ras-dependent MAPK activation and stimulation of PI3K (13Gavi S.

Res. 2008; 123: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thrombin has the unique mechanism of receptor activation in that it cleaves the extracellular domain of its GPCR to liberate a tethered ligand that activates the receptor (19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar).We have reported recently that thrombin stimulates proteoglycan synthesis by VSMCs (18Ivey M.E. Little P.J. Thromb. Res. 2008; 123: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and stimulation is associated with an increase in the length of biglycan GAG chains (18Ivey M.E. Little P.J. Thromb. Res. 2008; 123: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The effects of thrombin on proteoglycan synthesis are completely blocked by the PAR-1 antagonist, JNJ5177094 and are not observed for a catalytically inactive thrombin mimetic, indicating that signaling occurs via the PAR-1 (18Ivey M.E.

The actions of thrombin on proteoglycan synthesis were also partially (∼40%) mediated via transactivation of the tyrosine kinase EGF receptor (18Ivey M.E. Little P.J. Thromb.

We have previously reported on the potent activity of TGF-β to cause GAG elongation in VSMCs via its serine/threonine kinase receptor, TGF-β type I receptor/activin-like kinase V (TβRI/ALK V) and its downstream canonical carboxyl-terminal Smad phosphorylation pathway (20Little P.J.

Little P.J. Thromb. Res. 2008; 123: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and notwithstanding that the current transactivation signaling paradigm is limited to tyrosine kinase receptors (22Saito Y. Berk B.C. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 3-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we considered and evaluated whether or not the effect of thrombin mediated via PAR-1, might involve transactivation of TβRI/ALK V.RESULTSThe small molecule inhibitor, SB431542, is a well characterized antagonist of serine/threonine kinase activity of the TβRI (25Mori Y. Ishida W. Bhattacharyya S. Li Y. Platanias L.C. Varga J. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Ungefroren H. Groth S. Ruhnke M. Kalthoff H. Fändrich F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2644-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SB431542 inhibits the action of TGF-β on VSMC proteoglycan synthesis (21Dadlani H. Ballinger M.L. Osman N. Getachew R. Little P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7844-7852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and we used it as a tool to investigate the role of TβRI in mediating the effects of thrombin on proteoglycan synthesis in human VSMCs. Radiosulfate incorporation into secreted proteoglycans is used as a measure of proteoglycan synthesis, and it represents the sum of increased proteoglycan core protein synthesis (and hence more GAG initiation sites), elongation of the GAG chains and increased sulfation of the GAG chains (5Ballinger M.L. Nigro J. Frontanilla K.V. Dart A.M. Little P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thrombin treatment of confluent serum-deprived VSMCs caused a 2.5-fold increase in [35S]sulfate incorporation, and this was blocked (partially) in a concentration-dependent manner by SB431542 (0.1–3 μm) (Fig. 1a). Inhibition was apparent at very low concentrations (0.1 μm) of SB431542 consistent with the specificity of action being limited to the proposed target. SB431542 blocked almost 50% of the response to thrombin with an IC50 of ∼250 nm. siRNA knockdown of the TβRI/ALKV (100 nm) also totally inhibited TGF-β, but importantly, thrombin mediated radiosulfate incorporation (Fig. 1c). We have demonstrated previously that the size of the GAG chains from thrombin-treated cells is increased when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by the gold standard technique of size exclusion chromatography of the free GAG chains chemically released from the core proteins (18Ivey M.E. Little P.J. Thromb. Res. 2008; 123: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the action of thrombin extends to the synthesis of short GAG chains on exogenous xyloside and is therefore occurring at the level of the synthesis of the GAG chains in the Golgi apparatus (18Ivey M.E. Little P.J. Thromb. Res. 2008; 123: 288-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We analyzed the size of the proteoglycans secreted by the cells as shown in Fig. 1a by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1b). Thrombin treatment increased the size of the major secreted proteoglycan, the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, biglycan, and this was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by SB431542 (Fig. 1b). The increase in size of biglycan by thrombin also was inhibited partially by siRNA knockdown of the TβRI/ALKV (Fig. 4d). The size of the core protein does not change, and we have previously demonstrated for multiple agonists that the change in size of the proteoglycan is due to a change in size of the GAG chains (18Ivey M.E.

Nigro J. Frontanilla K.V. Dart A.M. Little P.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The synthesis of proteoglycan core proteins can be quantitated by providing the cells with a radiolabeled amino acid (35S-Met/Cys) and determining secreted levels of radioactivity by the cetyl pyridinium chloride precipitation method, which is specific for the identification of proteoglycans (27Wasteson A. Uthne K. Westermark B. Biochem. J. 1973; 136: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Treatment of VSMCs with thrombin and TGF-β each resulted in an ∼30% increase in secreted proteoglycan core proteins over 24 h (Fig. 1e). The stimulation by thrombin was completely blocked by the PAR-1 antagonist JNJ5177094 and partially (∼50%) blocked by the TβRI/ALK V antagonist SB431542. The response to TGF-β was completely blocked by SB431542 (Fig. 1e). These data indicate that the stimulation of proteoglycan core protein synthesis and secretion by thrombin involves PAR-1 and TβRI/ALK V.We reported previously (21Dadlani H. Ballinger M.L. Osman N. Getachew R. Little P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7844-7852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that the effect of PDGF on radiosulfate incorporation into secreted proteoglycans and GAG elongation in VSMCs was blocked by SB431542 (21Dadlani H. Ballinger M.L. Osman N. Getachew R. Little P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7844-7852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in that case, we utilized a pan-TGF-β antibody to immunoneutralize any released TGF-β and demonstrated that the effect of PDGF was due to the release and subsequent auto/paracrine action of TGF-β (21Dadlani H. Ballinger M.L. Osman N. Getachew R. Little P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7844-7852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thrombin can release TGF-β from the pericellular matrix (28Taipale J. Koli K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25378-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar mechanism applied to the action of thrombin on biglycan synthesis and secretion by human VSMCs, we utilized the pan-TGF-β antibody immunoneutralization strategy in VSMCs treated with thrombin (Fig. 1f). The pan TGF-β-neutralizing antibody greatly attenuated the effect of exogenously added TGF-β, but it did not inhibit the action of thrombin to stimulate radiosulfate incorporation into these cells (Fig. 1f). Furthermore, when TGF-β actions were inhibited by SB431542, there was no further inhibition apparent in the presence of high concentrations of the anti TGF-β antibody (Fig. 1f). We further examined the effect of thrombin on the size of biglycan molecules as assessed by SDS-PAGE, and again, the effect of thrombin was not attenuated in the presence of an immunoblocking concentration of a pan-TGF-β antibody (data not shown). Thus, either VSMCs are not releasing TGF-β or if they are synthesizing and releasing TGF-β or TGF-β is being released from storage sites in the matrix, then the amount that is released is insufficient to have an auto-paracrine action on the cells to activate TβRI/ALK V receptors and affect proteoglycan synthesis. It is noteworthy that although TGF-β is released from the pericellular matrix the majority is in the inactive latent, rather than biologically active patent form (28Taipale J. Koli K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25378-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Thrombin is a trypsin-like serine protease, which extremely rapidly activates PAR-1 by binding to and cleaving the amino-terminal exodomain of the PAR-1 at the Arg-41/Ser-42 peptide bond to unmask a new receptor amino terminus and unveils a tethered peptide ligand, containing the hexapeptide recognition sequence, SFLLRN, which activates the receptor (19Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). Peptide mimetics have been developed, which can activate the PAR-1 receptor but do not possess protease activity (29Coughlin S.R. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), giving the opportunity to study the effect of PAR-1 activation in the absence of the potentially confounding protease activity of thrombin. TRAP, the hexapeptide amine SFLLRN, treatment of VSMCs for 24 h lead to increased [35S]sulfate into secreted proteoglycans (Fig. 2a). The effect of TRAP was blocked by the PAR-1 antagonist JNJ5177094, and it was also blocked by SB431542 (Fig. 2a). Further analysis demonstrated that treatment of cells with TRAP leads to the synthesis of biglycan molecules that are of increased molecular size (Fig. 2b, lane 4 versus 1). Thus, the [35S]sulfate incorporation (Fig. 2a) and GAG elongation effect (Fig. 2b) of TRAP is blocked by SB431542. SB431542 and JNJ5177094 had a small effect on basal sulfate incorporation (Fig. 2a) but a minimal effect on biglycan size (Fig. 2b). These data strongly suggest that the effect of thrombin on proteoglycan synthesis, secretion, and GAG hyperelongation was mediated via PAR-1 and was not due to the proteolytic activity of thrombin releasing or activating TGF-β from the extracellular matrix.FIGURE 2A thrombin-mimetic, TRAP-mediated proteoglycan synthesis is blocked by inhibition of ALK V. VSMCs were treated with SB431542 (3 μm) or JNJ5177094 (10 μm) in the presence of TRAP (500 μm) and [35S]SO4 (50 μCi/ml) for 24 h. a, radiolabeled incorporation was assessed as described in Fig. 1A. Results are the mean ± S.E. of data normalized to control from three separate experiments in triplicate. **, p < 0.01 versus TRAP alone and ##, p < 0.01 versus control using a one-way ANOVA. b, complete proteoglycans were isolated and separated over SDS-PAGE (4–13% acrylamide gradient) as described in Fig. 1b.

Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4197) Google Scholar). The exact consequences depend upon the cell type and context (30Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4197) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously and reported that TGF-β activates proteoglycan synthesis in VSMCs via a mechanism involving TβRI and phosphorylation of Smad2 (21Dadlani H. Ballinger M.L. Osman N. Getachew R. Little P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7844-7852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, we evaluated the temporal effects of thrombin treatment of VSMCs on the level of phospho-Smad2C (Fig. 3a). Assessed over a 24-h period, we observed an increase in the level of phospho-Smad2C at 1–2 h and a slowly increasing level of phospho-Smad2C out to 24 h. (Fig. 3a). This response is slower than the effect of TGF-β itself on activation of phospho-Smad2C but is consistent with a direct action of the PAR-1 on the TβRI.FIGURE 3Thrombin stimulates Smad2 phosphorylation over 24 h. Thrombin causes nuclear translocation of phospho-Smad2. a, VSMCs were treated with thrombin (10 units/ml) for up to 24 h. VSMCs stimulated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 1 h (TGF-β) were used as a positive control. Cell lysates were collected and proteins (50 μg) were resolved on SDS-PAGE 10% acrylamide gel and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then incubated with anti-Smad2(Ser-465/467) monoclonal antibody (1:1000) followed by peroxidise-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The membrane was then reprobed with unphosphorylated-Smad2 and anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody's (1:1000) followed by peroxidise labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody to determine equal loading. b, VSMCs were treated with thrombin (10 units/ml) for up to 24 h. TGF-β (2 ng/ml) stimulation at 1 h was used as a positive control. Nuclear fractions were collected using cellular disruption and centrifugation and separated (50 ng/ml) by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred and probed as described in a.

Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). To answer this question, we treated serum-deprived human VSMCs with thrombin and TGF-β, isolated a nuclear fraction by cellular disruption and centrifugation, and assessed the levels of phospho-Smad2C by Western blotting. Thrombin elicited an early increase in nuclear levels of phospho-Smad2C (1 h) and subsequently a rise to higher levels at 24 h (Fig. 3b). As a positive control, TGF-β also caused a marked increase of phospho-Smad2C in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3b). These data indicate that the action of thrombin to trans-activate TβRI receptors generates functionally active phospho-Smad2C, which translocates to the nucleus as if it were generated classically from TGF-β activation of TβRI/ALK V.The effect of thrombin to increase phospho-Smad2C levels was blocked by inhibition of PAR-1 using multiple approaches, including blockade with the small molecule inhibitors JNJ5177094 (Fig. 4a), and dose-dependently with SCH79797 (Fig. 4b). In addition, preincubation with a PAR-1-specific antibody, which competitively binds to the tethered ligand region, completely blocked the stimulation of phospho-Smad2C (Fig. 4c). A similar effect is seen when interfering with the thrombin active site using 5× molar excess hirudin (Fig. 4d). Confirming the role of ALK V, SB431542 also completely inhibited the ability of thrombin to stimulate phospho-Smad2C (Fig. 4a). We also evaluated the effect of the thrombin mimetic, TRAP, to activate carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation of Smad2. Treatment of VSMCs with TRAP lead to an increase in cytosolic phospho-Smad2C, and this response was attenuated by SB431542 and JNJ5177094 (Fig. 4a). Thus, we have demonstrated that activation of PAR-1 with either its natural ligand thrombin or a peptide mimetic TRAP leads to increased cytoplasmic levels of the classic TβRI/ALK V receptor product, phospho-Smad2C.Although the data show that thrombin can activate Smad2C phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation is an outcome known only to occur as a downstream response to activation of TβRI/ALK V (30Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4197) Google Scholar), further aspects of the data rely on the specificity of the inhibitors of each of the receptors involved in the transactivation pathway, namely PAR-1 and TβRI/ALK V, so we explored this issue. A classic GPCR response that we have characterized previously in these VSMCs is agonist-mediated activation of phospholipase C leading to the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate yielding diacylglycerol and IP3 (32Neylon C.B. Nickashin A. Little P.J. Tkachuk V.A. Bobik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7295-7302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the effect of SB431542 (0–3 μm) and JNJ5177094, respectively, on thrombin-stimulated IP3 accumulation in human VSMCs (Fig. 5a). Thrombin caused a 3-fold increase in the level of IP3, which was not blocked by the highest concentration of SB431542 but was antagonized completely by JNJ5177094 (Fig. 5a). The fact that the response was sensitive to JNJ5177094 confirmed that it is mediated via PAR-1. Thus, there is no evidence that SB431542 has any direct inhibitory activity toward the thrombin receptor PAR-1. We evaluated the potential inhibitory activity of the thrombin receptor antagonist toward the TβRI by stimulating cells with TGF-β in the presence and absence of SB431542 and JNJ517094 and assessing phospho-Smad2C levels"

TAG and SE are stored in an organelle called lipid particles/droplet. Growth of yeast cells on oleate-supplemented media strongly induced proliferation of lipid particles and specifically the synthesis of TAG, which serve as the major pool for the excess of fatty acids. Surprisingly, SE synthesis was strongly inhibited under these conditions. Here, we show that this effect was not due to decreased expression of ARE2 encoding the major yeast SE synthase at the transcriptional level but to competitive enzymatic inhibition of Are2p by free oleate. Consequently, a triple mutant dga1Δlro1Δare1ΔARE2+ grown on oleate did not form substantial amounts of SE and exhibited a growth phenotype similar to the dga1Δlro1Δare1Δare2Δ quadruple mutant, including lack of lipid particles. Growth of these mutants on oleate was strongly delayed, and cell viability was decreased but rescued by adaptation. In these strains, oleate stress caused morphological changes of intracellular membranes, altered phospholipid composition and formation of an additional lipid class, ethyl esters of fatty acids. In summary, our data showed that exposure to oleate led to disturbed lipid and membrane homeostasis along with liposensitivity of the yeast.

https://openalex.org/W2138047396,"Regulation of stem cells depends on both tissue-specific transcriptional regulators and changes in chromatin organization, yet the coordination of these events in endogenous niches is poorly understood. In the Drosophila testis, local JAK-STAT signaling maintains germline and somatic stem cells (GSCs and cyst progenitor cells, or CPCs) in a single niche. Here we show that epigenetic regulation via the nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF) complex ensures GSC and CPC maintenance by positively regulating JAK-STAT signaling, thereby preventing premature differentiation. Conversely, NURF is not required in early differentiating daughter cells of either lineage. Because three additional ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers (ACF, CHRAC, and dMi-2/NuRD) are dispensable for stem cell maintenance in the testis, epigenetic regulation of stem cells within this niche may rely primarily on NURF. Thus, local signals cooperate with specific chromatin-remodeling complexes in intact niches to coordinately regulate a common set of target genes to prevent premature stem cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2152137803,"We have recently described a novel type of glial cell that is scattered across the inner layers of the avian retina [1]. These cells are stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) to proliferate, migrate distally into the retina, and up-regulate the nestin-related intermediate filament transitin. These changes in glial activity correspond with increased susceptibility of neurons to excitotoxic damage. This novel cell-type has been termed the Non-astrocytic Inner Retinal Glia-like (NIRG) cells. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the retinas of non-avian species contain cells that resemble NIRG cells. We assayed for NIRG cells by probing for the expression of Sox2, Sox9, Nkx2.2, vimentin and nestin. NIRG cells were distinguished from astrocytes by a lack of expression for Glial Fibrilliary Acidic Protein (GFAP). We examined the retinas of adult mice, guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys (Macaca fasicularis). In the mouse retina and optic nerve head, we identified numerous astrocytes that expressed GFAP, S100β, Sox2 and Sox9; however, we found no evidence for NIRG-like cells that were positive for Nkx2.2, nestin, and negative for GFAP. In the guinea pig retina, we did not find astrocytes or NIRG cells in the retina, whereas we identified astrocytes in the optic nerve. In the eyes of dogs and monkeys, we found astrocytes and NIRG-like cells scattered across inner layers of the retina and within the optic nerve. We conclude that NIRG-like cells are present in the retinas of canines and non-human primates, whereas the retinas of mice and guinea pigs do not contain NIRG cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056428844,"TRPM7 is a ubiquitous divalent-selective ion channel with its own kinase domain. Recent studies have shown that suppression of TRPM7 protein expression by RNA interference increases resistance to ischemia-induced neuronal cell death in vivo and in vitro, making the channel a potentially attractive pharmacological target for molecular intervention. Here, we report the identification of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, NDGA, AA861, and MK886, as potent blockers of the TRPM7 channel. Using a cell-based assay, application of these compounds prevented cell rounding caused by overexpression of TRPM7 in HEK-293 cells, whereas inhibitors of 12-lipoxygenase and 15-lipoxygenase did not prevent the change in cell morphology. Application of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors blocked heterologously expressed TRPM7 whole-cell currents without affecting the protein's expression level or its cell surface concentration. All three inhibitors were also effective in blocking the native TRPM7 current in HEK-293 cells. However, two other 5-lipoxygenase specific inhibitors, 5,6-dehydro-arachidonic acid and zileuton, were ineffective in suppressing TRPM7 channel activity. Targeted knockdown of 5-lipoxygenase did not reduce TRPM7 whole-cell currents. In addition, application of 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), the product of 5-lipoxygenase, or 5-HPETE's downstream metabolites, leukotriene B4 and leukotriene D4, did not stimulate TRPM7 channel activity. These data suggested that NDGA, AA861, and MK886 reduced the TRPM7 channel activity independent of their effect on 5-lipoxygenase activity. Application of AA861 and NDGA reduced cell death for cells overexpressing TRPM7 cultured in low extracellular divalent cations. Moreover, treatment of HEK-293 cells with AA861 increased cell resistance to apoptotic stimuli to a level similar to that obtained for cells in which TRPM7 was knocked down by RNA interference. In conclusion, NDGA, AA861, and MK886 are potent blockers of the TRPM7 channel capable of attenuating TRPM7's function during cell stress, making them effective tools for the biophysical characterization and suppression of TRPM7 channel conductance in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2055894204,"Hantaviruses indigenous to the New World are the etiologic agents of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). These viruses induce a strong interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) response in human endothelial cells. African green monkey-derived Vero E6 cells are used to propagate hantaviruses as well as many other viruses. The utility of the Vero E6 cell line for virus production is thought to owe to their lack of genes encoding type I interferons (IFN), rendering them unable to mount an efficient innate immune response to virus infection. Interferon lambda, a more recently characterized type III IFN, is transcriptionally controlled much like the type I IFNs, and activates the innate immune system in a similar manner.We show that Vero E6 cells respond to hantavirus infection by secreting abundant IFNlambda. Three New World hantaviruses were similarly able to induce IFNlambda expression in this cell line. The IFNlambda contained within virus preparations generated with Vero E6 cells independently activates ISGs when used to infect several non-endothelial cell lines, whereas innate immune responses by endothelial cells are specifically due to viral infection. We show further that Sin Nombre virus replicates to high titer in human hepatoma cells (Huh7) without inducing ISGs.Herein we report that Vero E6 cells respond to viral infection with a highly active antiviral response, including secretion of abundant IFNlambda. This cytokine is biologically active, and when contained within viral preparations and presented to human epithelioid cell lines, results in the robust activation of innate immune responses. We also show that both Huh7 and A549 cell lines do not respond to hantavirus infection, confirming that the cytoplasmic RNA helicase pathways possessed by these cells are not involved in hantavirus recognition. We demonstrate that Vero E6 actively respond to virus infection and inhibiting IFNlambda production in these cells might increase their utility for virus propagation."

https://openalex.org/W2044341589,"Background Chromosomal fragile sites are heritable specific loci especially prone to breakage. Some of them are associated with human genetic disorders and several studies have demonstrated their importance in genome instability in cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs responsible of post-transcriptional gene regulation and their involvement in several diseases such as cancer has been widely demonstrated. The altered expression of miRNAs is sometimes due to chromosomal rearrangements and epigenetic events, thus it is essential to study miRNAs in the context of their genomic locations, in order to find significant correlations between their aberrant expression and the phenotype. Principal Findings Here we use statistical models to study the incidence of human miRNA genes on fragile sites and their association with cancer-specific translocation breakpoints, repetitive elements, and CpG islands. Our results show that, on average, fragile sites are denser in miRNAs and also in protein coding genes. However, the distribution of miRNAs and protein coding genes in fragile versus non-fragile sites depends on chromosome. We find also a positive correlation between fragility and repeats, and between miRNAs and CpG islands. Conclusion Our results show that the relationship between site fragility and miRNA density is far more complex than previously thought. For example, we find that protein coding genes seem to be following similar patterns as miRNAs, if considered their overall distribution. However, once we allow for differences at the chromosome level in our statistical analysis, we find that distribution of miRNA and protein coding genes in fragile sites is very different from that of miRNA. This is a novel result that we believe may help discover new potential correlations between the localization of miRNAs and their crucial role in biological processes and in the development of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2110450018,"Chemokines are characterized by the homing activity of leukocytes to targeted inflammation sites. Recent research indicates that chemokines play more divergent roles in various phases of pathogenesis as well as immune reactions. The chemokine receptor, CCR1, and its ligands are thought to be involved in inflammatory bone destruction, but their physiological roles in the bone metabolism in vivo have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the roles of CCR1 in bone metabolism using CCR1-deficient mice. Ccr1(-/-) mice have fewer and thinner trabecular bones and low mineral bone density in cancellous bones. The lack of CCR1 affects the differentiation and function of osteoblasts. Runx2, Atf4, Osteopontin, and Osteonectin were significantly up-regulated in Ccr1(-/-) mice despite sustained expression of Osterix and reduced expression of Osteocalcin, suggesting a lower potential for differentiation into mature osteoblasts. In addition, mineralized nodule formation was markedly disrupted in cultured osteoblastic cells isolated from Ccr1(-/-) mice. Osteoclastogenesis induced from cultured Ccr1(-/-) bone marrow cells yielded fewer and smaller osteoclasts due to the abrogated cell-fusion. Ccr1(-/-) osteoclasts exerted no osteolytic activity concomitant with reduced expressions of Rank and its downstream targets, implying that the defective osteoclastogenesis is involved in the bone phenotype in Ccr1(-/-) mice. The co-culture of wild-type osteoclast precursors with Ccr1(-/-) osteoblasts failed to facilitate osteoclastogenesis. This finding is most likely due to a reduction in Rankl expression. These observations suggest that the axis of CCR1 and its ligands are likely to be involved in cross-talk between osteoclasts and osteoblasts by modulating the RANK-RANKL-mediated interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2148931092,"Background The period of complementary feeding, starting around 6 months of age, is a time of high risk for growth faltering and morbidity. Low micronutrient density of locally available foods is a common problem in low income countries. Children of HIV-infected women are especially vulnerable. Although antiretroviral prophylaxis can reduce breast milk HIV transmission in early infancy, there are no clear feeding guidelines for after 6 months. There is a need for acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe (AFASS by WHO terminology) foods for both HIV-exposed and unexposed children after 6 months of age. Methods and Findings We conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, a randomised double-blind trial of two locally made infant foods: porridges made of flour composed of maize, beans, bambaranuts and groundnuts. One flour contained a basal and the other a rich level of micronutrient fortification. Infants (n = 743) aged 6 months were randomised to receive either regime for 12 months. The primary outcome was stunting (length-for-age Z<−2) at age 18 months. No significant differences were seen between trial arms overall in proportion stunted at 18 months (adjusted odds ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.50, 1.53; P = 0.63), mean length-for-age Z score, or rate of hospital referral or death. Among children of HIV-infected mothers who breastfed <6 months (53% of HIV-infected mothers), the richly-fortified porridge increased length-for-age and reduced stunting (adjusted odds ratio 0.17; 95% CI 0.04, 0.84; P = 0.03). Rich fortification improved iron status at 18 months as measured by hemoglobin, ferritin and serum transferrin receptors. Conclusions In the whole study population, the rich micronutrient fortification did not reduce stunting or hospital referral but did improve iron status and reduce anemia. Importantly, in the infants of HIV-infected mothers who stopped breastfeeding before 6 months, the rich fortification improved linear growth. Provision of such fortified foods may benefit health of these high risk infants. Trial registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN37460449"
https://openalex.org/W1974841615,"Soil biota may trigger strong physiological responses in plants and consequently induce distinct phenotypes. Plant phenotype, in turn, has a strong impact on herbivore performance. Here, we tested the hypothesis that aboveground herbivores are able to adapt to plant phenotypes induced by soil biota.We bred spider mites for 15 generations on snap beans with three different belowground biotic interactions: (i) no biota (to serve as control), (ii) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and (ii) root-feeding nematodes. Subsequently, we conducted a reciprocal selection experiment using these spider mites, which had been kept on the differently treated plants. Belowground treatments induced changes in plant biomass, nutrient composition and water content. No direct chemical defence through cyanogenesis was detected in any of the plant groups. Growth rates of spider mites were higher on the ecotypes on which they were bred for 15 generations, although the statistical significance disappeared for mites from the nematode treatment when corrected for all multiple comparisons.These results demonstrate that belowground biota may indeed impose selection on the aboveground insect herbivores mediated by the host plant. The observed adaptation was driven by variable quantitative changes of the different separately studied life history traits (i.e. fecundity, longevity, sex-ratio, time to maturity)."
https://openalex.org/W2020160421,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that enhances the hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides. In addition to its role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, mGlu1 has been shown to be involved in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. In this capacity, we have reported previously that in neuronal cells, mGlu1a exhibits the properties of a dependence receptor, inducing apoptosis in the absence of glutamate, while promoting neuronal survival in its presence (Pshenichkin, S., Dolińska, M., Klauzińska, M., Luchenko, V., Grajkowska, E., and Wroblewski, J. T. (2008) Neuropharmacology 55, 500–508). Here, using CHO cells expressing mGlu1a receptors, we show that the protective effect of glutamate does not rely on the classical mGlu1 signal transduction. Instead, mGlu1a protective signaling is mediated by a novel, G protein-independent, pathway which involves the activation of the MAPK pathway and a sustained phosphorylation of ERK, which is distinct from the G protein-mediated transient ERK phosphorylation. Moreover, the sustained phosphorylation of ERK and protective signaling through mGlu1a receptors require expression of β-arrestin-1, suggesting a possible role for receptor internalization in this process. Our data reveal the existence of a novel, noncanonical signaling pathway associated with mGlu1a receptors, which mediates glutamate-induced protective signaling.

Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19341-19345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), seven transmembrane-spanning domains, and a variable length intracellular C-terminal domain. The second intracellular loop and portions of the C terminus are responsible for binding of G proteins and therefore for the coupling of mGlu receptors to the different second messenger systems (5Pin J.P.

Several studies indicate that activation of group I mGlu receptors promotes neuronal death. Such results have been demonstrated in an in vivo model of rat traumatic brain injury and in an in vitro model of traumatic injury of rat cortical neurons (11Mukhin A. Fan L. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6012-6020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toxic effects of group I mGlu receptors appear to be mediated through mechanisms including the activation of protein kinase C (12Bruno V.

Nature. 1992; 357: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). In contrast, several other studies indicate that in the presence of glutamate, mGlu1 induces signaling that facilitates growth and development as opposed to neurotoxicity. When stimulated with glutamate, mGlu1 has been shown to stimulate axon migration in the developing CNS (17Kreibich T.A. Chalasani S.H. Raper J.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7085-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and outgrowth of dendritic spines in the developing hippocampus (18Vanderklish P.W. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1639-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We have described recently that mGlu1a produces dual neuroprotective and neurotoxic signaling in cerebellar and cortical neurons (1Pshenichkin S. Dolińska M. Klauzińska M. Luchenko V. Grajkowska E. Wroblewski J.T. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, mGlu1a exhibits the properties of a dependence receptor (19Mehlen P. Bredesen D.E. Apoptosis. 2004; 9: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Chao M.V. Sci STKE. 2003; 2003: PE38PubMed Google Scholar), inducing apoptosis in the absence of glutamate, while promoting neuronal survival in its presence. However, the mechanisms of this neuroprotective signaling are unknown. Like other G protein-coupled receptors, mGlu1a is internalized both constitutively and in response to agonist stimulation (21Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the presence of agonists, mGlu1a undergoes rapid homologous desensitization and can be internalized in a β-arrestin-dependent manner (21Dale L.B. Bhattacharya M. Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Mundell S.J. Matharu A.L. Pula G. Roberts P.J. Kelly E. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the process of β-arrestin-mediated endocytosis, mGlu1a may be phosphorylated by several G protein-coupled receptor kinases (23Iacovelli L. Salvatore L. Capobianco L. Picascia A. Barletta E. Storto M. Mariggiò S. Sallese M. Porcellini A. Nicoletti F. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12433-12442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The association of receptors with β-arrestin also has been shown to induce receptor-mediated transient phosphorylation of ERK (23Iacovelli L. Salvatore L. Capobianco L. Picascia A. Barletta E. Storto M. Mariggiò S. Sallese M. Porcellini A. Nicoletti F. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12433-12442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ERK functions in the MAPK pathway downstream of MEK1/2 and the phosphorylation of ERK is a critical step in signal transduction from the membrane to the nucleus and usually causes protective or mitogenic cellular responses (24Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3207) Google Scholar). Although a relatively recently described signal transduction pathway, numerous GPCRs have been shown to couple to ERK phosphorylation in a β-arrestin-dependent manner (25Kenakin T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, ERK can be activated by both β-arrestin-dependent and Gq/11-dependent signaling pathways (26Wei H. Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Karnik S.S. Hunyady L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10782-10787Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In several systems, including PAC1 and VPAC receptors, these parallel pathways have been described where ERK phosphorylation due to G protein activation is transient, whereas phosphorylation is sustained over time when ERK is bound to β-arrestin (27Broca C. Quoyer J. Costes S. Linck N. Varrault A. Deffayet P.M. Bockaert J. Dalle S. Bertrand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4332-4342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to identify the signal transduction pathway through which glutamate causes protective signaling in cells expressing mGlu1a receptors. We have determined that glutamate, but not quisqualate, stimulates a sustained phosphorylation of ERK through mGlu1a receptors. This phenomenon was unique to mGlu1a and required the expression of β-arrestin-1. Moreover, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation and silencing of β-arrestin-1 expression abolished the protective effects of glutamate. We conclude that the protective signaling of mGlu1a receptors does not rely on the classical, G protein-mediated, mechanism of signal transduction, but, instead involves a β-arrestin-dependent receptor internalization and ERK phosphorylation. DMEM and fetal bovine serum for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen. Receptor agonists glutamate and quisqualate, antagonists CPCCOEt, YM 298198, and JNJ16259685, and inhibitors U73122, U0126, PD98059, and dynasore were obtained from Tocris Cookson (Ellisville, MO). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. CHO cells were stably transfected with mGlu receptor cDNA in pcDNA-3.1 vector (Invitrogen) using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Individual cell lines were isolated and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.8 mg/ml G-418 for selection (Invitrogen). For viability assays, confluent cells were treated in media not containing serum or l-glutamine. SureSilencing shRNA targeted against rat β-arrestin-1 (insert sequence, ATGGAGGAAGC-TGATGATACT) and scrambled control were contained in the pGeneClip hygromycin vector (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). CHO cells stably expressing mGlu1a were transfected with plasmid-based shRNA and selected in 0.8 mg/ml hygromycin B. Knockdown of β-arrestin-1 was confirmed by Western blotting. Refractory to the effects of shRNA targeted against rat β-arrestin-1, human β-arrestin-1, which was subcloned in pcDNA 6.2, was used in rescue experiments. Cells grown and treated in 35-mm dishes were collected in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails with 1 mm EDTA (Pierce). Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli buffer containing 50 mm Dithiothreitol, and equal amounts of sample protein were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and were probed with antibodies against mGlu1a (BD Biosciences), β-arrestin-1 (Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204), and total p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Proteins were visualized by incubation with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) followed by exposure to chemiluminescent HRP substrate SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce). Films were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software (Rasband, ImageJ). Receptor endocytosis was assayed as described previously (28Jeanneteau F. Funalot B. Jankovic J. Deng H. Lagarde J.P. Lucotte G. Sokoloff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10753-10758Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 35-mm dishes were washed in PBS and labeled for 30 min with cleavable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). For 20 min, excess biotin was quenched with 100 mm glycine. Labeled cells were then incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of glutamate at 37 °C. Stimulation was halted by washing and chilling the cells in cold PBS. Extracellular biotin was then cleaved by two washes with 50 mm glutathione, 75 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaOH, and 10% FBS in water for 15 min. Excess glutathione was then quenched for 30 min in PBS containing 50 mm iodoacetamide and 1% BSA. Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, and Halt protease inhibitor mixtures) and clarified, and equal biotinylated proteins were precipitated with NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce). Proteins were rinsed four times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, solubilized in Laemmli buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated ERK was measured using cell-based ELISA according to a protocol described previously (29Versteeg H.H. Nijhuis E. van den Brink G.R. Evertzen M. Pynaert G.N. van Deventer S.J. Coffer P.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cells were grown and treated with agonists in 96-well plates. After incubation with agonist, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for membrane permeabilization, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by a 20-min incubation in PBS containing 0.5% H2O2 and 0.2% NaN3. After three more washes in PBST, cells were blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h and incubated overnight with primary antibody against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were then washed for 5 min three times in PBST and twice in PBS. An HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Pierce) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then cells were again washed five times. Cells were exposed to the colorimetric HRP substrate one-step ultra TMB (Pierce). After 10 min of developing, the reaction was stopped in 4 m H2SO4, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. Viability of cells cultured on 96-well plates was measured by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.2 mg/ml of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, which was purchased from Invitrogen. The formation of the formazan product, proportional to the number of viable cells, was measured colorimetrically at 570 nm after extraction with 70 μl DMSO (30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46488) Google Scholar). Cells, cultured in 96-well plates, were incubated overnight with 0.625 μCi/well myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to label the cell membrane phosphoinositides. After two washes with 0.1 ml of Locke's buffer (156 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) incubations with receptor ligands were carried out for 45 min at 37 °C in Locke's buffer containing 20 mm LiCl to block inositol phosphate degradation. The reaction was terminated by aspiration of media and inositol phosphates were extracted with 60 μl formic acid (0.1 m) for 30 min. 40-μl samples were transferred to opaque-walled plates and incubated with 60 μl polylysine-coated yttrium scintillation proximity assay beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with vigorous shaking. After 8 h of incubation with SPA beads, inositol phosphates were detected by scintillation counting. For dose-response data, curves were fitted by nonlinear regression to data points using four-parameter logistic equation. Significance testing was performed using Student's t tests when comparing two groups or by Bonferroni-corrected t tests when comparing multiple groups. Statistical significance was deemed by p < 0.01. Our previous studies in primary cultures of cortical and cerebellar neurons have shown that glutamate, acting selectively at mGlu1a receptors, rescued these neurons from apoptotic cell death induced by conditions of trophic deprivation (1Pshenichkin S. Dolińska M. Klauzińska M. Luchenko V. Grajkowska E. Wroblewski J.T. Neuropharmacology. 2008; 55: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This protective effect of glutamate was revealed in the presence of antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which suppressed the excitotoxic actions of glutamate. Moreover, in these cells, the protective effect was elicited by high concentrations of glutamate, ∼10 times higher than those needed to activate mGlu1-mediated PI hydrolysis. To study the pharmacological and protective properties of mGlu1a without interference from other glutamate receptors, we used CHO cells with stably expressed mGlu1a receptors to assess the potency of mGlu1 agonists in producing the protective effect. Cells were transferred to serum-free culture medium to induce apoptosis (31Zhong L.T. Sarafian T. Kane D.J. Charles A.C. Mah S.P. Edwards R.H. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 4533-4537Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and their viability was monitored by the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Under these conditions, after 3 days, cells exhibited ∼35–50% viability relative to controls grown in serum-containing medium. Cells exposed to 3 mm glutamate were fully protected from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis for up to 6 days, having similar viability to control cells grown in serum-containing growth media, whereas lower concentrations of glutamate (0.3 mm) produced a partial protection from serum deprivation (Fig. 1A). The protective effect of glutamate required the presence of mGlu1a as untransfected CHO cells were not protected from serum deprivation (Fig. 1B). Also, among PLC-coupled mGlu receptors only mGlu1, but not mGlu5, was effective in protecting from toxicity induced by serum deprivation (Fig. 1B). The addition of glutamate to the serum-free culture medium produced a dose-dependent increase in viability with an EC50 of 153 + 31 μm; however, quisqualate, the most potent mGlu1 agonist, was not effective in concentrations up to 3 mm (Fig. 1C). To further ascertain that the protective effect is in fact due to the activation of mGlu1, and not to a nonspecific effect involving glutamate transporters, glutamate-induced protection was tested in the presence of three distinct noncompetitive mGlu1-selective antagonists. Application of 100 μm CPCCOEt (32Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prézeau L. Pin J.P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μm YM-298198 (33Kohara A. Toya T. Tamura S. Watabiki T. Nagakura Y. Shitaka Y. Hayashibe S. Kawabata S. Okada M. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Lesage A.S. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) completely inhibited the activity of 1 mm glutamate (Fig. 1D). A more detailed analysis showed that YM-298198 inhibited glutamate-induced protection in a noncompetitive manner with increasing concentrations of the antagonist decreasing glutamate efficacy but having no effect on its potency as shown by similar glutamate EC50 values in the presence of different concentrations of antagonist (Fig. 1E and Table 1).TABLE 1Comparison of potency and efficacy of glutamate to induce protection and stimulate PI hydrolysis in the absence and presence of the noncompetitive antagonist YM-289198 in CHO cells expressing mGlu1a receptorsProtection from toxicityPI hydrolysisEC50EmaxEC50Emaxμm% controlμm% basalYM-298198 0 μm191 ± 2793 ± 1.728 ± 3.1259 ± 5.0 0.03 μm180 ± 1174 ± 3.6ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.42 ± 4.8ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.233 ± 16 0.3 μm160 ± 5663 ± 2.4ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.94 ± 6.0ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.198 ± 14ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test. 3 μm153 ± 2053 ± 0.9ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.171 ± 11ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.157 ± 12ap < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test.a p < 0.05 compared with values obtained in the absence of antagonist using Bonferroni-adjusted t test. Open table in a new tab The observed pharmacological properties of mGlu1a in inducing the protective effect were inconsistent with its known properties in stimulating G protein-mediated PI hydrolysis (7Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). To study this discrepancy, we have determined the potency of agonists to stimulate PI hydrolysis in CHO cells expressing mGlu1a that were used in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, both glutamate and quisqualate stimulated PI hydrolysis in a dose-dependent manner with quisqualate being more potent (EC50 = 0.63 ± 0.13 μm) than glutamate (EC50 = 16 ± 1.2 μm). Hence, the potency of glutamate to induce protection was ∼10 times lower than its potency to stimulate PI hydrolysis. One possible explanation for these differences would be that the potencies observed in protection reflect an artifactual decrease of agonist concentrations occurring during the 3-day incubation that would not appear in the 45-min incubation used when measuring PI hydrolysis. In control experiments testing agonist stability, glutamate and quisqualate were incubated with CHO cells for 3 days and then used to stimulate PI hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, both conditioned and freshly prepared agonists stimulated PI hydrolysis to the same extent, demonstrating that these compounds remain intact for the entire 3-day incubation and that the observed discrepancies do not result from a decrease in agonist concentration. As expected, glutamate-stimulated PI hydrolysis was abolished by the selective noncompetitive mGlu1 antagonist YM-298198 (33Kohara A. Toya T. Tamura S. Watabiki T. Nagakura Y. Shitaka Y. Hayashibe S. Kawabata S. Okada M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 315: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the antagonism appeared noncompetitive as seen by the decrease of the maximal effect of glutamate with increasing concentrations of the antagonist (Fig. 2C). However, in contrast with the data obtained for glutamate protective signaling, the calculated potency of glutamate in PI hydrolysis experiments decreased with increasing antagonist concentrations (Table 1). Usually, such right shifts of agonist potency in the presence of a noncompetitive antagonist indicate the existence of receptor reserve (also known as spare receptors) and are frequently seen in heterologous expression systems. This allows us to conclude that the apparent difference in potency of glutamate to produce both effects results from the presence of a high receptor reserve for PI hydrolysis but no receptor reserve for protective signaling. The use of the highest concentration of YM-298198 in PI hydrolysis experiments increases the EC50 of glutamate to the levels observed in protection experiments. Hence, once this receptor reserve is abolished by the use of a noncompetitive antagonist, the potency of glutamate to produce both effects is the same. Although our pharmacological results confirm that the protective signaling and PI hydrolysis are mediated by the same receptor, they also indicate the existence of ligand bias in producing the two effects. Ligand bias is defined as the ability of some agonists, such as quisqualate, to activate only selected signal transduction mechanisms, whereas other agonists, such as glutamate, may activate all signaling associated with this receptor (25Kenakin T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Our data also suggest that the protective effect mediated by mGlu1a receptor is not related to its ability to stimulate PI hydrolysis but, rather, is mediated by a different signal transduction mechanism. To identify the mechanism through which mGlu1a elicits protective signaling, we used a selective inhibitor of signaling, which occurs downstream of G protein activation. Because mGlu1 typically couples to PLC through Gq/11 (7Aramori I. Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 757-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 8Pickering D.S. Thomsen C.

In conditions of serum deprivation for 3 days, U73122 (30 μm) failed to block the protective effect of glutamate (Fig. 3A). In control experiments, 30 μm culture-conditioned U73122 effectively blocked glutamate-induced PI hydrolysis (Fig. 3B), indicating that this compound is stable in these culture conditions and is effective in blocking PI hydrolysis in this model. These data, therefore, indicate that the protective effect is not mediated by the coupling of mGlu1a receptors to PLC.

https://openalex.org/W2062699170,"Pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme (PFL-AE) activates pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) by generating a catalytically essential radical on Gly-734 of PFL. Crystal structures of unactivated PFL reveal that Gly-734 is buried 8 A from the surface of the protein in what we refer to here as the closed conformation of PFL. We provide here the first experimental evidence for an alternate open conformation of PFL in which: (i) the glycyl radical is significantly less stable; (ii) the activated enzyme exhibits lower catalytic activity; (iii) the glycyl radical undergoes less H/D exchange with solvent; and (iv) the T(m) of the protein is decreased. The evidence suggests that in the open conformation of PFL, the Gly-734 residue is located not in its buried position in the enzyme active site but rather in a more solvent-exposed location. Further, we find that the presence of the PFL-AE increases the proportion of PFL in the open conformation; this observation supports the idea that PFL-AE accesses Gly-734 for direct hydrogen atom abstraction by binding to the Gly-734 loop in the open conformation, thereby shifting the closed <--> open equilibrium of PFL to the right. Together, our results lead to a model in which PFL can exist in either a closed conformation, with Gly-734 buried in the active site of PFL and harboring a stable glycyl radical, or an open conformation, with Gly-734 more solvent-exposed and accessible to the PFL-AE active site. The equilibrium between these two conformations of PFL is modulated by the interaction with PFL-AE."
https://openalex.org/W1965210967,"FOXO transcription factors are an important, conserved family of regulators of cellular processes including metabolism, cell-cycle progression, apoptosis and stress resistance. They are required for the efficacy of several of the genetic interventions that modulate lifespan. FOXO activity is regulated by multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) that affect its subcellular localization, half-life, DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Here, we show how a mathematical modelling approach can be used to simulate the effects, singly and in combination, of these PTMs. Our model is implemented using the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), generated by an ancillary program and simulated in a stochastic framework. The use of the ancillary program to generate the SBML is necessary because the possibility that many regulatory PTMs may be added, each independently of the others, means that a large number of chemically distinct forms of the FOXO molecule must be taken into account, and the program is used to generate them. Although the model does not yet include detailed representations of events upstream and downstream of FOXO, we show how it can qualitatively, and in some cases quantitatively, reproduce the known effects of certain treatments that induce various single and multiple PTMs, and allows for a complex spatiotemporal interplay of effects due to the activation of multiple PTM-inducing treatments. Thus, it provides an important framework to integrate current knowledge about the behaviour of FOXO. The approach should be generally applicable to other proteins experiencing multiple regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2057448179,"Mismatch repair of AID-generated dU:G mispairs is critical for class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in B cells. The generation of a previously unavailable Msh2(-/-)Msh6(-/-) mouse has for the first time allowed us to examine the impact of the complete loss of MutSalpha on lymphomagenesis, CSR and SHM. The onset of T cell lymphomas and the survival of Msh2(-/-)Msh6(-/-) and Msh2(-/-)Msh6(-/-)Msh3(-/-) mice are indistinguishable from Msh2(-/-) mice, suggesting that MSH2 plays the critical role in protecting T cells from malignant transformation, presumably because it is essential for the formation of stable MutSalpha heterodimers that maintain genomic stability. The similar defects on switching in Msh2(-/-), Msh2(-/-)Msh6(-/-) and Msh2(-/-)Msh6(-/-)Msh3(-/-) mice confirm that MutSalpha but not MutSbeta plays an important role in CSR. Analysis of SHM in Msh2(-/-)Msh6(-/-) mice not only confirmed the error-prone role of MutSalpha in the generation of strand biased mutations at A:T bases, but also revealed an error-free role of MutSalpha when repairing some of the dU:G mispairs generated by AID on both DNA strands. We propose a model for the role of MutSalpha at the immunoglobulin locus where the local balance of error-free and error-prone repair has an impact in the spectrum of mutations introduced during Phase 2 of SHM."
https://openalex.org/W2094707357,"In this study, we searched for proteins regulating the tumor suppressor and life-span regulator FOXO4. Through an unbiased tandem-affinity purification strategy combined with mass spectrometry, we identified the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 (Ku), a DNA double-strand break repair component. Using biochemical interaction studies, we found Ku70 to be necessary and sufficient for the interaction. FOXO4 mediates its tumor-suppressive function in part through transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle arrest p27(kip1) gene. Immunoblotting, luciferase reporter assays, and flow cytometry showed that Ku70 inhibited FOXO4-mediated p27(kip1) transcription and cell cycle arrest induction by >40%. In contrast, Ku70 RNAi but not control RNAi significantly increased p27(kip1) transcription. In addition, in contrast to wild-type mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, Ku70(-/-) ES cells showed significantly increased FOXO activity, which was rescued by Ku70 reexpression. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that Ku70 sequestered FOXO4 in the nucleus. Interestingly, the Ku70-FOXO4 interaction stoichiometry followed a nonlinear dose-response curve by hydrogen peroxide-generated oxidative stress. Low levels of oxidative stress increased interaction stoichiometry up to 75%, peaking at 50 μM, after which dissociation occurred. Because the Ku70 ortholog in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans was shown to regulate life span involving C. elegans FOXO, our findings suggest a conserved critical Ku70 role for FOXO function toward coordination of a survival program, regulated by the magnitude of oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2002211286,"Neonatal mortality contributes a large proportion towards early childhood mortality in developing countries, with considerable geographical variation at small areas within countries.A geo-additive logistic regression model is proposed for quantifying small-scale geographical variation in neonatal mortality, and to estimate risk factors of neonatal mortality. Random effects are introduced to capture spatial correlation and heterogeneity. The spatial correlation can be modelled using the Markov random fields (MRF) when data is aggregated, while the two dimensional P-splines apply when exact locations are available, whereas the unstructured spatial effects are assigned an independent Gaussian prior. Socio-economic and bio-demographic factors which may affect the risk of neonatal mortality are simultaneously estimated as fixed effects and as nonlinear effects for continuous covariates. The smooth effects of continuous covariates are modelled by second-order random walk priors. Modelling and inference use the empirical Bayesian approach via penalized likelihood technique. The methodology is applied to analyse the likelihood of neonatal deaths, using data from the 2000 Malawi demographic and health survey. The spatial effects are quantified through MRF and two dimensional P-splines priors.Findings indicate that both fixed and spatial effects are associated with neonatal mortality.Our study, therefore, suggests that the challenge to reduce neonatal mortality goes beyond addressing individual factors, but also require to understanding unmeasured covariates for potential effective interventions."

https://openalex.org/W2031491717,"In 1977, H1N1 influenza A virus reappeared after a 20-year absence. Genetic analysis indicated that this strain was missing decades of nucleotide sequence evolution, suggesting an accidental release of a frozen laboratory strain into the general population. Recently, this strain and its descendants were included in an analysis attempting to date the origin of pandemic influenza virus without accounting for the missing decades of evolution. Here, we investigated the effect of using viral isolates with biologically unrealistic sampling dates on estimates of divergence dates. Not accounting for missing sequence evolution produced biased results and increased the variance of date estimates of the most recent common ancestor of the re-emergent lineages and across the entire phylogeny. Reanalysis of the H1N1 sequences excluding isolates with unrealistic sampling dates indicates that the 1977 re-emergent lineage was circulating for approximately one year before detection, making it difficult to determine the geographic source of reintroduction. We suggest that a new method is needed to account for viral isolates with unrealistic sampling dates."

https://openalex.org/W2092888039,"Background Many situations involving animal communication are dominated by recurring, stereotyped signals. How do receivers optimally distinguish between frequently recurring signals and novel ones? Cortical auditory systems are known to be pre-attentively sensitive to short-term delivery statistics of artificial stimuli, but it is unknown if this phenomenon extends to the level of behaviorally relevant delivery patterns, such as those used during communication. Methodology/Principal Findings We recorded and analyzed complete auditory scenes of spontaneously communicating zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) pairs over a week-long period, and show that they can produce tens of thousands of short-range contact calls per day. Individual calls recur at time scales (median interval 1.5 s) matching those at which mammalian sensory systems are sensitive to recent stimulus history. Next, we presented to anesthetized birds sequences of frequently recurring calls interspersed with rare ones, and recorded, in parallel, action and local field potential responses in the medio-caudal auditory forebrain at 32 unique sites. Variation in call recurrence rate over natural ranges leads to widespread and significant modulation in strength of neural responses. Such modulation is highly call-specific in secondary auditory areas, but not in the main thalamo-recipient, primary auditory area. Conclusions/Significance Our results support the hypothesis that pre-attentive neural sensitivity to short-term stimulus recurrence is involved in the analysis of auditory scenes at the level of delivery patterns of meaningful sounds. This may enable birds to efficiently and automatically distinguish frequently recurring vocalizations from other events in their auditory scene."
https://openalex.org/W2026564473,"Lithium (Li(+)) is a common treatment for bipolar mood disorder, a major psychiatric illness with a lifetime prevalence of more than 1%. Risk of bipolar disorder is heavily influenced by genetic predisposition, but is a complex genetic trait and, to date, genetic studies have provided little insight into its molecular origins. An alternative approach is to investigate the genetics of Li(+) sensitivity. Using the social amoeba Dictyostelium, we previously identified prolyl oligopeptidase (PO) as a modulator of Li(+) sensitivity. In a link to the clinic, PO enzyme activity is altered in bipolar disorder patients. Further studies demonstrated that PO is a negative regulator of inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate (IP(3)) synthesis, a Li(+) sensitive intracellular signal. However, it was unclear how PO could influence either Li(+) sensitivity or risk of bipolar disorder. Here we show that in both Dictyostelium and cultured human cells PO acts via Multiple Inositol Polyphosphate Phosphatase (Mipp1) to control gene expression. This reveals a novel, gene regulatory network that modulates inositol metabolism and Li(+) sensitivity. Among its targets is the inositol monophosphatase gene IMPA2, which has also been associated with risk of bipolar disorder in some family studies, and our observations offer a cellular signalling pathway in which PO activity and IMPA2 gene expression converge."
https://openalex.org/W2046932463,"This study addresses force/movement control in a dynamic ""hybrid"" task: the master sub-task is continuous manual tracking of a target moving along an eight-shaped Lissajous figure, with the tracking error as the primary performance index; the slave sub-task is compensation of a disturbing curl viscous field, compatibly with the primary performance index. The two sub-tasks are correlated because the lateral force the subject must exert on the eight-shape must be proportional to the longitudinal movement speed in order to perform a good tracking. The results confirm that visuo-manual tracking is characterized by an intermittent control mechanism, in agreement with previous work; the novel finding is that the overall control patterns are not altered by the presence of a large deviating force field, if compared with the undisturbed condition. It is also found that the control of interaction-forces is achieved by a combination of arm stiffness properties and direct force control, as suggested by the systematic lateral deviation of the trajectories from the nominal path and the comparison between perturbed trials and catch trials. The coordination of the two sub-tasks is quickly learnt after the activation of the deviating force field and is achieved by a combination of force and the stiffness components (about 80% vs. 20%), which is a function of the implicit accuracy of the tracking task."
https://openalex.org/W2049941081,"Recent behavioral studies report correlational evidence to suggest that non-musicians with good pitch discrimination sing more accurately than those with poorer auditory skills. However, other studies have reported a dissociation between perceptual and vocal production skills. In order to elucidate the relationship between auditory discrimination skills and vocal accuracy, we administered an auditory-discrimination training paradigm to a group of non-musicians to determine whether training-enhanced auditory discrimination would specifically result in improved vocal accuracy.We utilized micromelodies (i.e., melodies with seven different interval scales, each smaller than a semitone) as the main stimuli for auditory discrimination training and testing, and we used single-note and melodic singing tasks to assess vocal accuracy in two groups of non-musicians (experimental and control). To determine if any training-induced improvements in vocal accuracy would be accompanied by related modulations in cortical activity during singing, the experimental group of non-musicians also performed the singing tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Following training, the experimental group exhibited significant enhancements in micromelody discrimination compared to controls. However, we did not observe a correlated improvement in vocal accuracy during single-note or melodic singing, nor did we detect any training-induced changes in activity within brain regions associated with singing.Given the observations from our auditory training regimen, we therefore conclude that perceptual discrimination training alone is not sufficient to improve vocal accuracy in non-musicians, supporting the suggested dissociation between auditory perception and vocal production."
https://openalex.org/W1989752449,"For evolving populations of replicators, there is much evidence that the effect of mutations on fitness depends on the degree of adaptation to the selective pressures at play. In optimized populations, most mutations have deleterious effects, such that low mutation rates are favoured. In contrast to this, in populations thriving in changing environments a larger fraction of mutations have beneficial effects, providing the diversity necessary to adapt to new conditions. What is more, non-adapted populations occasionally benefit from an increase in the mutation rate. Therefore, there is no optimal universal value of the mutation rate and species attempt to adjust it to their momentary adaptive needs. In this work we have used stationary populations of RNA molecules evolving in silico to investigate the relationship between the degree of adaptation of an optimized population and the value of the mutation rate promoting maximal adaptation in a short time to a new selective pressure. Our results show that this value can significantly differ from the optimal value at mutation-selection equilibrium, being strongly influenced by the structure of the population when the adaptive process begins. In the short-term, highly optimized populations containing little variability respond better to environmental changes upon an increase of the mutation rate, whereas populations with a lower degree of optimization but higher variability benefit from reducing the mutation rate to adapt rapidly. These findings show a good agreement with the behaviour exhibited by actual organisms that replicate their genomes under broadly different mutation rates."
https://openalex.org/W2084090150,"Background The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response is one of the major factors determining the genetic diversity of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There are few population-based analyses of the amino acid variations associated with the host HLA type and their clinical relevance for the Asian population. Here, we identified HLA-associated polymorphisms in the HIV-1 CRF01_AE Gag protein in infected married couples, and examined the consequences of these HLA-selected mutations after transmission to HLA-unmatched recipients. Methodology/Principal Findings One hundred sixteen HIV-1-infected couples were recruited at a government hospital in northern Thailand. The 1.7-kb gag gene was amplified and directly sequenced. We identified 56 associations between amino acid variations in Gag and HLA alleles. Of those amino acid variations, 35 (62.5%) were located within or adjacent to regions reported to be HIV-specific CTL epitopes restricted by the relevant HLA. Interestingly, a significant number of HLA-associated amino acid variations appear to be unique to the CRF01_AE-infected Thai population. Variations in the capsid protein (p24) had the strongest associations with the viral load and CD4 cell count. The mutation and reversion rates after transmission to a host with a different HLA environment varied considerably. The p24 T242N variant escape from B57/58 CTL had a significant impact on the HIV-1 viral load of CRF01_AE-infected patients. Conclusions/Significance HLA-associated amino acid mutations and the CTL selection pressures on the p24 antigen appear to have the most significant impact on HIV replication in a CRF01_AE-infected Asian population. HLA-associated mutations with a low reversion rate accumulated as a footprint in this Thai population. The novel HLA-associated mutations identified in this study encourage us to acquire more extensive information about the viral dynamics of HLA-associated amino acid polymorphisms in a given population as effective CTL vaccine targets."
https://openalex.org/W2007185081,"Background General anesthesia is routinely used as a surgical procedure and its safety has been endorsed by clinical outcomes; however, its effects at the molecular level have not been elucidated. General anesthetics influence glucose metabolism in the brain. However, the effects of anesthetics on brain metabolites other than those related to glucose have not been well characterized. We used a pattern recognition analysis of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra to visualize the changes in holistic brain metabolic phenotypes in response to the widely used intravenous anesthetic propofol and the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. Methodology/Principal Findings Rats were randomized into five groups (n = 7 each group). Propofol and isoflurane were administered to two groups each, for 2 or 6 h. The control group received no anesthesia. Brains were removed directly after anesthesia. Hydrophilic compounds were extracted from excised whole brains and measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All spectral data were processed and analyzed by principal component analysis for comparison of the metabolite profiles. Data were visualized by plotting principal component (PC) scores. In the plots, each point represents an individual sample. The propofol and isoflurane groups were clustered separately on the plots, and this separation was especially pronounced when comparing the 6-h groups. The PC scores of the propofol group were clearly distinct from those of the control group, particularly in the 6-h group, whereas the difference in PC scores was more subtle in the isoflurane group and control groups. Conclusions/Significance The results of the present study showed that propofol and isoflurane exerted differential effects on holistic brain metabolism under anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W2029911534,"Background Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with multiple functions that regulates energy homeostasis and reproductive functions. Increased knowledge of leptin receptor function will enhance our understanding of the physiological roles of leptin in animals. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, a full-length leptin receptor (lepr) cDNA, consisting of 1,353 nucleotides, was cloned from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) following the identification of a single expressed sequence tag (EST) clone in a cDNA library. The lepr cDNA consisted of a 22-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region (5′ UTR), a 402-nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) and a 929-nucleotide 3′ UTR. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that Chinese mitten crab lepr shared a conserved vacuolar protein sorting 55 (Vps55) domain with other species. Chinese mitten crab lepr expression was determined in various tissues and at three different reproductive stages using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Lepr expression was highest in the intestine, thoracic ganglia, gonad, and accessory gonad, moderate in hepatopancreas and cranial ganglia, and low in muscle, gill, heart, haemocytes, and stomach. Furthermore, lepr expression was significantly higher in the intestine, gonad and thoracic ganglia in immature crabs relative to precocious and mature crabs. In contrast, lepr expression was significantly lower in the hepatopancreas of immature crabs relative to mature crabs. Conclusions/Significance We are the first to identify the lepr gene and to determine its gene expression patterns in various tissues and at three different reproductive stages in Chinese mitten crab. Taken together, our results suggest that lepr may be involved in the nutritional regulation of metabolism and reproduction in Chinese mitten crabs."

We tested expression of kinin receptors by flow cytometry and migratory capacity of circulating monocytes and progenitor cells towards bradykinin (BK) in transwell migration assays. MNC migrating towards BK (BK(mig)) were assessed for capacity to support endothelial cell function in a matrigel assay, as well as generation of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O(2) (-)*) by using the fluorescent probes diaminofluorescein and dihydroethidium.CD14(hi)CD16(neg), CD14(hi)CD16(pos) and CD14(lo)CD16(pos) monocytes and circulating CD34(pos) progenitor cells did not differ between T1D and H subjects in their kinin receptor expression and migration towards BK. T1D BK(mig) failed to generate NO upon BK stimulation and supported endothelial cell network formation less efficiently than H BK(mig). In contrast, O(2) (-)* production was similar between groups. High glucose disturbed BK-induced NO generation by MNC-derived cultured angiogenic cells.Our data point out alterations in kinin-mediated functions of circulating MNC from T1D patients, occurring before manifest macrovascular damage or progressed microvascular disease. Functional defects of MNC recruited to the vessel wall might compromise endothelial maintenance, initially without actively promoting endothelial damage, but rather by lacking supportive contribution to endothelial regeneration and healing."

As the majority of these ORFs have no homologs with characterized sequence or protein structure, traditional sequence-based approaches cannot be applied to deduce their biological function. Here, we characterize YER067W, a conserved gene of unknown function that is strongly induced in response to many stress conditions and repressed in drug resistant yeast strains. Gene expression patterns of YER067W and its paralog YIL057C suggest an involvement in energy metabolism. We show that yeast lacking YER067W display altered levels of reserve carbohydrates and a growth deficiency in media that requires aerobic metabolism. Impaired mitochondrial function and overall reduction of ergosterol content in the YER067W deleted strain explained the observed 2- and 4-fold increase in resistance to the drugs fluconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Cell fractionation and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Yer067w is associated with cellular membranes despite the absence of a transmembrane domain in the protein. Finally, the 1.7 A resolution crystal structure of Yer067w shows an alpha-beta fold with low similarity to known structures and a putative functional site.YER067W's involvement with aerobic energetic metabolism suggests the assignment of the gene name RGI1, standing for respiratory growth induced 1. Altogether, the results shed light on a previously uncharacterized protein family and provide basis for further studies of its apparent role in energy metabolism control and drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2100253111,"Background Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is a key enzyme in the mobilization of energy in the form of fatty acids from intracellular stores of neutral lipids. The enzyme has been shown to exist in different isoforms with different molecular masses (84 kDa, 89 kDa and 117 kDa) expressed in a tissue-dependent manner, where the predominant 84 kDa form in adipocytes is the most extensively studied. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we employed negative stain electron microscopy (EM) to analyze the quarternary structure of the different HSL isoforms. The results show that all three isoforms adopt a head-to-head homodimeric organization, where each monomer contains two structural domains. We also used enzymatic assays to show that despite the variation in the size of the N-terminal domain all three isoforms exhibit similar enzymological properties with regard to psychrotolerance and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation and activation. Conclusions/Significance We present the first data on the quaternary structure and domain organization of the three HSL isoforms. We conclude that despite large differences in the size of the N-terminal, non-catalytic domain all three HSL isoforms exhibit the same three-dimensional architecture. Furthermore, the three HSL isoforms are very similar with regard to two unique enzymological characteristics of HSL, i.e., cold adaptation and PKA-mediated activation."
https://openalex.org/W2031093937,"A binding event between two proteins typically consists of a diffusional search of binding partners for one another, followed by a specific recognition of the compatible binding sites resulting in the formation of the complex. However, it is unclear how binding partners find each other in the context of the crowded, constantly fluctuating, and interaction-rich cellular environment. Here we examine the non-specific component of protein-protein interactions, which refers to those physicochemical properties of the binding partners that are independent of the exact details of their binding sites, but which can affect their localization or diffusional search for one another. We show that, for a large set of high-resolution experimental 3D structures of binary, transient protein complexes taken from the DOCKGROUND database, the binding partners display a surprising, statistically significant similarity in terms of their total hydration free energies normalized by a size-dependent variable. We hypothesize that colocalization of binding partners, even within individual cellular compartments such as the cytoplasm, may be influenced by their relative hydrophilicity, potentially in response to local hydrophilic gradients."

https://openalex.org/W2082312927,"Many proteins mature within the secretory pathway by the acquisition of glycans. Failure to maintain the proper distribution of the glycosylation machinery might lead to disease. High expression levels of the ubiquitous Golgi protein estrogen receptor-binding fragment-associated gene 9 (EBAG9) in human tumors correlate with poor clinical prognosis, and EBAG9 overexpression in epithelial cell lines induces truncated glycans, typical of many carcinomas. Here, we addressed the pathogenetic link between EBAG9 expression and the alteration of the cellular glycome. We applied confocal microscopy, live imaging, pulse-chase labeling in conjunction with immunoprecipitation, and enzymatic activity assays in a variety of EBAG9-overexpressing or depleted epithelial tumor cell lines. EBAG9 shuttles between the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the cis-Golgi, and we demonstrate association of EBAG9 with coat protein complex I (COPI)-coated transport vesicles. EBAG9 overexpression imposes delay of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport and mislocalizes components of the ER quality control and glycosylation machinery. Conversely, EBAG9 down-regulation accelerates glycoprotein transport through the Golgi and enhances mannosidase activity. Thus, EBAG9 acts as a negative regulator of a COPI-dependent ER-to-Golgi transport pathway in epithelial cells and represents a novel pathogenetic principle in which interference with intracellular membrane trafficking results in the emergence of a tumor-associated glycome."
