https://openalex.org/W2057046889,"An unresolved question in neuroscience and psychology is how the brain monitors performance to regulate behavior. It has been proposed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), on the medial surface of the frontal lobe, contributes to performance monitoring by detecting errors. In this study, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine ACC function. Results confirm that this region shows activity during erroneous responses. However, activity was also observed in the same region during correct responses under conditions of increased response competition. This suggests that the ACC detects conditions under which errors are likely to occur rather than errors themselves."

One component of this toxin, lethal factor (LF), is suspected to be a metalloprotease, but no physiological substrates have been identified. Here it is shown that LF is a protease that cleaves the amino terminus of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1 and 2 (MAPKK1 and MAPKK2) and that this cleavage inactivates MAPKK1 and inhibits the MAPK signal transduction pathway. The identification of a cleavage site for LF may facilitate the development of LF inhibitors."

If such decline is to be halted ecological mechanisms that restore or maintain biodiversity are needed. Two long-term field experiments were performed in native grassland to assess the effects of fire, nitrogen addition, and grazing or mowing on plant species diversity. In one experiment, richness declined on burned and fertilized treatments, whereas mowing maintained diversity under these conditions. In the second experiment, loss of species diversity due to frequent burning was reversed by bison, a keystone herbivore in North American grasslands. Thus, mowing or the reestablishment of grazing in anthropogenically stressed grasslands enhanced biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2020334159,"Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of the DM gene. One model of DM pathogenesis suggests that RNAs from the expanded allele create a gain-of-function mutation by the inappropriate binding of proteins to the CUG repeats. Data presented here indicate that the conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP), may mediate the trans-dominant effect of the RNA. CUG-BP was found to bind to the human cardiac troponin T (cTNT) pre–messenger RNA and regulate its alternative splicing. Splicing of cTNT was disrupted in DM striated muscle and in normal cells expressing transcripts that contain CUG repeats. Altered expression of genes regulated posttranscriptionally by CUG-BP therefore may contribute to DM pathogenesis."

The present research shows that superoxide is produced by mitochondria isolated from apoptotic cells due to a switch from the normal 4-electron reduction of O2 to a 1-electron reduction when cytochromec is released from mitochondria. Bcl-2, a protein that protects against apoptosis and blocks cytochrome c release, prevents superoxide production when it is overexpressed. The switch in electron transfer provides a mechanism for redox signaling that is concomitant with cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspases. The block of cytochrome c release provides a mechanism for the apparent antioxidant function of Bcl-2. Activation of apoptosis is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species.

Studies with TNFα and ceramide have shown that these agents activated ROS generation by mitochondria (7Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol.

The recent proposed model of p53-induced apoptosis also placed ROS as a central signaling event (10Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Voglestein B.

Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), can block or delay apoptosis. On the other hand, ROS can provide protective mechanisms under some conditions, such as the activation of NFκB by TNF-induced ROS production (15Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10057-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 16Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). Thus ROS, and the resulting cellular redox change, can be part of the signal transduction pathway during apoptosis. Yet the mechanisms of ROS generation and its relationship with the well studied caspase activation have not been resolved.A role of ROS during apoptosis was initially proposed based upon the observation that Bcl-2, a general inhibitor of apoptosis in mammalian cells, has an apparent antioxidant function (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliiman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 18Kane D.J. Sarafian R. Anton H. Butler G.J. Selverstone V.T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is largely localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, and when overexpressed, it protects cells from lipid peroxidation and thiol oxidation induced by menadione and hydrogen peroxide (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliiman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 18Kane D.J. Sarafian R. Anton H. Butler G.J. Selverstone V.T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 also protects ρ0 cells from apoptosis under conditions that ROS generation is limited (19Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 20Shimizu S.Y. Eguchl H. Kosaka W. Kamiike H. Masuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Thus, its anti-apoptotic function is not limited to the antioxidant property. Nonetheless, this apparent antioxidant property of Bcl-2 has not been explained.When human myeloid leukemia HL 60 and U-937 cells undergo apoptosis induced by staurosporine (21Yang J. Liu X.

Liu L. Fang G. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3115-3120PubMed Google Scholar), and ionizing radiation (23Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schefield L. Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z-M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6932-6942Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar), there is an early release of cyt c from mitochondria, and the released cyt c participates in the activation of caspase 3. Bcl-2 family proteins prevent cyt c from entering the cytosol either by blocking cyt c release (21Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar, 22Kim C.N. Wang X. Huang Y. Ibrado A.M. Liu L. Fang G. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3115-3120PubMed Google Scholar) or by binding directly with cyt c (23Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schefield L. Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z-M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6932-6942Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cyt c is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. A variety of mitochondrial poisons are well known to stimulate ROS generation by a mechanism that involves inhibition of electron transfer, accumulation of reducing equivalents in the middle portion of the electron transfer chain, and direct one-electron transfer to O2 to produce superoxide (for review, see Ref. 24Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This switch appears to occur principally at the level of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone/ubiquinol) and thus could also occur as a consequence of cyt c loss.In this study, we used staurosporine-treated HL 60 cells to study the mechanism of ROS generation during apoptosis. Results show that the cellular redox change occurred following mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and was in parallel to the caspase activation. The release of cytochrome c was associated with inhibited mitochondrial respiration and stimulated mitochondrial superoxide production, and overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibited all of these processes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether an oxidant signal precedes or follows mitochondrial release of cyt c, we measured the redox state of the intracellular GSH pool as a function of time following treatment of neo cells with 1 μm staurosporine (Fig.1). Under these conditions, cytc release was detectable already at 1 h (Fig.1 B), but oxidation of cellular GSH/GSSG did not occur until after 2 h (Fig. 1 A). By 6 h, the redox potentialEh was oxidized by 72 mV (from −239 ± 6 to −167 ± 9 mV), a change similar to the 86 mV oxidation in apoptotic HT29 cells (data not shown). In cells overexpressing Bcl-2, cyt c release was blocked (Fig. 1 B), and the redox change was inhibited (Fig. 1 A). The measured mitochondrial GSH/GSSG ratio changed with a similar time course (Fig.1 A, inset). Thus, cyt c loss preceded the generation of an oxidant signal and as previously reported, Bcl-2 blocked cyt c release (21Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar) and had an apparent antioxidant function (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliiman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 18Kane D.J. Sarafian R. Anton H. Butler G.J. Selverstone V.T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), as measured by Eh of the GSH/GSSG pool and the mitochondrial GSH/GSSG ratio.Antioxidants, such as NAC, can inhibit apoptosis in some systems (12Mayer M. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7496-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Although the staurosporine-induced caspase activation and subsequent DNA fragmentation could be completely inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2, they were not sensitive to NAC (Fig. 1 C). Thus in staurosporine-induced apo-ptosis, the caspase activation seems to be redox-insensitive, and the effects of Bcl-2 cannot be attributed to its apparent antioxidant function.Because the redox signal was not observed until after cyt crelease, we then examined whether the mitochondrion is a possible source of the redox signal. For this, we used DHR, a non-fluorescent compound that accumulates in the mitochondria and can be oxidized to the fluorescent rhodamine (33Rothe G. Emmendorffer A. Oser A. Roesler J. Valet G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 138: 133-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). FACScan showed that DHR was oxidized in staurosporine-treated neo cells but not in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Confocal microscopy confirmed that this fluorescence was mainly localized to the mitochondria, together with the mtΔψ-driven dye DiOC6 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the results suggest that ROS may be generated in the mitochondria upon cyt c release and that this is prevented by Bcl-2 in association with its inhibition of cyt c release.Babior and co-workers (30Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34Adachi S. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Gottlieb R.A. J.

Measurements in mitochondria of neo cells treated with staurosporine also showed that substrate-stimulated O2 consumption was inhibited (Fig.3 A). Thus, the loss of cytc is associated with an interruption of normal electron flow that could divert electron transfer to the generation of superoxide.Figure 3Mitochondrial functional change as a consequence of staurosporine treatment.

Marzo I. Kroemer G. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and this could also contribute to cyt c release (data not shown) and superoxide production (36Backway K.L. McCulloch E.A. Chow S. Hedley D.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2446-2451PubMed Google Scholar, 37Marchetti P. Decaudin D. Macho A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MPT had occurred in neo cells treated with staurosporine, we used FACS analysis with rhodamine 123 or DiOC6. Results showed that Δψ was largely retained under conditions where cytc was released and the redox signal was generated (Fig. 3,B and C). At later times, the Δψ was lost (Ref. 21Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar and data not shown), indicating that the redox change preceded the MPT and was not a result of MPT.To determine whether mitochondria that have lost cyt cduring apoptotic signaling have increased substrate-dependent superoxide production, we measured stimulated superoxide production in mitochondria isolated from staurosporine-treated cells. Results showed that superoxide generation was enhanced in mitochondria isolated from staurosporine-treated neo cells. By 4 h, the rate was 5.28 ± 0.33 nmol/mg protein per min (Fig. 4 A). This was dependent upon respiratory substrate and was inhibited by superoxide dismutase.Figure 4Measurement of superoxide generation in isolated mitochondria from neo (A) and bcl-2 (B) cells. Mitochondria were isolated with digitonin-nagarse treatment. Measurements were performed in a SLM/Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SOD, treated with 1 μm staurosporine for 4 h and with 100 units of bovine erythrocyte SOD in the reaction buffer. Results are representative ones from four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether superoxide production could be blocked by preventing cytochrome c release, superoxide production by mitochondria from staurosporine-treated bcl-2 cells was measured. Results showed that mitochondria from cells overexpressing Bcl-2 had no increase in superoxide production following staurosporine treatment (Fig. 4 B). Addition of cyanide, a direct mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor, resulted in superoxide generation in mitochondria from Bcl-2-overexpressing cells at a rate similar to that from neo cells. Thus, the results show that the effect of Bcl-2 was not due to a direct electron-scavenging or superoxide-metabolizing activity of Bcl-2 itself but rather to the prevention of O⨪2production.These observations demonstrate that the antioxidant activity of Bcl-2 is indirect and clarify an important issue concerning Bcl-2 function. However, this finding also raises a fundamental question about the redox signaling in cells. The redox state of the GSH/GSSG pool is substantially oxidized (−239 mV) compared with the NADPH pool (−394 mV) (38Sies H. Sies H. Metabolic Compartmentation. Academic Press, London1982: 205-231Google Scholar) that drives GSSG reduction. If the steady stateEh of GSH/GSSG reflects a balance between the rate of GSH oxidation by mitochondrially derived oxidants (e.g. superoxide and H2O2) and the rate of GSSG reduction by NADPH, then it places Bcl-2 at a pivotal point in regulation of the cellular thiol disulfide redox state by controlling the rate of mitochondrial generation of ROS (Fig. 5).Figure 5Hypothetical reaction scheme for Bcl-2-dependent control of the cellular thiol-disulfide redox state. The GSH/GSSG redox state represents a kinetic balance between the rates of GSH oxidation (GPx-GSH peroxidase) and GSSG reduction (GRx-GSSG reductase). The balance of electron flow through cytochrome oxidase to produce H2O compared with transfer to O2 to generate O⨪2 is controlled by the cytochromec content in the intermembrane space. By controlling cytc loss from mitochondria, Bcl-2 can alter the cytosolic GSH/GSSG redox state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The present demonstration of a mechanism for ROS generation during apoptosis does not resolve whether ROS has a role in apoptosis signaling. Despite the fact that an oxidant signal occurs during apoptosis by diverse stimuli, so far the available pieces of evidence suggest that caspase activation is irrelevant to the redox state.In vitro data using cell-free systems indicated that caspase 3 activation was independent of the redox state of cyt c(39Kluck R.M. Martin S.J. Hoffman B.M. Zhou J.S. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4639-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 40Hampton M.B. Zhivotovsky B. Slater A.F.G. Burgess D.H. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Similarly, when we added 5 mm NAC to the neo cells, we obtained no inhibition of caspase activation, as measured by DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 C) and phosphatidylserine translocation (data not shown). Thus when ROS is generated concomitantly with a direct activating mechanism of caspases, it might be only a side effect that is unrelated to the key signaling events leading to the caspase-executed cell death.However, a range of other possible functions for ROS could exist beyond the activation of death proteases. Caspases are inhibited by oxidants (41Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS. Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 42Nobel C.S. Burgess D.H. Zhivotovsky B. Burkitt M.J. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 10: 636-643Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The superoxide generated could function as a mechanism to inactivate caspases and prevent their destruction of cells that phagocytose apoptotic bodies (41Hampton M.B. Orrenius S. FEBS. Lett. 1997; 414: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). ROS may also counteract the lethal effects of caspases in non-apoptotic cells. Caspase 3 has recently been found to function in the processing of pro-interleukin 16, a non-apoptotic function that would appear to require some low level of constitutive activation (43Zhang Y. Center D.M. Wu M.H. Cruikshank W.W. Yuan J. Andrews D.W. Kornfeld H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). If low levels of cyt c release are involved in this process, a concomitant superoxide signal may activate protective mechanisms, such as the activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-κB (44Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar, 45Liu Z.-G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Michael K. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In TNF-α-induced apoptosis, NF-κB has been shown to control the expression of several protective genes, such as c-IAP2 and MnSOD (13Iwata S. Hori T. Sata N. Hirota K. Sasada T. Mitsui A. Hirakawa T. Yodoi J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3108-3117PubMed Google Scholar,14Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Despite the phosphorylation of I-κB, the intracellular redox state is known to be another regulatory mechanism of NF-κB (46Staal F.J. Roederer M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9943-9947Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar).Alternatively, the switch of mitochondrial electron transport from its normal pathway through cyt c, which does not result in free radical production, to one in which electrons are transferred to O2 with production of superoxide, may provide a fail-safe mechanism that complements cyt c-dependent caspase activation for the execution of cell death. The dramatic 75-mV oxidation of the cellular GSH/GSSG pool (Fig. 1 A) is a sufficient signal to result in a 500-fold change in the function of systems regulated by vicinal dithiols with Eo in an appropriate range (47Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, global oxidation due to the electron transfer switch triggered by cyt c release could provide a general backup mechanism for a redox-activated molecular machinery of apoptosis. One example of such a mechanism could be the activation of MPT. The MPT pore has critical thiols, which upon oxidation can trigger its opening (48Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar) and release the apoptosis-inducing factor (35Hrish T. Marzo I. Kroemer G. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 49Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsh T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Although not purified yet, apoptosis-inducing factor seems also to be a cysteine protease and can induce nuclear apoptosis in cell-free systems. Oxidants, such as diamide andtert-butylhydroperoxide, can induce its release from isolated mitochondria (49Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsh T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M.

The time course of mtΔψ change (Fig. 3) indicated that MPT does not contribute significantly to the generation of superoxide in staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HL 60 cells, but rather superoxide production may subsequently activate the MPT in a final common pathway of cell death.

Studies with TNFα and ceramide have shown that these agents activated ROS generation by mitochondria (7Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol.

The recent proposed model of p53-induced apoptosis also placed ROS as a central signaling event (10Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Voglestein B.

Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), can block or delay apoptosis. On the other hand, ROS can provide protective mechanisms under some conditions, such as the activation of NFκB by TNF-induced ROS production (15Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). Thus ROS, and the resulting cellular redox change, can be part of the signal transduction pathway during apoptosis. Yet the mechanisms of ROS generation and its relationship with the well studied caspase activation have not been resolved. A role of ROS during apoptosis was initially proposed based upon the observation that Bcl-2, a general inhibitor of apoptosis in mammalian cells, has an apparent antioxidant function (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliiman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 18Kane D.J. Sarafian R. Anton H. Butler G.J. Selverstone V.T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is largely localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, and when overexpressed, it protects cells from lipid peroxidation and thiol oxidation induced by menadione and hydrogen peroxide (17Hockenbery D.M. Oltvai Z.N. Yin X.M. Milliiman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 18Kane D.J. Sarafian R. Anton H. Butler G.J. Selverstone V.T. Bredesen D.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 also protects ρ0 cells from apoptosis under conditions that ROS generation is limited (19Jacobson M.D. Burne J.F. King M.P. Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Raff M.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 20Shimizu S.Y. Eguchl H. Kosaka W. Kamiike H. Masuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1995; 374: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Thus, its anti-apoptotic function is not limited to the antioxidant property. Nonetheless, this apparent antioxidant property of Bcl-2 has not been explained. When human myeloid leukemia HL 60 and U-937 cells undergo apoptosis induced by staurosporine (21Yang J. Liu X.

Missense mutations in ACTC that cosegregate with IDC were identified in two unrelated families. Both mutations affect universally conserved amino acids in domains of actin that attach to Z bands and intercalated discs. Coupled with previous data showing that dystrophin mutations also cause dilated cardiomyopathy, these results raise the possibility that defective transmission of force in cardiac myocytes is a mechanism underlying heart failure."

This within-lineage effect is not a sampling bias. It persists throughout the Cenozoic, accounting for the gradual overall increase in average mass (Cope's rule). The effect is stronger for larger mammals, being near zero for small mammals. This variation partially explains the unwavering lower size limit and the gradually expanding mid-sized gap, but not the sudden large increase in the upper size limit, at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary."

Here it is shown that in cells lacking Ku, a heterodimeric protein involved in nonhomologous DNA end joining, these overhangs are present throughout the cell cycle. In vivo cross-linking experiments demonstrated that Ku is bound to telomeric DNA. These results show that Ku plays a direct role in establishing a normal DNA end structure on yeast chromosomes, conceivably by functioning as a terminus-binding factor. Because Ku-mediated DNA end joining involving telomeres would result in chromosome instability, our data also suggest that Ku has a distinct function when bound to telomeres."

High-affinity trivalent binding and monovalent binding are fundamentally different. In trivalent (and more generally, polyvalent) binding, dissociation occurs in stages, and its rate can be accelerated by monovalent ligand at sufficiently high concentrations. In monovalent binding, dissociation is determined solely by the rate constant for dissociation and cannot be accelerated by added monomer. Calorimetric measurements for the trivalent system indicate an approximately additive gain in enthalpy relative to the corresponding monomers. This system is one of the most stable organic receptor-ligand pairs involving small molecules that is known. It illustrates the practicality of designing very high-affinity systems based on polyvalency."

This protein, which we called ARL-1, consists of 316 amino acids, the same size as AR, and its amino acid sequence is 71% identical to that of AR. It is more closely related to the AR-like proteins such as mouse vas deferens protein, fibroblast growth factor-regulated protein, and Chinese hamster ovary reductase, with 81, 82, and 83%, respectively, of its amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of these proteins.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There are strong indications that it is involved in diabetic complications (2Kinoshita J.H. Nishimura C. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1988; 4: 323-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, its physiological function is not entirely clear. It is quite abundant in the epithelial cells lining the collecting tubules in the renal medullar. Since hyperosmotic stress can induce the transcription of AR, followed by the accumulation of sorbitol to a level that can affect intracellular osmotic pressure, it was proposed that AR may be involved in the osmoregulation in the kidney (3Garcia-Perez A. Martin B. Murphy H.R. Uchida S. Murer H. Cowley Jr., B.D. Handler J.S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the seminal vesicles, AR may be involved in the production of fructose that is abundant in the semen because sorbitol can be converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase (1Hers H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Besides kidney and testes, AR is present in many other tissues where its function is not clear. Interestingly, glucose is not its preferred substrate (K m = 100 mm,k cat/K m = 2.8 × 102m−1 min−1) (5Wermuth B. Burgisser H. Bohren K. Von Wartburg J-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is more efficient in reducing various aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes including glyceraldehyde, benzaldehyde, pyridine aldehyde etc. (6Inazu N. Nagashima Y. Satoh T. Fuji T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In particular, AR's ability to reduce methylglyoxal (K m = 7.8 μm,k cat/K m = 1.8 × 107m−1 min−1) (7Vander Jagt D.L. Robinson B. Taylor K.K. Hunsaker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a toxic byproduct of glucose metabolism, and 4-hydroxynonenal (K m = 22 μm,k cat/K m = 4.6 × 106m−1 min−1) (8Vander Jagt D.L.

Acta. 1995; 1249: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), a toxic lipid aldehyde produced during oxidative stress, suggests that it may be responsible for detoxifying these and other harmful aldehydes generated by cellular metabolism. A previous report showed that AR is induced in rat hepatoma (9Takahashi M. Fujii J. Miyoshi E. Hoshi A. Taniguch N. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and suggested that it may be essential for detoxifying harmful metabolites produced by fast growing cancer cells. In another report, partial sequence determination of a protein induced in rat hepatoma called Spot 17, showed that it is highly homologous to the rat AR (10Zeindl-Eberhart E. Jungblut P.R. Otto A. Rabes H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14589-14594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were interested in seeing if the AR and AR-like genes are also overexpressed in human liver cancers and contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. We found that about 29% of the liver cancers overexpressed AR, and about 54% of them overexpressed a novel aldose reductase-like gene. We cloned the cDNA of this gene, and sequence analysis showed that the amino acid sequence of this protein we called ARL-1 is 71% identical to that of AR. As a first step toward understanding the function of ARL-1, we determined its sites of expression and also expressed its cDNA in Escherichia coli to obtain protein for the analysis of its enzymatic activities. Since this enzyme is highly homologous to the much better characterized AR, in this study we compared its enzymatic characteristics and its substrate specificity with that of AR. Liver cancers were diagnosed by computerized tomography or ultrasonography and confirmed postoperationally by histological examination. After surgical operation, part of the liver cancer and some surrounding nontumorous tissues were collected for RNA extraction. These samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction. RNA was extracted by a modification of the protocol of Auffray and Rougeon (11Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). Frozen tissues were placed in buffer containing 3 m LiCl, 6 m urea solution and homogenized with POLYTRONTM homogenizer (Kinematic, Lucerne, Switzerland) for 1–2 min with a 30-s interval with the tubes kept on ice. The homogenate was kept at 4 °C overnight, and then the RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed twice with the 3 m LiCl, 6 m urea solution, drained, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of TE buffer containing 0.5% SDS and 200 μg of proteinase K. The resuspensions were incubated at 37 °C for 30–60 min. RNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) and precipitated with 110 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol at −20 °C for 2 h. The mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g, 4 °C, and the RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated distilled water. The amount of RNA was estimated by measuring the absorption at 260 nm. 20 μg of total RNA was loaded onto each lane of a 1.2% agarose gel containing 3% formaldehyde. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham International plc, Buckinghamshire, UK) by capillary blotting in 20× SSC (3 mNaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate) buffer. Membranes containing RNA from various adult and fetal human tissues were purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). They contained 2 μg of mRNA from each tissue. For standard hybridization, the membranes were first incubated with prehybridization buffer (7% SDS, 0.25 m sodiumo-phosphoric acid; manufacturer's protocol) at 65 °C for 1–2 h and then changed to hybridization buffer complemented with α-32P-labeled cDNA probes and then incubated at 65 °C for 12 h. The 3′-untranslated region of AR (MscI cut at nucleotide 1109 to the end, 1366, of AR cDNA; Ref. 11Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) and ARL-1 (polymerase chain reaction-amplified product nucleotide 1020–1300, GenBankTM accession number HARL U37100) were used as probes. The sequence identity between these two probes is less than 10%. After hybridization, the filters were briefly washed twice with a solution of 0.1× SSC and 0.5% SDS at room temperature and twice in the same solution for 30 min each at 65 °C. The radioactivity on the membranes was quantitated and visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and also exposed to x-ray film (X-MATTM AR, Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C with intensifying screens for a better quality image. The procedures were essentially the same for reduced stringency hybridization except that hybridization was done at 50 °C, and the membranes were washed in 0.5× SSC and 0.5% SDS at 50 °C. Poly(A) RNA was purified from about 750 μg of total RNA from the human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimen and used to construct the cDNA library with unidirectional ZAP ExpressTM/EcoRI/XhoI vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's protocols. In the primary screening, duplicate plaque lifts were first hybridized with 32P-labeled human AR cDNA (12Chung S. LaMendola J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14775-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 50 °C in a solution of 7% SDS, 0.25 m sodium o-phosphoric acid. 1 × 109 cpm of 32P-labeled probe per 40 ml of hybridization solution was used. After hybridization, the membranes were washed at 50 °C in 0.5× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 1 h. The membrane filters were then exposed to x-ray film. After exposure, the filters were washed at 60 °C with 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS and reexposed to x-ray film. Plaques that showed a positive hybridization signal on duplicate filters with the signal disappearing after the 60 °C wash were selected for further analysis. These were eluted and plated on 80-mm plates to obtain well isolated plaques. These plaques were rescreened with radioactively labeled human AR cDNA as above. Three clones were isolated after the second round of screening. These three phages were used to infect bacteria XPORT along with helper phage and plated on a lawn of XLOLR bacteria according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The phagemid DNA portions excised by the helper phage from the phage vector DNA were propagated as plasmids in XLOLR for further analysis. The nucleotide sequence at both ends of the clones were determined by dideoxy chain termination sequencing method (FMOLTM DNA Sequencing System, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using the T3 and T7 universal primers. From the sequence information, other oligonucleotides were synthesized to serve as primers to determine the remaining sequence. Both strands of the longest clone pCDL3 were sequenced at least once. AR and ARL-1 cDNA were inserted into the E. coli expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) such that their proteins would be translated in frame from the vector's translation start site. The plasmid DNA was then transfected into bacteria host M15. Induction of expression of the cDNA inserts and purification of the recombinant proteins were done according to the manufacturer's manual. Briefly, bacteria grown toA 600 = 0.8 were induced by 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation to remove debris, the supernatant was mixed with a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, which binds to the 6 histidine residues at the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. The slurry was then loaded onto a column and eluted with 0–0.5 mimidazole wash buffer. One-ml fractions were collected, and samples from each column were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled, dialyzed, and stored at −20 °C. The standard reaction mixture for AR was 135 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), 0.2 mmNADPH, 0.3 m lithium sulfate, 0.5–2.5 μg of enzyme with the appropriate amount of substrate as indicated in Table II. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C, and the decrease in NADPH was monitored by spectrophotometer at 340 nm. Enzyme activity was calculated as the amount of NADPH oxidized/min/μg of protein. Reaction conditions for ARL-1 were the same except that the phosphate buffer was pH 7.0. For the determination of pH optima and the effect of chloride and sulfate ions on enzymatic activity, 4 mmdl-glyceraldehyde was used as substrate.Table IISubstrate specificity of AR and ARL-1SubstratesConcentrationARARL-1mmnmol/min/mgProstaglandin E20.2ND2-aND, the activity was undetectable or less than 32 nmol/min/mg.NDCortisone0.1NDND5α-Dihydrocortisol0.164ND17α-Hydroylprogesterone0.1NDNDProgesterone0.1NDNDMenadione0.2NDNDPhenanthrenequinone0.2NDND4-Nitroacetanilide0.25NDNDm-Nitrobenzaldehyde0.256242426o-Nitrobenzaldehyde0.252972213p-Nitrobenzaldehyde0.2576044804-Carboxybenzaldehyde0.25748535Pyridine-3-aldehyde4.06324645Pyridine-4-aldehyde4.061231482-Benzoylpyridine4.032535Methylglyoxal20.09427458Diacetyl20.04904877Pyruvic acid20.0NDNDdl-Glyceraldehyde20.012521929d-Glucuronate20.043296d-Glucose20.012965d-Galactose20.019365Xylose20.0348322-a ND, the activity was undetectable or less than 32 nmol/min/mg. Open table in a new tab To see if AR is induced in human liver cancer, we used AR cDNA to probe Northern blot containing RNA from the first two HCC tissues and the surrounding normal tissues from one of the HCCs we obtained (samples T1, T2, and N2 in Fig. 1). No overexpression ofAR was found, but when the hybridization and washing temperature was reduced, a RNA band larger than that of AR was found in HCC T2 (data not shown). RNA from HCC T2 was used as templates to construct a cDNA library where the 5′–3′ orientation of the cDNAs is defined (see “Materials and Methods”). Approximately 2 × 105 plaques were screened by hybridization using the human AR cDNA (12Chung S. LaMendola J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14775-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a probe. Plaques that hybridized under reduced stringency conditions and whose hybridization signal disappeared when rewashed under standard conditions were selected. After rescreening under the same conditions, three clones named pCDL1, pCDL2, and pCDL3 were isolated for further analysis. The plasmid DNAs containing the cDNAs were excised from the phage arms as described under “Materials and Methods,” and their cDNA inserts were released by digestion with restriction enzymes. The insert sizes of pCDL1, pCDL2, and pCDL3 were determined to be 0.68, 1.0, and 1.35 kilobases, respectively. The nucleotide sequences at both ends of these clones were determined, and the sequences at the 3′-end of these clones were found to be identical (data not shown), indicating that they are cDNAs of the same message. The sequences at the 5′-ends of these clones are highly homologous to the corresponding regions of AR cDNA (data not shown), suggesting that all three clones are cDNAs of a gene that is very similar in sequence to AR. We called this AR-like gene ARL-1. To confirm that the ARL-1 gene is the AR-like gene expressed in liver cancers and to survey a larger number of cancers, RNA from 24 HCC specimens and the surrounding normal tissues from 16 of these HCCs were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization under standard conditions using ARL-1 cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 1, 13 HCCs (T2, T3, T4, T11, T12, T14, T16, T18, T19, T20, T21, T23, and T24) contained higher levels of ARL-1 mRNA, indicating that about 54% of HCCs overexpress in the AR-like gene. The RNA blot was reprobed with labeled AR cDNA, and HCC samples T5, T7, T11, T14, T16, T22 and T23 were found to overexpress this gene (Fig. 1). None of the 24 HCCs tested overexpressed aldehyde reductase, an enzyme with 49.5% of its amino acids identical to AR (13Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The sequence of both strands of pCDL3, the longest clone of ARL-1, was determined and submitted to GenBankTM (HARL U37100). This clone contains 1337 base pairs (not counting the poly(A) tail). The first ATG codon at nucleotide 70 signals the beginning of an open reading frame coding for a protein of 316 amino acids, the same size as AR from human and other mammalian species studied (14Graham C. Szpirer C. Levan G. Carper D. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 107: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Gui T. Tanimoto T. Kokai Y. Nishimura C. Eur. J.

Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 462-465PubMed Google Scholar). The AATAAA sequence at position 1316 is most likely the polyadenylation signal, indicating that this clone contains the complete 3′-end of the ARL-1 mRNA. It is not clear whether it contains the entire 5′-untranslated sequence. The protein sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence shows that ARL-1 is 71% identical to that of human AR (12Chung S. LaMendola J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14775-14777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is more homologous to a group of AR-like proteins. Its amino acid sequence is 80, 82, and 83% identical to that of the mouse vas deferens protein (MVDP) (17Martinez A. Pailhoux E. Berger M. Jean C. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the mouse fibroblast growth factor-regulated protein (FR-1) (18Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) reductase (19Hyndman D.J. Takenoshita R. Vera N.L. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13286-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), respectively. Further, it is 94% identical to the partial sequence of Spot 17 in rat hepatomas (10Zeindl-Eberhart E. Jungblut P.R. Otto A. Rabes H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14589-14594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that it is most likely the human homologue of this protein. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of these proteins is shown in Fig. 2. ARL-1 is thus a new member of the structurally related family of proteins that includes aldehyde reductase (13Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine prostaglandin F synthase (16Watanabe K. Fujii Y. Nakayama K. Ohkubo H. Kuramitsu S. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Nakanishi S. Hayaishi O. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 462-465PubMed Google Scholar), frog lens ρ-crystallin (20Carper D. Nishimura C. Shinohara T. Dietzchold B. Wistow G. Craft C. Kador P. Kinoshita J.H. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and many others (21Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To determine the sites of gene expression of ARL-1 in normal tissues, RNA from 16 adult and four fetal organs were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. AR was also included in this survey for comparison and also because there was no systematic study of its expression at the RNA level in humans. As shown in Fig.3, ARL-1 is not expressed in many tissues. Its message is most abundant in the small intestines and the colon, and a low level of its mRNA is found in the liver, thymus, prostate, testis, and skeletal muscle. No ARL-1 mRNA is detected in the four fetal tissues tested. AR, on the other hand, is expressed in all tissues tested. In the adult, AR message is most abundant in the prostate, testis, skeletal muscle, and the heart; substantial amounts are found in the ovary, small intestines, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, and the placenta; lower levels are found in the brain, lung, leukocytes, and the pancreas; a trace amount is found in the liver. Of the four fetal tissues tested, AR mRNA is most abundant in the kidney, a substantial amount is found in the brain, and a low level is found in the lung and liver. Since ARL-1 is highly homologous to well characterized AR, we wanted to compare its enzymatic activities with this enzyme. The cDNAs of these two genes were expressed in E. coli as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the purified recombinant proteins were used for enzyme assays. Preliminary experiments showed that ARL-1 is active in reducingdl-glyceraldehyde, and it was used as a substrate to optimize enzymatic condition. The optimum pH for AR and ARL-1 was found to be 6.2 and 7.0, respectively (Fig. 4). As reported for AR from tissues, recombinant AR is stimulated by ammonium sulfate and lithium sulfate and not affected by ammonium chloride (22Sheaff C.M. Doughty C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2696-2702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of ARL-1, on the other hand, was not affected by any of these salts (TableI).Table IEffect of chloride and sulfate ions on AR and ARL-1 activitiesSaltRelative activityARARL-1%None100.0100.00.3m (NH4)2SO4192.7110.50.3 m Li2SO4227.7102.60.3m Na2SO4171.4101.40.3m NH4Cl93.1125.30.3 mNaCl81.9105.8 Open table in a new tab Using their respective optimum assay conditions, the abilities of AR and ARL-1 to reduce various substrates were tested, and the result is shown in Table II. Similar to the AR purified from tissues, recombinant AR can reduce aromatic aldehydes such as nitrobenzaldehyde and carboxybenzaldehyde; aliphatic aldehydes such as methylglyoxal and diacetyl; pyridine aldehydes; glyceraldehyde; and hexoses. Steroids and quinones were poor substrates for AR. The spectrum of substrates that ARL-1 can reduce is very similar to that of AR. The kinetics of these two enzymes in reducing some of these substrates was further analyzed. The results, shown in TableIII, indicate that the two enzymes have very similar enzymatic activities over a range of substrates. The kinetic constants for AR and ARL-1 were determined in the presence of 0.3 m lithium sulfate. Under this condition, theK m values of AR for glyceraldehyde, glucose, methylglyoxal, and glucuronate are, respectively, 4.8-, 1-, 3-, and 0.7-fold of the K m of human AR determined in the absence of sulfate (23Vander Jagt D.L. Torres J.E. Hunsaker L.A. Deek L.M. Royer R.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 414: 491-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the k cat values for these substrates are, respectively, 6-, 1.7-, 6-, and 4-fold of that determined without lithium sulfate.Table IIIKinetic constants for AR, ARL-1, and CHO reductaseSubstratesARARL-1CHO3-aThe kinetic constants for CHO reductase are taken from Ref. 19.KmkcatKmkcatKmkcatmmmin−1mmmin−1mmmin−1m-Nitrobenzaldehyde0.0143430.01821280.0153-bThe kinetic constants are forp-nitrobenzaldehyde.2723-bThe kinetic constants are forp-nitrobenzaldehyde.4-carboxybenzaldehyde0.0124370.031 382Pyridine-3-aldehyde0.0026180.00123040.065221BenzoylpyridineND3-cNot detectable.1.422Methylglyoxal0.0248460.1325340.6176Diacetyl0.125861.182225dl-Glyceraldehyde0.0777191.86190328.0 61dl-Glucuronate1.93120.15268d-Glucose69.010952.0 110d-Galactose21.022234.0683-a The kinetic constants for CHO reductase are taken from Ref. 19Hyndman D.J.

Open table in a new tab We have identified a novel protein that is a member of the growing family of structurally related aldo-keto reductases (21Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The sequence of this protein called ARL-1 is 71% identical to that of aldose reductase, and together with aldose reductases from other organisms, it belongs to the AKR1B group of aldo-keto reductases according to the new nomenclature system for these proteins (24Jez J.M. Flynn T.G. Penning T.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). ARL-1 is more closely related to MVDP (17Martinez A. Pailhoux E. Berger M. Jean C. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and FR-1 (18Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the recently identified Chinese hamster protein, the CHO reductase (19Hyndman D.J. Takenoshita R. Vera N.L. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13286-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these four proteins are about 80–90% identical to each other. They form a distinct subgroup within the AKR1B group because they are about 70% identical to the aldose reductase from various mammalian organisms, which share about 80% sequence identity with each other. Among these four AR-like proteins, MVDP is unique in that its gene is primarily expressed in the vas deferens and the adrenal gland (17Martinez A. Pailhoux E. Berger M. Jean C. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Lau E.T. Cao D. Lin C. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using Northern blot analysis, we found that ARL-1 mRNA is not present in human vas deferens (data not shown). This indicates that the physiological functions of MVDP and ARL-1 are quite different. ARL-1 is more closely related to FR-1 in terms of sequence homology and sites of gene expression. Similar to ARL-1, FR-1 is also expressed quite strongly in the small intestines, but it differs from ARL-1 in that its mRNA is quite abundant in the ovary and testis, with lower levels in the brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, skin, and spleen (18Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Hampton B.S. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8604-8609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that FR-1 also differs from ARL-1 in that it is expressed in fetal liver, while ARL-1 is not. However, this could be due to the fact that the fetal RNA samples of these two organisms may be taken from fetuses at different stages of development. Interestingly, although CHO reductase and FR-1 are 93% identical to each other, there are similarities as well as major differences in the sites of their gene expression. CHO reductase mRNA is quite abundant in the urinary bladder and the jejunum, which, unfortunately, had not been screened for FR-1 expression. Both genes are expressed in the testis and the ovary. However, CHO reductase mRNA is not detectable in brain, heart, liver, kidney, and muscle, where FR-1 mRNA is found (19Hyndman D.J. Takenoshita R. Vera N.L. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13286-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This family of aldo-keto reductases have broad range of substrate specificity. They probably participate in a number of physiological functions depending on the type of cells and tissues in which they are located. Although AR and ARL-1 have similar enzymatic activities, the difference in the site of expression of the genes for these two proteins suggests that they may have different physiological functions. AR is quite abundant in kidney and testis, where it is thought to be involved in osmoregulation (3Garcia-Perez A. Martin B. Murphy H.R. Uchida S. Murer H. Cowley Jr., B.D. Handler J.S. Burg M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fructose synthesis (1Hers H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 22: 202-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), respectively. AR is also found in many other tissues, where its function is not clear. Judging from its ability to reduce a number of cytotoxic aldehydes, it has been proposed that AR may serve as a detoxification enzyme to eliminate harmful aldehydes generated by cellular metabolism (7Vander Jagt D.L. Robinson B. Taylor K.K. Hunsaker L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4364-4369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vander Jagt D.L. Kolb N.S. Vander Jagt T.J. Chino J. Martinez F.J. Hunsaker L.A. Royer R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1249: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Since ARL-1 is predominantly found in the small intestines and in the colon, it is likely to be responsible for inactivating toxic aldehydes in digested food before the nutrients are transported to other organs. We found that the enzymatic activity of ARL-1 is very similar to that of the well characterized human AR. This is not surprising, because not only is 71% of its amino acid sequence identical to that of AR but all of the key amino acids proposed to be responsible for AR's enzymatic activities are conserved in this protein. They include Ser159, Asn160, Gln183, and Lys262 for cofactor NADPH binding, Tyr48 and His110 as potential hydrogen donors, and active site residues Lys77, Tyr209, and Cys298(26Bohren K.M. Page J.L.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2021-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These two proteins differ from each other in terms of pH optimum, salt requirement, and kinetics in reducing some of these substrates. Sulfate ion had been shown to increase the maximum velocity and K m of aldose reductase fordl-glyceraldehyde (31Hayman S. Kinoshita J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 877-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it interacts with the catalytic site or affects the conformation of the catalytic site. The activity of ARL-1, on the other hand, was not affected by 0.3m sulfate ion, the optimum concentration for stimulating AR activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that sulfate ion may have a stimulatory effect on ARL-1 at lower concentrations. Cysteine 298 in AR is thought to be involved in sulfate activation (29Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This amino acid is conserved in ARL-1, suggesting that this is not the only amino acid involved in sulfate stimulation in AR. Comparative analysis of the structure and enzymatic properties of these proteins should be helpful to our understanding of the structure-function relationship of these proteins. Although CHO reductase is more homologous to ARL-1 than to AR, itsk cat values for various substrates are more similar to those of AR than to ARL-1 (Table III). It is interesting to note that CHO reductase and FR-1, which are 93% identical to each other, have very different kinetic constants towarddl-glyceraldehyde, the only substrate that has been studied for FR-1. The K m of FR-1 todl-glyceraldehyde is 0.92 mm (32Wilson D.K. Nakano T. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14323-14330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), while that for CHO reductase is 28 mm (19Hyndman D.J. Takenoshita R. Vera N.L. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13286-13291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The amino acids proposed to be involved in NADPH binding and catalysis for AR mentioned above are also conserved in FR-1 and CHO reductase, suggesting that small differences in other amino acid positions may contribute significantly to the conformation of the co-factor binding and catalytic sites. Comparing these small structural differences between these proteins will be helpful in elucidating the enzymatic mechanism of this class of enzymes. AR is thought to be a key enzyme in the etiology of diabetic complications such as cataract, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. At this point, it is not clear if ARL-1 also contributes to these diabetic complications. Although Northern blot analysis showed that it is not expressed in tissues prone to diabetic lesions, more detailed studies such as in situ hybridization analysis are necessary to see if it is expressed in a small population of cells within these tissues. If ARL-1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, it will be important to find AR inhibitors that would inhibit both AR and ARL-1. The binding site of an AR inhibitor, Zopolrestat, on FR-1 has been determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis of the AR inhibitor-enzyme complex (31Hayman S. Kinoshita J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 877-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Zopolrestat to FR-1 involves hydrophobic interaction with the amino acids Trp20, Tyr48, Trp79, Trp111, Phe122, Leu300, Met306, Tyr309, and Pro310. With the exception of Leu300 and Met306, which are replaced by Val and Leu, respectively, these amino acids are all conserved in ARL-1. Since the substituted amino acids are also hydrophobic, this suggests that Zopolrestat should also be effective in inhibiting ARL-1. This project was prompted by previous reports that showed that AR (9Takahashi M. Fujii J. Miyoshi E. Hoshi A. Taniguch N. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 62: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and an AR-like protein called Spot 17 (10Zeindl-Eberhart E. Jungblut P.R. Otto A. Rabes H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14589-14594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are induced in rat hepatomas, suggesting that these proteins may be needed to detoxify methylglyoxal or other metabolites generated by fast growing cancer cells. We looked at individual human HCCs and found that about 29% of them overexpressed AR and 54% of them overexpressed an AR-like gene we called ARL-1. The deduced protein sequence of ARL-1 is 94% identical to that of Spot 17, indicating that it is most likely the human homologue of that protein. Since not all HCCs overexpressed these genes and since there is no correlation between size of tumor and expression of these genes (data not shown), it is unlikely that they are essential for the growth of the cancer cells. In the rat studies, the analyses were done on a pool of liver tumors from a number of rats. Therefore, it is not clear if there are variations among individual hepatomas in the expression of these genes as we have observed in the human liver cancer. Since the rat hepatomas were induced by a single carcinogen, while human liver tumors were probably caused by different agents, comparing the pattern of expression of AR and AR-like genes in individual rat and human hepatomas may tell us whether or not the variations in the expression of these genes observed in human liver tumors are the result of different mechanisms of induction of these tumors. Serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts induces the expression of AR but not FR-1 (32Wilson D.K. Nakano T. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14323-14330Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, fibroblast growth factor stimulates the expression of FR-1 much more than AR (4Hsu D.K. Guo Y. Peifley K.A. Winkles J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating that the transcription of these two genes are induced by different growth factors. It is likely that the different liver cancers produce different growth factors or different amounts of these growth factors such that some of these cancers overexpress AR and some overexpress ARL-1. A better understanding of how these genes are induced in the liver cancers may help us unravel the pathogenesis of this deadly disease.

In this role, EF-Tu interacts with GTP, aminoacyl-tRNA, ribosomes, and a second protein factor, EF-Ts, which mediates GDP/GTP exchange on EF-Tu. Peptide bonds are formed by transfer of the nascent peptide from its tRNA at the peptidyl site to the α-amino group of the newly bound aminoacyl-tRNA at the aminoacyl site, and elongation factor EF-G allows translocation of ribosomes on the mRNA (1Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Pestka S. Weissbach H. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323-373Crossref Google Scholar, 2Brot N. Pestka S. Weissbach H. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 375-411Google Scholar). There is a high level of EF-Tu in Escherichia coli cells, comprising 5–10% total cell protein, in vast molar excess over the other essential protein components of the translation machinery (3Kurland C.G. Hughes D. Ehrenberg H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 979-1004Google Scholar). Several sets of results suggest that EF-Tu and its eukaryotic counterpart EF1α may have other functions in addition to the conventional role that they play in polypeptide elongation. EF-Tu is an essential host-donated subunit of the replicative complex of Qβ phage (4Blumenthal T. Landers T.A. Weber K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 75: 1313-1317Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and it may interact with the transcriptional apparatus as a positive regulator of RNA synthesis (5Travers A.A. Kamen R.I. Schleif R.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 748-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). EF-Tu is associated in part with the plasma membrane (6Jacobson G.R. Rosenbuch J.P. Nature. 1976; 261: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and is methylated in response to nutrient deprivation (7Young C.C. Behrnlohr R.W. J.

Molecular chaperones form a class of polypeptide-binding proteins that are implicated in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation or degradation after stress, and the control of protein-protein interactions. They can distinguish native proteins from their non-native forms, owing to the specificity of their peptide binding site, and they catalyze protein folding and renaturationin vitro (reviewed in Refs. 10Ellis R.J.

The major classes of bacterial chaperones comprise DnaK/Hsp70 (and its assistants DnaJ and GrpE), GroEL/Hsp60 (and its assistant GroES), HtpG/Hsp90, and the small heat shock proteins (10Ellis R.J.

In the present study, we show that elongation factor EF-Tu, in a manner similar to that of molecular chaperones, increases the refolding of unfolded proteins, protects proteins against thermal denaturation, and forms complexes with unfolded proteins. We propose that, in addition to its role in translational elongation, this overabundant protein might help in protein folding and renaturation in the cytoplasm. Citrate synthase (from porcine heart), α-glucosidase (from yeast), BPTI, R-CMLA, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, lysozyme, kirromycin, and all other chemicals were from Sigma and were reagent grade. DEAE-Sephacel and thiol-Sepharose resins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was from Bio-Rad. EF-Tu was purified by covalent chromatography on thiol-Sepharose. 2T. D. Caldas, A. El Yaagoubi, and G. Richarme submitted for publication. Crude extracts from the E. coli K12 strain C600 (leuB6 thi-1thr-1 supE44) were prepared by a lysozyme-EDTA method (13Cull M. McHenry C.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). EF-Tu was purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (column buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol; elution with a linear 0–0.35m NaCl gradient in the same buffer) followed by covalent chromatography on thiol-Sepharose (column buffer: 20 mmpotassium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0; elution with a gradient of 0–10 mm cysteine in the same buffer) and hydroxylapatite chromatography (column buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, elution with a linear 0–0.1 m gradient of potassium phosphate in the same buffer). The purified protein was dialyzed for 3 h against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Its 280/260-nm absorbancy was 1.25, indicating that it contains 0.9 equivalent of bound GDP (2Brot N. Pestka S. Weissbach H. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 375-411Google Scholar). EF-Tu was more than 98% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Unless otherwise indicated, we used this preparation of EF-Tu. DnaK was prepared as described previously (14Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol.

Raina S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2616-2624Crossref Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. O. Fayet, Microbiologie et Génétique Microbienne CNRS, Toulouse, France). Denaturation and renaturation reactions were carried out at 20 °C. For both proteins, renaturation was initiated by pouring the renaturation solvent on the unfolded protein under vortex agitation in Eppendorf polyethylene tubes. Citrate synthase was denatured at a concentration of 10 μm in 8 murea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.0, for 50 min. Renaturation was initiated by a 100-fold dilution in 40 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmpotassium acetate, pH 8.0. The enzymatic activity of citrate synthase was measured as described (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Glucosidase was denatured at a concentration of 1.5 μm in 8 m urea, 0.1m potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, for 15 min. Renaturation was initiated by a 30-fold dilution in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, at 20 °C. The enzymatic activity of α-glucosidase was measured as described (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The native enzyme (80 μm) was diluted 100-fold in 40 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2 mmpotassium acetate, pH 8.0, at 43 °C in the absence of added proteins or in the presence of DnaK or EF-Tu supplemented with 10 μm GDP (10 μm GDP was added in order to increase the thermal stability of EF-Tu (19Arai K. Kawarita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and did not modify citrate synthase aggregation). Citrate synthase aggregation was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm as described in (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For binding assays of R-CMLA and unfolded BPTI to EF-Tu and DnaK, gel permeation columns (Bio-Gel P-200 from Bio-Rad for studies with R-CMLA or Sephadex G-75 from Amersham for studies with BPTI, 300 μl bed volume each) were equilibrated with column buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2 for studies with R-CMLA and pH 7.4 for studies with BPTI), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reaction mixtures containing EF-Tu or DnaK and radiolabeled unfolded BPTI or radiolabeled R-CMLA at indicated concentrations were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C in column buffer without serum albumin and applied to the column at room temperature. Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 1 drop/fraction/30 s and counted for radioactivity. DnaK was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C before use. Unfolded BPTI was prepared as described previously from native BPTI (20Richarme G. Kohiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 32: 24074-24077Google Scholar). Unfolded BPTI, native BPTI, and R-CMLA were3H-labeled by reductive methylation (21Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). EF-Tu·GDP was formed by incubating EF-Tu (1–10 μm) in the presence of 20 μm GDP in citrate synthase or α-glucosidase renaturation buffers supplemented with 200 μmMgCl2. Because EF-Tu binds GDP much more tightly than GTP and since GDP always contaminates GTP preparations, EF-Tu·GTP was formed by incubating EF-Tu (1–10 μm) in the presence of 20 μm GTP, 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 10 μg of pyruvate kinase in citrate synthase or α-glucosidase renaturation buffers supplemented with 200 μmMgCl2 so as to recycle GDP into GTP (22Weissbach H. Lee Miller D. Hachmann J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). GDP, phosphoenolpyruvate or pyruvate kinase had no effect on substrate-protein renaturation. GTP had no effect on α-glucosidase renaturation but stimulated 1.7-fold citrate synthase renaturation, probably as an allosteric ligand of citrate synthase (23Hathaway J.A. Atkinson D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 20: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The assay was performed as described (24Wolf H. Chinali G. Parmeggiani A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μm kirromycin, except that GDP was separated from GTP by chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose (20Richarme G. Kohiyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 32: 24074-24077Google Scholar). 14C-Labeled GTP was from Amersham and was used at 1 Ci/mmol. The specific activities of EF-Tu in the absence and in the presence of kirromycin were similar to those reported by Wolf et al. (24Wolf H. Chinali G. Parmeggiani A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether EF-Tu acts as molecular chaperones in the folding of proteins. Citrate synthase and α-glucosidase, whose refolding is facilitated by several chaperones such as GroEL, DnaK, Hsp90, and small Hsps (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were chosen as substrates for this reaction. They were unfolded in the presence of 8m urea and allowed to refold upon dilution of the denaturant in the absence or in the presence of EF-Tu (protein folding in the presence of DnaK was studied in parallel). Under our experimental conditions, the refolding yield of 0.1 μmcitrate synthase was increased from 8% in the absence of added proteins to 30% in the presence of 3 μm EF-Tu and 33% in the presence of 3 μm DnaK (Fig.1 A). The dependence of citrate synthase reactivation on the concentration of EF-Tu is shown in Fig.1 B. The maximal recovery of citrate synthase activity attains 32% in the presence of 10 μm EF-Tu, and half-maximal reactivation occurs at 1 μm EF-Tu, a concentration similar to the concentration of DnaK (1 μm) required for half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase in similar conditions (not shown and Ref. 27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The EF-Tu concentration required for half-maximal reactivation of citrate synthase is somewhat higher than the concentration of citrate synthase but is impressively lower than the concentrations of EF-Tu in the cytoplasm (around 100 μm (28Weijland A. Harmark K. Cool R.H. Anborgh P.H. Parmeggiani A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). As reported previously (27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), other proteins such as ovalbumin and lysozyme were unable to stimulate citrate renaturation, whereas serum albumin could stimulate it to some extent. As shown in Fig. 2, the refolding of 0.05 μm α-glucosidase was increased from 8% in the absence of added protein to 24% in the presence of EF-Tu, and half-maximal reactivation of α-glucosidase occurs at 0.4 μm EF-Tu. In similar conditions, the refolding of α-glucosidase was 27% in the presence of 2 μm DnaK, and half-maximal reactivation of α-glucosidase occurred at 0.2 μm DnaK (data not shown). These results suggest that, like molecular chaperones, EF-Tu interacts with unfolded proteins, and increases their productive folding. We investigated the function of EF-Tu under heat shock conditions. As reported previously (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), citrate synthase loses its native conformation and undergoes aggregation during incubation at 43 °C. The addition of Ef-Tu (2 μm) or DnaK (2 μm) partially reduces citrate synthase (0.8 μm) aggregation, whereas both 5 μm DnaK and 5 μm EF-Tu suppress citrate synthase aggregation (Fig.3). In contrast, the addition of up to 35 μm bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, or lysozyme (not shown and Ref. 27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) does not protect citrate synthase against thermal aggregation. Thus, EF-Tu is nearly as efficient as DnaK and other chaperones (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U. Nature. 1992; 358: 169-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) in protecting citrate synthase from thermal denaturation and is much more efficient than other proteins such as bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, or lysozyme. Furthermore, the concentration of EF-Tu required for an efficient thermal protection of citrate synthase (around 5 μm) is approximately 20-fold lower than its cellular concentration. One characteristic of molecular chaperones is their preferential interaction with unfolded proteins (10Ellis R.J. Hemmingsen S.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 339-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 11Georgopoulos C. Liberek K. Zylicz M. Ang D. Morimoto R.I. Tissieres A. Georgopoulos C.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). R-CMLA, a permanently unfolded protein that maintains an extended conformation without any stable secondary structure in the absence of denaturant, strongly interacts with several chaperones, including DnaK (27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 383-392Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Complex formation between R-CMLA (20,000 Da) and EF-Tu (44,000 Da) was analyzed by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-200 column. When R-CMLA (2 μm) is filtered in the presence of EF-Tu (4 μm), 27% of R-CMLA fractionates as a high molecular weight complex as compared with R-CMLA alone (Fig.4 A). In the presence of 2 μm EF-Tu this amount is 21%. The interaction between EF-Tu and R-CMLA is not significantly different from that observed between R-CMLA and DnaK; at similar concentrations, DnaK bound 30–50% of R-CMLA (data not shown and Ref. 27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus EF-Tu seems to interact strongly with R-CMLA in a manner similar to that of DnaK. Unfolded BPTI is known to interact with chaperones, including DnaK (27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,30Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M. Johnson C. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 22: 14491-14496Google Scholar). Complex formation between 0.5 μm unfolded BPTI (6000 Da) and 4 μm EF-Tu (44,000 Da) was studied by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column; a significant percentage (18%) of unfolded BPTI fractionates as higher molecular mass material than unfolded BPTI alone (Fig. 4 B). In similar conditions, 4 μm DnaK retained 34% unfolded BPTI (not shown). In contrast, when 0.5 μm native BPTI and 4 μmEF-Tu were loaded on the gel permeation column, native BPTI did not elute as a high molecular mass complex (not shown). When similar experiments were carried out with bovine serum albumin (30 μm) or ovalbumin (30 μm), unfolded BPTI did not elute as a high molecular mass complex (not shown). Thus, EF-Tu, like molecular chaperones, interacts preferentially with unfolded proteins. During the protein elongation cycle, EF-Tu behaves like a GTPase that promotes the binding or aminoacyl-tRNA to codon-programmed ribosomes. The active GTP-bound form of EF-Tu binds aminoacyl-tRNA. When the ternary aminoacyl-tRNA·EF-Tu·GTP complex interacts with ribosomes in the presence of mRNA, the aminoacyl-tRNA is transferred to the ribosomes, and GTP is hydrolyzed, with the formation of the inactive GDP-bound form of EF-Tu. The latter dissociates from the ribosome and is recycled to EF-Tu·GTP by the nucleotide exchange factor EF-Ts (1Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Pestka S. Weissbach H. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 323-373Crossref Google Scholar, 2Brot N. Pestka S. Weissbach H. Molecular Mechanisms of Protein Biosynthesis. Academic Press, New York1977: 375-411Google Scholar, 3Kurland C.G. Hughes D. Ehrenberg H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 979-1004Google Scholar). We measured the ability of EF-Tu·GDP and EF-Tu·GTP to stimulate the renaturation of citrate synthase and α-glucosidase. As shown in Fig. 5, EF-Tu·GDP stimulated renaturation of citrate synthase and α-glucosidase 3-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively, whereas EF-Tu·GTP had almost no effect on this process. Thus the EF-Tu·GDP form, which is inactive for aminoacyl-tRNA binding, behaves like the active form in unfolded protein renaturation. We also tested the effects of unfolded proteins on the EF-Tu GTPase activity. The EF-Tu GTPase (which is normally stimulated by ribosomes plus aminoacyl-tRNA) can be stimulated by either of these components alone (5-fold and 2-fold, respectively) when assayed in the presence of the antibiotic kirromycin (24Wolf H. Chinali G. Parmeggiani A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Parlato G. Guesnet J. Crechet J.B. Parmeggiani A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unfolded R-CMLA did not trigger any stimulation of the kirromycin-dependent GTPase activity of EF-Tu (data not shown). This result is consistent with a preferential interaction of unfolded proteins with EF-Tu·GDP (and with a probable absence of effect of unfolded proteins on GDP dissociation from EF-Tu). We present biochemical evidence suggesting that EF-Tu has a chaperone-like function in protein folding, protection against thermal denaturation, and interaction with unfolded proteins. EF-Tu increases approximately 3-fold the yield of active citrate synthase and α-glucosidase renaturation, as do molecular chaperones. The stimulation factors of protein renaturation (more than 3-fold) and EF-Tu concentrations required for half-maximal protein renaturation (O.4–1 μm) are not significantly different from those obtained with DnaK, Hsp90, or small Hsps (this study, and Refs. 18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and25Wiech H. Buchner J. Zimmermann R. Jakob U.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Notably, the EF-Tu concentrations used in this study (in the micromolar range) are at least 50-fold lower than its estimated concentration in the bacterial cytoplasm (around 100 μm(28Weijland A. Harmark K. Cool R.H. Anborgh P.H. Parmeggiani A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). At micromolar concentrations, EF-Tu protects citrate synthase from thermal denaturation. These concentrations are similar to those of DnaK (24Wolf H. Chinali G. Parmeggiani A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and of small Hsp (expressed as monomers) required for a similar protection (18Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are 20-fold lower than the cytoplasmic concentration of EF-Tu. Furthermore, other proteins tested (bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and lysozyme) do not protect citrate synthase efficiently (27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). EF-Tu forms stable complexes with unfolded proteins. The EF-Tu·R-CMLA and DnaK·R-CMLA complexes (27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) display a similar stability. Like DnaK (27Richarme G. Caldas T. J. Biol.

A. 1991; 22: 14491-14496Google Scholar), EF-Tu interacts with unfolded BPTI but not with native BPTI and thus appears to discriminate between unfolded and native proteins. Our results show that EF-Tu can bind polypeptides. The elongation factor possesses an amino acid binding site that binds the aminoacyl moiety of aminoacyl-tRNAs (1Miller D.L. Weissbach H. Pestka S.

Although not proven by our results, a hydrophobic interaction between EF-Tu and unfolded proteins is likely (since unfolded proteins expose hydrophobic surfaces), and the site discussed above could be partly implicated in such an interaction. The strong interaction shown in this study between EF-Tu and unfolded proteins suggests that EF-Tu might interact with unfolded proteinsin vivo during protein folding or heat shock. During heat shock, the large quantity of EF-Tu molecules present in the cytoplasm and near the cytoplasmic membrane (6Jacobson G.R. Rosenbuch J.P. Nature. 1976; 261: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) might constitute a reservoir of chaperone-like molecules that serve as chaperone-buffer in preventing the aggregation of non-native proteins until permissive renaturation conditions are restored. EF-Tu takes its name from its relativethermo unstability. However, its stability in the presence of nucleotide cofactors extends up to 50 °C (19Arai K. Kawarita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 76: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a temperature higher than current heat shock temperatures of 40–45 °C (EF-Tu is bound to GTP or GDP in vivo). Although our results do not indicate whether EF-Tu interacts with proteins during translation and although EF-Tu has not been identified as one of the nascent chain binding proteins of E. coli (these proteins include DnaJ (35Hendrick J.P.

A. 1996; 93: 4437-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar)), several results suggest that EF-Tu might interact indeed with nascent chains. (i) Two EF-Tu molecules might be involved per translation cycle, both molecules interacting with a single aminoacyl-tRNA (39Ehrenberg M. Rojas A.M. Weiser J. Kurland C.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Weijland A. Parmeggiani A. Science. 1993; 259: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or one of them interacting with the aminoacyl-tRNA at the ribosomal A-site, the other interacting with the peptidyl-tRNA at the P-site (41Sprinzl M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); in both cases, there might exist some interaction between one EF-Tu molecule and the nascent peptidyl chain. (ii) The efficiency of EF-Tu-dependent read-through of stop codons depends on the last two amino acids of the nascent peptide at the ribosomal P-site, suggesting that there is an interaction between EF-Tu and the C-terminal amino acids in the nascent chain (42Mottagui-Tabar S. Isaksson L.A. Biochimie. 1996; 78: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). EF-Tu·GDP appears more active in binding unfolded proteins than EF-Tu·GTP. There are important conformational differences between both forms, which can explain the preferential affinity of one of them for unfolded proteins (41Sprinzl M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 245-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Since our manuscript was submitted, EF-Tu has been shown to catalyze rhodanese renaturation (43Kudlicki W. Coffman A. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32206-32210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In contrast with our results, EF-Tu·GDP is less active than EF·Tu·GTP in catalyzing rhodanese renaturation. This discrepancy could be explained by a quasi irreversible binding of EF-Tu·GDP to rhodanese, which would prevent its renaturation (such a result has been observed for the interaction between chaperones and substrate proteins (12Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 44Vitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, the EF-Tu-dependent renaturation of rhodanese is stimulated by EF-Ts and GTP, suggesting that, in the presence of these cofactors, EF-Tu can perform several rounds of protein renaturation. Finally, several functions of translational elongation factors are reminiscent of molecular chaperones. The microtubule-severing activity of EF-1α (8Yang F. Demma M. Warren V. Dharmawardhane S. Condeelis J. Nature. 1990; 347: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 9Shiina N. Gotoh Y. Kubomura N. Iwamatsu A. Nishida E.

These arrays were shown by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform optical diffraction, and computer simulations to be well ordered both along and perpendicular to the axis of the cylindrical pores. In their denuded state produced by gentle thermolysis, the cluster carbonylates yield nanoparticles of ruthenium that are less well ordered than their assimilated precursors but show good activity as hydrogenation catalysts for hexene and cyclooctene. In both their as-prepared and denuded states, these encapsulated clusters are likely to exhibit interesting electronic and other properties."

In this report, we have used substitution mutagenesis to identify a unique ligand recognition sequence in TNfn3. We introduced mutations substituting alanine for each of the acidic residues in or adjacent to each of the exposed loops predicted from the solved crystal structure.

Integrins are cell surface heterodimers that play roles in essential biological processes including development and tissue remodeling (1Hynes R.O.

Ligand binding specificity depends in large part on the specific α and β subunit present in each heterodimer. To date, extracellular matrix proteins, cell surface immunoglobulin superfamily molecules, and cadherins have been identified as ligands for integrins. In most cases where the crystal structure of integrin ligands have been solved, the ligand binding site includes at least one acidic residue, generally displayed in an exposed peptide loop (5Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 6Jones E. Harlos K. Bottomley M. Robinson R. Driscoll P. Edwards R. Clements J.

Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The first short peptide sequence identified as an integrin recognition sequence was the tripeptide, Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) (8Ruoslahti E. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar), initially identified as a cell-recognition sequence in the large extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin (9Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E.

Subsequently, this RGD sequence was found to be present in several integrin ligands and to serve as a recognition sequence for several different integrins (11Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar). As the sequences of multiple integrin α subunits were solved, it became clear that these sequences could be divided into 3 subfamilies based on sequence homology (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). One family includes α subunits with a characteristic disulfide-linked cleavage site. A subset of these form heterodimers that recognize RGD-containing ligands. Another includes α subunits that contain an inserted domain close to the N terminus but no cleavage site. These integrins generally do not recognize RGD-containing ligands. Finally, a third family, including only two α subunits, α9 and α4, contains neither an inserted domain nor a disulfide-linked cleavage site (12Palmer E.L. Ruegg C. Ferrando R. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have previously identified the third fibronectin type III repeat in the extracellular matrix protein tenascin (TNfn3) 1The abbreviation used is: TNfn3, third fibronectin type III repeat. as a ligand for the only known α9-containing integrin, α9β1 (13Yokosaki Y.

A. 1993; 90: 10154-10158Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TNfn3 has been solved and consists of a series of seven β strands separated by six exposed loops (5Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). α8β1, αvβ3, and αvβ6all bind to the RGD tripeptide contained within the F-G loop. However, unlike each of these integrins, α9β1 could mediate adhesion to a fragment in which this site was mutated to RAA, and adhesion was unaffected by RGD peptides, suggesting that the ligand binding site was distinct from this RGD site (13Yokosaki Y.

In the present study, we have used substitution mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to identify this site in an adjacent exposed loop on the same face of tenascin-C as the RGD loop.

Concentrations of recombinant proteins were determined by the Bradford assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on a peptide synthesizer (Model 432A, Perkin-Elmer) at Center Laboratory for Research and Education, Osaka University, followed by purification with C18-reversed phase column chromatography. As described previously (22Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wells of non-tissue culture-treated polystyrene 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) were coated by incubation with 100 μl of recombinant wild type or mutant tenascin fragment in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 1 h. For blocking experiments, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of soluble peptide or Y9A2 on ice for 15 min before plating on tenascin fragments. Wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 50,000 cells were added to each well in 200 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Plates were centrifuged at 10 × g for 1 min, then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed by centrifugation top side down at 48 × g for 5 min. The attached cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and excess dye was washed off with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were solubilized in 50 μl of 2% Triton X-100 and quantified by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm in a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Both strands of the expression plasmid were replicated by polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase with two complementary primers designed to introduce the desired mutation. The amplification product was treated with DpnI endonuclease, specific for methylated DNA, to digest the parental DNA template. Then XL-1 blue competent cells were transformed with the polymerase chain reaction-generated nicked plasmid. Plasmids from several isolated colonies were prepared by Wizard mini-prep (Promega, Madison, WI), and inserts were sequenced by ALFred autosequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) with fluorescent-tagged primers flanking the polylinker of the pGEX vector. The verified mutated inserts were subcloned into pGEX vector that had not been amplified by polymerase chain reaction. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing either wild type or variant TNfn3 were prepared by bacterial expression with the pGEX plasmids as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, competent XL-1 blue cells were transformed by heat shock and grown on ampicillin-containing plates. Individual colonies were picked and propagated in 2 ml of 2× YT medium (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight. 100 ml of 2× YT medium was inoculated with 1 ml of the bacteria and incubated until A 600 reached 0.5–2 at 30 °C, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Cultures were grown for several more hours, cells were collected and sonicated, and fusion proteins were affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Purity of the product was confirmed by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Binding of authentic or scrambled peptides to the ligand binding site of α9β1 was assessed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody 15/7, which recognizes a ligand binding-dependent epitope on the integrin β1subunit. Mock- or α9-transfected SW480 cells were incubated with the peptides VTDTTAL, AEIDGIEL, or with the scrambled peptide GDLAIEEI in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with antibody 15/7 at 15 μg/ml for 20 min at 4 °C at final peptide concentration of 100, 300, or 1,000 μm followed by incubation with secondary phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Induction of the epitope recognized by 15/7 was then quantified on 5,000 cells with a Becton Dickinson FACSort. According to the published crystal structure of TNfn3 (5Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), there are six extended loops separating seven β strands (Fig.1). The previously characterized RGD sequence is in the F-G loop. Since most integrin binding sites include at least one acidic residue in an extended loop structure, we made a series of alanine substitution mutations encompassing each acidic residue present in or near a predicted loop, including the potential loop at the N terminus of this repeat (Asp-775, Fig.2). Fig. 2 shows the locations of each of the substitution mutations described in this study. We could identify acidic residues in or adjacent to five loops (all except the loop between the E and F strands). For efficiency, we sometimes made simultaneous mutations in more than one acidic residue.Figure 2Alignment of tenascin amino acid sequences of human, chicken, pig, and mouse tenascin-C. The large arrow (➤) indicates initially mutated series of acidic residues in each loop. Aspartic acid 816, 821, 825 were simultaneously mutated.

Monis H. Chen J. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24144-24150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of each mutation on α9β1-mediated adhesion, we performed cell adhesion assays on plates coated with wild type TNfn3 or with TNfn3 expressing mutations in one or more loop. To determine the specificity of any decreases in adhesion of α9-transfected cells, we also performed adhesion assays on the same fragments with β3-transfected SW480 cells. As previously reported, both α9- and β3-transfected cells adhered to wild type TNfn3, but only α9-transfected cells adhered to TNfn3 in which the RGD sequence in the F-G loop was mutated to RAA (Fig.3). Attachment of α9-transfected cells to wild type TNfn3 was completely blocked by anti-α9 monoclonal antibody Y9A2. Mutations in acidic residues in the N terminus (D775A), the C-C′ loop (D812A), or the C-C′ and C′-E loops (D816A/D821A/D825A) had no effect on adhesion of either transfectant. However a mutation in the B-C loop (E802A) specifically and markedly reduced attachment of α9-transfected SW480 cells (Fig. 3, panel A). The only other mutation that decreased adhesion of α9-transfected cells was a mutation in the A-B loop (D787A), which reduced adhesion by approximately 40%. Mock-transfected SW480 cells did not adhere to any of the TNfn3 fragments used in this study (data not shown). To examine the role of specific acidic residues in or adjacent to either the B-C or A-B loops, we generated fragments expressing each of 3 additional mutations. Mutations of the aspartic acid residue just proximal to the A-B loop (D784A) or of the most proximal glutamic acid residue in the B-C loop (E800A) had no effect on adhesion. However, mutation of the next glutamic acid residue in the adjacent C β strand (E805A) reduced adhesion of α9-transfected cells to the same degree as E802A, either at concentrations of 0.3 μg or at 3 μg/ml, without effect on adhesion of β3-transfectants (Fig. 4). In an attempt to further determine whether sites in the A-B loop or the B-C loop were critical for α9β1-mediated adhesion to TNfn3, we synthesized linear peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of each of these loops of human TNfn3 and evaluated the ability of these peptides to inhibit adhesion of either α9-transfected or β3-transfected SW480 cells to 3 μg/ml wild type TNfn3 (Fig.5). We designed these peptides based on the human sequence to increase the likelihood that any effective peptide could serve as a starting point for drug design. The peptide Ala-Glu-Ile-Asp-Gly-Ile-Glu-Leu (AEIDGIEL) based on the B-C loop caused concentration dependent inhibition of adhesion of α9transfectants with no effect on adhesion of the β3-transfected control cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, the peptide Val-Thr-Asp-Thr-Thr-Ala-Leu (VTDTTAL) corresponding to the A-B loop was without effect. In addition, the scrambled peptide GDLAIEEI, based on AEIDGIEL, had no effect on cell adhesion. These data further suggest that the B-C loop is critical to ligand binding. As further confirmation of the role of the B-C loop sequence in directly interacting with the α9β1 integrin, we examined the effects of each peptide on expression of the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 15/7, an antibody that has previously been shown to be made accessible following direct interaction of β1-integrins with ligand (21Yednock T.A. Cannon C. Vandevert C. Goldbach E.G. Shaw G. Ellis D.K. Liaw C. Fritz L.C. Tanner L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28740-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To determine whether any peptide-induced expression of the 15/7 epitope was specifically due to interaction of peptides with α9β1, and not to interaction with other β1-integrins expressed on SW480 cells, we compared the effects of each peptide on α9-transfected or mock-transfected cells. The AEIDGIEL peptide, but not the VTDTTAL or scrambled peptides, significantly induced the epitope recognized by antibody 15/7 on α9-transfected cells (Fig.6). None of the peptides examined affected 15/7 expression of mock-transfected cells, demonstrating that induction of expression was due to specific interaction of the AEIDGIEL peptide with α9β1. Previous work identified tenascin-C as a ligand for the integrin α9β1 and localized the binding site to TNfn3 (13Yokosaki Y. Palmer E.L. Prieto A.L. Crossin K.L. Bourdon M.A. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used substitution mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to map the ligand binding site within this repeat in more detail. The dramatic reduction of adhesion of α9-transfected, but not β3-transfected cells to mutant fragments in which either the second or third acidic residue in the B-C loop region was replaced with alanine identify this region as critical for ligand binding. The effect of a peptide based on this region, AEIDGIEL, but not of a corresponding scrambled peptide in inhibiting adhesion of α9-transfected cells to wild type TNfn3, and specific induction of a ligand binding-dependent epitope on the β1 subunit by the same peptide, provide further evidence that this region includes the ligand binding site. One other mutation, D787A, involving an acidic residue in the A-B loop also decreased adhesion of α9-transfected SW480 cells. On the basis of this result, we cannot exclude a role for this region in binding to α9β1. However, several pieces of evidence suggest that the A-B loop is unlikely to be the principal site of interaction with this integrin. First the degree of inhibition caused by this mutation was much less than that caused by mutations in the B-C loop. This partial inhibition was not due to a contribution by other adjacent acidic residues to α9β1adhesion, since mutation of the only adjacent acidic residue had no effect on adhesion. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to this region, VTDTTAL, had no effect on adhesion and did not induce the ligand-dependent epitope on the β1 subunit. It is thus likely that the D787A mutation inhibited adhesion by altering the conformation of a critical region of the B-C loop on the opposite face of TNfn3. Several ligand binding sites for integrins have now been mapped within fibronectin type III repeats and immunoglobulin domains (23Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M.

In every case these sequences have included a critical acidic residue. Many of these sites include the classic integrin recognition motif, RGD, but binding to RGD sites is largely restricted to integrins that contain the closely related α subunits (α5, α8, αIIb, and αv) containing a disulfide-linked cleavage site. Based on its amino acid sequence, α9 is most similar to α4 (28Takada Y. Elices M.J. Crouse C. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1361-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recognition sites for the integrin α4β1 in the ligands fibronectin and VCAM-1 have been extensively investigated. In fibronectin, 3 sites have been identified: LDV (23Komoriya A. Green L.J. Mervic M.

All of these recognition sequences contain a homologous tripeptide composed of a leucine or isoleucine followed by an acidic residue, followed by a neutral amino acid with a small side chain. The sequence we identified in this study, AEIDGIEL, contains a homologous tripeptide, IDG. Recognition of the importance of this motif could facilitate the identification of other integrin ligands. The synthetic peptide used in this study, AEIDGIEL, specifically inhibited α9β1-mediated cell adhesion. The potency of this peptide was quite low, however, requiring a concentration of 1000 μm to achieve approximately 50% inhibition. This particular peptide is thus not likely to itself be useful as a reagent to examine the functional significance of α9β1 in vivo. Nonetheless, since the crystal structure of TNfn3 has been solved, this peptide and the known structure of the B-C loop could serve as starting points for the development of drugs (8Ruoslahti E. Ann.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 1The abbreviations used are: GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; GnRH-R, GnRH receptor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; TRH-R, thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor; WT, wild type; BSA, bovine serum albumin. is a decapeptide released by the hypothalamus which acts on specific receptors in the anterior pituitary. GnRH and its receptor (GnRH-R) are key mediators of the regulation of the reproductive axis controlling the synthesis and release of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. The GnRH-R is a member of the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (1Eidne K.A. Sellar R.E. Couper G. Anderson L. Taylor P.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: R5-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and is preferentially coupled to phosphoinositidase C via the Gq/G11family of G-proteins. Following stimulation by GnRH, the production of inositol phosphates (IPs) and diacylglycerol is induced resulting in the elevation of cytosolic calcium and the activation of protein kinase C (2Morgan R.O. Chang J.P. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1166-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorf W.P. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol.

A number of GPCRs exhibit homologous desensitization upon prolonged stimulation with agonist. This involves uncoupling of G-proteins, rapid down-regulation of the receptor's effector systems such as total inositol phosphate (IP) production followed by receptor internalization, and presumably subsequent proteolytic degradation. In particular this has been demonstrated for the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (5Tobin A.B. Willars G.B. Burford N.T. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1723-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRH-R) (6Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol.

The phosphorylation of specific amino acids in the cytoplasmic part of the C-terminal tail of several GPCRs has been implicated in desensitization events (3Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorf W.P. Caron M.G.

This phosphorylation event is rapid, occurring within the first few minutes of agonist addition. Of all the GPCRs cloned to date, the mammalian GnRH-R is the only receptor in which the functionally important intracellular cytoplasmic C-terminal tail is completely absent, as it is truncated at the cell membrane immediately after the seventh transmembrane domain (1Eidne K.A. Sellar R.E. Couper G. Anderson L. Taylor P.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 90: R5-R9Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Studies by our group and by others (7Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K.

It is possible that during evolution the mammalian GnRH-R has lost its intracellular cytoplasmic C-terminal tail as a result of a mutation creating a stop codon, particularly since GnRH receptors in non-mammalian species such as African catfish (14Tensen C. Okuzawa K. Blomenrohr M. Rebers F. Leurs R. Bogerd J. Schulz R. Goos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), goldfish, frog, and chicken (15Troskie, B.

Here we have examined the rapid desensitization events of a non-mammalian (catfish) GnRH receptor. We have also created a GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera where the cytoplasmic tail of the rat TRH-R has been engineered into the C-terminal region of the rat GnRH-R. Furthermore, to investigate the possibility that a functional “ghost tail” (the amino acids translated from the natural stop codon to the next stop codon in the untranslated region) exists in mammalian species, we have created three different stop codon mutations (one for each reading frame) within the rat GnRH-R cDNA. The aim of this study has been to investigate whether the missing cytoplasmic C-terminal tail could be implicated in the inability of the rat's GnRH-R to show rapid desensitization of IP production and its exceptionally slow internalization kinetics. Inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, UK. Transfectam was obtained from Promega, Southampton, UK. All other tissue culture reagents and media were supplied by Sigma Cell Culture, Dorset, UK. Dowex resin was obtained from Bio-Rad. [3H]Myoinositol was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK. TRH-(3-Me-His2)-[3H] were from NEN Life Science Products, Hertfordshire; TRH-(3-Me-His2) and chicken II GnRH were from Peninsula Laboratories, Merseyside, UK. All other compounds and reagents were obtained from Sigma, Dorset, UK. HEK 293 and COS-7 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Center for Applied Microbiology and Research, Salisbury, UK. The full-length rat GnRH-R cDNA in the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was subjected to oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis using standard methods to generate three stop codon mutations, one for each reading frame. The natural stop codon (TAA) was changed to GCAA for the +1 base mutant and GCA for the in-frame mutant. The −1 base mutant was created by changing the stop codon to GCA and deleting the naturally occurring T following the stop codon. In all three cases the stop codon was changed to a codon coding for alanine (Fig. 1 A). To create the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera, a ClaI restriction enzyme site was introduced in the stop codon of the rat GnRH-R cDNA, andClaI sites were introduced at the N- and C-terminal ends of the rat TRH-R cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. The untranslated base sequence from nucleotides 981 to 990 in the rat GnRH-R was changed from TAA TTG GGA to CAA ATC GAT introducing the ClaI site and changing the stop codon to glutamine. The base sequence from nucleotides 997 to 1003 at the N terminus of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the TRH-R was changed from AAG CTC to ATC GAT, and the untranslated base sequence from nucleotides 1238 to 1243 in the TRH-R was changed from ACT TCC to ATC GAT introducing two ClaI sites. The mutated C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the TRH-R was then amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction product was first cloned into the TA vector PCR 2.1 (Invitrogen), excised with ClaI enzyme, and then inserted into the newly created ClaI site of the GnRH-R cDNA in the vector pcDNA3. The cDNA clones were sequenced several times using an Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK) 373A automated sequencer. Sequence analysis was performed by means of the program GeneJockey II (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Monolayer cultures of COS-7 cells (3 × 106 cells in 75-cm2 flasks) were transiently transfected with WT rat GnRH-R, rat TRH-R, rat GnRH receptor constructs, or the catfish GnRH-R in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 using a standard DEAE-dextran method. Cells were then grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air before use. HEK 293 cells were stably transfected with the appropriate DNA using Transfectam. Receptor expressing clones were selected with Geneticin (1 mg/ml) and identified with a functional receptor binding assay. The cell lines expanded from these clones were then used for further study. Iodinated radiolabeled GnRH analogue was prepared using the glucose oxidase/lactoperoxidase method and purified by chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column in 0.01m acetic acid, 0.1% BSA. The specific activity of the [125I-des-Gly10,d-Trp6]GnRH was 56 μCi/μg and was calculated from self-displacement assays using either rat pituitary homogenates or HEK 293 cells stably expressing the wild-type GnRH-R. The specific activity of the125I-chicken II tracer was 90 μCi/μg and was calculated as described previously (16Bramley T.A. McPhie C.A. Menzies G.S. Placenta. 1992; 13: 555-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates. The cells were washed once with assay medium (HEPES modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) before being incubated with 125I-labeled GnRH agonist, 125I-labeled chicken II GnRH or [3H]TRH-(3-Me-His2) in 0.5-ml assay medium for time intervals ranging from 5 min to 2 h at 37 °C. At appropriate times, cells were transferred onto ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Subsequently, the extracellular receptor-associated ligand was removed by washing once with 1 ml of acid solution (50 mm acetic acid and 150 mmNaCl, pH 2.8) for 12 min. The acid wash was collected to determine the surface-bound radioactivity, and the internalized radioactivity was determined after solubilizing the cells in 0.2 m NaOH and 1% SDS (NaOH/SDS) solution. Nonspecific binding for each time point was determined under the same conditions in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled agonist. For control experiments, untransfected HEK 293 cells were assayed under identical conditions. After subtraction of nonspecific binding, the internalized radioactivity was expressed as a percentage of the total binding at that time interval. All time points were performed in triplicate in at least three separate experiments. Ligand binding assays were carried out on cell membranes from receptor expressing cells as described previously (17Cook J.V. Faccenda E. Anderson L. Cooper G.C. Eidne K.A. Taylor P.L. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 139: R1-R4Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified membranes were incubated for 120 min in assay buffer (40 mm Tris·HCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) at 4 °C with125I-labeled GnRH agonist ([des-Gly10,d-Trp6]GnRH),125I-labeled chicken II GnRH or [3H]TRH-(3-Me-His2) with or without 10−6m unlabeled agonist present. For dose-displacement assays the unlabeled agonist concentration varied from 10−10 to 10−6m. The membranes were then filtered, and the radioactivity was counted. All assays were performed in triplicate. Binding parameters were determined from displacement curves. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with a BSA standard. Total IPs were extracted and separated as described previously (12McArdle C.A. Forrest-Owen W. Willars G. Davidson J. Poch A. Kratzmeier M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4864-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Anderson L. Milligan G. Eidne K.A. J. Endocrinol. 1993; 136: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well plates containing 1 × 105 cells per well were incubated with inositol free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and [3H]myoinositol (2 μCi/well) for 48 h. Medium was then removed, and cells were washed with buffer containing 10 mm LiCl followed by addition of the appropriate ligand at a range of time points. The reaction was stopped by adding cold perchloric acid or boiling water. Neutralized supernatants from extracted cells were then transferred to tubes containing AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin. Total IPs were then eluted, and the radioactivity was counted. Fig. 1 A shows sequence alignments of the C-terminal end of known sequences of cloned WT GnRH receptors, whereas Fig. 1 B shows the chimeric (GnRH-R/TRH-R) and stop codon (+1 base, −1 base and in frame) receptor constructs. Putative phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II are highlighted. The +1 base mutant and the −1 base mutant both exhibited reduced (30–40%) 125I-GnRH agonist binding and GnRH-stimulated IP production (50–60%) when compared with the WT GnRH-R (Fig. 2). The in-frame stop codon mutant with the longest extension (52 amino acids) demonstrated no GnRH agonist binding nor IP production. The GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera was able to bind GnRH agonist and stimulate IP production even though its tail extension was the longest (79 amino acids) of all these constructs. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing the rat WT GnRH-R, we observed that the GnRH-stimulated IP production did not desensitize even after stimulation with GnRH for up to 45 min (the rate of IP production did not slow down) (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the IP production of the WT rat TRH-R did undergo desensitization after the first 5 min of TRH stimulation (Fig.3 B) following which a decrease in IP production was observed. The GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera was also able to desensitize after 10 min stimulation with GnRH (Fig. 3 C). Desensitization of IP production seen for the chimera resembled that observed for the TRH-R, demonstrating the importance of the functional C-terminal tail. Unlike the mammalian GnRH-R, the catfish GnRH-R desensitized rapidly (within the first 5 min) following stimulation with GnRH (in this case, chicken II GnRH, the preferred endogenous ligand for the catfish GnRH-R (14Tensen C. Okuzawa K. Blomenrohr M. Rebers F. Leurs R. Bogerd J. Schulz R. Goos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 3 D). From the data shown in Fig. 3 the initial rate of IP production (the first 10 min of stimulation) and the rate after 10 min was calculated as described by Perlman and Gershengorn (8Perlman J.H.

As seen in Table I the rat WT GnRH-R did not show significant desensitization in contrast to the rat WT TRH-R, the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera, and the catfish GnRH-R.

We again observed that the TRH-R, catfish GnRH-R, and the chimera desensitized, whereas the rat GnRH-R did not (Fig.4). We did, however, observe a difference between the two sets of experiments. In the 293 cells expressing the TRH-R, catfish GnRH-R, and the chimera, the IP response desensitized after approximately 100 s which is considerably faster than the COS-7 cells that desensitized after 5–10 min. From the data shown in Fig. 4 the initial rate of IP production (the first 120 s of stimulation) and the rate after 120 s was calculated as described by Perlman and Gershengorn (8Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). As seen in TableII the rat WT GnRH-R did not show significant desensitization in contrast to the rat WT TRH-R, the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera, and the catfish GnRH-R when stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K d ) and receptor numbers (B max) were 0.2 nm and 3.1 pmol/mg protein for the rat GnRH-R expressing HEK 293 cells,K d = 0.7 nm andB max = 3.7 pmol/mg protein for the catfish expressing HEK 293 cells, and K d = 1.6 nm and B max = 9.5 pmol/mg protein for the GnRH-R/TRH-R expressing HEK 293 cells. We have previously published K d = 4 nm andB max = 13.5 pmol/mg protein values for the TRH-R expressing HEK 293 cells (13Anderson L. Alexander C.L. Faccenda E. Eidne K.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In GH3 cells which endogenously express TRH-Rs, we observed that the desensitization of IP production occurred after 10 min stimulation (data not shown), and we have previously shown that pituitary gonadotrope alpha T3-1 cells endogenously expressing GnRH-Rs do not undergo rapid desensitization of IP production (19Anderson L. McGregor A. Cook J.V.F. Chilvers E. Eidne K.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5228-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Untransfected cells and cells transfected with receptors not matching the stimulating agonist did not respond to stimulation (data not shown).Table IIRates of agonist-stimulated total IP production in HEK 293 cellsReceptor expressed in HEK 293 cellsInitial rate 0–120 sRate after 120 sDesensitization%/s%Rat GnRH-R0.036 ± 0.0010.037 ± 0.0010 ± 3Rat TRH-R0.051 ± 0.002−0.001 ± 0.002100 ± 6GnRH-R/TRHR chimera0.013 ± 0.00030.0015 ± 0.000288 ± 2Catfish GnRH-R0.013 ± 0.0010.0062 ± 0.000352 ± 3 Open table in a new tab To investigate the possible role of the added cytoplasmic tail on the ability of the rat GnRH-R to internalize, we performed a series of internalization experiments using the four stably transfected HEK 293 cell lines described above. Approximately 70% of the rat TRH-Rs were internalized after 15 min stimulation with TRH, whereas approximately 10% of the rat GnRH-Rs were internalized after 15 min stimulation with GnRH (Fig. 5). The rat GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera and the catfish GnRH-R internalized considerably faster than the rat GnRH-R but slower than the TRH-R. More than 20% of the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera receptors were internalized after 15 min stimulation with GnRH, and approximately 50% of the catfish GnRH-Rs were internalized after 15 min stimulation with chicken II GnRH (Fig.5). By using a two-component model described by Koenig and Edwardson (20Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), we calculated the rate constant for endocytosis (k e) and the rate constant for recycling (k r) (Table III). The rate of endocytosis for the TRH-R was faster than for the other receptors, and the rate of recycling was similar to that of the chimera and the catfish GnRH-R but twice that of the rat GnRH-R. The rate constants for the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera were approximately double the rate constants for the rat GnRH-R. Internalization experiments were also performed with GH3 and alpha T3-1 cells, and internalization rates were comparable to those observed for the HEK 293 cells expressing TRH or GnRH receptors (data not shown).Table IIIRate constants of receptor endocytosis and recycling in HEK 293 cellsReceptor stably expressed in HEK 293 cellsEndocytosis rate constantk eRecycling rate constant k rmin−1Rat GnRH-R0.012 ± 0.0010.033 ± 0.003Rat TRH-R0.19 ± 0.0010.06 ± 0.001GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera0.03 ± 0.0020.063 ± 0.001Catfish GnRH-R0.099 ± 0.0060.068 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab The aim of this study was to investigate the desensitization and internalization events of the WT rat GnRH-R and compare these findings with results obtained from GnRH-Rs with naturally occurring or artificially added C-terminal tails. In this paper we describe functional characteristics of the WT rat TRH-R, WT catfish GnRH-R, WT rat GnRH-R, three rat GnRH-R stop codon mutants, and the rat GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera where the cytoplasmic tail of the TRH-R has been engineered into the stop codon of the rat GnRH-R. We found no sequence homology between the C-terminal region of the three stop codon mutants and the catfish GnRH-R. This result is perhaps not surprising as there has been no evolutionary pressure on the ghost tails (the amino acids translated in each reading frame beyond the natural stop codon to the next stop codon in the 3′-untranslated region) for millions of years. We also demonstrated that cells transfected with the stop codon mutants bound GnRH agonist less well than cells transfected with WT GnRH-R, possibly due to reduced expression. The binding was observed to decrease with increasing length of the tail, and the stop codon mutant with the longest tail (52 amino acids) showed no binding at all, indicating that the cells might not be able to process a GnRH-R with a long unnatural C-terminal tail. In support of this, COS-7 cells transfected with the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera bound GnRH agonist about 40% as well as cells transfected with WT GnRH-R, even though the added TRH-R C-terminal tail (79 amino acids) is longer than any of the ghost tails. To investigate whether the addition of a known C-terminal tail belonging to another GPCR would affect the function of the rat GnRH-R, we created a GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera where the cytoplasmic tail of the rat TRH-R was engineered into the C terminus of the rat GnRH-R. It could be argued that the creation of a rat GnRH-R/catfish GnRH-R chimera where the C-terminal tail of the catfish GnRH-R had been added to the C-terminal of the rat GnRH-R would be more relevant. However, we chose to use the C-terminal tail of the rat TRH-R as this receptor is also a pituitary GPCR and is from the same species as the GnRH-R. Moreover, the C-terminal tail of the TRH-R is of functional importance as has been shown in several studies where mutated TRH receptors with increasingly truncated C-terminal tails were studied (6Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2389-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Matus-Leibovitch N. Nussenveig D.R. Gershengorn M.C. Oron Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1041-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The TRH-R has also been shown by several groups to undergo desensitization at the level of IP production (7Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Millar R.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Similar data were not available for the catfish GnRH-R before this study. In addition the amino acid sequence homology between the mammalian and the catfish GnRH-R is only 38% (14Tensen C. Okuzawa K. Blomenrohr M. Rebers F. Leurs R. Bogerd J. Schulz R. Goos H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and also the catfish GnRH-R does not recognize mammalian GnRH as its primary agonist. We observed that GnRH stimulated total IP production in cells expressing WT rat GnRH-R did not desensitize even after prolonged stimulation with GnRH. This is in agreement with several other reports (7Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Millar R.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 12McArdle C.A. Forrest-Owen W.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5228-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) describing the lack of desensitization of GnRH induced IP production in various cell lines (HEK 293, GH3, and alpha T3-1 cells) expressing the receptor. The rapid desensitization observed for the TRH-R is also supported by the findings of other groups (7Davidson J.S. Wakefield I.K. Millar R.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Perlman J.H. Gershengorn M.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2679-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) who studied the rapid desensitization events of TRH-R-stimulated IP production in GH3 cells. The onset of desensitization in these cells varied considerably (from approximately 1 min to 20 min) in these studies, perhaps a result of different methods used. The GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera desensitized in a manner similar to that observed for WT TRH-R and catfish GnRH-R, indicating that the inability of the rat's GnRH-R to desensitize is probably caused by the receptor's lack of a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail. It has been established that upon agonist stimulation of GPCRs the receptors become phosphorylated on different intracellular amino acids, many of which are situated on the C-terminal tail. This phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinases such as protein kinase A, protein kinase C, β-adrenoreceptor kinase, or other members of the family of G-protein receptor kinases (3Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorf W.P. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5Tobin A.B. Willars G.B. Burford N.T. Nahorski S.R. Br. J.

Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the GnRH-R lacks a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail and thus important phosphorylation sites may explain its inability to undergo rapid desensitization. The time course of desensitization of total IP production was cell line-dependent as desensitization was faster in HEK 293 cells (100 s) than in COS-7 cells (5–10 min). The reason for this is not clear but could possibly be due to differences in the intracellular mechanisms of the two cell types. Phosphorylation of receptors has also been reported to be important for endocytosis, for example via phosphorylation by β-adrenoreceptor kinase followed by recruitment of the cytosolic protein β-arrestin (20Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 23Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) or by phosphorylation of amino acids on the C-terminal tail (11Wang Z. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 748-759PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will investigate possible phosphorylation and the functional importance of specific amino acids in the C-terminal tails of the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera and the catfish GnRH-R. Because truncation of the C-terminal tail of the TRH-R impairs endocytosis (6Nussenzveig D.R. Heinflink M. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2389-2392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is perhaps not surprising that the rat GnRH-R internalizes with a lower rate of endocytosis than the catfish GnRH-R and the TRH-R. The finding that the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera also internalizes faster than the WT GnRH-R suggests that a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail is necessary for rapid internalization. We used a two-component model to calculate endocytosis and recycling rate constants k e andk r, respectively. This model does not take into account synthesis of new receptors or receptor degradation. However, the model was found to be acceptable as receptor degradation is not believed to take place during the time course of an internalization experiment (21Kobilka B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that internalization experiments performed in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), a protein synthesis inhibitor, did not affect the results (data not shown). All the receptors gave similar k rvalues, with the exception of the rat GnRH-R which recycled at about half the rate of the others. The k e for the GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera was approximately 2-fold higher than the corresponding value for the WT GnRH-R but still lower than the values for the catfish GnRH-R and the TRH-R. Internalization rates of the GnRH-R/TRH-R are not the same as the internalization rates for the TRH-R, thus demonstrating that factors other than the C-terminal tail might also be involved in the rate of internalization. In support of this, recent evidence has suggested that sites within the third intracellular loop of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and in the second intracellular loop of the GnRH-R are involved in receptor internalization (24Arora K.K. Cheng Z. Catt K.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Goldman P.S. Schlador M.L. Shapiro R.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4215-4222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the slow internalization and lack of rapid desensitization of the mammalian GnRH-R are not understood. It is, however, possible that the receptor's slow internalization and lack of rapid desensitization is important for keeping a large number of active receptors at the gonadotrope cell surface, in particular during the GnRH surge that precedes the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge (26Moenter S.M. Brand R.C. Karsch F.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2978-2984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It can be speculated that in more primitive ancestral species the GnRH surge is not as profound as in mammals. In summary, we have found evidence that shows the missing cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the rat GnRH-R to be at least partly responsible for the inability of this receptor to desensitize at the level of total IP production. We also found that the introduction of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the rat TRH-R into the C terminus of the rat GnRH-R increased the internalization rates. We are grateful to Dr. T. A.

This formylation/deformylation cycle, which appears to be a characteristic feature of eubacteria, does not occur in the cytoplasm of eucaryotic cells. Therefore, PDF is an attractive target for the design of new antibiotics.PDF from E. coli, a monomeric protein of 168 residues, shares the fingerprint motifs HEXXH (6Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J.

PDF was reported to be a zinc enzyme (8Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that contains the motif HEXXH, known to be involved in zinc binding in metalloproteases (9Vallee B.L. Auld D.S.

Meanwhile, it has been shown that PDF utilizes Fe2+ as catalytic metal whereas the Zn2+ form is nearly inactive (11Groche, D.

F. V. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., in press. Crystals were washed in 100 mm MOPS/NH3, 1% (w/v) PEG-1000, 2 m (NH4)2SO4 at pH 7.4. Three isomorphous derivatives were obtained by soaking crystals in the above buffer with added heavy atom compounds. The mercury derivative crystals were harvested after soaking 12 h in 0.1 mm ethylmercury phosphate (EMP), the platinum derivative after soaking 24 h in 2 mmK2PtCl4, and the double derivative after soaking 24 h in 0.1 mm CH3HgCl and 2 mm K2PtCl4. PDF-Ni crystals without PEG have been described.2Diffraction data were collected at room temperature by the rotation method and recorded by an electronic area detector (x-rays: CuKα, focused by Franks double-mirror optics; generator: GX-18, Elliot/Enraf-Nonius, Delft, operated at 35 kV/50 mA; detector: X100, Siemens/Nicolet, Madison, WI; crystal to detector distance: 10 cm; rotation/image: 0.0417° or 0.0833°). Integrated intensities were extracted from the rotation images by the program XDS (15Kabsch W. J. Appl.

PDF activity was measured at 30 °C with formyl-Met (1–32 mm) at pH 7.2 (100 mm MOPS/NaOH, 2 mLi2SO4, 1 mm TCEP) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by 420 ng of PDF-Ni (5 μl) and stopped after 5 min by 4% HClO4 (50 μl). The amount of hydrolyzed substrate was determined according to the method of Fields (17Fields R. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzolsulfonic acid (ε420 = 22 mm−1cm−1). For inhibition studies, up to 10 mmPEG-1000, pretreated with TCEP (350 mm PEG/35 mm TCEP, pH 7.2) for 1 h, was included in the assay mixture. V max and apparent K M values were estimated from double-reciprocal plots (1/v versus 1/[S]), and the KI value was calculated from secondary replots of the slopes versusPEG-1000 concentrations.DISCUSSIONSince its discovery about 30 years ago PDF is known to rapidly lose its activity, which makes its purification difficult (2Adams J.M.

(1995) Characterization of the Iron Center and the Catalytic Mechanism of Peptide Deformylase from Escherichia coli.Doctoral dissertation, Universität Heidelberg.Google Scholar).The three structures now known appear to be generally similar although significant differences remain that could well be of importance for understanding the enzyme mechanism. The two zinc structures (8Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have been compared previously (13Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the following discussion focuses on the differences between the zinc and nickel structures determined by x-ray analysis. These differences include Pro-9, which is in a cis-conformation as well as two of the three 310 helices, Glu-11–Arg-14 and Phe-142–Tyr-145, which have been modeled as α-helices α1 and α4in the zinc structure (13Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Other structural differences are found in the region Glu-87–Leu-99, which includes the β-ribbon. In the active site region the fourth metal ligand corresponding to W1 seems to be displaced, and the important water molecule W2 appears to be absent from the zinc structure. Also, the side chain of Gln-50 is more involved in stabilizing W2 rather than W1, and the amide hydrogens of Leu-91 and Ala-47 are found at distances 5 and 4.6 Å from W1, respectively, which is too far for a hydrogen bond as reported previously (13Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In eubacteria as well as in mitochondria and chloroplasts the amino group of methionyl-tRNAfMet isN-formylated by a formyltransferase during initiation of protein synthesis (1Kozak M. Microbiol. Rev. 1983; 47: 1-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, all nascent polypeptides are synthesized with N-formylmethionine at the N terminus. During elongation of the polypeptide chain the formyl group is removed hydrolytically by the enzyme peptide deformylase (PDF, 1The abbreviations used are: PDF, peptide deformylase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; r.m.s., root mean square. 1The abbreviations used are: PDF, peptide deformylase; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; r.m.s., root mean square. EC 3.5.1.27) (2Adams J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Ball L.A. Kaesberg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 79: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For Escherichia coli, deletion of the formyltransferase gene leads to a strongly reduced cell growth rate (4Guillon J.-M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.-M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of the PDF gene proves lethal (5Mazel D. Pochet S. Marlière P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This formylation/deformylation cycle, which appears to be a characteristic feature of eubacteria, does not occur in the cytoplasm of eucaryotic cells. Therefore, PDF is an attractive target for the design of new antibiotics. PDF from E. coli, a monomeric protein of 168 residues, shares the fingerprint motifs HEXXH (6Meinnel T. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7737-7740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EGCLS, and GXGXAAXQ (7Meinnel T. Lazennec C. Villoing S. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) with PDF sequences of other eubacteria, which suggests a common architecture of the catalytic region in these proteins. PDF was reported to be a zinc enzyme (8Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that contains the motif HEXXH, known to be involved in zinc binding in metalloproteases (9Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 10Jongeneel C.V. Bouvier J. Bairoch A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, it has been shown that PDF utilizes Fe2+ as catalytic metal whereas the Zn2+ form is nearly inactive (11Groche, D. (1995) Characterization of the Iron Center and the Catalytic Mechanism of Peptide Deformylase from Escherichia coli.Doctoral dissertation, Universität Heidelberg.Google Scholar, 12Rajagopalan P.T.R. Yu X.C. Pei D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12418-12419Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fe2+ can be replaced by Ni2+ with a slight reduction in PDF activity (11Groche, D. (1995) Characterization of the Iron Center and the Catalytic Mechanism of Peptide Deformylase from Escherichia coli.Doctoral dissertation, Universität Heidelberg.Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the core domain (residues 1–147) of PDF was solved by NMR (8Meinnel T. Blanquet S. Dardel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the structure of the full-length protein by x-ray crystallography at 2.9-Å resolution (13Chan M.K. Gong W. Rajagopalan P.T.R. Hao B. Tsai C.M. Pei D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13904-13909Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Both structures describe the protein as isolated with a tightly bound zinc ion. We report the structure of the catalytically active enzyme in the nickel-bound form (PDF-Ni) at 2.5-Å resolution and at 1.9-Å resolution in complex with a polyethylene glycol molecule (PDF-Ni/PEG), shown here to be a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPDF-Ni (specific activity, 900 units/mg; 0.6 Ni2+ions per protein molecule) was isolated from overproducing E. coli cells and crystallized with 2 m(NH4)2SO4 as precipitant in the presence of 1% (w/v) PEG-1000 as described. 2Groche, D., Becker, A., Schlichting, I., Kabsch, W., Schultz, S., and Wagner, A. F. V. (1998) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., in press. Crystals were washed in 100 mm MOPS/NH3, 1% (w/v) PEG-1000, 2 m (NH4)2SO4 at pH 7.4. Three isomorphous derivatives were obtained by soaking crystals in the above buffer with added heavy atom compounds. The mercury derivative crystals were harvested after soaking 12 h in 0.1 mm ethylmercury phosphate (EMP), the platinum derivative after soaking 24 h in 2 mmK2PtCl4, and the double derivative after soaking 24 h in 0.1 mm CH3HgCl and 2 mm K2PtCl4. PDF-Ni crystals without PEG have been described.2Diffraction data were collected at room temperature by the rotation method and recorded by an electronic area detector (x-rays: CuKα, focused by Franks double-mirror optics; generator: GX-18, Elliot/Enraf-Nonius, Delft, operated at 35 kV/50 mA; detector: X100, Siemens/Nicolet, Madison, WI; crystal to detector distance: 10 cm; rotation/image: 0.0417° or 0.0833°). Integrated intensities were extracted from the rotation images by the program XDS (15Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3211) Google Scholar).Inhibition of PDF by PEG-1000 was determined by the following procedure. PDF activity was measured at 30 °C with formyl-Met (1–32 mm) at pH 7.2 (100 mm MOPS/NaOH, 2 mLi2SO4, 1 mm TCEP) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by 420 ng of PDF-Ni (5 μl) and stopped after 5 min by 4% HClO4 (50 μl). The amount of hydrolyzed substrate was determined according to the method of Fields (17Fields R. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzolsulfonic acid (ε420 = 22 mm−1cm−1). For inhibition studies, up to 10 mmPEG-1000, pretreated with TCEP (350 mm PEG/35 mm TCEP, pH 7.2) for 1 h, was included in the assay mixture. V max and apparent K M values were estimated from double-reciprocal plots (1/v versus 1/[S]), and the KI value was calculated from secondary replots of the slopes versusPEG-1000 concentrations.

DISCUSSIONSince its discovery about 30 years ago PDF is known to rapidly lose its activity, which makes its purification difficult (2Adams J.M. J. Mol.

In Goodpasture's (anti-glomerular basement membrane) disease, autoimmunity to the NC1 domain of the α3-chain of type IV collagen (α3(IV)NC1) is strongly associated with HLA-DR15. We have examined the influence of the peptide binding preferences of DR15 molecules on the selection of α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides displayed bound to DR15 molecules on the surface of α3(IV)NC1-pulsed DR15-homozygous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cells. The preferences of DR15 molecules were investigated using a panel of 24 overlapping peptides spanning the sequence of α3(IV)NC1. The α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides selected for display to T cells were determined by biochemical analysis as reported previously (Phelps, R. G., Turner, A. N., and Rees, A. J. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 18549–18553).Three nested sets of naturally presented α3(IV)NC1 peptides were detectable bound to DR15 molecules. Peptides representative of each nested set bound to DR15 molecules, but almost two-thirds of the α3(IV)NC1 peptides studied had as good or better DR15 affinity than those identified as naturally processed. Thus α3(IV)NC1 presentation to T cells is determined more by “processing factors” than by the preferences of relatively indiscriminate DR15 molecules. The results have important implications for the use of class II peptide binding data to aid identification of potential T cell epitopes, especially for antigens which, like α3(IV)NC1, contain many sequences able to bind class II molecules.

Antigen presenting cells (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APC, antigen presenting cells; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: APC, antigen presenting cells; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. potentially exert a profound influence on immune responses, including those to self antigens, because they regulate the way T cells recognize antigens. CD4 T cells recognize antigens in the form of processed peptides presented bound to MHC class II molecules on the surface of class II positive APC types (1Germain R.N. Margulies D.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 403-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar, 2Pieters J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These include cells important in the initiation of immune responses, such as dendritic cells, B cells, and macrophages, and cells important in regulating the T cell repertoire and self-tolerance, such as thymic epithelia. How APC select antigen-derived peptides for display to T cells therefore not only constrains the peptide specificity of responding T cells, but also influences the repertoire of T cells available to mount immune responses. Furthermore, the way APC present antigens may determine the immunodominant T cell response, which at least for some exogenous antigens is directed at the antigen-derived peptide displayed at the highest level (3Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7383Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). There is therefore great interest in understanding how APC generate antigen-derived peptides and make a selection for display to T cells, both as an approach to identifying T cell epitopes for specific immune modulation and toward understanding the basic biology of immune responses. APC, like many cell types, internalize extracellular proteins into their endosomal/lysosomal pathway where denaturing (low pH and reducing) conditions promote the access of endosomal proteases that degrade or “process” protein antigens into peptides and, ultimately, to amino acids and di-peptides (4Jensen P.E. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Watts C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 821-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). APC that express MHC class II genes target newly synthesized MHC class II molecules to processing compartments where they become competent to bind antigen-derived peptides and intact denatured proteins (6Harding C.V. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 16: 13-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides able to form stable complexes with class II molecules are protected from further proteolysis (7Mouritsen S. Meldal M. Werdelin O. Hansen A.S. Buus S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1987-1993PubMed Google Scholar, 8Donermeyer D.L. Allen P.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1063-1068PubMed Google Scholar) and may be transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD4 T cells. Accordingly, the selection of antigen-derived peptides displayed by APC is thought to be determined by an interplay between antigen denaturation and proteolysis (processing) on the one hand and MHC class II/peptide binding on the other. Antigen processing is poorly understood, and the range of antigen-derived peptides generated and made available for binding class II molecules is not yet known for any antigen. Few of the probably numerous endosomal proteases have been identified and their specificities characterized. Furthermore, how an antigen is processed is likely to depend not only upon its amino acid sequence but also on its tertiary and quaternary structure, which may influence susceptibility to denaturation and the access of endosomal proteases (9Simitsek P.D. Campbell D.G. Lanzavecchia A. Fairweather N. Watts C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 10Rouas N. Christophe S. Housseau F. Bellet D. Guillet J.-G.

In contrast, the way MHC class II molecules bind to peptides is well understood, and the ligands preferred by a particular class II molecule can fairly reliably be predicted. Class II molecules are heterodimeric membrane glycoproteins with an extracellular peptide binding groove (12Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Peptides are clasped with nine amino acid residues (the core binding sequence) accommodated in the groove, lying in extended conformation. Binding is largely stabilized by sequence nonspecific interactions with main chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the bound peptide. However, stable binding requires peptide side chain residues that point into the floor and walls of the groove to be accommodated in complementary pockets, the size and chemical character of which are extensively influenced by polymorphisms in class II alleles. Consequently, class II molecules bind a wide range of peptides but have allele-specific preferences for peptides with core binding sequences containing appropriately spaced, efficiently accommodated side chain residues (13Rammensee H.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Peptide binding preferences can be described using peptide binding motifs (14Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), and motifs have been developed for some class II molecules which fairly reliably predict the class II affinity of a peptide from its amino acid sequence (15Hammer J. Sturniolo T. Sinigaglia F. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 67-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp.

Protein Nucleic Acids. 1995; 1: 157-162PubMed Google Scholar). Thus while it is currently impossible to predict how an antigen will be processed by APC, it is relatively straightforward to identify the antigen-contained peptides which, if generated by processing, should be preferentially bound by class II molecules and hence selected for presentation to T cells. Antigen-contained sequences with high class II affinity can be identified by comparing the class II binding affinity of synthetic peptides with overlapping sequences spanning the sequence of an antigen or by using peptide binding motifs. Both approaches have been successful in identifying immunologically relevant T cell epitopes (16Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp.

Pusey C.D. Vaughan R.W. Rees A.J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 222-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We are examining how DR15-homozygous human APC process and present α3(IV)NC1 as an approach to identifying potential T cell epitopes and toward understanding how antigen processing and presentation and HLA genes influence susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Our approach has been to biochemically characterize DR15-associated peptides, purified from DR15-homozygous EBV-transformed human B cells, using matrix-assisted laser-desorption time of flight mass spectrometry and reverse phase HPLC (23Phelps R.G. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Comparison of peptides purified from α3(IV)NC1-pulsed and control non-pulsed APC identified 17 extra putative α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides. The difficulty with this approach is the low frequency of antigen-derived peptides; all the extra peptides occurred at low level within complex peptide mixtures, and their sequences could not be directly determined. However, by exploiting the tendency of class II-associated peptides to occur as nested sets, we were able to define the sequences of eight extra peptides. They comprised two nested sets centered on the common core sequences LFCNVNDVCNF and LEEFRASPF (24Phelps R.G. Jones V.J. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. Immunology. 1996; 89: 79Google Scholar). Here we have used overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 and matrix-based peptide binding motifs to identify all sequences within α3(IV)NC1 able to bind to DR15 molecules, and we ranked them according to DR15 affinity. Surprisingly, the peptides previously shown to be naturally processed from α3(IV)NC1 and selected for presentation bound to DR15 molecules have only intermediate DR15 affinity. Because DR15 molecules were expected to preferentially bind the available α3(IV)NC1 sequences for which they have greatest affinity, the biochemically detectable DR15-associated putative α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides purified from α3(IV)NC1-pulsed APC were re-analyzed for the possible occurrence of α3(IV)NC1 sequences with high DR15 affinity. The analysis identified a third nested set of naturally presented α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides. However, the most striking result was that most α3(IV)NC1 peptides with high DR15 affinity were undetectable among DR15-associated peptides purified from α3(IV)NC1-pulsed APC. Indeed, most of the naturally presented α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides bound to DR15 molecules have only intermediate affinity for DR15 molecules, both in the range of affinities measured for α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides and in the range of affinities reported for DR-associated peptides. Thus the peptide binding characteristics of DR15 molecules appear to be largely permissive in determining which α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides are displayed by DR15 APC, presumably sub-dominant to unknown processing factors. A panel of synthetic peptides was made with sequences spanning the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 (Table I). They were purified by HPLC and had their composition confirmed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption time of flight mass spectrometry. All the peptides were prepared as ∼1 mm solutions in 20% Me2SO, 5 mm dithiothreitol and stored at 4 °C because some had limited solubility in water and some tended to form disulfide-linked dimers. Stock peptide solutions were subjected to amino acid analysis to measure peptide concentrations more accurately. The peptides hemagglutinin 307–319 and myelin basic protein 86–98(98A), called HAP and MBPP respectively, were biotinylated at the N-terminal to make the labeled reference peptides designated *HAP and *MBPP.Table ISequences of peptides used in binding assaysNameFrom1-aNumbering is relative to the sequence SPAT… marking the beginning of the NC1 domain of α3(IV).ToLengthSequenceP112020SPATWTTRGFVFTRHSQTTAP2113121VFTRHSQTTAIPSCPEGTVPLP3214020IPSCPECTVPLYSGFSFLFVP3a183720TTAIPSCPEGTVPLYSGFSFP3b274822GTVPLYSGFSFLFVQGNQRAHGP4315020LYSGFSFLFVQCNQRAHCQDP5416020QGNQRAHGQDLGTLGSCLQRP6517020LGTLGSCLORFTTMPFLFCNP7618020FTTMPFLFCNVNDVCNFASRP8719121VNDVCNFASRNDYSYWLSTPAP98110020NDYSYWLSIPALMPMNMAPIP109111020ALMPMNMAPITGRALEPYISP1110112020TGRALEPYISRCTVCEGPAIP1211113020RCTVCEGPATATAVHSQTTDP1312114020ATAVHSQTTDIPPCPHGWISP1413115020IPPCPHCWISLWKGFSFIMEP1514116020LWKGFSFIMFTSAGSEGTGQP1615117020TSAGSEGTGQALASPGSCLEP1716118020ALASPGSCLEEFRASPFLECP1817119020EFRASPFLECHGRGTCNYYSP1918120020HGRGTCNYYSNSYSFWLASLP2019121020NSYSFWLASLNPERMFRKPIP2120122020NPERMFRKPIP3TVKAGELEP2221123020PSTVKAGELEKTTSRCQVCMP2322123414KTTSRCQVCMKKRHHA307–31913PKYVKQNTLKLATMBP86–98(98A)13NPVVHFFKNIVTA1-a Numbering is relative to the sequence SPAT… marking the beginning of the NC1 domain of α3(IV). Open table in a new tab Peptide retention times were measured using HPLC conditions identical to those described previously (23Phelps R.G. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Predicted retention times were calculated essentially as before, but incorporating retention time data for 11 more synthetic peptides, including peptides that overlapped all the α3(IV)NC1 sequences for which predicted retention times were calculated. Measured and predicted retention times exhibited a good fit to a linear model (R 2 = 0.93). Nonlinearity, for example due to secondary structure formation, was probably minimal for the sequences for which prediction was attempted as they all overlapped by at least 10 residues a synthetic peptide whose measured retention time was close to its predicted retention time. HLA-DR15a and -DR15b molecules were affinity purified from the murine L cell transfectants LDR2a and LDR2b, respectively (25Wilkinson D., DE Vries R.R.P. Madrigal A. Lock C.B. Morgenstern J.P. Trowsdale J. Altmann D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1442-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), because available monoclonal antibodies do not distinguish between the two DR molecules carried by human DR15 homozygous APC. DR15a is composed of the gene products of DRA and DRB5*0101 and DR15b of the gene products of DRA and DRB1*1501. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, containing protease inhibitors and DR molecules affinity purified employing the monoclonal antibody L243 conjugated to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. Peptide binding to purified class II molecules was measured using an inhibition assay based on that described by Tompkins et al. (26Tompkins S. Rota P. Moore J. Jensen P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 163: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The myelin basic protein peptide MBP86-98(98A) and flu hemagglutinin peptide HA307-319 were selected as reference peptides because of their reported high affinity for DR15b and DR15a, respectively (27Wucherpfennig K.W. Sette S. Southwood S. Oseroff C. Matsu M. Strominger J.L. Hafler D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The test peptides were incubated at a range of concentrations with affinity purified DR molecules (≈0.5 μm) and labeled reference peptides in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, in the presence of protease inhibitors for 16 h at 26 °C. The reference peptides were used at concentrations (160 nm for *MBPP and 86 nm for *HAP) at which much less than 10% bound to DR molecules. DR-reference peptide complexes were assayed by immobilizing DR-peptide complexes onto enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates coated with L243, labeling immobilized biotin with a streptavidin-Europium conjugate (Wallac Oy, Finland), and measuring Europium by time-resolved fluorescence at 613 nm (excitation at 340 nm). The concentrations of peptides [P i ] causing 50% reduction in reference peptide binding (IC50( i )) were extracted from experimental binding data by curve-fitting to functions of the formB/(1 + [P i ]/IC50( i )) whereB is binding in the absence of unlabeled test peptide (the equation derives from the law of mass action). IC50 values were determined in at least three independent experiments. Expressed as logarithms, the experimental data were normally distributed with S.D. 0.165, and the 95% confidence limits for the arithmetic means (three measurements) were ±0.19. Therefore the 95% confidence limits for measured IC50 values (in moles) were between (mean/1.5) and (mean × 1.5). To compare measurements of affinity with those of other researchers, it was necessary to determine an absolute measurement of peptide class II affinity (IC50 measurements are dependent upon the experimental conditions used). When both reference peptide (Pref) and test peptides (P i ) are used in excess of available class II, the (inhibition) dissociation constant (K d ( i )) of the complex DR·P i is related to the measured IC50 by the formula K d ( i ) = IC50( i )/(1 + [Pref]/K d (ref)) where [Pref] is the concentration of reference peptide andK d (ref) is the equilibrium dissociation constant of DR-reference peptide complexes. TheK d (ref) values of *HAP/DR15a and *MBPP/DR15b were estimated to be 5 and 16 nm, respectively, by Hill transformation of binding measured at a range of concentrations of reference peptides. Therefore, for comparison purposes,K i ∼IC50/11 for DR15b inhibition assays and IC50/18 for DR15a assays. Other procedures were as described previously (23Phelps R.G. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of the peptide binding characteristics of DR15 molecules in shaping the selection of α3(IV)NC1 peptides displayed to T cells by DR15 homozygous APC, we sought to identify all peptides within the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 with good affinity for DR15 molecules and analyze the results in the light of our previous biochemical characterization of naturally processed α3(IV)NC1-derived peptides (23Phelps R.G. Turner A.N. Rees A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because that study examined peptides eluted from DR15 molecules purified from α3(IV)NC1-pulsed MGAR cells (a line of EBV-transformed human B cells homozygous for DR15), and hence peptides that could have been bound to DR15a or DR15b molecules, it was necessary to examine peptide binding to both DR15a and DR15b molecules separately. Two complementary approaches were used. First, a set of synthetic peptides was made with overlapping sequences spanning the sequence of α3(IV)NC1. They were compared for their capacity to inhibit the binding of labeled reference peptides to affinity purified DR15a and DR15b molecules. Second, the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 was examined for peptides with high predicted affinity for DR15a or DR15b molecules using matrix based motifs to identify any peptides likely to bind well but inadequately represented within the set of overlapping peptides. Synthetic peptides were made with the sequences shown in Table I. Peptides P1 to P23 are 20 to 21 amino acids in length (except P23) and span the sequence of α3(IV)NC1 with a mostly 10-residue overlap. This degree of overlap was chosen to slightly exceed the length of bound peptide accommodated within the class II peptide binding groove (12Madden D.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 587-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Peptide P3 proved difficult to synthesize in any quantity and poorly soluble in aqueous buffers, so P3 was substituted by peptides P3a and P3b. Seventeen of the 24 peptides examined bound to DR15b molecules with varying degrees of affinity (Fig. 1). Four of the peptides bound with high affinity and 13 with intermediate affinity, defined by the previously reported range of affinities for peptide-class II interactions (see legend to Fig. 1). The assay conditions permitted measurement of IC50 for peptides with IC50 <∼100 μm, so did not distinguish low affinity binding (IC50 >100 μm andK i >6–12 μm) from non-binding. Seventeen peptides also bound to DR15a molecules, but a higher proportion (9/24) bound with high affinity. This could be because the β-chain of DR15a has a glycine at position β86 which is smaller than the valine at β86 in DR15b and permits the P1 pocket of DR15a to more easily accommodate bulky hydrophobic side chains, especially aromatic residues, further stabilizing peptide binding (28Hammer J. Belunis C. Bolin D. Papadopoulos J. Walsky R. Higelin J. Danho W. Sinigaglia F. Nagy Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4456-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All but one of the high DR15a affinity peptides (P10) contain aromatic amino acids at positions able to engage in the P1 pocket of the DR15a peptide binding groove, whereas P10 has suitably placed methionine residues. Only four peptides (P2, P13, P16, and P23) had no detectable binding to either DR15 molecule. The sequence of α3(IV)NC1 was also examined using matrix-based DR15 peptide binding motifs. This was done first to identify the probable core binding sequences of the α3(IV)NC1 peptides with high affinity for DR15 molecules, and second to ensure all α3(IV)NC1 sequences with high DR15 affinity had been identified. While every nine amino acid core binding sequence in α3(IV)NC1 was represented within the set of synthetic peptides, it was possible that different α3(IV)NC1 peptides would bind to DR15 with higher affinity, perhaps through making fewer unfavorable interactions outside the groove. Predicted DR15a binding affinity was calculated for each of the 226 nine amino acid core sequences in α3(IV)NC1 using the methods and matrix coefficients of Marshall et al. (17Marshall K. Wilson K. Liang J. Woods A. Zaller D. Rothbard J. Biomed. Pept. Protein Nucleic Acids. 1995; 1: 157-162PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 a). Thirteen core sequences were identified with predicted DR15a binding affinity better than 10 nm. Twelve of the 13 occurred within the sequences of the four synthetic peptides (peptides P4, P9, P15, and P20) with highest measured DR15a affinity, indicating a good correspondence between the prediction algorithm and experimental results for α3(IV)NC1 peptides. The measured and predicted DR15a affinities of the other α3(IV)NC1 peptides also showed a close correspondence (data not shown). The other core sequence with predicted DR15a binding affinity better than 10 nm was LQRFTTMPF which was within peptide P6 which bound DR15a with only intermediate affinity. Similar matrix-based motifs for DR15b are not yet published preventing an exactly similar analysis of α3(IV)NC1 binding to DR15b. To identify the sequences in α3(IV)NC1 with highest predicted affinity for DR15b, we used an unpublished matrix-based motif in collaboration with T. Sturniolo and co-workers. 3T. Sturniolo, J. Hammer, and F. Sinigaglia (Roche Milano Ricerche, Milan), unpublished data. The motif utilized binding data acquired as previously reported (16Hammer J. Bono E. Gallazzi F. Belunis C. Nagy Z. Sinigaglia F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2353-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), but predicted binding was calculated using a refined algorithm as recently described (15Hammer J. Sturniolo T. Sinigaglia F. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 66: 67-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The three core sequences in α3(IV)NC1 with highest predicted DR15b affinity are shown in Fig. 2 b. One of these, FIMFTSAGS, occurred within the synthetic peptide with highest measured DR15b affinity (P15). The other two core sequences were well represented within peptides (P3b and P6) that had intermediate affinity for DR15b molecules (ranked 6th and 8th out of 24, respectively). Importantly, neither motif analysis identified α3(IV)NC1 peptides with high predicted DR15a/b affinity that were not well represented in the set of overlapping peptides, so the measured DR15 affinities of the set of synthetic peptides could reasonably be used to rank α3(IV)NC1 peptides according to DR15a or DR15b affinity. The four peptides with highest affinity for DR15a and for DR15b are shown in TableII. The P1 residues of their probable core binding sequences identified by the motif analysis are underlined.Table IIα3(IV)NC1 peptides with highest affinity for DR15a/b moleculesClass II moleculePeptidePosition in α3(IV)NC1SequenceRank (/24) affinity toFromToDR15bDR15aDR15bP15141160LWKGFSFIMFTSAGSEGTGQ14P11101120TGRALEPYTSRCTVCEGPAL2182-aOne of six peptides that did not detectably bind to DR15b.P19181200HGRGTCNYYSNSYSFWLASL36P14131150IPPCPHGWISLWKGFSFIMF415DR15aP20191210NSYSFWLASLNPERMFRKPI171P43150LYSGFSFLFVQGNQRAHGQD72P981100NDYSYWLSIPALMDMNMAPI123P15141160LWKGFSFIMFTSAGSEGTGQ142-a One of six peptides that did not detectably bind to DR15b.

https://openalex.org/W2164464595,"Abstract The pre-steady-state reaction ofDictyostelium nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase with dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTP) and AZT triphosphate was studied by quenching of protein fluorescence after manual mixing or by stopped flow. The fluorescence signal, which is correlated with the phosphorylation state of the catalytic histidine in the enzyme active site, decreases upon ddNTP addition according to a monoexponential time course. The pseudo-first order rate constant was determined for different concentrations of the various ddNTPs and was found to be saturable. The data are compatible with a two-step reaction scheme, where fast association of the enzyme with the dideoxynucleotide is followed by a rate-limiting phosphorylation step. The rate constants and dissociation equilibrium constants determined for each dideoxynucleotide were correlated with the steady-state kinetic parameters measured in the enzymatic assay in the presence of the two substrates. It is shown that ddNTPs and AZT triphosphate are poor substrates for NDP kinase with a rate of phosphate transfer of 0.02 to 3.5 s−1 and a K S of 1–5 mm. The equilibrium dissociation constants for ADP, GDP, ddADP, and ddGDP were also determined by fluorescence titration of a mutant F64W NDP kinase, where the introduction of a tryptophan at the nucleotide binding site provides a direct spectroscopic probe. The lack of the 3′-OH in ddNTP causes a 10-fold increase inK D. Contrary to “natural” NTPs, NDP kinase discriminates between various ddNTPs, with ddGTP the more efficient and ddCTP the least efficient substrate within a range of 100 ink cat values."

Signal peptides that direct transport of bacterial proteins across a non-Sec export pathway possess an N domain RRXFLK consensus motif. Recent genetic studies suggest an evolutionary link between these two protein translocation pathways. To further explore this relationship, we examined the thylakoid targeting capability of the signal peptide for Escherichia colihydrogenase 1 small subunit (HyaA) by linking it to plastocyanin and assaying the chimeric protein in an in vitro thylakoid transport assay. The chimeric precursor was transported across thylakoids with high efficiency. Transport was characteristic of the Delta pH but not the Sec pathway, i.e. it was eliminated by ionophores that dissipate the ΔpH but occurred in the absence of stromal extract or ATP. This result was confirmed by competition with chemical quantities of a Delta pH pathway precursor. This indicates that the HyaA signal peptide has the necessary elements for efficient and exclusive targeting to the Delta pH pathway and further supports the notion that the alternate targeting pathways in prokaryotes and plant thylakoids are analogous.

Many thylakoid lumen-resident proteins of plant chloroplasts are synthesized in the cytosol as larger precursors with bipartite amino-terminal extensions called transit peptides (see Ref. 1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar for review). The stroma-targeting domain of the transit peptide governs import into the chloroplast stroma; the lumen-targeting domain directs subsequent transport into the thylakoid lumen. Two precursor-specific pathways for protein transport into the thylakoid lumen have been identified by in vitro and genetic studies (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The thylakoid Sec pathway requires a chloroplast SecA protein (cpSecA) and ATP (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and appears analogous to the bacterial Sec system. The Delta pH pathway operates independently of ATP and soluble factors, requiring only a thylakoidal pH gradient (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Targeting specificity for the two pathways is determined primarily by the lumen-targeting domains, which contain motifs of bacterial signal peptides, i.e. an amino-terminal charged N domain, a hydrophobic H domain, and a carboxyl-terminal cleavage C domain (2von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Precursors targeted to the Delta pH pathway invariably contain an essential N domain twin arginine that provides access to the Delta pH pathway (Fig.1) (3Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, Delta pH pathway precursors have H and/or C domains that are nonfunctional for Sec pathway transport (4Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These latter elements have been termed “Sec-avoidance” elements (4Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A non-Sec protein export pathway also appears to operate in bacteria. Nivière et al. (6Nivière V. Wong S.-L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) showed that a chimeric precursor containing the Desulfovibrio vulgaris hydrogenase small subunit signal peptide fused to β-lactamase was exported efficiently only under anaerobic conditions and this export depended upon a critical N domain twin arginine motif. Export of Pseudomonas stutzeri nitrous oxide reductase also depends upon an N domain RR (7Dreusch A. Bürgisser D.M. Heizmann C.W. Zumft W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that trimethylamine N-oxide reductase, which bears an N domain twin arginine, is exported by a mechanism independent of SecA, SecY, or SecE, but dependent on the transmembrane ΔμH+ (8Santini C.-L Ize B. Chanal A. Müller M. Giordano G. Wu L.-F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Berks (9Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) pointed out that many precursors for bacterial proteins that bind redox cofactors share a conserved N domain (S/T)RRXFLK motif (Fig.1) and suggested that the export system for such proteins may be related to the thylakoid Delta pH pathway. Strong support for such a notion was recently provided by Settles et al. (10Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martinssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Maize Hcf106 mutant chloroplasts are selectively defective in the Delta pH pathway. The Hcf106 protein has striking homology to several open reading frames from bacterial genomes. In the case of Azotobacter chroococcum, mutation of the Hcf106 homologue results in mislocalization of hydrogenase (10Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martinssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Here we show that the signal peptide of Escherichia colihydrogenase 1 small subunit (HyaA) is functionally equivalent to a lumen-targeting domain for chloroplast Delta pH pathway precursors. This indicates that the HyaA signal peptide has the essential elements that both engage the Delta pH pathway and avoid the Sec pathway. All reagents, enzymes, and standards were purchased commercially.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the chimeric precursors t23-PC and DT-PC (5Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were previously described. For tOE23 expression in E. coli, the coding sequence was amplified from the transcription plasmid with a forward primer that contained an NdeI site encompassing the initiator methionine codon and a reverse primer that also contained aHindIII restriction site. The PCR product was cloned into the NdeI/HindIII sites of pETH3c (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Expression of tOE23 in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and isolation of inclusion bodies were as described (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The HyaA coding sequence (13Menon N.K. Robbins J. Wendt J.C. Shanmugam K.T. Przybyla A.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4851-4861Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with E. coli genomic DNA as template and cloned into pGEM-3z. PCR splicing by overlap extension (SOE) (14Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) was used to construct a chimeric precursor, Hya-PC, which is an exact fusion between coding sequences for the HyaA signal peptide and the mature domain of Arabidopsis PC. DNA fragments corresponding to the signal peptide and to PC were amplified separately and spliced in a second round of PCR. Forward and reverse primers for the SOE reaction contained restrictions sites for HindIII andSstI sites, respectively, and the SOE product was cloned into the HindIII and SstI sites of pGEM-3z. The sequences of all PCR-cloned constructs were confirmed by TaqDyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing. Capped RNA for the various precursors was produced in vitro with SP6 polymerase and uncut plasmid. Precursors were translated in a wheat germ system in the presence of [3H]leucine and adjusted to import buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sorbitol) containing 30 mm unlabeled leucine prior to use (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts and thylakoids were prepared from pea seedlings as described (15Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transport of radiolabeled proteins into thylakoids was conducted with chloroplast lysates or washed thylakoids in 75-μl assays (12Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Precursors and recovered thylakoid membranes were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Quantification was accomplished by scintillation counting of radiolabeled proteins extracted from excised gel bands (15Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We initially assayed transport of the HyaA precursor protein into isolated thylakoids. A low level of transport was achieved as determined by expected proteolytic maturation and protection from exogenous protease (data not shown). However, this low level of transport was insufficient for a full examination of the targeting properties. Because the focus here was on the targeting capability of the signal peptide of HyaA, we constructed a chimeric precursor protein (Hya-PC) possessing the HyaA signal peptide fused to the mature domain of Arabidopsis PC. PC was chosen as a passenger protein because it can be transported on the Sec pathway and the Delta pH pathway when linked to appropriate signal peptides (4Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows a thylakoid transport assay with Hya-PC. Incubation of Hya-PC with isolated thylakoids produced a smaller product at the location of mature PC (lane 2) that was resistant to thermolysin treatment of the membranes (lane 3). Mature PC was recovered in the lumen subfraction when the recovered thylakoids were sonicated to release the lumenal contents (lane 7). Mature PC was not produced when assays were conducted in the presence of ionophores (lane 4), and the membrane-associated precursor was degraded by thermolysin (lane 5). Fig. 2 also shows control assays for translocation/integration of authentic pPC and the membrane protein LHCP. These assays demonstrate that the HyaA signal peptide directs transport into the thylakoid lumen. Average transport of Hya-PC for three experiments was 32% of the added precursor. This compares very favorably with the 16% of t23-PC transport (Fig. 3, lane 3) for the same three experiments. t23-PC is a fusion protein between the core targeting peptide for the Delta pH substrate OE23 and the mature domain of Arabidopsis PC (5Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Figure 3Transport requirements suggest that Hya-PC is transported by the Delta pH pathway. Transport of precursors across thylakoid membranes was conducted for 30 min at 25 °C with chloroplast lysate to provide stromal extract (SE) or washed thylakoids. Energy was provided in the form of ATP and/or light to generate a ΔpH. Assay conditions examined the requirement for a ΔpH (lane 4), ATP (lane 5), stromal extract (lane 6), and sensitivity to azide (lane 7). Final concentrations were 5 mm ATP, 10 mmsodium azide, 0.5 μm nigericin (nig), and 1 μm valinomycin (val). Apyrase (0.5 unit per 75 μl) was used to eliminate residual ATP in lysate and translation products for assays conducted in the absence of ATP. These conditions are designated above the panel. Recovered thylakoids were post-treated with thermolysin. Analysis and designations were as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Assays in Fig. 3 were conducted under a variety of conditions designed to assess energy and stroma requirements that are characteristic for thylakoid translocation pathways. As with t23-PC (a Delta pH pathway substrate), transport of Hya-PC was completely abolished by addition of ionophores that dissipate the thylakoidal ΔpH (lane 4), but was unaffected by the addition of sodium azide (lane 7), a SecA inhibitor (16Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), or by removal of the stromal extract (lane 6). Depletion of ATP with apyrase in these experiments diminished, but did not abolish, Hya-PC transport (lane 5). A similar reduction of t23-PC in the presence of apyrase also occurred. Such an effect was not previously recognized for t23-PC (5Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) but appears to be related to the PC mature domain because in parallel assays, tOE23 transport was not reduced by apyrase (data not shown). In contrast, transport of the Sec pathway substrate pPC was only marginally affected by ionophores (lane 4), virtually eliminated by removal of ATP or of stromal extract, the source of ∼90% of the cpSecA (lanes 5 and 6), and inhibited by azide (lane 7). These requirements suggest that Hya-PC is transported on the Delta pH pathway rather than the Sec pathway. In addition, Hya-PC transport requirements rule out the participation of two other pathways that are responsible for insertion of membrane proteins (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); i.e. membrane integration by the chloroplast SRP is absolutely dependent on the presence of stroma and NTPs, whereas membrane integration by a spontaneous mechanism occurs even in the absence of a thylakoidal ΔpH. To further clarify the pathway utilized by Hya-PC, competition assays were conducted with bacterially synthesized tOE23 (Fig. 4 A). Increasing concentrations of tOE23 progressively competed transport of t23-PC and Hya-PC. At 2 μm tOE23, transport of Hya-PC was reduced to ∼5% of that achieved in the absence of competitor. In contrast, transport of Sec pathway substrates pPC and iOE33 was unaffected by tOE23 competitor. To determine if the residual Hya-PC transport in the presence of 2 μm tOE23 competitor was mediated by the Sec pathway, the effect of ATP and stromal extract were assessed in the presence of 2 μm tOE23 (Fig. 4 B). DT-PC transport served as a positive control for this experiment. DT-PC is a chimeric precursor protein that contains the N domain of the OE23 precursor and the H/C and mature domains of PC. Importantly, DT-PC is transported by both the Sec and the Delta pH pathways (5Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the absence of stromal extract, tOE23 competitor substantially reduced transport of Hya-PC and DT-PC (lanes 4–7). As expected, addition of stromal extract greatly stimulated the DT-PC residual transport (lane 8), and this stimulation was largely eliminated by removal of ATP (lane 9) or inclusion of sodium azide (lane 10). These three effects are characteristic of Sec transport as exemplified by the control assays with iOE33. In contrast to these results, the residual Hya-PC transport was unaffected by the addition of stroma extract, the removal of ATP, or the inclusion of azide. This demonstrates that Hya-PC is not transported by the cpSecA-dependent mechanism even when the transport on the Delta pH pathway is virtually eliminated by competition. Furthermore, these results indicate that the reduction of transport of Hya-PC and t23-PC by apyrase seen in Fig. 3 does not reflect the involvement of the cpSecA translocation ATPase. Taken together, these results indicate that Hya-PC is exclusively targeted to the Delta pH pathway and does not utilize the Sec pathway (or other thylakoidal pathways). Thus, the signal peptide for HyaA is functionally equivalent to the Delta pH pathway lumen-targeting domain and contains the two essential elements required for exclusive targeting, an N domain twin arginine (3Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) that provides access to the Delta pH pathway and an element that prevents engagement by the Sec pathway. It was uncertain whether the N domain twin arginine in the HyaA signal peptide would be functional for the Delta pH pathway because it is followed by several amino acids, SFLK, prior to the H domain. For most Delta pH pathway precursors, the twin arginine immediately precedes the first amino acid of the H domain. Furthermore, a chimeric construct that placed an asparagine between the twin arginine motif and the H domain was nonfunctional for Delta pH pathway transport (4Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the HyaA signal peptide was twice as efficient as the authentic core signal peptide for Delta pH pathway precursor OE23. It is likely, but remains to be demonstrated, that the thylakoid Sec avoidance element in the HyaA signal peptide resides in the H/C domain. Because of the endosymbiotic origin of chloroplasts from an ancestral cyanobacterium, it was speculated that protein transport into plant thylakoids would be evolutionarily related to prokaryotic transport mechanisms. Work during the past several years has shown that three of the four known mechanisms of thylakoid protein translocation can be ascribed to prokaryote mechanisms. These include a SecA-dependent pathway, an SRP-like pathway for insertion of a membrane protein, and a spontaneous protein insertion mechanism (1Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Although characteristics of the thylakoid Delta pH pathway suggest a prokaryote-like mechanism, i.e. a classical signal peptide and initiation via a loop mechanism (17Fincher V. McCaffery M. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), no analogous system had been identified in bacteria. The recent report of the identity of the Hcf106 protein involved in Delta pH pathway, and the existence of the bacterial homologues (10Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martinssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) now suggests the identity of the bacterial counterpart. Our results further support the notion that the pathway associated with export of redox cofactor-binding proteins in bacteria is related to the Delta pH pathway of chloroplast thylakoids. We thank Shan Wu for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1980750447,"Although it is known that virtually all exported proteins require a signal peptide, it is not clearly understood how the signal peptide interfaces with the translocation machinery to achieve transport. In this study we document a direct interaction between the signal peptide and SecA, a primary component of the translocase inEscherichia coli, and show that the signal peptide itself can stimulate SecA-lipid ATPase activity. Using synthetic signal peptides corresponding to the wild type alkaline phosphatase signal sequence and two model sequences, we find that the extent of stimulation of SecA ATPase activity by the different peptides parallels the hierarchy of results found for in vivo function (Izard, J. W., Doughty, M. B., and Kendall, D. A. (1995)Biochemistry 34, 9904–9912). The peptide-induced activity requires a lipid to protein molar ratio of at least 300:1 and liposomes enriched in negatively charged phospholipids. Furthermore, specific binding of the signal peptide to SecA was demonstrated using chemical cross-linking and competition with unlabeled peptides.

Furthermore, specific binding of the signal peptide to SecA was demonstrated using chemical cross-linking and competition with unlabeled peptides. The most striking link among all exported proteins is the requirement for a signal peptide. Yet understanding how signal peptides function has been hampered by complexities inherent in all systems. First, signal peptides participate in multiple steps in the transport process and come into contact with a variety of different environments such as the aqueous cytoplasmic milieu, the charged surface of a membrane, and its apolar interior. Second, signal peptides have been implicated in a number of different protein-protein interactions: with their own attached proteins to delay folding, with components of the ribosomal complex, the translocation machinery, and with leader peptidase (1Izard J.W. Kendall D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Few in vitro systems have directly documented and characterized these interactions in a way that can be convincingly related to the biological system. Thus, these fundamental issues remain unanswered. With what components do signal peptides directly interact and what is the mechanistic outcome of these interactions? For Escherichia coli, it is of particular interest to delineate how a transported protein is recognized by SecA (2Oliver D.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Wickner W. Leonard M.R. J. Biol.

This multifunctional protein interfaces with the cytoplasmic chaperone SecB (4Randall L.L. Topping T.B. Hardy S.J.S. Pavlov M.Y. Freistroffer D.V. Ehrenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11302-11306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At the membrane level, the ATPase activity of SecA appears critical for translocation of the nascent chain, perhaps through successive rounds of binding and release of the preprotein (10Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). To date, however, specific binding of the signal peptide region of a translocating polypeptide to SecA has only been inferred from studies involving mutations in SecA that relieve signal peptide defects (11Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), cross-linking with preproteins (7Mori H. Araki M. Hikita C. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that signal peptides alone are not substrates for SecA and that stimulation of the ATPase activity also requires the presence of the mature protein (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 14Cunningham K. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8630-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we employ synthetic peptides corresponding to the signal sequence of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and idealized model signal peptides that we have previously characterized with regard to a number of physical parameters (15Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we demonstrate that peptides corresponding to functional signal sequences (but not nonfunctional ones) bind SecA and stimulate its ATPase activity in liposomes. Significant activity requires at least a 300-fold molar excess of lipid over SecA and negatively charged phospholipid. However, no mature portion of an exported protein is required for the peptide-induced stimulation. All media and culture conditions for the overproduction and purification of SecA from E. coli strain BL21-14 have been described (16Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The SecA concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient E = 0.805 ml mg−1 cm−1 at 280 nm or by the Bradford assay at 595 nm (17Bradford M.M. Anal.

The amino-terminal group of the wild type peptide was radiolabeled with [3H]acetic anhydride in N-methylpyrrolidine essentially as described by Seligman (19Seligman S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 324-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The cross-linking of APDP to the labeled peptide was carried out as described by the manufacturer with minor modification. A Kwik Sep polyacrylamide 1800 desalting column (Pierce) was used for final purification. SecA (160 pmol) in the ATPase assay buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min with the APDP-labeled, tritiated, wild type peptide andE. coli phospholipid (1.2 mg/ml) in the dark. Competition experiments were carried out similarly except that a 10-fold excess of cold peptide was also present. Subsequently, photoactivation was accomplished by UV illumination for 5 min. Cross-linked complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and liquid scintillation counting of solubilized gel slices. The synthetic peptides used in this study include one corresponding to the wild type sequence of the alkaline phosphatase signal peptide and two that are model signal sequences, each containing a carboxyl-terminal cysteine for incorporation of a photoaffinity label (Table I). The latter two peptides (3K7L and 1K2L) were designed to have simple sequences while maintaining the prominent physical characteristics of E. coli signal peptides in general. They differ from each other by containing different proportions of leucine and alanine residues to represent functional and nonfunctional core regions, respectively, as determined previously using in vivo analysis (15Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These two peptides also differ in amino-terminal charge (+1 versus +3), but this results in no observable difference in transport efficiencyin vivo. To demonstrate binding of synthetic signal peptides to SecA, several challenges had to be considered. Previous studies indicated that SecA needed to be associated with lipids to produce an active form and potentially to produce the conformation which recognizes the signal peptide (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 6Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we needed to be able to distinguish specific binding to SecA from nonspecific binding of the peptides to either SecA or lipid. These problems were addressed, in part, using SecA ATPase activity as a functional indicator of signal peptide binding in liposomes as had been done with preproteins previously (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar,20Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the effects of the different synthetic peptides on SecA ATPase activity in the presence of the synthetic phospholipids DOPC:DOPG (molar ratio 1:1) at 150 μg/ml. Under these initial experimental conditions, maximum stimulation of SecA-lipid ATPase by the functional 3K7L and wild type alkaline phosphatase peptides corresponded to 70 and 58 pmol of Pi released/min/μg of SecA, respectively, and occurred at a peptide concentration of 30 μm. No significant increase in ATPase activity was observed in the presence of up to 90 μmof the nonfunctional 1K2L peptide. No response with 3K2L, another nonfunctional peptide (15Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was obtained over the same concentration range (data not shown). These results suggest that the interaction of the signal peptide and SecA in lipid is sufficient to stimulate the ATPase activity and that the functional, hydrophobic signal peptides have markedly higher affinity for SecA than nonfunctional ones. Furthermore, the enhancement in ATPase activity observed by the 3K7L peptide relative to the wild type signal peptide may be related to the especially strong helical potential of the former in nonpolar environments (15Izard J.W. Doughty M.B. Kendall D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9904-9912Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The peptide-induced ATPase activity was further optimized by reducing the Mg2+ concentration to 0.5 mm and using freshly prepared and aliquoted peptide stock solutions (maximum one freeze/thaw cycle). Under these conditions, a peptide concentration of 20 μm and DOPC:DOPG (1:1) at 150 μg/ml, the peptide-stimulated ATPase activities were increased more than 4-fold, the 3K7L-induced activity was 270 pmol of Pireleased/min/μg of SecA, and the wild type peptide-induced activity was 250 pmol of Pi released/min/μg of SecA. These levels are comparable to what has been observed with preprotein previously (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The response with 1K2L was negligible at 7 pmol of Pireleased/min/μg of SecA. The effects of lipid concentration and composition on the 3K7L peptide-stimulated SecA ATPase activity are shown in Fig.2. Keeping the concentration of SecA and peptide constant, we observed a direct dependence of the peptide-induced SecA ATPase activity on lipid concentration. At concentrations less than 80 μg/ml lipid the effect of the peptide was somewhat inhibitory whereas above 120 μg/ml lipid (corresponding to a lipid to SecA molar ratio of about 300:1) the peptide was stimulatory. The ATPase activity continues to increase up to 320 μg/ml lipid (corresponding to a lipid to SecA molar ratio of 900:1), the highest concentration used in this study. The trend was similar for DOPE:DOPG (3:1) and DOPC:DOPG (3:1) and slightly enhanced for lipids extracted from E. coli (PE:PG:cardiolipin about 3:1:0.5). These findings have several implications. First, it underlines the requirement that SecA be sufficiently ensconced in lipid to form an ATPase active form (6Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It does not necessarily mean that the lipid is needed to produce the signal peptide binding form, only that our means of assaying binding requires it. Second, it provides an explanation as to why signal peptide stimulation of SecA ATPase activity was obscured previously. We estimate that in earlier work (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) the lipid to SecA ratio was below the threshold required to see an effect of the signal peptide alone and that the overall lipid to protein ratio was further reduced by high concentrations of peptide. That SecA is so sensitive to relative lipid concentration, particularly in small liposomes with a high radius of curvature, is not surprising given its size (102 kDa) and its pronounced integration into the bilayer (6Ulbrandt N.D. London E. Oliver D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15184-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Third, that the peptide-induced ATPase activity is enhanced (rather than diminished) at higher lipid content argues that the stimulation is due to a direct effect of the peptide on SecA as opposed to a secondary effect on SecA due to lipid perturbation as peptide partitions into the bilayer. In the latter case, we would have expected the effect to be diminished when more lipid is used, effectively diluting the SecA and peptide concentrations. Several studies have pointed to a role for negatively charged phospholipids in protein translocation in E. coli using bothin vivo (23de Vrije T. de Swart R.L. Dowhan W. Tommassen J. de Kruijff B. Nature. 1988; 334: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and in vitro (5Lill R. Dowhan W. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 7Mori H. Araki M. Hikita C. Tagaya M. Mizushima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Phoenix D.A. Kusters R. Hikita C. Mizushima S. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17069-17073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) systems for analysis. The dependence of the signal peptide-stimulated SecA ATPase activity on the amount of the anionic lipid, PG (relative to PE), is shown in Fig. 3. Indeed, for the 3K7L peptide, SecA ATPase activity was enhanced as the PG content of the liposomes was increased up to a molar fraction of 0.4, which corresponds to a PE:PG molar ratio of 3:2. No such effect was observed with the nonfunctional 1K2L peptide. Interestingly, optimum activity occurs over a fairly narrow range of PG content (PG molar fraction of 0.4 to 0.6). The increased activity observed with PG may reflect enhanced association of the positively charged peptides with the liposomes and/or may be due to a preferred SecA conformation produced by the presence of sufficient anionic lipids. Unfavorable charge repulsion of neighboring PG molecules among themselves to produce nonbilayer structures (25Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980Google Scholar) or of PG and the anionic SecA could account for the reduced stimulation observed at very high PG levels. Chemical cross-linking analyses further indicate that the functional signal peptides are interacting with SecA in a direct and specific manner. Incubation of 3H-labeled wild type peptide carrying the photoaffinity label APDP, with liposomes and SecA, followed by UV photoactivation, resulted in substantial cross-linking of the radiolabeled peptide to SecA (Fig. 4). When the experiment is repeated in the presence of a 10-fold excess of unlabeled wild type peptide (carrying neither the [3H]acetyl nor APDP groups), 40% of the labeled peptide is displaced and not cross-linked. This is approximately half of the displacement theoretically expected from an optimal competition between identical species or precisely the amount expected if the labeled peptide has an affinity for SecA that is only twice that of the unlabeled one. To have achieved such high levels of displacement in our experiments is quite remarkable considering that the labels render the peptide more hydrophobic than its unlabeled counterpart and because the illumination and separation of bound ligand from free is not instantaneous. Therefore, covalent complex formation of the labeled peptide and SecA can continue, precluding an “off” state during which the unlabeled peptide could continue to compete. In contrast, excess 1K2L or a control peptide with the sequence HVLTPVEK displaced only 10% and 9%, respectively, of the labeled wild type peptide. Furthermore, APDP-mediated cross-linking of the wild type peptide to SecA in the absence and presence of lipid is very similar (10, 877 cpm and 9, 494 cpm, respectively) indicating that the lipid does not alter the extent of association of the peptide with SecA. These studies are the first to demonstrate that the signal peptide region alone can bind SecA and stimulate ATPase activity. This does not mean that the mature region does not also bind SecA, only that it is not required for the signal peptide interaction. During the initial association of the preprotein with the membrane, SecA might act as a funnel, in the metaphorical sense. It makes sense that the signal peptide binds SecA and would do so with higher affinity, relative to the mature region, because it may well be the first part of the preprotein that is exposed to translocation sites. This initial interaction can then serve to localize and concentrate the preprotein at the translocon for subsequent translocation steps, which may include interactions with other regions of the preprotein. We thank Donald Oliver for critically reading this manuscript and Carol Teschke and Shannon Doyle for providing some of the SecA used in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2079779312,"During the last interglacial, Antarctic climate changed before that of the Northern Hemisphere. Large local changes in precession forcing could have produced this pattern if there were a rectified response in sea ice cover. Results from a coupled sea ice–ocean general circulation model supported this hypothesis when it was tested for three intervals around the last interglacial. Such a mechanism may play an important role in contributing to phase offsets between Northern and Southern Hemisphere climate change for other time intervals."

Cell surface glycoaminoglycans have been implicated as one of the heterophilic ligands for PECAM-1. To determine whether PECAM-1 is capable of interacting directly with glycosaminoglycans, we examined the adhesive properties of multiple monovalent and multivalent forms of this adhesion molecule. We found that the binding of a bivalent PECAM-1/IgG chimeric protein or multivalent PECAM-1-containing proteoliposomes to multiple different cell lines was 1) strictly dependent upon cell surface expression of PECAM-1 and 2) unaffected by the presence of excess heparin or heparan sulfate. The extracellular domain of PECAM-1 failed to interact specifically with heparin-Sepharose, 3H-labeled heparin, or a heparin-bovine serum albumin conjugate. In addition, an amino acid sequence motif inadvertently created by the juxtaposition of PECAM-1 and IgG sequences within the hinge region of certain PECAM-1/IgG chimeric constructs was found to confer glycosaminoglycan binding properties not normally present within the extracellular domain of the native molecule. Together, these data suggest that the mechanism by which heparin is able to affect PECAM-1-dependent cell-cell adhesion is indirect and occurs via inhibition of events that occur downstream from PECAM-1 engagement.

PECAM-1 (CD31) is a 130-kDa member of the Ig gene superfamily that is constitutively expressed on the surface of circulating platelets, monocytes, neutrophils, and selected T cell subsets. It is also present at relatively high concentration at the cell junctions of all continuous endothelium, both in vivo and in cell culture (for a recent review on the biology of PECAM-1, see Ref.1Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Because of its presence on these vascular cells, PECAM-1 has been implicated in mediating a number of cellular interactions, most notably those that take place between leukocytes and the vessel wall during the process of transendothelial migration (2Bogen S.A.

In support of this hypothesis, PECAM-1-containing proteoliposomes were recently shown to be able to self-associate in a concentration-dependent, divalent cation-independent, manner (14Sun Q.-H.

Ali J. Greene T. Muller W.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).A number of experimental observations have suggested that PECAM-1 may also be capable of interacting heterophilically with other components of the cell surface. Albelda et al. found that L cell fibroblasts transfected with recombinant PECAM-1 acquired the ability to aggregate with one another in a calcium-dependent manner and raised the possibility that cation-dependent, PECAM-1-mediated cellular interactions might involve additional ligands, such as integrins or proteoglycans (13Albelda S.M. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Newman P.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In this regard, these authors noted that PECAM-1 contains within Ig domain 2 the amino acid sequence LKREKN, which corresponds loosely to one of several possible consensus glycosaminoglycan recognition motifs (20Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, PECAM-1-transfected L cells were found to bind as readily to nontransfected L cells as they did to each other (21Muller W.A. Berman M.E. Newman P.J. DeLisser H.M. Albelda S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1401-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the aggregation of PECAM-1-transfected L cells was shown to be inhibitable by selected glycosaminoglycans, including chondroitin 6-sulfate, heparan sulfate, and heparin, as well as by the Ig domain 2-derived synthetic peptide, LKREKN (22DeLisser H.M.

Taken together, these data have led to the widely held supposition that PECAM-1 is a heparin-binding protein.Given the potential importance of PECAM-1 in regulating the interaction of vascular cells during the processes of inflammation, thrombosis, and angiogenesis, determining the range of potential cellular targets for PECAM-1 is crucial for understanding the mechanism by which it is able to both initiate and respond to adhesive and signaling events. The purpose of the present investigation, therefore, was to specifically determine whether PECAM-1 is capable of interacting directly with glycosaminoglycans. To accomplish this aim, we have examined the adhesive properties of multiple mono- and multivalent forms of this adhesion receptor, including full-length cellular PECAM-1 derived from human platelet membranes, monomeric soluble recombinant human PECAM-1 (srhuPECAM-1), PECAM-1-containing proteoliposomes, and a bivalent recombinant huPECAM-1/IgG chimeric protein.DISCUSSIONAlthough PECAM-1 was discovered as a novel membrane glycoprotein on the surface of platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells more than 10 years ago (28van Mourik J.A.

In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these events, we and others have been investigating the adhesive properties of PECAM-1 and have found that amino-terminal Ig homology domains 1 and 2 of PECAM-1 play a key role in mediating PECAM-1/PECAM-1 homophilic interactions (14Sun Q.-H.

In addition to PECAM-1 itself, however, a number of other cell surface components, including glycosaminoglycans (13Albelda S.M. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Newman P.J. J. Cell.

Blood. 1993; 82: 2649-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated as ligands for PECAM-1. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to determine whether the extracellular domain of PECAM-1 contains one or more functional glycosaminoglycan-binding sites and whether cell surface glycosaminoglycans can serve as a biologically relevant target for PECAM-1-mediated cellular interactions.To accomplish these aims, we examined the glycosaminoglycan binding properties of multiple mono- and multivalent forms of PECAM-1. Our results may be summarized as follows. First, the interaction with cells of an appropriately constructed bivalent PECAM-1/IgG chimeric protein is strictly dependent on cell surface expression of PECAM-1 (Fig. 1), and exogenously added glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulfate have no effect on the ability of PECAM-1/IgG or PECAM-1 proteoliposomes to interact with the cell surface (Fig. 2 A). Second, even in cells rich in cell surface glycosaminoglycans and integrins, PECAM-1 appears to be the only functional cellular target for PECAM-1, since the interaction of PECAM-1/IgG with the endothelial cell surface could be completely inhibited by preincubating the cells with small Fab fragments specific for PECAM-1 Ig homology domain 1 (Fig. 2 B). Third, independent of either the source of PECAM-1 or the way in which heparin is presented, the extracellular domain of PECAM-1 is unable to interact directly with this glycosaminoglycan (Figs. 3 and 4, and Table I). Finally, we found that amino acid sequences contributed by certain Ig fusion vectors can, in some instances, result in the creation of artifactual heparin-binding sites that are normally not present in the native molecule (Fig. 5).Several other groups have examined the association of heparin with various cellular and chimeric forms of PECAM-1 and arrived at somewhat different conclusions from those drawn in the present work. Wattet al. (46Watt S.M. Williamson J. Genevier H. Fawcett J. Simmons D.L. Harzfield A. Nesbitt S.A. Coombe D.R. Blood. 1993; 82: 2649-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) examined the retention on heparin-Sepharose beads of full-length PECAM-1 derived from detergent cell lysates and found that approximately 20% of the PECAM-1 remained bound to the beads after washing with normal saline. However, even the small proportion of PECAM-1 that remained bound to the heparin-Sepharose beads was found to be easily dissociable. Based upon their observations, they concluded that PECAM-1 exhibited weak, but measurable, low affinity interactions with heparin. To more specifically localize the site on full-length PECAM-1 responsible for this weak association, we compared the heparin binding properties of srhuPECAM-1, a recombinant protein containing only amino acid residues 1–574 (i.e. the entire extracellular domain of PECAM-1 containing Ig-homology domains 1–6), with that of full-length PECAM-1 derived from human platelet membranes. In physiological saline, srhuPECAM-1 exhibited no affinity for heparin immobilized on Sepharose beads (Fig. 3), for heparin in solution (Fig. 4), or for heparin conjugated to BSA (Table I). However, similar to Watt et al., we did observe a weak interaction of heparin withfull-length PECAM-1 purified from cellular detergent lysates (Table I). These data suggest that the heparin-binding site on PECAM-1 lies not within the extracellular domain but rather within either the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domain of the molecule. In this regard, it is notable that there are a series of positively charged, basic amino acids immediately following the transmembrane domain of PECAM-1, having the sequence RKAKAK (residues 599–604), that confer weak heparin binding properties to the protein independent of those that might be present within the extracellular domain. In light of these findings, we suspect that the ability of full-length cell-derived PECAM-1 to bind to heparin-Sepharose (Ref. 46Watt S.M. Williamson J. Genevier H. Fawcett J. Simmons D.L. Harzfield A. Nesbitt S.A. Coombe D.R. Blood. 1993; 82: 2649-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Table I) is probably due to the association of cytoplasmic domain residues 599–604 with heparin. This interaction is likely to be of little or no functional consequence in PECAM-1-mediated cellular interactions, since heparin-binding sequences not present in the extracellular domain of the molecule would obviously be unavailable to mediate heterophilic interactions between cells.An important aspect of the present work is the finding that short amino acid sequences encoded by certain PECAM-1/IgG cDNA constructs, but not by others, can confer artifactual heparin binding properties to the chimeric protein. Margalit et al. (47Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown, using three-dimensional computer graphic techniques, that heparin binding sites within proteins are dependent upon electrostatic interactions that result from topologically close basic amino acid residues. Thus, PECAM-1/IgGRR, but not PECAM-1/IgG, contains the sequence KKAAARR within its hinge region (Fig. 5 A), and this motif is by itself able to contribute significantly to the glycosaminoglycan-binding ability of proteins and polypeptides that contain it (Figs. 5, B andC). In fact, PECAM-1/IgGRR binds a variety of PECAM-1-positive and PECAM-1-negative cell lines in a heparin-inhibitable manner. 2Q-H. Sun and P. J. Newman, unpublished observations. By themselves, these observations would have led us to believe that PECAM-1 is a heparin-binding protein and that cell surface glycosaminoglycans represent a functional target for PECAM-1 on the cell surface. However, our discovery that simple deletion of theKKAAARR motif totally eliminates the ability of PECAM-1/IgG to bind to PECAM-1-negative cells argues strongly against this possibility. Thus, we speculate that the 6–30% observed binding to heparin of the particular PECAM-1/IgG construct used by Wattet al. (Fig. 8 of Ref. 46Watt S.M. Williamson J. Genevier H. Fawcett J. Simmons D.L. Harzfield A. Nesbitt S.A. Coombe D.R. Blood. 1993; 82: 2649-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may similarly be attributable, at least in part, to sequence motifs unknowingly introduced into the hinge region of their chimeric protein that are normally notpresent within in the extracellular domain of cellular PECAM-1. The presence of similar artificially juxtaposed amino acid residues might also explain the findings of Prager et al. (48Prager E. Sunder-Plassmann R. Hansmann C. Koch C. Holter W. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), who observed heparin-inhibitable binding to T cells of their form of PECAM-1/IgG.The artifactual binding of PECAM-1/IgGRR to cells, independent of their expression of the natural ligand for PECAM-1, may not be limited to PECAM-1-based immunoadhesins. There appears, in the immunoadhesin literature in general, to have been little consideration given to the possibility that the adhesive properties of IgG fusion proteins may be affected by a combination of sequence motifs, some of which are not normally present in the native molecule. For example, in addition to sequences that may be unknowingly introduced into the hinge regions of chimeric proteins, many immunoadhesin cDNA expression vectors encode a polyhistidine tag at the carboxyl terminus to simplify recovery and purification. Unfortunately, clusters of positively charged histidine residues are also able to contribute to the overall affinity of proteins for cell surface glycosaminoglycans (49Matsumoto R. Sali A. Ghildyal N. Karplus M. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19524-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, while hinge region sequences or polyhistidine tags by themselves may be unable to confer high affinity heparin binding characteristics, when expressed together with low affinity sites present within the native protein, they may be able to significantly alter the overall cell binding properties of the chimeric protein.Previous results from our laboratory and others have led to the hypothesis that the six-amino acid sequence, LKREKN, located at amino acid residues 150–155 within extracellular Ig domain 2, might function as a heparin binding site (13Albelda S.M. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Newman P.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was based 1) on the similarity of this sequence with a known glycosaminoglycan binding motif having the sequenceX −3-B−2-B−1-X +1-B+2-X +3, where B is a basic amino acid and X is hydropathic residue (20Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) on the ability of both heparin and the LKREKN peptide to inhibit the in vitro association of PECAM-1-transfected L cells with nontransfected L cells (22DeLisser H.M. Yan H.-C.Y. Newman P.J. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16037-16046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are, however, a number of theoretical problems and recent observations that cast doubt on the ability of LKREKN to serve as a functional heparin binding domain. First, the reverse peptide, NKERKL, which does not contain theXBBXBX motif, was found to be equally inhibitory in the L cell aggregation assay, and neither the forward nor the reverse peptide exhibited significant inhibitory effects except at a relatively high concentration (>0.5 mm) (22DeLisser H.M. Yan H.-C.Y. Newman P.J. Muller W.A. Buck C.A. Albelda S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16037-16046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, as shown in Table II, it has only recently become appreciated that neither the LKREKN sequence nor theXBBXBX motif are particularly well conserved evolutionarily in PECAM-1; in rat PECAM-1, the −2-position is occupied by a serine rather than the obligatory Lys or Arg residue, and the basic residue normally found at −1 is occupied in murine PECAM-1 by an isoleucine. In fact, a perfectly conserved glutamic acid residue occupies the normally hydropathic +1-position in all PECAM-1 species examined to date, and negatively charged residues are specifically excluded from functional glycosaminoglycan-binding motifs because they have the potential to significantly alter the charge complementation of this region necessary to effect its interaction with negatively charged heparin (20Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, Piali et al. (50Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) have recently found that the adhesion of murine lymphokine-activated killer cells to an immobilized chimeric protein composed of murine PECAM-1 Ig domains 1–3 fused to the mouse Igκ constant region could be inhibited by anti-PECAM-1 antibodies but wasnot inhibitable by heparin at concentrations as high as 300 μg/ml (50Piali L. Hammel P. Uherek C. Bachmann F. Gisler R.H. Dunon D. Imhof B.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1995; 130: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Fourth, neither heparin (100 μg/ml) nor the LKREKN peptide (1 mg/ml) had any effect on the adhesion of U937 cells to immobilized full-length PECAM-1/IgG (51Buckley C.D. Doyonnas R. Newton J.P. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Watt S.M. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 437-445PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, neither leukocyte transendothelial migration nor endothelial cell tube formation, each of which are thought to involve PECAM-1, are inhibited by heparin (10Matsumura T. Wolff K. Petzelbauer P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3408-3416PubMed Google Scholar,17Liao F. Huynh H.K. Eiroa A. Greene T. Polizzi E. Muller W.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that heparin has no affinity for synthetic peptides containing the LKREKN sequence,2 these data suggest that the mechanism by which heparin is able to inhibit the interaction of PECAM-1-transfected L cells would appear to be independent of the direct glycosaminoglycan binding properties of PECAM-1 itself and probably operates by inhibiting secondary adhesive interactions that occur downstream of PECAM-1 (1Newman P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Identification of the range of cellular and molecular events that emanate from PECAM-1 engagement remains an impo"

Their identities have been confirmed by heterologous expression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (6Stadler R. Wolf K. Hilgarth C. Tanner W. Sauer N.

A. 1990; 87: 7949-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the HUP1 transporter retains its uptake activity after solubilization from the membrane of transgenic fission yeast, purification to homogeneity, and reconstitution into proteoliposomes (8Opekarová M.

Plant J. 1996; 10: 1045-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The HUP symporters belong to a large family of substrate transporters, called the “major facilitator superfamily” (10Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Members of this major facilitator superfamily are thought to consist of 12 α-helical transmembrane segments connected by internal and external loops. Support for this topological model comes from alkaline phosphatase fusion protein analysis of the Escherichia coli lactose permease lacY (11Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and N-glycosylation scanning mutagenesis studies on the human glucose facilitator GLUT1 (12Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, hard structural data on the nature of the binding sites and translocation pathways of substrates and cosubstrates have not been obtained. Since no three-dimensional structure of a transporter is in sight, one has to be content with indirect evidence, deduced for example from mutagenesis studies. Structure-function analysis of the HUP1 transporter (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Will A. Caspari T.

Microbiol. 1994; 140: 2617-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several mutants with an increased K m value ford-glucose uptake were found by site-directed mutagenesis (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by polymerase chain reaction random mutagenesis with subsequent selection for decreased sensitivity toward the toxic sugar 2-deoxyglucose (14Will A. Caspari T. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10163-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The affected amino acids cluster in the middle of the transmembrane helices V (Gln-179), VII (Gln-298 and Gln-299), and XI (Val-433 and Asn-436), with the exception of Asp-44 putatively located at the beginning of the first external loop (Fig. 1). The fact that predominantly acidic amino acids and their amides were identified correlates well with the finding that binding sites of periplasmic sugar-binding proteins are built up by such residues (16Quiocho F.A. Vyas N.K. Nature. 1984; 310: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Vyas N.K. Vyas M.N. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The symporters HUP1 and HUP2 differ significantly in their substrate specificity (6Stadler R. Wolf K. Hilgarth C. Tanner W. Sauer N. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Will A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Especially, the affinity ford-galactose is more than 100 times higher for the HUP2 protein. The amino acids of the HUP1 protein probably involved in substrate recognition (see above) are also present in the HUP2 transporter. The different substrate specificities of the two transporters must, therefore, be determined by differing residues at still unidentified positions. Recently, a study using chimeric proteins revealed that the exchange of a 30-amino acid span at the beginning of the first extracellular loop of HUP1 for that of HUP2 increases the affinity for d-galactose by about 15-fold (18Will A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present work tries to find answers to the following questions. 1) Do additional residues exist in the HUP1 symporter, which give rise to an increased K m value for d-glucose uptake upon replacement? 2) Do all these HUP1 mutants also exhibit decreased affinities for other sugars, or do some of them show substrate specific effects? 3) Is it possible to narrow down the segment of the first external loop of HUP2 participating ind-galactose recognition?

A. 1994; 91: 10163-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in order to achieve one error per cDNA fragment on average. The pool of randomly mutagenized cDNAs was ligated into pEVP11 or pART3 and introduced in S. pombe cells leading to the RMY and RGY transformants, respectively. Plasmid reisolation from RGY52 was performed by the phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol procedure (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. 2nd Ed.

The aqueous phase containing the recovered plasmids was purified and precipitated by successive treatment with phenol, diethyl ether, and ethanol prior to transformation of E. coliDH5α. However, this procedure for plasmid isolation from yeast cells as well as several others failed in the cases of RMY126 and RMY254. Therefore one big colony of each of these transformants was picked and directly applied to a standard polymerase chain reaction. Plasmids were released from the cells due to preincubation at 94 °C for 10 min. The mutated HUP1 cDNAs were amplified afterward using flanking primers that bind in the promotor and the polylinker region of pEVP11. Then they were subcloned via SacI/BamHI into pUC18 and their nucleotide changes were determined by sequence analysis using the T7SequencingTM kit (Pharmacia Biotech) and synthetic oligonucleotides. The transformants RMY126 and RGY52 both exhibited two point mutations in the HUP1 gene (see “Results”). These mutations could be separated using a unique KpnI restriction site lying in between (Fig. 1). The SacI/KpnI fragment and the KpnI/BamHI fragment coding for the N- and C-terminal part were ligated to the respective missing sequences from the wild-type clone. This resulted in HUP1coding regions carrying either the one or the other mutation. Those originating from RMY126 were resubcloned into pEVP11, those originating from RGY52 into pART3. S. pombe YGS-B25 was transformed as described above. Preparation of the single-stranded HUP1 and HUP2 template DNA was performed as described previously (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Will A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis was carried out with the SculptorTM in vitromutagenesis system (Amersham) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides used were as follows (changed bases are underlined): (a) K59Q/K60M, 5′-CTGGGAAGAACATCTGCTCAAAGGCCTC-3′; (b) R144L, 5′-ACCAAGCAGCACGAGGCCGACAATCAGCA-3′; (c) R204L, 5′-GACCCAGGGACAGAAGCCACCCGTTCTCC-3′; (d) N45I, 5′-CCAGTCACACCGATATCATAGCC-3′; (e) V52T, 5′-CCTCCAGGGAGGTGACGCCACCAG-3′; (f) I47N, 5′-CCAGTCACACCGTTGTCATAGCCG-3′. Sequencing the whole length of the cDNA verified the desired mutation(s) and excluded the possibility of additional changes. Correct clones were subcloned into pART3 (a–c) or pEVP11 (d–f). We previously reported (18Will A. Tanner W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) the construction of a chimeric HUP1/2/1 transporter (C6), which consists mainly of HUP1 sequence. Only the front part of the first extracellular loop is derived from the HUP2 symporter. The HUP1 fragment coding for this loop section was excised by EcoRV/BsgI digestion (see Fig. 1) and replaced with the equivalent HUP2 fragment. TheEcoRV restriction site had first to be introduced into the cDNAs of the wild-type transporters without changing the amino acid sequences. Approximately in the middle of the exchanged loop segment exists a unique Asp700I restriction site (Fig. 1) at homologous positions in HUP1 and HUP2. Substitution of the Asp700I/BsgI fragment ofHUP1 for that of HUP2 resulted in the chimeric cDNA C7. C8 was generated in the same way by replacement of theEcoRV/Asp700I fragment. All chimericHUP1/2/1 cDNAs possess exactly the same 5′-untranslated sequence as the wild-type HUP1 and were cloned viaSacI/BamHI into the expression vector pEVP11. Five to 20 ml of S. pombe cells (OD578 = 1.0) were harvested, washed once in 5 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and resuspended in the same buffer to a final volume of 1 ml. Cells were optimally energized by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 120 mm. After 2 min of shaking at 30 °C the test was started by adding radioactive sugar. Samples were withdrawn at given intervals, filtered through nitrocellulose filters (0.8 μm pore size), and washed once with distilled water. Incorporation of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. In order to obtain theK m and V max values, initial uptake rates were measured at different substrate concentrations and plotted according to Lineweaver-Burk. Since nontransformed S. pombe cells (YGS-B25) do not show measurable hexose uptake activity, transport rates of mutated HUP gene products as low as 0.1% of that of wild-type HUPs expressed in S. pombe could reliably be measured. When the effect of external pH was tested, cells were washed and resuspended in McIlvaine buffer (adjusted to a given pH in the range from pH 3 to 7 by mixing 100 mm citric acid with 200 mm Na2HPO4) or 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (adjusted to a given pH in the range from pH 7 to 9). All radioactive sugars wered-[U-14C]compounds purchased from Amersham. S. pombe cells of a 30-ml culture (OD578 ≈ 1) were pelleted by centrifugation. Their membranes were isolated as described (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein content was assayed by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar); proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose and incubated overnight with polyclonal anti-HUP1-A antibody (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was immunodetected with the ECL kit of Amersham. Expression of mutant cDNAs was compared with that of wild-type HUP1 cloned in the same vector (pEVP11 or pART3). The K m value is an expression independent measure of the affinity of the HUP1 transporter for its sugar sustrate(s). Therefore K m mutants should lead to the identification of amino acid residues most probably involved in substrate binding. Recently we reported an unbiased functional screening for such K m mutants (14Will A. Caspari T. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10163-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is based on a 1000-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose sensitivity upon transformation of a sugar uptake deficient S. pombestrain with the HUP1 cDNA. A pool of randomly mutatedHUP1 cDNAs was generated by polymerase chain reaction and used for transformation. Transformants with intermediate 2-deoxy-d-glucose sensitivity were selected and tested for decreased affinity for d-glucose. FourK m mutants had been obtained in this way (14Will A. Caspari T. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10163-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the meantime further use of this strategy has been made and three additional mutants have been isolated (TableI).Table Id-Glucose transport characteristics of three additional S. pombe strains transformed with randomly mutated Chlorella HUP1 cDNAsS. pombe strainNucleotide exchangeAmino acid exchangeLocationK mV maxTransport proteinM%wt-HUP11.5 × 10−5100100RMY254TAC→TATY81YLoop 16 × 10−42≤1AGG→CGGR197RLoop 5AAC→ATCN436IHelix XIRMY126GGT→TGTG97CHelix II4 × 10−375ATC→AACI303NHelix VIIRGY52GGT→GATG120DHelix III7 × 10−423TTT→TTAF292LHelix VII Open table in a new tab The HUP1 cDNA isolated from RMY254 exhibits three nucleotide changes, but only one of them affects the primary structure of the HUP1 protein. The substitution of the asparagine residue at position 436 in helix XI for isoleucine decreases the affinity ford-glucose 40-fold. The cDNAs of the otherK m mutants carry only two point mutations, which both result in amino acid changes. Thus, the HUP1 symporter of RMY126 contains cysteine and asparagine instead of glycine 97 (helix II) and isoleucine 303 (helix VII), respectively. The K m value for d-glucose is dramatically increased by a factor of about 270. The point mutations in the HUP1 cDNA of RGY52 alter the transport protein in the following way. Glycine 120 (helix III) is replaced by an aspartic acid and phenylalanine 292 (helix VII) is changed to leucine. As a consequence theK m value for d-glucose rises approximately 50-fold as compared with that of the wild-type. These K m mutants also show a dramatic decrease inV max value, which correlates well, however, with the poor level of expression (Table I). A reduced amount of transport protein is not unusual for clones originating from the random mutagenesis approach, since a lower uptake rate also contributes to higher 2-deoxy-d-glucose resistance (14Will A. Caspari T. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10163-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is not really understood, however, why these mutations lead to such a low expression of transport protein. The possibility that mutations affect protein secondary structure and/or protein stability, leading to indirect effects on K m values, unfortunately cannot be ruled out. Although, in principle this is true for all mutations described here or elsewhere, particular caution is required for those reducing the expression level. In order to elucidate whether the K m change found in RMY126 and RGY52 is brought about by both substitutions acting additively or whether it is simply caused by one of them, the mutations were separated from each other as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Table II lists theK m values of the single mutants. Obviously, the effect of substituting Gly-97 for Cys on the d-glucose affinity of HUP1 is negligible. The nearly identicalK m values of mutant and wild-type transporter manifest that glycine 97 is not important for the interaction with the substrate. On the other hand mutant I303N exhibits aK m value very similar to that of the double mutant RMY126. Therefore, it is suggested that the isoleucine residue in helix VII is involved in d-glucose binding.Table IId-Glucose transport characteristics of S. pombe strains expressing HUP1 transporter with the single mutations G97C, I303N, G120D, or F292LMutantK mV maxTransport proteinM%wt-HUP11.5 × 10−5100100G97C5 × 10−53≤5I303N6 × 10−3120NDaND, not determined.G120D3 × 10−4915F292L7 × 10−41315a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab In the case of RGY52 the results are more complex. Both substitutions in question generate effects on d-glucose affinity, but they are not additive. The replacement F292L causes a 50-fold increase of the K m value equal to that of the double mutant. In the G120D mutant the K m value is raised somewhat less but still significantly (about 30-fold). It is not clear why the effects are not additive to some extent. It seems that the structural aberration caused by F292L includes the one induced by G120D. Since G120D is a much more drastic change when compared with F292L, the results are taken as indication that the phenylalanine residue in helix VII is important for correct substrate binding. Finally, it should be emphasized that for all single mutants the V maxvalue correlates very well with the amount of transport protein detected by immunoblotting (Table II). The Chlorella HUP1 symporter enables transformed S. pombe cells to take up a great number of monosaccharides. The affinities for the particular sugar substrates differ widely, however. Thus, the K m values for the uptake of d-glucose, d-mannose,d-fructose, d-xylose, andd-galactose turned out to be in the range of 1.5 × 10−5, 1.5 × 10−4, 3 × 10−4, 1.5 × 10−3, and 3 × 10−3m, respectively (TableIII). In previous publications (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Will A. Caspari T. Tanner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10163-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as well as in this paper, several HUP1 mutants with an increasedK m value for d-glucose were described. It was of interest to find out whether these mutants show less efficient binding also of other substrates, i.e. whether sugar specific effects or more general ones are produced by the mutations. For this purpose the mutated HUP1 transporters listed in Table III were chosen for a detailed analysis of their substrate specificities and compared with that of the wild-type protein.Table IIISubstrate specificity of S. pombe strains expressing various mutated HUP1 transportersMutantd-Glucosed-Mannosed-Fructosed-Xylosed-Galactosewt-HUP11.5 × 10−51.5 × 10−43 × 10−41.5 × 10−33 × 10−3D44E2 × 10−42.5 × 10−46 × 10−42 × 10−32 × 10−3Q179EaThis mutant is actually a double mutant, but the second exchange, F497S, is in all probability unimportant, since it is located in the C-terminal tail, that can be deleted without affecting substrate binding (14).1.5 × 10−47.5 × 10−33.5 × 10−3n.d.n.d.Q298N1.5 × 10−43 × 10−47.5 × 10−4≥2 × 10−2≥5 × 10−2I303N6 × 10−32.5 × 10−21.5 × 10−2n.d.n.d.N436Y≥5 × 10−2≥5 × 10−2≥5 × 10−2n.d.n.d.N436Q3.5 × 10−45.5 × 10−44 × 10−4≥5 × 10−2≥5 × 10−2b N.D., not determined.a This mutant is actually a double mutant, but the second exchange, F497S, is in all probability unimportant, since it is located in the C-terminal tail, that can be deleted without affecting substrate binding (14Will A.

Three mutations, Q179E, I303N, and N436Y, equally diminish the affinities for all sugars tested (d-glucose,d-mannose, and d-fructose). In the case of Q298N and N436Q the K m values ford-glucose, d-xylose, andd-galactose transport are significantly increased while those for d-mannose and d-fructose uptake are only mildly affected. The conservative exchange D44E, however, influences the substrate specificity in an extraordinary way. As previously pointed out, this substitution increases theK m for d-glucose uptake by more than 10 times (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, none of the K m values for other sugar substrates is altered in the D44E mutant significantly,i.e. by more than a factor of 2. These results suggest a special role of aspartate 44 in the glucose transport process. Therefore, this amino acid position has been investigated more thoroughly. In the transporter model of Fig. 1 aspartate 44 is situated at the very beginning of the first extracellular loop of HUP1. This is based on the simple energetic reason that charged amino acids are expected to avoid the lipophilic environment of the membrane. In the lactose permease of E. coli, however, two aspartate residues are thought to exist in transmembrane helix VII. They both are neutralized by forming salt bridges with lysine residues in helix X and XI, respectively (24Sahin-Tóth M. Dunten R. Gonzalez A. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10547-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is a characteristic feature of these charge pairs that simultaneous replacement of both partners by neutral amino acids does not impair the translocation process, whereas the exchange of only one partner, leaving the other one unpaired, inactivates the permease completely. Since the mutation D44N leads to a total inactivation of the HUP1 transporter (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it might be suspected that the aspartic acid residue likewise is involved in a salt bridge. The primary structure of the Chlorella transporter provides several basic amino acids that might act as the positively charged counterpart. Some of them were replaced individually or in combination by neutral residues (TableIV). The ability to take upd-glucose is maintained in the mutants R144L, R204L, and K59Q/K60M, albeit with dramatically reduced overall activities. These reductions, however, primarily reflect the low expression levels. There is no indication that the catalytic activity per se is impaired. Moreover d-glucose transport tests of all three mutants yield K m values nearly identical to that of wild-type HUP1. These results make it unlikely that one of the basic amino acids at position 59, 60, 144, or 204 in the transport protein interacts with aspartate 44 via a salt bridge.Table IVd-Glucose transport characteristics of S. pombe strains expressing HUP1 transporter with the site specific mutations K59Q/K60M, R144L, or R204LMutantK mV maxTransport proteinM%wt-HUP11.5 × 10−5100100K59Q/K60M2.5 × 10−5410R144L1.5 × 10−5<1<1R204L1.5 × 10−5210D44NNo measurable activity80 Open table in a new tab Previous studies not only demonstrated the absolute necessity of a carboxyl group at position 44 but also the importance of its precise location for the transporter to be active. Thus, increasing the side chain length by changing aspartic into glutamic acid (D44E) decreases the V max of d-glucose uptake by 90% and raises the K m by 15-fold as compared with the wild-type, although similar amounts of transport protein are present in the cells (13Caspari T. Stadler R. Sauer N. Tanner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3498-3502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to elucidate whether the potential for protonation/deprotonation of Glu-44 as compared with that of Asp-44 is affected, the influence of extracellular pH on the translocation reaction catalyzed by the two symporters has been examined. Thed-glucose uptake activity of HUP1 is optimal at about pH 4.5 and declines steeply toward lower and higher values (Fig.2). The D44E mutant shows a completely different pH dependence. As ambient pH is increased from 3.0 to 9.0,d-glucose uptake is accelerated gradually, reaching an optimum at about pH 7.0. Despite the high homology (74%), the Chlorellasymporters HUP1 and HUP2 differ significantly in substrate specificity (6Stadler R. Wolf K. Hilgar"
https://openalex.org/W2122748202,"Studies on the mechanisms of inducible and constitutive activity of NF-κB transcription factors have been hampered by the lack of appropriate mutant cell lines. We have analyzed the defect in the murine S107 plasmacytoma cell line, which was previously found to lack both constitutive and inducible NF-κB activity. Our analysis shows that these cells bear a specific defect that interferes with NF-κB induction by many diverse stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, UV light, x-rays, and H2O2. This does not however represent a general signal transduction defect, because AP-1 transcription factors are readily induced by the same stimuli. Phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid as well as calyculin A can efficiently induce NF-κB in S107 cells via a pathway apparently insensitive to the radical scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. Furthermore, MEKK1 a protein kinase supposedly induced by some of the above stimuli, is also capable of activating NF-κB. Interestingly, both the potent physiological inducer of NF-κB TNFα as well as endoplasmic reticulum overload can induce NF-κB via a PDTC sensitive pathway. In all cases, DNA-binding NF-κB complexes are comprised predominantly of p50-RelA heterodimers, and NF-κB activation results in the induction of transiently transfected or resident reporter genes. In summary, these results suggest that the pathways for many NF-κB-inducing stimuli converge at a specific junction, and this pivotal step is mutated in the S107 cell line. Yet there are alternative routes bypassing this critical step that also lead to NF-κB induction.

The NF-κB/Rel transcription factors consist of five mammalian family members that bind to DNA as homo- and/or heterodimers (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 3Siebenlist U.

The NF-Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 153-188Google Scholar). Two of the family members, NFKB1 and NFKB2, are synthesized as precursor proteins (p105 and p100, respectively), which are proteolytically processed to obtain the mature proteins p50 and p52. The other three members, RelA, RelB, and c-Rel, are produced directly without such a processing step. These latter family members contain efficient transactivation domains in their COOH-terminal domains (RelA and c-Rel) or both NH2- and COOH-terminal domains (RelB), and therefore they are largely responsible for the transactivation capacity of homo- and heterodimers containing these subunits. NF-κB was originally identified as a transcription factor constitutively present in the nuclei of mature B and plasma cells, yet present in a latent but inducible form in pre-B cells as well as most other cell types (5Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar, 6Sen R. Baltimore D.

The mechanism leading to this inducibility was resolved to some extent. In most cell types, NF-κB family members are localized in the cytoplasm due to the interaction with inhibitory proteins, the IκBs (8Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). These IκB proteins first of all inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins by masking the nuclear localization signal and also directly block their DNA binding. The IκB proteins again represent a protein family consisting of at least six family members described so far. IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, and Bcl3 represent independent genes, whereas IκBγ and IκBδ are derived from the COOH-terminal domains of the NFKB1 and NFKB2 precursor proteins, respectively (2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 4Schreck R. Kistler B. Wirth T. Papavassiliou A.G. The NF-Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes. R. G.

Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different inhibitor proteins show some selectivity toward different NF-κB dimeric complexes. IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε are involved in regulation of the inducible activity of the NF-κB complexes. A variety of external or internal stimuli lead to the initiation of a signal transduction cascade, which culminates in the activation of IκB kinase(s). Two such IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; ALLN, N- acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal. have been cloned recently, but the details of the activation of these kinase are not known yet (11DiDonato J.A.

The degradation of IκB proteins leads to the release of NF-κB complexes, which can migrate to the nucleus, bind to DNA, and regulate transcription. Target genes regulated by NF-κB play important roles in immune, inflammatory or stress responses, cell adhesion, and protection against apoptosis (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell.

Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 153-188Google Scholar). Within the B cell lineage, pro-B cells and pre-B cells contain NF-κB in an inhibited form just like most other cell types, but later stages of B cell development contain constitutive nuclear NF-κB (1Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 153-188Google Scholar). This activation of NF-κB as a consequence of B cell development is also observed in a primary B cell differentiation system (25Kistler B. Rolink A. Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Wirth T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2308-2317PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms leading to the constitutive activation of NF-κB complexes in mature B cells and plasma cells remain largely unresolved. Several observations have been made over the past years, which addressed this constitutive activity. It was demonstrated that the half-life of the IκBα protein is significantly decreased in mature B and plasma cells as compared with pre-B cells, but at the same time there is an increased rate of de novo synthesis (26Miyamoto S. Chiao P.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3276-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Liou H.C. Sha W.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it could be shown that some heterodimer complexes are less efficiently targeted by IκBα as compared with others (28Dobrzanski P. Ryseck R.-P. Bravo R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4608-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and in addition, at least the p50-RelB complexes in mature B cells appear to be modified in a way that makes them escape IκB inhibition (29Lernbecher T. Müller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 30Lernbecher T. Kistler B. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4060-4069Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A specific role for IκBβ has also been suggested recently (25Kistler B. Rolink A. Marienfeld R. Neumann M. Wirth T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2308-2317PubMed Google Scholar, 31Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the process of B cell differentiation hypophosphorylated IκBβ, which can still interact with NF-κB but does not mask the nuclear localization signal and fails to inhibit DNA binding, could shield NF-κB from inhibition by IκBα (31Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Phillips R.J. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The constitutive activation of NF-κB in B cells may have some components in common with the inducible branch of NF-κB activation. However, a detailed analysis of these two mechanisms was hampered by the lack of appropriate mutant cell lines, which would allow a thorough analysis. The murine plasmacytoma cell line, S107, was described several years ago as a cell line lacking constitutive nuclear NF-κB (33Atchison M.L. Perry R.P. Cell. 1987; 48: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this cell line, κB-dependent transcription of reporter genes is completely absent; the endogenous Igκ gene shows normal expression, however. This is most likely due to the activity of the 3′ κ-enhancer element (34Meyer K.B. Neuberger M.S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Early somatic cell fusion studies of S107 cells with pre-B cell lines had already suggested that most components of the machinery leading to constitutive nuclear NF-κB were still intact in this cell line, because the defect could be restored in the fusion hybrids (35Atchison M.L. Perry R.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4213-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Analysis of the expression levels of NF-κB and IκB family members had revealed that most of the subunits of these families are in fact expressed in S107 cells (36Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p50-RelA complexes were found in the cytoplasm of these cells associated with IκB molecules and treatment of cytoplasmic extracts with the detergent deoxycholate released DNA-binding NF-κB complexes. However, these complexes could not be mobilized by LPS or PMA treatment of the intact cells, suggesting some defect in the inducible signal transduction pathway. Interestingly, S107 cells lack expression of the relB gene and upon stable transfection of these cells with a RelB expression vector but not a RelA expression vector resulted in the appearance of nuclear p50-RelB complexes and restored the κB-dependent transcriptional activity. In addition, whereas the parental S107 cells showed a striking defect in B cell-specific demethylation of a transfected methylated Igκ locus, the RelB transfectants had also regained the demethylation capacity (36Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 37Kistler B. Baumann B. Bergman Y. Wirth T. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here we have analyzed the defect of the S107 cell line in much more detail. We provide evidence that S107 cells are specifically defective in responding to a subset of NF-κB-inducing stimuli. Because other inducers still work in these cells this suggests the existence of at least two distinct signal transduction pathways, which both lead to NF-κB induction. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. For transient transfections, 3 μg of the luciferase reporter and 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus LacZ were used. Cells were transfected by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser at 960 microfarad and 220 V. For cotransfection experiments, 10 μg of the MEKK1 expression vector, the influenza hemagglutinin expression vector, or the parental empty expression vectors were included. The Rous sarcoma virus-driven eucaryotic expression vector for the hemagglutinin gene of the human influenza strain A/Mongolia/231/85 was kindly provided by Dr. S. Ludwig. 16 h after transfection cells were treated as indicated, and cells were harvested 6–8 h later. Luciferase enzyme activity was determined, and β-galactosidase levels were used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. For generation of stable transfectants of the S107 cell line, cells were electroporated with 20 μg of the 3xκB-reporter plasmid together with 1 μg of a pSV.puro vector. Stably transfected cell clones were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin. Whole cell extracts were prepared by the freeze-thaw method described previously (29Lernbecher T. Müller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Conditions for EMSA and EMSA antibody supershifts have also been described before. In all cases, a radiolabeled probe containing the Ig-κ enhancer consensus NF-κB site was used. Quality of the extracts was verified by parallel EMSA experiments with an octamer probe detecting the Oct-1 (and Oct-2) transcription factors. For Western immunoblots, 50–100 μg of protein extract were separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, proteins were detected with the indicated antibodies, and blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies used for supershift and Western immunoblot assays were purchased from Santa Cruz, except for the IκBε antibodies, which were a kind gift from Dr. Nancy Rice. The S107 cell line, in contrast to virtually all other known plasmacytoma cell lines, lacks constitutive nuclear NF-κB proteins and is also defective in induction on NF-κB after treatment with a variety of stimuli (33Atchison M.L. Perry R.P. Cell. 1987; 48: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 35Atchison M.L. Perry R.P. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4213-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37Kistler B. Baumann B. Bergman Y. Wirth T. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We wanted to assess whether these cells harbor a pleiotropic signal transduction defect or are specifically defective in signals mediating NF-κB activation. Therefore, we analyzed a variety of different stimuli for their ability to activate NF-κB and, as a control, the AP-1 transcription factors. Untreated S107 cells lack DNA-binding NF-κB proteins, and stimulation with different agents such as LPS, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), phorbol ester together with a calcium ionophore (PMA and ionomycin), x-ray, and UV irradiation all fail to induce NF-κB in S107 cells (Fig.1 A). In contrast, when these same stimulating conditions were analyzed with the pre-B cell line PD31, which also lacks constitutive NF-κB activity, all treatments resulted in the induction of NF-κB complexes. However, the same stimuli readily activated AP-1 transcription factors in both PD31 as well as S107 cells (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). Therefore, the signaling defect in S107 cells appears to be specific for the NF-κB pathway. To exclude the possibility that the response to these various stimuli was just delayed in S107 cells, we analyzed several inducers over an extended time course. Importantly, even continuous treatment with NF-κB-inducing stimuli such as LPS, PMA, and H2O2 for up to 24 h did not result in a measurable induction in S107 cells, whereas PD31 cells showed a rapid and persistent NF-κB activation (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). A mutant pre-B cell line that also failed to activate NF-κB in response to a variety of stimuli was described recently (38Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The defect in these cells could be overcome by treating them with phosphatase inhibitors such as okadaic acid and calyculin A. Interestingly, this induction by phosphatase inhibitors was insensitive to treatment with the antioxidant PDTC. We therefore investigated whether these phosphatase inhibitors would lead to NF-κB induction in S107 cells and as a control in Jurkat cells. Indeed, the inhibitors were able to induce NF-κB DNA binding activity in both cell lines (Fig.2 A). Whereas at high concentrations okadaic acid inhibits both phosphatase 1 and phosphatase 2A, at low concentration okadaic acid specifically inhibits phosphatase 2A. When different concentrations of okadaic acid were tested for NF-κB induction, 5 nm okadaic acid resulted in induced NF-κB DNA binding, suggesting that phosphatase 2A is involved in the activation (data not shown). Activation of NF-κB by okadaic acid and calyculin A was rapid and could be detected after only 15 min of treatment (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). From previous results it was not absolutely clear at what stage of this signal transduction cascade okadaic acid and calyculin A would interfere. Whereas it had been reported that the activation of NF-κB by okadaic acid involves the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and could be blocked by addition of radical scavengers, such as PDTC (39Schmidt K.N. Traenckner E.B.-M. Meier B. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27136-27142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the results in the mutant pre-B cell line demonstrated that induction of NF-κB by phosphatase inhibitors can be resistant to PDTC treatment (38Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the effect of PDTC on induction of NF-κB by okadaic acid and calyculin A in S107 and Jurkat cells. Interestingly, whereas NF-κB induction was completely resistant to the addition of the radical scavenger in S107 cells (Fig. 2 B, left and right panels), NF-κB induction by okadaic acid in Jurkat cells could be completely blocked by pretreating the cells with PDTC (Fig.2 B, right panel). To analyze whether induction of NF-κB by phosphatase inhibitors would be sensitive to PDTC in other cells, we analyzed PD31 cells and found a virtual complete block by PDTC (Fig. 2 C). These results demonstrate that the same inducing stimuli may activate NF-κB in different cell types via distinct pathways. In the typical pathway of NF-κB activation, the phosphorylated IκBα protein becomes poly-ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. To test whether treatment of cells with okadaic acid does indeed result in the accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα, which is targeted for subsequent degradation, we analyzed the effect of a well known proteasome inhibitor, ALLN. Addition of ALLN to okadaic acid-treated Jurkat or S107 cells resulted in a strong reduction of induced NF-κB complexes (Fig. 2 D, right upper panel). When the status of IκBα was analyzed by protein immunoblotting, ALLN treatment resulted in the accumulation of a slower migrating form of IκBα, which represents the phosphorylated form of this protein (Fig. 2 D, lower right panel). The identical results were obtained for Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2 D,left panel). These results suggest that the downstream signaling events, starting from phosphorylation of IκBα to proteolytic degradation of this protein by the proteasome pathway, are apparently intact in the mutant S107 cell line. This localizes the defect to a common signaling intermediate utilized by all the stimuli unable to induce NF-κB. The analysis of the NF-κB induction by TNFα and interleukin-1 clearly represents the best understood pathway to date. The receptors for these ligands recruit TRAF proteins (TRAF2 and TRAF6, respectively) upon activation, and these TRAF proteins directly associate with NIK, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase shown to be critically involved in NF-κB induction in these pathways. Interestingly, when the catalytic subunits of the cytokine-inducible IκB kinase (IKKα and IKKβ) were cloned (11DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 12Régnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), a direct physical interaction between NIK and IKKα or IKKα-IKKβ heterodimers was demonstrated. Therefore, in this pathway the essential upstream components required for NF-κB activation are known. We therefore asked whether TNFα could activate NF-κB in the S107 cells. Interestingly, in contrast to the other physiological inducers of NF-κB tested before, TNFα was readily capable of inducing NF-κB even in S107 cells (Fig.3 A). Because TNFα induction of NF-κB in most cell lines is also sensitive to the radical scavenger PDTC, we analyzed whether the observed induction in S107 cells might be PDTC-sensitive. Indeed we found that pretreatment of S107 cells with this radical scavenger completely abolished induction of NF-κB, whereas PDTC by itself had virtually no effect (Fig.3 B). The observation that TNFα induces NF-κB via a PDTC-sensitive pathway, whereas okadaic acid and calyculin A induced NF-κB via a PDTC-insensitive pathway, posed the question of whether the induced NF-κB complexes observed after induction by these two stimuli were identical. To address this question, we performed antibody supershift experiments using antibodies recognizing the different members of the NF-κB/Rel-family. This analysis revealed that in both cases predominantly RelA-containing complexes were induced (Fig.3 C). We then asked whether the observed induction of NF-κB by TNFα was a direct effect or whether the induction might be indirect,e.g. TNFα might induce some secreted molecules that activate NF-κB in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. We therefore analyzed the kinetic of NF-κB induction after TNFα treatment in S107 cells and Jurkat T cells. In both cell lines, strong NF-κB induction could be detected within 15 min of TNFα treatment (Fig.4). This suggests that the activation of NF-κB is indeed a direct consequence of TNFα treatment in S107 cells and not the consequence of activation of an autocrine loop. We do note a difference between the two cell lines, however. Upon prolonged induction (more than 2 h) of Jurkat cells, the NF-κB activity is attenuated (see Fig. 4). In contrast, S107 cells show a persistent stimulation of NF-κB DNA binding. To assess whether the TNFα-induced NF-κB complexes would be transcriptionally active, we analyzed the transactivation capacity on a κB-dependent reporter (3xκB.luc). When S107 cells were transiently transfected with this reporter, activity could be induced about 40-fold by treatment of the cells with TNFα (Fig.5 A). When this reporter was stably integrated into S107 cells it showed only weak basal activity. Upon induction of S107 cells with TNFα, however, activity of the κB-dependent reporter was again induced about 40–50-fold (Fig. 5 B). Consistent with the results obtained in the EMSA experiments, treatment of the transfected S107 cells with PDTC completely abolished the induction of reporter gene activity by TNFα in both transient and stable transfections. Likewise, when cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor ALLN, TNFα failed to induce reporter gene activity. Neither PDTC nor ALLN had any effect on the reporter in the absence of TNFα treatment (Fig. 5, A andB). We had previously shown that the S107 cell line lacks expression of therelB gene, and we had suggested that this might be a consequence of the lack of induced NF-κB (36Kirillov A. Kistler B. Mostoslavsky R. Cedar H. Wirth T. Bergman Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 37Kistler B. Baumann B. Bergman Y. Wirth T. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We had furthermore suggested that RelB is a target gene of NF-κB. We therefore asked whether prolonged treatment of S107 cells with TNFα, which led to the induction of NF-κB, would result in the expression of the endogenousrelB gene. Indeed, when extracts from Jurkat and S107 cells induced with TNFα for 4 h and longer were analyzed for RelB expression by protein immunoblot, a significant induction was seen in both cell lines (Fig. 6 A). From this analysis it is furthermore evident that IκBα, another known target gene of NF-κB, is degraded early after induction with TNFα and then efficiently resynthesized. These results demonstrate that NF-κB induced by TNFα in S107 cells is capable of activating endogenous target genes. Interestingly, in S107 cells IκBα levels decreased early after TNFα induction but resumed to starting levels within 1 h, whereas induced NF-κB levels persisted for much longer times. We therefore analyzed whether degradation of other members of the IκB protei"

Part of the 3′-RxRE sequence is also present in the 5′-end of viral transcripts (5′-RxRE), and we demonstrate that Rex binds to this RNA with essentially the same affinity and specificity as to the 3′-RxRE. We have analyzed the secondary structures and binding sites of Rex within the 5′- and 3′-RxREs by enzymatic probing and chemical modification interference and show that multiple Rex molecules bind within a stem-loop, which is similarly structured in the two RxREs. Our experiments confirm the presence of a previously characterized Rex binding site but also identify a common motif within an extended region that comprises an additional Rex binding site. This suggests that Rex oligomerizes on the RxREs similarly to what has been observed for binding of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein to the Rev response element.

Chen I.S.Y. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1849-1880Google Scholar). HTLV-II is closely related to HTLV-I when comparing genome structure and nucleotide sequence, but unlike HTLV-I, no certain correlation to diseases has been established. Like human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HTLV-I (and -II) is a complex retrovirus and as such its replication cycle is divided into an early nonproductive and a late virion-producing stage (for a review, see Ref.2Cullen B.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 375-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the early stage of infection, the regulatory proteins Tax and Rex are expressed from doubly spliced mRNA. Tax up-regulates transcription of viral as well as a number of cellular genes (1Cann A.J. Chen I.S.Y. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1849-1880Google Scholar). Rex acts at the posttranscriptional level to induce the appearance of unspliced and singly spliced viral mRNA in the cytoplasm (3Inoue J. Seiki M. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Inoue J. Yoshida M. Seiki M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These RNA species encode the structural and enzymatic polyproteins Gag, Pol, and Env, and the 9-kilobase unspliced RNA serves in addition as the viral genome. It is not yet fully clarified how HTLV-I Rex mediates the accumulation of incompletely spliced mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Recently, the leucine-rich activation domain of Rex has been shown to constitute a nuclear export signal (6Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

A. 1996; 93: 4421-4424Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, Rex may also directly inhibit splicing, as suggested by the observation that Rex alters the balance between unspliced and spliced RNA in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of T-cells (14Gröne M. Koch C. Grassmann R. Virology. 1996; 218: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that Rex specifically prevents the unspliced RNA from degradation in the nucleus (14Gröne M. Koch C. Grassmann R. Virology. 1996; 218: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Rex function requires the presence of an RNA element, the Rex response element (RxRE), present in the 3′-untranslated region of all HTLV-I transcripts (15Hanly S.M. Rimsky L.T. Malim M.H. Kim J.H.

Virol. 1990; 64: 2825-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this element has been shown to form a highly ordered secondary structure consisting of four stem-loops, A–D, and two stems, I and II (see Fig. 3 B). Rex binds directly to the RxRE in vitro (19Unge T. Solomin L. Mellini M. Derse D. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7145-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Aepinus C. Ballaun C. Boehnlein E. Fleckenstein B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3721-3727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutational analyses of the RxRE have demonstrated that Rex binding in vitro correlates with Rex function in vivo (18Ballaun C. Farrington G.K. Dobrovnik M. Rusche J. Hauber J. Bohnlein E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4408-4413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bogerd H.P. Huckaby G.L. Ahmed Y.F. Hanly S.M. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Within the RxRE, the stem-loop D has been shown to be indispensable to Rex binding and function (16Ahmed Y.F. Hanly S.M. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Toyoshima H. Itoh M. Inoue J. Seiki M. Takaku F. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2825-2832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ballaun C. Farrington G.K. Dobrovnik M. Rusche J. Hauber J. Bohnlein E. J.

A. 1991; 88: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, Rex binds the stem-loop D alone in vitro (22Bogerd H.P. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7572-7575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and modification interference studies and in vitro selection have identified a two-bulge structure within the stem-loop D as the primary binding site for Rex (22Bogerd H.P. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7572-7575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Baskerville S. Zapp M. Ellington A.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, positions outside the two-bulge structure are most likely involved in efficient Rex recognition, since this minimal element has very reduced Rex binding capacity in vitro and functionin vivo (24Gröne M. Hoffmann E. Berchtold S. Cullen B.R. Grassmann R. Virology. 1994; 204: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the retroviral replication mechanism, part of the RxRE sequence is also present in the 5′-end of the viral transcripts. Therefore, we introduce the terms 5′-RxRE and 3′-RxRE for denoting the RxRE at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the HTLV-I RNA, respectively. Importantly, the sequence forming the stem-loop D is present at both ends of the unspliced transcript. However, since the stem-loop D of the 5′-RxRE also harbors the splice donor site used for generating the spliced mRNAs encoding Env, Tax, and Rex, these mRNAs probably do not contain a functional 5′-RxRE. Considering that Rex in part regulates the cytoplasmic appearance of unspliced mRNA species, a potential regulatory mechanism resides within the 5′-RxRE. Insight into Rex activity also derives from studies of the related virus, HTLV-II. HTLV-I and -II Rex can functionally replace each other (15Hanly S.M. Rimsky L.T. Malim M.H. Kim J.H. Hauber J. Duc D.M. Le S.Y. Maizel J.V. Cullen B.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1534-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and both viruses require the presence of a functional splice donor site in the 5′-RxRE for Rex function (25Seiki M. Inoue J. Hidaka M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Black A.C. Ruland C.T. Yip M.T. Luo J. Tran B. Kalsi A. Quan E. Aboud M. Chen I.S. Rosenblatt J.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6645-6653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HTLV-II Rex has further been shown to inhibit in vitro splicing of an RNA substrate containing most of the HTLV-II R and U5 region upstream of a heterologous intron and exon but only if the Rex binding site within the 5′-RxRE is intact (27Bakker A. Li X. Ruland C.T. Stephens D.W. Black A.C. Rosenblatt J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5511-5518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in HTLV-II both the 5′-RxRE (26Black A.C. Ruland C.T. Yip M.T.

Virol. 1991; 65: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the 3′-RxRE (30Kim J.H. Kaufman P.A. Hanly S.M. Rimsky L.T. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 405-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to be functionally important. Since previous studies in HTLV-I have focused on the function of the 3′-RxRE, it remains an open question whether the 5′-RxRE plays any role in the replication cycle of HTLV-I. In this report, we compare the RNA structures and Rex binding sites within the 5′- and 3′-RxRE in HTLV-I and conclude that both structures contain similarly positioned multiple Rex binding sites. In addition to a binding site previously defined, we identify a second Rex binding site, which comprises a homologous RNA structure motif. The plasmids pGEM-3Zf(+)-RxRE, pGEM-3Zf(+)-HB-1, pGEM-3Zf(+)-HB-13, pBC12/CMV-Rex, and pBC12/CMV-Rex M1 were a gift from Bryan R. Cullen. They are described elsewhere (21Bogerd H.P. Huckaby G.L. Ahmed Y.F. Hanly S.M. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,22Bogerd H.P. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7572-7575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Rimsky L. Dodon M.D. Dixon E.P. Greene W.C. Nature. 1989; 341: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, pGEM-3Zf(+)-RxRE, pGEM-3Zf(+)-HB-1, and pGEM-3Zf(+)-HB-13 contain the nucleotides 321–563, 463–540, and 483–494 joined to 513–525, respectively, of the proviral clone CR-1 (map positions refer to Ref. 32Seiki M. Hattori S. Hirayama Y. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3618-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) inserted into the BamHI site of pGEM-3Zf(+) (Promega). The plasmid pRxRE.PIP was made by replacing the EcoRI/SalI fragment of pPIP7.A (33Jamison S.F. Crow A. Garcia B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with a PCR-amplified 5′-RxRE encoding fragment digested withEcoRI and SalI (positions 354–563 of CR-1). The PCR reaction was performed with the oligonucleotide 5′-GCGAATTCGGCTCGCATCTCTCCTTCA-3′ and a standard SP6 primer and pGEM-3Zf(+)-RxRE as template. The vectors for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged Rex and Rex M1 were made by insertion of a PCR fragment encoding Rex or Rex M1 into the EcoRI-BamHI site of pGEX/GEH. 2T. H. Jensen, unpublished results. Rex M1 is deficient in RxRE binding because of a substitution of three arginine residues in the N-terminal RNA binding domain with an aspartic acid-leucine dipeptide (Ref. 21Bogerd H.P. Huckaby G.L. Ahmed Y.F. Hanly S.M. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; data not shown). The PCR was done with either a 5′-GAGGATCCATGCCCAAGACCCGTCGGAGG-3′ oligonucleotide (for Rex synthesis) or a 5′-GAGGATCCATGCCCAAGACAGATCTGCCCCGCCG-3′ oligonucleotide (for Rex M1 synthesis) as the forward primer and a 5′-GAGAATTCCCGTGGGGCAGGAGGGGCCAGG-3′ oligonucleotide as the reverse primer and either pBC12/CMV-Rex or pBC12/CMV-Rex M1 as templates. The resulting pGEX/GEH-Rex and pGEX/GEH-Rex M1 plasmids encode fusion proteins consisting of the GST protein at the N terminus followed by a recognition site for enterokinase, the Rex or Rex M1 protein, respectively, and finally a small domain of 10 residues enabling C-terminal radiolabeling of the fusion protein with heart muscle kinase. His6-Rex and His6-Rex M1 vectors were made by PCR-amplifying the Rex encoding sequences of pGEX/GEH-Rex and pGEX/GEH-Rex M1, respectively, with the same forward primers as described above and a 5′-CCCAAGCTTCGTGGGGCAGGAGGGGCCAGG-3′-primer as reverse primer. The resultant PCR fragments were digested withBamHI and HindIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of the expression plasmid pDS-H6 (34Cochrane A.W. Chen C.H. Kramer R. Tomchak L. Rosen C.A. Virology. 1989; 173: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this context, Rex (or Rex M1) is preceded by 6 histidine residues, allowing rapid purification. All constructs were verified by sequencing. To generate sense RNA, pGEM-3Zf(+)-RxRE, pGEM-3Zf(+)-HB-1, and pRxRE.PIP were linearized with XbaI and pGEM-3Zf(+)-HB-13 was linearized with EcoRI, followed by run-off transcription. Randomly radiolabeled RNA was synthesized according to standard protocols using T7 polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 400 Ci/mmol) (35Kjems J. Calnan B.J. Frankel A.D. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1119-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Preparative amounts of unlabeled RNA were produced using the T7-MEGAshortscript™ (Ambion) including a trace amount of [α-32P]UTP. Antisense 3′-RxRE was made by transcription with SP6 polymerase and AvaI digested pGEM-3Zf(+)-RxRE as template. Stem-loop D RNA was 3′-end labeled using [α-32P]pCp prepared according to standard protocols and RNA ligase. All RNAs were gel-purified and quantified by the specific activity of 32P incorporation. GST-Rex and GST-Rex M1 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified essentially as described by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 500-ml bacterial cultures were induced at log phase with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued for an additional 1–2 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 12.5 ml of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The resuspended bacteria were lysed by gentle sonication on ice, and Triton X-100® was added to a final concentration of 1%. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with a 250-μl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B® (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C with mild agitation for 45 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 5 times with 2.5 ml of buffer A. At this step, fusion proteins bound to beads were either stored as aliquots at −80 °C in buffer A or eluted with reduced glutathione (20 mm glutathione, 100 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl) by gentle shaking at room temperature and stored at 4 °C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Bradford reactions to estimate the concentration and purity. His6-Rex and His6-Rex M1 were expressed inE. coli strain M15 (pREP4) and purified basically as outlined by the QIAGEN manual. 230-ml bacterial cultures were induced in early log phase with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for a further 4–5 h. Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 11 ml of ice-cold buffer N300 (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The suspensions were gently sonicated, and Triton X-100® was added as above. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were mixed with 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN), agitated at 4 °C for 1 h, and loaded on columns. The columns were washed with 1) 25 ml of buffer N400 (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% Triton X-100® and 2) 30 ml of buffer NG (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 6.0, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.5% Triton X-100®. Finally, the proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient of buffer NG containing 50–500 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealing that His6-Rex eluted around 200 mm imidazole. The proteins were stored at 4 °C and, when necessary, concentrated using Centricon-10® (Amicon) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For each reaction, 10 fmol of radiolabeled RNA was renatured by incubation at 80 °C for 5 min in 1 μl of renaturation buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 20 min. 0–15 pmol of GST- or His6-tagged Rex or Rex M1 protein diluted in elution buffer was preincubated on ice for 10 min with 5 μl of 2× Rex binding buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 0.64 μg/μl E. coli tRNA) and H2O to a total volume of 9 μl before the addition of 1 μl of renatured RNA. After incubation at 0 °C for 10 min, the reactions were applied to 5 or 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 100 mmTris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 3% glycerol, and run at 4 °C followed by autoradiography. In the competition experiments, renatured unlabeled RNA was incubated with Rex prior to the addition of radiolabeled RNA. One pmol of either 5′-RxRE or 3′-RxRE RNA was renatured as above in 4 μl of renaturation buffer per reaction and incubated with approximately 50 pmol of wild type or mutant Rex protein in a total volume of 20 μl of 1× Rex binding buffer. After incubation on ice for 10 min, 2 μl of water (as negative control), RNase T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 40 units/ml), T2 (Life Technologies, Inc.; 5000 units/ml), V1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 100 units/ml), or A (Sigma, 1 μg/ml) was added. Following incubation on ice for an additional 20 min, the reactions were terminated by adding 130 μl of 0.25m sodium acetate (pH 5.6), 1 mm EDTA, and RNA was recovered by extraction with phenol twice and precipitated. Half of the RNA was annealed to ∼0.02 pmol of either of two 5′-end labeled primers; RxRE P1 (5′-GTCAGGCAAAGCGTGGAG-3′) or RxRE P2 (5′-CCTAGACGGCGGACGCAG-3′). The primers were extended by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2 units/reaction), and after precipitation the cDNAs were resolved in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA. Quantification was done using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SF™ and Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software. An RNA marker sequence was obtained by adding dideoxynucleotides to reverse transcription reactions with untreated RNA as template. One μg of 3′-end labeled stem-loop D RNA was modified with either diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) or hydrazine/NaCl (Hz/NaCl) essentially as described by Peattie (36Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) and gel-purified. Approximately 0.5 pmol of renatured modified RNA was then incubated in 10 μl of 1× Rex binding buffer in the presence or absence of 25 pmol of GST-Rex or His6-Rex. After a 10-min incubation at 0 °C, the reactions were loaded on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel containing 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 3% glycerol and run at 4 °C followed by autoradiography. Free RNA and two complexed pools of RNA from lanes with GST-Rex or His6-Rex were excised from the gel and extracted. Subsequently, the RNA was treated with aniline (36Peattie D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) and analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8m urea, 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA. It is well established that purified Rex protein binds directly to the 3′-RxRE, derived from the 3′-end of viral transcripts (19Unge T. Solomin L. Mellini M. Derse D. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7145-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Grassmann R. Berchtold S. Aepinus C. Ballaun C. Boehnlein E. Fleckenstein B. J.

A. 1991; 88: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Part of the 3′-RxRE sequence is also present at the 5′-end of viral transcripts, and an in vitro transcript initiating from the proviral transcription initiation site (5′-RxRE; Fig. 1) was tested for Rex binding capacity. Two recombinant types of Rex protein containing either GST or His6 tags were expressed and purified from E. coli and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Initially, increasing amounts of GST-Rex was incubated with radiolabeled 3′-RxRE RNA in the presence of E. colitRNA as nonspecific competitor and run on a nondenaturing gel (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–8). At lower Rex concentrations, two distinct complexes are visualized (Fig.2 A, lanes 2–4), the first one being formed with an estimated K d < 16 nm. At increasing concentrations of GST-Rex, gradually slower migrating complexes are retarded in the gel (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8), indicating either the existence of multiple Rex binding sites within the 3′-RxRE or protein-protein oligomerization. To investigate the specificity of the complex formation, we made competition experiments with increasing amounts of either sense or antisense 3′-RxRE (Fig.2 A, lanes 9–14). Preincubation of GST-Rex with 125 nm unlabeled sense 3′-RxRE totally inhibited complex formation between GST-Rex and the radiolabeled probe, whereas antisense 3′-RxRE had no effect (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 13and 14 with lane 7). Purified GST protein alone had no detectable affinity for the 3′-RxRE (Fig. 2 A,lane 15). A very similar result was obtained using the 5′-RxRE as probe (Fig. 2 B). Thus, GST-Rex binds with similar affinity and specificity to both RxREs.Figure 2Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of Rex binding to various RxRE sequences. A, B, andD, the indicated concentrations of GST-Rex were tested with 3′-RxRE RNA (A), 5′-RxRE RNA (B), and stem-loop D RNA (D). C, increasing amounts of His6-Rex were incubated with 5′-RxRE RNA. The complexes were formed by incubating 10 fmol of 32P-labeled RxRE derived RNA (1 nm) with increasing amount of recombinant Rex (0–15 pmol; 0–1500 nm) in the presence of 130 pmolE. coli tRNA as nonspecific competitor. In competition experiments, Rex were preincubated with the indicated amounts of either unlabeled sense (s) or antisense (as) 3′-RxRE before the addition of radiolabeled probe. In control experiments, GST protein alone was incubated with the radiolabeled probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To increase the resolution of the higher order complexes containing Rex and the 5′-RxRE, the shorter protein His6-Rex was used in a similar mobility shift analysis. Four distinct complexes can be detected (denoted A–D in Fig. 2 C), and theK d values for the first three complexes are roughly estimated to be ∼10, ∼50, and ∼200 nm, respectively. Hence, both types of recombinant Rex bind the 5′-RxRE with similar affinity. The affinity of GST-Rex for the stem-loop D sequence alone (Fig. 1) was then examined using the same conditions as for the 5′- and 3′-RxRE, resulting in formation of two distinct complexes denoted A and B (Fig. 2 D). Again the association is specific as judged from the challenge with either sense or antisense 3′-RxRE RNA (lanes 8–13), but the affinity is approximately 30-fold lower as compared with the RxREs (K d ≈ 500 nm). Finally, a minimal RNA element, HB-13 (nucleotides 130–141 joined to 160–172), encompassing the nucleotides earlier shown to be critical to mediate Rex binding (22Bogerd H.P. Tiley L.S. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7572-7575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Baskerville S. Zapp M. Ellington A.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) displayed >100-fold lower affinity toward GST-Rex in gel mobility shift analysis as compared with the RxREs (data not shown). The observation of multiple complexes in gel mobility shift assays suggests the existence of more than one Rex binding site within the 5′- and 3′-RxRE as is the case in HIV-1, where multiple Rev binding sites within the Rev response element (RRE) are required for Rev function (37Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 38Kjems J. Sharp P.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4769-4776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mann D.A.

To map the higher order binding sites within the RxREs, we performed RNA footprinting analysis.

As a negative control, GST-Rex M1, which is deficient in RxRE binding (Ref.21Bogerd H.P. Huckaby G.L. Ahmed Y.F. Hanly S.M. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The spectroscopic properties of the mutant enzymes are altered and become similar to those of tryptophanase and aspartate aminotransferase, enzymes in which an Asp residue interacts with the pyridine nitrogen of pyridoxal phosphate. The absorption spectrum of each mutant enzyme undergoes a pH-dependent change (pK a ∼ 7.7) from a form with a protonated internal aldimine nitrogen (λmax = 416 nm) to a deprotonated form (λmax = 336 nm), whereas the absorption spectra of the wild type tryptophan synthase β2 subunit and α2β2 complex are pH-independent. The reaction of the S377D α2β2 complex withl-serine, l-tryptophan, and other substrates results in the accumulation of pronounced absorption bands (λmax = 498–510 nm) ascribed to quinonoid intermediates. We propose that the engineered Asp or Glu residue changes the cofactor chemistry by stabilizing the protonated pyridine nitrogen of pyridoxal phosphate, reducing the pK a of the internal aldimine nitrogen and promoting formation of quinonoid intermediates.

An important question in investigations of enzyme structure and function is how enzymes have evolved different reaction and substrate specificities. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; Bicine,N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. -dependent enzymes are attractive targets for addressing this question because they catalyze a wide variety of reactions of amino acids (1Metzler D.E. Ikawa M. Snell E.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 648-652Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 2Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1969: 133-146Google Scholar). The enzyme protein directs and restricts the catalytic potential of the bound PLP to provide the substrate and reaction specificity and the enhanced reaction rate of the enzyme (3Snell E.E.

Thus, it is important to understand how the protein structure controls the cofactor chemistry and enhances catalytic rates. Information on how the protein structure controls PLP-dependent reactions is beginning to emerge from x-ray crystallography and from sequence comparisons designed to establish evolutionary relationships (5Alexander F.W.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). One of the most important and best studied interactions between the cofactor and the protein active site of all PLP enzymes is that between the pyridine nitrogen of PLP and an amino acid side chain (see Fig. 1) (7Shaw J.P.

Asp223 interacts with N-1 of PLP in the structure of tryptophanase from Proteus vulgaris. this interaction is a hydrogen bond/salt bridge between the N-1 proton of PLP and a negatively charged aspartate side chain. These two enzymes are classed in the α family (5Alexander F.W. Sandmeier E. Mehta P.K. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) or fold type I (6Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J.

The PLP-binding site of the tryptophan synthase β subunit (EC4.2.1.20), 3The term β2 subunit is used for the isolated enzyme in solution; β subunit is used for the enzyme in the α2β2 complex or to describe a specific residue in the β subunit. a representative of the β family or fold type II, has the neutral hydroxyl of Ser377 interacting with PLP N-1 (9Hyde C.C.

Alanine racemase (EC 5.1.1.1; fold type III) is unique in having a positively charged arginine near N-1 of PLP (7Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Although the enzymes in the three different fold types have unrelated three-dimensional structures, the two enzymes in fold type I have related structures. These four enzymes catalyze their different reactions by the pathways illustrated in Fig.1. The primary reactions of tryptophan synthase and tryptophanase are the synthesis and degradation of l-tryptophan by β-replacement and β-elimination reactions, respectively. In this work, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to change Ser377 to Asp (βS377D) or Glu (βS377E) and have determined the effects of these mutations on some kinetic and spectroscopic properties. We have reported briefly (11Jhee K.-H. Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 67Google Scholar) that mutation of β-Ser377 to Ala, Asp, or Glu results in a >100-fold decrease in the rate of conversion of l-serine and indole to tryptophan and that the βS377D and βS377E α2β2 complexes display some spectral properties similar to those of tryptophanase and aspartate aminotransferase. PLP and β-chloro-l-alanine hydrochloride were from Sigma.l-Serine was purchased from Fluka. Solutions of β-chloro-l-alanine hydrochloride were freshly prepared and adjusted to pH 7.8 with sodium hydroxide immediately before use. Buffer A (50 mm sodium Bicine containing 1 mmEDTA at pH 7.8) was used for spectroscopic studies unless otherwise specified. The other buffer used was composed of 50 mmtriethanolamine/Bicine (pH 7.8) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2m CsCl, or 0.2 m KCl. The expression vector pEBA-10 was used as the template for quick and convenient mutagenesis by megaprimer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mutagenic primers used in the construction of the missense mutations were as follows (where base changes are underlined): S377D, 5′-GTC-AAT-CTC-GAT-GGC-CGC-GGA-GT-3′; and S377E; 5′-GTC-AAT-CTC-GAA-GGC-CGC-GGA-GTA-3′. Other primers are described (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cloning and expression plasmid for each mutant tryptophan synthase was constructed as described (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, each mutagenic primer and PE2 (which contains an XbaI restriction site) were used to amplify the first round of PCR with the pEBA-10 template plasmid using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The first PCR fragments were purified and used directly as primers together with the alternate primer PE5 (which contains anSphI restriction site) to amplify the second round of DNA synthesis with the pEBA-10 template plasmid. Deoxyadenosine (dA) was added to the newly amplified second round PCR products by the non-template-dependent activity of Taqpolymerase. The second round PCR fragments were purified and directly inserted into the linearized pCRII sequencing plasmid (Invitrogen), which has single 3′-deoxythymidine (dT) residues. After confirmation of the mutated genes by DNA sequencing, the inserted DNA fragment was restricted with SphI and XbaI restriction enzymes (Promega) and ligated into the original parent plasmid (pEBA-10), which had also been digested with SphI and XbaI. Escherichia coli CB149 (13Kawasaki H. Bauerle R. Zon G. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10678-10683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which lacks the trp operon, was used as a host strain for plasmid pEBA-10 (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that expresses the wild type and mutant β subunit forms (S377D and S377E) of the Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex. Cultures of the host harboring wild type or mutant plasmid were grown, and enzyme expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purification of wild type and mutant α2β2 complexes utilized crystallization from crude extracts followed by recrystallization (14Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of purified enzymes obtained from 1-liter cultures were 1000 mg (S377D) and 270 mg (S377E). Analysis of the purified enzymes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveal that the S377D enzyme contained a lower content of α subunit (∼50%) than the wild type α2β2 complex and that the S377E enzyme contained only β subunit (data not shown). The wild type and S377D β2 subunits were obtained by heat precipitation of the α subunit from the α2β2 complex (15Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Plasmid pEBA-4A8 was used to express the wild type α subunit inE. coli CB149 (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The α subunit was purified as described (16Yang X.-J. Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a slight modification; after DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, all fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fractions showing the single band corresponding to the α subunit were combined and concentrated. A 1-liter culture yielded ∼1 g of homogeneous α subunit. Protein concentrations were determined from the specific absorbance at 278 nm using A cm1% = 6.0 for the holo-α2β2 complex,A cm1% = 6.5 for the holo-β2 subunit, andA cm1% = 4.4 for the α subunit (15Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were measured in a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer thermostatted at 25 °C. Circular dichroism measurements (mean residue ellipticity in degrees cm2/dmol) were made in a Jasco J-500C spectrophotometer equipped with a DP-500N data processor (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Easton, MD). The effects of pH on absorbance at 416 nm were analyzed by Equation 1, EH+⇌E+H+Equation 1 where EH+ and E represent the enzyme with a protonated (416 nm species) and deprotonated (334–338 nm species) internal Schiff base, respectively. The pK a value for the dissociation of EH+ was derived from nonlinear least squares fit to Equation 2, A=Amin+(Amax−Amin)(1+Ka/[H+])Equation 2 where A is the absorbance at 416 nm andA min and A max are the minimum and maximum absorbance values, respectively. The interaction of the α and β subunits was characterized by measuring the absorbance maxima at 504 nm in the presence ofl-tryptophan as a function of α subunit concentration. The data were modeled assuming that the α and β subunits associate in a noncooperative fashion. Under this assumption, the α-β interaction can be simply modeled according to Equation 3. Kd=[α][β]/[αβ]Equation 3 The position of the equilibrium of Equation 3 can be monitored by absorbance measurements, where the maximum absorbanceA = A 0 + (A max −A 0)f αβ,f αβ = [αβ]/[β]tot,A 0 is the maximum absorbance of the β2 subunit alone with l-tryptophan (S377D and S377E), and A max is the intrinsic maximum absorbance of the α2β2 complex withl-tryptophan. The concentration of [αβ] at any given [α]tot/[β]tot ratio can be solved explicitly from Equation 4, Kd=(fα[β]tot−[αβ])([β]tot−[αβ])[αβ]Equation 4 where f α = [α]tot/[β]. The unique solution for [αβ] is described by Equation 5, [αβ]=([β]tot+fα[β]tot+Kd)−([β]tot+fα[β]tot+Kd)2−4fα[β]tot22Equation 5 and the variation of maximum absorbance (A) with the fraction of added α subunit (f α) is given by Equation 6. A=A0+(Amax−A0) ·([β]tot+fα[β]tot+Kd)−([β]tot+fα[β]tot+Kd)2−4fα[β]tot22[β]totEquation 6 The dissociation constants for the α and β subunits in the presence of l-tryptophan were obtained from Equation 6 and are termed apparent dissociation constants (K d (αβ)) because they were determined in the presence of ligands includingl-tryptophan and cations. We have altered the active site of the tryptophan synthase β subunit by changing a residue near the pyridine nitrogen (N-1) of PLP from a neutral Ser to a negatively charged Asp or Glu as found in aspartate aminotransferase and tryptophanase (Fig. 1). The engineered mutant β subunits were expressed in high yield by a vector that also expresses the wild type α subunit. Purification of the mutant β subunits by a method that has been used to purify the wild type α2β2 complex (12Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and β2 subunit (14Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Yang X.-J. Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) resulted in a partial loss of α subunit from the S377D β subunit and a complete loss of α subunit from the S377E β subunit, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results suggest that association of the S377D and S377E β subunits with the α subunit is weaker than that of the wild type β subunit, as demonstrated below. The absorption spectra of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor of the tryptophan synthase β2 subunit and α2β2 complex from E. coli (17Goldberg M.E. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and of the α2β2 complex from S. typhimurium (18Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) are pH-independent between pH 6 and 10. The absorption spectra of the S377A β2 subunit and α2β2 complex are also pH-independent (11Jhee K.-H. Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 67Google Scholar). In contrast, the absorption spectra of the S377D β2subunit (Fig.2 A) and of the S377E β2 subunit (data not shown) exhibit two pH-dependent absorption bands with maxima at 334 and 416 nm. The sharp isosbestic point indicates that there are only two significantly populated species involved. Analysis of plots of absorbance against pH at these wavelengths (Fig.2 B) shows pK a values of 7.63 ± 0.06 for this ionization for the S377D β2 subunit and of 7.89 ± 0.08 for the S377D α2β2complex. The finding that the pK a value for the S377E β2 subunit (7.78; data not shown) is 0.15 pH units higher than that for the S337D β2 subunit (7.63; Fig.2 B) is consistent with the higher pK a value for Glu (4.5) compared with Asp (4.1) in polypeptides and uncharged derivatives of Asp and Glu (19Nozaki Y. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4731-4735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the S377D α2β2 complex show that the ellipticity band with a maximum at 416 nm is also pH-dependent (Fig.2 C). The absorption band centered at 334 nm appears to be optically inactive. The wild type α2β2complex and β2 subunit catalyze β-replacement reactions with l-serine and indole or β-mercaptoethanol that proceed through a series of PLP intermediates (Fig. 1), which have characteristic absorption spectra (20Miles E.W. Dolphin D. Poulson D. Avramovic O. Pyridoxal Phosphate: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. 1B. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 253-310Google Scholar). Two quinonoid-type intermediates occur in this pathway, the first (E-Q1) after removal of the α-proton ofl-serine and the second (E-Q2) after the β-addition of a nucleophile to the aminoacrylate intermediate (E-AA). E-Q1 has been observed in rapid kinetic studies of the α2β2 complex as a transitory intermediate with maximum absorbance at 460 nm (21Drewe W.J. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but does not accumulate under equilibrium conditions.E-Q2 accumulates as a stable intermediate under steady-state conditions in reactions of the wild type α2β2 complex with l-serine and nucleophiles, including β-mercaptoethanol and indole (17Goldberg M.E. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and with the product, l-tryptophan (22Miles E.W. Hayaishi O. Ishimura Y. Kido R. Biochemical and Medical Aspects of Tryptophan Metabolism. Elsevier/North-Holand Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1980: 137-147Google Scholar, 23Tschopp J. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4514-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutation of β-Ser377 to Ala, Asp, or Glu results in a >100-fold decrease in the rate of conversion of l-serine and indole to tryptophan by the mutant α2β2complexes (11Jhee K.-H. Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 67Google Scholar). 4The activity of the S377D α2β2 complex is also very low in the reaction with β-chloro-l-alanine and indole and in β-elimination reactions with l-serine or β-chloro-l-alanine. The activities of the S377D α2β2 complexes are rather insensitive to pH between 7 and 9.5 (K.-H. Jhee, unpublished results). Nevertheless, addition of substrates to the S377D α2β2 complex in the presence of different monovalent cations results in formation of new absorption bands near 500 nm that exhibit maximum absorbance within 2.5–9 min (Fig.3 and TableI). The pronounced band that accumulates in the reaction with l-serine in the presence of Cs+ can be attributed to E-Q1. More intense bands are observed in the reactions withl-tryptophan or with l-serine and β-mercaptoethanol. These bands can be attributed toE-Q2 and exhibit absorption maxima at longer wavelengths (Table I) than quinonoid bands observed with the wild type α2β2 complex. The structure of the quinonoid (E-Q) is shown in Fig. 3. The tryptophan quinonoid has absorbance maxima at 476 and 504 nm with the wild type and S377D α2β2 complexes, respectively (Table I), whereas the quinonoid formed from l-serine and β-mercaptoethanol exhibits absorbance maxima at 468 and 508 nm with the wild type and mutant enzymes, respectively. Thel-tryptophan quinonoid has a much greater maximum absorbance with the S377D α2β2 complex (ε504 nm = 49.2 mm−1cm−1) than with the wild type α2β2 complex (ε476 nm = 1.4 mm−1 cm−1) (23Tschopp J. Kirschner K.

Open table in a new tab The quinonoid bands formed differ in stability (Table I). The half-times for disappearance range from 3 min for thel-serine intermediate in the presence of K+ to 24 h for the l-tryptophan quinonoid in the presence of Cs+ (Table I). The disappearance of thel-serine intermediate probably reflects either the slow conversion to pyruvate by the very low catalytic activity of the S377D α2β2 complex or the occurrence of irreversible inactivation of the S377D α2β2complex by a reaction intermediate or both (11Jhee K.-H. Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 67Google Scholar). The S377D β2 subunit alone forms no quinonoid intermediate from l-tryptophan in the presence of Cs+ (Fig. 4). Addition of 0.5–3.5 molar eq of α subunit results in formation of increasing amounts of the quinonoid intermediate. The insetshows a plot of the molar absorbance against the α/β subunit molar ratio. Fit of the data to Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 under “Experimental Procedures” gives values of the apparent dissociation constantK d (αβ) = 7.0 ± 0.2 μm and of 43,000 ± 160 m−1cm−1 for the maximum absorptivity at 504 nm. (The higher value of the maximum absorptivity at 504 nm, 49,200m−1 cm−1, reported in Table I was obtained with more freshly prepared enzyme.) Titration of the S377E β2 subunit with the α subunit by the same method gave values of K d (αβ) = 32 ± 3.6 μm and of 1750 ± 60 m−1cm−1 for the maximum absorptivity. Thus, association of the S377E β subunit with the α subunit is weaker than that of the S377D β subunit, consistent with the greater loss of α subunit during purification of the S377E β subunit from extracts containing α subunit. We cannot directly compare the dissociation constant for the S377D β subunit with that for the wild type β subunit because the constants have not been determined under the same conditions. The apparent dissociation constant for the S377D β subunit in the presence ofl-tryptophan and Cs+(K d (αβ) = 7.0 ± 0.16 μm) is 137-fold higher than the value ofK d (αβ) = 0.051 ± 0.005 μm determined for the wild type α and β subunits from measurements of enzymatic activity in the presence of Cs+in the reaction of l-serine with indole to forml-tryptophan (46Rowlett R. Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Jhee K.-H. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 3.5-fold higher than the value ofK d (αβ) = 2 μmdetermined from sedimentation equilibrium in the absence of ligands (24Darawshe S. Millar D.B. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Minton A.P. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 69: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The presence of l-serine is known to tighten the association between the α and β subunits (25Creighton T.E. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 980-990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The weaker association of the S377D β subunit with the α subunit is consistent with loss of approximately one α subunit during purification. The experiments described above were aimed at assessing the functional role of β-Ser377 in the PLP-binding site of tryptophan synthase and the effects of replacing this residue with a negatively charged Asp or Glu residue, which is found in several other PLP-dependent enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase and tryptophanase (see Fig. 1). Our most important results are that the mutant enzymes display pH-dependent spectral changes and exhibit enhanced formation of quinonoid intermediates. We discuss these results in relation to the chemistry of PLP and PLP-dependent enzymes. All known PLP-dependent enzymes bind PLP as an internal aldimine (Schiff base) with the ε-amino group of an enzyme lysyl residue (see E in Fig. 1). Although the equilibria and absorption spectra of PLP Schiff bases have been investigated in model systems (26Metzler C.M. Cahill A. Metzler D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 6075-6082Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar), binding of PLP to the active site of an enzyme affects the electronic and spectral properties of the PLP derivatives. The interaction of a residue X with the pyridine nitrogen (N-1) of PLP influences the electronic state of the cofactor, the equilibrium distribution between the different reaction intermediates in Fig. 1, and the pathway of catalysis. Effects of a negatively charged carboxylate (X = Asp or Glu) near N-1 of PLP are discussed here with reference to the probable structures of the low and high pH forms of internal aldimines shown in Fig.5. Interaction of the carboxylate stabilizes the proton on N-1 (Ha) (see Fig. 5) and increases the pK a by 2–5 units (7Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27Clark P.A. Jansonius J.N. Mehler E.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9789-9793Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although the position of the proton Ha cannot be determined by crystallography, semiempirical calculations of absorption spectra of aspartate aminotransferase suggest that the N-1–Asp222 pair may be present in both the charged and neutral states, i.e. Ha may be located on the carboxyl or on N-1 (27Clark P.A. Jansonius J.N. Mehler E.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9789-9793Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Although the electron-accepting properties of the pyridine ring are enhanced by protonation (7Shaw J.P. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1329-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), the presence of a negatively charged Asp near N-1 would reduce the ability of the pyridine ring to attract electrons. Semiempirical calculations of the electronic absorption spectra of PLP derivatives of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (in which X = Asp222) have been carried out using information from x-ray data (28Clark P.A. Jansonius J.N. Mehler E.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 1894-1902Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Calculations of the molecular orbital energy level for PLP in the presence of various protein residues showed that inclusion of Asp222 alone raises the molecular orbital energies by ∼3 eV relative to those of PLP. However, inclusion of groups hydrogen-bonded to Asp222 (a water molecule and the His143–Ser139hydrogen-bonded pair) substantially lowers the molecular orbital energies. Thus, in the case of aspartate aminotransferase, the charge density on active site Asp is modulated by hydrogen-bonding to other groups. The crystal structure of the wild type tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex shows the presence of no water molecules or other residues that might interact with the carboxylate that has been introduced in the βS377D mutant enzyme. It is possible that the low activities observed for the mutant enzymes (11Jhee K.-H. Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 67Google Scholar)4 result from the absence of residues that modulate the charge density of the introduced carboxylate. Although the pK a of the Schiff base nitrogen is usually well over 11 for model Schiff bases with PLP, a value close to 9.6 is observed for the Schiff base between valine and N-methyl-PLP, which has a positive charge on N-1 (29Kallen R.G. Korpela T. Martell A.E. Matsushima Y. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Morozov Y.V. Ralston I.M. Savin F.A. Torchinsky Y.M. Veno H. Christen P. Metzler D.E. Transaminases. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 60Google Scholar). This result provides evidence that the protonated state of the pyridine nitrogen (N-1) reduces the pK a of the Schiff base nitrogen by ∼2.5 units. The pH-dependent changes observed with tryptophanase and aspartate aminotransferase have been attributed to dissociation of the proton (Hb) on the Schiff base nitrogen (see Fig. 5). Tryptophanase undergoes a pH-dependent change (pK a = 7.2) from a protonated form (λmax = 420 nm) to a deprotonated form (λmax = 337 nm) in the presence of K+ (30Morino Y. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2800-2809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aspartate aminotransferase exhibits a pH-dependent conversion (pK a = 6.7) from a protonated internal form (λmax = 430 nm) to a deprotonated form (λmax = 358 nm) (31Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 1810-1815Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Yano T. Hinoue Y. Chen V.J. Metzler D.E. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Kagamiyama H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1218-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The finding that mutation of aspartate aminotransferase Asp222 to Ala (D222A) or Asn (D222N) yields enzymes with pH-independent absorption spectra provides evidence that Asp222 is indeed responsible for reducing the pK a of the Schiff base nitrogen (31Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 1810-1815Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Onuffer J.J. Kirsch J.F. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although the spectra of tryptophan synthase are pH-independent (18Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,34Goldberg M.E. York S. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the absorption spectra of the mutant enzymes engineered in this work are pH-dependent (Fig. 2). These results provide evidence that the engineered β-Asp377 or β-Glu377 interacts with the protonated N-1 of PLP and lowers the pK a of the imine nitrogen of the internal aldimine, as proposed for aspartate aminotransferase (31Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Tanase S. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 1810-1815Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Yano T. Hinoue Y. Chen V.J. Metzler D.E. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. Kagamiyama H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1218-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our finding that the wild type and S377A β2 subunits (11Jhee K.-H. Yang L.-h. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Rowlett R. Miles E.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 67Google Scholar) have pH-independent spectra similar to those of the D222A mutant of aspartate aminotransferase gives further evidence that the charge on the residue near N-1 of PLP affects the electron distribution of the cofactor. Probable structures for the high and low pH forms of the S377D and S377E mutant enzymes are shown in Fig. 5. The low pH form (structure I) with λmax = 416 nm has two protons, Ha on N-1 and Hb on the Schiff base nitrogen. Ha may reside on the carboxylate some of the time as discussed above. The high pH form (structures IIa and IIb) with λmax= 334 nm results from loss of one proton. The structure could be either a neutral form (structure IIa), resulting from dissociation of Ha and transfer of Hb to the phenolic hydroxyl, or a dipolar ionic form (structure IIb), resulting from dissociation of Hb. The observed λmax = 334 nm is consistent with that of the neutral enolimine form of the Schiff base, which is in equilibrium with the resonance-stabilized ketoenamine form in the wild type tryptophan synthase (35Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8612-8617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The enolimine form predominates following a thermally induced reversible conformational transition of the β2subunit (35Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8612-8617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The high pH form of tryptophanase also has λmax = 337 nm, consistent with an enolimine structure (36Metzler C.M. Viswanath R. Metzler D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9374-9381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37June D.S. Suelter C.H. Dye J.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2707-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38June D.S. Suelter C.H. Dye J.L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2714-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The dipolar ionic form (structure IIb) is the structure that has been suggested for the high pH form of aspartate aminotransferase, which has λmax = 360 nm (39Goldberg J.M. Swanson R.V. Goodman H.S. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Consequently, the enolimine form (structure IIa) is the more likely structure for tryptophan synthase. The locations of the protons shown in Fig. 5 cannot be established by crystallography, but can, in favorable cases, be determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy (40Metzler D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Hb dissociates around a pK a value of 6.4 with aspartate aminotransferase (40Metzler D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). According to the generally accepted mechanism of catalysis by PLP enzymes, formation of the initial enzyme-substrate intermediate (E-S in Fig. 1) is followed by withdrawal of an electron pair from the α-carbon into the pyridine ring (1Metzler D.E. Ikawa M. Snell E.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 648-652Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The electron-accepting properties of the pyridine ring are enhanced by protonation of the ring nitrogen (N-1), as discussed above. If the ring nitrogen is protonated, cleavage of the C-α–H bond leads directly to the quinonoid E-Q1 in Fig. 1 (for structure, see Fig. 3). Evidence that the presence of a proton or methyl group on N-1 of PLP facilitates quinonoid formation is provided by studies of quinonoid formation in model and enzymatic systems with pyridoxal andN-methylpyridoxal (41Metzler C.M. Harris A.G. Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4923-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Investigations of the spectra of quinonoids derived from O-methyl-PLP and PLP suggest that the proton may have migrated from the Schiff base nitrogen to O-3′ (41Metzler C.M. Harris A.G. Metzler D.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4923-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,42Chen V.J. Metzler D.E. Jenkins W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14422-14427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in the structure in Fig. 3. We conclude that replacing tryptophan synthase β subunit Ser377 with a negatively charged Asp or Glu in the PLP-binding site alters the electron distribution in the PLP derivatives. Some of the spectroscopic properties of the mutant enzymes become similar to those of tryptophanase and aspartate aminotransferase, enzymes that also have an Asp residue near N-1 of PLP, but have very different overall structures."

All these myosins that are shown to form the folded conformation are regulated themselves, and unregulated myosins like vertebrate skeletal and cardiac myosins have not yet been shown to form such folded conformations. Here we show for the first time that skeletal muscle myosin forms a folded conformation at low ionic strengths. Therefore, the folded conformation is not unique to the regulated myosins but may be common to various myosin IIs, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers in muscle and non-muscle cells. Skeletal muscle myosin was prepared from rabbit back muscle as described by Perry (12Perry S.V. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 582-588Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar), and smooth muscle myosin was from porcine aorta as described previously (13Hasegawa Y. Ueno H. Horie K. Morita F. J. Biochem.

Nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated aorta RLC were prepared as described previously (15Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2380-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase was prepared according to the method of Nagamoto and Yagi (16Nagamoto H. Yagi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Skeletal myosin was phosphorylated under the same conditions as those for the phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin (17Katoh T. Kodama T. Fukushima A. Yazawa M. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), except for the use of skeletal myosin light chain kinase. The phosphorylated myosin was purified in two cycles of precipitation by dilution with a low salt solution and by dissolving it in a high salt solution. The RLC of the obtained preparation was completely phosphorylated as judged by urea-gel electrophoresis (18Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal myosin in which RLC was exchanged to aorta RLC was prepared by incubating myosin at 37 °C with an 8-fold molar excess of aorta RLC as described previously (19Katoh T. Lowey S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The RLC in skeletal myosin was completely exchanged to aorta RLC, as judged by urea-gel electrophoresis (18Perrie W.T.

Myosin (0.2 mg/ml) in 0.12–0.5m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) was ultracentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 1 mm ATP. The myosin remaining in the supernatant was cross-linked with 5 mm1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) for 30 min at 25 °C. After the reaction was terminated with ∼5 mmdithiothreitol, the cross-linked sample was diluted 3–20-fold with 70% glycerol and 0.4 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.2) or with 70% glycerol, 0.1 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7.2). The diluted sample sprayed onto mica was rotary shadowed with platinum and observed with a Hitachi H-800 electron microscope (20Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Myosin (0.2 mg/ml) in a solution containing 0.08–0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mmimidazole (pH 7.0) in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ATP was passed through a 0.5-μm membrane filter (Millipore) to remove filaments. The myosin was then analyzed by gel filtration HPLC at the same NaCl concentration as above with 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.2) in the presence or absence of 20 μm ATP, respectively, at room temperature, using a TSK gel G5000PWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm) with a TSK guard column PWXL (6.0 × 40 mm) (20Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μm) was mixed with nonphosphorylated myosin (0.02 mg/ml, 0.08 μmhead) in 0.12–0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). After the mixture was incubated for 2 min at 25 °C, 1 mm unlabeled ATP was added. Because of the limited concentration of monomeric myosin, the incubation was prolonged to 2 min to maximize the amount of [γ-32P]ATP bound to myosin. At various times, a 150-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was filtered with a Millipore Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter unit (100,000 nominal molecular weight limit) at 5,000 × g for 1 min at 25 °C. Aliquots (50 μl) of the filtrate and reaction mixture without filtration were counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS6000SE). The amount of phosphate bound to myosin was estimated by subtracting the amount of phosphate in the filtrate from that in the reaction mixture. Smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin filaments disassemble to 10 S folded monomers after the addition of MgATP under physiological ionic conditions (∼0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0) when they are not phosphorylated (3Craig R.

Under these conditions, a small amount of skeletal muscle myosin (∼0.02 mg/ml) remains monomeric. After filamentous myosin was pelleted by ultracentrifugation, the conformation of myosin monomers remaining in the supernatant was fixed by cross-linking with EDC. The cross-linked sample was diluted with a solution containing 70% glycerol and 0.4 m ammonium acetate (pH 7.2), rotary shadowed, and examined by electron microscopy. Many of the myosin monomers were observed to have a folded structure in which the tail bent back toward the heads at one region, and the tail portion containing the C-terminal tip appeared to interact with the head-tail junction (referred to as an open folded conformation) (Figs.1 a and 2 a). When the salt concentration was increased to 0.4 m prior to the cross-linking, most of the monomers were in the extended conformation (Fig. 1 b). The salt concentration-dependent conformational change was observed, irrespective of the presence of ATP. The number of folded monomers was 62% at 0.12 m NaCl in the presence of ATP but was only 7% at 0.4 m NaCl.

Open table in a new tab b,c The salt concentration of the supernatants obtained at 0.13 m NaCl in the absence and presence of ATP, respectively, was increased to 0.4 m prior to the cross-linking. Most of the folded monomers of skeletal myosin, however, were in the open conformation, with only a low percentage in the 10 S myosin-like conformation in which the tail bends at two regions (referred to as a closed folded conformation). When the cross-linked sample was diluted with a glycerol solution more favorable for the folded conformation (50 mm ammonium acetate), the percentage of folded monomers in the closed conformation increased significantly, but the majority of folded monomers were still in the open conformation (Table I). In contrast, the folded monomers of aorta smooth muscle myosin were mostly in the closed conformation at 0.15 m and 0.3 mNaCl, although those in the open conformation increased considerably when the salt concentration was increased from 0.15 to 0.3m (Table I). The total percentage of folded monomers in smooth myosin monomers in 0.3 m NaCl was similar to that in skeletal myosin monomers in 0.12–0.15 m NaCl, but the percentage of folded monomers in the open conformation was much lower for smooth myosin than for skeletal myosin. Therefore, the major conformation of folded monomers is the open one for skeletal myosin, rather than the closed one of smooth myosin. In addition, the salt concentration-dependent fractional change from the closed to open conformation suggests a transition via the open folded conformation between the closed folded (10 S) and extended (6 S) ones. Thus, the folded monomers in the open conformation may be more easily unfolded than those in the closed conformation, leading to filament assembly. The bending position measured for the skeletal folded monomers in the open conformation was 45 ± 3 nm (n = 54) apart from the head-tail junction as normalized with a tail length of 155 nm (21Walker M. Knight P. Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This value is in agreement with the reported value for the first hinge in the skeletal muscle myosin tail (21Walker M. Knight P. Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and is considerably shorter than the corresponding length in gizzard 10 S myosin (51 nm) (1Onishi H. Wakabayashi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Skeletal myosin monomers in the closed conformation were similar in appearance to smooth muscle 10 S myosin, but the size of the folded tail was different (Fig. 2, band d). The length from the tip of tail to the second bending region that appeared to interact with the region at or near the head-tail junction was determined to be 76 ± 6 nm (n = 23), which is significantly longer than the corresponding value (60 nm) in gizzard 10 S myosin (1Onishi H. Wakabayashi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The difference of the major conformations between the folded monomers of skeletal and smooth myosins might be due to the difference in their RLCs. In fact, Trybus and Lowey (22Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16485-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that smooth muscle myosin in which RLC was replaced with skeletal RLC forms a partially folded conformation that is similar to the open folded conformation of skeletal myosin (Figs. 1 and 2). To test this possibility, the conformation of skeletal myosin in which RLC was replaced with aorta RLC was examined. The replacement with the smooth muscle RLC markedly increased the percentage of folded monomers in the closed conformation (Fig. 1 c and Table I) but essentially did not affect the amount of monomers formed, irrespective of the phosphorylation state (data not shown). The structure of the closed conformation of the RLC-exchanged skeletal myosin was indistinguishable from that of unexchanged skeletal myosin (Fig. 2, b and c). Smooth muscle RLC may stabilize the closed folded conformation more than skeletal RLC. The region of the head-tail junction including RLC may have an important role in forming the folded structure in skeletal myosin as suggested for the folding of smooth muscle myosin (17Katoh T. Kodama T. Fukushima A. Yazawa M. Morita F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 428-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 22Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20375-20384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The conformational transition of skeletal myosin monomers was also examined by gel filtration HPLC on which the 6 S extended and 10 S folded monomers of smooth muscle myosin have been shown to be eluted at different times (20Katoh T. Morita F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9992-9996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Trybus K.M. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16485-16492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3 a). The elution time for skeletal myosin increased gradually as the concentration of NaCl decreased to below ∼0.2 m, irrespective of the presence of ATP, consistent with the results observed upon electron microscopy (Table I and Figs. 1 and 2). The gradual change in elution time suggests rapid equilibrium between the extended and folded forms and a salt concentration-dependent shift of equilibrium. The elution profile, however, was independent of the phosphorylation of RLC and of the presence of ATP (Fig. 3 b). Replacement with aorta RLC did not change the ATP and phosphorylation independencies but slightly increased the elution time (Fig. 3 b), consistent with the results of electron microscopy (Table I). As one of the profound features, the folded monomers of myosins from vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle and from scallop striated muscle are shown to trap the products of ATP hydrolysis, ADP and Pi, in the active site (8Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Cross R.A. Cross K.E. Sobieszek A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Cross R.A. Jackson A.P. Citi S. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To examine whether the folded monomers of skeletal myosin trap the hydrolysis products, single turnover experiments were carried out with 0.02 mg/ml nonphosphorylated myosin. The rate of phosphate release from aorta nonphosphorylated myosin at 0.12 m was ∼0.0004 s−1, and the amount of phosphate bound to myosin at 0 time was estimated to be 0.7 mol/mol head, consistent with the previous results (10Cross R.A. Cross K.E. Sobieszek A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Cross R.A. Jackson A.P. Citi S. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The rate was increased to ∼0.004 s−1 with an increase in the concentration of NaCl to 0.3 m at which the fraction of folded monomers in aorta myosin was comparable with that in skeletal myosin at 0.12 m NaCl (Table I). However, the rate for skeletal myosin at 0.12 m NaCl was higher than 0.015 s−1, which was significantly higher than the value for aorta myosin at 0.3 m NaCl and was similar to the values for aorta and skeletal myosins at 0.4 m NaCl at which these myosins were both in the extended conformation (Table I and Fig. 3). These results indicate that skeletal myosin monomers in the open folded conformation may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis. Potential formation of a folded structure in skeletal myosin has been shown by negative staining of myosin in a high salt solution (21Walker M. Knight P. Trinick J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Here we showed that skeletal myosin was folded under physiological conditions as observed for smooth muscle and non-muscle myosins, suggestive of common roles for the folded monomers in these myosins. However, such folded monomers have been detected only in gizzard smooth muscle cells (24Horowitz A. Trybus K.M. Bowman D.S. Fay F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the actual biological significance of folding remains unknown. Of potential significance common to the folded monomers is their compact form, which is suitable for transport in cells. This seems to be particularly important in non-muscle cells in which myosin molecules must be transported to the intracellular locus where contractile activity is needed. In muscle cells, the transportation of myosin molecules may also be required for the formation of thick filaments at appropriate locations, at least at certain stages of development and/or for the turnover of myosin molecules in the thick filaments. In line with this speculation, the existence of folded monomers is also mentioned for vertebrate cardiac myosins (8Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to vertebrate myosins, molluscan smooth and striated muscle myosins have been shown to form the folded conformation (7Takahashi M. Fukushima Y. Inoue K. Hasegawa Y. Morita F. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol.

The conformational transition of myosins other than vertebrate striated myosin can be regulated by phosphorylation of RLC or the tail, or by the binding of Ca2+ (2Trybus K.M. Huiatt T.W. Lowey S.

A. 1987; 84: 4058-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The folded monomers of these myosins are stable and thus resistant to filament assembly until regulatory signals promote unfolding. The folded monomers trap the products of ATP hydrolysis, thus their ATPase activities are very low (8Ankrett R.J. Rowe A.J. Cross R.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Cross R.A. Cross K.E. Sobieszek A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Cross R.A. Jackson A.P. Citi S. Kendrick-Jones J. Bagshaw C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Such properties would be suitable for cells in which relatively large amounts of myosin molecules need to be transported. On the other hand, the conformational transition of skeletal myosin monomers is not regulated, and folded monomers are unstable under physiological conditions and may not trap the products of ATP hydrolysis. Only a small amount of myosin may need to be transported in skeletal muscle cells. The transported folded monomers are in rapid equilibrium with the extended monomers, which can easily be incorporated or exchanged into myosin filaments. Therefore, the myosin filaments are stabilized without a distinct regulatory mechanism and are ready for rapid contraction in skeletal muscle cells."
