https://openalex.org/W4312211449,"The perinatal period represents a critical window for cognitive and immune system development, promoted by maternal and infant gut microbiomes and their metabolites. Here, we tracked the co-development of microbiomes and metabolomes from late pregnancy to 1 year of age using longitudinal multi-omics data from a cohort of 70 mother-infant dyads. We discovered large-scale mother-to-infant interspecies transfer of mobile genetic elements, frequently involving genes associated with diet-related adaptations. Infant gut metabolomes were less diverse than maternal but featured hundreds of unique metabolites and microbe-metabolite associations not detected in mothers. Metabolomes and serum cytokine signatures of infants who received regular-but not extensively hydrolyzed-formula were distinct from those of exclusively breastfed infants. Taken together, our integrative analysis expands the concept of vertical transmission of the gut microbiome and provides original insights into the development of maternal and infant microbiomes and metabolomes during late pregnancy and early life."
https://openalex.org/W4312140670,"Antibody responses are characterized by increasing affinity and diversity over time. Affinity maturation occurs in germinal centers by a mechanism that involves repeated cycles of somatic mutation and selection. How antibody responses diversify while also undergoing affinity maturation is not as well understood. Here, we examined germinal center (GC) dynamics by tracking B cell entry, division, somatic mutation, and specificity. Our experiments show that naive B cells continuously enter GCs where they compete for T cell help and undergo clonal expansion. Consistent with late entry, invaders carry fewer mutations but can contribute up to 30% or more of the cells in late-stage germinal centers. Notably, cells entering the germinal center at later stages of the reaction diversify the immune response by expressing receptors that show low affinity to the immunogen. Paradoxically, the affinity threshold for late GC entry is lowered in the presence of high-affinity antibodies."

The duration of GC reactions spans a wide range, and long-lasting GCs (LLGCs) are potentially a source of highly mutated B cells. We show that rather than consisting of continuously evolving B cell clones, LLGCs elicited by influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice are sustained by progressive replacement of founder clones by naive-derived invader B cells that do not detectably bind viral antigens. Rare founder clones that resist replacement for long periods are enriched in clones with heavily mutated immunoglobulins, including some with very high affinity for antigen, that can be recalled by boosting. Our findings reveal underappreciated aspects of the biology of LLGCs generated by respiratory virus infection and identify clonal replacement as a potential constraint on the development of highly mutated antibodies within these structures.

This work shows that the ongoing germinal center is replenished with naive B cells that skew the repertoire toward lower affinity, suggesting that there is a trade-off between the overall specificity and breadth of the repertoire that can be induced.

https://openalex.org/W4312211397,"To define the multi-cellular epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of cardiac cellular development, we generated single-cell chromatin accessibility maps of human fetal heart tissues. We identified eight major differentiation trajectories involving primary cardiac cell types, each associated with dynamic transcription factor (TF) activity signatures. We contrasted regulatory landscapes of iPSC-derived cardiac cell types and their in vivo counterparts, which enabled optimization of in vitro differentiation of epicardial cells. Further, we interpreted sequence based deep learning models of cell-type-resolved chromatin accessibility profiles to decipher underlying TF motif lexicons. De novo mutations predicted to affect chromatin accessibility in arterial endothelium were enriched in congenital heart disease (CHD) cases vs. controls. In vitro studies in iPSCs validated the functional impact of identified variation on the predicted developmental cell types. This work thus defines the cell-type-resolved cis-regulatory sequence determinants of heart development and identifies disruption of cell type-specific regulatory elements in CHD."
https://openalex.org/W4312212135,"Our bodies turn over billions of cells daily via apoptosis and are in turn cleared by phagocytes via the process of ""efferocytosis."" Defects in efferocytosis are now linked to various inflammatory diseases. Here, we designed a strategy to boost efferocytosis, denoted ""chimeric receptor for efferocytosis"" (CHEF). We fused a specific signaling domain within the cytoplasmic adapter protein ELMO1 to the extracellular phosphatidylserine recognition domains of the efferocytic receptors BAI1 or TIM4, generating BELMO and TELMO, respectively. CHEF-expressing phagocytes display a striking increase in efferocytosis. In mouse models of inflammation, BELMO expression attenuates colitis, hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. In mechanistic studies, BELMO increases ER-resident enzymes and chaperones to overcome protein-folding-associated toxicity, which was further validated in a model of ER-stress-induced renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Finally, TELMO introduction after onset of kidney injury significantly reduced fibrosis. Collectively, these data advance a concept of chimeric efferocytic receptors to boost efferocytosis and dampen inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4312192969,"Identification of structural connections between neurons is a prerequisite to understanding brain function. Here we developed a pipeline to systematically map brain-wide monosynaptic input connections to genetically defined neuronal populations using an optimized rabies tracing system. We used mouse visual cortex as the exemplar system and revealed quantitative target-specific, layer-specific and cell-class-specific differences in its presynaptic connectomes. The retrograde connectivity indicates the presence of ventral and dorsal visual streams and further reveals topographically organized and continuously varying subnetworks mediated by different higher visual areas. The visual cortex hierarchy can be derived from intracortical feedforward and feedback pathways mediated by upper-layer and lower-layer input neurons. We also identify a new role for layer 6 neurons in mediating reciprocal interhemispheric connections. This study expands our knowledge of the visual system connectomes and demonstrates that the pipeline can be scaled up to dissect connectivity of different cell populations across the mouse brain. The authors developed an optimized rabies tracing system for generating brain-wide monosynaptic input connectomes, and applied it in mouse visual cortex to reveal topographically organized subnetworks co-defined by visual areas, layers and cell classes."
https://openalex.org/W4313281074,"Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is the highly conserved process by which proteins are transported along ciliary microtubules by a train-like polymeric assembly of IFT-A and IFT-B complexes. IFT-A is sandwiched between IFT-B and the ciliary membrane, consistent with its putative role in transporting transmembrane and membrane-associated cargoes. Here, we have used single-particle analysis electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures of native IFT-A complexes. We show that subcomplex rearrangements enable IFT-A to polymerize laterally on anterograde IFT trains, revealing a cooperative assembly mechanism. Surprisingly, we discover that binding of IFT-A to IFT-B shields the preferred lipid-binding interface from the ciliary membrane but orients an interconnected network of β-propeller domains with the capacity to accommodate diverse cargoes toward the ciliary membrane. This work provides a mechanistic basis for understanding IFT-train assembly and cargo interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4312112879,"We use mental models of the world-cognitive maps-to guide behavior. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) is typically thought to support behavior by deploying these maps to simulate outcomes, but recent evidence suggests that it may instead support behavior by underlying map creation. We tested between these two alternatives using outcome-specific devaluation and a high-potency chemogenetic approach. Selectively inactivating lOFC principal neurons when male rats learned distinct cue-outcome associations, but before outcome devaluation, disrupted subsequent inference, confirming a role for the lOFC in creating new maps. However, lOFC inactivation surprisingly led to generalized devaluation, a result that is inconsistent with a complete mapping failure. Using a reinforcement learning framework, we show that this effect is best explained by a circumscribed deficit in credit assignment precision during map construction, suggesting that the lOFC has a selective role in defining the specificity of associations that comprise cognitive maps."

https://openalex.org/W4312181332,"Abstract While initial encoding of contextual memories involves the strengthening of hippocampal circuits, these memories progressively mature to stabilized forms in neocortex and become less hippocampus dependent. Although it has been proposed that long-term storage of contextual memories may involve enduring synaptic changes in neocortical circuits, synaptic substrates of remote contextual memories have been elusive. Here we demonstrate that the consolidation of remote contextual fear memories in mice correlated with progressive strengthening of excitatory connections between prefrontal cortical (PFC) engram neurons active during learning and reactivated during remote memory recall, whereas the extinction of remote memories weakened those synapses. This synapse-specific plasticity was CREB-dependent and required sustained hippocampal signals, which the retrosplenial cortex could convey to PFC. Moreover, PFC engram neurons were strongly connected to other PFC neurons recruited during remote memory recall. Our study suggests that progressive and synapse-specific strengthening of PFC circuits can contribute to long-term storage of contextual memories."
https://openalex.org/W4312129570,"Abstract Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a highly conserved protein essential for DNA replication, repair and scaffold functions in the cytosol. Specific inhibition of PCNA in cancer cells is an attractive anti-cancer strategy. ATX-101 is a first-in-class drug targeting PCNA, primarily in cellular stress regulation. Multiple in vivo and in vitro investigations demonstrated anti-cancer activity of ATX-101 in many tumor types and a potentiating effect on the activity of anti-cancer therapies. Healthy cells were less affected. Based on preclinical data, a clinical phase 1 study was initiated. Twenty-five patients with progressive, late-stage solid tumors were treated with weekly ATX-101 infusions at four dose levels (20, 30, 45, 60 mg/m 2 ). ATX-101 showed a favorable safety profile supporting that vital cellular functions are not compromised in healthy cells. Mild and moderate infusion-related reactions were observed in 64% of patients. ATX-101 was quickly cleared from blood with elimination half-lives of less than 30 min at all dose levels, probably due to both, a quick cell penetration and peptide digestion in serum, as demonstrated in vivo. No tumor responses were observed but stable disease was seen in 70% of the efficacy population ( n = 20). Further studies have been initiated to provide evidence of efficacy.

https://openalex.org/W4312130035,"Inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and obstructive bowel disorder (OBD) underlie the most prevalent forms of visceral pain. Although visceral pain can be generally provoked by mechanical distension/stretch, the mechanisms that underlie visceral mechanosensitivity in colon-innervating visceral afferents remain elusive. Here, we show that virally mediated ablation of colon-innervating TRPV1-expressing nociceptors markedly reduces colorectal distention (CRD)-evoked visceromotor response (VMR) in mice. Selective ablation of the stretch-activated Piezo2 channels from TRPV1 lineage neurons substantially reduces mechanically evoked visceral afferent action potential firing and CRD-induced VMR under physiological conditions, as well as in mouse models of zymosan-induced IBS and partial colon obstruction (PCO). Collectively, our results demonstrate that mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels expressed by TRPV1-lineage nociceptors powerfully contribute to visceral mechanosensitivity and nociception under physiological conditions and visceral hypersensitivity under pathological conditions in mice, uncovering potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of visceral pain."
https://openalex.org/W4312210215,"To track and control self-location, animals integrate their movements through space. Representations of self-location are observed in the mammalian hippocampal formation, but it is unknown if positional representations exist in more ancient brain regions, how they arise from integrated self-motion, and by what pathways they control locomotion. Here, in a head-fixed, fictive-swimming, virtual-reality preparation, we exposed larval zebrafish to a variety of involuntary displacements. They tracked these displacements and, many seconds later, moved toward their earlier location through corrective swimming (""positional homeostasis""). Whole-brain functional imaging revealed a network in the medulla that stores a memory of location and induces an error signal in the inferior olive to drive future corrective swimming. Optogenetically manipulating medullary integrator cells evoked displacement-memory behavior. Ablating them, or downstream olivary neurons, abolished displacement corrections. These results reveal a multiregional hindbrain circuit in vertebrates that integrates self-motion and stores self-location to control locomotor behavior."

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a valuable model system for studying this modification. The bulk of protein N-terminal acetylation in S. cerevisiae is catalyzed by the N-terminal acetyltransferases NatA, NatB, and NatC. Thus far, proteome-wide identification of the in vivo protein substrates of yeast NatA and NatB has been performed by N-terminomics. Here, we used S. cerevisiae deleted for the NatC catalytic subunit Naa30 and identified 57 yeast NatC substrates by N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography analysis. Interestingly, in addition to the canonical N-termini starting with ML, MI, MF, and MW, yeast NatC substrates also included MY, MK, MM, MA, MV, and MS. However, for some of these substrate types, such as MY, MK, MV, and MS, we also uncovered (residual) non-NatC NAT activity, most likely due to the previously established redundancy between yeast NatC and NatE/Naa50. Thus, we have revealed a complex interplay between different NATs in targeting methionine-starting N-termini in yeast. Furthermore, our results showed that ectopic expression of human NAA30 rescued known NatC phenotypes in naa30Δ yeast, as well as partially restored the yeast NatC Nt-acetylome. Thus, we demonstrate an evolutionary conservation of NatC from yeast to human thereby underpinning future disease models to study pathogenic NAA30 variants. Overall, this work offers increased biochemical and functional insights into NatC-mediated N-terminal acetylation and provides a basis for future work to pinpoint the specific molecular mechanisms that link the lack of NatC-mediated N-terminal acetylation to phenotypes of NatC deletion yeast.

https://openalex.org/W4312207665,"Background Some studies found that red blood cell count (RBC) was an unrecognized risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). While the epidemiological data underpinning the evidence is very limited. As there are some differences between the latest criteria of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and NAFLD, itis necessary to evaluate the relationship between RBC and MAFLD. Methods We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES)2017-2018 cohort, including 4477 participants. Hepatic steatosis was determined when the value of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) obtained by Fibroscan was ≥274 dB/m. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between RBC and MAFLD. We estimated the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of RBC for MAFLD, and the nonlinear relationship between RBC and MAFLD was further described using smooth curve fittings and threshold-effect analysis. Results We found that MAFLD risk was significantly higher according to RBC quartiles. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)for the highest RBC quartile were 1.5(1.0, 2.3) for male and 1.1 (0.8, 1.6) for female, respectively. As for male, a non-linear relationship was discovered between RBCs and MAFLD, with a RBC threshold of 4.2. The effect sizes and confidence intervals on the right side of the inflection point were 1.5 (1.0, 2.0) (P for nonlinearity = 0.027). The sensitivity analysis showed a similar result. Conclusion We demonstrated that that elevated RBC level is associated with the higher risk of MAFLD in male. The positive relationship was not significant in females after full adjustment. Our finding provided novel evidence indicating that RBCs might be a potential biomarker for MAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4312115034,"Corticothalamic pathways, responsible for the top-down control of the thalamus, have a canonical organization such that every cortical region sends output from both layer 6 (L6) and layer 5 (L5) to the thalamus. Here we demonstrate a qualitative, region-specific difference in the organization of mouse corticothalamic pathways. Specifically, L5 pyramidal cells of the frontal cortex, but not other cortical regions, establish monosynaptic connections with the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The frontal L5-TRN pathway parallels the L6-TRN projection but has distinct morphological and physiological features. The exact spike output of the L5-contacted TRN cells correlated with the level of cortical synchrony. Optogenetic perturbation of the L5-TRN connection disrupted the tight link between cortical and TRN activity. L5-driven TRN cells innervated thalamic nuclei involved in the control of frontal cortex activity. Our data show that frontal cortex functions require a highly specialized cortical control over intrathalamic inhibitory processes."
https://openalex.org/W4312115334,"Transcriptional and translational control are key determinants of gene expression, however, to what extent these two processes can be collectively coordinated is still poorly understood. Here, we use Nanopore long-read sequencing and cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE-seq) to document the landscape of 5' and 3' untranslated region (UTR) isoforms and transcription start sites of epidermal stem cells, wild-type keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinomas. Focusing on squamous cell carcinomas, we show that a small cohort of genes with alternative 5'UTR isoforms exhibit overall increased translational efficiencies and are enriched in ribosomal proteins and splicing factors. By combining polysome fractionations and CAGE-seq, we further characterize two of these UTR isoform genes with identical coding sequences and demonstrate that the underlying transcription start site heterogeneity frequently results in 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) and pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) motif switches to drive mTORC1-dependent translation of the mRNA. Genome-wide, we show that highly translated squamous cell carcinoma transcripts switch towards increased use of 5'TOP and PRTE motifs, have generally shorter 5'UTRs and expose decreased RNA secondary structures. Notably, we found that the two 5'TOP motif-containing, but not the TOP-less, RPL21 transcript isoforms strongly correlated with overall survival in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Our findings warrant isoform-specific analyses in human cancer datasets and suggest that switching between 5'UTR isoforms is an elegant and simple way to alter protein synthesis rates, set their sensitivity to the mTORC1-dependent nutrient-sensing pathway and direct the translational potential of an mRNA by the precise 5'UTR sequence."

However, whether and how these ensembles are coordinated at the time of learning remains largely unknown. Here, we combined CREB-mediated memory allocation with transsynaptic retrograde tracing to demonstrate that the allocation of aversive memories to a group of neurons in one brain region directly affects the allocation of interconnected neurons in upstream brain regions in a behavioral- and brain region-specific manner in mice. Our analysis suggests that this cross-regional recruitment of presynaptic neurons is initiated by downstream memory neurons through a retrograde mechanism. Together with statistical modeling, our results indicate that in addition to the anterograde flow of information between brain regions, the establishment of interconnected, brain-wide memory traces relies on a retrograde mechanism that coordinates memory ensembles at the time of learning."
https://openalex.org/W4312195837,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) has been proven to participate in the ubiquitination of multiple substrate proteins. However, the underlying mechanisms of UBE2J1 as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in cancer development and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that UBE2J1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines which are mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter, and decreased UBE2J1 is associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, UBE2J1 serving as a suppressor gene inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, UBE2J1-TRIM25, forming an E2-E3 complex, physically interacts with and targets RPS3 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K214 residue. The downregulated RPS3 caused by UBE2J1 overexpression restrains NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and therefore inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study revealed a novel role of UBE2J1-mediated RPS3 poly-ubiquitination and degradation in disrupting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may serve as a novel and promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC."
https://openalex.org/W4312055907,"Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element; it serves as a cofactor for a great number of enzymes, transcription factors, receptors, and other proteins. Zinc is also an important signaling molecule, which can be released from intracellular stores into the cytosol or extracellular space, for example, during synaptic transmission. Amongst cellular effects of zinc is activation of Kv7 (KCNQ, M-type) voltage-gated potassium channels. Here, we investigated relationships between Kv7 channel inhibition by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) and zinc-mediated potentiation. We show that Zn2+ ionophore, zinc pyrithione (ZnPy), can prevent or reverse Ca2+/CaM-mediated inhibition of Kv7.2. In the presence of both Ca2+ and Zn2+, the Kv7.2 channels lose most of their voltage dependence and lock in an open state. In addition, we demonstrate that mutations that interfere with CaM binding to Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 reduced channel membrane abundance and activity, but these mutants retained zinc sensitivity. Moreover, the relative efficacy of ZnPy to activate these mutants was generally greater, compared with the WT channels. Finally, we show that zinc sensitivity was retained in Kv7.2 channels assembled with mutant CaM with all four EF hands disabled, suggesting that it is unlikely to be mediated by CaM. Taken together, our findings indicate that zinc is a potent Kv7 stabilizer, which may protect these channels from physiological inhibitory effects of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, protecting neurons from overactivity."
https://openalex.org/W4312056046,"KIF1A is an essential neuronal transport motor protein in the kinesin-3 family, known for its superprocessive motility. However, structural features underlying this function are unclear. Here, we determined that superprocessivity of KIF1A dimers originates from a unique structural domain, the lysine-rich insertion in loop-12 termed the 'K-loop', which enhances electrostatic interactions between the motor and the microtubule. In 80 mM PIPES buffer, replacing the native KIF1A loop-12 with that of kinesin-1 resulted in a 6-fold decrease in run length, whereas adding additional positive charge to loop-12 enhanced the run length. Interestingly, swapping the KIF1A loop-12 into kinesin-1 did not enhance its run length, consistent with the two motor families using different mechanochemical tuning to achieve persistent transport. To investigate the mechanism by which the KIF1A K-loop enhances processivity, we used microtubule pelleting and single-molecule dwell time assays in ATP and ADP. First, the microtubule affinity was similar in ATP and in ADP, consistent with the motor spending the majority of its cycle in a weakly bound state. Second, the microtubule affinity and single-molecule dwell time in ADP were 6-fold lower in the loop-swap mutant than WT. Thus, the positive charge in loop-12 of KIF1A enhances the run length by stabilizing binding of the motor in its vulnerable one-head-bound state. Finally, through a series of mutants with varying positive charge in the K-loop, we found that KIF1A processivity is linearly dependent on the charge of loop-12, further highlighting how loop-12 contributes to the function of this key motor protein."

We provide evidence in support of hyperinsulinemia being caused by deregulation of KATP channels in the β cells and that this is partly mediated by HNF4A. Finally, we show that INS hypersecretion can be rescued by pharmacologically targeting KATP and low-voltage-gated calcium channels.

Analyses of the expression of crucial pancreatic transcription factors and the main pancreatic hormones at the pancreatic progenitor stage (S4) and at the β cell stage (S7) revealed that HNF1A+/R272C cells are fully capable of differentiating into β cells (Figures 1C–1E, S2B–S2E, S3A, and S3B).

We further aimed to validate the hypersecretion phenotype of HNF1A+/R272C β cells in a more physiological relevant in vivo niche. We therefore transplanted corrected control and mutant S7 cells under the kidney capsule of immunocompromised mice. The function of the engrafted S7 cells were tested 4 to 11 weeks post-transplantation by measuring circulating human CPEP in serum samples taken from mice carrying grafts of either corrected control or mutant S7 cells. Importantly, the HNF1A+/R272C grafts displayed significantly increased INS secretion both in fasted conditions from 6 weeks post-transplantation, and in glucose-challenged and random fed conditions from 10 weeks post-transplantation (Figures 3A–3C). At 14 weeks post-transplantation INS+/GCG− and GCG+/INS− cells were observed in clusters in both HNF1AR272C/+ and corrected control grafts (Figure 3D). Quantification of the number of β cells showed no significant difference between HNF1AR272C/+ and corrected control grafts, indicating that the hyperinsulinemia could not be explained by a survival advantage conveyed by the HNF1A+/R272C mutation (Figures 3E and 3F; Table S1). Taken together, these findings indicate that INS hypersecretion precedes HNF1A+/R272C β cell failure. To elucidate the underlying mechanism for INS hypersecretion in HNF1A+/R272C β cells, we analyzed the transcriptomes of sorted CPEP+/NKX6-1+ β cells by RNA sequencing (Figures 4A and S4A). Principal-component analysis (PCA) separated the transcriptomes of HNF1A+/R272C and corrected control β cells in PC1 (explaining 69% of the variance), which indicates that the genotype is the primary source of variance (Figure S4B). We identified 410 downregulated and 281 upregulated genes in the HNF1A+/R272C β cells (Figure S4C).

Dysregulation of these genes may contribute to the ultimate development of an INS secretion defect in MODY3 patients, but it cannot directly explain the observed INS hypersecretion phenotype. On the contrary, gene set enrichment analysis identified an overrepresentation of ion transport and membrane potential regulators (Figures 4C, 4D, and S4F). These gene expression changes could result in increased INS secretion via perturbed membrane potential. We validated the altered expression of a subset of potassium channels (KCNA3, KCNK9, and HCN1), calcium channels (CACNA1B), and KATP channel regulators (SRC and ANK2) in HNF1A+/R272C β cells by RT-qPCR (Figure 4B). Although the RNA sequencing showed no change in the expression of the SU target, the main KATP channel in β cells (Figure S4G), reexamination by RT-qPCR analysis revealed reduced expression of both subunits, ABCC8 (SUR1) and KCNJ11 (Kir6.2), in HNF1A+/R272C β cells (Figure 4B). RT-qPCR analysis also showed downregulation of a potassium channel (KCNH6) and an intracellular calcium channel (ATP2A3) in HNF1A+/R272C β cells, confirming previous studies based on hESC-derived β cells carrying HNF1A null mutations (Figure 4B).16Cardenas-Diaz F.L.

https://openalex.org/W4312113510,"The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex plays a crucial role in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) sensing and initiation of signaling cascades. However, the precise mechanisms by which the recruitment of MRN complex is regulated has yet to be elucidated. Here, we identified TRIpartite motif-containing protein 24 (TRIM24), a protein considered as an oncogene overexpressed in cancers, as a novel signaling molecule in response to DSBs. TRIM24 is essential for DSBs-induced recruitment of MRN complex and activation of downstream signaling. In the absence of TRIM24, MRN mediated DSBs repair is remarkably diminished. Mechanistically, TRIM24 is phosphorylated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and then recruited to DSBs sites, facilitating the accumulation of the MRN components to chromatin. Depletion of TRIM24 sensitizes human hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cancer therapy agent-induced apoptosis and retards the tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft tumor mouse model. Together, our data reveal a novel function of TRIM24 in response to DSBs through regulating the MRN complex, which suggests that TRIM24 may be a potential therapeutic molecular target for tumor treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4312129917,"RING-between RING (RBR)-type ubiquitin (Ub) ligases (E3s) such as Parkin receive Ub from Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2s) in response to ligase activation. However, the specific E2s that transfer Ub to each RBR-type ligase are largely unknown because of insufficient methods for monitoring their interaction. To address this problem, we have developed a method that detects intracellular interactions between E2s and activated Parkin. Fluorescent homotetramer Azami-Green fused with E2 and oligomeric Ash (Assembly helper) fused with Parkin form a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cells only when E2 and Parkin interact. Using this method, we identified multiple E2s interacting with activated Parkin on damaged mitochondria during mitophagy. Combined with in vitro ubiquitination assays and bioinformatics, these findings revealed an underlying consensus sequence for E2 interactions with activated Parkin. Application of this method to other RBR-type E3s including HOIP, HHARI, and TRIAD1 revealed that HOIP forms an LLPS with its substrate NEMO in response to a proinflammatory cytokine and that HHARI and TRIAD1 form a cytosolic LLPS independent of Ub-like protein NEDD8. Since an E2-E3 interaction is a prerequisite for RBR-type E3 activation and subsequent substrate ubiquitination, the method we have established here can be an in-cell tool to elucidate the potentially novel mechanisms involved in RBR-type E3s."
https://openalex.org/W4312130086,"The essential roles of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a scaffold protein in DNA replication and repair are well established, while its cytosolic roles are less explored. Two metabolic enzymes, alpha-enolase (ENO1) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), both contain PCNA interacting motifs. Mutation of the PCNA interacting motif APIM in ENO1 (F423A) impaired its binding to PCNA and resulted in reduced cellular levels of ENO1 protein, reduced growth rate, reduced glucose consumption, and reduced activation of AKT. Metabolome and signalome analysis reveal large consequences of impairing the direct interaction between PCNA and ENO1. Metabolites above ENO1 in glycolysis accumulated while lower glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolite pools decreased in the APIM-mutated cells; however, their overall energetic status were similar to parental cells. Treating haematological cancer cells or activated primary monocytes with a PCNA targeting peptide drug containing APIM (ATX-101) also lead to a metabolic shift characterized by reduced glycolytic rate. In addition, we show that ATX-101 treatments reduced the ENO1 - PCNA interaction, the ENO1, GAPDH and 6PGD protein levels, as well as the 6PGD activity. Here we report for the first time that PCNA acts as a scaffold for metabolic enzymes, and thereby act as a direct regulator of primary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4312207714,"Every year, a large amount of solid waste such as fly ash and slag is generated worldwide. If these solid wastes are used in concrete mixes to make concrete, it can effectively save resources and protect the environment. The compressive strength of concrete is an essential indicator for testing its quality, and its prediction is affected by many factors. It is difficult to predict its strength accurately. Therefore, based on the current popular machine learning supervised learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVR), three models established a nonlinear mapping between multi-factor features and target feature concrete compressive strength. Using the three completed training models, we validated the test set with 206 example sets, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), fitting coefficient (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were used as evaluation metrics. The validation results showed that the values of RMSE, R2, and MAE for the RF model were 0.1, 0.9, and 0.21, respectively; the values of XGBoost model were 0.05, 0.95, and 0.15, respectively. The values of SVR were 0.15, 0.86, and 0.3, respectively. As a result, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) has better generalization ability and prediction accuracy than the other two algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W4312207958,"The rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque is the main cause of acute ischemic vascular events, and is characterized by pathological degradation of matrix collagen in the fibrous cap. In a previous study, we reported that 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated sonodynamic therapy suppressed collagen degradation in rabbit plaque. However, the underlying molecular mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated.We applied sinoporphyrin sodium-mediated sonodynamic therapy (DVDMS-SDT) to balloon-denuded rabbit and apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mouse models to observe collagen content in plaque. Cultured human THP-1 and mouse peritoneal macrophage-derived foam cells were used for in vitro mechanistic studies.We observed that DVDMS-SDT decreased plaque area and increased the percentages of collagen and smooth muscle cells and reduced the percentage of macrophages in rabbit and ApoE-/- mouse advanced plaques. In vitro, DVDMS-SDT modulated the caspase 3-pigment epithelium-derived factor/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (PEDF/HIF-1α)-matrix metalloprotease-2/9 (MMP-2/MMP-9) signaling in macrophage foam cells.Our findings show that DVDMS-SDT effectively inhibits matrix collagen degradation in advanced atherosclerotic plaque by modulating caspase 3-PEDF/HIF-1α-MMP-2/MMP-9 signaling in macrophage foam cells and therefore represents a suitable and promising clinical regimen to stabilize vulnerable plaques."
https://openalex.org/W4312084008,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases caused by pathologic misfolded tau protein aggregation in the nervous system. Population studies implicate EIF2AK3 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3), better known as PERK (protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase), as a genetic risk factor in several tauopathies. PERK is a key regulator of intracellular proteostatic mechanisms-unfolded protein response and integrated stress response. Previous studies found that tauopathy-associated PERK variants encoded functional hypomorphs with reduced signaling in vitro. But, it remained unclear how altered PERK activity led to tauopathy. Here, we chemically or genetically modulated PERK signaling in cell culture models of tau aggregation and found that PERK pathway activation prevented tau aggregation, whereas inhibition exacerbated tau aggregation. In primary tauopathy patient brain tissues, we found that reduced PERK signaling correlated with increased tau neuropathology. We found that tauopathy-associated PERK variants targeted the endoplasmic reticulum luminal domain; and two of these variants damaged hydrogen bond formation. Our studies support that PERK activity protects against tau aggregation and pathology. This may explain why people carrying hypomorphic PERK variants have increased risk for developing tauopathies. Finally, our studies identify small-molecule augmentation of PERK signaling as an attractive therapeutic strategy to treat tauopathies by preventing tau pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4312113972,"Abstract The tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is the most frequently mutated cancer gene in mesothelioma. Here we report novel functions for BAP1 in mitotic progression highlighting the relationship between BAP1 and control of genome stability in mesothelioma cells with therapeutic implications. Depletion of BAP1 protein induced proteasome-mediated degradation of BRCA1 in mesothelioma cells while loss of BAP1 correlated with BRCA1 loss in mesothelioma patient tumour samples. BAP1 loss also led to mitotic defects that phenocopied the loss of BRCA1 including spindle assembly checkpoint failure, centrosome amplification and chromosome segregation errors. However, loss of BAP1 also led to additional mitotic changes that were not observed upon BRCA1 loss, including an increase in spindle length and enhanced growth of astral microtubules. Intriguingly, these consequences could be explained by loss of expression of the KIF18A and KIF18B kinesin motors that occurred upon depletion of BAP1 but not BRCA1, as spindle and astral microtubule defects were rescued by re-expression of KIF18A and KIF18B, respectively. We therefore propose that BAP1 inactivation causes mitotic defects through BRCA1-dependent and independent mechanisms revealing novel routes by which mesothelioma cells lacking BAP1 may acquire genome instability and exhibit altered responses to microtubule-targeted agents."
https://openalex.org/W4312130149,"The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4312156810,"Under environmental stress, such as glucose deprivation, cells form stress granules-the accumulation of cytoplasmic aggregates of repressed translational initiation complexes, proteins, and stalled mRNAs. Recent research implicates stress granules in various diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, but the exact regulators responsible for the assembly and disassembly of stress granules are unknown. An important aspect of stress granule formation is the presence of posttranslational modifications on core proteins. One of those modifications is lysine acetylation, which is regulated by either a lysine acetyltransferase or a lysine deacetylase enzyme. This work deciphers the impact of lysine acetylation on an essential protein found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae stress granules, poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1). We demonstrated that an acetylation mimic of the lysine residue in position 131 reduces stress granule formation upon glucose deprivation and other stressors such as ethanol, raffinose, and vanillin. We present genetic evidence that the enzyme Rpd3 is the primary candidate for the deacetylation of Pab1-K131. Further, our electromobility shift assay studies suggest that the acetylation of Pab1-K131 negatively impacts poly(A) RNA binding. Due to the conserved nature of stress granules, therapeutics targeting the activity of lysine acetyltransferases and lysine deacetylase enzymes may be a promising route to modulate stress granule dynamics in the disease state."
https://openalex.org/W4312193325,"Drug safety initiatives have endorsed human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as an in vitro model for predicting drug-induced cardiac arrhythmia. However, the extent to which human-defined features of in vitro arrhythmia predict actual clinical risk has been much debated. Here, we trained a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN) to learn features of in vitro action potential recordings of hiPSC-CMs that are associated with lethal Torsade de Pointes arrhythmia. The CNN classifier accurately predicted the risk of drug-induced arrhythmia in people. The risk profile of the test drugs was similar across hiPSC-CMs derived from different healthy donors. In contrast, pathogenic mutations that cause arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies in patients significantly increased the proarrhythmic propensity to certain intermediate and high-risk drugs in the hiPSC-CMs. Thus, deep learning can identify in vitro arrhythmic features that correlate with clinical arrhythmia and discern the influence of patient genetics on the risk of drug-induced arrhythmia."
https://openalex.org/W4312207711,"Zinc plays essential roles in immune function and epithelial integrity. Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) often have low plasma zinc levels because of poor intake and diarrhea. We hypothesized that patients with zinc deficiency before HSCT had worse infectious complications after HSCT compared with patients with normal zinc levels. Citrulline, a marker of intestinal integrity, was also hypothesized to be lower in patients with zinc deficiency.Thirty patients undergoing HSCT at Ramathibodi Hospital during March 2020-September 2021 were enrolled. Blood samples for plasma zinc and citrulline were collected during the HSCT period. The 14- and 90-day outcomes after HSCT were prospectively recorded.Twelve of 30 (40%) patients had zinc deficiency before HSCT. Zinc-deficient patients were younger (median (interquartile range): 6 (8.8) vs 13 (5.8) years old; p = 0.017). Zinc levels tended to increase after admission in both groups. Patients with zinc deficiency had lower citrulline levels than those with normal zinc levels. Citrulline levels decreased in both groups after stem cell infusion, and the level was not significantly different between the two groups. Zinc-deficient patients had a higher rate of bacterial infection within 90 days after HSCT than those with normal zinc levels (6 in 12 patients (50.0%) vs 1 in 18 patients (5.6%); odds ratio [OR]: 17.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.68-171.70; p = 0.016). This remained significant after adjustments for age (adjusted OR: 12.31; 95% CI: 1.084-139.92; p = 0.043).The prevalence of zinc deficiency in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT was high. Zinc-deficient patients had lower citrulline levels and higher incidence of bacterial infection after HSCT. However, citrulline level was not different between patients with and without bacterial infections. It is worth to investigate whether zinc supplementation before HSCT can reduce bacterial infection after HSCT."
https://openalex.org/W4312207870,"The growing challenges of protecting biodiversity in agro-ecosystems and maintaining high agricultural productivity has become an important issue within the European Union, shaping both European and national agro-policies. The presented study is part of a broader evaluation of the interim targets of the 2013 Dutch policy plan on sustainable use of pesticides, carried out in 2019 by the PBL (Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving) Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of selected mitigation measures suggested in the policy plan on non-target terrestrial arthropods using a common carabid beetle Bembidion lampros as a model species. We combined dynamic landscape models with detailed agent-based population modelling to simulate impacts of reduction of toxicity of insecticides, reduction of spray drift to the off-crop area, and increase in area of field margins on the beetle population dynamics in ten agricultural landscapes representing different farming systems. Our simulations showed that a shift towards low-risk products should be the priority if the goal is to increase beetle range. To promote local beetle abundance this needs be coupled with increasing amount of field margins in a landscape. Overall, the observed treatment and landscape effects were highly context-specific and therefore we suggest that care is used when defining and interpretting metrics based on population effects of policy measures. This caveat notwithstanding, the use of simulation to assess complex interactions between landscape, ecology and behaviour of species, and policy measures can be a powerful tool supporting innovative policy management. This should include the development of landscape-context specific targets and/or mitigation measures."
https://openalex.org/W4312207962,"Can comics effectively convey scientific knowledge about COVID-19 to youth? What types and how many sources of information did youth have about COVID-19 during the pandemic? How are sources of information associated with accurate COVID-19 knowledge? To answer these questions, we surveyed youth in grades 5-9 in a Midwestern United States school district in the winter of 2020-2021. The online survey used measures of COVID-19 knowledge and sources, with an embedded experiment on COVID-19 relevant comics. Guided by an integrated science capital and just-in-time health and science information acquisition model, we also measured level of science capital, science identity, and utility of science for health and society. The school district protocol required parental consent for participation; 264 of ~15,000 youth participated. Youth were randomly assigned one of four comic conditions before receiving an online survey. Results indicate that, similar to knowledge gains in comic studies on other science topics, reading the comics was associated with 7 to 29% higher accuracy about COVID-19. We found that youth reported getting information about COVID-19 from between 0-6 sources including media, family, friends, school, and experts. The bivariate positive association of news versus other sources with accuracy of knowledge did not persist in the full model, yet the positive association of a higher number of sources and accuracy did persist in the multivariate models. The degree of valuing the utility of science for their health moderated the number of sources to accuracy association. Those with less value on science for health had a stronger positive association of number of sources and accuracy in COVID-19 knowledge. We conclude that during a pandemic, even with health and science information ubiquitous in the news media, increasing youth access to a variety of accurate sources of information about science and health can increase youth knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W4312213596,"Specific microRNAs expressions may accurately characterize different stages of canine myxomatous mitral valve disease. This preliminary pilot study aimed to (1) describe the clinical and echocardiographic parameters of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease at different American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) stages (B1, B2 and C) and healthy control group (ACVIM A), comparing the parameters collected during the first examination (T0) and the end of the follow-up (T1); (2) assess the association between the values of echocardiographic parameters at T1 and the expression profile of miR-30b-5p at T0. Thirty-five Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (median age 4.29 years and median weight 9 Kg) in different ACVIM stages were included (7 A, 19 B1, 6 B2 and 3 C). Inverse probability weighting analysis was performed to estimate the association of the exposure variable (miR-30b-5p) with the outcome variables (clinical and echocardiographic variables). Time was included as variable. The results pointed out that high levels of plasma miR-30b-5p corresponded to lower values of left ventricular end-diastolic diameter normalized for body weight, end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes indexed for body weight, and left atrium-to aortic root ratio. Hence, higher miR-30b-5p expressions were associated with milder forms of mitral valve disease in our study population. In contrast, the results obtained for the intensity of heart murmur, the mitral regurgitation severity, and the Mitral INsufficiency Echocardiographic score) were not statistically significant. A relationship between high abundance of miR-30b-5p and myxomatous mitral valve disease that appear echocardiographically more stable over time has been demonstrated. In conclusion, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels affected by myxomatous mitral valve disease that at the first cardiologic evaluation showed an upregulation of miR-30b-5p are expected to experience lesser variations on their echocardiographic examination between T0 and T1."

In this multi-isotopic analysis, we report new δ13C, δ15N and δ34S values for 251 faunal bone collagen samples from various archaeological contexts in Estonia representing the most comprehensive set of Iron Age, Medieval and Early Modern Period faunal stable isotope values to date. The results map out the local carbon and nitrogen baselines and define isotopic ranges of local terrestrial, avian and aquatic fauna. We also demonstrate the potential application of sulfur stable isotope analysis in archaeological research. The results demonstrate a clear distinction between δ13C and δ34S values of marine and terrestrial species, however, freshwater fish display notable overlaps with both marine and terrestrial ranges for both δ13C and δ34S values. Herbivores show variation in δ34S values when grouped by region, explained by differences in the local biotopes. This study is the first attempt to connect the Eastern Baltic isotopic baselines and provides more detailed temporal and geographical references to study the local ecologies and interpret the human data."

In COVID-19 patients, increased TNF-α concentration may provoke inflammatory cascade and induce the initiation of cytokine storm that may result in fatal pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS). Hence, TNFα is assumed to be a promising drug target against cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. In the present study, we focused on finding novel small molecules that can directly block TNF-α-hTNFR1 (human TNF receptor 1) interaction. In this regards, TNF-α-inhibiting capacity of natural carotenoids was investigated in terms of blocking TNF-α-hTNFR1 interaction in COVID-19 patients with the help of a combination of in silico approaches, based on virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A total of 125 carotenoids were selected out of 1204 natural molecules, based on their pharmacokinetics properties and they all met Lipinski’s rule of five. Among them, Sorgomol, Strigol and Orobanchol had the most favorable ΔG with the best ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties, and were selected for MD simulation studies, which explored the complex stability and the impact of ligands on protein conformation. Our results showed that Sorgomol formed the most hydrogen bonds, resulting in the highest binding energy with lowest RMSD and RMSF, which made it the most appropriate candidate as TNF-α inhibitor. In conclusion, the present study could serve to expand possibilities to develop new therapeutic small molecules against TNF-α."

As determined in our previous studies, trafficking of the predominant astrocyte GJ protein, Connexin43 (Cx43), is disrupted in response to infection with a neurotropic murine β-coronavirus (MHV-A59). However, how host factors are involved in Cx43 trafficking and the infection response is not clear. Here, we show that Cx43 retention due to MHV-A59 infection was associated with increased ER stress and reduced expression of chaperone protein ERp29. Treatment of MHV-A59-infected astrocytes with the chemical chaperone 4-sodium phenylbutyrate increased ERp29 expression, rescued Cx43 transport to the cell surface, increased GJIC, and reduced ER stress. We obtained similar results using an astrocytoma cell line (delayed brain tumor) upon MHV-A59 infection. Critically, delayed brain tumor cells transfected to express exogenous ERp29 were less susceptible to MHV-A59 infection and showed increased Cx43-mediated GJIC. Treatment with Cx43 mimetic peptides inhibited GJIC and increased viral susceptibility, demonstrating a role for intercellular communication in reducing MHV-A59 infectivity. Taken together, these results support a therapeutically targetable ERp29-dependent mechanism where β-coronavirus infectivity is modulated by reducing ER stress and rescuing Cx43 trafficking and function."
https://openalex.org/W4312114554,"Abstract The ability to compose new skills from a preacquired behavior repertoire is a hallmark of biological intelligence. Although artificial agents extract reusable skills from past experience and recombine them in a hierarchical manner, whether the brain similarly composes a novel behavior is largely unknown. In the present study, I show that deep reinforcement learning agents learn to solve a novel composite task by additively combining representations of prelearned action values of constituent subtasks. Learning efficacy in the composite task was further augmented by the introduction of stochasticity in behavior during pretraining. These theoretical predictions were empirically tested in mice, where subtask pretraining enhanced learning of the composite task. Cortex-wide, two-photon calcium imaging revealed analogous neural representations of combined action values, with improved learning when the behavior variability was amplified. Together, these results suggest that the brain composes a novel behavior with a simple arithmetic operation of preacquired action-value representations with stochastic policies."
https://openalex.org/W4312141248,"The prion protein (PrPC) is subjected to several conserved endoproteolytic events producing bioactive fragments that are of increasing interest for their physiological functions and their implication in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, systematic and comprehensive investigations on the full spectrum of PrPC proteoforms have been hampered by the lack of methods able to identify all PrPC-derived proteoforms. Building on previous knowledge of PrPC endoproteolytic processing, we thus developed an optimized Western blot assay able to obtain the maximum information about PrPC constitutive processing and the relative abundance of PrPC proteoforms in a complex biological sample. This approach led to the concurrent identification of the whole spectrum of known endoproteolytic-derived PrPC proteoforms in brain homogenates, including C-terminal, N-terminal and, most importantly, shed PrPC-derived fragments. Endoproteolytic processing of PrPC was remarkably similar in the brain of widely used wild type and transgenic rodent models, with α-cleavage-derived C1 representing the most abundant proteoform and ADAM10-mediated shedding being an unexpectedly prominent proteolytic event. Interestingly, the relative amount of shed PrPC was higher in WT mice than in most other models. Our results indicate that constitutive endoproteolytic processing of PrPC is not affected by PrPC overexpression or host factors other than PrPC but can be impacted by PrPC primary structure. Finally, this method represents a crucial step in gaining insight into pathophysiological roles, biomarker suitability, and therapeutic potential of shed PrPC and for a comprehensive appraisal of PrPC proteoforms in therapies, drug screening, or in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases."

Here, we show that the lncRNA HITT (HIF-1α inhibitor at translation level) can specifically localize in mitochondria. Cells expressing higher levels of HITT contain fragmented mitochondria. Conversely, we show that HITT knockdown cells have more tubular mitochondria than is present in control cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrate HITT directly binds mitofusin-2 (MFN2), a core component that mediates mitochondrial outer membrane fusion, by the in vitro RNA pull-down and UV-cross-linking RNA-IP assays. In doing so, we found HITT disturbs MFN2 homotypic or heterotypic complex formation, attenuating mitochondrial fusion. Under stress conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation, we in addition show HITT stability increases as a consequence of MiR-205 downregulation, inhibiting MFN2-mediated fusion and leading to apoptosis.

MFN1/2 functions by forming homotypic or heterotypic complexes at two closely adjacent mitochondria that subsequently link them together to initiate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion, while OPA1 mediates fusion of inner membranes (5Gao S.

Genetic mutations in MFN2 suppress mitochondrial fusion and cause Charcot Marie Tooth Disease 2A and also cause the neurodegenerative disease (6Züchner S. Mersiyanova I.V. Muglia M.

Mitochondrial dynamics in adaptive and maladaptive cellular stress responses.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). For example, cells subjected to UV radiation or general inhibition of protein or mRNA synthesis have elongated mitochondria, which is driven by increased fusion and has been termed stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (9Tondera D. Grandemange S. Jourdain A. Karbowski M. Mattenberger Y. Herzig S. et al.SLP-2 is required for stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). This event is essential for energy production and stress adaptation (8Eisner V. Picard M. Mitochondrial dynamics in adaptive and maladaptive cellular stress responses.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Cells defective in mitochondrial fusion are vulnerable to stress-induced apoptosis (10Youle R.J. van der Bliek A.M.

It has also been shown that mitochondrial elongation and subsequent adaptation occur in response to stresses such as serum (12Gomes L.C. Di Benedetto G. Scorrano L.

Essential amino acids and glutamine regulate induction of mitochondrial elongation during autophagy.Cell Cycle (Georgetown, Tex.). 2011; 10: 2635-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unlike hyperfusion, this is caused by decreased fission. However, although it is clear that mitochondrial fusion and fission are fundamental for mitochondrial functioning, the regulatory mechanisms underlying mitochondrial dynamics are not well understood. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA transcripts longer than 200 nt in length with no protein-coding potential (16Kopp F. Mendell J.T. Functional classification and experimental dissection of long noncoding RNAs.Cell. 2018; 172: 393-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). LncRNA genes, like many other noncoding genes, were once regarded as ‘genomic junk’ (17Palazzo A.F. Koonin E.V. Functional long non-coding RNAs evolve from junk transcripts.Cell. 2020; 183: 1151-1161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, over the past decade, it has been shown that lncRNAs are widely expressed and involved in almost every aspect of biological processes such as cell migration, metabolism, cell death, and differentiation (18Yao R.W. Wang Y. Chen L.L. Cell functions long noncoding RNAs.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 19Statello L. Guo C.J. Chen L.L.

The functions and unique features of long intergenic non-coding RNA.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The altered expression of lncRNAs is strongly associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer (21Anastasiadou E. Jacob L.S. Slack F.J. Non-coding RNA networks in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2018; 18: 5-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 22Slack F.J. Chinnaiyan A.M. The role of non-coding RNAs in oncology.Cell. 2019; 179: 1033-1055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). LncRNAs can elicit either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive functions through specific interactions with DNA, RNA, or proteins at particular subcellular localizations (16Kopp F. Mendell J.T. Functional classification and experimental dissection of long noncoding RNAs.Cell. 2018; 172: 393-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 18Yao R.W. Wang Y. Chen L.L. Cell functions long noncoding RNAs.Nat. Cell Biol. 2019; 21: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the development of fractionation-based techniques has shown that, in addition to their overall distribution in the nucleus or cytoplasm, organelle-specific lncRNAs exist in mitochondria (23Sang L. Ju H.Q. Mitochondrial long non-coding RNA GAS5 tunes TCA metabolism in response to nutrient stress.Nat. Metab. 2021; 3: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (24Fazal F.M. Han S. Parker K.R. Kaewsapsak P. Xu J. Boettiger A.N. et al.Atlas of subcellular RNA localization revealed by APEX-seq.Cell. 2019; 178: 473-490.e426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and nuclear paraspeckles (25Yamazaki T. Souquere S. Chujo T. Kobelke S. Chong Y.S. Fox A.H. et al.Functional domains of NEAT1 architectural lncRNA induce paraspeckle assembly through phase separation.Mol. Cell. 2018; 70: 1038-1053.e1037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, only a small proportion of organelle-associated lncRNAs have been fully validated or functionally characterized to date. Recently, we characterized an lncRNA called HITT (HIF-1α inhibitor at translation level; also known as LINC00637). Decreased HITT expression are seen in multiple types of cancer and are associated with poor outcomes of patients, including colon and lung cancers. HITT can localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm (26Wang X. Li L. Zhao K. Lin Q. Li H. Xue X. et al.A novel LncRNA HITT forms a regulatory loop with HIF-1α to modulate angiogenesis and tumor growth.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1431-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, it binds to the translational regulator Y box–binding protein 1 and prevents it from binding to its target, HIF-1α mRNA, resulting in decreased HIF-1α translation (26Wang X. Li L. Zhao K. Lin Q. Li H. Xue X. et al.A novel LncRNA HITT forms a regulatory loop with HIF-1α to modulate angiogenesis and tumor growth.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1431-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, HITT expression is repressed by HIF-1α–regulated MiR-205 expression, which is required for efficient HIF-1α mRNA translation and subsequent adaptive survival under hypoxia (26Wang X. Li L. Zhao K. Lin Q. Li H. Xue X. et al.A novel LncRNA HITT forms a regulatory loop with HIF-1α to modulate angiogenesis and tumor growth.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1431-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Wang X. Wang Y. Li L. Xue X. Xie H. Shi H. et al.A lncRNA coordinates with Ezh2 to inhibit HIF-1α transcription and suppress cancer cell adaption to hypoxia.Oncogene. 2020; 39: 1860-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, in response to chemotherapeutic drug-induced double-strand breaks, HITT is transcriptionally activated and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and attenuates the DNA damage-repair process by inhibiting the recruitment and activation of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated at sites of DNA breakage (28Zhao K. Wang X. Xue X. Li L. Hu Y. A long noncoding RNA sensitizes genotoxic treatment by attenuating ATM activation and homologous recombination repair in cancers.PLoS Biol. 2020; 18e3000666Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings highlight the fact that lncRNA HITT can response to multiple stresses and that its subcellular localization dictates its specific biological functions. Here, we report further analysis of the precise localization of HITT in the cytoplasm and the unexpected finding that HITT can localize to mitochondria. Our studies have revealed that HITT directly interacts with MFN2 and increases mitochondrial fragmentation by preventing MFN2 homotypic or heterotypic complex–mediated mitochondrial fusion, thus sensitizing cancer cells to UV-induced cell death. HITT was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, further fractionation and immunofluorescence revealed it was also localized in the mitochondria (Figs. 1, A and B and S1A). Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial markers (Histon3.1, α-tubulin, HSP60) were detected in Fig. S1B. This finding motivated us to investigate whether HITT influences mitochondrial morphology, which is vital to cell fate. To explore this, we first defined mitochondrial morphologies as fragmented, short, or reticular, as exemplified in Fig. S1C. The efficiencies of HITT overexpression or siRNA-mediated HITT knockdown (KD) were confirmed by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay (Fig. 1, C and D). As indicated by heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) staining, mitochondria were distributed mainly at perinuclear regions in both HeLa and A549 cells, regardless of HITT levels (Fig. 1, E–J). Intriguingly, mitochondria were shortened with small ‘dotty’ morphology in HITT-overexpressing HeLa and A549 (Fig. 1, E and F), while the proportion of reticular mitochondria was significantly reduced (Fig. 1, E and F). This was validated by images captured by scanning electronic microscopy (Fig. S1D). In contrast, HITT KD by si-RNA or CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in connected, long tubular mitochondria in HeLa and A549 cell lines (Figs. 1, G, H, S1, E and F). Restoring HITT expression counteracted the altered mitochondrial morphology caused by HITT KD (Figs. 1, G, H, S1, E and F). Upon short-term mild exposure to stress, such as UV irradiation or treatment with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide or transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D, mitochondrial morphology is changed, mainly due to increased mitochondrial fusion, as suggested by previous reports (9Tondera D. Grandemange S. Jourdain A. Karbowski M. Mattenberger Y. Herzig S. et al.SLP-2 is required for stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion.EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, HITT overexpression completely abolished the effects of such stresses on mitochondrial morphology (Figs. 1, I, J and S1, G–J). Therefore, HITT plays a role in regulating mitochondrial morphology under both basal and stressed conditions. We further asked how HITT regulates mitochondrial morphology. The mitochondria-shaping proteins, MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, are required for mitochondria fusion. HITT did not affect the expression of MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1. As expected, KD of MFN1, MFN2, or OPA1 resulted in fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and B). Intriguingly, inhibition of HITT expression did not reverse MFN2 KD-induced mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, HITT KD led to an elongated mitochondrial phenotype regardless of MFN1 KD or OPA1 KD. MFN2 overexpression resulted in reticular mitochondria. Intriguingly, MFN2 overexpression rescues HITT-induced mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. S2A). After downregulating MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, the expression of HITT remained unchanged (Fig. S2B). These data suggest that HITT acts mainly through interfering with the activity of MFN2. Next, we investigated how HITT influences MFN2 activity, which was unlikely to be by changing the levels of MFN2 expression (Fig. S2C). As homotypic or heterotypic complex formation is required for MFN2-mediated mitochondrial fusion, we reasoned that HITT may influence MFN2 homodimerization or its binding with MFN1. Intriguingly, an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay revealed that HITT overexpression reduced coprecipitation of MFN1 with anti-MFN2 precipitates from both HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. S2D). HITT also inhibits the binding of exogenous MFN1 and MFN2 (Fig. S2E). Dose-dependent inhibition was further revealed in transfected HeLa cells with increasing levels of HITT (Fig. 2C). In contrast, amounts of MFN1/MFN2 complex were elevated by siRNA-mediated HITT inhibition (Fig. 2D) and were also increased following 3 h UV treatment (Fig. S2F), which was in line with immunofluorescence results that showed that mitochondrial fusion was induced 3 h after UV exposure (Fig. S2F). Intriguingly, HITT overexpression suppressed UV-induced complex formation (Fig. S2F). Therefore, HITT inhibits the formation of MFN1/MFN2 heterotypic complexes. The next question was whether HITT influences MFN2 homodimerization. To answer this, we generated two tagged MFN2 constructs, one with Flag and another with HA. Both constructs were simultaneously introduced into HeLa cells. Anti-HA IP assay revealed that levels of coprecipitated Flag-MFN2 were significantly lower in HITT-overexpressing cells than control cells (Fig. 2E). By contrast, HITT overexpression had little effect on MFN1 homotypic complexes (Fig. S2G). Furthermore, after cross-linking, two MFN2-containing complexes were detected under native conditions. Levels of MFN2 homodimers or heterodimers, a 200-kDa band, were much lower, while MFN2 monomers, a 100-kDa band, were higher in HITT-overexpressing HeLa cells than controls (Fig. 2F). The 200-kDa band was also detectable by the anti-MFN1 antibody (Fig. S2H), further suggesting that this 200-kDa band may represent both MFN2 homodimers and heterodimers. Thus, HITT inhibits MFN2 homodimerization or heterodimerization in cancer cells. LncRNAs can exert their functions through RNA–protein interactions. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying HITT-mediated MFN2 polymerization, we performed biotinylated RNA pull-down assays to identify potential HITT-binding proteins in HeLa cells. As shown, we found that sense HITT, but not an antisense control, specifically interacted with MFN1 and MFN2 (Fig. 3A). Neither sense nor antisense HITT bound OPA1 and dynamin-related protein 1. Direct interaction between MFN2/HITT was further validated by an in vitro–binding assay using in vitro–synthesized HITT and purified MFN2 and MFN1 proteins (Fig. 3B). Physical and specific interaction between MFN2 and HITT was also demonstrated in living cells via a UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 3C). In addition, MFN2/HITT interaction was increased by HITT overexpression and decreased by HITT KD (Fig. 3, D and E). Furthermore, MFN2/HITT complex formation increased 3 h after UV exposure (Fig. 3F). Given the physical and specific interaction between HITT/MFN2, we further explored the mechanisms underlying their interaction. To this end, HITT and fragmented HITT mutants were introduced into 4T1 cells, which do not endogenously express HITT. Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assay of MFN2 showed that levels of MFN2’s binding with full-length HITT and Fragment 3 (F3; 1030 − 2050 nt) were similar, while binding to HITT fragments F1 and F2 was completely abolished (Fig. 4A). The key residues in MFN2 that mediated the binding of HITT were mapped to mutant 4 (M4) MFN2 (651 − 754 aa), a region-mediated oligomerization (29Koshiba T. Detmer S.A. Kaiser J.T. Chen H. McCaffery J.M. Chan D.C. Structural basis of mitochondrial tethering by mitofusin complexes.Science (New York, N.Y.). 2004; 305: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). In line with our biochemical analysis, full-length and F3 HITT, but not F1 and F2, were able to localize at mitochondria and prevent complex formation between MFN1/MFN2 and mitochondrial fusion (Figs. S3, 4, C and D). Because HITT regulates the UV-induced hyperfusion, we asked whether HITT levels change with stress. Intriguingly, HITT levels were induced and MFN2 was not changed by UV irradiation in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 5A and S4A). However, HITT promoter-driven luciferase reporter activity was unchanged with treatment (Fig. S4B), suggesting that the increased levels of HITT may be due to reduced RNA stability. miRNAs play essential roles in suppressing expression of mRNAs and lncRNAs. Therefore, we reasoned that HITT may be regulated by miRNA. Based on our previous data, four miRNAs (MiR-7, MiR-20, MiR-106, and MiR-205) were experimentally validated for inhibition of HITT expression following bioinformatic-prediction (26Wang X. Li L. Zhao K. Lin Q. Li H. Xue X. et al.A novel LncRNA HITT forms a regulatory loop with HIF-1α to modulate angiogenesis and tumor growth.Cell Death Differ. 2020; 27: 1431-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, MiR-205 was the only miRNA that had dramatically reduced expression following UV irradiation (Fig. S4C). Further dose-dependent analysis revealed that MiR-205 expression was gradually reduced with increasing doses of UV treatment (Fig. 5B), and this was inversely associated with increased HITT expression in UV-treated cells. Additionally, levels of HITT and MiR-205 were found to be negatively associated with each other in human cervical cancer tissues by analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database (Fig. 5C). Moreover, recovery of MiR-205 expression abolished UV-induced HITT expression (Fig. 5, D and E) and also accelerated the rate of HITT degradation (Fig. 5F). By contrast, in the same set of experiments, the control RNA, GAPDH mRNA, expression was unchanged with UV treatment or MiR-205 expression (Fig. 5G). MiR-205–overexpressing resulted in connected, long tubular mitochondria, whereas KD miR-205 was the opposite. Notably, neither overexpression nor KD MiR-205 affected the expression of MFN2 (Fig. S4, D–F). Overexpression of HITT abolished the effect MiR-205–induced mitochondrial fusion, while downregulation of MFN1/2 abrogated the effect of HITT/MiR-205 (Fig. S4F). Accordingly, overexpression of MiR-205 inhibited the formation of the MFN2-HITT complex and promoted the formation of the MFN1–MFN2 complex (Fig. S4, G–H). In addition, overexpression of HITT abolished the effect of MiR-205 on MFN1/MFN2 complex formation (Fig. S4G). These data collectively suggest that MiR-205 regulates MFN1/2/HITT complex formation by inhibiting HITT levels. It has been proposed previously that mitochondria elongation under stress is essential for the adaptive survival of cancer cells (12Gomes L.C. Di Benedetto G. Scorrano L. During autophagy mitochondria elongate, are spared from degradation and sustain cell viability.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 30Li J. Huang Q. Long X. Guo X. Sun X. Jin X. et al.Mitochondrial elongation-mediated glucose metabolism reprogramming is essential for tumour cell survival during energy stress.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 4901-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the HITT in regulating adaptive survival to UV exposure via crystal violet staining assays, we constructed a model of adaptive survival to the death of UV-treated cells. We treated the cells with 40 mJ/cm2 UV and allowed the cells to recover for 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h to examine mitochondrial morphology and cell survival. We found that the mitochondrial morphology first became reticular, and then the mitochondria gradually fragmented over time (Fig. S5A). There was no obvious change in cell survival in the early stage, while the cell survival rate decreased in the late stage (Fig. S5D). Importantly, MFN2 expression was not changed in the early stage and slightly decreased in the late stage (Fig. S5B) and the expression of HITT was consistently elevated at the early stage and slightly decreased in the late stage (Fig. S5C), suggesting that HITT may be involved in this process. To demonstrate this, KD HITT was used to validate its effects on cell survival in this model. The results showed that downregulation of HITT prolonged the time of cell adaptive survival (Fig. S5D). We investigated the role of the MiR-205/HITT/MFN2 axis in regulating survival to UV exposure via MTT (3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phhenytetrazoliumromide) and crystal violet staining assays. HITT KD decreased UV-induced cell death and the effect was largely diminished by MFN2 KD in both HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Inhibition of MiR-205, an upstream regulator of HITT, led to increased HITT expression and increased the number of cells that underwent UV-induced cell death (Fig. 6, C and D). HITT expression abolished the anti-cell death effect of HITT KD under the UV treatment (Fig. S5E). These data collectively suggest that the MiR-205/HITT/MFN2 axis plays essential roles in regulating UV-induced cell death. We also found that MiR-205/HITT/MFN2 axis-regulated cell death results from increased apoptotic sensitivity. Annexin V staining and cleaved caspase 3/7 assays showed that the apoptotic rates of HeLa and A549 cells were increased following UV treatment and were decreased by HITT KD. HITT-promoted and UV-induced apoptosis was compromised by MFN2 KD and strengthened by MiR-205 inhibition (Fig. 6, E–H). Therefore, the MiR-205/HITT/MFN2 axis plays essential roles in regulating UV-induced apoptosis. The discovery and characterization of lncRNAs has increased our understanding of diverse cellular processes (31Batista P.J. Chang H.Y. Long noncoding RNAs: Cellular address codes in development and disease.Cell. 2013; 152: 1298-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). However, whether lncRNAs affect mitochondria fusion remains poorly understood. Here, we report lncRNA HITT specifically interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MFN2 and regulates mitochondrial fusion by disrupting MFN2 interaction with itself or MFN1. In addition, we suggest a model for how lncRNA HITT regulates mitochondrial dynamics in response to stress and confers sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis. The connection between lncRNAs and mitochondrial dynamics has been suggested in previous studies (32Tian T. Lv X. Pan G. Lu Y. Chen W.

Commun. 2014; 5: 3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The lncRNA Malat1 has been shown to promote fusion via the MiR-26b/MFN1 axis (34Chen Y. Li S. Zhang Y. Wang M. Li X.

Acids. 2018; 10: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, HITT is the first mitochondrial lncRNA to date to be identified as a regulator of mitochondrial fusion. Organelle-specific lncRNAs have gained a lot of attention in recent years (23Sang L. Ju H.Q. Mitochondrial long non-coding RNA GAS5 tunes TCA metabolism in response to nutrient stress.Nat. Metab. 2021; 3: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like proteins, the functions of lncRNAs are closely correlated with their subcellular localizations, because their functions are directed by local molecular interactions (36Bridges M.C. Daulagala A.C. Kourtidis A. LNCcation: lncRNA localization and function.J. Cell Biol. 2021; 220e202009045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, lncRNAs modulate transcriptional programs through chromatin interactions in the nucleus and mediate signal transduction pathways, translational programs, and posttranscriptional control of gene expression in the cytoplasm (18Yao R.W.

https://openalex.org/W4312207712,"Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker for diagnosing infections and guiding antibiotic therapy. In this study, we investigated whether PCT can predict survival and recovery at 28 days in critically ill patients with sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SIAKI) receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). We examined 649 patients with SIAKI who underwent CRRT in our intensive care unit. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, a single PCT level at CRRT initiation was not associated with survival in all patients. However, the higher % PCT decrease over 72 hours after CRRT initiation was independently associated with the higher chance of 28-day survival (per 10% decrease, hazard ratio [HR] for mortality: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.89; P < 0.001). Among the survivors, the % PCT decrease over 72 hours after CRRT initiation, not a single PCT level at CRRT initiation, was independently associated with recovery from dialysis (per 10% decrease, HR for renal recovery: 1.28, 95% CI:1.21-1.36; P < 0.001). This study demonstrated that the higher % PCT decrease was independently associated with the higher chance of survival and recovery from dialysis at 28 days in critically ill patients with SIAKI receiving CRRT. Thus, a decrease in the PCT level, not a single PCT level at CRRT initiation, could be a valuable tool for predicting prognosis in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4312207857,"The consideration of an existing stochastic approach for the reproduction of ranked data pointed at a formal equivalence between its key mathematical expression and that for trajectories at the tangent bifurcation. This fact led to a nonlinear dynamical approach for rank distributions that shows similarities with universality classes in critical phenomena. The renormalization group (RG) fixed-point map f *( x ) for a tangent bifurcation of arbitrary nonlinearity z &gt; 1 has proved to be a powerful tool into which the formalism can be couched. The source distribution P ( N ) of the stochastic approach can be linked to f *( x ) while the size-rank N ( k ) and frequency-rank F ( k ′) distributions are obtained, respectively, from the map trajectories x t and the sums of its positions. We provide now an extension to Number Theory as we obtain from the trajectories x t of f *( x ) the numbers, or asymptotic approximations of them, for the Factorial, Natural, Prime and Fibonacci sets. A measure of the advance of these numbers towards infinity is given by sums of positions that represent their reciprocals. We specify rank distribution universality classes, already associated with real data, to these number sets. We find that the convergence of the series of number reciprocals occurs first at nonlinearity z = 2, that which corresponds to the classical Zipf law, and link this transition edge to the action of the attractor when it first reduces the fractal dimension of trajectory positions to zero. Furthermore, the search of logarithmic corrections common to borderline dimensions provides a link to the Prime numbers set. Finally, we find corroborating evidence of these logarithmic corrections from the analysis of large data sets for ranked earthquake magnitudes. The formalism links all types of ranked distributions to a generalized extensive entropy."

We consider four experimental policy conditions: a baseline situation, a framing condition in which drivers are suggested that driving fast violates a social norm, and two punishment conditions, one exogenous and one endogenous. We find that the most effective policies use different framing and endogenously determined punishment mechanisms (to fast drivers by other drivers). These policies are only effective for female drivers which leads to substantial gender payoff differences. Our data suggest that these results arise from differences in social norms across genders, thus opening the way to designing more effective policies."

To apply this concept to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) care and lay the foundation for network interventions to disseminate high-quality treatment, we assessed the need for improving the IBD practices of highly connected clinicians. We aimed to examine whether highly connected clinicians who treat IBD patients were more likely to provide high-quality treatment than less connected clinicians.We used network analysis to examine connections among clinicians who shared patients with IBD in the Veterans Health Administration between 2015-2018. We created a network comprised of clinicians connected by shared patients. We quantified clinician connections using degree centrality (number of clinicians with whom a clinician shares patients), closeness centrality (reach via shared contacts to other clinicians), and betweenness centrality (degree to which a clinician connects clinicians not otherwise connected). Using weighted linear regression, we examined associations between each measure of connection and two IBD quality indicators: low prolonged steroids use, and high steroid-sparing therapy use.We identified 62,971 patients with IBD and linked them to 1,655 gastroenterologists and 7,852 primary care providers. Clinicians with more connections (degree) were more likely to exhibit high-quality treatment (less prolonged steroids beta -0.0268, 95%CI -0.0427, -0.0110, more steroid-sparing therapy beta 0.0967, 95%CI 0.0128, 0.1805). Clinicians who connect otherwise unconnected clinicians (betweenness) displayed more prolonged steroids use (beta 0.0003, 95%CI 0.0001, 0.0006). The presence of variation is more relevant than its magnitude.Clinicians with a high number of connections provided more high-quality IBD treatments than less connected clinicians, and may be well-positioned for interventions to disseminate high-quality IBD care. However, clinicians who connect clinicians who are otherwise unconnected are more likely to display low-quality IBD treatment. Efforts to improve their quality are needed prior to leveraging their position to disseminate high-quality care."

Since many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic diseases, are caused by protein misfolding, drugs that inhibit Hsp90 are being pursued as potential targets for treatments. In the recent JBC Editor's Pick by Donahue et al., the authors show that diptoindonesin G is a new Hsp90 inhibitor that promotes degradation of the estrogen receptor, an Hsp90 client, without inducing the heat shock response."

A flurry of near-atomic models of the multiprotein complexes that make up IFT trains has revealed new conformational changes, which may underlie the switch between anterograde and retrograde intraflagellar transport."
