https://openalex.org/W3104014715,"Kidney fibrosis is the hallmark of chronic kidney disease progression; however, at present no antifibrotic therapies exist1-3. The origin, functional heterogeneity and regulation of scar-forming cells that occur during human kidney fibrosis remain poorly understood1,2,4. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled the transcriptomes of cells from the proximal and non-proximal tubules of healthy and fibrotic human kidneys to map the entire human kidney. This analysis enabled us to map all matrix-producing cells at high resolution, and to identify distinct subpopulations of pericytes and fibroblasts as the main cellular sources of scar-forming myofibroblasts during human kidney fibrosis. We used genetic fate-tracing, time-course single-cell RNA sequencing and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) experiments in mice, and spatial transcriptomics in human kidney fibrosis, to shed light on the cellular origins and differentiation of human kidney myofibroblasts and their precursors at high resolution. Finally, we used this strategy to detect potential therapeutic targets, and identified NKD2 as a myofibroblast-specific target in human kidney fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3104471981,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Africa is poorly described. The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya was reported on 12 March 2020, and an overwhelming number of cases and deaths were expected, but by 31 July 2020, there were only 20,636 cases and 341 deaths. However, the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the community remains unknown. We determined the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G among blood donors in Kenya in April-June 2020. Crude seroprevalence was 5.6% (174 of 3098). Population-weighted, test-performance-adjusted national seroprevalence was 4.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.9 to 5.8%) and was highest in urban counties Mombasa (8.0%), Nairobi (7.3%), and Kisumu (5.5%). SARS-CoV-2 exposure is more extensive than indicated by case-based surveillance, and these results will help guide the pandemic response in Kenya and across Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3042072141,"Whole-genome sequencing projects are increasingly populating the tree of life and characterizing biodiversity1-4. Sparse taxon sampling has previously been proposed to confound phylogenetic inference5, and captures only a fraction of the genomic diversity. Here we report a substantial step towards the dense representation of avian phylogenetic and molecular diversity, by analysing 363 genomes from 92.4% of bird families-including 267 newly sequenced genomes produced for phase II of the Bird 10,000 Genomes (B10K) Project. We use this comparative genome dataset in combination with a pipeline that leverages a reference-free whole-genome alignment to identify orthologous regions in greater numbers than has previously been possible and to recognize genomic novelties in particular bird lineages. The densely sampled alignment provides a single-base-pair map of selection, has more than doubled the fraction of bases that are confidently predicted to be under conservation and reveals extensive patterns of weak selection in predominantly non-coding DNA. Our results demonstrate that increasing the diversity of genomes used in comparative studies can reveal more shared and lineage-specific variation, and improve the investigation of genomic characteristics. We anticipate that this genomic resource will offer new perspectives on evolutionary processes in cross-species comparative analyses and assist in efforts to conserve species."

Here we provide genome assemblies for 131 species, of which all but 9 are previously uncharacterized, and describe a whole-genome alignment of 240 species of considerable phylogenetic diversity, comprising representatives from more than 80% of mammalian families. We find that regions of reduced genetic diversity are more abundant in species at a high risk of extinction, discern signals of evolutionary selection at high resolution and provide insights from individual reference genomes. By prioritizing phylogenetic diversity and making data available quickly and without restriction, the Zoonomia Project aims to support biological discovery, medical research and the conservation of biodiversity."

Although embryonic organoids have been shown to mimic many of the morphological and transcriptional hallmarks of the early embryo, their potential to undergo organogenesis has not yet been explored. The heart is the first organ to form and function in the embryo. Short after gastrulation, heart progenitors are specified, progressively localize anteriorly, and organize in a crescent-shaped domain (by embryonic day 7.5 [E7.5]), the first cardiac compartment that is morphologically identifiable during development. Cardiogenesis is based on the interaction of two different types of progenitors, namely the first heart field (FHF) and the second heart field (SHF) progenitors, the latter originating from pharyngeal mesoderm (Kelly et al., 2014Kelly R.G. Buckingham M.E. Moorman A.F. Heart fields and cardiac morphogenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2014; 4: a015750Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The cardiac crescent, mainly formed by FHF progenitors, subsequently rearranges to form a linear heart tube (around E8.0–E8.5), which is the first beating structure. Successively, SHF progenitors contribute to heart tube elongation and the heart undergoes looping, ballooning, and septation, giving rise to the four-chambered structure typical of adulthood (Harvey, 2002Harvey R.P. Patterning the vertebrate heart.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 544-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Heart organogenesis requires cardiac progenitors to interact with surrounding tissues through mechanical interactions and the secretion of cardiac-inducing factors (Miquerol and Kelly, 2013Miquerol L.

We hypothesized that, due to their embryo-like multi-axial organization and gene expression patterns, mouse gastruloids (Beccari et al., 2018Beccari L. Moris N. Girgin M. Turner D.A.

Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal somitogenesis in gastruloids.Nature. 2020; 582: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) could offer a suitable template for modeling early heart development because they potentially preserve the crucial tissue-tissue interactions required for this organogenesis. Indeed, studying heart organogenesis in such a complex and spatially organized system could allow the modeling of developmental events in an embryo-like context, where cardiac cells are naturally exposed to the influence of other tissues. Here, we show that self-organizing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can capture early heart organogenesis in vitro with a surprising temporal and spatial accuracy. Exposing small ESC aggregates to a cocktail of three cardiogenic factors in gastruloid culture conditions promotes cardiac development in vitro starting from Mesp1+ progenitors, which progressively become restricted to the anterior portion of the gastruloid. Through a combination of light-sheet and confocal microscopy, RNAscope imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that these embryoids support the formation of Flk1+ cardiovascular progenitors, the generation of a vascular-like network, and the formation of progenitors with first and second heart field identities. Strikingly, we find evidence for the morphogenesis of an anterior cardiac crescent-like domain, which subsequently gives rise to a beating compartment exhibiting Ca2+-handling properties comparable to functional fetal cardiomyocytes. Morphogenesis is established in close spatial proximity to the most anterior portion of a co-developing gut-tube-like structure, which is separated from the cardiac domain by an endocardial-like layer. Therefore, this in vitro model of cardiac organogenesis uniquely captures interactions between embryonic tissues in the context of a spatially organized embryo-like entity. Gastruloids occasionally formed a beating domain that is exclusively located within their anterior region (38.5% ± 29.3% formed at 168 h) when cultured for 144 h or longer in N2B27 medium (Figure 1A). The location and activity of this beating structure suggested that it might correspond to a cardiac primordium. We tested whether well-known cardiogenic factors (Rajala et al., 2011Rajala K. Pekkanen-Mattila M. Aalto-Setälä K. Cardiac differentiation of pluripotent stem cells.Stem Cells Int. 2011; 2011: 383709Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) could increase the frequency of this event by adding basic fibroblast growth factor, ascorbic acid, and vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF) (Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J. Huber T.L. Keller G.M. Multipotent flk-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells give rise to the cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), singly or in combination, and we increased nutrient and growth factor availability through volume optimization and shaking (Figures 1A and S1A). In these culture conditions (termed N2B27+++), the frequency of beating gastruloids increased by more than a factor of two (87.2% ± 15.6% formed at 168 h; Figures 1A and 1B; Video S1). We noticed that exposure to cardiogenic factors was most effective when applied in combination and between 96 and 144 h (Figures S1A–S1H), so we kept this protocol for the following experiments. Importantly, culturing in N2B27+++ did not alter the polarization of the gastruloids, the extent of their elongation (Figures S1I and S1J), or the timing of the emergence of the beating domains (Figures 1A and S1B–S1D) compared to standard conditions. Staining for Gata4 and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) confirmed that the beating structure was cardiac like (Figure 1C). FACS analysis of reporter-cell-derived gastruloids at different time points showed that gastruloids grown in N2B27 or N2B27+++ conditions were characterized by similar levels of cardiac progenitor markers (Gata6 and Flk1; Figures S1K and S1L). However, at 168 h in N2B27+++, there was an increase of expression of markers distinguishing the first and second heart fields (Hcn4 and Tbx1; Figures S1M and S1N). This is in keeping with previous literature showing that the three cardiogenic factors can induce cardiac differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J. Huber T.L.

Example of a Non-beating Gastruloid Cultured in N2B27 and a Beating Gastruloid Cultured in N2B27+++, Related to Figure 1 To characterize our embryonic organoid system at the single-cell level, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of gastruloids every 24 h from 96 h to 168 h. Unsupervised clustering identified 59 clusters, which were assigned to 32 cell types based on canonical markers (Table S1). Our analysis revealed the presence of a multitude of cell types (Figures 1D and 1E), in line with the embryo-like organization of gastruloids (Beccari et al., 2018Beccari L. Moris N. Girgin M.

Cells differentiated from an epiblast-like stage into three main branches, corresponding to the three germ layer derivatives (Figures 1D and 1F). Interestingly, some cross-talk between germ layers was also identified, such as the contribution of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) to both mesodermal and neural lineages. We also detected cells with presomitic and somitic identity (van den Brink et al., 2020van den Brink S.C. Alemany A. van Batenburg V. Moris N. Blotenburg M. Vivié J. Baillie-Johnson P. Nichols J.

Overall, we observed a broader variety of differentiating cell types compared to a recently published scRNA-seq analysis of mouse gastruloids (van den Brink et al., 2020van den Brink S.C. Alemany A. van Batenburg V. Moris N. Blotenburg M. Vivié J. Baillie-Johnson P. Nichols J. Sonnen K.F. Martinez Arias A. van Oudenaarden A. Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal somitogenesis in gastruloids.Nature. 2020; 582: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), likely due to the broader time range that we analyzed. Comparison of our results with a recently published scRNA-seq dataset of mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis (Pijuan-Sala et al., 2019Pijuan-Sala B. Griffiths J.A. Guibentif C. Hiscock T.W.

Ho D.L.L. et al.A single-cell molecular map of mouse gastrulation and early organogenesis.Nature. 2019; 566: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) showed a striking degree of similarity (Figures S2A–S2G). To understand whether the formation of the cardiac portion mimics developmentally relevant processes, we first analyzed the temporal expression of key genes involved in cardiovascular specification (Figures 1G–1K and S1O–S1S). Similar to what happens during embryonic development (Lescroart et al., 2014Lescroart F. Chabab S. Lin X. Rulands S. Paulissen C. Rodolosse A. Auer H. Achouri Y. Dubois C.

MesP1: a novel basic helix-loop-helix protein expressed in the nascent mesodermal cells during mouse gastrulation.Development. 1996; 122: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the first upregulated cardiac gene was Mesp1, which was expressed around 96 h and then rapidly downregulated (Figures 1G, 2A , S1O, S2H, and S2I). Using a Mesp1-GFP reporter ESC line (Bondue et al., 2011Bondue A. Tännler S. Chiapparo G. Chabab S. Ramialison M. Paulissen C. Beck B. Harvey R. Blanpain C.

Cell Biol. 2011; 192: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and live light-sheet imaging, we observed that Mesp1 expression started in a mosaic-like manner at 96 h and then Mesp1-positive cells were first confined to the anterior side before slowly disappearing after 120 h (Figure 2B; Video S2). Concurrently with the elongation and formation of an anterior-posterior axis, Gata6-expressing cells, marking early cardiac differentiation, were localized to the anterior side in gastruloids generated from Gata6-Venus ESCs (Freyer et al., 2015Freyer L.

Gata6 expression was maintained over time (Figures S2L and S2M). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/5abc5afc-e60a-438c-b7ae-8c57874174c8/mmc4.mp4Loading ...

Glodowski C.R. Hayward P.C. Collignon J. Gustavsen C. Serup P. et al.Anteroposterior polarity and elongation in the absence of extra-embryonic tissues and of spatially localised signalling in gastruloids: mammalian embryonic organoids.Development. 2017; 144: 3894-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Wnt activity was found to be higher in the posterior region, coincident with the Brachyury-positive pole, and progressively decreased toward the anterior portion (Figures S2N and S2O), supporting a role for Wnt signaling in determining the positioning of the cardiac compartment along the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis. From this stage onward, the early differentiation genes Nkx2-5 and Hcn4 were increasingly expressed (Figures 1H, 1I, S1P, and S1Q), followed by genes marking mature cardiomyocytes (α-actinin/Actn2 and Ryr2; Figures 1J, 1K, S1R, and S1S). This sequence of gene expression shows that gastruloids, stimulated with cardiogenic factors, recapitulate the temporal and spatial gene expression dynamics of cardiac development from the specification of cardiac progenitors to the formation of a beating cardiac structure. In cardiomyocytes, physical contraction is coupled to electrical excitation through intracellular changes of Ca2+ (Tyser et al., 2016Tyser R.C. Miranda A.M. Chen C.-M. Davidson S.M. Srinivas S. Riley P.R. Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heartbeat.eLife. 2016; 5: e17113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To evaluate the functionality of the gastruloid cardiac domain, we thus assessed calcium transients, momentary spikes in voltage, by live gastruloid imaging via light-sheet microscopy (at 168 h). Image analysis revealed rhythmic calcium spiking in beating areas with a frequency comparable to beating rates observed in embryos from the crescent stage to the linear heart tube (Tyser et al., 2016Tyser R.C. Miranda A.M. Chen C.-M. Davidson S.M. Srinivas S. Riley P.R. Calcium handling precedes cardiac differentiation to initiate the first heartbeat.eLife. 2016; 5: e17113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Figures 2D–2F; Video S3). Drugs interfering with calcium transport, including the l-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine and the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, either completely inhibited these transients (Figure S2P) or caused an increase in spiking frequency (Figures S2Q and S2R), respectively. These data demonstrate that the cardiac compartments found in late gastruloids (168 h) exhibit Ca2+-handling properties compatible with functional cardiomyocytes. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/9007511e-f446-46b9-8772-19072969a8db/mmc5.mp4Loading ...

Mesp1+ Light-Sheet Cell Tracking and 3D Rendering of Mesp1+ Cell Tracking from 96 to 120 h, Related to Figure 2 During embryonic development, the continuous cross-talk of endothelial cells with the developing heart is a prerequisite for cardiomyocyte maturation, function, and survival (Brutsaert, 2003Brutsaert D.L. Cardiac endothelial-myocardial signaling: its role in cardiac growth, contractile performance, and rhythmicity.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 59-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). For this reason, we tested whether such tissue-tissue interactions could potentially take place in developing gastruloids, focusing on cardiovascular progenitors expressing the well-known marker Flk1 (also known as Kdr or Vegfr2; Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J. Huber T.L. Keller G.M. Multipotent flk-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells give rise to the cardiomyocyte, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle lineages.Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In 96-h gastruloids derived from a Flk1-GFP reporter ESC line (Jakobsson et al., 2010Jakobsson L. Franco C.A. Bentley K. Collins R.T. Ponsioen B. Aspalter I.M. Rosewell I. Busse M. Thurston G. Medvinsky A. et al.Endothelial cells dynamically compete for the tip cell position during angiogenic sprouting.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 943-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), Flk1 was expressed at the anterior pole opposite to Brachyury (Figure 3A). Over time, Flk1 expression persisted in the anterior portion of the gastruloids (Figures 3B, S3A, and S3B), and Flk1-positive cells started to form a vascular-like network of spindle-shaped cells (Figure 3C; Video S4) that stained positive for the endothelial marker CD31 (Figures 3D and S3C). In an in vitro angiogenesis assay, Flk1-positive cells that were isolated by FACS from 168-h gastruloids and plated on Matrigel formed vascular-like networks similar to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Figures 3E and S3D). Interestingly, scRNA-seq analysis revealed the expression of typical endothelial markers (Figures 1E and 3F–3H) and suggested maturation of endothelial cells over time. Indeed, the upper portion of the endothelial cluster, corresponding to later stage (168 h) gastruloids (Figure 1F), expressed higher levels of genes associated with the Notch pathway (Figures 3I and 3J), which in vivo is involved in vascular morphogenesis, sprouting, and remodeling (Fischer et al., 2004Fischer A.

https://openalex.org/W3106477851,"COVID-19 emerged in November 2019 leading to a global pandemic that has not only resulted in widespread medical complications and loss of life, but has also impacted global economies and transformed daily life. The current rapid response study in a convenience online sample quickly recruited 2,065 participants across the United States, Canada, and Europe in late March and early April 2020. Cross-sectional findings indicated elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to historical norms, which were positively associated with COVID-19 concern more strongly than epidemiological data signifying risk (e.g., world and country confirmed cases). Employment loss was positively associated with greater depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern, and depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern were significantly associated with more stringent self-quarantine behavior. The rapid collection of data during the early phase of this pandemic is limited by under-representation of non-White and middle age and older adults. Nevertheless, these findings have implications for interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3104772331,"Despite the profound health and economic implications of Covid-19, there is only limited knowledge to date about the role of economic concerns, health worries and social distancing for mental health outcomes during the pandemic. We analyze online survey data from the nationally representative “Understanding America Study” (UAS) covering the period of March 10-31st 2020 (sample size: 6,585). Mental health is assessed by the validated PHQ-4 instrument for measuring symptoms of depression and anxiety. About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential implications of the virus for respondents’ own health and social distancing also predicted increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic in the US, albeit less strongly. Our findings point towards the possibility of a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic, with economic concerns being a key driving force of this crisis. These results highlight the likely importance of economic countermeasures and social policy for mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on adult mental health in the US over and above an effective public health response."

We aimed to investigate the needs of healthcare professionals and the technical difficulties faced by them during the initial outbreak. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among the healthcare workforce in the most populous cities from three Latin American countries in April 2020. In total, 1,082 participants were included. Of these, 534 (49.4%), 263 (24.3%), and 114 (10.5%) were physicians, nurses, and other professionals, respectively. At least 70% of participants reported a lack of PPE. The most common shortages were shortages in gown coverall suits (643, 59.4%), N95 masks (600, 55.5%), and face shields (569, 52.6%). Professionals who performed procedures that generated aerosols reported shortages more frequently (p&lt;0.05). Professionals working in the emergency department and primary care units reported more shortages than those working in intensive care units and hospital-based wards (p&lt;0.001). Up to 556 (51.4%) participants reported the lack of sufficient knowledge about using PPE. Professionals working in public institutions felt less prepared, received less training, and had no protocols compared with their peers in working private institutions (p&lt;0.001). Although the study sample corresponded to different hospital centers in different cities from the participating countries, sampling was non-random. Healthcare professionals in Latin America may face more difficulties than those from other countries, with 7 out of 10 professionals reporting that they did not have the necessary resources to care for patients with COVID-19. Technical and logistical difficulties should be addressed in the event of a future outbreak, as they have a negative impact on healthcare workers. Clinical trial registration: NCT04486404"

https://openalex.org/W3102345351,"Background As a pandemic, a most-common pattern resembled organizing pneumonia (OP) has been identified by CT findings in novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We aimed to delineate the evolution of CT findings and outcome in OP of COVID-19. Materials and methods 106 COVID-19 patients with OP based on CT findings were retrospectively included and categorized into non-severe (mild/common) and severe (severe/critical) groups. CT features including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, linear opacities and total severity CT score were evaluated at three time intervals from symptom-onset to CT scan (day 0–7, day 8–14, day &gt; 14). Discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU or death), and pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or lesion residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed based on the CT features at different time interval. Results 79 (74.5%) patients were non-severe and 103 (97.2%) were discharged at median day 25 (range, day 8–50) after symptom-onset. Of 67 patients with revisit CT at 2–4 weeks after discharge, 20 (29.9%) had complete absorption of lesions at median day 38 (range, day 30–53) after symptom-onset. Significant differences between complete absorption and residuals groups were found in percentages of consolidation (1.5% vs. 13.8%, P = 0.010), number of involved lobe &gt; 3 (40.0% vs. 72.5%, P = 0.030), CT score &gt; 4 (20.0% vs. 65.0%, P = 0.010) at day 8–14. Conclusion Most OP cases had good prognosis. Approximately one-third of cases had complete absorption of lesions during 1–2 months after symptom-onset while those with increased frequency of consolidation, number of involved lobe &gt; 3, and CT score &gt; 4 at week 2 after symptom-onset may indicate lesion residuals on CT."
https://openalex.org/W3098009808,"Bismuth(III) oxide is included as a radio-opacifier in dental materials, including hydraulic silicate cements, the material of choice for several endodontic procedures. It has been implicated in tooth discoloration after contact with endodontic irrigants, in particular NaOCl solution, To date, there has been no work on the chemistry: all reports have been of clinical findings only. The purpose now was to report the reactions leading to colour change from Bi 2 O 3 in contact with solutions used in routine endodontic practice. Ten-gram portions of Bi 2 O 3 were immersed in either water, NaOH, NaCl, NaOCl or HCl solution, either in the dark or exposed to visible light, and samples retrieved at 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. After washing, these were exposed to either added CO 2 or not, for 1 week while drying, and under the same dark or light conditions. Changes in appearance were monitored by photography and colour measurement, and chemically by X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. 24-week material was studied using electron paramagnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopy; NaOCl-treated material was also examined by scanning electron microscopy. With water, NaCl and NaOH, bismuth subcarbonate was formed. With or without added carbon dioxide, discoloration occurred from pale yellow to light brown when exposed to light, and to a lesser extent in the dark, intensifying with time. In contrast, exposure to NaOCl rapidly formed a dark brown-black sodium bismuthate. With HCl, white BiOCl was formed. Bi 2 O 3 is not at all inert in this context as is commonly believed, denying its principle of use. Previously unreported solution-mediated reaction occurs readily even in water and NaCl solution, forming new compounds that discolour. In contact with NaOCl sodium bismuthate is formed; severe darkening occurs rapidly. The reactivity is such that Bi 2 O 3 is not indicated for dental materials and should be withdrawn from use."
https://openalex.org/W3098615389,"Along the Florida reef tract, stony-coral-tissue-loss disease (SCTLD) has caused extensive mortality of more than 20 scleractinian coral species. The pathogen is unknown, but its epizoology indicates that the disease, facilitated by water currents, has progressed linearly along the tract, affecting reefs at the scale of hundreds of kilometers. To inform ongoing disease mitigation efforts, we examined the small-scale spatial and temporal epidemiology of SCTLD. We established a series of sites in the middle Florida Keys at offshore and inshore locations that had not yet shown signs of SCTLD. We then conducted high-frequency monitoring from February 2018 through September 2019 and documented the onset of SCTLD and its progression through the sites. SCTLD was first observed at one site during early February 2018 and by early March 2018 all sites showed signs of the disease. A dynamic multistate model suggested that disease transmission was independent of coral density and found little evidence of a positive association between a colony showing signs of SCTLD and the condition or distance to its neighboring colonies. The model did, however, indicate that the probability of a colony showing signs of SCTLD increased with increasing colony surface area. These results are consistent with the water-borne transmission of a pathogen that progressed rapidly through the survey area. However, by the end of our survey the progression of SCTLD had slowed, particularly at inshore sites. Many affected colonies no longer exhibited progressive tissue mortality typical of the disease, suggesting the existence of differentially resilient colonies or coral communities, meriting their use for future coral rescue and propagation and disease research. These results are useful for refining ongoing SCTLD mitigation strategies, particularly by determining when disease rates are sufficiently low for direct intervention efforts designed to arrest disease progression on individual coral colonies will be most effective."
https://openalex.org/W3106304111,"In February 2020, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) was raging in Wuhan, China and quickly spreading to the rest of the world. This period was fraught with uncertainty for those in the affected areas. The present investigation examined the role of two potential coping resources during this stressful period of uncertainty: flow and mindfulness. Participants in Wuhan and other major cities affected by COVID-19 ( N = 5115) completed an online survey assessing subjective experiences of flow, mindfulness, and well-being. Longer quarantine was associated with poorer well-being; flow and mindfulness were associated with better well-being on some measures. However, flow—but not mindfulness—moderated the link between quarantine length and well-being, such that people who experienced high levels flow showed little or no association between quarantine length and poorer well-being. These findings suggest that experiencing flow (typically by engaging in flow-inducing activities) may be a particularly effective way to protect against potentially deleterious effects of a period of quarantine."

Our study aims to describe these changes using population-based self-reported data about social and health behavior in a random sample of the Swiss population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present article is two-fold: First, we want to describe the study methodology. Second, we want to report participant characteristics and study findings of the first survey wave to provide some baseline results for our study. Methods Our study design is a longitudinal online panel of a random sample of the Swiss population. We measure outcome indicators covering general well-being, physical and mental health, social support, healthcare use and working state over multiple survey waves. Results From 8,174 contacted individuals, 2,026 individuals participated in the first survey wave which corresponds to a response rate of 24.8%. Most survey participants reported a good to very good general life satisfaction (93.3%). 41.4% of the participants reported a worsened quality of life compared to before the COVID-19 emergency and 9.8% feelings of loneliness. Discussion The COVID-19 Social Monitor is a population-based online survey which informs the public, health authorities, and the scientific community about relevant aspects and potential changes in social and health behavior during the COVID-19 emergency and beyond. Future research will follow up on the described study population focusing on COVID-19 relevant topics such as subgroup differences in the impact of the pandemic on well-being and quality of life or different dynamics of perceived psychological distress."

We estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in District Srinagar. Methods 2906 persons &gt;18 years of age selected from hospital visitors across District Srinagar participated in the study. We tested samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay-based serologic test. Results Age- and gender-standardized seroprevalence was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9% to 4.3%). Age 30–69 years, a recent history of symptoms of an influenza-like-illness, and a history of being placed under quarantine were significantly related to higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two weeks preceding the study, adjusted for test performance, was 32602 with an estimated (median) infection-to-known-case ratio of 46 (95% CI 36 to 57). Conclusions The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies is low in the District. A large proportion of the population is still susceptible to the infection. A sizeable number of infections remain undetected, and a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 are not tested."

Yet limited attention has been paid to graph literacy in people of lower education and lower socioeconomic status (SES). This study aimed to: 1) examine the relationship between graph literacy, numeracy, health literacy and sociodemographic characteristics in a Medicaid-eligible population 2) determine the impact of graph literacy on comprehension and preference for different visual formats. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional online survey among people in the US on Medicaid, and of presumed lower education and SES. Results The mean graph literacy score among 436 participants was 1.47 (SD 1.05, range: 0 to 4). Only graph literacy was significantly associated with overall comprehension (p &lt; .001). Mean comprehension scores were highest for the table format (1.91), closely followed by bar graph (1.85) and icon array (1.80). Information comprehension was aligned with preference scores. Conclusions Graph literacy in a Medicaid-eligible population was lower than previous estimates in the US. Tables were better understood, with icon arrays yielding the lowest score. Preferences aligned with comprehension. Practice implications It may be necessary to reconsider the use of graphic display formats when designing information for people with lower educational levels. Further research is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3102983304,"Background Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) is a validated and safe method to establish the cause of death (COD), mainly in low-resource settings. However, the additional clinical value of MIA in Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients in a high-resource setting is unknown. The objective was to assess if and how MIA changed clinical COD and contributing diagnoses in deceased COVID-19 patients. Methods and findings A prospective observational cohort from April to May 2020 in a 981-bed teaching hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium was established. Patients who died with either PCR-confirmed or radiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection were consecutively included. MIA consisted of whole-body CT and CT-guided Tru-Cut® biopsies. Diagnostic modalities were clinical chart review, radiology, microbiology, and histopathology which were assessed by two independent experts per modality. MIA COD and contributing diagnoses were established during a multi-disciplinary meeting. Clinical COD (CCOD) and contributing diagnosis were abstracted from the discharge letter. The main outcomes were alterations in CCOD and contributing diagnoses after MIA, and the contribution of each diagnostic modality. We included 18 patients, of which 7 after intensive care unit hospitalization. MIA led to an alteration in 15/18 (83%) patients. The CCOD was altered in 5/18 (28%) patients. MIA found a new COD (1/5), a more specific COD (1/5), a less certain COD (1/5), or a contributing diagnosis to be the COD (2/5). Contributing diagnoses were altered in 14/18 (78%) patients: 9 new diagnoses, 5 diagnoses dismissed, 3 made more specific, and 2 made less certain. Overall, histopathology contributed in 14/15 (93%) patients with alterations, radiology and microbiology each in 6/15 (40%), and clinical review in 3/15 (20%). Histopathology was deemed the most important modality in 10 patients, radiology in two patients, and microbiology in one patient. Conclusion MIA, especially histological examination, can add valuable new clinical information regarding the cause of death in COVID-19 patients, even in a high-resource setting with wide access to premortem diagnostic modalities. MIA may provide important clinical insights and should be applied in the current ongoing pandemic. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04366882"
https://openalex.org/W3099648110,"Introduction After having an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), racial and ethnic minorities have less access to care, decreased rates of invasive treatments such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and worse outcomes compared with white patients. The objective of this study was to determine whether the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid eligibility was associated with changes in racial disparities in access, treatments, and outcomes after AMI. Methods Quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences-in-differences analysis of non-Hispanic white and minority patients with acute myocardial infarction in California and Florida from 2010–2015, using linear regression models to estimate the difference-in-differences. This population-based sample included all Medicaid and uninsured patients ages 18–64 hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction in California, which expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act beginning as early as July 2011 in certain counties, and Florida, which did not expand Medicaid. The main outcomes included rates of admission to hospitals capable of performing PCI, rates of transfer for patients who first presented to hospitals that did not perform PCI, rates of PCI during hospitalization and rates of early (within 48 hours of admission) PCI, rates of readmission to the hospital within 30 days, and rates of in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 55,991 hospital admissions met inclusion criteria, 32,540 of which were in California and 23,451 were in Florida. Among patients with AMI who initially presented to a non-PCI hospital, the likelihood of being transferred increased by 12 percentage points (95% CI 2 to 21) for minority patients relative to white patients after the Medicaid expansion. The likelihood of undergoing PCI increased by 3 percentage points (95% CI 0 to 5) for minority patients relative to white patients after the Medicaid expansion. We did not find an association between the Medicaid expansion and racial disparities in overall likelihood of admission to a PCI hospital, hospital readmissions, or in-hospital mortality. Conclusions The Medicaid expansion was associated with a decrease in racial disparities in transfers and rates of PCI after AMI. We did not find an association between the Medicaid expansion and admission to a PCI hospital, readmissions, and in-hospital mortality. Additional factors outside of insurance coverage likely continue to contribute to disparities in outcomes after AMI. These findings are crucial for policy makers seeking to reduce racial disparities in access, treatment and outcomes in AMI."

Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 can correct p.F508del mutation in the CFTR gene in the CFTE29o- cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We used several combinations of Cas9, sgRNA and ssODN and measured editing efficiency in the endogenous CFTR gene and in the co-transfected plasmid containing the CFTR locus with the p.F508del mutation. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) frequency in the CFTR gene in the CFTE29o- cells varied from 1.25% to 2.54% of alleles. The best homology-directed repair (HDR) frequency in the endogenous CFTR locus was 1.42% of alleles. In iPSCs, the NHEJ frequency in the CFTR gene varied from 5.5% to 12.13% of alleles. The best HDR efficacy was 2.38% of alleles. Our results show that p.F508del mutation editing using CRISPR/Cas9 in CF patient-derived iPSCs is a relatively rare event and subsequent cell selection and cultivation should be carried out."
https://openalex.org/W3099069877,"Objective This study examined the association between ActiGraph accelerometer output and energy expenditure across different speeds of walking in persons with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and further generated cut-points that represent a metric for quantifying time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among persons with PD. Methods The sample included 30 persons with mild-to-moderate PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages 2–3) and 30 adults without PD matched by sex and age. All participants completed 5 minutes of quiet, seated rest and then underwent three, 6-minute bouts of walking on a treadmill at three different speeds relative to the individual’s self-selected pace. Activity counts were measured using an ActiGraph accelerometer worn at the waist level on the least affected side for persons with PD and the dominant side for controls. The rate of oxygen consumption, or energy expenditure, was measured using a portable, open-circuit spirometry system. Results Our results indicated a strong association between activity counts and energy expenditure for persons with PD ( R 2 = 0.87) and controls ( R 2 = 0.89). However, the significant difference in slopes resulted in a lower cut-point of 1,354 counts·min -1 for persons with PD than the cut-point of 2,010 counts·min -1 for controls. Conclusion Our results support the application of the disease-specific cut-point for quantifying the amount of time spent in MVPA using ActiGraph accelerometers among persons with mild-to-moderate PD. Such an application may provide accurate estimates of MVPA in this population, and better inform future research examining the possible determinants and consequences of physical activity as well as testing of interventions for changing MVPA in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3042398370,"Based on the decision-theoretical conditions underlying the selection of events for news coverage in science journalism, this article uses a novel input-output analysis to investigate which of the more than eight million scientific study results published between August 2014 and July 2018 have been selected by global journalism to a relevant degree. We are interested in two different structures in the media coverage of scientific results. Firstly, the structure of sources that journalists use, i.e. scientific journals, and secondly, the congruence of the journalistic selection of single results. Previous research suggests that the selection of sources and results follows a certain heavy-tailed distribution, a power law. Mathematically, this distribution can be described with a function of the form C*x -α . We argue that the exponent of such power law distributions can potentially be an indicator to describe selectivity in journalism on a high aggregation level. In our input-output analysis, we look for such patterns in the coverage of all scientific results published in the database Scopus over four years. To get an estimate of the coverage of these results, we use data from the altmetrics provider Altmetric, more precisely their Mainstream-Media-Score (MSM-Score). Based on exploratory analyses, we define papers with a score of 50 or above as Social Impact Papers (SIPs). Over our study period, we identified 5,833 SIPs published in 1,236 journals. For both the distribution of the source selection and the distribution of the selection of single results, an exponentially truncated power law is a better fit than the power law, mostly because we find a steeper decline in the tail of the distributions."
https://openalex.org/W3099565110,"Background Testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) incidence has increased in recent decades along with the use and dose of diagnostic radiation. Here we examine the association between reported exposure to diagnostic radiation and TGCT risk. Methods We conducted a case-control study of men with and without TGCT recruited from hospital- and population-based settings. Participants reported on exposures to 1) x-ray or CT below the waist and 2) lower GI series or barium enema, which consists of a series of x-rays of the colon. We also derived a combined measure of exposure. We used logistic regression to determine the risk of developing TGCT according to categories of exposures (0, 1–2, or ≥3 exposures) and age at first exposure, adjusting for age, year of birth, race, county, body mass index at diagnosis, family history of TGCT, and personal history of cryptorchidism. Results There were 315 men with TGCT and 931 men without TGCT in our study. Compared to no exposures, risk of TGCT was significantly elevated among those reporting at least three exposures to x-ray or CT (OR ≥3 exposures , 1.78; 95% CI, 1.15–2.76; p = 0.010), lower GI series or barium enema (OR ≥3 exposures , 4.58; 95% CI, 2.39–8.76; p&lt;0.001), and the combined exposure variable (OR ≥3 exposures , 1.59; 95% CI, 1.05–2.42; p = 0.029). The risk of TGCT was elevated for those exposed to diagnostic radiation at age 0–10 years, compared to those first exposed at age 18 years or later, although this association did not reach statistical significance (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.91–4.42; p = 0.086). Conclusions Exposure to diagnostic radiation below the waist may increase TGCT risk. If these results are validated, efforts to reduce diagnostic radiation doses to the testes should be prioritized."
https://openalex.org/W3102931414,"Urbanization could potentially modify Aedes albopictus’ ecology by changing the dynamics of the species, and affecting their breeding sites due to environmental changes, and thus contribute to dengue outbreaks. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the biting rhythm, fecundity and longevity of adult female Ae . albopictus in relation to urbanization strata; urban, suburban and rural areas in Penang Island, Malaysia. The experiments were done in comparison to a laboratory strain. Twenty-four hours biting activity of all the mosquito strains showed a clear bimodal biting activity, with morning and evening twilight peaks. The interaction effect between biting time and mosquito strains was not significant. Meanwhile, differences in fecundity among mosquito strains were statistically significant (F(3,442) = 10.559, P &lt; 0.05) with urban areas having higher mean number of eggs (mean = 107.69, standard error = 3.98) than suburban (mean = 94.48, standard error = 5.18), and rural areas (mean = 72.52, standard error = 3.87). Longevity of adult females were significantly higher (F(3,441) = 31.259, P &lt; 0.05) for mosquito strains from urban areas compared to the other strains. These findings would provide crucial information for the planning of control programs in Malaysia, particularly Penang."
https://openalex.org/W3104269095,"Zinc deficiency is a major public health problem in vulnerable populations of Latin America and the Caribbean. Biofortification of rice ( Oryza sativa L.) with zinc has the potential to alleviate zinc deficiencies. However, as plant breeding processes can alter grain culinary quality and favorable sensory attributes, grain quality and consumer acceptability need to be assessed prior to releasing a variety to the public. A grain quality characterization and a sensory acceptability analysis were carried out with two varieties of zinc biofortified rice and a local control both in Bolivia and Colombia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical parameters that are significant in consumer acceptance and to determine the acceptability of zinc biofortified rice by consumers. Results of physicochemical parameters were analyzed using ANOVA. The sensory acceptability was evaluated in 243 adults utilizing a 7-point hedonic scale and a Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used to determine the overall acceptability of the varieties. Biofortified rice variety T2-11 and MAC-18 -control 1- were equally accepted by consumers in Bolivia with no significant differences (p&lt;0.05). The grain quality analysis reported that both presented long and slender rice grains (L&gt;7.5 mm and L/B&gt;3), an intermediate to high amylose content (&gt;25%) and a similar level of chalkiness. In Colombia, the biofortified variety 035 presented a higher score in overall acceptance in comparison to biofortified variety 021 and the local variety CICA4 -control 2-. However, no significant differences were observed (p&lt;0.05). Conversely to the other two varieties, the biofortified variety 035 presented the largest size grain (L/B = 2.97), a lower chalkiness and an amylose content above 25%. This study shows that the grain quality properties of rice have an influence on acceptability and that zinc biofortified rice varieties are accepted by consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3100542737,"Objectives This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of deep learning algorithm trained by single view (anterior-posterior (AP) or lateral view) with that trained by multiple views (both views together) in diagnosis of mastoiditis on mastoid series and compare the diagnostic performance between the algorithm and radiologists. Methods Total 9,988 mastoid series (AP and lateral views) were classified as normal or abnormal (mastoiditis) based on radiographic findings. Among them 792 image sets with temporal bone CT were classified as the gold standard test set and remaining sets were randomly divided into training (n = 8,276) and validation (n = 920) sets by 9:1 for developing a deep learning algorithm. Temporal (n = 294) and geographic (n = 308) external test sets were also collected. Diagnostic performance of deep learning algorithm trained by single view was compared with that trained by multiple views. Diagnostic performance of the algorithm and two radiologists was assessed. Inter-observer agreement between the algorithm and radiologists and between two radiologists was calculated. Results Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of algorithm using multiple views (0.971, 0.978, and 0.965 for gold standard, temporal, and geographic external test sets, respectively) showed higher values than those using single view (0.964/0.953, 0.952/0.961, and 0.961/0.942 for AP view/lateral view of gold standard, temporal external, and geographic external test sets, respectively) in all test sets. The algorithm showed statistically significant higher specificity compared with radiologists (p = 0.018 and 0.012). There was substantial agreement between the algorithm and two radiologists and between two radiologists (κ = 0.79, 0.8, and 0.76). Conclusion The deep learning algorithm trained by multiple views showed better performance than that trained by single view. The diagnostic performance of the algorithm for detecting mastoiditis on mastoid series was similar to or higher than that of radiologists."
https://openalex.org/W3105940507,"Background The study assessed the epigenetic regulation and the role of microRNA (miR) expression in locally advanced triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) and comparison with the clinico-pathological variables and survival. Methods Fifty patients of locally advanced TNBC during the period 2011–2013 were included. Expression level of test microRNA (miR-182 and miR-18a) was determined using Taqman quantitative Real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from formalin fixed paraffin embedded biopsy blocks. Clinical and demographic information and survival data was retrieved from the Hospital medical records. Results An improved clinical complete response (cCR) was observed in patients with age ≥ 45 years (80%), premenopausal status (70%), tumor size &lt; 6 cms (80%), nodal status N0-N1 (95%) and grade II-III tumor (80%). A statistically significant correlation was observed on comparison of cCR with menopausal status (p-value 0.020), T category (p-value 0.018) and the clinical nodal status (p-value 0.003). pCR also correlated with clinical nodal status (p-value 0.008). Epigenetically, miR-18a under expression (&lt; 8.84) was most commonly associated with tumor size &lt; 6 cms (76.7%), clinical nodal status N0-N1 (90%), cCR (60%) and pCR (53.3%). A similar trend was observed with miR-182. Statistical significance was observed with T category (p-values 0.003 and 0.004), clinical nodal status (p-values 0.001 and 0.001), clinical response (p-values 0.002 and 0.002) and pathological response (p-values 0.007 and 0.006) with respect to miR-18a and miR-182, respectively. Also, the menopausal status significantly correlated with the miR-182 expression (p-value 0.009). miR-182 overexpression (≥ 6.32) was not observed in any of the postmenopausal patients. A univariate cox proportional hazard regression model also showed statistical interactions (p-values &lt;0.004). Conclusion miR-182 and miR-18a overexpression correlates with worse clinical and pathological tumor characteristics in locally advanced TNBC and hence could be used to predict the outcomes and prognosis in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3102764634,"Exosomes are a group of small membranous vesicles that are shed into the extracellular environment by tumoral or non-tumoral cells and contribute to cellular communication by delivering micro RNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of exosomal miRNAs from colorectal cancer cell lines in tumorigenesis, by affecting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are vital constituents of the tumor microenvironment. To analyze the effect of exosomal miRNA on the tumor microenvironment, migration of the monocytic cell line THP-1 was evaluated via Transwell migration assay using CAFs isolated from colon cancer patients. The migration assay was performed with CAFs ± CCL7-blocking antibody and CAFs that were treated with exosomes isolated from colon cancer cell lines. To identify the associated exosomal miRNAs, miRNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed. The migration assay revealed that THP-1 migration was decreased in CCL7-blocking antibody-expressing and exosome-treated CAFs. Colon cancer cell lines contained miRNA let-7d in secreted exosomes targeting the chemokine CCL7. Exosomes from colorectal cancer cell lines affected CCL7 secretion from CAFs, possibly via the miRNA let-7d, and interfered with the migration of CCR2+ monocytic THP-1 cells in vitro ."
https://openalex.org/W3103509893,"Aim We aimed to identify variables associated with gestational age at full oral feeding in a cohort of very preterm infants. Methods In this retrospective study, all infants born below 32 weeks of gestation and admitted to a level III neonatal unit in 2015 were included. We dichotomized our population of 122 infants through the median age at full oral feeding, and explored which variables were statistically different between the two groups. We then used linear regression analysis to study the association between variables known from the literature and variables we had identified and age at full oral feeding. Results The median postnatal age at full oral feeding was 36 6/7weeks post menstrual age (Q1-Q3 35 6/7-392/7), and was associated with the duration of hospital of stay. In the univariable linear regression, the variables significantly associated with full oral feeding were gestational age, socioeconomic status, sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus, duration of supplementary oxygen, of non-invasive and invasive ventilation, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In the multivariable regression analysis, duration of non-invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and patent ductus arteriosus were associated with an older age at full oral feeding, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia the single most potent predictor. Discussion Lung disease severity is a major determinant of age at full oral feeding and thus length of stay in this population. Other factors associated with FOF include socioeconomic status and patent ductus arteriosus, There is a need for research addressing evidence-based bundles of care for these infants at risk of long-lasting feeding and neurodevelopmental impairments."
https://openalex.org/W3106311358,"The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has been hypothesized to drive interannual variability in Bermudan coral extension rates and reef-scale calcification through the provisioning of nutritional pulses associated with negative NAO winters. However, the direct influence of the NAO on Bermudan coral calcification rates remains to be determined and may vary between species and reef sites owing to implicit differences in coral life history strategies and environmental gradients across the Bermuda reef platform. In this study, we investigated the connection between negative NAO winters and Bermudan Diploria labyrinthiformis , Pseudodiploria strigosa , and Orbicella franksi coral calcification rates across rim reef, lagoon, and nearshore reef sites. Linear mixed effects modeling detected an inverse correlation between D . labyrinthiformis calcification rates and the winter NAO index, with higher rates associated with increasingly negative NAO winters. Conversely, there were no detectable correlations between P . strigosa or O . franksi calcification rates and the winter NAO index suggesting that coral calcification responses associated with negative NAO winters could be species-specific. The correlation between coral calcification rates and winter NAO index was significantly more negative at the outer rim of the reef (Hog Reef) compared to a nearshore reef site (Whalebone Bay), possibly indicating differential influence of the NAO as a function of the distance from the reef edge. Furthermore, a negative calcification anomaly was observed in 100% of D . labyrinthiformis cores in association with the 1988 coral bleaching event with a subsequent positive calcification anomaly in 1989 indicating a post-bleaching recovery in calcification rates. These results highlight the importance of assessing variable interannual coral calcification responses between species and across inshore-offshore gradients to interannual atmospheric modes such as the NAO, thermal stress events, and potential interactions between ocean warming and availability of coral nutrition to improve projections for future coral calcification rates under climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3098264434,"Tup1-Cyc8 (also known as Tup1-Ssn6) is a general transcriptional corepressor. D-Mannitol (mannitol) and D-sorbitol (sorbitol) are the major polyols in nature. Budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is unable to assimilate mannitol or sorbitol, but acquires the ability to assimilate mannitol due to a spontaneous mutation in TUP1 or CYC8 . In this study, we found that spontaneous mutation of TUP1 or CYC8 also permitted assimilation of sorbitol. Some spontaneous nonsense mutations of CYC8 produced a truncated Cyc8 with a C-terminal polyglutamine. The effects were guanidine hydrochloride-sensitive and were dependent on Hsp104, but were complemented by introduction of CYC8 , ruling out involvement of a prion. Assimilation of mannitol and sorbitol conferred by other mutations of TUP1 or CYC8 was guanidine hydrochloride-tolerant. It is physiologically reasonable that S . cerevisiae carries this mechanism to acquire the ability to assimilate major polyols in nature."
https://openalex.org/W3099866643,"Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase ( https://breedbase.org/ ) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder’s informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid Zea mays , 314 triploid Musa acuminata , and 924 diploid Manihot esculenta samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively."

We performed a molecular epidemiology study of N . meningitidis serogroup B (MenB) causing IMD in Italy between 2014 and 2017 to describe circulating strains belonging to this serogroup, with particular regards to the two factor H-binding protein (FHbp) subfamilies present in the bivalent MenB vaccine. Materials and methods A total of 109 culture positive and 46 culture negative MenB samples were collected within the National Surveillance System (NSS) of IMD in Italy and molecularly analyzed by conventional methods. Results Overall, 71 MenB samples showed the FHbp subfamily A and 83 the subfamily B. The subfamily variants were differently distributed by age. The most frequent variants, A05 and B231, were associated with cc213 and cc162, respectively. All MenB with the FHbp A05 variant displayed the PorA P1.22,14 and 85.7% of them the FetA F5-5. The majority of MenB with the FHbp B231 variant showed the PorA P1.22,14 (65.4%) and 84.6%, the FetA F3-6. Conclusion MenB circulating in Italy were characterized by a remarkable association between clonal complex and FHbp variants, although a high degree of genetic diversity observed over time. A dynamic trend in clonal complexes distribution within MenB was detected. Our results stress the importance of continued meningococcal molecular surveillance to evaluate the potential vaccine coverage of the available MenB vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3103078395,"To date, several medication adherence instruments have been developed and validated worldwide. However, most instruments have only assessed medication adherence from the patient’s perspective. The aim was to develop and validate the PATIENT-Medication Adherence Instrument (P-MAI) and the HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL-Medication Adherence Instrument (H-MAI) to assess medication adherence from the patient’s and healthcare professional (HCP)’s perspectives. The P-MAI-12 and H-MAI-12 were developed using the nominal group technique. The face and content validity was determined by an expert panel and piloted. The initial version of these instruments consisted of 12 items were validated from October-December 2018 at a primary care clinic in Malaysia. Included were patients aged ≥21 years, diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, taking at least one oral hypoglycaemic agent and who could understand English. The HCPs recruited were family medicine specialists or trainees. To assess validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and concurrent validity were performed; internal consistency and test-retest were performed to assess its reliability. A total of 120/158 patients (response rate = 75.9%) and 30/33 HCPs (response rate = 90.9%) agreed to participate. EFA found three problematic items in both instruments, which was then removed. The final version of the P-MAI-9 and the HMAI-9 had 9 items each with two domains (adherence = 2 items and knowledge/belief = 7 items). For concurrent validity, the total score of the P-MAI-9 and the H-MAI-9 were not significantly different (p = 0.091), indicating that medication adherence assessed from both the patient’s and HCP’s perspectives were similar. Both instruments achieved acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α: P-MAI-9 = 0.722; H-MAI-9 = 0.895). For the P-MAI-9, 7/9 items showed no significant difference between test and retest whereas 8/9 items in the H-MAI-9 showed significant difference at test and retest (p&gt;0.05). In conclusion, the P-MAI-9 and H-MAI-9 had low sensitivity and high specificity suggesting that both instruments can be used for identifying patients more likely to be non-adherent to their medications."
https://openalex.org/W3098304685,"Amphibian populations are declining globally, however, the contribution of reduced reproduction to declines is unknown. We investigated associations between morphological (weight/snout-vent length, nuptial pad colour/size, forelimb width/size) and physiological (nuptial pad/testis histomorphology, plasma hormones, gene expression) features with reproductive success in males as measured by amplexus success and fertility rate (% eggs fertilised) in laboratory maintained Silurana / Xenopus tropicalis . We explored the robustness of these features to predict amplexus success/fertility rate by investigating these associations within a sub-set of frogs exposed to anti-androgens (flutamide (50 μg/L)/linuron (9 or 45 μg/L)). In unexposed males, nuptial pad features (size/colour/number of hooks/androgen receptor mRNA) were positively associated with amplexus success, but not with fertility rate. In exposed males, many of the associations with amplexus success differed from untreated animals (they were either reversed or absent). In the exposed males forelimb width/nuptial pad morphology were also associated with fertility rate. However, a more darkly coloured nuptial pad was positively associated with amplexus success across all groups and was indicative of androgen status. Our findings demonstrate the central role for nuptial pad morphology in reproductive success in S . tropicalis , however, the lack of concordance between unexposed/exposed frogs complicates understanding of the utility of features of nuptial pad morphology as biomarkers in wild populations. In conclusion, our work has indicated that nuptial pad and forelimb morphology have potential for development as biomarkers of reproductive health in wild anurans, however, further research is needed to establish this."
https://openalex.org/W3099666079,"Individuals within populations often show consistent variation in behavioural and physiological traits which are frequently inter-correlated, potentially leading to phenotypic integration. Understanding the mechanisms behind such integration is a key task in evolutionary ecology, and melanin based colouration has been suggested to play a pivotal role. In birds, most of plumage colour variation is determined by two types of melanin, eumelanin and phaeomelanin, but the role of phaeomelanin in avian phenotype integration has been barely investigated. Here, we test for covariation between phaeomelanin-based colouration, behavioural traits (i.e. nest territoriality, aggressiveness, breath rate and parental behaviour) and corticosterone in feathers in the polymorphic scops owl Otus scops , a bird species in which more phaeomelanic individuals display reddish colourations. In males, we observed that reddish males took longer to return to their nests and showed higher levels of feather CORT than more greyish ones. Behaviour and feather CORT were not associated to plumage colour in females. The found associations between redness, behaviour and feather CORT in males, but not in females, might suggest the existence of a sex-specific integrated phaeomelanic phenotype in scops owls."

Recent reports indicate that a small but significant number of inflammatory cells are infiltrated into the aortic media and adventitia in MFS. However, little is known about the contribution of myeloid cells to aortic aneurysmal formation. In this study, we ablated the TGF-β type II receptor gene Tgfbr2 in myeloid cells of Fbn1 C1039G/+ MFS mice ( Fbn1 C1039G/+ ; LysM-Cre/+ ; Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice, hereinafter called Fbn1 C1039G/+ ; Tgfbr2 MyeKO ) and evaluated macrophage infiltration and TGF-β signaling in the aorta. Aneurysmal formation with fragmentation and disarray of medial elastic fibers observed in MFS mice was significantly ameliorated in Fbn1 C1039G/+ ; Tgfbr2 MyeKO mice. In the aorta of Fbn1 C1039G/+ ; Tgfbr2 MyeKO mice, both canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signals were attenuated and the number of infiltrated F4/80-positive macrophages was significantly reduced. In vitro , TGF-β enhanced the migration capacity of RAW264.7 macrophages. These findings suggest that TGF-β signaling in myeloid cells promotes aortic aneurysmal formation and its inhibition might be a novel therapeutic target in MFS."
https://openalex.org/W3105120592,"Broad- and fine-leaved woody species respond to seasonal changes from wet to dry season differently. For example, broad-leaved species shed their leaves earlier, while fine-leaved species, especially acacias retain green foliage well into the dry season. These differences are expected to result in variation in selection of broad- and fine-leaved woody species as browse by free-ranging goats. We tested the hypothesis that free-ranging goats select broad-leaved woody species more than fine-leaved species during wet (growth) season and fine-leaved woody species more than broad-leaved species during dry season. In addition, we tested if broad- and fine-leaved woody species had different foliar dry matter digestibility and chemical composition (crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, total phenolics and condensed tannins concentration). Free-ranging goats were observed foraging on broad- and fine-leaved woody species over a two-year period (2014 and 2015) during three seasons: early wet (October/November), late wet (February/March) and dry (May/June). Ivlev’s selectivity or Jacob’s index ( E i ) was calculated for five woody species (two broad-leaved and three fine-leaved) browsed by goats during wet and dry season. Jacob’s selectivity index was higher for broad–leaved ( Ziziphus mucronata and Searsia (Rhus) tenuinervis ) than fine-leaved woody species ( Acacia nilotica , Acacia karroo and Dichrostachys cinerea ) during wet season. However, the trend was reversed during dry season with fine-leaved species having higher Jacob’s selectivity index than broad-leaved species. Leaf dry matter digestibility and chemical composition was similar between broad- and fine-leaved woody species throughout the year. We conclude that goats selected broad-leaved woody species during wet season when browse was plentiful and then switched to fine-leaved species which retained leaves during dry season."

This study examined whether kinematic differences exist between accurate and inaccurate goal-kicks and determined the relationships between technical factors and accuracy. Eighteen elite to sub-elite AF players performed 15 x 30 m goal-kicks on an AF training ground, with three-dimensional kinematics collected using the Xsens inertial measurement system (Xsens Technologies B.V., Enschede, the Netherlands). A general linear mixed modelling approach and regression-based statistics were employed to quantify differences between accurate and inaccurate goal kicks and the relationships between technical factors and accuracy. Accurate goal-kicks were characterised by a straighter approach line, with less kick-leg joint range of motion (knee and hip), lower linear velocity (centre of mass, foot speed), angular velocity (knee and shank), and less support-leg knee flexion during the kicking phase compared to inaccurate goal-kicks. At the end of the follow through, players produced greater ankle plantarflexion and a straighter-leg line in accurate goal-kicks. Findings in this research indicated that many factors interact with goal-kicking accuracy in AF, ranging from the players' approach line path, their support-leg mechanics, the kick-leg swing motion, to the final position of the kicker during their follow through."

https://openalex.org/W3103815306,"Background First-line antiretroviral treatment failure has become a public health concern in high, low and middle-income countries with high mortality and morbidity In Ethiopia, around 710,000 peoples were living with HIV and 420,000 of them were receiving ART in 2017. Little is known about the magnitude of first-line ART treatment failure and its associated factors in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Therefore, this study was aimed to find the magnitude of first-line ART treatment failure and its associated factors among adult patients attending ART clinic at Southwest shoa zone public hospitals. Methods Institutions based cross-sectional study was employed from February 1 to April 2, 2019. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 350 adult patients on ART using a systematic random sampling technique. The collected data were coded and entered into Epidata version 3 and exported to STATA SE version 14 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with first-line ART treatment failure. At 95% confidence level strength of association was measured using Odds ratio. Variables with a p-value of ≤ 0.25 in the bivariable analysis were considered as a candidate variable for multivariable analysis. To get the final variables step-wise backward selection procedure was used and those in the final model were selected at a p-value &lt;0.05. Finally, texts, simple frequency tables, and figures were used to present the findings. Results In this study the magnitude of first-line ART treatment failure was 33.42%. Absence of baseline opportunistic infection AOR = 0.362 (95%CI0.178, 0.735), Staying on first-line ART for &lt;5 years AOR = 0.47 (95%CI 0.252, 0.878), Nevirapine containing ART regimen AOR = 3.07 (95%CI 1.677, 5.63), Baseline CD4 count ≥100 cells/mm3 AOR = 0.299 (95%CI 0.152 0.591), absence of opportunistic infections after ART initiation AOR = 0.257 (95%CI 0.142, .467), time taking greater than an one-hour to reach health facility AOR 1.85 (95%CI 1.022 3.367) were significantly associated with first-line ART treatment failure. Conclusion The magnitude of first-line ART treatment failure was high in the study area. Base-line opportunistic infection, duration on first-line ART, NVP based ART, Baseline CD4 count level, OI after ART initiation, and time it takes to reach health facility were independent determinants of first-line ART treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W3104006005,"Coral reefs are critically important marine ecosystems that are threatened worldwide by cumulative impacts of global climate change and local stressors. The Solomon Islands comprise the southwestern boundary of the Coral Triangle, the global center of coral diversity located in the Indo-Pacific, and represent a bright spot of comparatively healthy coral reef ecosystems. However, reports on the status of coral reefs in the Solomon Islands are based on monitoring conducted at 5 stations in 2003–2004 and 2006–2007, with no information on how corals in this region have responded to more recent global bleaching events and other local stressors. In this study, we compare reef condition (substrate composition) and function (taxonomic and morphological diversity of hard corals) among 15 reefs surveyed in the Western Province, Solomon Islands that span a range of local disturbance and conservation histories. Overall, we found high cover of live hard coral (15–64%) and diverse coral assemblages despite an unprecedented 36-month global bleaching event in the three years leading up to our surveys in 2018. However, there was significant variation in coral cover and diversity across the 15 reefs surveyed, suggesting that impacts of global disturbance events are moderated at smaller scales by local anthropogenic factors (fisheries extraction, land-use impacts, marine management) and environmental (hydrodynamics) conditions. Our study provides evidence that relatively healthy reefs persist at some locations in the Solomon Islands and that local stewardship practices have the potential to impact reef condition at subregional scales. As coral reef conservation becomes increasingly urgent in the face of escalating cumulative threats, prioritising sites for management efforts is critical. Based on our findings and the high dependency of Solomon Islanders on coral reef ecosystem services, we advocate that the Western Province, Solomon Islands be considered of high conservation priority."

The present study investigates whether mere labelling of political statements as endorsed by a right-wing populist party influences people’s agreement with such statements. In the study (pre-registered; N = 221 German voters), it is shown than that supporters of the right-wing populist party indicated higher agreement with the statements when they were labelled as being endorsed by the party (vs. not labelled), whereas non-supporters indicated lower agreement with the labelled than with the non-labelled statements. We conclude that labelling of the very same political statements changes voters’ agreement with these statements. The results imply that rather than (dis)agreeing with the content of the statements per se, people may (dis)agree with right-wing populist statements because they come from a specific source (i.e., the right-wing populist party)."
https://openalex.org/W3103776022,"This study develops and tests a theoretical framework, which draws on herd behavior literature and explains how and under what conditions tabloids’ attention to misinformation drives broadsheets’ attention to misinformation. More specifically, the study analyzes all cases of political and business misinformation in Switzerland and the U.K. between 2002 and 2018, which are selected based on corresponding Swiss and U.K. press councils’ rulings (N = 114). The findings show that during amplifying events (i.e., election campaigns and economic downturns) tabloids allocate more attention to political and business misinformation, which, in turn, drives broadsheets to allocate more attention to the misinformation as well–and especially if the misinformation serves broadsheets’ ideological goals. Moreover, the findings show differences between Swiss and U.K. media markets only in the case of business misinformation and suggest that the attention allocation process depends in particular on the strength of the amplifying event in a media market. Thereby, this study contributes to the understanding of how and under what conditions misinformation spreads in media markets."

For the most part, however, each microfluidics platform is developed with a specific task in mind, rather than as a general-purpose device with a wide-range of functionality. Here, we show how a microfluidic system, originally developed to investigate protein phase behavior, can be modified and repurposed for another application, namely DNA construction. We added new programable controllers to direct the flow of reagents across the chip. We designed the assembly of a combinatorial Golden Gate DNA library using TeselaGen DESIGN software and used the repurposed microfluidics platform to assemble the designed library from off-chip prepared DNA assembly pieces. Further experiments verified the sequences and function of the on-chip assembled DNA constructs."
https://openalex.org/W3100625557,"In recent years, great progress has been made in the technical aspects of automatic speaker verification (ASV). However, the promotion of ASV technology is still a very challenging issue, because most technologies are still very sensitive to new, unknown and spoofing conditions. Most previous studies focused on extracting target speaker information from natural speech. This paper aims to design a new ASV corpus with multi-speaking styles and investigate the ASV robustness to these different speaking styles. We first release this corpus in the Zenodo website for public research, in which each speaker has several text-dependent and text-independent singing, humming and normal reading speech utterances. Then, we investigate the speaker discrimination of each speaking style in the feature space. Furthermore, the intra and inter-speaker variabilities in each different speaking style and cross-speaking styles are investigated in both text-dependent and text-independent ASV tasks. Conventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and the state-of-the-art x-vector are used to build ASV systems. Experimental results show that the voiceprint information in humming and singing speech are more distinguishable than that in normal reading speech for conventional ASV systems. Furthermore, we find that combing the three speaking styles can significantly improve the x-vector based ASV system, even when only limited gains are obtained by conventional GMM-based systems."
https://openalex.org/W3102349763,"3,3’-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is found in cruciferous vegetables and is used to treat various inflammatory diseases because of its potential anti-inflammatory effects. To investigate effects of DIM in Riemerella anatipestifer- infected ducks which induce upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, ducks were treated orally with DIM at dose of 200 mg/kg/day and infected the following day with R . anatipestifer . Infected and DIM-treated ducks exhibited 14% increased survival rate and significantly decreased bacterial burden compared to infected untreated ducks. Next, the effect on the expression level of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-17A, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-1β) of both in vitro and in vivo DIM-treated groups was monitored by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Generally, the expression levels of the cytokines were significantly reduced in DIM-treated splenic lymphocytes stimulated with killed R . anatipestifer compared to stimulated untreated splenic lymphocytes. Similarly, the expression levels of the cytokines were significantly reduced in the spleens and livers of DIM-treated R . anatipestifer –infected ducks compared to infected untreated ducks. This study demonstrated the ameliorative effects of DIM in ducks infected with R . anatipestifer . Thus, DIM can potentially be used to prevent and/or treat R . anatipestifer infection via inhibition of inflammatory cytokine expression."
