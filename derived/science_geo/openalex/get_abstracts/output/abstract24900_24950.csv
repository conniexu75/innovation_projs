Chem. 257, 1392-1397) has been cloned and sequenced. Analysis of the derived amino acid sequence suggests that the protein contains four domains: a signal sequence, a catalytic domain, a serine/threonine-rich region, and a carboxyl-terminal domain with high binding affinity for chitin. Most of the enzyme produced by cells is secreted into the growth medium and is extensively glycosylated with a series of short O-linked mannose oligosaccharides ranging in size from Man2 to Man5. Chitinase O-mannosylation was further examined in the temperature-sensitive secretion mutants sec18, sec7, and sec6. Oligosaccharides isolated from chitinase accumulating in cells at the nonpermissive temperature revealed Man1 and Man2 associated with the sec18 mutant. sec6 and sec7 accumulated Man2-Man5 with a higher proportion of Man5 relative to the secreted protein. A significant amount of chitinase is also found associated with the cell wall through binding of COOH-terminal domain to chitin. Disruption of the gene for the enzyme leads to a defect in cell separation but does not substantially alter the level of cellular chitin."
https://openalex.org/W1498310106,"GTP phosphorylation of rough microsomes in vitro is limited to four integral membrane proteins. Two of these, a phosphoprotein (pp90) and a phosphoglycoprotein (pgp35) were purified as a complex with two nonphosphorylated membrane glycoproteins, gp25H and gp25L. The authenticity of this complex was confirmed using two different purification procedures and by coimmunoprecipitation. By immunofluorescence a reticulated cytoplasmic network was revealed for the proteins which was similar to that for Louvard et al. (Louvard, D., Reggio, H., and Warren, G. (1982) J. Cell Biol. 92, 92-107) marker antisera which also recognized purified pp90 on immunoblots. Amino acid sequencing of peptides derived from pgp35 identified this protein as SSR alpha, an endoplasmic reticulum constituent as identified by cross-linking of translocating nascent chains (Gorlich, D, Prehn, S., Hartmann, E., Herz, J., Otto, A., Kraft, R., Wiedmann, M., Knespel, S., Dobberstein, B., and Rapoport, T. A. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 2283-2294). The sequence of gp25H was determined from cDNA clones and was identical with SSR beta identified by Gorlich et al. (1990) as being tightly bound to SSR alpha. Sequencing of gp25L revealed no similarity of the deduced sequence with other proteins. However, pp90 revealed a high degree of sequence identity with the Ca(2+)-binding protein, calreticulin. 45Ca2+ overlay studies indicated that pp90 bound Ca2+ and the name calnexin is proposed. Surprisingly, pgp25 (SSR alpha) also bound Ca2+ although gp25H (SSR beta) and gp25L did not. Triton X-114 partitioning of the integral membrane proteins of rough microsomes suggested that pgp35 (SSR alpha) and calnexin were major Ca(2+)-binding proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We propose that the function of the complex is to regulate Ca(2+)-dependent retention mechanisms for luminal proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1542029261,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin is implicated as the bacterial product responsible for the clinical syndrome of Gram-negative septicemia. Although the lipid A domain of LPS appears to be responsible for the toxicity of endotoxin, lipid A from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RSLA) and a disaccharide precursor of lipid A from enteric bacteria, termed lipid IVA, have little activity on human cells. Using the human promonomyelocytic cell line THP-1 and human monocytic cells, we now show that both lipid IVA and RSLA are antagonists of LPS. Complete, apparently competitive, inhibition of LPS activity is possible at a 10-100-fold excess of antagonist, as judged by measuring the release of cytokines and prostaglandin E2. Both antagonists prevent monocyte stimulation by endotoxin extracted from a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. Cells pretreated with either inhibitor and subsequently washed still show attenuated responses to LPS. Stimulation of monocytes by whole Gram-negative bacteria is also antagonized in a dose-dependent manner. Lipid X has no inhibitory effect in the same dose range as lipid IVA and RSLA. These findings rule out LPS sequestration as the explanation for the observed antagonism. Neither inhibitor alters monocyte stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, Staphylococcus aureus, or purified protein derivative, demonstrating specificity for LPS. Although RSLA appears to inhibit LPS when tested with macrophages from both humans and mice, lipid IVA had the unique ability to act as an LPS antagonist with human-derived cells but to exhibit LPS-like effects with murine-derived cells. Like LPS, lipid IVA stimulated the release of both tumor necrosis factor alpha and arachidonic acid from murine-derived RAW 264.7 macrophage tumor cells. The range of concentrations necessary for lipid IVA to induce LPS-like effects in murine cells was similar to that necessary to antagonize the actions of LPS in human monocytes. The agonist activities of lipid IVA were completely inhibitable by RSLA. This unique species-dependent pharmacology observed with lipid IVA may reflect differences between human and murine LPS receptors. RSLA and lipid IVA may be useful in defining the role of LPS in Gram-negative bacterial infections and may prove to be prototypical therapeutic agents for the treatment of Gram-negative septicemia."
https://openalex.org/W1587291838,"The capacity of cells of the human bronchial epithelium to express the gene for interleukin-8 (IL-8) was evaluated in bronchial epithelium derived cell lines, HS-24 and BET-1A, using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) as a model inflammatory stimulus. As in other epithelium, TNF markedly increased the level of the 1.8-kilobase IL-8 mRNA transcripts in both bronchial epithelial cell lines. In HS-24 cells, nuclear run-on analyses showed the IL-8 gene transcription rate was dramatically increased, more than 30-fold, after TNF stimulation. The half-life of IL-8 mRNA transcripts in these cells was approximately 40 min and did not change after TNF stimulation, suggesting that TNF up-regulated IL-8 gene expression mainly at the transcriptional level. DNase I hypersensitivity site mapping of chromatin DNA in resting HS-24 cells demonstrated two hypersensitivity sites within 400 base pairs (bp) 5' to exon I and one site within exon I. However, after TNF stimulation, the exon I hypersensitivity site disappeared and a new site approximately 120 bp 5' to exon I emerged. Consistent with these observations, transfection studies with HS-24 cells using fusion genes composed of the 5'-flanking sequences of the IL-8 gene and a luciferase reporter gene demonstrated potent promoter activity in a 174-bp segment (-130 to +44 relative to the transcription start site), which also exhibited a response to TNF, while a segment from -112 to +44 showed very low promoter activity and no response to TNF. Thus, human bronchial epithelial cells can express the IL-8 gene, with expression in response to the inflammatory mediator TNF regulated mainly at the transcriptional level, and with elements within the 5'-flanking region of the gene that are directly or indirectly modulated by the TNF signal."
https://openalex.org/W1518437590,"Acute regulation of steroidogenesis in steroidogenic tissue is controlled by the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane where cleavage to produce pregnenolone occurs. Hormonal stimulation of MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells results in a large increase in steroidogenesis and the concomitant appearance of a series of 30-kDa proteins which have been localized to the mitochondria. In the present study we have shown that the appearance of these proteins occurs in a dose-responsive manner with both human chorionic gonadotropin and cyclic AMP analog. We have also shown that while steroidogenesis is inhibited rapidly in response to a cessation of protein synthesis, the 30-kDa mitochondrial proteins remain in the mitochondria, posing a potential dilemma for arguments favoring their role in the acute regulation of steroidogenesis. We report that the 30-kDa mitochondrial proteins arise from two precursor proteins with molecular masses of 37 and 32 kDa which are also found to be associated with the mitochondria. The use of pulse-chase experiments and the inhibitors ortho-phenanthroline and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone demonstrated the precursor-product relationship between the 37-, 32-, and 30-kDa proteins. We have also demonstrated that, as shown for a number of other mitochondrial proteins, the 30-kDa proteins are transferred to the inner mitochondrial membrane by a process requiring both proteolytic removal of the targeting sequences and an electrical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane. We propose that during this transfer contact sites form between the two mitochondrial membranes and may offer an ideal situation for the transfer of cholesterol from the outer membrane to the inner membrane by an as yet unknown mechanism. Following transfer, the 30-kDa proteins remain in the inner membrane no longer able to function in the further transfer of cholesterol, and it is the continuing synthesis and processing of more precursor proteins which provides additional substrate for steroidogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1538532742,"The Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions at the cell surface to regulate epithelial cell recognition and adhesion. We have investigated the temporal and spatial regulation of uvomorulin biosynthesis and cell surface expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. We show that uvomorulin is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide (Mr 135,000) that is core glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The precursor is processed to the mature polypeptide (Mr 120,000) shortly after addition of complex carbohydrate groups in the late Golgi complex, but prior to delivery of the polypeptide to the cell surface. However, glycosylation is not required for either efficient processing of the precursor or transport of uvomorulin to the cell surface. At the cell surface, uvomorulin is turned over rapidly (t1/2 approximately 5 h). Induction of Ca(2+)-dependent cell-cell contact results in rapid localization of cell surface uvomorulin to regions of contact and an increase in the proportion of uvomorulin that is insoluble in buffers containing Triton X-100. These results indicate several regulatory steps in the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of uvomorulin in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1561903693,"Rabbit and human cDNA clones have been identified that encode a novel integrin beta subunit. The sequences that encode this subunit, which has been designated as beta 8, were isolated initially from rabbit placental cDNA libraries using an oligonucleotide probe derived from a highly conserved region of integrin beta subunit sequences. The rabbit clone was used to isolate human beta 8 cDNA clones from human placental and MG-63 osteosarcoma cell libraries. The putative beta 8 polypeptides, which comprise 769 and 768 residues in human and rabbit, respectively, show a high degree of inter-species conservation (approximately 90% identity). In contrast, beta 8 is distinct from the other integrin beta subunits. At the amino acid level human beta 8 ranges from 31 to 37% identity with human beta 1-7. The domain structure of beta 8 is typical of the integrin beta subunits. Human beta 8 has a 42-residue N-terminal signal peptide, a large extracellular domain (approximately 639 residues) that contains four cysteine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain (approximately 30 residues), and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (approximately 58 residues). There are several structural features that are unique to the beta 8 polypeptide, as compared with the other integrin beta subunits. Six of the 56 cysteine residues that are conserved within the extracellular domains of beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, beta 5, beta 6, and the beta subunit from Drosophila are absent in the beta 8 polypeptide. Also, the cytoplasmic domain of the beta 8 subunit shares no homology with the cytoplasmic regions of any of the other integrin beta subunits. Northern analysis demonstrated an approximately 8-kilobase beta 8 mRNA in rabbit placenta, kidney, brain, ovary, and uterus. PCR analysis revealed that beta 8 mRNA is also present in several transformed human cell lines. The beta 8 polypeptide has been transiently expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells. A polyclonal antipeptide antibody specific for beta 8 and a polyclonal antibody that recognizes alpha v epitopes were used to show that beta 8 can complex with the endogenous alpha v subunit in 293 cells and that the resulting integrin is expressed as a cell surface complex."
https://openalex.org/W1579500886,"Polyadenylation of messenger RNA precursors requires the nucleotide sequence AAUAAA and two factors: poly(A) polymerase and a specificity factor termed cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF). We have purified CPF from calf thymus and from HeLa cells to near homogeneity. Four polypeptides with molecular masses of 160, 100, 73, and 30 kDa cofractionate with CPF activity. Glycerol gradient centrifugation and gel filtration indicate that these four proteins form one large complex with a sedimentation constant of 12 S, a Stokes radius near 100 A, and a native molecular mass near 500 kDa. Purified CPF binds specifically to an RNA that contains the AAUAAA sequence. Mutation of the AAUAAA sequence inhibits CPF binding as well as polyadenylation. Purified CPF contains only trace amounts of RNA and does not react with antibodies against common epitopes of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles. Thus, contrary to previous indications, CPF does not appear to be a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle."
https://openalex.org/W1570507925,"Follistatin, an activin-binding protein secreted by cultured rat granulosa cells, was shown to associate with the cell surface by affinity labeling with 125I-activin. Addition of follistatin to the cultured cells demonstrated a typical ligand-binding saturation curve, suggesting that granulosa cells have a specific binding site for follistatin. This binding was markedly inhibited by heparin and heparan sulfate, but not by chondroitin sulfates A and C, keratan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. When granulosa cells were treated with glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes before or after addition of follistatin to the cultures, heparinase and heparitinase treatments resulted in significant suppression of the binding, whereas treatment with chondroitinase ABC had no effect. A competition study of the binding using heparin derivatives demonstrated that follistatin seemed to recognize O-sulfate groups in the heparin molecule. Heparitinase-treated granulosa cells exhibited almost full responsiveness to activin, indicating that the enzyme treatment had no effect on activin and receptor interaction. These results suggest that follistatin/activin-binding protein binds to heparan sulfate side chains of proteoglycans on the granulosa cell surface to regulate the various actions of activin."
https://openalex.org/W1547367445,"This report describes the cloning and characterization of rat leukocyte common antigen-related protein (rLAR), a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase). The recombinant cytoplasmic PTPase domain was expressed at high levels in bacteria and purified to homogeneity. Kinetic properties of the PTPase were examined along with potential modulators of PTPase activity. Several sulfhydryl-directed reagents were effective inhibitors, and a surprising distinction between iodoacetate and iodoacetamide was observed. The latter compound was an extremely poor inhibitor when compared to iodoacetate, suggesting that iodoacetate may interact selectively with a positive charge at or near the active site of the enzyme. Site-directed mutants were made at 4 highly conserved cysteine residues found at positions 1434, 1522, 1723, and 1813 within the protein. The Cys-1522/Ser mutation resulted in a 99% loss of enzymatic activity of the pure protein. This observation is consistent with greater than 99% of the PTPase activity being found in the first domain of the PTPase and demonstrates the critical importance of this cysteine residue in catalysis. The recombinant C1522S mutant phosphatase could also be phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C and p43v-abl tyrosine kinase. When pure recombinant PTPase was mixed with 32P-labeled tyrosine substrate and then rapidly denatured, a 32P-labeled enzyme intermediate could be trapped and visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The catalytically inactive C1522S mutant did not form the phosphoenzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1668754830,"Superoxide production by phagocytic blood cells involves assembly of an active NADPH oxidase complex from components found both in membrane and cytosolic locations in resting cells. We recently cloned cDNAs encoding two cytosolic components (p47-phox and p67-phox) of the oxidase that are deficient in distinct forms of autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease. The precise roles of p47-phox and p67-phox were explored further using purified factors produced in large quantities using recombinant baculoviruses to infect cultured Sf9 insect cells. Neither p47-phox nor p67-phox are thought to represent the flavoprotein components of the oxidase, since neither of the purified recombinant factors contained or bound FAD. Recombinant p47-phox and p67-phox are capable of restoring the deficient cytosol from chronic granulomatous disease patient neutrophils to nearly normal levels in a cell-free reconstitution system. Both p47-phox and p67-phox, used together in the absence of neutrophil cytosol, are incapable of supporting cell free production of superoxide, confirming the involvement of other soluble factor(s) in the assembly of an active oxidase in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1542751352,"Abstract Pyocin resistance in a strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been found to be associated with structural differences in the oligosaccharide moieties of the gonococcal outer membrane lipooligosaccharides (LOS). N. gonorrhoeae strain 1291 had been treated with several pyocins, usually lethal bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a series of surviving mutants were selected. The LOS of these pyocin-resistant mutants had altered electrophoretic mobilities in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Dudas, K. C., and Apicella, M. A. (1988) Infect. Immun. 56, 499-504). Structural analyses of the oligosaccharide portions of the wild-type (1291 wt) and five pyocin-resistant strains (1291a-e) by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry, tandem mass spectrometry, and methylation analysis revealed that four of the mutant strains make oligosaccharides that differ from the wild-type LOS by successive saccharide deletions (1291a,c-e) and, in the oligosaccharide of 1291b, by the addition of a terminal Gal to the 1291c structure. The composition, sequence, and linkages of the terminal tetrasaccharide of the wild-type LOS are the same as the lacto-N-neotetraose terminus of the human paragloboside (Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----3Gal beta 1----4Glc-ceramide), and both glycolipids bound the same monoclonal antibodies O6B4/3F11 that recognize this terminal epitope. None of the pyocin-resistant mutants bound this antibody. The 1291b LOS bound a monoclonal antibody that is specific for Gal alpha 1----4Gal beta 1----4Glc-ceramide (Pk glycosphingolipid) and shared a common composition, sequence, and linkages with this latter glycosphingolipid. Organisms that bound the anti-Pk monoclone occurred at the rate of approximately 1/750 among the wild-type parent strain. This structural information supports the conclusion that treatment with pyocin selects for mutants with truncated LOS structures and suggests that the oligosaccharides contained in the LOS of the wild-type strain and 1291b mimic those of human glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1542141332,"Abstract It is speculated that DNA polymerases which duplicate chromosomes are dimeric to provide concurrent replication of both leading and lagging strands. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme), is the 10-subunit replicase of the Escherichia coli chromosome. A complex of the alpha (DNA polymerase) and epsilon (3'-5' exonuclease) subunits of the holoenzyme contains only one of each protein. Presumably, one of the eight other subunit(s) functions to dimerize the alpha epsilon polymerase within the holoenzyme. Based on dimeric subassemblies of the holoenzyme, two subunits have been elected as possible agents of polymerase dimerization, one of which is the tau subunit (McHenry, C. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2657-2663). Here, we have used pure alpha, epsilon, and tau subunits in binding studies to determine whether tau can dimerize the polymerase. We find tau binds directly to alpha. Whereas alpha is monomeric, tau is a dimer in its native state and thereby serves as an efficient scaffold to dimerize the polymerase. The epsilon subunit does not associate directly with tau but becomes dimerized in the alpha epsilon tau complex by virtue of its interaction with alpha. We have analyzed the dimeric alpha epsilon tau complex by different physical methods to increase the confidence that this complex truly contains a dimeric polymerase. The tau subunit is comprised of the NH2-terminal two-thirds of tau but does not bind to alpha epsilon, identifying the COOH-terminal region of tau as essential to its polymerase dimerization function. The significance of these results with respect to the organization of subunits within the holoenzyme is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1523585998,"The requirements and influence of thiols on the production of nitric oxide (NO) were examined in cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells. NO production was diminished when cells were pretreated with thiol-depleting agents (IC50: N-ethylmaleimide, 30 microM; 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 200 microM; diamide, 1.5 mM; diethyl maleate, 20 mM). The depletion of glutathione (45-99% loss at the various IC50 values) and protein thiols (3-25% loss at IC50) showed no consistent relationship to decreased NO production. The effects of the agents on NO production were not linked to altered sensitivity to the stimulant (calcium ionophore A23187; maximal effect at 10 microM), but roughly paralleled the appearance of cell damage (17-44% lactate dehydrogenase release at IC50). The decrease in NO production due to 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was partially reversed by cysteine, dithioerythritol, and dihydrolipoate, whereas cystine partially reversed the decrease due to diamide or diethyl maleate. On the other hand, several thiols diminished NO production in control cells. Overall, alterations of NO production did not parallel the depletion or replenishment of either glutathione, protein thiol, or soluble thiol pools, and so the results argue against hypotheses that cellular thiols are either substrates or necessary cofactors in the pathway of NO synthesis in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1541917996,The general transcription factor TFIIA was purified from yeast. A key step in the purification was affinity chromatography using a column containing the adenovirus major late promoter with bound recombinant TFIID to which TFIIA binds with high affinity. TFIIA activity copurifies with two polypeptides of molecular mass 32 and 13.5 kDa. Elution and renaturation of these two polypeptides from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels showed that both polypeptides were required for TFIIA activity. TFIIA activity was measured by both a native gel shift assay and by in vitro complementation of transcription using yeast nuclear extracts depleted of TFIIA. The purified renatured yeast TFIIA also complements basal level transcription using a mammalian transcription system depleted of TFIIA. Native TFIIA has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa measured by gel filtration chromatography. TFIIA binds to a TFIID.TATA element.DNA complex with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 20 pM. This affinity is about 100-fold greater than the affinity of TFIID for TATA elements and much greater than the affinity of TFIIA for TFIID not bound to DNA.
https://openalex.org/W1584607623,"C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase is an exoenzyme produced by certain strains of Clostridium botulinum types C and D, which specifically ADP-ribosylates rho and rac proteins in eukaryotic cells. The enzyme was purified from a culture filtrate of C. botulinum type C strain 003-9, and the amino acid sequence from the amino-terminal Ser to Asn192 was determined by Edman degradation. Using a set of degenerate primers based on the sequence, we amplified a part of the gene for this enzyme by polymerase chain reaction. A 2.1-kilobase pair HincII fragment of C. botulinum DNA containing the whole structural gene was then identified by Southern analysis with the polymerase chain reaction product as a probe, and the complete nucleotide structure of the gene together with flanking regions was determined by cloning and DNA sequencing the HincII fragment. The gene encodes a protein of 244 amino acids with a Mr of 27,362 which begins with a putative signal peptide of 40 amino acids. Escherichia coli carrying this gene produced the active enzyme, and about 60% of it was found in the culture medium. Immunoblot analysis with antiserum against the enzyme revealed the presence of two immunoreactive proteins of 27 and 23 kDa in the cytoplasmic/membrane fraction and only the 23-kDa protein in the periplasm and the medium, suggesting that the enzyme expressed is processed in the E. coli, exported into the periplasm and released into the culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W1913100483,"Previously we had demonstrated by photoaffinity labeling that a 57-kDa protein of the endoplasmic reticulum can bind and become covalently linked to glycosylatable photoreactive peptides containing the sequence-Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr-. Subsequently, it was found that this protein, called glycosylation site-binding protein, was a multifunctional protein, i.e. it was identical to protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), the beta-subunit of prolyl hydroxylase and thyroid hormone-binding protein. In this study, the peptide specificity for binding to this 57-kDa protein, hereafter called PDI, has been investigated in more detail using photoaffinity probes. The results reveal that although N-glycosylation by oligosaccharyl transferase in the endoplasmic reticulum has an absolute requirement for an hydroxyamino acid in the third amino acid residue of the glycosylation site sequence, no such specificity is observed in the binding of such peptides to PDI. In addition to the lack of specificity for an hydroxyamino acid in the third residue position, no specificity was observed for the asparagine residue in the first position. Thus, binding is not restricted to peptides containing N-glycosylation sites. We have investigated the discrepancy between this apparent lack of sequence specificity and earlier results indicating that binding of peptides to PDI was specific for N-glycosylation site sequences. We now demonstrate that PDI in the lumen of microsomes is more efficiently labeled by peptides containing photoreactive-Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr- sequences than by nonacceptor site sequences because the former become glycosylated. This increased labeling does not occur because the glycosylated form of the probes are preferentially recognized by PDI. Rather, it appears that increased polarity of the affinity probe after attachment of the oligosaccharide chain prevents its exit from the sealed microsomes, in effect concentrating it within the lumen of the microsome. These results, coupled with other studies on the multifunctional nature of PDI, suggest that the observed peptide binding may be a manifestation of the ability of PDI to recognize the backbone of polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1607833248,"Proteolytic processing plays a fundamental role in gene expression of a recently characterized viral-like double-stranded RNA associated with biological control of the chestnut blight fungus. Polypeptide p29, a papain-like protease, was shown to autocatalytically release itself from the NH2 terminus of the polyprotein specified by the first of two encoded open reading frames, ORF A (Choi, G. H., Shapira, R., and Nuss, D. L. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 1167-1171; Choi, G. H., Pawlyk, D. M., and Nuss, D. L. (1991) Virology 183, 747-752). The characterization of a second autocatalytic protease, p48, which is encoded by ORF B, is the subject of this report. Deletion analysis revealed that the catalytic domain resides within the carboxyl-terminal region, while site-specific mutational analysis identified Cys-341 and His-388 as residues essential for autoproteolysis. Autoproteolytic processing by p48 was also demonstrated when expressed in Escherichia coli and microsequence analysis of the recovered COOH-terminal cleavage product indicated that cleavage occurred between Gly-418 and Ala-419. The requirements for a functional cleavage site, including confirmation of the cleavage dipeptide, were defined by amino acid substitution analysis. Similarities between p29 and p48 suggest that the respective coding domains could have arisen as a result of a gene duplication event."
https://openalex.org/W1549521080,"The major surface antigen of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei, the variant surface glycoprotein, is attached to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. The biosynthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, as well as the assembly of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains found on the variant surface glycoproteins, involves polyisoprenoid lipids that act as sugar carriers. Preliminary observations (Menon, A.K., Schwarz, R.T., Mayor, and Cross, G.A.M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 9033-9042) suggested that the sugar carriers in T. brucei were short-chain polyisoprenoids containing substantially fewer isoprene residues than polyisoprenols in mammalian cells. In this paper we describe metabolic labeling experiments with [3H]mevalonate, as well as chromatographic and mass spectrometric analyses of products of the mevalonate pathway in T. brucei. We report that cells of the bloodstream form of T. brucei contain a limited spectrum of short chain dolichols and dolichol phosphates (11 and 12 isoprene residues). The total dolichol content was estimated to be 0.28 nmol/10(9) cells; the dolichyl phosphate content was 0.07 nmol/10(9) cells. The same spectrum of dolichol chain lengths was also found in a polar lipid that could be labeled with [3H]mevalonate, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]mannose, and which was characterized as Man5GlcNAc2-PP-dolichol. The most abundant product of the mevalonate pathway identified in T. brucei was cholesterol (140 nmol/10(9) cells). Ubiquinone (0.09 nmol/10(9) cells) with a solanesol side chain was also identified."
https://openalex.org/W1674222082,"The alternative sigma factor sigma 54 of enteric bacteria, or its homologue in other purple bacteria, is required for transcription of genes whose products have diverse physiological roles. Previous studies have indicated that sigma 54 confers on core RNA polymerase the ability to recognize a specific class of promoters but not the ability to isomerize from closed to open complexes. Isomerization requires ATP and one member of a family of activator proteins, it being different activator proteins that allow this form of polymerase to respond to different physiological signals. We have developed a strategy for overproducing and purifying sigma 54 from Salmonella typhimurium and have studied several biochemical properties of reconstituted sigma 54-holoenzyme. The initial binding constant KB for the formation of closed complexes between this holoenzyme and the ginA promoter in our transcription buffer is approximately 3 x 10(8) M-1, which was determined from DNaseI protection assays at 37 degrees C. After the formation of open complexes, several properties of sigma 54-holoenzyme appear to be similar to those of sigma 70-holoenzyme. We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding sigma 54 (ntrA) in Salmonella."
https://openalex.org/W1530326522,"We have characterized a maltodextrin glucosidase, previously described as a maltose-inducible, cytoplasmic enzyme that cleaves p-nitrophenyl-alpha-maltoside in Escherichia coli. The gene encoding the enzyme activity, referred to as malZ, is located at 9.3 min on the chromosomal map. We cloned the gene in a high copy number vector and purified the enzyme. It is a monomer, with an apparent molecular weight of 65,000. The enzyme degrades maltodextrins, ranging from maltotriose to maltoheptaose, to shorter oligosaccharides, the final hydrolysis products being maltose and glucose. We measured the kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, for the hydrolysis to glucose of the five different substrates. The binding of the substrate is enhanced by increasing the number of glucosyl residues in the maltodextrin. In contrast, the maximum rate of hydrolysis (Vmax) is fastest for maltotriose. To study the mode of action of the enzyme, we quantitatively measured the amount of free glucose liberated from the different maltodextrin substrates after a long incubation. More glucose is liberated from the long dextrins, as compared to the shorter ones, showing that the primary hydrolysis product was glucose, not maltose. Furthermore, [14C]maltotriose, specifically labeled at the reducing end, was hydrolyzed to [14C]glucose and unlabeled maltose. These data demonstrate that the malZ gene product is a maltodextrin glucosidase, liberating glucose from the reducing end of malto-oligosaccharides. The nucleotide sequence of malZ and the deduced amino acid sequence showed that malZ encodes a protein with a molecular weight of 68,960. Homology to glucosidases, alpha-amylases, and pullulanases were observed. Conserved regions thought to represent active sites in dextrin hydrolases were found in the MalZ protein."
https://openalex.org/W1583654353,"Receptors in the thyroid-steroid hormone superfamily bind preferentially as dimers to palindromic response elements containing two hexameric half-sites. The 23-base pair rat growth hormone (rGH) T3 response element (T3RE), however, contains three hexameric binding domains, all of which are required for maximal T3 response. We examined the binding of purified T3 receptor alpha (T3R alpha), overexpressed in Escherichia coli, to wild-type and up and down mutations of the rGH T3RE to evaluate whether transcriptional potency correlates with changes in T3R binding. T3R binds to the rGH T3RE as a monomer, dimer, or higher order oligomer. Cooperative T3R dimer binding was demonstrated to two hexameric domains of the rGH T3RE arranged as either direct or inverted repeats. Decreased binding was seen with point mutations in each domain as well as with mutations which altered hexamer orientation and spacing within the site. These results demonstrate that all three hexamers of the rGH T3RE are involved in binding T3R. Occupancy of all three hexamers by T3R in the gel shift assay was observed with functional up mutations of the T3RE, increasing receptor concentration or addition of nuclear extract. The transcriptional response potencies of T3RE up or down mutants in a transient transfection assay correlated closely with T3R binding. These results confirm our earlier hypothesis that all three hexamers of the rGH T3RE bind T3R in a novel binding arrangement and provide a model for the interaction of T3R and other nuclear proteins with the DNA sequences of thyroid hormone-regulated genes."
https://openalex.org/W1513067523,"Complementary DNAs encoding the beta subunit of casein kinase II (CKII beta) from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were cloned and sequenced. The predicted beta subunit polypeptide comprises 234 amino acid residues and has a Mr of 26,452. CKII beta is not homologous with other types of proteins. In synchronously developing C. elegans the abundance of the 1.3-kilobase mRNA for CKII beta varies in parallel with the level of mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit (alpha) of CKII. Thus, the developmental expression of CKII subunits is controlled coordinately and pretranslationally. CKII beta and CKII alpha mRNAs are enriched 5-10-fold in C. elegans embryos relative to their concentrations at several other stages of nematode development. A 3.8-kilobase pair segment of C. elegans DNA that contains the CKII beta gene and an extensive 5'-flanking region was cloned and sequenced. The CKII beta gene is divided into 6 exons by introns ranging from 49 to 533 base pairs in length. The first exon encodes 88 nucleotides of 5'-untranslated mRNA. Exon 2 (72 base pairs) contains the initiator Met codon and only 5 additional codons. Exons 3-6 encode 52, 63, 64, and 49 amino acid residues, respectively. The 5' terminus of CKII beta mRNA is modified post-transcriptionally by trans-splicing with a leader sequence of 22 nucleotides. The CKII beta gene was mapped to a position on C. elegans chromosome 2 that is in close proximity to the lin-11 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1858494250,"Previous studies suggest that regulation of hexose uptake in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts can occur by alterations in glucose transporter intrinsic activity without changes in cell surface transporter number (Harrison, S. A., Buxton, J. M., Helgerson, A. L., MacDonald, R. G., Chlapowski, F. J., Carruthers, A., and Czech, M. P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5793-5801). We tested this hypothesis using 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes which exhibit 5-6-fold increases in 2-deoxyglucose or 3-O-methylglucose uptake when exposed to low micromolar concentrations of cadmium for 18 h. Cadmium treatment decreased the apparent Km of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts for 3-O-methylglucose influx from approximately 28 to 9 mM and increased the apparent Vmax by 2-3-fold. These fibroblasts lack the skeletal muscle/adipocyte-type (GLUT4) transporter and showed only a small increase in total cellular immunoreactive HepG2 type (GLUT1) transporter in response to cadmium. Furthermore, cell surface GLUT1 levels did not change in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts exposed to cadmium, as assessed by the binding to intact cells of an antibody which recognizes an extracellular GLUT1 epitope. Insulin enhanced 2-deoxyglucose uptake 2-fold in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, but did not further stimulate cadmium-activated transport rates. In contrast, insulin stimulated hexose transport 15-fold in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which express both GLUT1 and GLUT4 proteins, and this effect was fully additive with the 5-fold effect of cadmium. Cadmium had little or no effect on immunoreactive GLUT1 or GLUT4 in isolated 3T3-L1 adipocyte plasma membranes. In contrast, insulin action led to marked recruitment (3-fold) of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane fraction in adipocytes treated with or without cadmium. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that cadmium-activated sugar uptake is catalyzed by GLUT1, whereas insulin-stimulated sugar uptake is catalyzed predominantly by GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, the data suggest that the GLUT1 transporter can undergo significant increases in intrinsic catalytic activity in response to cadmium treatment of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1485753434,"The 8- and 31-kDa fragments of beta-polymerase, prepared by controlled proteolysis as described (Kumar, A., Widen, S. G., Williams, K. R., Kedar, P., Karpel, R. L., and Wilson, S. H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2124-2131), constitute domains that are structurally and functionally dissimilar. There is little disruption of secondary structure upon proteolysis of the intact enzyme, as suggested from CD spectra of the fragments. beta-Polymerase is capable of binding both single- and double-stranded nucleic acids: the 8-kDa fragment binds specifically to single-stranded lattices, whereas the 31-kDa domain displays affinity exclusively for double-stranded polynucleotides. These domains are connected by a highly flexible protease-hypersensitive segment that may allow the coordinate functioning of the two binding activities in the intact protein. beta-Polymerase binds to poly(ethenoadenylic acid) with higher affinity, similar cooperativity, but lesser salt dependence than the 8-kDa fragment. Under physiological conditions, the intact enzyme displays greater binding free energy for single-stranded polynucleotides than the 8-kDa fragment, suggesting that the latter may carry a truncated binding site. Binding of double-stranded calf thymus DNA brings about a moderate quenching of the Tyr and Trp fluorescence emission of both the 31-kDa fragment and beta-polymerase and induces a 6-nm blue shift in the Trp emission maximum of the intact enzyme, but not in the fragment. This latter result is likely due to a change in the relative orientation of the 8- and 31-kDa domains in the intact protein upon interaction with double-stranded DNA; alternatively, the binding mode of intact protein may differ from that of the fragment. Simultaneous interaction of both domains with polynucleotides most likely does not occur since double-stranded DNA binding to the 31-kDa domain of intact beta-polymerase induces the displacement of single-stranded polynucleotides from the 8-kDa domain. These results are evaluated in light of the role of beta-polymerase in DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1490416467,"Proteinase A obtained from the culture medium of Aspergillus niger var. macrosporus is a unique acid endopeptidase that is insensitive (or less sensitive) to specific inhibitors of ordinary acid or aspartic proteinases, such as pepstatin, diazoacetyl-DL-norleucine methyl ester, and 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)-propane. In the preceding paper (Takahashi, K., Inoue, H., Sakai, K., Kohama, T., Kitahara, S., Takishima, K., Tanji, M., Athauda, S. B. P., Takahashi, T., Akanuma, H., Mamiya, G., Yamasaki, M. J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19480-19483), we reported the complete primary structure of the mature enzyme determined at the protein level. The enzyme has a unique two-chain structure with a 39-residue light (L) chain and a 173-residue heavy (H) chain linked noncovalently. As an extension of this study, we isolated genomic and cDNA clones encoding this proteinase and determined their nucleotide sequences. To isolate a genomic clone, the genomic DNA was selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction using mixed oligonucleotide primers designed from the amino acid sequence of the H chain, and a specific probe thus generated was used for screening a lambda gt10 genomic library. A cDNA for the enzyme was also selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers synthesized based on the sequence of the genomic DNA. Sequencing of the cloned genomic DNA and cDNA revealed the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene for the enzyme of 846 base pairs without introns. It encodes the precursor form of proteinase A, including an NH2-terminal preprosequence of 59 residues, the L chain of 39 residues, an intervening sequence of 11 residues, and the H chain of 173 residues linked in that order. Thus, proteinase A is thought to be synthesized as a single peptide chain preproenzyme of 282 residues, which is processed to generate the mature two-chain form."
https://openalex.org/W1556008944,"Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a ubiquitous and multifunctional polypeptide that is believed to have a role in tissue repair and to act as a morphogen in embryonic development. Here, we have used immunohistochemical and biochemical methods with antibodies directed against the amino-terminal domain of bFGF, designated IS2, which recognize native and denatured bFGF, to demonstrate that in addition to its known intracellular and extracellular localization in heart, bFGF is also associated with cardiomyocyte gap junctions. In tissue sections, IS2 labeled regions of intercalated discs, producing an immunofluorescence pattern virtually indistinguishable from that obtained with antibodies against the heart gap junction protein connexin-43. By electron microscopy, gap junctions but not other regions of plasma membrane were heavily immunolabeled with this antibody. By solid phase immunoassay, bFGF was found to be more concentrated in a fraction enriched in cardiac gap junctions than in whole sarcolemmal preparations. Finally, an 18-kDa protein was recognized by several different antibodies specific for bFGF on Western blots of heart subcellular fractions enriched in gap junctions. We suggest that bFGF-like peptides are either an integral part of, or exist in close association with, cardiac gap junctions and thus may play a role in modulating gap junctional intercellular communication."
https://openalex.org/W1566184911,"The baculovirus expression system was used to generate recombinant Alzheimer's amyloid precursor (AAP) proteins. Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed, designed to express full-length 695-, 751-, and 770-amino acid forms. Recombinant baculoviruses designed for constitutive secretion were engineered by placing a termination codon between the beta-protein domain and cytoplasmic anchor of the full-length forms. Insect cells infected with each of these baculoviruses produced both secreted and cell-associated AAPs. Full-length constructs produced secreted derivatives which were COOH-terminally cleaved within the beta-protein domain at Gln15 or Lys16, essentially identical to previous reports utilizing mammalian cell systems. Rare secreted forms (less than 5%) appeared to extend to Lys28. Secretion constructs produced these same forms, but in different ratios. Most (approximately 60%) terminated at Gln15 or Lys16, while the remainder apparently extended to Lys28. AAPs containing the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitory domain (AAP-751 and -770) were shown to be active inhibitors. No differences were observed in the inhibitors activities of these two forms. The similarities in AAP processing by insect and mammalian systems, together with the large amounts of recombinant protein produced by baculovirus expression, make this an attractive system for studies of AAP processing and biochemical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1601349651,"Low density lipoproteins (LDL) are large (Mr = 2.5 x 10(6)) in comparison to LDL receptors (Mr = 115,000). Since most LDL receptors are clustered in coated pits, we tested the hypothesis that crowding of receptor-bound LDL particles would cause steric effects. The apparent affinity of LDL for receptors on cultured fibroblasts decreased near saturation causing concave-upward Scatchard plots. Both the higher and lower affinity components of binding were up-regulated by the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, lovastatin, indicating that the entire binding curve was sterol-responsive. In contrast, neither component of LDL binding was present on lovastatin-treated or untreated null fibroblasts which are incapable of expressing LDL receptors. Therefore, the concave-upward Scatchard plots were entirely due to binding to LDL receptors. These results are consistent with a lattice model in which receptor-bound LDL are large enough to decrease binding to adjacent receptors. A lattice model implies that large LDL should produce steric effects at a lower receptor occupancy than should small LDL. This was tested using seven LDL fractions that differed in diameter from 20 to 27 nm. Fewer large than small LDL were bound to the cell surface at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C, and fewer were internalized and degraded at 37 degrees C. Since large LDL bound via both apolipoprotein (apo) E and apoB100, receptor cross-linking could have caused fewer large LDL to be bound at saturation. However, when the potential for cross-linking was prevented by an apo-E-specific monoclonal antibody (1D7), the difference in binding by large versus small LDL was not eliminated; instead, it was exaggerated. Taken together, these results support a lattice model for LDL binding and indicate that steric hindrance associated with crowding of LDL particles on receptor lattices is a major determinant for catabolism by the LDL receptor pathway in vitro."

To detect the xpac protein in cells, we raised antibody against a recombinant human xpac protein. Using this antibody, we identified the xpac protein in the nucleus of cells. In normal human cells, 40- and 38-kDa proteins were detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A reduced amount of the smaller protein was detected in XP 39OSSV cells, which show low UV sensitivity, and no xpac proteins were detected in XP 2OSSV cells, which show high UV sensitivity. These levels of xpac proteins in xeroderma pigmentosum cells were determinants of heterogeneity of the DNA repair defect in group A xeroderma pigmentosum. Synthesis of the xpac protein did not increase after UV irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1540013552,"Abstract The four human glycoprotein hormones are heterodimers that contain a common alpha subunit and a hormone-specific beta subunit. Within this hormone family, 23 amino acid sequences from 11 mammalian species are available. There are 19 invariant amino acid residues in the beta subunits, 12 of which are Cys that form six disulfide bonds. Of the remaining seven conserved amino acid residues, we have investigated the role of an Asp which occurs at position 99 in human choriogonadotropin beta (hCG beta). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace hCG beta Asp99 with three residues, Glu, Asn, and Arg, and to prepare an inversion double mutant protein, Arg94----Asp and Asp99----Arg. The cDNAs were placed in a eukaryotic expression vector, and the plasmids were transiently transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a stably integrated gene for bovine alpha. Radioimmunoassays demonstrated that the mutant forms of hCG beta were capable of subunit assembly to the same extent as hCG beta wild type. The heterologous heterodimers were assayed in vitro using transformed mouse Leydig cells (MA-10) by competitive inhibition of 125I-hCG binding and stimulation of progesterone production. The gonadotropins containing Glu and Asn were active, although the potency was less than that associated with the hCG beta wild type-containing gonadotropin. In contrast, the Arg99-containing mutant protein and the inversion mutant protein Asp94/Arg99 were devoid of activity. Thus, in hCG beta Asp99 can be substituted with certain residues without total loss of function, although replacement with a positively charged residue leads to an inactive heterodimer. The primary role of Asp99 in hCG beta seems to involve, either directly or indirectly, receptor recognition."

K12G0S32, secreted by infected Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells at a rate of 1.5 micrograms/10(6) cells/48 h, was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. It was obtained essentially as a single-chain molecule with a Ka = 5.5 x 10(9) M-1 for immobilized fragment D-dimer, similar to that of MA-15C5. The specific activity of both its single-chain and two-chain forms on fibrin plates was 100,000 IU/mg of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) equivalent. Activation of plasminogen by two-chain K12G0S32 obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km = 2.9 +/- 0.6 microM and a k2 = 3.7 +/- 0.6 s-1 (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3), as compared to Km = 12 microM and k2 = 4.8 s-1 for rtcu-PA-32k (recombinant low Mr two-chain u-PA consisting of amino acids Leu144 to Leu411). Single-chain K12G0S32 induced a dose- and time-dependent lysis of a 125I-fibrin-labeled human plasma clot immersed in citrated human plasma; 50% lysis in 2 h was obtained with 0.70 +/- 0.07 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D.; n = 5), as compared with 8.8 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml for rscu-PA-32k (recombinant low Mr single-chain u-PA consisting of amino acids Leu144 to Leu411) (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3). With two-chain K12G0S32, 50% clot lysis in 2 h required 0.25 +/- 0.03 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D.; n = 3), as compared with only 0.62 +/- 0.04 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D.; n = 2) for rtcu-PA-32k. These results indicate that low Mr single-chain u-PA can be targeted to a fibrin clot with a single-chain Fv fragment of a fibrin-specific antibody, resulting in a 13-fold increase of the fibrinolytic potency of the single-chain form and a 2.5-fold increase of the potency of the two-chain form."
https://openalex.org/W1527688425,"Each of the two beta peptides which comprise the B2 protein of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase (RRB2) possesses a nonheme dinuclear iron cluster and a tyrosine residue at position 122. The oxidized form of the protein contains all high spin ferric iron and 1.0-1.4 tyrosyl radicals per RRB2 protein. In order to define the stoichiometry of in vitro dioxygen reduction catalyzed by fully reduced RRB2 we have quantified the reactants and products in the aerobic addition of Fe(II) to metal-free RRB2apo utilizing an oxygraph to quantify oxygen consumption, electron paramagnetic resonance to measure tyrosine radical generation, and Mossbauer spectroscopy to determine the extent of iron oxidation. Our data indicate that 3.1 Fe(II) and 0.8 Tyr122 are oxidized per mol of O2 reduced. Mossbauer experiments indicate that less than 8% of the iron is bound as mononuclear high spin Fe(III). Further, the aerobic addition of substoichiometric amounts of 57Fe to RRB2apo consistently produces dinuclear clusters, rather than mononuclear Fe(III) species, providing the first direct spectroscopic evidence for the preferential formation of the dinuclear units at the active site. These stoichiometry studies were extended to include the phenylalanine mutant protein (Y122F)RRB2 and show that 3.9 mol-equivalents of Fe(II) are oxidized per mol of O2 consumed. Our stoichiometry data has led us to propose a model for dioxygen activation catalyzed by RRB2 which invokes electron transfer between iron clusters."
https://openalex.org/W1565268763,"The reactions of cytochromes P450 IA1, IIB1, IIB2, and IIE1 with phenyldiazene yield complexes with absorption maxima at either 474 or 480 nm. Anaerobic extraction of the prosthetic group from the phenyldiazene-treated proteins followed by its exposure to oxygen and strong acid produces an equal mixture of the four possible N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX regioisomers. Exposure of the anaerobically extracted heme complexes to oxygen in the absence of strong acid results in their decomposition to heme and products other than N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX. These results show that the 474/480 nm absorption maxima are due to sigma phenyl-iron complexes. Treatment of the intact hepatic cytochrome P450 complexes with K3Fe(CN)6 results in disappearance of the 474/480 nm band. Extraction of the prosthetic group then yields only the two N-phenylprotoporphyrin IX regioisomers with the N-phenyl group on pyrrole rings A and D. The same regioisomer pattern is obtained if the cytochrome P450IA1 phenyl-iron complex is simply warmed to 37 degrees C, but this thermal rearrangement occurs much less readily, if at all, with the complexes of the other isozymes. The regioisomers with the N-phenyl on pyrrole rings A and D are obtained in a 2:1 ratio with isozyme IA1, 1:1 with IIB2, 1:1.7 with IIB1, and 1:2 with IIE1. These results establish that the active sites of these cytochrome P450 isozymes have a common architecture despite their gross differences in substrate specificity. In this architecture, the region directly above pyrrole rings A and D is relatively open whereas that above pyrrole rings B and C is occluded by protein residues."
https://openalex.org/W1609750217,"The complete amino acid sequence of the acid proteinase A, a non-pepsin type acid proteinase from the fungus Aspergillus niger var. macrosporus, was determined by protein sequencing. The enzyme was first dissociated at pH 8.5 into a light (L) chain and a heavy (H) chain, and the L chain was sequenced completely. Further sequencing was performed with the reduced and pyridylethylated or aminoethylated derivative of the whole protein, using peptides obtained by digestions with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lysylendopeptidase. The location of the two disulfide bonds was determined by analysis of cystine-containing peptides obtained from a chymotryptic digest of the unmodified protein. These results established that the protein consists of a 39-residue L chain and a 173-residue H chain that associate noncovalently to form the native enzyme of 212 residues (Mr 22,265). This is, to our knowledge, the first time that such a protein with a rather short peptide chain associated noncovalently has been found. No sequence homology is found with other acid or aspartic proteinases, except for Scytalidium lignicolum acid proteinase B, an enzyme unrelated to pepsin by sequence, which has about 50% identity with the present enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W1570309672,"We isolated avian (chicken and quail) cardiac troponin I (TnIcardiac) cDNA clones for studies of Tn-Icardiac protein structure/evolution and developmental gene regulation. Comparison of the cDNA-predicted avian TnIcardiac amino acid sequences with known TnI sequences indicated 1) that the presence of an N-terminal extension sequence carrying a dual protein kinase A phosphorylation target site and an adjacent proline-rich segment is an ancient cardiac-specific feature of TnI which has been conserved since the bird/mammal divergence, 2) that features of the near-N-terminal troponin C (TnC)-binding site sequence suggest isoform-specific adaptation of TnI and TnC, and 3) that the avian TnIcardiac internal actin/TnC-binding, actomyosin-inhibitory, domain shows significant sequence divergence from mammalian TnIcardiac sequences, including the absence of a protein kinase C target site which is a cardiac-specific feature of TnI in mammals. Use of the cDNA clones to probe TnIcardiac mRNA expression during striated muscle development showed active expression in cardiac muscle from early developmental times (day 4 in ovo), but not in embryonic or adult skeletal muscle or in embryonic skeletal muscle cell cultures. Transcriptional run-on analysis showed that the heart-specific expression of TnIcardiac mRNA in embryonic striated muscle reflects transcriptional control of TnIcardiac gene expression. In many other contractile protein gene families, genes encoding cardiac isoforms are expressed early in skeletal muscle development and are later repressed. Thus, the restriction of active TnIcardiac gene expression to the cardiac muscle cell lineage is an unusual expression pattern for cardiac contractile protein genes and indicates that diverse gene regulatory mechanisms direct the differential expression of cardiac and skeletal muscle isoforms in different muscle gene families."

Partial amino acid sequence analysis of purified PRECE and cloning and sequence analyses of its cDNA indicated that it is identical to the mGK-13 gene product, epidermal growth factor-binding protein type B, which is a member of the glandular kallikrein family and is involved in maturation of epidermal growth factor.

https://openalex.org/W1484377079,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a Gram-negative bacterial glycolipid that is believed to cause, by virtue of its stimulatory actions on macrophages and other eukaryotic cells, the life-threatening symptoms associated with Gram-negative infections. Macrophages both respond to and catabolically deactivate LPS. The lipid A moiety of LPS is responsible for the stimulatory actions of LPS on macrophages. We have previously developed methods employing a radiolabeled bioactive lipid A precursor, 4'-32P-lipid IVA, to study the interaction of this class of lipids with animal cells (Hampton, R. Y., Golenbock, D. T., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1988). J. Biol. Chem. 263, 14802-14807). In the current work, we have examined the uptake and catabolism of 4'-32P-lipid IVA by the RAW 264.7 cell line in serum-containing medium at physiological temperatures and have studied the effect of LPS stimulation on the ability of these cells to catabolize lipid IVA. RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells avidly take up 4'-32P-lipid IVA under cell culture conditions at nanomolar concentrations. Uptake of lipid IVA was accompanied by lysosomal dephosphorylation of a fraction of the lipid to yield 4'-monophosphoryl lipid IVA. Chemically generated 4'-monophosphoryl lipid IVA was found to be substantially less bioactive than lipid IVA in the RAW cell, indicating that this catabolic dephosphorylation results in detoxification. In uptake experiments of 3-4 h duration, all metabolism of lipid IVA is blocked by ligands of the macrophage scavenger receptor. In longer experiments (24 h), both scavenger receptor-dependent and -independent uptake are responsible for the lysosomal catabolism of lipid IVA. Preincubation of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS caused dose-dependent inhibition of lipid IVA dephosphorylation. Sufficient LPS stimulation resulted in essentially complete inhibition of lipid IVA catabolism in both short- and long-term uptake experiments. This effect occurred at physiologically relevant concentrations of LPS (IC50 less than 1 ng/ml), and our data indicate that LPS-induced blockade of lipid IVA catabolism was due to the resultant physiological stimulation of the cells, and not inhibition of dephosphorylation by competition for uptake or enzymatic sites or by simple sequestration of labeled lipid IVA by LPS aggregates. We suggest that in the macrophage, LPS can modulate its own catabolism by virtue of its pharmacological properties. This effect of LPS could play a role in LPS pathophysiology as well as in macrophage biology."
https://openalex.org/W1492827747,"Hydrogen peroxide reacts with two-electron reduced glutathione reductase (GR EH2 species) to give the native oxidized enzyme (E) without detectable intermediates. Prior alkylation of the EH2 interchange thiol with iodoacetamide, however, dramatically changes both the course and overall rate of the peroxide reaction. This oxidation, monitored spectrally, is characterized by an intermediate (EHRint) with enhanced long wavelength absorbance extending to 800 nm. This species decays in a second peroxide-dependent phase to an enzyme form (EHRox) easily distinguished from E. Quenching experiments with catalase allow the isolation of a stable mixture consisting of 36% monoalkylated GR (EHR), 60% EHRint, and 4% EHRox; NADPH titration and anaerobic dithiothreitol addition lead to quantitative reduction of EHRint to EHR, and there is an increase in thiol titer of 0.8-SH/FAD on NADPH reduction. Of the four titratable thiols present in EHR, 2.7 are lost on oxidation to EHRox and 0.7-0.8 mol of cysteic acid/FAD is formed. On the basis of these and other observations, we conclude that alkylation of the EH2 interchange thiol, which blocks disulfide formation, allows peroxide reaction at the remaining charge-transfer thiol to proceed via a stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid intermediate (EHRint), which undergoes further oxidation to the corresponding cysteic acid (EHRox)."
https://openalex.org/W1557726566,"To test the proposition that a histidine residue is essential in the catalytic mechanism of glutathione S-transferase, rat liver isoenzyme 3-3 specifically labeled with [ring-2-13C]histidine was prepared. The 13C NMR spectrum of the labeled enzyme revealed four resonances corresponding to the 4 histidine residues in the mu gene class type 3 subunit. Titration of the four resonances in the range of pH 4-9 both in the presence and absence of glutathione gave pK alpha values of much less than 4, 5.2, 7.1, and 7.8 for the four side chains that were identified by site-specific mutagenesis as His14, His83, His84, and His167, respectively. The magnetic resonance properties and titration behavior of His14 suggest that this residue is buried in a hydrophobic environment. Conservative replacement of each histidine with asparagine results in mutant enzymes that have catalytic properties very close to the native protein as assessed with three different substrates, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, and phenanthrene 9,10-oxide. The results indicate clearly that none of the histidine residues of isoenzyme 3-3 is essential for stabilization of the bound glutathione thiolate or for any other aspect of catalysis."

Cells resistant to G418 (a neomycin synthetic analog) were analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter to isolate a homogeneous population of cells which stably expressed NEP at their surface. When cells grown in Petri dishes were labeled with an antibody to NEP coupled to colloidal gold and examined under the electron microscope, a strong labeling of microvilli was observed, whereas very few particles were present on the basolateral domain, suggesting that the polarized distribution of this enzyme typical of proximal tubule cells is maintained in this MDCK cell population. To study more accurately the mechanism by which MDCK cells target NEP to the apical surface, cultures were grown to confluence on Costar Transwell chambers and used for pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine. Immunoprecipitation of recombinant NEP was then performed by adding an anti-NEP polyclonal antibody to the apical or basolateral surface of intact monolayers and by analyzing immunoprecipitates by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Our results suggest that NEP is delivered directly to the apical domain and does not transit through the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane. This NEP-expressing MDCK cell line therefore constitutes a new model for investigating the molecular basis of apical membrane targeting in polarized epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1609927002,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to insert cysteine residues at specific locations in the myosin light chain 2 (LC2) sequence. The aim was to modify these cysteines with one or more spectroscopic probes and to reconstitute myosin with labeled light chains for structural studies. Native LC2 has two endogenous cysteine residues at positions 126 and 155; a third sulfhydryl was added by replacing either Pro2, Ser73, or Pro94 with cysteine. By oxidizing the endogenous cysteines to an intramolecular disulfide bond (Katoh, T., and Lowey, S., (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 1549), it was expected that the new cysteine could be selectively labeled with a fluorescent probe. This proved more difficult to accomplish than anticipated due to the formation of secondary disulfide bonds between the newly engineered cysteines and the native ones. Nevertheless, the unpaired cysteines were labeled with 5-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein, and singly labeled species were purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Chymotryptic digestion of the light chains, followed by high performance liquid chromatography separation of the peptides, led to the identification of the fluorescein-labeled cysteines. After light chain exchange into myosin, the position of the thiols was mapped by antifluorescyl antibodies in the electron microscope. Rotary-shadowed images showed the antibody bound at the head/rod junction of myosin for all the mutants. These mapping studies, together with the finding that widely separated cysteines can form multiple disulfide bonds, support a model for LC2 as a flexible, globular molecule that resembles other Ca/Mg-binding proteins in tertiary structure."
https://openalex.org/W1518420394,"We report the first direct observation of the subunit self-association behavior of highly purified recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HIV-2) proteinase. Multiple samples of enzyme were subjected to sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation sequentially at 8.8 degrees C and two pH values in the presence and absence of a C2 symmetric, peptidomimetic inhibitor. At both pH values the enzyme exhibited sedimentation equilibrium behavior which fit a monomer-dimer-tetramer model. In the absence of inhibitor, the apparent Kd for dimer formation was less than approximately 100 microM and the apparent Kd for the weaker dimer-tetramer association was greater than approximately 100 microM. In the presence of inhibitor, at either pH, dimer formation was more strongly favored as indicated by a approximately 5-14-fold decrease in the apparent Kd for dimer formation and a approximately 1.2-4-fold increase in the apparent Kd for tetramer formation. The enhanced formation of dimer and decrease in higher order self-associated forms in the presence of an inhibitor is consistent with inhibitor stabilization of an active dimer. The inhibitor-induced stabilization of the dimeric species is consistent with a model for substrate-induced formation of active proteinase dimers in virion assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1543035157,"The complete primary structures of two distinct rabbit alpha-class glutathione S-transferase (GST) subunits, rbGST alpha I and rbGST alpha II, have been derived from cDNA sequences. Clones encoding rbGST alpha I were isolated from both hepatic and pulmonary cDNA libraries, whereas clones encoding rbGST alpha II were isolated only from the hepatic library. Immunochemical and peptide sequence data confirmed that rbGST alpha I corresponds to the 27-kDa alpha-class subunit purified from rabbit lung (Serabjit-Singh, C. J., and Bend, J. R. (1988) Arch. Bioch. Biophys. 267, 184-194). Expression of rbGST alpha II in liver but not in lung and expression of rbGST alpha I in both liver and lung was substantiated by Northern and immunochemical analyses. rbGST alpha I and rbGST alpha II are composed of 223 and 221 amino acids, respectively, and are 78% identical in amino acid sequence. Compared to published GST sequences, both proteins are most closely related to the human Ha subunit (greater than 80% identity). On the basis of sequence comparison and Northern and Southern analyses, we conclude that rbGST alpha I and rbGST alpha II are products of different genes that are independently regulated. Further, the regulatory elements of the alpha-class GST genes may be significantly different in the rabbit as compared to the rat, as evidenced by the lack of induction by phenobarbital of rabbit hepatic or pulmonary alpha-class GST subunits, enzymatic activity, or mRNA. This tissue- and species-dependent expression of the predominant class of cytosolic GST implies unique functions for each isozyme and may contribute to the differential susceptibility of tissues and animals to toxicants."
https://openalex.org/W1488219774,"Three histidine residues of bovine adrenodoxin, His-10, His-56, and His-62, were modified with diethyl pyrocarbonate. The order of the modification among the three histidines were monitored by measuring the proton NMR spectra. The modified adrenodoxin exhibited reduced affinity for adrenodoxin reductase as determined in cytochrome c reductase activity. In the presence of cholesterol, the modified adrenodoxin induced a high spin form of cytochrome P-450scc on complex formation in the same manner as native adrenodoxin. The spectral titration showed that adrenodoxin modified with diethyl pyrocarbonate exhibited a 5-fold higher Kd value than that of native adrenodoxin. These effects of the modification of adrenodoxin on the affinities for the redox partners were not proportional to the number of modified histidines determined by the optical absorbance change at 240 nm. Modification of adrenodoxin up to 2 histidine residues did not affect the affinity for the redox partners, but further modification on the third one resulted in an increase of apparent Km in cytochrome c reductase activity by 2-fold and of Kd for cytochrome P-450scc by 5-fold. The 1H NMR spectra of the modified adrenodoxin unequivocally demonstrated that histidine residues at His-10 and His-62 reacted more readily with diethyl pyrocarbonate than His-56 did, indicating that modification of His-56 was responsible for the reduction of binding affinities of adrenodoxin for redox partners. These results are consistent with the proposal that the residue of His-56 in adrenodoxin has an essential role in the electron transfer mechanism where adrenodoxin functions as a mobile shuttle."
https://openalex.org/W1508491294,"Abstract The transcription of the human c-fos promoter was characterized in vitro using HeLa nuclear and whole cell extracts. The c-fos gene and c-fos promoter fusions to the SV40 early region and the G-free cassette were active as templates, yielding faithfully initiated transcripts that were sensitive to alpha-amanitin. c-fos-SV40 and -G-free cassette templates were less efficiently transcribed when linearized, suggesting that template topology affected fos activity in vitro. Transcription conditions were optimized for both extracts using a mixture of the fos wild type promoter, a deleted fos promoter retaining just the TATA box, and the adenovirus major late promoter, all driving differently sized G-free cassettes. The fos promoter was inactive at low protein and DNA concentrations, and then showed a sharp rise in efficiency with a subsequent 2-fold increase in the amount of either DNA or protein. In contrast, high protein or DNA concentrations were required for the deleted fos promoter to show only weak activity. Preincubation of templates with extracts shortened the lag time before transcription could be detected, but did not lead to increased activity. By comparing reactions in the presence and absence of Sarkosyl, we estimate that only a subset of fos-driven templates was active, and that these templates were used for several rounds of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1578292319,"Abstract To study antigenic sites present in the beta-subunit of human thyrotropin (hTSH), we produced site-specific antibodies directed against synthetic peptides analogous to the 1-18, 44-59, and 85-112 regions of the thyrotropin beta-subunit. The hTSH beta(1-18) peptide-carrier conjugate elicited antisera capable of binding to both radiolabeled hTSH and its beta-subunit whereas antibodies elicited against the hTSH beta(44-59) peptide-carrier conjugate bound only to the peptide. Thus, the NH2-terminal region of hTSH beta appears to be accessible at the surface of the hormone whereas the hTSH beta(44-59) region may be poorly accessible. Two monoclonal antipeptide antibodies that bound to 125I-hTSH beta, designated as TS01 and TS02, were selected after immunization with the hTSH beta(85-112) peptide-carrier conjugate. The antigenic site recognized by TS01 was located on the eight COOH-terminal(105-112) amino acid residues. TS02 antibody bound to an antigenic region included within Cys95 and Cys105. Both antigenic sites appeared to be more accessible on the free hTSH beta than on the hormone. Immunoblots performed on various preparations containing TSH revealed that TS02 antibody detected the beta-subunit from both the human and bovine species but not the rat TSH beta. Under reducing conditions, a low molecular weight material was identified in hTSH beta, likely caused by intrachain nicking."
https://openalex.org/W1490227039,"Abstract To investigate the relationship between transcription and polyadenylation, an in vitro system has been developed in which endogenously transcribed pre-mRNAs containing functional polyadenylation sites are rapidly and accurately cleaved in a HeLa nuclear extract. Cleavage of endogenously transcribed substrates differed from that of exogenous substrates in that a proximal 3' terminus was not required, the reaction was more tolerant of increased Mg2+ levels, and endogenous substrates were cleaved more efficiently. A promoter dependence for this reaction was suggested by the observation that substrates transcribed by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of nuclear extract were not cleaved. In addition, analysis of the bovine growth hormone poly(A) site indicated that it is highly efficient in vitro which agrees with previous in vivo data. The availability of an in vitro system in which transcription and polyadenylation are coupled should facilitate analysis of the relation between 3' end processing and RNA polymerase II transcription termination as well as the promoter requirements for polyadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W1507091852,"A heparin binding, cell adhesion promoting domain, termed peptide F-9, from the B1 chain of human laminin, residues 641 to 660, i.e. RYVVLPRPVCFEKGMNYTVR, has been investigated by 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectroscopy and CD spectropolarimetry. While small linear peptides in water solution normally exist in a number of fluctuating conformational states, CD data analysis of peptide F9 indicates the existence of some preferred average structural populations consisting of about 30% beta-sheet, 22% beta-turn, and 6% alpha-helix. NMR structural analysis supports this observation and indicates specific sequences of preferred structural populations. Evidence for these is indicated by the presence of dNN nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) populations and attenuated or absent d alpha N NOEs at short mixing times (0.1 s), 3J alpha N coupling constants of 5 and 10 Hz, and chemical shifts significantly removed from random coil positions. The NH2-terminal VVL sequence primarily exists in an extended chain conformation by virtue of large d alpha N NOEs and 9-10 Hz 3J alpha N coupling constants. Residues C10-N16 have turn-like or helix character with a run of dNN and d beta N NOEs and attenuated d alpha N NOEs. These midchain reversals include the lysine and asparagine residues proposed to be involved in heparin binding and N-glycosylation, respectively, to laminin peptide F-9."
https://openalex.org/W1574912146,"The dnaN gene of Escherichia coli encodes the beta-subunit of DNA polymerase III and maps between the dnaA and recF genes. We demonstrated previously that dnaN and recF constitute a transcriptional unit under control of the dnaN promoters. However, the recF gene has its own promoter region located in the middle of the dnaN structural gene. In this report, we use S1 mapping of mRNAs, transcriptional and translational fusions to the galK and lacZ genes, and in vitro mutagenesis to identify and characterize three tandem transcription termination sites responsible for transcriptional polarity in the dnaN-recF operon. These sites are located in the dnaN gene, downstream from the recF promoter region. Cumulatively, they terminate about 80% of the untranslated transcripts started at the recF promoters. As expected, they do not reduce transcription coming from the dnaN promoters unless dnaN translation was prematurely disrupted by the presence of a nonsense codon. The particular arrangement of regulatory elements (promoters and terminators) in the dnaN-recF region provides an exceptional in vivo system to confirm the latent termination site model of transcriptional polarity. In addition, our results contribute to the understanding of the complex regulation of the dnaA, dnaN, and recF genes. We propose that these three genes constitute an operon and that the terminators described in this work could be used to reduce expression of the distal genes of the operon under circumstances in which the dnaN translation happens to be slowed down."
