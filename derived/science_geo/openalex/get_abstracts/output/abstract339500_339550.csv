https://openalex.org/W2090757663,"The preparation of suitably large protein single crystals is essentially the rate-determining step of protein x-ray structure determinations. Attempts to produce single crystals with two model compounds-beta-galactosidase and lysozyme-under conditions of microgravity were successful. Crystals formed by salting out from solutions kept free of convection were 27 and 1000 times larger in volume, respectively, than those produced in the same apparatus but exposed to terrestrial gravitation."
https://openalex.org/W2004812025,Preliminary results of the Spacelab 1 experiment on the response of Bacillus subtilis spores to conditions of free space are presented. Exposure to the vacuum of space on the Spacelab pallet reduced viability counts about 50 percent and increased mutation frequencies by a factor of about 10. Interpretation of apparent differences in the photobiological and photochemical data between flight and ground simulation experiments will require more statistical analyses and data from actual fluence measurements.
https://openalex.org/W2037844637,"Electron and plasma beams and neutral gas plumes were injected into the space environment by instruments on Spacelab 1, and various diagnostic measurements including television camera observations were performed. The results yield information on vehicle charging and neutralization, beam-plasma interactions, and ionization enhancement by neutral beam injection."
https://openalex.org/W2009511441,"The effects of electron beam emissions from Spacelab were recorded with onboard diagnostic instruments. The variation of the Spacelab-shuttle potential with respect to the ambient plasma near the scientific air lock was investigated. Data on the waves and instabilities triggered by the electron beams are discussed. Within the electron gyrofrequency and electron plasma frequency range, strong signals were detected by both electric and magnetic antennas during the beam emissions. The frequencies of the emitted waves were compared to the characteristic plasma frequencies to enable mode identification."
https://openalex.org/W2009064879,"The atmospheric emissions photometric imaging experiment was flown on Spacelab 1 to study faint natural and artificial atmospheric emission phenomena. The instrument imaged optical emission in the region 2000 to 7500 angstroms with a television system consisting of two optical channels, one wide-angle and one telephoto. A third optical channel imaged onto the photochathode of a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube that has 100 discrete anodes. A hand-held image intensifier camera with an objective grating permitted spectral analysis of the earth's airglow and the shuttle glow. Preliminary data show magnesium ion emission features in the lower ionosphere as well as the spececraft glow spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2070880718,"The radiobiological properties of the heavy ions of cosmic radiation were investigated on Spacelab 1 by use of biostacks, monolayers of biological test organisms sandwiched between thin foils of different types of nuclear track detectors. Biostacks were exposed to cosmic radiation at several locations with different shielding environments in the module and on the pallet. Evaluations of the physical and biological components of the experiment to date indicate that in general they survived the spaceflight in good condition. Dosimetric data are presented for the different shielding environments."
https://openalex.org/W2077816612,The absolute radiometer on Spacelab 1 was used to obtain solar irradiance observations from space. A number of effects must be taken into account in the data reduction. A provisional value was obtained for the mean solar constant during the observation period (6 to 8 December 1983).
https://openalex.org/W1991541457,Thermally induced surface-driven convection (thermal Marangoni convection) was investigated in the Spacelab 1 microgravity environment. The configuration studied is related to the floating-zone technique used for crystal growth.
https://openalex.org/W1964679232,"Modifications of the suprathermal electron population were observed by an electron spectrometer on Spacelab 1 during electron beam injections. The instrument covered its energy range (100 to 12,500 electron volts) and field of view ( approximately 2pi) with high energy, angle, and time resolution. The measurements demonstrate the presence of strong beam-plasma interactions during high-current modes of accelerator operations. Spacecraft charging could be studied as well as processes that accelerated electrons to more than four times the injection energy."

https://openalex.org/W1972923976,"An array of imaging spectrometers flown on the Spacelab 1 mission was capable of providing spectra of the atmospheric emissions over a broad wavelength range from 300 to 12,700 angstroms and acquiring each complete spectrum nearly simultaneously. The instrument was used to make observations on the day side and night side of the earth, looking down in the nadir direction, radially away from the earth, and in various limb-scanning modes. Observations were made looking at various angles to the vehicle velocity vector and during thruster firings and water dumps as well as at times when such events were inhibited. As a result of the mission a data base has been acquired that is valuable for studies of both the upper atmosphere and the shuttle-Spacelab vehicle environment."

https://openalex.org/W2057667152,"The grille spectrometer observed the setting and rising sun 18 times during the Spacelab 1 mission. In addition to solar absorption lines, many of which had not been observed before, atmospheric spectral absorptions due to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were observed at heights tangent to the thermosphere (greater than 85 kilometers), and absorptions due to ozone, water, methane, and nitrous oxide were observed in the mesosphere (greater than 50 kilometers). The strongly coupled molecules NO-NO(2) and HC1-HF were observed as pairs in the stratosphere. Methane is presented as an example of the instrumental operations because of the characteristic aspect of the Q branch of its v(3) band."
https://openalex.org/W2059057588,"Very-wide-field photographs of the sky were taken on Spacelab 1 at 1650, 1930, and 2530 angstroms with a limiting magnitude of 9.3 at 1930 angstroms. A 1.2 by 2.4 kiloparsec ultraviolet extension of the Shapley wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud is seen in some of the photographs."
https://openalex.org/W2051890338,"A spectrophotometer was flown on Spacelab 1 to study various mechanisms of Lyman-alpha emission in the upper atmosphere. The use of absorption cells filled with H(2) and D(2) gases allowed us to discriminate a number of weak Lyman-alpha emissions heretofore masked by the strong H geocoronal emission due to resonance scattering of solar photons. Preliminary results are presented on three topics: the first optical detection of the deuterium Lyman-alpha emission at 110 kilometers, with an intensity of 330 rayleighs indicating an eddy diffusion coefficient of 1.3 x 10(6) square centimeters per second; auroral proton precipitations seen on both the night and the day side; and an emission located above 250 kilometers of altitude, interpreted as the result of charge exchange of magnetospheric protons with geocoronal atoms."

https://openalex.org/W2025199290,An instrument designed to take pictures of infrared spatial structures from space was flown on Spacelab 1. An image intensifier was used to give enough sensitivity and images were recorded on photographic film. The instrument worked perfectly and 1771 pictures were obtained during the night on 27 orbits (one picture every 16 seconds). Image processing of the data will yield information about the extension of large-scale structures and the relation between medium-scale structures and gravity waves.

https://openalex.org/W2022130987,"The solar spectrum experiment on Spacelab 1 measured 98 percent of the sun's total energy output. It improved the absolute accuracy of solar irradiance data, especially in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. In order to detect any variation in the spectrum on future shuttle flights, the data were obtained in a radiation scale that can be preserved with high precision over many years. The instrument performance and preliminary data reduction are described."

https://openalex.org/W1975668159,"A stack of plastic nuclear track detectors was exposed to heavy cosmic rays on the pallet of Spacelab 1. Some layers of the stack were rotated with respect to the main stack to determine the arrival time of the particles. After return of the stack the latent particle tracks are revealed by chemical etching. Under the optical microscope the charge, mass, energy, and impact direction of the particles can be deduced from the track geometry."
https://openalex.org/W2080383812,"Studies of melting and resolidification were carried out on Spacelab 1 on the zinc-lead binary, an alloy which exhibits a miscibility gap in the liquid state. The possibility of maintaining the state of homogeneous dispersion of lead in the zinc matrix in a microgravity environment was verified. The second objective of the experiment was to study Ostwald ripening of the lead droplets (manifested as slow coarsening of the droplets) within the region of immiscibility. An increase in droplet size was observed and may have been due to Ostwald ripening, although the effect on droplet size of precipitation during cooling must be analyzed before this can be determined conclusively."
https://openalex.org/W2030123127,"The Spacelab 1 mission, a joint venture of the European Space Agency and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration took place during the period 28 November through 8 December 1983. An overview of the first flight of the orbiting laboratory is presented here. The payload crew members' view of Spacelab operations and results of the scientific investigations carried out on this mission are presented in the following reports."

https://openalex.org/W1978792426,"Various operational aspects of the Spacelab 1 mission are reviewed by the four payload crew members. Two-shift operations, voice communication with ground investigators, joint participation in experiment activity, Spacelab performance, and recent advances are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2017467676,"The segregation of sulfur in liquid cast iron was studied under conditions of microgravity on Spacelab 1. A rod of cast iron containing carbon, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus was unidirectionally solidified at four different rates. The influence of sulfur on the graphite structure and the stability of an aluminum oxide skin deposited on the surface of the specimen were investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2010420603,"The payload complement on Spacelab 1 included a spectrometer for observations of the brighter cosmic x-ray sources. The primary scientific objective was to study the detailed spectral features of cosmic x-ray sources and their associated temporal variations over a wide energy range from about 2 to 80 kiloelectron volts. The instrument, based on the gas scintillation proportional counter, had a geometrical area of some 180 square centimeters with an energy resolution of about 9 percent at 7 kiloelectron volts. The results presented here show new results from two galactic binary x-ray sources, Cygnus X-3 and Centaurus X-3, and from the Perseus cluster of galaxies. The excellent energy resolution of the instrument permits line features to be identified in these sources with unprecedented quality."

https://openalex.org/W2037385374,"The Spacelab metric camera experiment acquired stereoscopic high-resolution black-and-white and color infrared photographs of various regions of the world. In total, an area of about 11 million square kilometers was covered. Because of the delay in launching the shuttle until 28 November, illumination conditions were frequently poor over many candidate targets. However, unique high-quality images with a ground resolution of about 20 meters were obtained by increasing camera exposure time. Initial image analysis has shown that these images may be used for earth mapping at the scale 1:100,000."

https://openalex.org/W2125184378,A tribology experiment in zero gravity was performed during the orbital flight of Spacelab 1 to study the motion of liquid lubricants over solid surfaces. The absence of a significant gravitational force facilitates studies of the motion of liquid lubricants over solid surfaces as controlled by interfacial and capillary forces. Observations were made of phenomena associated with the liquid on one solid surface and also with the liquid between a pair of closely spaced surfaces. Typical photographic records obtained on Spacelab 1 are described.
