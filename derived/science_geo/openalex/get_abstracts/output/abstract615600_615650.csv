https://openalex.org/W2887136521,"Soils harbour some of the most diverse microbiomes on Earth and are essential for both nutrient cycling and carbon storage. To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities1–4. Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially. Metagenomic, chemical and biomass analyses of topsoil samples from around the world reveal spatial and environmental trends in microbial community composition and genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2887886950,"The airways of the lung are the primary sites of disease in asthma and cystic fibrosis. Here we study the cellular composition and hierarchy of the mouse tracheal epithelium by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage tracing. We identify a rare cell type, the Foxi1+ pulmonary ionocyte; functional variations in club cells based on their location; a distinct cell type in high turnover squamous epithelial structures that we term 'hillocks'; and disease-relevant subsets of tuft and goblet cells. We developed 'pulse-seq', combining scRNA-seq and lineage tracing, to show that tuft, neuroendocrine and ionocyte cells are continually and directly replenished by basal progenitor cells. Ionocytes are the major source of transcripts of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in both mouse (Cftr) and human (CFTR). Knockout of Foxi1 in mouse ionocytes causes loss of Cftr expression and disrupts airway fluid and mucus physiology, phenotypes that are characteristic of cystic fibrosis. By associating cell-type-specific expression programs with key disease genes, we establish a new cellular narrative for airways disease."
https://openalex.org/W2885499809,"The functions of epithelial tissues are dictated by the types, abundance and distribution of the differentiated cells they contain. Attempts to restore tissue function after damage require knowledge of how physiological tasks are distributed among cell types, and how cell states vary between homeostasis, injury–repair and disease. In the conducting airway, a heterogeneous basal cell population gives rise to specialized luminal cells that perform mucociliary clearance1. Here we perform single-cell profiling of human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse tracheal epithelial cells to obtain a comprehensive census of cell types in the conducting airway and their behaviour in homeostasis and regeneration. Our analysis reveals cell states that represent known and novel cell populations, delineates their heterogeneity and identifies distinct differentiation trajectories during homeostasis and tissue repair. Finally, we identified a novel, rare cell type that we call the ‘pulmonary ionocyte’, which co-expresses FOXI1, multiple subunits of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and CFTR, the gene that is mutated in cystic fibrosis. Using immunofluorescence, modulation of signalling pathways and electrophysiology, we show that Notch signalling is necessary and FOXI1 expression is sufficient to drive the production of the pulmonary ionocyte, and that the pulmonary ionocyte is a major source of CFTR activity in the conducting airway epithelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis is used to identify cell types in the tracheal epithelium, including previously unidentified ionocytes, which express high levels of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR."

https://openalex.org/W2883993204,"Despite the widespread success of transition-metal-catalysed cross-coupling methodologies, considerable limitations still exist in reactions at sp3-hybridized carbon atoms, with most approaches relying on prefunctionalized alkylmetal or bromide coupling partners1,2. Although the use of native functional groups (for example, carboxylic acids, alkenes and alcohols) has improved the overall efficiency of such transformations by expanding the range of potential feedstocks3-5, the direct functionalization of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds-the most abundant moiety in organic molecules-represents a more ideal approach to molecular construction. In recent years, an impressive range of reactions that form C(sp3)-heteroatom bonds from strong C-H bonds has been reported6,7. Additionally, valuable technologies have been developed for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds from the corresponding C(sp3)-H bonds via substrate-directed transition-metal C-H insertion8, undirected C-H insertion by captodative rhodium carbenoid complexes9, or hydrogen atom transfer from weak, hydridic C-H bonds by electrophilic open-shell species10-14. Despite these advances, a mild and general platform for the coupling of strong, neutral C(sp3)-H bonds with aryl electrophiles has not been realized. Here we describe a protocol for the direct C(sp3) arylation of a diverse set of aliphatic, C-H bond-containing organic frameworks through the combination of light-driven, polyoxometalate-facilitated hydrogen atom transfer and nickel catalysis. This dual-catalytic manifold enables the generation of carbon-centred radicals from strong, neutral C-H bonds, which thereafter act as nucleophiles in nickel-mediated cross-coupling with aryl bromides to afford C(sp3)-C(sp2) cross-coupled products. This technology enables unprecedented, single-step access to a broad array of complex, medicinally relevant molecules directly from natural products and chemical feedstocks through functionalization at sites that are unreactive under traditional methods."

https://openalex.org/W3105822606,"Reflection and refraction occur at interface between two different media. These two fundamental phenomena form the basis of fabricating various wave components. Specifically, refraction, dubbed positive refraction nowadays, appears in the opposite side of the interface normal with respect to the incidence. Negative refraction, emerging in the same side by contrast, has been observed in artificial materials1-5 following a prediction by Veslago6, which has stimulated many fascinating applications such as super-resolution imaging7. Here we report the first discovery of negative refraction of the topological surface arc states of Weyl crystals, realized for airborne sound in a novel woodpile phononic crystal. The interfaces are one-dimensional edges that separate different crystal facets. By tailoring the surface terminations of such a Weyl phononic crystal, open equifrequency contours of surface acoustic waves can be delicately designed to produce the negative refraction, to contrast the positive counterpart realized in the same sample. Strikingly different from the conventional interfacial phenomena, the unwanted reflection can be made forbidden by exploiting the open nature of the surface equifrequency contours, which is a topologically protected surface hallmark of Weyl crystals8-12."

https://openalex.org/W2886259097,"A short, 14-amino-acid segment called SP1, located in the Gag structural protein1, has a critical role during the formation of the HIV-1 virus particle. During virus assembly, the SP1 peptide and seven preceding residues fold into a six-helix bundle, which holds together the Gag hexamer and facilitates the formation of a curved immature hexagonal lattice underneath the viral membrane2,3. Upon completion of assembly and budding, proteolytic cleavage of Gag leads to virus maturation, in which the immature lattice is broken down; the liberated CA domain of Gag then re-assembles into the mature conical capsid that encloses the viral genome and associated enzymes. Folding and proteolysis of the six-helix bundle are crucial rate-limiting steps of both Gag assembly and disassembly, and the six-helix bundle is an established target of HIV-1 inhibitors4,5. Here, using a combination of structural and functional analyses, we show that inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6, also known as IP6) facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice. These studies identify IP6 as a naturally occurring small molecule that promotes both assembly and maturation of HIV-1."

https://openalex.org/W2886843464,"Extant species have wildly different numbers of chromosomes, even among taxa with relatively similar genome sizes (for example, insects)1,2. This is likely to reflect accidents of genome history, such as telomere–telomere fusions and genome duplication events3–5. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, whereas other apes have 24. One human chromosome is a fusion product of the ancestral state6. This raises the question: how well can species tolerate a change in chromosome numbers without substantial changes to genome content? Many tools are used in chromosome engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae7–10, but CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome editing facilitates the most aggressive engineering strategies. Here we successfully fused yeast chromosomes using CRISPR–Cas9, generating a near-isogenic series of strains with progressively fewer chromosomes ranging from sixteen to two. A strain carrying only two chromosomes of about six megabases each exhibited modest transcriptomic changes and grew without major defects. When we crossed a sixteen-chromosome strain with strains with fewer chromosomes, we noted two trends. As the number of chromosomes dropped below sixteen, spore viability decreased markedly, reaching less than 10% for twelve chromosomes. As the number of chromosomes decreased further, yeast sporulation was arrested: a cross between a sixteen-chromosome strain and an eight-chromosome strain showed greatly reduced full tetrad formation and less than 1% sporulation, from which no viable spores could be recovered. However, homotypic crosses between pairs of strains with eight, four or two chromosomes produced excellent sporulation and spore viability. These results indicate that eight chromosome–chromosome fusion events suffice to isolate strains reproductively. Overall, budding yeast tolerates a reduction in chromosome number unexpectedly well, providing a striking example of the robustness of genomes to change. Yeast chromosomes have been fused to produce viable strains with only two chromosomes that are reproductively isolated from the sixteen-chromosome wild type, but otherwise show high fitness in mitosis and meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2887705226,"Placodes and neural crests represent defining features of vertebrates, yet their relationship remains unclear despite extensive investigation1–3. Here we use a combination of lineage tracing, gene disruption and single-cell RNA-sequencing assays to explore the properties of the lateral plate ectoderm of the proto-vertebrate, Ciona intestinalis. There are notable parallels between the patterning of the lateral plate in Ciona and the compartmentalization of the neural plate ectoderm in vertebrates4. Both systems exhibit sequential patterns of Six1/2, Pax3/7 and Msxb expression that depend on a network of interlocking regulatory interactions4. In Ciona, this compartmentalization network produces distinct but related types of sensory cells that share similarities with derivatives of both cranial placodes and the neural crest in vertebrates. Simple genetic disruptions result in the conversion of one sensory cell type into another. We focused on bipolar tail neurons, because they arise from the tail regions of the lateral plate and possess properties of the dorsal root ganglia, a derivative of the neural crest in vertebrates5. Notably, bipolar tail neurons were readily transformed into palp sensory cells, a proto-placodal sensory cell type that arises from the anterior-most regions of the lateral plate in the Ciona tadpole6. Proof of transformation was confirmed by whole-embryo single-cell RNA-sequencing assays. These findings suggest that compartmentalization of the lateral plate ectoderm preceded the advent of vertebrates, and served as a common source for the evolution of both cranial placodes and neural crest3,4. Similarities between the patterning of the lateral plate in Ciona and of the neural plate ectoderm in vertebrates indicate that compartmentalization of the lateral plate ectoderm preceded the advent of vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2887032631,"Membrane fission is a fundamental process in the regulation and remodelling of cell membranes. Dynamin, a large GTPase, mediates membrane fission by assembling around, constricting and cleaving the necks of budding vesicles1. Here we report a 3.75 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the membrane-associated helical polymer of human dynamin-1 in the GMPPCP-bound state. The structure defines the helical symmetry of the dynamin polymer and the positions of its oligomeric interfaces, which were validated by cell-based endocytosis assays. Compared to the lipid-free tetramer form2, membrane-associated dynamin binds to the lipid bilayer with its pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) and self-assembles across the helical rungs via its guanine nucleotide-binding (GTPase) domain3. Notably, interaction with the membrane and helical assembly are accommodated by a severely bent bundle signalling element (BSE), which connects the GTPase domain to the rest of the protein. The BSE conformation is asymmetric across the inter-rung GTPase interface, and is unique compared to all known nucleotide-bound states of dynamin. The structure suggests that the BSE bends as a result of forces generated from the GTPase dimer interaction that are transferred across the stalk to the PHD and lipid membrane. Mutations that disrupted the BSE kink impaired endocytosis. We also report a 10.1 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy map of a super-constricted dynamin polymer showing localized conformational changes at the BSE and GTPase domains, induced by GTP hydrolysis, that drive membrane constriction. Together, our results provide a structural basis for the mechanism of action of dynamin on the lipid membrane. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of human dynamin-1 demonstrates conformational changes and sheds light on the fission of membranes during endocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W2885282411,"Pharmacological treatment of recombinant growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) proteins reduces body weight in obese rodents and primates. Paradoxically, circulating GDF15 levels are increased in obesity. To investigate the role of endogenous GDF15 in obesity development, we put GDF15 knockout mice and wildtype controls on high fat diet for the mice to develop diet-induced obesity. Compared to wildtype animals, GDF15 knockout mice were more prone to high fat diet-induced obesity. Male knockout mice showed worse glucose tolerance, lower locomotor activity and lower metabolic rate than wildtype mice. Additionally, GDF15 deficiency increased occurrences of high fat diet-induced skin lesions. Our data suggests that endogenous GDF15 has a protective role in obesity development and lack of GDF15 aggravates the progression of obesity and associated pathological conditions. Elevated GDF15 levels in obesity may have resulted from a response to overcome GDF15 resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2885373007,"Delayed wound healing is one of the most prominent clinical manifestations of diabetes and lacks satisfactory treatment options. Persistent inflammation occurs in the late phase of wound healing and impairs the healing process in mice with diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, we observed that the late wound healing in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM mice could be improved by (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). The macrophage accumulation, inflammation response, and Notch signaling can be inhibited by EGCG in the skin wounds of DM mice. Furthermore, we found that the LPS-induced inflammation response including overactivated Notch signaling, was inhibited by EGCG in mouse macrophages. Moreover, we confirmed that EGCG could directly bind with mouse Notch-1. In addition, our studies indicated that diabetic wound healing was improved by EGCG treatment before or after the inflammation phase by targeting the Notch signaling pathway, which suggests that the pre-existing diabetic wound healing can be improved by EGCG. To summarize, wound healing can be improved by EGCG through targeting Notch in STZ-induced DM mice. Our findings provide insight into the therapeutic strategy for diabetic wounds and offer EGCG as a novel potential medicine to treat chronic wounds.-Huang, Y.-W., Zhu, Q.-Q., Yang, X.-Y., Xu, H.-H., Sun, B., Wang, X.-J., Sheng, J.

https://openalex.org/W2885393266,"Crop diversification has been proposed as farm management tool that could mitigate the externalities of conventional farming while reducing productivity-biodiversity trade-offs. Yet evidence for the acclaimed biodiversity benefits of landscape-level crop diversity is ambiguous. Effects may strongly depend on spatial scale and the level of landscape heterogeneity (e.g. overall habitat diversity). At the same time, contrasting within-taxon responses obscure benefits to specific functional groups (i.e. species with shared characteristics or requirements) if studied at the community level. The objectives of this study were to 1) disentangle the relative effects of crop diversity and landscape heterogeneity on avian species richness across five spatial scales ranging from 250 to 3000 m radii around focal winter wheat fields; and 2) assess whether functional groups (feeding guild, conservation status, habitat preference, nesting behaviour) determine the strength and direction of responses to crop diversity and landscape heterogeneity. In central Germany, 14 landscapes were selected along independent gradients of crop diversity (annual arable crops) and landscape heterogeneity. Bird species richness in each landscape was estimated using four point counts throughout the breeding season. We found no effects of landscape-level crop diversity on bird richness and functional groups. Instead, landscape heterogeneity was strongly associated with increased total bird richness across all spatial scales. In particular, insect-feeding and non-farmland birds were favoured in heterogeneous landscapes, as were species not classified as endangered or vulnerable on the regional Red List. Crop-nesting farmland birds, however, were less species-rich in these landscapes. Accordingly, crop diversification may be less suitable for conserving avian diversity and associated ecosystem services (e.g. biological pest control), although confounding interactions with management intensity need yet to be confirmed. In contrast, enhancement of landscape heterogeneity by increasing perennial habitat diversity, reducing field sizes and the amount of cropland has the potential to benefit overall bird richness. Specialist farmland birds, however, may require more targeted management approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2885528457,"Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increased between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, around 21,000 years ago) and the preindustrial era1. It is thought that the evolution of this atmospheric carbon dioxide (and that of atmospheric methane) during the glacial-to-interglacial transition was influenced by organic carbon that was stored in permafrost during the LGM and then underwent decomposition and release following thaw2,3. It has also been suggested that the rather erratic atmospheric δ13C and ∆14C signals seen during deglaciation1,4 could partly be explained by the presence of a large terrestrial inert LGM carbon stock, despite the biosphere being less productive (and therefore storing less carbon)5,6. Here we present an empirically derived estimate of the carbon stored in permafrost during the LGM by reconstructing the extent and carbon content of LGM biomes, peatland regions and deep sedimentary deposits. We find that the total estimated soil carbon stock for the LGM northern permafrost region is smaller than the estimated present-day storage (in both permafrost and non-permafrost soils) for the same region. A substantial decrease in the permafrost area from the LGM to the present day has been accompanied by a roughly 400-petagram increase in the total soil carbon stock. This increase in soil carbon suggests that permafrost carbon has made no net contribution to the atmospheric carbon pool since the LGM. However, our results also indicate potential postglacial reductions in the portion of the carbon stock that is trapped in permafrost, of around 1,000 petagrams, supporting earlier studies7. We further find that carbon has shifted from being primarily stored in permafrost mineral soils and loess deposits during the LGM, to being roughly equally divided between peatlands, mineral soils and permafrost loess deposits today."
https://openalex.org/W2886512737,"Background The global burden of low back pain is growing rapidly, accompanied by increasing rates of associated healthcare utilization. Health seeking behavior (HSB) has been suggested as a mediator of healthcare utilization. The aims of this study were to: 1) develop a proxy HSB measure based on healthcare consumption patterns prior to initial consultation for spinal pain, and 2) examine associations between the proxy HSB measure and future healthcare utilization in a population of patients with spine disorders. Methods A cohort of 1,691 patients seeking care for spinal pain at a single military hospital were included. Cluster analyses were performed for the identification of a proxy HSB measure. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictive capacity of HSB on eight different general and spine-related high healthcare utilization (upper 25%) outcomes variables. Results The strongest proxy measure of HSB was prior primary care provider visits. In unadjusted models, HSB predicted healthcare utilization across all eight general and spine-related outcome variables. After adjusting for covariates, HSB still predicted general and spine-related healthcare utilization for most variables including total medical visits (OR = 2.48, 95%CI 1.09,3.11), total medical costs (OR = 2.72, 95%CI 2.16,3.41), and low back pain-specific costs (OR = 1.31, 95%CI 1.00,1.70). Conclusion Health seeking behavior prior to initial consultation for spine pain was related to healthcare utilization after consultation for spine pain. HSB may be an important variable to consider when developing an individualized care plan and considering the prognosis of a patient."
https://openalex.org/W2885553657,"Outlier removal is a fundamental data processing task to ensure the quality of scanned point cloud data (PCD), which is becoming increasing important in industrial applications and reverse engineering. Acquired scanned PCD is usually noisy, sparse and temporarily incoherent. Thus the processing of scanned data is typically an ill-posed problem. In the paper, we present a simple and effective method based on two geometrical characteristics constraints to trim the noisy points. One of the geometrical characteristics is the local density information and another is the deviation from the local fitting plane. The local density based method provides a preprocessing step, which could remove those sparse outlier and isolated outlier. The non-isolated outlier removal in this paper depends on a local projection method, which placing those points onto objects. There is no doubt that the deviation of any point from the local fitting plane should be a criterion to reduce the noisy points. The experimental results demonstrate the ability to remove the noisy point from various man-made objects consisting of complex outlier."
https://openalex.org/W2887470427,"Over the past decades, the Hippo has been established as a crucial pathway involved in organ size control and cancer suppression. Dysregulation of Hippo signaling and hyperactivation of its downstream effector YAP are frequently associated with various human cancers. However, the underlying significance of such YAP activation in cancer development and therapy has not been fully characterized. In this study, we reported that the Hippo signaling deficiency can lead to a YAP-dependent oncogene addiction for cancer cells. Through a clinical compound library screen, we identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as putative inhibitors to suppress YAP expression. Importantly, HDAC inhibitors specifically targeted the viability and xenograft tumor growth for the cancer cells in which YAP is constitutively active. Taken together, our results not only establish an active YAP-induced oncogene addiction in cancer cells, but also lay the foundation to develop targeted therapies for the cancers with Hippo dysfunction and YAP activation."

Nutrients are scarce in these habitats, demanding effective nutrient acquisition and competition strategies. How S. aureus copes with phosphate limitation is still unknown. Wall teichoic acid (WTA), a polyol-phosphate polymer, could serve as a phosphate source, but whether S. aureus can utilize it during phosphate starvation remains unknown. S. aureus secretes a glycerophosphodiesterase, GlpQ, that cleaves a broad variety of glycerol-3-phosphate (GroP) headgroups of deacylated phospholipids, providing this bacterium with GroP as a carbon and phosphate source. Here we demonstrate that GlpQ can also use glycerophosphoglycerol derived from GroP WTA from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus capitis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which share the nasal and skin habitats with S. aureus. Therefore, S. aureus GlpQ is the first reported WTA-hydrolyzing enzyme, or teichoicase, from Staphylococcus. Activity assays revealed that unmodified WTA is the preferred GlpQ substrate, and the results from MS analysis suggested that GlpQ uses an exolytic cleavage mechanism.

The bacterial cell wall polymer wall teichoic acid (WTA) could be a rich store for alditols and phosphate under conditions of nutrient limitation, but it is not known whether staphylococci can recycle WTA from their own or from competitors' cell walls. WTAs are attached to the peptidoglycan layer via a highly conserved linkage unit followed by a poly-alditol-phosphate repeat unit, composed of 40 to 60 monomers, building up the actual WTA chain (13Brown S. Santa Maria Jr., J.P. Walker S. Wall teichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria.Annu. Rev.

In most Staphylococcus species, these monomers are either ribitol-5-phosphate (RboP), as for S. aureus, or GroP, as in most CoNS. The monomers are linked via phosphodiester bonds and are often substituted with a variety of (amino) sugars and d-alanine (14Winstel V. Xia G. Peschel A. Pathways and roles of wall teichoic acid glycosylation in Staphylococcus aureus.Int. J. Med.

Although WTA biosynthesis is well-characterized in S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis, little is known about WTA degradation (13Brown S. Santa Maria Jr., J.P. Walker S. Wall teichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67 (10.1146/annurev-micro-092412-155620 24024634): 313-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that WTA can be recycled in B. subtilis when phosphate becomes limiting, a process that requires two secreted phosphodiesterases, the exolytic GlpQ and the endolytic PhoD enzymes (15Myers C.L.

It has been suggested that the B. subtilis GlpQ acts on WTA fragments released by the PhoD phosphodiesterase and that the two enzymes have a cooperative role in the recycling of phosphate from the GroP WTA. Although S. aureus does not secrete a PhoD homolog, we recently showed that its GlpQ enzyme, which is 50% identical to the B. subtilis GlpQ, has only glycerophosphodiesterase activity but no activity against S. aureus' own RboP WTA or own lipoteichoic acid (10Jorge A.M. Schneider J. Unsleber S. Göhring N. Mayer C. Peschel A. Utilization of glycerophosphodiesters by Staphylococcus aureus.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 103 (10.1111/mmi.13552 27726204): 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The GlpQ enzymes belong to the family of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases (EC 3.1.4.46) (16Corda D. Mosca M.G. Ohshima N. Grauso L. Yanaka N. Mariggiò S. The emerging physiological roles of the glycerophosphodiesterase family.FEBS J. 2014; 281 (10.1111/febs.12699 24373430): 998-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We explored here the substrate spectrum of GlpQ toward phosphodiester bonds of purified GroP WTA derived from Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus capitis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We demonstrate that GlpQ can be classified as a teichoicase, a WTA-hydrolyzing enzyme. Teichoicase activity was first described in a soil isolate of Acinetobacter spp. (17Wise E.M. Jr, Glickman R.S. Teimer E. Teichoic acid hydrolase activity in soil bacteria (Bacillus subtilis-sporulation-phosphodiesterase-polyamines-concanavalin A).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, S. aureus GlpQ and the recently described homologous enzyme from B. subtilis are the first identified bacterial teichoicases important for phosphate supply. GlpQ was induced by phosphate limitation and enabled S. aureus to thrive in medium with limited phosphate content by mobilizing GroP from WTA polymers of CoNS. We showed previously that S. aureus GlpQ has glycerophosphodiesterase activity and cleaves phospholipid headgroups to produce GroP, which can be utilized by S. aureus. Although the homologous enzyme of B. subtilis can also cleave its own GroP WTA polymer, such an activity was not observed for the S. aureus RboP WTA. To analyze whether the S. aureus GlpQ may be able to hydrolyze the GroP WTA polymers of co-colonizing CoNS, GroP WTA was isolated from S. lugdunensis, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, Staphylococcus intermedius, and the unusual S. aureus PS187 strain producing GroP WTA (22Winstel V. Sanchez-Carballo P. Holst O. Xia G. Peschel A. Biosynthesis of the unique wall teichoic acid of Staphylococcus aureus lineage ST395.mBio. 2014; 5 (24713320): e00869Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). GroP WTA was then incubated with purified recombinant GlpQ (expressed in Escherichia coli without signal peptide and fused to the C terminus of a maltose-binding protein (MBP) (10Jorge A.M. Schneider J. Unsleber S. Göhring N. Mayer C. Peschel A. Utilization of glycerophosphodiesters by Staphylococcus aureus.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 103 (10.1111/mmi.13552 27726204): 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The release of GroP was monitored via a coupled NADH detection assay, and the identity of reaction products was confirmed by MS analysis (Fig. 1). GlpQ was indeed active toward WTA from all tested GroP WTA types, confirming that it has a broad substrate range for glycerophosphodiesters, including GroP WTA. S. intermedius and S. capitis WTAs were the best substrates, whereas WTA from S. aureus PS187, S. lugdunensis, and S. epidermidis were less efficiently degraded. In contrast, RboP WTA from S. aureus 8325-4 was not hydrolyzed (Fig. 1), which is in agreement with our previous data (10Jorge A.M. Schneider J. Unsleber S. Göhring N. Mayer C. Peschel A. Utilization of glycerophosphodiesters by Staphylococcus aureus.Mol. Microbiol. 2017; 103 (10.1111/mmi.13552 27726204): 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and demonstrates that GlpQ cannot degrade ribitolphosphodiesters. MS analysis showed that monomeric GroP is the only product of the reaction, as no GroP dimers, trimers, or other polymers were found (Tables S1 and S2). Moreover, no GroP with d-alanine or sugar substitutions was detected, suggesting that GlpQ preferentially hydrolyzes unsubstituted WTA repeating units. Quantification of the released GroP by MS supported the results from the NADH activity assay and confirmed that S. capitis WTA is more readily degraded by GlpQ than S. lugdunensis or S. epidermidis WTA (Table 1).Table 1MS quantification of GroP released from WTA or from cell walls, extracted from different Staphylococcus species after incubation with GlpQGlpQ substrateS. lugdunensis N920243S. epidermidis RP62AS. capitis ATCC 27840S. aureus PS187S. aureus PS187 GN1WTA (mm GroP)0.800.646.820.6019.55Cell wall (nmol GroP/ mg cell wall)87.5299.806573.0760.8212631.02 Open table in a new tab To investigate whether WTA that is still attached to the bacterial cell wall can be directly degraded by GlpQ, cell wall samples were extracted from GroP-WTA–producing bacteria without exposure to harsh acidic conditions to keep WTA attached to peptidoglycan. The insoluble cell walls were incubated with recombinant GlpQ linked to MBP, and the release of soluble organic phosphate to the supernatant was determined and compared with the negative control using MBP protein alone or buffer (Fig. 2). MBP-GlpQ, but not MBP, released phosphate from the cell walls of S. lugdunensis, S. epidermidis, and S. capitis, demonstrating that GlpQ is not only active against released but also against cell wall–attached GroP WTA polymers. The fact that S. capitis WTA did not lead to a pronounced release of phosphate, as observed in the NADH-coupled activity assay where GroP release is measured, might be related to a much lower amount of phosphate in the cell wall of S. capitis, which has been described previously (23Endl J. Seidl H.P. Fiedler F. Schleifer K.H. Chemical composition and structure of cell wall teichoic acids of staphylococci.Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 135 (10.1007/BF00414483 6639273): 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cell wall–derived soluble products were also analyzed by MS (Table 1) and, similar to what was observed for the degradation of released WTA, only monomeric GroP but no dimers, polymers, or modified GroP units could be identified. Quantification of the amount of GroP revealed a higher release of GroP from cell walls of S. capitis compared with S. lugdunensis and S. epidermidis, which is in accordance to what was observed for released soluble WTA molecules (Table 1). Because only unsubstituted GroP residues were detected after incubation of GlpQ with GroP WTA, we hypothesized that the different GlpQ activities observed for the tested WTA samples may be correlated to the degree of substitution of the WTA backbones with sugar residues. WTAs are usually modified with a variety of hexoses, such as GlcNAc, GalNAc, or glucose, in a species- and strain-specific manner (14Winstel V. Xia G. Peschel A. Pathways and roles of wall teichoic acid glycosylation in Staphylococcus aureus.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2014; 304 (10.1016/j.ijmm.2013.10.009 24365646): 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Endl J. Seidl H.P. Fiedler F. Schleifer K.H. Chemical composition and structure of cell wall teichoic acids of staphylococci.Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 135 (10.1007/BF00414483 6639273): 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Endl J.

Therefore, differences in glycosylation could explain the different activities of GlpQ for the different CoNS WTA types (Table 2). To verify whether sugar modification indeed affects GlpQ activity, we compared the degradation of GroP WTA from the model strain S. aureus PS187, which is substituted with GalNAc, and from the isogenic mutant GN1 lacking glycosylation (22Winstel V. Sanchez-Carballo P. Holst O. Xia G. Peschel A. Biosynthesis of the unique wall teichoic acid of Staphylococcus aureus lineage ST395.mBio. 2014; 5 (24713320): e00869Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the GlpQ activity for purified WTA isolated from strain GN1 showed a drastic increase in the NADH-based (Fig. 3A) and MS-based enzyme assays compared with WTA from the WT (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Similarly, the cell wall from strain GN1 could be more effectively degraded by GlpQ and released more GroP than cell walls of the parental strain PS187 (Table 1). Hence, our data indicate that WTA glycosylation has a strong inhibitory influence on GlpQ activity in degrading GroP-WTA.Table 2Reported WTA architecture of the investigated strainsSpeciesStrainPolyol backboneReported sugar modifications and anomeric configurationaAnomeric configurations are shown only for available data; NA, data not available.ReferencesGlpQ activitybGlpQ activity refers to the initial kinetic experiment and the formation of NADH in μm min−1. −, <0.8; +, <1; ++, <5; +++, <7.5; ++++, <10 μm min−1.S. lugdunensisN920243GroPNA–++S. epidermidisRP62AGroPα-Glc, α-GlcNAc, d-Ala and α-Glc6Ala36Sadovskaya I.

Open table in a new tab To further analyze to which extent WTA is degraded by GlpQ, we analyzed the end products of WTA-GlpQ reactions by PAGE. Degradation was visible only for the nonglycosylated GN1 strain, where the amount of WTA was clearly reduced (Fig. 4), corroborating the previous findings that GlpQ activity is higher for nonglycosylated WTA, whereas the presence of GalNAc modifications in PS187 might inhibit cleavage of the full chain, allowing only the release of probably unmodified GroP from the distal ends. To ascertain that lack of GlpQ activity toward RboP-type WTA was not due to the glycosylation of WTA, we used S. aureus strains lacking the enzymes TarM and TarS, responsible for GlcNAc modification in this strain (25Brown S.

Wall teichoic acid glycosylation governs Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization.mBio. 2015; 6 (26126851): e00632Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, unglycosylated RboP WTA from the S. aureus RN4220ΔtarMΔ tarS double mutant strain did not serve as a substrate for GlpQ (Fig. S1), confirming that RboP WTA is not a substrate for GlpQ. Although B. subtilis GlpQ is known to recycle WTA phosphate from the producer's own cell wall, we hypothesized that S. aureus GlpQ might also help to cope with phosphate limitation by using the GroP WTA of competing CoNS as a substrate instead of its own RboP WTA. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing the growth of a glpQ mutant strain (S. aureus USA300 ΔglpQ) in phosphate-deficient synthetic medium (RPMI-Pi). We observed no growth either with or without GlpQ, as expected. However, when nonglycosylated GroP-WTA from strain PS187 GN1 was added, it restored growth in the presence of GlpQ (Fig. 5A). Heat-inactivated GlpQ was not able to improve growth under such conditions (Fig. 5A), confirming that GlpQ activity is responsible for the observed growth improvement when GroP WTA is the only source of phosphate. The slight growth observed in the absence of GlpQ could be justified by the presence of other teichoicases. However, we did not detect any additional putative enzymes with our activity assays. The observation that growth under phosphate-limiting conditions could be rescued by WTA and that GlpQ permitted the utilization of WTA suggests that GlpQ could be a component of the phosphate limitation stress response of S. aureus. How S. aureus copes with phosphate limitation has hardly been studied in the past. To determine whether glpQ expression was induced by phosphate-limiting conditions, we quantified the amount of glpQ transcript by RT-PCR from S. aureus USA300 cultures grown in RPMI-Pi supplemented with different phosphate concentrations. glpQ expression levels were substantially higher at low (0.025 mm) phosphate than for high (1 mm) Pi, indicating that GlpQ is a component of the Pi stress response of S. aureus (Fig. 5B). In a different approach, a 30-min incubation in Pi-free medium was enough to strongly induce the expression of glpQ (Fig. 5C). In this study, we characterized the capacity of the secreted GlpQ enzyme from S. aureus to release GroP from GroP polymers in addition to glycerophospholipid headgroups. We show that GlpQ hydrolyzes GroP WTA from a variety of staphylococcal strains that co-inhabit the human nares with S. aureus, including the commensal S. capitis and the opportunistic pathogens S. lugdunensis, S. epidermidis, and S. intermedius (Table 2). Although all tested WTA molecules from different CoNS species were found to be substrates of GlpQ, the amounts of GroP monomers released from WTA varied between the sources of WTA. Enzymatic activity assays revealed unmodified WTA as the most potent substrate for the enzyme, suggesting that differences in the degree and pattern of WTA glycosylation between the various CoNS species may lead to different susceptibility to GlpQ degradation. MS analysis shed light on the cleavage mechanism of GlpQ by identifying GroP as the only reaction product, whereas oligomers of GroP or substituted monomers could not be detected as products of GlpQ activity on WTA.

Protein domain searches revealed that bacteria and plant IPT proteins were to assigned to different protein domains families in the Pfam database, namely Pfam IPT (IPTPfam) and Pfam IPPT (IPPTPfam) families, both are closely related in the P-loop NTPase clan. To understand the origin and evolution of the genes, a species matrix was assembled across the tree of life and intensively in plant lineages. The IPTPfam domain was only found in few bacteria lineages, whereas IPPTPfam is common except in Archaea and Mycoplasma bacteria. The bacterial IPPTPfam domain miaA genes were shown as ancestral of eukaryotic IPPTPfam domain genes. Plant IPTs diversified into class I, class II tRNA-IPTs, and Adenosine-phosphate IPTs; the class I tRNA-IPTs appeared to represent direct successors of miaA genes were found in all plant genomes, whereas class II tRNA-IPTs originated from eukaryotic genes, and were found in prasinophyte algae and in euphyllophytes. Adenosine-phosphate IPTs were only found in angiosperms. Gene duplications resulted in gene redundancies with ubiquitous expression or diversification in expression. In conclusion, it is shown that IPT genes have a complex history prior to the protein family split, and might have experienced losses or HGTs, and gene duplications that are to be likely correlated with the rise in morphological complexity involved in fine tuning cytokinin production."
https://openalex.org/W2887829978,"Telomere length homeostasis is vital for maintaining genomic stability and is regulated by multiple factors, including telomerase activity and DNA helicases. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 helicase was the first discovered catalytic inhibitor of telomerase, but recent experimental evidence suggests that Hrq1, the yeast homolog of the disease-linked human RecQ-like helicase 4 (RECQL4), plays a similar role via an undefined mechanism. Using yeast extracts enriched for telomerase activity and an in vitro primer extension assay, here we determined the effects of recombinant WT and inactive Hrq1 and Pif1 on total telomerase activity and telomerase processivity. We found that titrations of these helicases alone have equal-but-opposite biphasic effects on telomerase, with Hrq1 stimulating activity at high concentrations. When the helicases were combined in reactions, however, they synergistically inhibited or stimulated telomerase activity depending on which helicase was catalytically active. These results suggest that Hrq1 and Pif1 interact and that their concerted activities ensure proper telomere length homeostasis in vivo. We propose a model in which Hrq1 and Pif1 cooperatively contribute to telomere length homeostasis in yeast."

Here, we identify and biochemically and structurally characterize 39F7, a high-affinity agonistic monoclonal antibody (mAb) against β-Klotho that mimics FGF21 function. The co-crystal structure of β-Klotho KL1 domain in complex with 39F7 Fab revealed that the recognition of 39F7 is centered on Trp-295 of β-Klotho in a FGF21 noncompetitive manner. KL1 adopts a (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold which resembles that of β-glycosylceramidase, but lacks molecular features for enzymatic activity, suggesting that KL1 functions as a scaffold protein instead. In vitro characterization demonstrated that, although 39F7 does not compete with FGF21, it is specific for β-Klotho/FGFR1c activation. Furthermore, the agonistic activity of 39F7 required the full IgG molecule to be bivalent, suggesting that 39F7 functions by promoting receptor/co-receptor dimerization. Supported by negative stain EM analysis of full-length β-Klotho, we propose a molecular model wherein the agonistic antibody 39F7 acts in a β-Klotho– and FGFR1c-dependent manner, mimicking FGF21 activity. More importantly, 39F7 offers promising therapeutic potential in the axis of FGF21 signaling as an antibody therapy alternative to FGF21 analogs for treatment of metabolic diseases.

In vitro characterization demonstrated that, although 39F7 does not compete with FGF21, it is specific for β-Klotho/FGFR1c activation. Furthermore, the agonistic activity of 39F7 required the full IgG molecule to be bivalent, suggesting that 39F7 functions by promoting receptor/co-receptor dimerization. Supported by negative stain EM analysis of full-length β-Klotho, we propose a molecular model wherein the agonistic antibody 39F7 acts in a β-Klotho– and FGFR1c-dependent manner, mimicking FGF21 activity. More importantly, 39F7 offers promising therapeutic potential in the axis of FGF21 signaling as an antibody therapy alternative to FGF21 analogs for treatment of metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2887442098,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has emerged as a global health problem. However, no approved medication is available, and the infection biology remains largely elusive. Electron transport chain (ETC), a key component of the mitochondria, is the main site that produces ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS). By profiling the role of the different complexes of the mitochondrial ETC, we found that pharmacological inhibition of complex III, a well-defined drug target for the treatment of malaria and Pneumocystis pneumonia, potently restricts HEV replication. This effect demonstrated in our HEV models is equivalent to the anti-HEV potency of ribavirin, a widely used off-label treatment for patients with chronic HEV. Mechanistically, we found that this effect is independent of ATP production, ROS level, and pyridine depletion. By using pharmacological inhibitors and genetic approaches, we found that mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), a newly identified component of ETC, provides basal defense against HEV infection. HEV interferes with the opening of the MPTP. Furthermore, inhibition of the MPTP attenuated the anti-HEV effect of complex III inhibitors, suggesting that the MPTP mediates the antiviral effects of these inhibitors. These findings reveal new insights on HEV–host interactions and provide viable anti-HEV targets for therapeutic development.—Qu, C., Zhang, S., Wang, W., Li, M., Wang, Y., van der Heijde-Mulder, M., Shokrollahi, E., Hakim, M.

https://openalex.org/W2887505108,"Industrial fortification of wheat flour is a potentially effective strategy for addressing micronutrient deficiencies in Mongolia, given its ubiquitous consumption and centralized production. However, Mongolia has not mandated fortification of any foods except for salt with iodine. This study modeled the effectiveness and safety of mandatory industrial fortification of wheat flour alone and in combination with edible oil and milk in reducing the prevalence of multiple micronutrient intake deficiencies among healthy non-pregnant adults in Mongolia. Six days of diet records (3 summer, 3 winter) were collected from 320 urban and rural adults across the country and analyzed for food and nutrient consumption using a purpose-built food composition table, and the Intake Monitoring and Planning Program (IMAPP) was used to project the effects of fortification on summer and winter bioavailable micronutrient intake and intake deficiency under different fortification guidelines within population subgroups defined by urban or rural locality and sex. Projections showed that flour fortification would be effective in reducing intake deficiencies of thiamin and folate, while marginal benefits of fortification with iron and riboflavin would be smaller given these nutrients’ higher baseline consumption, and fortification with zinc, niacin, and vitamin B12 may be unnecessary. Fortification of flour, oil, and milk with vitamins A, D, and E at levels suggested by international guidelines would substantially reduce vitamin A intake deficiency and would increase vitamin D intake considerably, with the greatest benefits elicited by flour fortification and smaller benefits by additionally fortifying oil and milk. These results support mandatory industrial fortification of wheat flour, edible oil, and milk with iron, thiamin, riboflavin, folate, and vitamins A, D, and E in Mongolia. Considerations will be necessary to ensure the fortification of these nutrients is also effective for children, for whom the potential benefit of zinc, niacin, and vitamin B12 fortification should be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2887819651,"Drosophila suzukii (the spotted-wing Drosophila) appears to be unsuitable for the development of most Drosophila larval endoparasitoids, be they sympatric or not. Here, we questioned the physiological bases of this widespread failure by characterizing the interactions between D. suzukii and various parasitoid species (Asobara japonica, Leptopilina boulardi, Leptopilina heterotoma and Leptopilina victoriae) and comparing them with those observed with D. melanogaster, a rather appropriate host. All parasitoids were able to oviposit in L1 and L2 larval stages of both hosts but their propensity to parasitize was higher on D. melanogaster. A. japonica and, to a much lesser extent, L. heterotoma, were the two species able to successfully develop in D. suzukii, the failure of the parasitism resulting either in the parasitoid encapsulation (notably with L. heterotoma) or the host and parasitoid deaths (especially with L. boulardi and L. victoriae). Compared to D. melanogaster, encapsulation in D. suzukii was strongly delayed and led, if successful, to the production of much larger capsules in surviving flies and, in the event of failure, to the death of both partners because of an uncontrolled melanization. The results thus revealed a different timing of the immune response to parasitoids in D. suzukii compared to D. melanogaster with a lose-lose outcome for parasitoids (generally unsuccessful development) and hosts (high mortality and possible reduction of the fitness of survivors). Finally, these results might suggest that some European endoparasitoids of Drosophila interact with this pest in the field in an unmeasurable way, since they kill their host without reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W2885433082,"Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene PAH. Different PAH pathogenic variants occur in different ethnic groups with various frequencies and the incidence of the disease itself varies from country to country. In the Caucasus region of Russia, some ethnoses are geographically and culturally isolated from each other. The tradition of monoethnic marriages may cause decreased genetic variability in those populations. In the Karachay-Cherkess Republic (Russia), the highest incidence of phenylketonuria in the world has been detected (1:850 newborns) in the region and 1:332 among the titular nation Karachays. Here, we showed that this phenomenon is due to the widespread prevalence of the p.Arg261* variant. Its allele frequency among Karachay patients with PKU was 68.4% and the carrier frequency in Karachays was 1:16 healthy individuals. PAH haplotype analysis showed a unique common origin. The founder haplotype and mutation “age” were estimated by analyzing the linkage disequilibrium between p.Arg261* and extragenic short tandem repeat loci. The p.Arg261* variant occurred in the Karachays population 10.2 ± 2.7 generations ago (275 ± 73 years) and its spread occurred in parallel with the growth of the population."
https://openalex.org/W2885738298,"Disproportionate high intake of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the diet is considered as a major human health concern. The present study examines changes in the hepatic gene expression pattern of adult male zebrafish progeny associated with high levels of the n-6 PUFA arachidonic acid (ARA) in the parental diet. The parental generation (F0) was fed a diet which was either low (control) or high in ARA (high ARA). Progenies of both groups (F1) were given the control diet. No differences in body weight were found between the diet groups within adult stages of either F0 or F1 generation. Few differentially expressed genes were observed between the two dietary groups in the F0 in contrast to the F1 generation. Several links were found between the previous metabolic analysis of the parental fish and the gene expression analysis in their adult progeny. Main gene expression differences in the progeny were observed related to lipid and retinoid metabolism by PPARα/RXRα playing a central role in mediating changes to lipid and long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The enrichment of genes involved in β-oxidation observed in the progeny, corresponded to the increase in peroxisomal β-oxidative degradation of long-chain fatty acids in the parental fish metabolomics data. Similar links between the F0 and F1 generation were identified for the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway in the high ARA group. In addition, estrogen signalling was found to be affected by parental high dietary ARA levels, where gene expression was opposite directed in F1 compared to F0. This study shows that the dietary n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio can alter gene expression patterns in the adult progeny. Whether the effect is mediated by permanent epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression in developing gametes needs to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2885936514,"Recreational fishing is often perceived as harmless when it comes to fisheries management, and its impact often estimated to surpass the economic outcomes of e.g. large-scale fisheries. Recreational fisheries are often an indication of political stability and sound ecosystem management. However, despite a high economic impact, the economic costs on traditional and small-scale commercial fishers is yet to be known. This paper answers the question of how unregulated recreational fisheries could rather generate a loss to an economy, and cause unfair competition with existing commercial sectors using the example of Algeria. This paper assesses catches and economic value of recreational fisheries in Algeria, and finds that over 6,000 tonnes reach commercial markets annually, competing directly with the small-scale artisanal sector, while selling recreationally caught fish is still illegal. The paper further finds that the public is thereby deprived-through lost tax, licence income and landed value of $45 million US annually."
https://openalex.org/W2885066763,"Short-term mechanical ventilation (MV) protects against sepsis-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction. Prolonged MV induces diaphragmatic dysfunction in non-septic animals, but few reports describe the effects of prolonged MV in sepsis. We hypothesized that prolonged MV is not protective but worsens the diaphragmatic dysfunction induced by a mild sepsis, because MV and sepsis share key signaling mechanisms, such as cytokine upregulation.We studied the impact of prolonged MV (12 h) in four groups (n = 8) of male Wistar rats: 1) endotoxemia induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, 2) MV without endotoxemia, 3) combination of endotoxemia and MV and 4) sham control. Diaphragm mechanical performance, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, Interleukin-1β, Interleukin-6) in plasma were measured.Prolonged MV and sepsis independtly reduced maximum diaphragm force (-27%, P = 0.003; -37%, P<0.001; respectively). MV and sepsis acted additively to further decrease diaphragm force (-62%, P<0.001). Similar results were observed for diaphragm kinetics (maximum lengthening velocity -47%, P<0.001). Sepsis and MV reduced diaphragm cross sectional area of type I and IIx fibers, which was further increased by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Sepsis and MV were individually associated with the presence of a robust perimysial inflammatory infiltrate, which was more marked when sepsis and MV were both present (all P<0.05). Sepsis and, to a lesser extent, MV increased proinflammatory cytokine production in plasma and diaphragm (all P<0.05); proinflammatory cytokine expression in plasma was increased further by the combination of sepsis and MV (all P<0.05). Maximum diaphragm force correlated negatively with plasma and diaphragmatic cytokine production (all p<0.05).Prolonged (12 h) MV exacerbated sepsis-induced decrease in diaphragm performance. Systemic and diaphragmatic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to diaphragm weakness."
https://openalex.org/W2885779596,"Objective To assess changes in medicine availability and prices as well as subsequent affordability during the early years of the National Essential Medicine System (NEMS) reform in China. Methods Data were obtained from four provinces through a field survey conducted in 2010–2011. Outcome measures were percentage availability, delivery efficiency, ratios of local prices to international reference prices (MPRs), and number of days’ household income needed to purchase medicines. Prices were adjusted for inflation/deflation and purchasing power parity. Results Under NEMS, the median MPR for essential medicines decreased from 3.27 times to 1.59 times from 2009 to 2010. The median medicine expenditure under standard treatments in 2010 equaled 1.06 days household income at a low-income level and 0.25 days household income at a middle-income level. A 25.67% reduction was observed in the average number of medicines stocked by primary healthcare facilities in 2011 compared with 2009 and the availability of essential medicines was 66.83%. During 2009–2011, suppliers could respond to 98.24% of the purchasing orders raised by primary healthcare facilities, and 89.32% of the order amounts could be delivered. Conclusions The market prices of essential medicines greatly decreased in China after the establishment of NEMS and showed improved affordability in the short term. However, current medicine prices remain high compared to international reference prices. Medicines were often unaffordable for economically backward residents. Future policies still need to target medicine availability as well as affordability."
https://openalex.org/W2887802842,"The human transcription factor TFIIH is a large complex composed of 10 subunits that form an intricate network of protein–protein interactions critical for regulating its transcriptional and DNA repair activities. The trichothiodystrophy group A protein (TTD-A or p8) is the smallest TFIIH subunit, shuttling between a free and a TFIIH-bound state. Its dimerization properties allow it to shift from a homodimeric state, in the absence of a functional partner, to a heterodimeric structure, enabling dynamic binding to TFIIH. Recruitment of p8 at TFIIH stabilizes the overall architecture of the complex, whereas p8's absence reduces its cellular steady-state concentration and consequently decreases basal transcription, highlighting that p8 dimerization may be an attractive target for down-regulating transcription in cancer cells. Here, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations to study p8 conformational stability and a >3000-member library of chemical fragments, we identified small-molecule compounds that bind to the dimerization interface of p8 and provoke its destabilization, as assessed by biophysical studies. Using quantitative imaging of TFIIH in living mouse cells, we found that these molecules reduce the intracellular concentration of TFIIH and its transcriptional activity to levels similar to that observed in individuals with trichothiodystrophy owing to mutated TTD-A. Our results provide a proof of concept of fragment-based drug discovery, demonstrating the utility of small molecules for targeting p8 dimerization to modulate the transcriptional machinery, an approach that may help inform further development in anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2886000213,"DNA fingerprinting is a powerful tool for plant diversity studies, cultivar identification, and germplasm conservation and management. In breeding programs, fingerprinting and diversity analysis provide an insight into the extent of genetic variability available in the breeding material, which in turn helps breeders to maintain a pool of highly diverse genotypes by avoiding the selection of closely related parents. Oblong-long tubers with russeting skin characterize Russet potato, a primary potato market class in the United States, and especially in the western production regions. The aim of this study was to estimate the level of genetic diversity within this market class potato, utilizing clones and varieties from various breeding programs across the United States. A collection of 264 Russet and non-Russet breeding clones and varieties was fingerprinted using 23 highly polymorphic genome-wide simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, resulting in 142 polymorphic alleles. The number of alleles produced per SSR varied from 2 to 10, with an average of 6.2 alleles per marker. The polymorphic information content and expected heterozygosity of SSRs ranged from 0.37 to 0.89 and 0.50 to 0.89 with an average of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. Out of these 23 markers, we propose nine SSR markers best suited for fingerprinting Russet potatoes based on polymorphic information content, heterozygosity and ease of scoring. Diversity analysis of these clones suggest that there is significant diversity across the breeding material and the diversity has been evenly distributed among all the regional breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2886850079,"The real-world association between male circumcision and HIV status has important implications for policy and intervention practice. For instance, women may assume that circumcised men are safer sex partners than non-circumcised men and adjust sexual partnering and behavior according to these beliefs. Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is highly efficacious in preventing HIV acquisition in men and this biological efficacy should lead to a negative association between circumcision and HIV. However, behavioral factors such as differential selection into circumcision based on current HIV status or factors associated with future HIV status could reverse the association. Here, we examine how HIV prevalence differs by circumcision status in older adult men in a rural South African community, a non-experimental setting in a time of expanding VMMC access.We analyzed data collected from a population-based sample of 2345 men aged 40 years and older in a rural community served by the Agincourt Health and socio-Demographic Surveillance System site in Mpumalanga province, South Africa. We describe circumcision prevalence and estimate the association between circumcision and laboratory-confirmed HIV status with log-binomial regression models.One quarter of older men reported circumcision, with slightly more initiation-based circumcisions (56%) than hospital-based circumcisions (44%). Overall, the evidence did not suggest differences in HIV prevalence between circumcised and uncircumcised men; however, those who reported hospital-based circumcision were more likely to test HIV-positive [PR (95% CI): 1.28 (1.03, 1.59)] while those who reported initiation-based circumcision were less likely to test HIV-positive [PR (95% CI): 0.68 (0.51, 0.90)]. Effects were attenuated, but not reversed after adjustment for key covariates.Medically circumcised older men in a rural South African community had higher HIV prevalence than uncircumcised men, suggesting that the effect of selection into circumcision may be stronger than the biological efficacy of circumcision in preventing HIV acquisition. The impression given from circumcision policy and dissemination of prior trial findings that those who are circumcised are safer sex partners may be incorrect in this age group and needs to be countered by interventions, such as educational campaigns."

We show that the derived rate constants are consistent with the run-on oligomer sizes determined by EM analysis and are most consistent with a noncooperative growth mode of the run-on oligomer. These models and methods are extended in the accompanying article to include the full DNA-cleavage pathway and address specific questions related to the run-on oligomer mechanism including the sequestration of DNA-cleavage activity and trapping of products.

The DNA-cleavage activity of SgrAI is activated in the ROO filament by over 200-fold, and its DNA sequence specificity is also altered, allowing cleavage of an additional class of DNA sequences termed secondary sites (3Park C.K.

Only the primary site sequences stimulate SgrAI to form the ROO filaments, although SgrAI bound to secondary sites will join a ROO filament formed from SgrAI bound to primary sites (3Park C.K.

ROO filament formation depends on the concentration of SgrAI bound to primary site DNA, as well as the length of the bound DNA, and structural studies show a role for the DNA in stabilizing the ROO filaments through contacts to neighboring SgrAI–DNA complexes (4Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C.

The ROO filament is a left-handed helix with approximately four SgrAI–DNA complexes per turn that can theoretically extend indefinitely by the addition of SgrAI–DNA complexes to either end (Fig. 1). The biological role of ROO filament formation has been speculated to be in sequestering activated SgrAI on invading phage DNA to prevent cleavage of the S. griseus host genome and may also be important in providing a rapid response to invading phage (3Park C.K.

Cleavage of the secondary sites, in addition to primary sites, expands the number of possible cleavage sites in invading phage, which could be expected to enhance the anti-phage activity of SgrAI (19Moineau S.

To explain the observed enzymatic behavior, a model has been proposed that includes an equilibrium between active and inactive conformations of SgrAI that favors the inactive conformation when bound to DNA, but more so when bound to secondary-site DNA than when bound to primary (4Lyumkis D.

However, only the active conformation has the propensity to assemble into the ROO filament, which in turn stabilizes this active conformation via protein–protein and protein–DNA contacts to neighboring complexes in the ROO filament (Fig. 1) (4Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C. Allosteric regulation of DNA cleavage and sequence-specificity through run-on oligomerization.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.08.012 24055317): 1848-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The activated conformation has rapid DNA-cleavage activity, and DNA is rapidly cleaved by SgrAI in the ROO filament. SgrAI cleaves secondary-site DNA appreciably only when in a ROO filament, requiring the favorable contacts between SgrAI–DNA complexes to stabilize the active conformation. In this way the primary site DNA acts as an allosteric activator of secondary-site DNA cleavage by SgrAI. The formation of the ROO filament intuitively suggests cooperativity and rapid activation; however, until the current studies, the details of these effects were not known or quantified. We use fluorophore-labeled DNA, FRET, and an approach to equilibrium method to measure the association and dissociation of SgrAI–DNA complexes into and out of the ROO filaments. Mathematically fitting the data to various models of ROO filament assembly allowed for the extraction of intrinsic rate constants for these processes, as well as measures of affinity and cooperativity of SgrAI–DNA complexes within the ROO filament. It was found that the association rate constant is approximately 3–4 orders of magnitude slower than diffusion limited and is even slower (∼10×) in the presence of divalent cations. The extracted forward and reverse rate constants and the models developed here predict nearly exactly the distribution of ROO filament sizes observed by EM (4Lyumkis D. Talley H. Stewart A. Shah S. Park C.K. Tama F. Potter C.S. Carragher B. Horton N.C. Allosteric regulation of DNA cleavage and sequence-specificity through run-on oligomerization.Structure. 2013; 21 (10.1016/j.str.2013.08.012 24055317): 1848-1858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Models that allow for growth and disassembly of the ROO filaments at only the ends fit the experimental data as well (i.e. with similar quality of fit measures) as those that allow for breakage at any location, yet the lack of observed cooperativity in assembly, as well as the ROO filament structure, are more consistent with the latter mechanism. We use the methods, models, and rate constants developed and derived herein to analyze the full DNA-cleavage reaction in the accompanying article (24Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 2. kinetic modeling of the full DNA cleavage pathway.J. Biol.

There, individual microscopic rate constants for each step of the reaction pathway are extracted from the DNA-cleavage kinetic data. A significant finding is that the relatively slow ROO filament association rate constant, measured in the current work, limits the assembly of ROO filaments at physiological concentrations to occur only when recognition sites are found on the same contiguous DNA (24Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 2. kinetic modeling of the full DNA cleavage pathway.J. Biol.

This sequestration limits damaging DNA cleavages away from the host genome and to only the invading phage DNA. The simulations also show that because of fast dissociation of the ROO filaments and release of the cleaved DNA product from SgrAI, no significant trapping of the reaction product occurs. Hence, the ROO filament mechanism may have evolved to solve the specific requirements of its biological niche, namely sequestration (using a rate-limiting association step into the ROO filament), and the requirement for speed (to prevent viral replication and/or DNA protection via methylation) (24Park C.K.

Fig. 2 illustrates the basic experimental methodology used in this work, both in the FRET titration experiment and in the time reaction data sets (Data Sets 1–3). DNA containing a single primary recognition site (CACCGGTG) embedded in a 40-bp DNA (i.e. 40-1) is labeled with either fluorescein (Flo, 6-carboxyfluorescein) or rhodamine-X (Rox, 5(6)-carboxy-X-rhodamine). Because SgrAI binds tightly both to its uncleaved recognition site, such as in 40-1, and to its cleaved version, as in PC DNA (Pre-Cleaved DNA, a synthetic version of 40-1, which mimics the product of SgrAI cleavage, including the overhanging “sticky” ends), experiments were conducted with both forms. The purpose of investigating reactions with both forms is to both investigate the effect of cleavage of the DNA on the behavior of SgrAI–DNA complexes with respect to forming the ROO filament, as well as to derive rate constants to be used in modeling the full DNA-cleavage reaction pathway (which is done in the accompanying article (24Park C.K. Sanchez J.L. Barahona C. Basantes L.E. Sanchez J. Hernandez C. Horton N.C. The run-on oligomer filament enzyme mechanism of SgrAI: Part 2. kinetic modeling of the full DNA cleavage pathway.J. Biol.

In those reactions, the cleaved version of 40-1 (i.e. PC DNA) acts as an activator of DNA cleavage by SgrAI in inducing ROO filament formation, which stimulates cleavage of a reporter DNA. First, the FRET experiment was conducted to verify that increases in FRET occur with increasing concentrations of SgrAI bound to DNA, as expected. 50 nm Rox–40-1 and 2 μm SgrAI were titrated with increasing concentrations of Flo–PC DNA. Flo–PC DNA self-anneals into a contiguous 40-mer (with one nick per strand) via the overhanging four nucleotides (CCGG). SgrAI binds to Rox–40-1 and to annealed Flo–PC DNA to form SgrAI–DNA complexes, which then assemble into the ROO filament, giving a FRET signal (Fig. 2). Next, timed reactions were carried out, and the FRET signal was measured following mixing of SgrAI and DNA. These reactions were of three types, differing in the type of DNA used (giving Data Sets 1–3) and whether or not 10 mm CaCl2 was present (reactions of Data Sets 1 and 2 were performed in the absence of divalent cations; those of Data Set 3 were performed with CaCl2; Table 1). The reactions were performed without Mg2+ (to prevent DNA cleavage), but Ca2+ was used in some reactions to mimic the effects on DNA binding and filament formation of Mg2+. Ca2+ binds in the active site near the Mg2+-binding sites; however Ca2+ inhibits, rather than supports, DNA cleavage by SgrAI (22Dunten P.W. Little E.J. Gregory M.T. Manohar V.M. Dalton M. Hough D.

The reactions of Data Set 1 utilized only uncleaved DNA (Flo–40-1 and Rox–40-1), which was done to limit the number of equilibria that must be modeled, because it does not include the self-annealing step found with precleaved DNA (i.e. PC DNA). The reactions of Data Sets 2 and 3 do include precleaved DNA, and those of Data Set 3 differ from Data Set 2 in that 10 mm CaCl2 is present.Table 1Summary of data setsData setExperimental detailsNumber of reactions (see Table 2)1Only Uncleaved DNA (Rox-ES40+Flo-ES40)52Uncleaved and Precleaved DNA (Rox-ES40+Flo-EP40)63Uncleaved and Precleaved DNA with 10 mm Ca2+ (Rox-ES40+Flo-EP40 +Ca2+)4 Open table in a new tab Multiple timed reactions were used in global fitting and collected into their relevant data sets, as defined by the type of DNA and presence or absence of Ca2+: five timed reactions in the case of Data Set 1, six for Data Set 2, and four for Data Set 3 (Table 1, Table 2). Global fitting utilized the software Kintek Global Kinetic Explorer (26Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. Global Kinetic Explorer: a new computer program for dynamic simulation and fitting of kinetic data.Anal.

These models differ in the length of ROO filament modeled (the software limited this to a size of four or five SgrAI–DNA complexes maximum) and the manner of ROO filament growth and disassembly. In the “ends-only” model (5EO and 4EO; Table 3), SgrAI–DNA complexes bind and dissociate only from either end of the ROO filament. In the “breaks-in-the-middle” model (4BM; Table 3), ROO filament may break at any junction between adjacent SgrAI–DNA complexes within the ROO filament, and ROO filaments may form by the association of two ROO filaments of any size (or with individual SgrAI–DNA complexes). This is likely, because analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the ROO filament (Fig. 1) shows that most contacts within the ROO filament occur only between immediately adjacent SgrAI–DNA complexes (Fig. 3). Because of the additional equilibrium reactions necessary to be modeled in the case of the breaks-in-the-middle model, ROO filaments of only four SgrAI–DNA complexes or less could be modeled, giving the model 4BM (Table 3). Up to five SgrAI–DNA complexes were possible in the case of the ends-only mechanism, giving model 5EO (Table 3). Model 4EO was created to compare more directly to model 4BM, having the same size limit of ROO filaments as model 4EO. These limitations in ROO filament size are justified by estimating the average size of ROO filaments with a model allowing ROO filaments up to 14 in size and the rate constants derived from global fitting (see below). Given the concentrations of SgrAI–DNA complexes used in the reactions of all data sets, most ROO filaments are not greater than five SgrAI–DNA complexes long (discussed below under “Simulation of EM distribution”).Table 3Summary of modelsFilament assembly modelDistinct details of modelGrowth mechanism, DNA cleavageaThe ends-only growth mechanism is where only a single SgrAI–DNA complex (i.e. ES40 or EP40) adds to an ROO filament (run-on oligomer of SgrAI–DNA complexes) at a time. Dissociation similarly occurs only one SgrAI–DNA complex at a time and only from either end of the ROO filament. The breaks-in-the-middle mechanism refers to a growth mechanism where dissolution or dissociation of an ROO filament may occur at any position within the ROO filament, at any juncture between adjacent SgrAI–DNA complexes (i.e. ES40 or EP40).

Among a total of 503 patients with a history of coronary revascularization (either by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary arterial bypass grafts) undergoing non-cardiac surgery, those without severe LVSD defined by ejection fraction over 30% or HF were evaluated. The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and stroke during 1-year follow-up. Perioperative β-blocker was used in 271 (53.9%) patients. During 1-year follow-up, we found no significant difference in primary outcome between the two groups on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; confidence interval [CI] 95%, 0.56–1.82; P = 0.963). The same result was shown in propensity-matched population (HR, 1.25; CI 95%, 0.65–2.38; P = 0.504).

During short-patch base excision repair (BER), Pol β incorporates a nucleotide into a single-gapped DNA substrate. Pol β may also function in long-patch BER, where the DNA substrate consists of larger gap sizes or 5′-modified downstream DNA. We have recently shown that Pol β fills small gaps in DNA during microhomology-mediated end-joining as part of a process that increases genomic diversity. Our previous results with single-nucleotide gapped DNA show that Pol β undergoes two pre-catalytic conformational changes upon binding to the correct nucleotide substrate. Here we use FRET to investigate nucleotide incorporation of Pol β with various DNA substrates. The results show that increasing the gap size influences the fingers closing step by increasing its reverse rate. However, the 5′-phosphate group has a more significant effect. The absence of the 5′-phosphate decreases the DNA binding affinity of Pol β and results in a conformationally more open binary complex. Moreover, upon addition of the correct nucleotide in the absence of 5′-phosphate, a slow fingers closing step is observed. Interestingly, either increasing the gap size or removing the 5′-phosphate group results in loss of the noncovalent step.

Therefore, it is suggested that the single-nucleotide gap is a physiologically relevant DNA substrate for Pol β. Additionally, the phosphate group on the 5′ end of the gap is important for both the DNA binding and nucleotide incorporation of Pol β (13Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H.

The crystal structure of the binary Pol β–DNA complex revealed a lysine-rich 5′-phosphate binding pocket in the lyase domain, with Lys-35 and Lys-68 hydrogen-bonded with the 5′-phosphate on downstream DNA.

In general, increasing the gap size has a dramatic effect on the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of dNTP (Kd (dNTP)), with the single-gapped DNA showing the lowest Kd (dNTP).

More recently, our laboratory developed a FRET system to monitor the movements of Pol β during nucleotide incorporation and found that Pol β undergoes two conformational changes. Upon binding to the correct nucleotide, the fingers domain of Pol β closes onto the palm domain, followed by a second pre-catalytic noncovalent step (NCS) right before nucleotidyl transfer (or chemistry) (38Towle-Weicksel J.B.

We proposed that the second NCS may be involved in the binding of catalytic metal into the Pol β active site (the NCS throughout the text refers in particular to the second NCS step) (38Towle-Weicksel J.B.

Using this system, we have also discovered that nucleotide release before chemistry plays an important role in the fidelity of Pol β, similar to what has been found for HIV reverse transcriptase (22Kellinger M.W.

To characterize the nature of pre-catalytic conformational changes of Pol β with a variety of DNA substrates, we performed FRET analysis of Pol β on various DNA substrates that vary in both the gap size and the modification of 5′ termini on the downstream DNA. Our results suggest that both the gap size and the 5′-phosphate group influence the pre-catalytic conformational steps. In this study, we created a series of DNA substrates to gain a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism of Pol β. These DNA substrates vary in gap sizes and include 1-, 3-, and 5-nt gaps with and without the 5′-phosphate group on the downstream DNA so that we could evaluate the effects of gap size and the 5′-phosphate group on catalysis. Detailed information for all DNA substrates employed in our experiments is shown in Table 1.Table 1DNA substrates used in this study a The DNA substrates used in this study. The primer, downstream, and template DNA are defined as J, S, and T, respectively. Systematic modifications were introduced to the downstream DNA (S), as indicated by the subscript, where 1, 3, and 5 represent the gap size and +p and −p represent the presence or absence of the 5′-phosphate group on the downstream DNA (S). The X on the template DNA denotes dT with a Dabcyl modification and is located at the T(−8) position of the template DNA. Open table in a new tab a The DNA substrates used in this study. The primer, downstream, and template DNA are defined as J, S, and T, respectively. Systematic modifications were introduced to the downstream DNA (S), as indicated by the subscript, where 1, 3, and 5 represent the gap size and +p and −p represent the presence or absence of the 5′-phosphate group on the downstream DNA (S). The X on the template DNA denotes dT with a Dabcyl modification and is located at the T(−8) position of the template DNA. We first examined the ability of Pol β to bind to the various DNA substrates. Pol β binds to the canonical single-gapped DNA (JS1+pT) tightly, with a KD (DNA) of 0.5 nm (Fig. 1). When the 5′-phosphate group on the downstream single-nucleotide gapped DNA is not present (JS1-pT), the binding affinity is significantly reduced to 20 nm. Increasing the gap size of DNA with a 5′-phosphate group to 3 nt and 5 nt only slightly reduces the binding affinity to 2.0 and 1.0 nm, respectively (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the KD (DNA) does not appear to correlate with an increase in the size of the gap in these experiments, as Pol β interacts with the 3-nt gap with the lowest binding affinity for substrates with a 5′-phosphate. When the 5′-phosphate groups are not present in the 3- and 5-nt gapped DNA substrates, the binding affinity dramatically drops to 12 and 18 nm (Fig. 1). Last, when the downstream DNA is not present at all, the binding affinity is similar to that of DNA substrates without the 5′-phosphate group. In summary, our results suggest that the 5′-phosphate group has a more significant effect than gap size on the binding affinity of Pol β for DNA. Single turnover kinetics measurements were performed to determine the maximum rate of nucleotidyl transfer, kpol, and apparent nucleotide dissociation constant, Kd (dNTP) for single-nucleotide incorporation for all DNA substrates (Figs. S1 and S2). The kpol and Kd (dNTP) for the single-gapped DNA substrate (JS1+pT) are 3.0 s−1 and 1.5 μm, respectively (Table 2). We observed a slight decrease of kpol and increase of Kd (dNTP), 2.5 s−1 and 4.6 μm, respectively, for single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrate without the 5′-phosphate group (JS1-pT). Increasing the gap size to 3 nt and 5 nt has a profound effect on Kd (dNTP) but does not have a strong effect on kpol. In addition, Pol β exhibits a significantly higher Kd (dNTP) with DNA substrates that do not contain a 5′-phosphate group compared with those that contain the 5′-phosphate group (Table 2). Overall, among the DNA substrates studied here, we demonstrate that the dNTP binding affinity decreases as the DNA gap size increases and that the absence of a 5′-phosphate on the downstream DNA also results in decreased affinity of Pol β for dNTP. However, the rates of incorporation have a much weaker dependence on both the gap size and 5′-phosphate groups.Table 2DNA gap size and 5′-phosphate impact nucleotide bindingSubstrateGap size5′-Pa5′-P is the 5′-phosphate group on the downstream DNA.kpolKd (dNTP)kpol/Kd (dNTP)nts−1μms−1 μm−1JS1+pT1Yes3.0 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.3JS1−pT1No2.5 ± 0.14.6 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.1JS3+pT3Yes1.7 ± 0.03.9 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.0JS3−pT3No1.6 ± 0.043.8 ± 4.80.04 ± 0.00JS5+pT5Yes1.2 ± 0.012.1 ± 1.70.1 ± 0.0JS5−pT5No1.4 ± 0.173.0 ± 9.90.02 ± 0.00JTRecessedNobThis DNA substrate does not contain the downstream DNA.1.8 ± 0.132.5 ± 4.00.06 ± 0.01a 5′-P is the 5′-phosphate group on the downstream DNA.b This DNA substrate does not contain the downstream DNA. Open table in a new tab We also calculated the incorporation efficiency for the correct nucleotide dCTP for each DNA substrate (Table 2 and Fig. 2). It is clear that the 5′-phosphate groups separated the results into two groups, where DNA substrates with the 5′-phosphate have a higher incorporation efficiency than the DNA substrates of the same gap size but without the 5′-phosphate. These differences mainly result from the decreased affinity of dNTP binding rather than the rate of incorporation. For both groups, the incorporation efficiency also decreases with increasing gap size as a result of the weaker dNTP binding to Pol β binary complexes with DNA substrates containing larger gap sizes. The recessed DNA, which is a mimic of infinite gap size without the 5′-phosphate, has a better incorporation efficiency than the 3-nt and 5-nt DNA substrates without the 5′-phosphate. Our FRET system is constructed to measure the fluorescence signal change that corresponds to the distance of Val-303 on the Pol β fingers domain to location X (position of the Dabcyl) on the template DNA (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Therefore, the distance (r) between the Pol β fingers domain and the DNA template can be calculated for each DNA substrate in the presence and absence of dNTP using the FRET efficiency (Table 3). Among all DNA substrates investigated, we observed the shortest distance between the dye on V303C and the DNA template upon Pol β binding to the JS1+pT DNA to form the binary complex, with a distance r at 44.8 Å (Table 3). Addition of the correct nucleotide further reduces the distance r to 40.6 Å (Table 3), suggesting the formation of a ternary complex. Interestingly, increasing the DNA gap size to 3 nt or 5 nt slightly increases the r to 47.7 Å and 47.3 Å for JS3+pT and JS5+pT, respectively (Table 3), in the Pol β binary complex. However, when the 5′-phosphate group is removed from the downstream DNA, the binary complexes appear to assume a dramatically more open form with a distance of ∼51–53 Å (Table 3), regardless of the gap size (JS1-pT, JS3-pT, and JS5-pT), including the DNA substrate that does not have the downstream DNA (JT). Although the r for binary complexes exhibit variations among different DNA substrates depending on the gap size and the 5′-phosphate group, the r for ternary structures shows little dependence on the properties of the DNA substrates, with a final distance r of around 40.3 Å to 41.9 Å for all DNA substrates (Table 3).Table 3Distance (r) of Val-303 on the Pol β fingers domain to the Dabcyl quencher on the template DNA, calculated based on FRET efficienciesJS1+pTJS1−pTJS3+pTJ"

To answer these questions, here we synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides harboring seven O6-alkyl-dG lesions, with the alkyl group being Me, Et, nPr, iPr, nBu, iBu, or sBu, and examined the impact of these lesions on DNA replication in Escherichia coli cells. We found that replication past all the O6-alkyl-dG lesions was highly efficient and that SOS-induced DNA polymerases play redundant roles in bypassing these lesions. Moreover, these lesions directed exclusively the G → A mutation, the frequency of which increased with the size of the alkyl group on the DNA. This could be attributed to the varied repair efficiencies of these lesions by O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) in cells, which involve the MGMT Ogt and, to a lesser extent, Ada. In conclusion, our study provides important new knowledge about the repair of the O6-alkyl-dG lesions and their recognition by the E. coli DNA replication machinery. Our results suggest that the lesions' carcinogenic potentials may be attributed, at least in part, to their strong mutagenic potential and their efficient bypass by the DNA replication machinery.

The integrity of genomic DNA is constantly challenged by environmental and endogenous damaging agents; because of the ubiquitous presence of alkylating agents in the environment and in cells, alkylation constitutes a major type of DNA damage (1Friedberg E.C.

In addition, among the four exocyclic oxygen atoms of nucleobases, the O6 position of guanine is the most facile site to be alkylated, where O6-methyl-dG (O6-Me-dG) accounts for ∼6% of total adducts induced by some methylating agents (6Singer B.

Moreover, O6-alkyl-dG was substantially more mutagenic when located in the single-stranded region of gapped plasmids than in double-stranded plasmids, because of forced replication in the gapped plasmid and/or more efficient repair of the O6-alkyl-dG lesions in double-stranded than in single-stranded DNA (13Guza R.

For instance, O6-Me-dG, O6-Et-dG, and O6-benzyl-dG induced ∼5% mutation in a double-stranded plasmid; by contrast, the mutation frequencies of these lesions in gapped plasmid were increased to ∼60, ∼95, and ∼70%, respectively (11Pauly G.T.

However, it remains elusive about the roles of translesion synthesis polymerases in bypassing this family of lesions and in modulating their mutagenic properties. O6-Alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) is known to be crucial in repairing O6-alkyl-dG lesions (3Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M.

For instance, Delaney and Essigmann (16Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Effect of sequence context on O6-methylguanine repair and replication in vivo.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11732917): 14968-1497510.1021/bi015578fCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed a drastic increase in mutation frequency for O6-Me-dG from 10% in repair-proficient cells to 100% in repair-deficient cells. The E. coli genome encodes two MGMTs, Ogt and Ada, which are constitutively expressed and inducible, respectively (3Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M. Chemical biology of mutagenesis and DNA repair: cellular responses to DNA alkylation.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31 (19875697): 59-7010.1093/carcin/bgp262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). It was found that the efficiencies for the MGMT-mediated repair of O6-alkyl-dG lesions decrease with the increase in size of the alkyl groups (14Kaina B. Christmann M. Naumann S. Roos W.P. MGMT: key node in the battle against genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and apoptosis induced by alkylating agents.DNA Repair. 2007; 6 (17485253): 1079-109910.1016/j.dnarep.2007.03.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). For instance, purified Ada protein repairs O6-Me-dG 1000 times more efficiently than O6-Et-dG; nevertheless, it is not able to repair O6-isopropyl-dG (O6-iPr-dG) (17Graves R.J. Li B.F. Swann P.F. Repair of O6-methylguanine, O6-ethylguanine, O6-isopropylguanine and O4-methylthymine in synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides by Escherichia coli ada gene O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase.Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10 (2649264): 661-66610.1093/carcin/10.4.661Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ogt is more efficient than Ada in repairing those O6-alkyl-dG lesions carrying larger alkyl groups (3Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M. Chemical biology of mutagenesis and DNA repair: cellular responses to DNA alkylation.Carcinogenesis. 2010; 31 (19875697): 59-7010.1093/carcin/bgp262Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); whereas the two methyltransferases exhibit similar repair rates toward O6-Me-dG, Ogt could repair O6-Et-dG at an efficiency that is ∼170-fold higher than Ada (18Wilkinson M.C. Potter P.M. Cawkwell L. Georgiadis P. Patel D. Swann P.F. Margison G.P.

This effect of alkyl group size on repair efficiency also holds true for mammalian MGMT in vitro (19Liem L.K. Lim A. Li B.F. Specificities of human, rat and E. coli O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferases towards the repair of O6-methyl and O6-ethylguanine in DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (8202360): 1613-161910.1093/nar/22.9.1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Coulter R.

Thus, it is important to investigate systematically the MGMT-mediated repair of O6-alkyl-dG lesions in cells and the modulation of this repair by the structures of the alkyl groups in vivo. Although site-specific mutagenesis studies have been carried out for several O6-alkyl-dG lesions, these studies were conducted with the use of different shuttle vector systems, and most of these experiments rely on colony picking/counting and Sanger sequencing to estimate the degrees to which these lesions impede DNA replication and induce mutations, respectively. In the present study, we set out to assess comprehensively, by using a highly quantitative and robust shuttle vector-based assay (21Yuan B. Cao H. Jiang Y. Hong H. Wang Y. Efficient and accurate bypass of N2-(1-carboxyethyl)-2′-deoxyguanosine by DinB DNA polyrnerase in vitro and in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We also examined how replication past these lesions is affected by MGMT proteins and SOS-induced DNA polymerases. The major goal of this project was to elucidate comprehensively the impact of O6-alkylguanine lesions on the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication in E. coli cells. To this end, we first synthesized a series of ODNs harboring site-specifically incorporated O6-alkylguanine lesions (Fig. 1) and confirmed their identities by using electrospray ionization (ESI)–MS and MS/MS analyses (Figs. S30–S36). After ligating these oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) into single-stranded M13 plasmid (Fig. 2), we employed a modified competitive replication and adduct bypass assay, as described elsewhere (22Zhai Q. Wang P. Cai Q. Wang Y. Syntheses and characterizations of the in vivo replicative bypass and mutagenic properties of the minor-groove O2-alkylthymidine lesions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (25120272): 10529-1053710.1093/nar/gku748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Wang P.

In addition, we assessed how the replicative bypass of these lesions is influenced by translesion synthesis DNA polymerases and two DNA repair proteins, i.e. Ada and Ogt.Figure 2.Constructions of the lesion-containing and competitor genomes.

In this respect, by premixing the O6-alkyl-dG-bearing genome or the control dG-containing genome with the competitor genome at defined molar ratios prior to transfection, the blockage to DNA replication can be accurately quantified after normalizing the signal ratio for the lesion/competitor genome to that for the control/competitor genome. After replication, the region of interest in the isolated progeny M13 genomes was amplified by PCR. The resulting PCR products were digested with two restriction enzymes, i.e. BbsI and MluCI, and subjected to LC–MS/MS and PAGE analyses (Figure 3., Figure 4. and Figs. S37–S43).Figure 3.Native PAGE (30%) for monitoring the bypass efficiencies and mutation frequencies of O6-alkyl-dG lesions in SOS-induced WT AB1157 E. coli cells.

S39–S43). This result indicates the absence of insertion or deletion mutations, which are also supported by the results obtained from LC–MS/MS analysis (Fig. 4 and Fig. S37). Therefore, the bypass efficiencies for the O6-alkyl-dG lesions can be calculated from the ratio of 10-mer over 13-mer products as described under “Materials and methods,” with the consideration of the molar ratios of the lesion and control over competitor genomes employed in the initial transfection. It turned out that the size and shape of the alkyl groups at the O6 position of guanine exert negligible impact on replication efficiency, because all lesions were bypassed with high efficiency in WT AB1157 E. coli cells (Fig. 5A). We also investigated the roles of SOS-induced DNA polymerases in bypassing the O6-alkyl-dG lesions by conducting the assay in E. coli strains deficient in these DNA polymerases, i.e. Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V. Our results revealed no significant differences in bypass efficiencies for all O6-alkyl-dG lesions in AB1157 cells and the isogenic cells with single depletion of any of the three polymerases (Fig. 5A). However, for all the O6-alkyl-dG lesions except O6-Me-dG and O6-Et-dG, a substantial reduction in bypass efficiency was observed when all three polymerases were simultaneously depleted (Fig. 5A), indicating that the three SOS-induced DNA polymerases play somewhat redundant roles in bypassing the O6-alkyl-dG lesions. The result from native PAGE analysis also allows us to quantify the mutation frequencies of the O6-alkyl-dG lesions during their replicative bypass in E. coli cells. In keeping with the previously reported results, only G → A mutation was observed for all O6-alkyl-dG lesions in all E. coli strains studied (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, the G → A mutation frequencies increase with the size of the alkyl group, from ∼20% for O6-Me-dG to ∼80% for O6-nBu-dG (Figure 5., Figure 6.B). In addition, the G → A mutation frequencies were nearly 100% for all three lesions carrying a branched-chain alkyl group. We also found that the frequencies of G → A mutation for the O6-alkyl-dG lesions were not influenced by depletion of any of the three SOS-induced DNA polymerases, alone or all three in combination. This result suggests that the observed mutation arises from the intrinsic chemical properties of the O6-alkyl-dG lesions. Two alkyltransferases, Ada and Ogt, are known to be involved in the direct repair of O6-alkyl-dG lesions in E. coli cells (3Shrivastav N. Li D. Essigmann J.M.

To explore this possibility, we performed the replication experiments with the use of M13 genomes containing an O6-Me-dG, O6-Et-dG, O6-nPr-dG, or O6-nBu-dG in isogenic E. coli cells that are proficient or deficient in Ogt, Ada, or both. Our results revealed that the bypass efficiencies of the four O6-alkyl-dG lesions were not substantially impacted upon the depletion of these DNA repair proteins (Fig. 6A). However, depletion of Ogt, alone or in conjunction with Ada and AlkB, results in elevated G → A mutation frequencies, where even O6-Et-dG induces an almost 100% G → A mutation. Dual knockout of Ada and AlkB, however, only slightly increased G → A mutation frequencies for these four O6-alkyl-dG lesions (Fig. 6B). Intriguingly, G → A mutation frequency for O6-Me-dG was increased to 100% only in cells lacking both Ogt and Ada, which is consistent with previous findings (16Delaney J.C. Essigmann J.M. Effect of sequence context on O6-methylguanine repair and replication in vivo.Biochemistry. 2001; 40 (11732917): 14968-1497510.1021/bi015578fCrossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 24Rye P.T.

The O6 of guanine is only one of many positions in DNA that can be modified upon reaction with alkylating agents; nevertheless, O6-alkyl-dG lesions are of great importance in conferring the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of these alkylating agents (3Shrivastav N.

Here, we examined systematically the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of a series of O6-alkyl-dG lesions with varying sizes and structures of the alkyl group in E. coli cells. The results from these experiments offered several important observations. First, we observed that none of the O6-alkyl-dG lesions impede DNA replication strongly in E. coli cells, which differs from the findings made from in vitro experiments using purified DNA polymerases (25Voigt J.M.

Older age (OR (95% CI) = 1.26, (1.17, 1.36)), longer length of stay (OR (95% CI) = 1.01, (1.0001, 1.0342)), and a history of substance use disorder (OR (95% CI) = 1.80, (1.25, 2.60)) were risk factors for 30-day readmission. An American Indian language preference was protective against readmission.Readmission events are complex and may reflect broad and interwoven disparities in community systems. Future research should work to support community-defined interventions to address both in hospital and external factors that impact risk factors for readmission."
https://openalex.org/W2886771864,"Mobile Agent systems are prevalent in Distributed Environment due to the autonomy and adaptability in diversified situations. Mobile Agents are capable of movement from one platform to another and hence it is a need to ensure the safety of the Mobile Agent during the phase of transit. Since Mobile Agents are capable of deciding their itinerary dynamically, a decision support system which helps to ensure the trustworthiness of a platform would complement the decision. A Trust Scoring System is therefore proposed to measure the trustworthiness of a platform based on a metric termed Trust Score. Trust Score varies dynamically with respect to time and is based on a function comprising of five parameters namely Persistence, Competence, Reputation, Credibility and Integrity. In order to reduce the computational latency, another metric named Trust Rank for platforms, based on Trustability co-efficient of variation is introduced. The experimentation is done in cloud environment with platforms located at different geographic regions. The performance is evaluated in terms of response time and accuracy of decision. From the experimental results, it is evident that the Trust Ranking mechanism consumes less response time and improves the accuracy of decision of Mobile Agents during their itineraries, compared to that of the prototype system that uses Trust Score alone as a measure of decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2887361849,"Patterns of precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition are changing in ecosystems worldwide. Simultaneous increases in precipitation and N deposition can relieve co-limiting soil resource conditions for plants and result in synergistic plant responses, which may affect animals and plant responses to higher trophic levels. However, the potential for synergistic effects of precipitation and N deposition on animals and plant responses to herbivores and predators (via trophic cascades) is unclear. We investigated the influence of precipitation and N enrichment on ecological dynamics across three trophic levels, hypothesizing that herbivores and plants would exhibit synergistic responses to the combined influence of precipitation, N amendments and predators. To test this, we conducted a field experiment with arthropods on two model plant species, Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana rustica. First, we characterized the plant-arthropod assemblages, finding that N. tabacum hosted greater abundances of caterpillars, while N. rustica hosted more sap-sucking herbivores. Next, we evaluated the effects of rainwater, soil N, and predatory spider manipulations for both plant-arthropod assemblages. On N. tabacum, water and N availability had an interactive effect on caterpillars, where caterpillars were most abundant with rainwater additions and least abundant when both rainwater and N were added. For N. rustica, foliar chemistry had a synergistic response to all three experimental factors. Compared to spider-absent conditions, leaf N concentration increased and C/N decreased when spiders were present, but this response only occurred under high water and N availability. Spiders indirectly altered plant chemistry via a facilitative effect of spiders on sap-sucking herbivores, potentially due to intra-guild predation, and a positive effect of sap-suckers on foliar N concentration. Our study suggests that predictions of the ecological impacts of altered precipitation and N deposition may need to account for the effects of resource co-limitation on dynamics across trophic levels."

https://openalex.org/W2886496503,"The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a critical element in mounting an effective immune response in vertebrates against invading pathogens. Studies of MHC in wildlife populations have typically focused on assessing diversity within the peptide binding regions (PBR) of the MHC class II (MHC II) family, especially the DQ receptor genes. Such metrics of diversity, however, are of limited use to health risk assessment since functional analyses (where changes in the PBR are correlated to recognition/pathologies of known pathogen proteins), are difficult to conduct in wildlife species. Here we describe a means to predict the binding preferences of MHC proteins: We have developed a model positional scanning library analysis (MPSLA) by harnessing the power of mixture based combinatorial libraries to probe the peptide landscapes of distinct MHC II DQ proteins. The algorithm provided by NNAlign was employed to predict the binding affinities of sets of peptides generated for DQ proteins. These binding affinities were then used to retroactively construct a model Positional Scanning Library screen. To test the utility of the approach, a model screen was compared to physical combinatorial screens for human MHC II DP. Model library screens were generated for DQ proteins derived from sequence data from bottlenose dolphins from the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) and the Atlantic coast of Florida, and compared to screens of DQ proteins from Genbank for dolphin and three other cetaceans. To explore the peptide binding landscape for DQ proteins from the IRL, combinations of the amino acids identified as active were compiled into peptide sequence lists that were used to mine databases for representation in known proteins. The frequency of which peptide sequences predicted to bind the MHC protein are found in proteins from pathogens associated with marine mammals was found to be significant (p values <0.0001). Through this analysis, genetic variation in MHC (classes I and II) can now be associated with the binding repertoires of the expressed MHC proteins and subsequently used to identify target pathogens. This approach may be eventually applied to evaluate individual population and species risk for outbreaks of emerging diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2885162304,"Root-hemiparasitic plants of the genus Rhinanthus acquire resources through a water-wasting physiological strategy based on high transpiration rate mediated by the accumulation of osmotically active compounds and constantly open stomata. Interestingly, they were also documented to withstand moderate water stress which agrees with their common occurrence in rather dry habitats. Here, we focused on the water-stress physiology of Rhinanthus alectorolophus by examining gas exchange, water relations, stomatal density, and biomass production and its stable isotope composition in adult plants grown on wheat under contrasting (optimal and drought-inducing) water treatments. We also tested the effect of water stress on the survival of Rhinanthus seedlings, which were watered either once (after wheat sowing), twice (after wheat sowing and the hemiparasite planting) or continuously (twice and every sixth day after that). Water shortage significantly reduced seedling survival as well as the biomass production and gas exchange of adult hemiparasites. In spite of that drought-stressed and even wilted plants from both treatments still considerably photosynthesized and transpired. Strikingly, low-irrigated plants exhibited significantly elevated photosynthetic rate compared with high-irrigated plants of the same water status. This might relate to biochemical adjustments of these plants enhancing the resource uptake from the host. Moreover, low-irrigated plants did not acclimatize to water stress by lowering their osmotic potential, perhaps due to the capability to tolerate drought without such an adjustment, as their osmotic potential at full turgor was already low. Contrary to results of previous studies, hemiparasites seem to close their stomata in response to severe drought stress and this happens probably passively after turgor is lost in guard cells. The physiological traits of hemiparasites, namely the low osmotic potential associated with their parasitic lifestyle and the ability to withstand drought and recover from the wilting likely enable them to grow in dry habitats. However, the absence of osmotic adjustment of adults and sensitivity of seedlings to severe drought stress demonstrated here may result in a substantial decline of the hemiparasitic species with ongoing climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2885109013,"On the basis of the Crank-Nicolson method, we develop a conservative finite-difference scheme for investigation of the THz pulse interaction with a multilevel medium, covered by a disordered layered structure, in the framework of the Maxwell-Bloch equations, describing the substance evolution and the electromagnetic field evolution. For this set of the partial differential equations, the conservation laws are derived and proved. We generalize the Bloch invariant with respect to the multilevel medium. The approximation order of the developed finite-difference scheme is investigated and its conservatism property is also proved. To solve the difference equations, which are nonlinear with respect to the electric field strength, we propose an iteration method and its convergence is proved. To increase the computer simulation efficiency, we use the well-known solution of Maxwell's equations in 1D case as artificial boundary condition. It is approximated using Cabaret scheme with the second order of an accuracy. On the basis of developed finite-difference scheme, we investigate the broadband THz pulse interaction with a medium covered by a disordered structure. This problem is of interest for the substance detection and identification. We show that the disordered structure dramatically induces an appearance of the substance false absorption frequencies. We demonstrate also that the spectrum for the transmitted and reflected pulses becomes broader due to the cascade mechanism of the high energy levels excitation of molecules. It leads to the substance emission at the frequencies, which are far from the frequency range for the incident pulse spectrum. Time-dependent spectral intensities at these frequencies are weakly disturbed by the disordered cover and, hence, they can be used for the substance identification."
https://openalex.org/W2885953881,"Peach (Prunus persica L.) generally exhibits self-pollination, however, they can also be pollinated by other varieties of pollen. Here we found two varieties that are different from other peaches: ‘Daifei’ and ‘Liuyefeitao’. ‘Daifei’ produces less pollen, which needs artificial pollination, honeybee pollination, and the fruit setting depends on other varieties of peach pollen. ‘Liuyefeitao’ exhibits strictly self-pollination, hence pollen from other species is rejected. To explore the mechanism of this phenomenon, we performed a high-throughput sequencing of the stigma (including style) of ‘Daifei’ and ‘Liuyefeitao’ to explain the rejection mechanism of other varieties of pollen of ‘Liuyefeitao’ peach. In our study, we found one S gene, and lots of non-S-locus factors such as: F-box proteins, Ub/26S, MAPKs, RLK, and transcription factor were differential expressed between ‘Daifei’ and ‘Liuyefeitao’. We supposed that the strictly self-compatible of ‘Liuyefeitao’ may result from the synthesis of these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2885434947,"Interactions with artificial agents often lack immediacy because agents respond slower than their users expect. Automatic speech recognisers introduce this delay by analysing a user’s utterance only after it has been completed. Early, uncertain hypotheses of incremental speech recognisers can enable artificial agents to respond more timely. However, these hypotheses may change significantly with each update. Therefore, an already initiated action may turn into an error and invoke error cost. We investigated whether humans would use uncertain hypotheses for planning ahead and/or initiating their response. We designed a Ghost-in-the-Machine study in a bar scenario. A human participant controlled a bartending robot and perceived the scene only through its recognisers. The results showed that participants used uncertain hypotheses for selecting the best matching action. This is comparable to computing the utility of dialogue moves. Participants evaluated the available evidence and the error cost of their actions prior to initiating them. If the error cost was low, the participants initiated their response with only suggestive evidence. Otherwise, they waited for additional, more confident hypotheses if they still had time to do so. If there was time pressure but only little evidence, participants grounded their understanding with echo questions. These findings contribute to a psychologically plausible policy for human-robot interaction that enables artificial agents to respond more timely and socially appropriately under uncertainty."
