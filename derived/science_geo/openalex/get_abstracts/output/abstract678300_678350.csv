https://openalex.org/W3186268672,"People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at high risk for COVID-19 complications and fatality, and have been prioritized for vaccination in many areas. Yet little is known about vaccine acceptance in this population. The objective of this study was to determine the level of vaccine hesitancy among PEH in Los Angeles, CA and to understand the covariates of hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 risk, threat perception, self-protection and information sources. A novel mobile survey platform was deployed to recruit PEH from a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in Los Angeles to participate in a monthly rapid response study of COVID-19 attitudes, behaviors, and risks. Of 90 PEH surveyed, 43 (48%) expressed some level of vaccine hesitancy based either on actual vaccine offers (17/90 = 19%) or a hypothetical offer (73/90 = 81%). In bivariate analysis, those with high COVID-19 threat perception were less likely to be vaccine hesitant (OR = 0.34, P = 0.03), while those who frequently practiced COVID-19 protective behaviors were more likely to be vaccine hesitant (OR = 2.21, P = 0.08). In a multivariate model, those with high threat perception (AOR = 0.25, P = 0.02) were less likely to be hesitant, while those engaging in COVID-19 protective behaviors were more hesitant (AOR = 3.63, P = 0.02). Those who trusted official sources were less hesitant (AOR = 0.37, P = 0.08) while those who trusted friends and family for COVID-19 information (AOR = 2.70, P = 0.07) were more likely to be hesitant. Findings suggest that targeted educational and social influence interventions are needed to address high levels of vaccine hesitancy among PEH."
https://openalex.org/W3183378605,"Background Since February 2020, over 2.5 million Texans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 20% are young adults at risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure at work, academic, and social settings. This study investigated demographic and clinical risk factors for severe disease and readmission among young adults 18–29 years old, who were diagnosed at a hospital encounter in Houston, Texas, USA. Methods and findings A retrospective registry-based chart review was conducted investigating demographic and clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 among patients aged 18–29 with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. In the cohort of 1,853 young adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection at a hospital encounter, including 226 pregnant women, 1,438 (78%) scored 0 on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and 833 (45%) were obese (≥30 kg/m 2 ). Within 30 days of their diagnostic encounter, 316 (17%) patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, 148 (8%) received other severe disease diagnoses, and 268 (14%) returned to the hospital after being discharged home. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–1.2, p&lt;0.001), male gender (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7, p = 0.002), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.1, p = 0.01), obesity (3.1, 95% CI 1.9–5.1, p&lt;0.001), asthma history (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3–4.0, p = 0.003), congestive heart failure (aOR 6.0, 95% CI 1.5–25.1, p = 0.01), cerebrovascular disease (aOR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7–14.7, p = 0.004), and diabetes (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.9–6.2, p &lt;0.001) were predictive of severe disease diagnoses within 30 days. Non-Hispanic Black race (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.4, p = 0.04), obesity (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0–2.9, p = 0.046), asthma history (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0–2.7, p = 0.03), myocardial infarction history (aOR 6.2, 95% CI 1.7–23.3, p = 0.01), and household exposure (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.2, p = 0.02) were predictive of 30-day readmission. Conclusions This investigation demonstrated the significant risk of severe disease and readmission among young adult populations, especially marginalized communities and people with comorbidities, including obesity, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Health authorities must emphasize COVID-19 awareness and prevention in young adults and continue investigating risk factors for severe disease, readmission and long-term sequalae."
https://openalex.org/W3184595783,"Within the network approach to psychopathology, cross-sectional partial correlation networks have frequently been used to estimate relationships between symptoms. The resulting relationships have been used to generate hypotheses about causal links between symptoms. In order to justify such exploratory use of partial correlation networks, one needs to assume that the between-subjects relationships in the network approximate systematic within-subjects relationships, which are in turn the results of some within-subjects causal mechanism. If this assumption holds, relationships in the network should be mirrored by relationships between symptom changes; if links in networks approximate systematic within-subject relationships, change in a symptom should relate to change in connected symptoms.To investigate this implication, we combined longitudinal data on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index from four samples of borderline personality disorder patients (N = 683). We related parameters from baseline partial correlation networks of symptoms to relationships between change trajectories of these symptoms.Across multiple levels of analysis, our results showed that parameters from baseline partial correlation networks are strongly predictive of relationships between change trajectories.By confirming its implication, our results support the idea that cross-sectional partial correlation networks hold a relevant amount of information about systematic within-subjects relationships and thereby have exploratory value to generate hypotheses about the causal dynamics between symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3125438160,"To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have ‘locked down’, restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact through supply chains, which are a network of firms for production, by simulating an agent-based model of production using supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the interactions between lockdown regions, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We find that a region’s upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on whether it lifts the lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked through supply chains. These results indicate that the economic effect produced by exogenous shocks in a region can affect other regions and therefore this study proposes the need for inter-region policy coordination to reduce economic loss due to lockdowns."
https://openalex.org/W3184929654,"Pneumonia is a common cause of illness and death of the elderly in Japan. Its prevalence is escalating globally with the aging of population. To describe the latest trends in pneumonia hospitalizations, especially aspiration pneumonia (AP) cases, we assessed the clinical records of pneumonia patients admitted to core acute care hospitals in Miyagi prefecture, Japan.A retrospective multi-institutional joint research was conducted for hospitalized pneumonia patients aged ≥20 years from January 2019 to December 2019. Clinical data of patients were collected from the medical records of eight acute care hospitals.Out of the 1,800 patients included in this study, 79% of the hospitalized pneumonia patients were aged above 70 years. The most common age group was in the 80s. The ratio of AP to total pneumonia cases increased with age, and 692 out of 1,800 patients had AP. In univariate analysis, these patients had significantly older ages, lower body mass index (BMI), a lower ratio of normal diet intake and homestay before hospitalization, along with more AP recurrences and comorbidities. During hospitalization, AP patients had extended fasting periods, more swallowing assessments and interventions, longer hospitalization, and higher in-hospital mortality rate than non-AP patients. A total of 7% and 2% AP patients underwent video endoscopy and video fluorography respectively. In multivariate analysis, lower BMI, lower C-reactive protein, a lower ratio of homestay before hospitalization, a higher complication rate of cerebrovascular disease, dementia, and neuromuscular disease were noted as a characteristic of AP patients. Swallowing interventions were performed for 51% of the AP patients who had been hospitalized for more than two weeks. In univariate analysis, swallowing intervention improved in-hospital mortality. Lower AP recurrence before hospitalization and a lower ratio of homestay before hospitalization were indicated as characteristics of AP patients of the swallowing intervention group from multivariate analysis. Change in dietary pattern from normal to modified diet was observed more frequently in the swallowing intervention group.AP accounts for 38.4% of all pneumonia cases in acute care hospitals in Northern Japan. The use of swallowing evaluations and interventions, which may reduce the risk of dysphagia and may associate with lowering mortality in AP patients, is still not widespread."
https://openalex.org/W3183204269,"There is paucity of population-based data on occupational noise exposure and risk of age-related hearing loss. Therefore, we assessed cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of past workplace noise exposure with hearing loss in older adults. At baseline, 1923 participants aged 50+ years with audiological and occupational noise exposure data included for analysis. The pure-tone average of frequencies 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 kHz (PTA0.5-4KHz) >25 dB HL in the better ear, established the presence of hearing loss. Participants reported exposure to workplace noise, and the severity and duration of this exposure. Prior occupational noise exposure was associated with a 2-fold increased odds of moderate-to-severe hearing loss: multivariable-adjusted OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.45-3.79). Exposure to workplace noise for >10 years increased the odds of having any hearing loss (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.37-4.19) and moderate-to-severe hearing loss (OR 6.80, 95% CI 2.97-15.60). Among participants reporting past workplace noise exposure at baseline the 10-year incidence of hearing loss was 35.5% versus 29.1% in those who had no workplace noise exposure. Workplace noise exposure was associated with a greater risk of incident hearing loss during the 10-year follow-up: multivariable-adjusted OR 1.39 (95% CI 1.13-1.71). Prior occupational noise exposure was not associated with hearing loss progression. Workplace noise exposure increased the risk of incident hearing loss in older adults. Our findings underscore the importance of preventive measures which diminish noise exposure in the workplace, which could potentially contribute towards reducing the burden of hearing loss in later life."
https://openalex.org/W3183139673,"This investigation aimed to develop a method to predict the total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity, TSS/titratable acidity, vitamin C, anthocyanin, and total carotenoids contents using surface color values (L*, Hue and chroma), single fruit weight, juice volume, and sphericity percent of fresh peach fruit. Multiple regression analysis (MLR) and an artificial neural network (ANN) were employed. An ANN model was developed with six inputs and 15 neurons in the first hidden layer for the prediction of six chemical composition parameters. The results confirmed that the ANN model R2 = 974-0.998 outperformed the MLR models R2 = 0.473-0.840 using testing dataset. Moreover, sensitivity analysis revealed that the juice volume was the most dominating parameter for the prediction of titratable acidity, TSS/titratable acidity and vitamin C with corresponding contribution values of 39.97%, 50.40%, and 33.08%, respectively. In addition, sphericity percent contributed by 23.70% to anthocyanin and by 24.08% to total carotenoids. Furthermore, hue on TSS prediction was the highest compared with the other parameters, with a contribution percentage of 20.86%. Chroma contributed by different values to all variables in the range of 5.29% to 19.39%. Furthermore, fruit weight contributed by different values to all variables in the range of 16.67% to 23.48%. The ANN prediction method denotes a promising methodology to estimate targeted chemical composition levels of fresh peach fruits. The information of peach quality reported in this investigation can be used as a baseline for understanding and further examining peach fruit quality."
https://openalex.org/W3183832028,"The field of protein residue network (PRN) research has brought several useful methods and techniques for structural analysis of proteins and protein complexes. Many of these are ripe and ready to be used by the proteomics community outside of the PRN specialists. In this paper we present software which collects an ensemble of (network) methods tailored towards the analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) and/or interactions of proteins with ligands of other type, e.g. nucleic acids, oligosaccharides etc. In parallel, we propose the use of the network differential analysis as a method to identify residues mediating key interactions between proteins. We use a model system, to show that in combination with other, already published methods, also included in pyProGA, it can be used to make such predictions. Such extended repertoire of methods allows to cross-check predictions with other methods as well, as we show here. In addition, the possibility to construct PRN models from various kinds of input is so far a unique asset of our code. One can use structural data as defined in PDB files and/or from data on residue pair interaction energies, either from force-field parameters or fragment molecular orbital (FMO) calculations. pyProGA is a free open-source software available from https://gitlab.com/Vlado_S/pyproga."
https://openalex.org/W3186929168,"Spontaneous recognition tests, which utilize rodents' innate tendency to explore novelty, can evaluate not only simple non-associative recognition memory but also more complex associative memory in animals. In the present study, we investigated whether the length of the object familiarization period (sample phase) improved subsequent novelty discrimination in the spontaneous object, place, and object-place-context (OPC) recognition tests in rats. In the OPC recognition test, rats showed a significant novelty preference only when the familiarization period was 30 min but not when it was 5 min or 15 min. In addition, repeated 30-min familiarization periods extended the significant novelty preference to 72 hours. However, the rats exhibited a successful discrimination between the stayed and replaced objects under 15 min and 30 min familiarization period conditions in the place recognition test and between the novel and familiar objects under all conditions of 5, 15 and 30 min in the object recognition test. Our results suggest that the extension of the familiarization period improves performance in the spontaneous recognition paradigms, and a longer familiarization period is necessary for long-term associative recognition memory than for non-associative memory."
https://openalex.org/W3183320483,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique that is increasingly used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and neuroscience research. Due to the complex structure of the brain and the electrical conductivity variation across subjects, identification of subject-specific brain regions for TMS is important to improve the treatment efficacy and understand the mechanism of treatment response. Numerical computations have been used to estimate the stimulated electric field (E-field) by TMS in brain tissue. But the relative long computation time limits the application of this approach. In this paper, we propose a deep-neural-network based approach to expedite the estimation of whole-brain E-field by using a neural network architecture, named 3D-MSResUnet and multimodal imaging data. The 3D-MSResUnet network integrates the 3D U-net architecture, residual modules and a mechanism to combine multi-scale feature maps. It is trained using a large dataset with finite element method (FEM) based E-field and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based anisotropic volume conductivity or anatomical images. The performance of 3D-MSResUnet is evaluated using several evaluation metrics and different combinations of imaging modalities and coils. The experimental results show that the output E-field of 3D-MSResUnet provides reliable estimation of the E-field estimated by the state-of-the-art FEM method with significant reduction in prediction time to about 0.24 second. Thus, this study demonstrates that neural networks are potentially useful tools to accelerate the prediction of E-field for TMS targeting."
https://openalex.org/W3183454503,"A screening centre in Soweto, South Africa (SA), investigated high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), HIV, cervical cancer risk amongst women.This cross-sectional study (June 2018-March 2019) describes screening results (Roche Linear Array HPV test and Pap smear liquid based cytology) and history of screening (known HIV status, antiretroviral therapy [ART] use, previous Pap smears). Data were stratified by age group (18-29, 30+ years), HIV status, Pap smear results and tested for statistical significance.Of 280 women, 20.4% were HIV-positive, 18.2% had abnormal Pap smears, 41.8% had HR-HPV. Of older women, 48.2% (n = 78/162) had never had a Pap smear. Of younger women, 89.0% (n = 105/118) never had a Pap smear, but had significantly more low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) and other HR-HPV infection than older women (12.7%[n = 15/118] vs 4.9%[n = 8/162], p = 0.0193; and 49.2%[n = 58/118] vs 29.0%[n = 47/162], p = 0.0006; respectively). HIV-positive women had more abnormal cytology results and infection with other HR-HPV types or co-infection with other HR-HPV type(s)/HPV-16 compared to HIV-negative women (35.1%[n = 20/57] vs 13.9%[n = 31/223], p = 0.0002; 56.1%[n = 32/57] vs 32.7%[n = 73/223], p = 0.001; and 12.3%[n = 7/57] vs 4.9%[n = 11/223], p = 0.044; respectively). Of 57 HIV-positive women, 45.6% (n = 26) already knew their HIV status; of which 69.2% were on ART and 34.6% never had a Pap smear.South African women have high rates of HIV, Pap smear abnormalities and HR-HPV, with low cervical cancer screening coverage. SA cervical cancer screening policy excludes (undiagnosed) HIV-positive and HIV-negative women <30 years, both populations found to have high prevalence of HR-HPV. HPV-based primary screening from 25 years could improve outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3183676205,"Though institutional delivery plays a significant role in maternal and child health, there is substantial evidence that the majority of rural women have lower health facility delivery than urban women. So, identifying the drivers of these disparities will help policy-makers and programmers with the reduction of maternal and child death.The study used the data on a nationwide representative sample from the most recent rounds of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of four East African countries. A Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis and its extensions was conducted to see the urban-rural differences in institutional delivery into two components: one that is explained by residence difference in the level of the determinants (covariate effects), and the other components was explained by differences in the effect of the covariates on the outcome (coefficient effects).The findings showed that institutional delivery rates were 21.00% in Ethiopia, 62.61% in Kenya, 65.29% in Tanzania and 74.64% in Uganda. The urban-rural difference in institutional delivery was higher in the case of Ethiopia (61%), Kenya (32%) and Tanzania (30.3%), while the gap was relatively lower in the case of Uganda (19.2%). Findings of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition and its extension showed that the covariate effect was dominant in all study countries. The results were robust to the different decomposition weighting schemes. The frequency of antenatal care, wealth and parity inequality between urban and rural households explains most of the institutional delivery gap.The urban-rural institutional delivery disparities were high in study countries. By identifying the underlying factors behind the urban-rural institutional birth disparities, the findings of this study help in designing effective intervention measures targeted at reducing residential inequalities and improving population health outcomes. Future interventions to encourage institutional deliveries to rural women of these countries should therefore emphasize increasing rural women's income, access to health care facilities to increase the frequency of antenatal care utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3184312365,"Microarray patches (MAPs) have the potential to be a safer, more acceptable, easier to use and more cost-effective method for administration of vaccines when compared to the needle and syringe. Since MAPs deliver vaccine to the dermis and epidermis, a degree of local immune response at the site of application is expected. In a phase 1 clinical trial (ACTRN 12618000112268), the Vaxxas high-density MAP (HD-MAP) was used to deliver a monovalent, split inactivated influenza virus vaccine into the skin. HD-MAP immunisation led to significantly enhanced humoral responses on day 8, 22 and 61 compared with IM injection of a quadrivalent commercial seasonal influenza vaccine (Afluria Quadrivalent®). Here, the aim was to analyse cellular responses to HD-MAPs in the skin of trial subjects, using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. HD-MAPs were coated with a split inactivated influenza virus vaccine (A/Singapore/GP1908/2015 [H1N1]), to deliver 5 μg haemagglutinin (HA) per HD-MAP. Three HD-MAPs were applied to the volar forearm (FA) of five healthy volunteers (to achieve the required 15 μg HA dose), whilst five control subjects received three uncoated HD-MAPs (placebo). Local skin response was recorded for over 61 days and haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres (HAI) were assessed on days 1, 4, 8, 22, and 61. Skin biopsies were taken before (day 1), and three days after HD-MAP application (day 4) and analysed by flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry to compare local immune subset infiltration. HD-MAP vaccination with 15 μg HA resulted in significant HAI antibody titres compared to the placebo group. Application of uncoated placebo HD-MAPs resulted in mild erythema and oedema in most subjects, that resolved by day 4 in 80% of subjects. Active, HA-coated HD-MAP application resulted in stronger erythema responses on day 4, which resolved between days 22-61. Overall, these erythema responses were accompanied by an influx of immune cells in all subjects. Increased cell infiltration of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells as well as myeloid CD11b+ CD11c+ and non-myeloid CD11b- dendritic cells were observed in all subjects, but more pronounced in active HD-MAP groups. In contrast, CD19+/CD20+ B cell counts remained unchanged. Key limitations include the use of an influenza vaccine, to which the subjects may have had previous exposure. Different results might have been obtained with HD-MAPs inducing a primary immune response. In conclusion, influenza vaccine administered to the forearm (FA) using the HD-MAP was well-tolerated and induced a mild to moderate skin response with lymphocytic infiltrate at the site of application."
https://openalex.org/W3184748758,"Delayed tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment increase morbidity, mortality, expenditure, and transmission in the community. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment are essential for effective TB control. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and factors associated with patient delay among tuberculosis patients in Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia from February to April 2019. Fifteen health facilities of the study area were selected randomly and 255 TB patients who were ≥18 years of age were included. Data were collected using a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Patient delay was analyzed using the median as the cut-off value. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was fitted to identify factors associated with patient delay. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 with 95% CI was considered to declare a statistically significant association.The median (inter-quartile range) of the patient delay was 30 (15-60) days. About 56.9% of patients had prolonged patients' delay. Patient whose first contact were informal provider (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29, 3.86), presenting with weight loss (AOR: 2.53; 95%CI: 1.35, 4.74) and fatigue (AOR: 2.38; 95%CI: 1.36, 4.17) and body mass index (BMI) categories of underweight (AOR: 1.74; 95%CI: 1.01, 3.00) were independently associated with increased odds of patient delay. However, having good knowledge about TB (AOR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.76) significantly reduce patients' delay.In this study, a significant proportion of patients experienced more than the acceptable level for the patient delay. Knowledge about TB, the first action to illness, presenting symptoms, and BMI status were identified factors associated with patient delay. Hence, raising public awareness, regular training, and re-training of private and public healthcare providers, involving informal providers, and maintenance of a high index of suspicion for tuberculosis in the vulnerable population could reduce long delays in the management of TB."

Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) are increased in OSA and CAM are also implicated in the development of CVD.Do CAM (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin) have prognostic value in identifying risk of cardiovascular events in OSA?Patients with suspected OSA referred for a polysomnogram provided a fasting blood sample. Plasma levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were determined by multiplex Luminex Assay (Milliporesigma ON, Canada). Cardiovascular events were determined by deterministic linkage to provincial health databases.418 patients were included in the analysis. Mostly male (68.2%), mean age of 50.7 yrs, median AHI 16.5 events/hour, and mean BMI of 31.7 kg/m2. 36 cardiovascular events occurred in 8-yrs of follow up. Higher levels of ICAM-1 were associated with developing CVD (HR = 3.65 95% CI 1.40-9.53, 2nd and 3rd tertiles vs. 1st tertile), including in patients with OSA (HR = 3.1 95% CI 1.16-8.25). E-selectin was significantly associated with cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to severe OSA (HR = 3.31 95% CI 0.94-11.72, 2nd and 3rd tertiles vs. 1st tertile) but not in patients without moderate to severe OSA (HR = 0.67 95% CI 0.19-2.38), p-value for interaction = 0.07.In a suspected OSA cohort, patients with higher levels of ICAM-1 (>816 ng/ml) were significantly more likely to experience a cardiovascular event within 8 years after PSG. In moderate to severe OSA patients, a higher E-selectin (>36.4 ng/ml) was significantly associated with cardiovascular events."
https://openalex.org/W3186912271,"Musculoskeletal pain affects approximately 20% of the population worldwide and represents one of the leading causes of global disability. As yet, precise mechanisms underlying the development of musculoskeletal pain and transition to chronicity remain unclear, though individual factors such as sleep quality, physical activity, affective state, pain catastrophizing and psychophysical pain sensitivity have all been suggested to be involved. This study aimed to investigate whether factors at baseline could predict musculoskeletal pain intensity to an experimental delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) pain model. Demographics, physical activity, pain catastrophizing, affective state, sleep quality, isometric force production, temporal summation of pain, and psychophysical pain sensitivity using handheld and cuff algometry were assessed at baseline (Day-0) and two days after (Day-2) in 28 healthy participants. DOMS was induced on Day-0 by completing eccentric calf raises on the non-dominant leg to fatigue. On Day-2, participants rated pain on muscle contraction (visual analogue scale, VAS, 0-10cm) and function (Likert scale, 0-6). DOMS resulted in non-dominant calf pain at Day-2 (3.0±2.3cm), with significantly reduced isometric force production (P<0.043) and handheld pressure pain thresholds (P<0.010) at Day-2 compared to Day-0. Linear regression models using backward selection predicted from 39.3% (P<0.003) of VAS to 57.7% (P<0.001) of Likert score variation in DOMS pain intensity and consistently included cuff pressure pain tolerance threshold (P<0.01), temporal summation of pain (P<0.04), and age (P<0.02) as independent predictive factors. The findings indicate that age, psychological and central pain mechanistic factors are consistently associated with pain following acute muscle injury."
https://openalex.org/W3183559031,"The environmental footprint of courier, express, and parcel (CEP) logistics is significant and growing, owing to increased e-commerce. Consumer willingness to participate in the green logistics of CEPs, however, has been understudied. This study addresses this knowledge gap by surveying 155 Chinese consumers about their willingness to participate in CEP green logistics. Additionally, this research identifies some technical issues with previous survey research. Three main factors were extracted after the data were tested for reliability and validity using exploratory factor analysis with principal axis factor extraction and confirmatory factor analysis with diagonally weighted least squares. Consumer willingness is positively correlated with economic (8 items), operational (3 items), and social (3 items) factors, with a statistical significance of p < 0.001. Of all the factors, the strongest correlation, 0.67 (95% CI = 0.57, 0.75; p < 0.001; N = 155), exists between economic factors and consumer willingness. The results of a multinomial logistic regression analysis suggest that all consumers are highly unlikely to participate in economic factors, while they are highly likely to positively commit to operational and social factors. Therefore, it is recommended that the government provides monetary incentives to CEP companies to adopt green logistics, such as tax reductions and subsidies, to reduce the costs of green logistics. Meanwhile, the CEP industry could provide some direct and indirect incentives to consumers to re-use, recycle, and share materials, and to spend time learning about express enterprises' green logistics, to increase consumer participation in economic factors."
https://openalex.org/W3183969548,"The side sensitive synthetic chart was proposed to improve the performance of the synthetic chart to monitor shifts in the coefficient of variation (γ), by incorporating the side sensitivity feature where successive non-conforming samples must fall on the same side of the control limits. The existing side sensitive synthetic- γ chart is only evaluated in terms of the average run length (ARL) and expected average run length (EARL). However, the run length distribution is skewed to the right, hence the actual performance of the chart may be frequently different from what is shown by the ARL and EARL. This paper evaluates the entire run length distribution by studying the percentiles of the run length distribution. It is shown that false alarms frequently happen much earlier than the in-control ARL (ARL0), and small shifts are often detected earlier compared to the ARL1. Subsequently, this paper proposes an alternative design based on the median run length (MRL) and expected median run length (EMRL). The optimal design based on the MRL shows smaller out-of-control MRL (MRL1), which shows a quicker detection of the out-of-control condition, compared to the existing design, while the results from the optimal design based on the EMRL is similar to that of the existing designs. Comparisons with the synthetic-γ chart without side sensitivity shows that side sensitivity reduces the median number of samples required to detect a shift and reduces the variability in the run length.

Previous studies have indicated that body mass index (BMI), alcohol intake, short sleep, smoking, and lack of exercise are negatively associated with gray matter volume (GMV). Living alone has also been found to be related to GMV through lowered subjective happiness. However, to our knowledge, no GMV study has dealt with these unhealthy lifestyles simultaneously. By our analyses based on 142 healthy Japanese participants, BMI, alcohol intake, living alone, and short sleep were negatively associated with the gray-matter brain healthcare quotient (GM-BHQ), an MRI-based normalized GMV, after controlling for age, sex, and facility, not only individually but also when they were entered into a single regression model. Moreover, there were small but significant differences in the proportion of the variance for GM-BHQ explained by variables in a regression model (measured by R squared) between when these unhealthy variables were entered in an equation at the same time and when they were entered separately, with the former larger than the latter. However, smoking and lack of exercise were not significantly associated with GM-BHQ. Results indicate that some kinds of unhealthy lifestyles are somewhat harmful on their own, but may become more noxious to brain condition if practiced simultaneously, although its difference may not be large. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that overlapping unhealthy lifestyles affects the brains of healthy adults."
https://openalex.org/W3184322793,"The mortality rate of ovarian cancer is increasing and the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in tumor progression has been confirmed. von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) binds HIF-1α and mediates proteasome degradation of HIF-1α. Besides, histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) mitigates tumor growth via targeting HIF-1α, whereas underlying mechanism still requires investigation. In this research, we exposed ovarian cancer cell lines OV-90 and SKOV-3 to escalating concentrations of HDACi LBH589. As a result, cell viability was significantly suppressed and expression of HIF-1α was remarkably reduced along with decreased levels of signal molecules, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (P = 0.000). Interestingly, pVHL was expressed in a notably declining tendency (P = 0.000). Chaperone heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) was expressed in an ascending manner, whereas expression of chaperonin TCP-1α was reduced clearly (P = 0.000). Besides, co-inhibition of pVHL plus HDAC did not contribute to a remarkable difference in HIF-1α expression as compared with single HDAC inhibition. Furthermore, both cell lines were transfected with plasmids of VHL plus VHL binding protein-1 (VBP-1). Consequently, the expression of HIF-1α as well as lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) was remarkably decreased (P = 0.000). These findings indicate HDACi may repress expression of HIF-1α via inhibiting PI3K and GSK3β and promote degradation of HIF-1α via HSP70, independent of pVHL. Additionally, a sophisticated network of HDAC and chaperones may involve in pVHL quality control."
https://openalex.org/W3184657059,"Introduction Social mobility is considered as an important indicator of the economic development of a country. However, it varies widely across geographical regions and social groups in developing countries like Bangladesh. This paper intends to evaluate the intergenerational mobility in Bangladesh across generations. Methods and materials This paper considers a nationally representative sample survey of 8,403 respondents (rural: 5,436 and urban: 2,967). The male and female respondents aged 23 years and above were included in the sample. The education attainment of a son or daughter as compared to their father’s education level was considered as the measure of intergenerational mobility. Transition probability matrix and different social mobility indices were used to find out the intergenerational education mobility in Bangladesh. Results The findings reveal that approximately three-fourth (74.5%) of the respondents attained formal education, while more than half (58.3%) of the respondents’ father was illiterate. The educational status of the respondents and their father who lived in urban areas was relatively better than who lived in rural areas. It is also observed that 91.2% and 81.6% of the intergenerational class movement was upward among sons and daughters respectively. The probability of a higher educated father will have a higher educated child is higher in urban areas than in rural areas of Bangladesh. The intergenerational mobility is higher in the primary, secondary, and higher secondary educational levels, though the illiterate and higher education levels are the least mobile classes. In addition, the limiting probabilities reveal that the chance of sending sons to schools by an illiterate father is less as compared to their daughters. Such difference is more obvious in the urban areas, i.e., it is highly likely that sons of the illiterate father are also illiterate. Conclusion Bangladesh has been progressing remarkably in recent years. To keep the pace of the ongoing economic development in the country, it is necessary to give more attention to the illiterate people especially the girls who live in rural areas. The authors anticipate that the findings will be helpful for the policymakers as the relationship between inequality and intergenerational mobility is vital for several aspects of the economic development of a country."
https://openalex.org/W3185163613,"Birdwatching is one of the most sustainable types of nature-based tourism and, at the same time, a form of recreation that is developing very dynamically. Birdwatching is attracting more and more people, not only professionals, but also amateurs from many countries. Birdwatching research is still relatively embryonic, especially when compared to nature tourism or wildlife tourism. Our main aim was to determine preferences and opinions of birdwatchers visiting the largest national park in Poland, in relation to their different levels of involvement. The data were collected in 2018 from a survey of a sample of 357 Polish and foreign birdwatchers. Results showed that birdwatcher respondents were predominantly male, middle-aged, and living in a large city. An important tool described in this article is a new scale that assesses the level of involvement of individual people engaged in birdwatching activity. This scale corresponds well with the individual characteristics of birdwatchers. Most birdwatchers defined their birdwatching activity as a permanent rather than a temporary hobby and therefore considered it to be more of a lifestyle than a hobby. Engagement in birdwatching activity increased with age and frequency of trips. The two most important reasons for birding were 'to be close to nature' and 'fascination with birds'. It has been proven that the development of birdwatching in the future will require a developed infrastructure enabling interaction with the objects of observation."
https://openalex.org/W3185919452,"Blood pressure (BP) categories are useful to simplify preventions in public health, and diagnostic and treatment approaches in clinical practice. Updated evidence about the associations of BP categories with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and its subtypes is warranted.About 0.5 million adults aged 30 to 79 years were recruited from 10 areas in China during 2004-2008. The present study included 430 977 participants without antihypertension treatment, cancer, or CVD at baseline. BP was measured at least twice in a single visit at baseline and CVD deaths during follow-up were collected via registries and the national health insurance databases. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the associations between BP categories and CVD mortality. Overall, 16.3% had prehypertension-low, 25.1% had prehypertension-high, 14.1% had isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), 1.9% had isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH), and 9.1% had systolic-diastolic hypertension (SDH). During a median 10-year follow-up, 9660 CVD deaths were documented. Compared with normal, the hazard ratios (95% CI) of prehypertension-low, prehypertension-high, ISH, IDH, SDH for CVD were 1.10 (1.01-1.19), 1.32 (1.23-1.42), 2.04 (1.91-2.19), 2.20 (1.85-2.61), and 3.81 (3.54-4.09), respectively. All hypertension subtypes were related to the increased risk of CVD subtypes, with a stronger association for hemorrhagic stroke than for ischemic heart disease. The associations were stronger in younger than older adults.Prehypertension-high should be considered in CVD primary prevention given its high prevalence and increased CVD risk. All hypertension subtypes were independently associated with CVD and its subtypes mortality, though the strength of associations varied substantially."
https://openalex.org/W3186660560,"The increase of the temperature in the Red Sea basin due to global warming could have a large negative effect on its marine ecosystem. Consequently, there is a growing interest, from the scientific community and public organizations, in obtaining reliable projections of the Red Sea temperatures throughout the 21st century. However, the main tool used to do climate projections, the global climate models (GCM), may not be well suited for that relatively small region. In this work we assess the skills of the CMIP5 ensemble of GCMs in reproducing different aspects of the Red Sea 3D temperature variability. The results suggest that some of the GCMs are able to reproduce the present variability at large spatial scales with accuracy comparable to medium and high-resolution hindcasts. In general, the skills of the GCMs are better inside the Red Sea than outside, in the Gulf of Aden. Based on their performance, 8 of the original ensemble of 43 GCMs have been selected to project the temperature evolution of the basin. Bearing in mind the GCM limitations, this can be an useful benchmark once the high resolution projections are available. Those models project an averaged warming at the end of the century (2080-2100) of 3.3 ±> 0.6°C and 1.6 ±> 0.4°C at the surface under the scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively. In the deeper layers the warming is projected to be smaller, reaching 2.2 ±> 0.5°C and 1.5 ±> 0.3°C at 300 m. The projected warming will largely overcome the natural multidecadal variability, which could induce temporary and moderate decrease of the temperatures but not enough to fully counteract it. We have also estimated how the rise of the mean temperature could modify the characteristics of the marine heatwaves in the region. The results show that the average length of the heatwaves would increase ~15 times and the intensity of the heatwaves ~4 times with respect to the present conditions under the scenario RCP8.5 (10 time and 3.6 times, respectively, under scenario RCP4.5)."

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.Identified themes included the loss of social contacts because both young people developing psychosis withdrew and because friends withdrew as illness developed. Regarding recovery, a unique role was identified for friends and participants were often making conscious efforts to rebuild social networks. Mental health services were viewed as having a limited direct role in this.Supporting the development of opportunities and skills needed for social relationships following an episode of psychosis may be a useful focus."

The virus isolates were identified using an immunofluorescence assay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR). This study analyzed 11 ZIKV isolates. One isolate (0.6%) was obtained from 171 urine samples, eight (8.7%) from 92 serum samples and two from tissues of an abortive fetus. After propagation in C6/36 cells, ZIKV was titrated by plaque and focus forming unit (FFU) assays in Vero cell monolayers, and viral genomes were determined via real-time and digital RT-PCR. Plaque and FFU assay quantitations were comparable, with the amount of infectious viruses averaging 106-107 PFU or FFU/ml. Real-time RT-PCR semi-quantified the viral genome numbers, with Ct values varying from 12 to 14. Digital RT-PCR, which precisely determines the numbers of the viral genomes, consistently averaged 10-100 times higher than the number of infectious units. There was good correlation between the results of these titration methods. Therefore, the selection of a method should be based on the objectives of each research studies."
https://openalex.org/W3184265911,"The association between physical appearance and income has been of central interest in social science. However, most previous studies often measured physical appearance using classical proxies from subjective opinions based on surveys. In this study, we use novel data, called CAESAR, which contains three-dimensional (3D) whole-body scans to mitigate possible reporting and measurement errors. We demonstrate the existence of significant nonclassical reporting errors in the reported heights and weights by comparing them with measured counterparts, and show that these discrete measurements are too sparse to provide a complete description of the body shape. Instead, we use a graphical autoencoder to obtain intrinsic features, consisting of human body shapes directly from 3D scans and estimate the relationship between body shapes and family income. We also take into account a possible issue of endogenous body shapes using proxy variables and control functions. The estimation results reveal a statistically significant relationship between physical appearance and family income and that these associations differ across genders. This supports the hypothesis on the physical attractiveness premium in labor market outcomes and its heterogeneity across genders."

The study also examined if any associations remained across the two timepoints of pregnancy and postpartum.Women were interviewed during their first visit to one of three Australian public hospital antenatal clinics and re-interviewed at home six months after giving birth. A total of 1111 women completed both interviews, 583 were born in conflict-affected countries and 528 born in Australia. Associations between attitudes towards gender roles and men's use of IPV, socio-demographic characteristics and reported actual experiences of IPV were examined using bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses.Attitudes toward inequitable gender roles including those that condone men's use of IPV, and prevalence of IPV, were significantly higher (p<0.001) among women born in conflict-affected countries compared to Australia-born women. Women born in conflict-affected countries with the strongest held attitudes towards gender roles and men's use of IPV had an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 3.18 for IPV at baseline (95% CI 1.85-5.47) and an aOR of 1.83 for IPV at follow-up (95% CI 1.11-3.01). Women born in Australia with the strongest held attitudes towards gender roles and IPV had an aOR of 7.12 for IPV at baseline (95% CI 2.12-23.92) and an aOR of 10.59 for IPV at follow-up (95% CI 2.21-50.75).Our results underscore the need for IPV prevention strategies sensitively targeted to communities from conflict-affected countries, and for awareness among clinicians of gender role attitudes that may condone men's use of IPV, and the associated risk of IPV. The study supports the need for culturally informed national strategies to promote gender equality and to challenge practices and attitudes that condone men's violence in spousal relationships."
https://openalex.org/W3183824930,"Use of nicotine-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to sequester and reduce nicotine distribution to brain has been proposed as a therapeutic approach to treat nicotine addiction (the basis of tobacco use disorder). A series of monoclonal antibodies with high affinity for nicotine (nic•mAbs) was isolated from B-cells of vaccinated smokers. Genes encoding 32 unique nicotine binding antibodies were cloned, and the mAbs expressed and tested by surface plasmon resonance to determine their affinity for S-(-)-nicotine. The highest affinity nic•mAbs had binding affinity constants (KD) between 5 and 67 nM. The 4 highest affinity nic•mAbs were selected to undergo additional secondary screening for antigen-specificity, protein properties (including aggregation and stability), and functional in vivo studies to evaluate their capacity for reducing nicotine distribution to brain in rats. The 2 most potent nic•mAbs in single-dose nicotine pharmacokinetic experiments were further tested in a dose-response in vivo study. The most potent lead, ATI-1013, was selected as the lead candidate based on the results of these studies. Pretreatment with 40 and 80 mg/kg ATI-1013 reduced brain nicotine levels by 56 and 95%, respectively, in a repeated nicotine dosing experiment simulating very heavy smoking. Nicotine self-administration was also significantly reduced in rats treated with ATI-1013. A pilot rat 30-day repeat-dose toxicology study (4x200mg/kg ATI-1013) in the presence of nicotine indicated no drug-related safety concerns. These data provide evidence that ATI-1013 could be a potential therapy for the treatment of nicotine addiction."

Capillaroscopy enables visualization of the sublingual capillaries and measurement of the Perfused Boundary Region (PBR) as an estimate of the glycocalyx. Novel software enables assessment of the PBR estimated at a fixed high flow level (PBR-hf) and an overall microvascular assessment by the MicroVascular Health Score (MVHS). Damaged glycocalyx may represent microvascular damage in diabetes and assessment of its dimension might improve early cardio-renal risk stratification.To assess the associations between PBR, PBR-hf and MVHS and cardio-renal risk factors in persons with type 1 diabetes (T1D); and to compare these dimensions in persons with T1D and controls.Cross-sectional study including 161 persons with T1D stratified according to level of albuminuria and 50 healthy controls. The PBR, PBR-hf and MVHS were assessed by the GlycoCheck device (valid measurements were available in 136 (84.5%) with T1D and in all the controls). Higher PBR and PBR-hf indicate smaller glycocalyx width. Lower MVHS represents a worse microvascular health.There were no associations between PBR, PBR-hf or MVHS and the cardio-renal risk factors in persons with T1D, except for higher PBR-hf and lower MVHS in females (p = 0.01 for both). There was no difference in PBR, PBR-hf or MVHS in persons with normo-, micro- or macroalbuminuria. The PBR was higher (2.20±0.30 vs. 2.03±0.18μm; p<0.001) and MVHS lower (3.15±1.25 vs. 3.53±0.86μm; p = 0.02) in persons with T1D compared to controls (p≤0.02). After adjustment for cardio-renal risk factors the difference in PBR remained significant (p = 0.001).The endothelial glycocalyx dimension was impaired in persons with T1D compared to controls. We found no association between the endothelial glycocalyx dimension and the level of albuminuria or cardio-renal risk factors among persons with T1D. The use of the GlycoCheck device in T1D may not contribute to cardio-renal risk stratification."

However, few genes related to morphogenesis and pathogenicity of this fungal pathogen have been functionally characterized. BLASTp searches of the Aspergillus fumigatus UgmA and galatofuranosyltransferases (Galf-transferases) sequences in the F. oxysporum genome identified two genes encoding putative UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM), ugmA and ugmB, and six genes encoding putative Galf-transferase homologs. In this study, the single and double mutants of the ugmA, ugmB and gfsB were obtained. The roles of UGMs and GfsB were investigated by analyzing the phenotypes of the mutants. Our results showed that deletion of the ugmA gene led to a reduced production of galactofuranose-containing sugar chains, reduced growth and impaired conidiation of F. oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum. Most importantly, the ugmA deletion mutant lost the pathogenicity in cucumber plantlets. Although deletion of the ugmB gene did not cause any visible phenotype, deletion of both ugmA and ugmB genes caused more severe phenotypes as compared with the ΔugmA, suggesting that UgmA and UgmB are redundant and they can both contribute to synthesis of UDP-Galf. Furthermore, the ΔgfsB exhibited an attenuated virulence although no other phenotype was observed. Our results demonstrate that the galactofuranose (Galf) synthesis contributes to the cell wall integrity, germination, hyphal growth, conidiation and virulence in Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum and an ideal target for the development of new anti-Fusarium agents."
https://openalex.org/W3159987480,"Motivation signals have been shown to influence the engagement of cognitive control processes. However, most studies focus on the invigorating effect of reward prospect, rather than the reinforcing effect of reward feedback. The present study aimed to test whether people strategically adapt conflict processing when confronted with condition-specific congruency-reward contingencies in a manual Stroop task. Results show that the size of the Stroop effect can be affected by selectively rewarding responses following incongruent versus congruent trials. However, our findings also suggest important boundary conditions. Our first two experiments only show a modulation of the Stroop effect in the first half of the experimental blocks, possibly due to our adaptive threshold procedure demotivating adaptive behavior over time. The third experiment showed an overall modulation of the Stroop effect, but did not find evidence for a similar modulation on test items, leaving open whether this effect generalizes to the congruency conditions, or is stimulus-specific. More generally, our results are consistent with computational models of cognitive control and support contemporary learning perspectives on cognitive control. The findings also offer new guidelines and directions for future investigations on the selective reinforcement of cognitive control processes."

To inform tailoring of ES activities for PMTCT, we used financial diaries to understand the economic lives of women in PMTCT and examine associations between participants' finances and their R&A.We collected financial data from a stratified sample (n = 241) of HIV-positive pregnant women and new mothers enrolled in PMTCT from three clinics in Zomba, Malawi. For 30 weeks, participants met with staff to record cash and in-kind inflows and outflows. We used clinical records to calculate a measure of R&A for each participant. We summarized diary data using R and used cox proportional hazard models to examine the relationship between R&A and participant characteristics and behavior.There were 68,097 cash transactions over 30 weeks, with 10% characterized as inflows. The median value of cash inflows was US$3.54 compared with US$0.42 for cash outflows. Fewer than 7% of total transactions were considered related to PMTCT, with the majority classified as food or drink. Participants in the rural site had the lowest hazard of non-adherence. Decreased hazard of non-adherence was also linked to having dependents and years on ART. There were significant differences in cash inflows and outflows between those who were always adherent and those who were not.Financial inflows were large and erratic, whereas outflows were small but consistent. PMTCT expenses comprised a small proportion of overall expenses and focused on proper nutrition. The influence of inflows and outflows on adherence was significant but small; however, always adherent participants demonstrated smoother inflows and outflows, indicating an association between greater adherence and economic stability. Participants would benefit from interventions that bolster and stabilize their economic lives, including income generating activities in the agricultural industry and inclusion in village banks."
https://openalex.org/W3183888624,"DNA replication complexes (replisomes) frequently encounter barriers that can eject them prematurely from the genome. To avoid the lethality of incomplete DNA replication that arises from these events, bacteria have evolved ""DNA replication restart"" mechanisms to reload replisomes onto abandoned replication forks. The Escherichia coli PriA DNA helicase orchestrates this process by recognizing and remodeling replication forks and recruiting additional proteins that help to drive replisome reloading. We have identified a conserved sequence motif within a linker region of PriA that docks into a groove on the exterior of the PriA helicase domain. Alterations to the motif reduce the apparent processivity and attenuate structure-specific helicase activity in PriA, implicating the motif as a potential autoregulatory element in replication fork processing. The study also suggests that multiple PriA molecules may function in tandem to enhance DNA unwinding processivity, highlighting an unexpected similarity between PriA and other DNA helicases."

To eliminate the effect of haze, in the field of image processing, image dehazing has been studied intensively, and many advanced dehazing algorithms have been proposed. Physical model-based and deep learning-based methods are two competitive methods for single image dehazing, but it is still a challenging problem to achieve fidelity and effectively dehazing simultaneously in real hazy scenes. In this work, a mixed iterative model is proposed, which combines a physical model-based method with a learning-based method to restore high-quality clear images, and it has good performance in maintaining natural attributes and completely removing haze. Unlike previous studies, we first divide the image into different regions according to the density of haze to accurately calculate the atmospheric light for restoring haze-free images. Then, dark channel prior and DehazeNet are used to jointly estimate the transmission to promote the final clear haze-free image that is more similar to the real scene. Finally, a numerical iterative strategy is employed to further optimize the atmospheric light and transmission. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Moreover, to indicate the universality of the proposed method, we further apply it to the remote sensing datasets, which can also produce visually satisfactory results."

We used logistic regression to test for changes in prevalence from 2007-2019 and conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate between-survey differences.We found differences in both prevalence and trends between the YRBS and NSFG when limited to a comparably defined sample. Compared to the NSFG, adolescents in the YRBS were more likely to report being sexually experienced, less likely to report use of prescription methods for both sexes, and less likely to report condoms among males. Only the YRBS estimated significant declines in sexual experience for both sexes, and significant increases in prescription methods and declines in condom use among males. Differences between surveys in the prevalence of specific contraceptive methods reflected greater combined use of methods in the NSFG. We identified differences in question-wording and other aspects that may influence these differential patterns.The NSFG and YRBS produced inconsistent prevalence estimates and trends for sexual and contraceptive behaviors among in-school adolescents. Further efforts to improve these national surveillance systems are critical to inform policy and research efforts that support adolescent sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing."

The most frequent bleeding event was epistaxis, considered of low severity, and with the moderate possibility of being related to physical exercise; followed by extremity hematoma, considered of medium severity and highly related to physical exercise. In this study, there was no occurrence of bleeding events considered of high severity.Bleeding frequency in supervised physical exercise during physiotherapy in adults with thrombocytopenia undergoing HSCT is minor and relatively rare but occurs more frequently in patients with platelet count ≤10,000 /μL.

Our approach offers a simple yet powerful tool to study ensemble activity. It relies on clustering synchronous population activity (population vectors), allows the participation of neurons in different ensembles, has few parameters to tune and is computationally efficient. To validate the performance and generality of our method, we generated synthetic data, where we found that our method accurately detects neuronal ensembles for a wide range of simulation parameters. We found that our method outperforms current alternative methodologies. We used spike trains of retinal ganglion cells obtained from multi-electrode array recordings under a simple ON-OFF light stimulus to test our method. We found a consistent stimuli-evoked ensemble activity intermingled with spontaneously active ensembles and irregular activity. Our results suggest that the early visual system activity could be organized in distinguishable functional ensembles. We provide a Graphic User Interface, which facilitates the use of our method by the scientific community."

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected by predicting DEM target genes using the miRWalk database and intersecting with differential genes obtained from TCGA database for esophageal cancer. The STRING database was used to obtain protein-protein interaction (PPI) relationships to construct the DEM-DEG network. Furthermore, we selected core genes and core miRNAs associated with esophageal cancer prognosis by performing survival and univariate/multivariate COX analysis on DEMs and DEGs in the network and performed GSEA analysis on core genes alone, and finally the expression of the markers was verified by qPCR in esophageal cancer cell lines Eca109, SKGT-4 and normal esophageal epithelial cells HEEC. Nine DEMs were obtained, of which three were upregulated and six were downregulated, and 326 DEGs were obtained, of which 105 were upregulated and 221 were downregulated. Survival univariate/multivariate COX analysis revealed that five genes, ZBTB16, AQP4, ADCYAP1R1, PDGFD, and VIPR2, and two microRNAs, miR-99a-5p, and miR-508-5p, were related to esophageal cancer prognosis. GSEA analysis showed that the following genes may be involved in esophageal cancer prognosis: ZBTB16 may through the MTOR signaling pathway, AQP4 through the GNRH signaling pathway, ADCYAP1R1 through the PPAR signaling pathway, VIPR2 through the P53 signaling pathway and PDGFD through the PENTOSE-PHOSPHATE signaling pathway."

The data for this study were gathered from questionnaires of 363 consumers from eight farmers' markets in seven districts of Izmir province, Turkey. To reveal the consumer profile of the farmers' markets examined in this study, consumer segments were determined using factor and cluster analysis. Two different consumer segments-'conventional' and 'conscious'-were identified in the farmers' markets examined. 'Conventional Consumers' reflect typical consumer behaviours and give more importance to factors such as the location of and access to the market, quality and freshness of the products, activities at and around the market and the availability and variety of products. 'Conscious Consumers', in contrast, represent a group that is more sensitive about food safety. The majority of consumers (63.64%) who visited farmers' markets were from the Conscious Consumer segment. The majority of the consumers who visit farmers' markets are conscious consumers, requiring the strategies related to these markets to be revised. Farmers' markets should be improved in terms of selecting vendors, food safety, physical facilities and social activities."
https://openalex.org/W3183747390,"Several studies have found associations between higher pancreatic fat content and adverse health outcomes, such as diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, but investigations into the genetic contributions to pancreatic fat are limited. This genome-wide association study, comprised of 804 participants with MRI-assessed pancreatic fat measurements, was conducted in the ethnically diverse Multiethnic Cohort-Adiposity Phenotype Study (MEC-APS). Two genetic variants reaching genome-wide significance, rs73449607 on chromosome 13q21.2 (Beta = -0.67, P = 4.50x10 -8 ) and rs7996760 on chromosome 6q14 (Beta = -0.90, P = 4.91x10 -8 ) were associated with percent pancreatic fat on the log scale. Rs73449607 was most common in the African American population (13%) and rs79967607 was most common in the European American population (6%). Rs73449607 was also associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.89–1.00, P = 0.047) in the Population Architecture Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Study and the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM), which included substantial numbers of non-European ancestry participants (53,102 cases and 193,679 controls). Rs73449607 is located in an intergenic region between GSX1 and PLUTO , and rs79967607 is in intron 1 of EPM2A . PLUTO , a lncRNA , regulates transcription of an adjacent gene, PDX1 , that controls beta-cell function in the mature pancreas, and EPM2A encodes the protein laforin, which plays a critical role in regulating glycogen production. If validated, these variants may suggest a genetic component for pancreatic fat and a common etiologic link between pancreatic fat and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3185465965,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a serious infectious disease with a fatality of up to 30%. To identify the severity of SFTS precisely and quickly is important in clinical practice.From June to July 2020, 71 patients admitted to the Infectious Department of Joint Logistics Support Force No. 990 Hospital were enrolled in this study. The most frequently observed symptoms and laboratory parameters on admission were collected by investigating patients' electronic records. Decision trees were built to identify the severity of SFTS. Accuracy and Youden's index were calculated to evaluate the identification capacity of the models.Clinical characteristics, including body temperature (p = 0.011), the size of the lymphadenectasis (p = 0.021), and cough (p = 0.017), and neurologic symptoms, including lassitude (p<0.001), limb tremor (p<0.001), hypersomnia (p = 0.009), coma (p = 0.018) and dysphoria (p = 0.008), were significantly different between the mild and severe groups. As for laboratory parameters, PLT (p = 0.006), AST (p<0.001), LDH (p<0.001), and CK (p = 0.003) were significantly different between the mild and severe groups of SFTS patients. A decision tree based on laboratory parameters and one based on demographic and clinical characteristics were built. Comparing with the decision tree based on demographic and clinical characteristics, the decision tree based on laboratory parameters had a stronger prediction capacity because of its higher accuracy and Youden's index.Decision trees can be applied to predict the severity of SFTS."
https://openalex.org/W3185664153,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of village debt on land transfer. Based on the county-level panel data of village finance and land transfer in 90 counties and 4 economic development zones of Zhejiang Province from 2013 to 2017, this paper carried out multivariate statistical analysis and set a fixed effect model to control the endogenous influence of region and time. It found that village debt as a pressure may encourage village committees to promote rural land transfer, and then especially promote land flows into agricultural firms; as a mechanism, the burden of village organization's transactional debt (historical debt and administrative debt) is the key to promoting the rural land flow to agricultural enterprises; through further analysis, it is found that the village committee seeks ""win-win"" opportunities by intervening in land circulation to ensure the rights and interests of farmers and to obtain village benefits from them. This paper finds that this kind of push effect has the threshold, the debt will play a significant role in promoting when the debt rate is between 4.65% and 7.9%. In addition, there is regional heterogeneity in the contribution of debt, which exists only in plain, non-coastal and high-dependence areas. The results of this paper verify the view that ""community mechanism and market mechanism are embedded and supported each other in acquaintance society"" in the theory of community governance. In practice, it provides a realistic basis for policy makers to implement the policy of encouraging farmland circulation and properly deal with the problem of village debt."
https://openalex.org/W3186537423,"The objective of this study was to report post-operative complications and outcomes in canines undergoing elbow arthrodesis (EA) with fixation techniques including bone plate fixation with a non-locking dynamic compression plate (DCP), bone plate fixation with a locking plate (LCP), and external skeletal fixator (ESF). Medical records of twenty-two cases that underwent EA between January 2009-December 2019 from 8 referral hospitals including both private practice and academic institutions were reviewed. Post-operative complications were classified as either minor or major, surgical evaluations were performed 8 weeks post operatively, and a follow-up questionnaire was sent to owners. Of the total 22 cases that met inclusion criteria, a total of 19/22 cases had complications, 12 major and 7 minor. Complications reported in 8/9, 7/9, and 4/4, for the DCP, LCP, and ESF fixation groups, respectively. Mild to moderate mechanical lameness was identified at surgical evaluation in 16/22 cases. Complete radiographic bone healing was achieved after 9 weeks in 19/22 cases. Long term owner follow up was available in 14/22 cases. Owners reported a good to normal quality of life in 13/14 cases and poor in one case. The majority of owners (11/14) reported good to excellent satisfaction with the outcome irrespective of persistent lameness. This study demonstrates that successful EA can be achieved using a variety of fixation methods, but persistent lameness is expected and complication rate is high."
https://openalex.org/W3183249482,"Male partner involvement (MPI) has been recognized as a priority area to be strengthened in Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) of HIV. We explored the impact of Couple Oriented Counselling (COC) in MPI in sexual and reproductive health and associated factors.From February 2009 to October 2011, pregnant women were enrolled at their first antenatal care visit (ANC-1) and followed up until 6 months after delivery in the Mother and Child Center of the Chantal Biya Foundation within the randomized prenahtest multicentric trial. The MPI index was defined using sexual and reproductive health behaviour variables by using multiple correspondence analysis followed by mixed classification. Men were considered as highly involved if they had shared their HIV test results with their partner, had discussed on HIV or condom used, had contributed financially to ANC, had accompanied their wife to ANC or had practiced safe sex. Factors associated to MPI were investigated by the logistic model with GEE estimation approach.A total of 484 pregnant women were enrolled. The median age of the women was 27 years (IQR: 23-31) and 55.23% had a gestational age greater than 16 weeks at ANC-1. Among them, HIV prevalence was 11.9% (95% CI: 9.0-15.4). The median duration of the women's relationship with their partner was 84 months (IQR: 48-120). MPI index at 6 months after delivery was significantly greater in the COC group than the classical counselling group (14.8% vs 8,82%; p = 0,043; Fig 1). The partners of the women who participated in the COC were more likely to be involved during follow up than others (aOR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.00-2.10). Partners with no incoming activity (aOR = 2.90; 95% CI = 1.96-4.29), who did not used violence within the couple (aOR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.07-2.68), and whose partner came early for ANC-1 (aOR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.00-1.89) were more likely to be involved than others.MPI remains low in stable couples and COC improves partner involvement. Our findings also support the need of strengthening outreach towards ""stable"" couples and addressing barriers. This could go a long way to improve PMTCT outcomes in Cameroon.PRENAHTEST, NCT01494961. Registered 15 December 2011-Retrospectively registered, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01494961."
https://openalex.org/W3185208259,"In this paper, considering the far-field seismic input, an accelerogram recorded in the bedrock at Wuquan Mountain in Lanzhou city during the 2008 Wenchuan Ms8.0 earthquake was selected, and numerical dynamic analyses were conducted. The one-dimensional equivalent linear method was implemented to estimate the ground motion effects in the loess regions. Thereafter, slope topographic effects on ground motion were studied by applying the dynamic finite-element method. The results revealed the relationship between the PGA amplification coefficients and the soil layer thickness, which confirmed that the dynamic response of the sites had obvious nonlinear characteristics. The results also showed that there was an obvious difference in the dynamic magnification factor between the short-period and long-period structures. Moreover, it was found that the amplification coefficient of the observation point at the free surface was greater than the point inside the soil at the same depth, which mainly occurred in the upper slope. Through this study, the quantitative assessment of ground motion effects in loess regions can be approximately estimated, and the amplification mechanism of the far-field ground motion mechanism can be further explained. In addition to the refraction and reflection theory of seismic waves, the resonance phenomenon may help explain the slope topographic effect through spectrum analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3186730421,"The diversity of the Penaeus vannamei mitochondrial genome has still been poorly characterized, there are no validated mitochondrial markers available for populational studies, and the heteroplasmy has not yet been investigated in this species. In this study, metagenomic reads extracted from the muscle of a single individual were used to assemble the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). These data associated with mitochondrial genomes previously described allowed to evaluate the inter-individual variability and heteroplasmy. Comparison among 45 mtDNA control regions led to the detection of conserved and variable segments and the characterization of two hypervariable regions. The analysis of diversity revealed mostly low frequency polymorphisms, and heteroplasmy was found in practically all mitochondrial genes, with a high occurrence of indels. These results indicate that the design of mitochondrial markers for P . vannamei must be done with caution. The mapping of conserved and variable regions and the characterization of heteroplasmy presented here will contribute to increasing the efficiency of mitochondrial markers for population or individual studies."
https://openalex.org/W3187003391,"Few studies are available for assessing the current situation of 3D printing in veterinary medicine, due to the recent popularization of this technology. This study aimed to simulate a 3D model of the femorotibiopatellar joint of dogs based on the medial patellar luxation. The scanning, editing and printing of the femur, tibia, fibula and patella of a dog from the Laboratory of Anatomy of FMVZ USP were performed.Three femorotibiopatellar joint models were printed: one representing a healthy join without alterations; the second one with the medially deviated tibial tuberosity; and a last one representing the shifted tibial tuberosity and the trochlear sulcus flattened as consequence. The 3D edition consisted of medial rotation of the tibia and tibial tuberosity (22° against the healthy tibia), and the flatten of the medial femoral condyle (0.2 cm) and femoral trochlear groove. After printing, the corresponding measurements were taken with the alterations and the bone models were made with elastics to represent the anatomical components of the dog joint. Finally, the measurements corresponding to the distance from the patellar ligament to the lateral femoral condyle were taken in each specimen, in order to observe the change in position of the ligament according to the occurrence of the bone alterations.We printed 3D articular anatomical components of the femurotibiopatellar joint that could be valuable educational tools for the study of medial patellar luxation in dogs."
