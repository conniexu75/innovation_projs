https://openalex.org/W2088714934,"Induced pluripotent stem cells are shown to be useful for studying phenotypes relevant to familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, even though it can take decades for the disease to manifest in patients. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell cultures are being used as models for various genetic diseases, including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. Alzheimer's disease seems an unlikely candidate for such a technique, because it can take decades for the disease to manifest in patients. But here, Lawrence Goldstein and colleagues provide evidence that iPS cell technology can be used to study phenotypes that are relevant to familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Patient-derived fibroblasts were reprogrammed as iPS cells and differentiated into neurons expressing various biochemical markers of Alzheimer's disease, including elevated amyloid-β secretion. Treatment of neurons with a γ-secretase inhibitor, a type of drug considered a candidate for Alzheimer's therapy, significantly reduced both amyloid-β and phospho-tau levels. Our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis is currently limited by difficulties in obtaining live neurons from patients and the inability to model the sporadic form of the disease. It may be possible to overcome these challenges by reprogramming primary cells from patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we reprogrammed primary fibroblasts from two patients with familial Alzheimer’s disease, both caused by a duplication of the amyloid-β precursor protein gene1 (APP; termed APPDp), two with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (termed sAD1, sAD2) and two non-demented control individuals into iPSC lines. Neurons from differentiated cultures were purified with fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized. Purified cultures contained more than 90% neurons, clustered with fetal brain messenger RNA samples by microarray criteria, and could form functional synaptic contacts. Virtually all cells exhibited normal electrophysiological activity. Relative to controls, iPSC-derived, purified neurons from the two APPDp patients and patient sAD2 exhibited significantly higher levels of the pathological markers amyloid-β(1–40), phospho-tau(Thr 231) and active glycogen synthase kinase-3β (aGSK-3β). Neurons from APPDp and sAD2 patients also accumulated large RAB5-positive early endosomes compared to controls. Treatment of purified neurons with β-secretase inhibitors, but not γ-secretase inhibitors, caused significant reductions in phospho-Tau(Thr 231) and aGSK-3β levels. These results suggest a direct relationship between APP proteolytic processing, but not amyloid-β, in GSK-3β activation and tau phosphorylation in human neurons. Additionally, we observed that neurons with the genome of one sAD patient exhibited the phenotypes seen in familial Alzheimer’s disease samples. More generally, we demonstrate that iPSC technology can be used to observe phenotypes relevant to Alzheimer’s disease, even though it can take decades for overt disease to manifest in patients."
https://openalex.org/W1969027187,"The X-ray crystal structure of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is essential for the physiological control of cardiovascular function, is reported. The muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) constitute a family of G-protein-coupled receptors. These membrane proteins are targets for treatment of a broad range of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The five mAChR subtypes (M1–M5) share a high degree of sequence homology, but show marked differences in G-protein-coupling preference and physiological function. This pair of papers from Brian Kobilka's group presents the structures of two of the five subtypes. Haga et al. report the X-ray crystal structure of the M2 receptor, which is essential for the physiological control of cardiovascular function; Kruse et al. determine the structure of the M3 receptor, active in the bronchial airways and elsewhere. Comparison of the two structures reveals key differences that could potentially be exploited to develop subtype-selective drugs. The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system regulates the activity of multiple organ systems. Muscarinic receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate the response to acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves1,2,3,4,5. Their role in the unconscious regulation of organ and central nervous system function makes them potential therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. The M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor) is essential for the physiological control of cardiovascular function through activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels, and is of particular interest because of its extensive pharmacological characterization with both orthosteric and allosteric ligands. Here we report the structure of the antagonist-bound human M2 receptor, the first human acetylcholine receptor to be characterized structurally, to our knowledge. The antagonist 3-quinuclidinyl-benzilate binds in the middle of a long aqueous channel extending approximately two-thirds through the membrane. The orthosteric binding pocket is formed by amino acids that are identical in all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, and shares structural homology with other functionally unrelated acetylcholine binding proteins from different species. A layer of tyrosine residues forms an aromatic cap restricting dissociation of the bound ligand. A binding site for allosteric ligands has been mapped to residues at the entrance to the binding pocket near this aromatic cap. The structure of the M2 receptor provides insights into the challenges of developing subtype-selective ligands for muscarinic receptors and their propensity for allosteric regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2047874726,"The perspective that behavior is often driven by unconscious determinants has become widespread in social psychology. Bargh, Chen, and Burrows' (1996) famous study, in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory, was instrumental in defining this perspective. Here, we present two experiments aimed at replicating the original study. Despite the use of automated timing methods and a larger sample, our first experiment failed to show priming. Our second experiment was aimed at manipulating the beliefs of the experimenters: Half were led to think that participants would walk slower when primed congruently, and the other half was led to expect the opposite. Strikingly, we obtained a walking speed effect, but only when experimenters believed participants would indeed walk slower. This suggests that both priming and experimenters' expectations are instrumental in explaining the walking speed effect. Further, debriefing was suggestive of awareness of the primes. We conclude that unconscious behavioral priming is real, while real, involves mechanisms different from those typically assumed to cause the effect."

https://openalex.org/W2000142729,"The concept of disease-specific chemotherapy was developed a century ago. Dyes and arsenical compounds that displayed selectivity against trypanosomes were central to this work, and the drugs that emerged remain in use for treating human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying selective drug action and resistance for the development of improved HAT therapies has been recognized, but these mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here we use all five current HAT drugs for genome-scale RNA interference target sequencing (RIT-seq) screens in Trypanosoma brucei, revealing the transporters, organelles, enzymes and metabolic pathways that function to facilitate antitrypanosomal drug action. RIT-seq profiling identifies both known drug importers and the only known pro-drug activator, and links more than fifty additional genes to drug action. A bloodstream stage-specific invariant surface glycoprotein (ISG75) family mediates suramin uptake, and the AP1 adaptin complex, lysosomal proteases and major lysosomal transmembrane protein, as well as spermidine and N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis, all contribute to suramin action. Further screens link ubiquinone availability to nitro-drug action, plasma membrane P-type H(+)-ATPases to pentamidine action, and trypanothione and several putative kinases to melarsoprol action. We also demonstrate a major role for aquaglyceroporins in pentamidine and melarsoprol cross-resistance. These advances in our understanding of mechanisms of antitrypanosomal drug efficacy and resistance will aid the rational design of new therapies and help to combat drug resistance, and provide unprecedented molecular insight into the mode of action of antitrypanosomal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2006873318,"The Clinic for Special Children (CSC) has integrated biochemical and molecular methods into a rural pediatric practice serving Old Order Amish and Mennonite (Plain) children. Among the Plain people, we have used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to genetically map recessive disorders to large autozygous haplotype blocks (mean = 4.4 Mb) that contain many genes (mean = 79). For some, uninformative mapping or large gene lists preclude disease-gene identification by Sanger sequencing. Seven such conditions were selected for exome sequencing at the Broad Institute; all had been previously mapped at the CSC using low density SNP microarrays coupled with autozygosity and linkage analyses. Using between 1 and 5 patient samples per disorder, we identified sequence variants in the known disease-causing genes SLC6A3 and FLVCR1, and present evidence to strongly support the pathogenicity of variants identified in TUBGCP6, BRAT1, SNIP1, CRADD, and HARS. Our results reveal the power of coupling new genotyping technologies to population-specific genetic knowledge and robust clinical data."

https://openalex.org/W2060138967,"Two defining functional features of ion channels are ion selectivity and channel gating. Ion selectivity is generally considered an immutable property of the open channel structure, whereas gating involves transitions between open and closed channel states, typically without changes in ion selectivity. In store-operated Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels, the molecular mechanism of channel gating by the CRAC channel activator, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), remains unknown. CRAC channels are distinguished by a very high Ca(2+) selectivity and are instrumental in generating sustained intracellular calcium concentration elevations that are necessary for gene expression and effector function in many eukaryotic cells. Here we probe the central features of the STIM1 gating mechanism in the human CRAC channel protein, ORAI1, and identify V102, a residue located in the extracellular region of the pore, as a candidate for the channel gate. Mutations at V102 produce constitutively active CRAC channels that are open even in the absence of STIM1. Unexpectedly, although STIM1-free V102 mutant channels are not Ca(2+)-selective, their Ca(2+) selectivity is dose-dependently boosted by interactions with STIM1. Similar enhancement of Ca(2+) selectivity is also seen in wild-type ORAI1 channels by increasing the number of STIM1 activation domains that are directly tethered to ORAI1 channels, or by increasing the relative expression of full-length STIM1. Thus, exquisite Ca(2+) selectivity is not an intrinsic property of CRAC channels but rather a tuneable feature that is bestowed on otherwise non-selective ORAI1 channels by STIM1. Our results demonstrate that STIM1-mediated gating of CRAC channels occurs through an unusual mechanism in which permeation and gating are closely coupled."
https://openalex.org/W2094222502,"Objective The Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) is a self-report instrument assessing the specific psychopathology and key behaviors of eating disorders. This study sought to determine the prevalence of eating disturbances, and to provide psychometric properties and norms of the EDE-Q, in a representative German population sample. Methods A total of 2520 individuals (1166 men, 1354 women) were assessed with the EDE-Q. Results Eating disorder psychopathology was higher and most key behaviors were more prevalent in women than in men. Psychopathology declined with age ≥65 in both sexes, and showed a peak at age 55–64 in men. Overall, 5.9% of the women and 1.5% of the men revealed eating disturbances. The prevalence of eating disturbances decreased with age in women and was significantly higher in obese than in normal-weight individuals. Psychometric analyses showed favorable item characteristics. Internal consistencies of EDE-Q composite scores were ≥.80 for women and ≥.70 for men. The factor structure of the EDE-Q was partially reproduced. Sex- and age-specific population norms are reported. Discussion This study provides population norms of the EDE-Q for both sexes and across the age range, demonstrates demographic variations in symptomatology, and reveals satisfactory psychometric properties. Further research is warranted on eating disturbances in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2126419565,"Losses to life and property from unplanned fires (wildfires) are forecast to increase because of population growth in peri-urban areas and climate change. In response, there have been moves to increase fuel reduction—clearing, prescribed burning, biomass removal and grazing—to afford greater protection to peri-urban communities in fire-prone regions. But how effective are these measures? Severe wildfires in southern Australia in 2009 presented a rare opportunity to address this question empirically. We predicted that modifying several fuels could theoretically reduce house loss by 76%–97%, which would translate to considerably fewer wildfire-related deaths. However, maximum levels of fuel reduction are unlikely to be feasible at every house for logistical and environmental reasons. Significant fuel variables in a logistic regression model we selected to predict house loss were (in order of decreasing effect): (1) the cover of trees and shrubs within 40 m of houses, (2) whether trees and shrubs within 40 m of houses was predominantly remnant or planted, (3) the upwind distance from houses to groups of trees or shrubs, (4) the upwind distance from houses to public forested land (irrespective of whether it was managed for nature conservation or logging), (5) the upwind distance from houses to prescribed burning within 5 years, and (6) the number of buildings or structures within 40 m of houses. All fuel treatments were more effective if undertaken closer to houses. For example, 15% fewer houses were destroyed if prescribed burning occurred at the observed minimum distance from houses (0.5 km) rather than the observed mean distance from houses (8.5 km). Our results imply that a shift in emphasis away from broad-scale fuel-reduction to intensive fuel treatments close to property will more effectively mitigate impacts from wildfires on peri-urban communities."
https://openalex.org/W2068066679,"There is increasing evidence suggesting that estrogens augment skeletal muscle regeneration processes after injury. To study the contribution of estrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ) during muscle regeneration, skeletal muscles of ovariectomized (OVX) rats, as well as ERa- and ERβ-knockout (αErko and βErko) mice, were injured with a myotoxin (notexin). OVX rats were simultaneously treated with the ER-selective ligands genistein, ERα agonist 16α-LE2 (alpha), ERβ agonist 8β-VE2 (beta), or 17β-estradiol (E2). OVX rats showed significantly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity after muscle injury compared to intact sham-treated animals. Treatment with ER ligands significantly reduced CK activity. TNF-α, IL-10, and MCP-1 expression served to characterize immune responses. Treatment with all ER ligands, but particularly E2 and beta, reduced TNF-α, but elevated MCP-1 and IL-10 expression. PCNA and MyoD expression served to define satellite cell activation and proliferation and were found to be up-regulated by beta and E2. To further study muscle regeneration responses, expression of the embryonic myosin heavy chain (MHC) was analyzed. Beta and E2 but not alpha increased embryonic MHC expression compared to OVX. The absence of ERβ in βErko mice negatively affected CK activity levels and expression of satellite cell and muscle regeneration markers (MHC embryonic, MyoD, Pax7) compared with aErko and wild-type mice. In a classic Hershberger assay using male rats, beta stimulated muscle growth, accompanied by a strong induction of IGF-1 expression. Our data provide evidence that ERβ signaling is involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth and regeneration by stimulating anabolic pathways, activating satellite cells and modulating immune responses.—Velders, M., Schleipen, B., Fritzemeier, K.

https://openalex.org/W2086886614,"Cell migration is crucial for both physiological and pathological processes. Current in vitro cell motility assays suffer from various drawbacks, including insufficient temporal and/or optical resolution, or the failure to include a controlled chemotactic stimulus. Here, we address these limitations with a migration chamber that utilizes a self-sustaining chemotactic gradient to induce locomotion through confined environments that emulate physiological settings. Dynamic real-time analysis of both population-scale and single-cell movement are achieved at high resolution. Interior surfaces can be functionalized through adsorption of extracellular matrix components, and pharmacological agents can be administered to cells directly, or indirectly through the chemotactic reservoir. Direct comparison of multiple cell types can be achieved in a single enclosed system to compare inherent migratory potentials. Our novel microfluidic design is therefore a powerful tool for the study of cellular chemotaxis, and is suitable for a wide range of biological and biomedical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2000577272,"Breast cancer (BrCa) is a complex disease driven by aberrant gene alterations and environmental factors. Recent studies reveal that abnormal epigenetic gene regulation also plays an important role in its pathogenesis. Ubiquitin carboxyl- terminal esterase L1 (UCHL1) is a tumor suppressor silenced by promoter methylation in multiple cancers, but its role and alterations in breast tumorigenesis remain unclear.We found that UCHL1 was frequently downregulated or silenced in breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues, but readily expressed in normal breast tissues and mammary epithelial cells. Promoter methylation of UCHL1 was detected in 9 of 10 breast cancer cell lines (90%) and 53 of 66 (80%) primary tumors, but rarely in normal breast tissues, which was statistically correlated with advanced clinical stage and progesterone receptor status. Pharmacologic demethylation reactivated UCHL1 expression along with concomitant promoter demethylation. Ectopic expression of UCHL1 significantly suppressed the colony formation and proliferation of breast tumor cells, through inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Subcellular localization study showed that UCHL1 increased cytoplasmic abundance of p53. We further found that UCHL1 induced p53 accumulation and reduced MDM2 protein level, and subsequently upregulated the expression of p21, as well as cleavage of caspase3 and PARP, but not in catalytic mutant UCHL1 C90S-expressed cells.UCHL1 exerts its tumor suppressive functions by inducing G0/G1cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast tumorigenesis, requiring its deubiquitinase activity. Its frequent silencing by promoter CpG methylation may serve as a potential tumor marker for breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1989558511,"Seamounts shape the topography of all ocean basins and can be hotspots of biological activity in the deep sea. The Census of Marine Life on Seamounts (CenSeam) was a field program that examined seamounts as part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) initiative from 2005 to 2010. CenSeam progressed seamount science by collating historical data, collecting new data, undertaking regional and global analyses of seamount biodiversity, mapping species and habitat distributions, challenging established paradigms of seamount ecology, developing new hypotheses, and documenting the impacts of human activities on seamounts. However, because of the large number of seamounts globally, much about the structure, function and connectivity of seamount ecosystems remains unexplored and unknown. Continual, and potentially increasing, threats to seamount resources from fishing and seabed mining are creating a pressing demand for research to inform conservation and management strategies. To meet this need, intensive science effort in the following areas will be needed: 1) Improved physical and biological data; of particular importance is information on seamount location, physical characteristics (e.g. habitat heterogeneity and complexity), more complete and intensive biodiversity inventories, and increased understanding of seamount connectivity and faunal dispersal; 2) New human impact data; these shall encompass better studies on the effects of human activities on seamount ecosystems, as well as monitoring long-term changes in seamount assemblages following impacts (e.g. recovery); 3) Global data repositories; there is a pressing need for more comprehensive fisheries catch and effort data, especially on the high seas, and compilation or maintenance of geological and biodiversity databases that underpin regional and global analyses; 4) Application of support tools in a data-poor environment; conservation and management will have to increasingly rely on predictive modelling techniques, critical evaluation of environmental surrogates as faunal “proxies”, and ecological risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2102282081,"Canonical Wnt signaling critically regulates cell fate and proliferation in developmental stages and adult tissues. Redox regulation through nucleoredoxin (NRX) has recently been identified in canonical Wnt signaling. However, the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) affecting the redox state of NRX remains elusive. Our principal aim in this study was to investigate whether superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase1 (Nox1) is involved in NRX-regulated Wnt signaling in intestinal and colon epithelial cells. Here, we demonstrate that Wnt treatment of mouse intestinal cells induces production of ROS through Nox1. This Nox1 action is regulated by Rac1 GTPase through Wnt-induced activation of the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2 by Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Nox1-generated ROS oxidize and inactivate NRX, thereby releasing the NRX-dependent suppression of Wnt-β-catenin signaling through dissociation of NRX from Dvl. Nox1 small-interference RNA inhibits cell response to Wnt, including stabilization of β-catenin, expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc via the TCF transcription factor, and accelerated cell proliferation. Nox1 mediates Wnt-induced cell growth in colon cancer cells with the normal Wnt pathway, but not in APC-deficient colon cancer cells, which are constitutively active in Wnt signaling. Together, these results suggest the mediating role of Nox1 in redox-dependent regulation of canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling and provide further insight into the regulatory mechanism of the Wnt pathway.—Kajla, S., Mondol, A.

https://openalex.org/W2090197330,"Niemann-Pick C (NPC) disease is an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 gene that result in an accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/L) and impaired export of cholesterol from LE/L to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recent studies demonstrate that administration of cyclodextrin (CD) to Npc1(-/-) mice eliminates cholesterol sequestration in LE/L of many tissues, including the brain, delays neurodegeneration, and increases lifespan of the mice. We have now investigated cholesterol homeostasis in NPC1-deficient cells of the brain in response to CD. Primary cultures of neurons and glial cells from Npc1(-/-) mice were incubated for 24 h with 0.1 to 10 mm CD after which survival and cholesterol homeostasis were monitored. Although 10 mm CD was profoundly neurotoxic, and altered astrocyte morphology, 0.1 and 1 mm CD were not toxic but effectively mobilized stored cholesterol from the LE/L as indicated by filipin staining. However, 0.1 and 1 mm CD altered cholesterol homeostasis in opposite directions. The data suggest that 0.1 mm CD releases cholesterol trapped in LE/L of neurons and astrocytes and increases cholesterol availability at the ER, whereas 1 mm CD primarily extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane and reduces ER cholesterol. These studies in Npc1(-/-) neurons and astrocytes establish a dose of CD (0.1 mm) that would likely be beneficial in NPC disease. The findings are timely because treatment of NPC disease patients with CD is currently being initiated."
https://openalex.org/W2013692392,"Background We evaluated the in vitro activity of a merochlorin A, a novel compound with a unique carbon skeleton, against a spectrum of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and against previously characterized clinical and laboratory Staphylococcus aureus isolates with resistance to numerous antibiotics. Methods Merochlorin A was isolated and purified from a marine-derived actinomycete strain CNH189. Susceptibility testing for merochlorin A was performed against previously characterized human pathogens using broth microdilution and agar dilution methods. Cytotoxicity was assayed in tissue culture assays at 24 and 72 hours against human HeLa and mouse sarcoma L929 cell lines. Results The structure of as new antibiotic, merochlorin A, was assigned by comprehensive spectroscopic analysis. Merochlorin A demonstrated in vitro activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridium dificile, but not against Gram negative bacteria. In S. aureus, susceptibility was not affected by ribosomal mutations conferring linezolid resistance, mutations in dlt or mprF conferring resistance to daptomycin, accessory gene regulator knockout mutations, or the development of the vancomycin-intermediate resistant phenotype. Merochlorin A demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against MRSA. Activity was lost in the presence of 20% serum. Conclusions The unique meroterpenoid, merochlorin A demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against S. aureus and C. dificile and did not show cross-resistance to contemporary antibiotics against Gram positive organisms. The activity was, however, markedly reduced in 20% human serum. Future directions for this compound may include evaluation for topical use, coating biomedical devices, or the pursuit of chemically modified derivatives of this compound that retain activity in the presence of serum."
https://openalex.org/W1963759365,"Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of almost every aspect of eukaryotic cellular function; therefore, its destabilization is often observed in most human diseases and cancers. Consequently, developing inhibitors of the ubiquitination system for the treatment of cancer has been a recent area of interest. Currently, only a few classes of compounds have been discovered to inhibit the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and only one class is relatively selective in E1 inhibition in cells. We now report that Largazole and its ester and ketone analogs selectively inhibit ubiquitin conjugation to p27(Kip1) and TRF1 in vitro. The inhibitory activity of these small molecules on ubiquitin conjugation has been traced to their inhibition of the ubiquitin E1 enzyme. To further dissect the mechanism of E1 inhibition, we analyzed the effects of these inhibitors on each of the two steps of E1 activation. We show that Largazole and its derivatives specifically inhibit the adenylation step of the E1 reaction while having no effect on thioester bond formation between ubiquitin and E1. E1 inhibition appears to be specific to human E1 as Largazole ketone fails to inhibit the activation of Uba1p, a homolog of E1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Moreover, Largazole analogs do not significantly inhibit SUMO E1. Thus, Largazole and select analogs are a novel class of ubiquitin E1 inhibitors and valuable tools for studying ubiquitination in vitro. This class of compounds could be further developed and potentially be a useful tool in cells."

Here we describe the characterization and application of a synthetic riboswitch-based system, which comprises a mycobacterial promoter for transcriptional control and a riboswitch for translational control. The system was used to induce and repress heterologous protein overexpression reversibly, to create a conditional gene knockdown, and to control gene expression in a macrophage infection model. Unlike existing systems for controlling gene expression in Mtb, the riboswitch does not require the co-expression of any accessory proteins: all of the regulatory machinery is encoded by a short DNA segment directly upstream of the target gene. The inducible riboswitch platform has the potential to be a powerful general strategy for creating customized gene regulation systems in Mtb."
https://openalex.org/W2047930097,"Background Aberrant platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling has been associated with prostate cancer (PCa) progression. However, its role in the regulation of PCa cell growth and survival has not been well characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings Using experimental models that closely mimic clinical pathophysiology of PCa progression, we demonstrated that PDGF is a survival factor in PCa cells through upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). PDGF treatment induced rapid nuclear translocation of β-catenin, presumably mediated by c-Abl and p68 signaling. Intriguingly, PDGF promoted formation of a nuclear transcriptional complex consisting of β-catenin and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, and its binding to Mcl-1 promoter. Deletion of a putative hypoxia response element (HRE) within the Mcl-1 promoter attenuated PDGF effects on Mcl-1 expression. Blockade of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signaling with a pharmacological inhibitor AG-17 abrogated PDGF induction of Mcl-1, and induced apoptosis in metastatic PCa cells. Conclusions/Significance Our study elucidated a crucial survival mechanism in PCa cells, indicating that interruption of the PDGF-Mcl-1 survival signal may provide a novel strategy for treating PCa metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2054321342,"This study investigates the role of two different HCN channel isoforms in the light response of the outer retina. Taking advantage of HCN-deficient mice models and of in vitro (patch-clamp) and in vivo (ERG) recordings of retinal activity we show that HCN1 and HCN2 channels are expressed at distinct retinal sites and serve different functions. Specifically, HCN1 operate mainly at the level of the photoreceptor inner segment from where, together with other voltage sensitive channels, they control the time course of the response to bright light. Conversely, HCN2 channels are mainly expressed on the dendrites of bipolar cells and affect the response to dim lights. Single cell recordings in HCN1⁻/⁻ mice or during a pharmacological blockade of I(h) show that, contrary to previous reports, I(kx) alone is able to generate the fast initial transient in the rod bright flash response. Here we demonstrate that the relative contribution of I(h) and I(kx) to the rods' temporal tuning depends on the membrane potential. This is the first instance in which the light response of normal and HCN1- or HCN2-deficient mice is analyzed in single cells in retinal slice preparations and in integrated full field ERG responses from intact animals. This comparison reveals a high degree of correlation between single cell current clamp data and ERG measurements. A novel picture emerges showing that the temporal profile of the visual response to dim and bright luminance changes is separately determined by the coordinated gating of distinct voltage dependent conductances in photoreceptors and bipolar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2089424336,"Redox regulation of signaling molecules contributes critically to propagation of intracellular signals. The main source providing reactive oxygen species (ROS) for these physiological processes are activated NADPH oxidases (Nox/Duox family). In a pathophysiological context, some NADPH oxidase complexes produce large amounts of ROS either as part of the antimicrobial immune defense or as pathologic oxidative stress in many chronic diseases. Thus, understanding the switch from a dormant, inactive conformation to the active state of these enzymes will aid the development of inhibitors. As exogenously expressed Nox4 represents the only constitutively active enzyme in this family, analysis of structural determinants that permit this active conformation was undertaken. Our focus was directed toward a cell-based analysis of the first intracellular loop, the B-loop, and the C-terminus, two regions of Nox family enzymes that are essential for electron transfer. Mutagenesis of the B-loop identified several unique residues and a polybasic motif that contribute to the catalytic activity of Nox4. By using a multifaceted approach, including Nox4-Nox2 chimeras, mutagenesis, and insertion of Nox2 domains, we show here that the penultimate 22 amino acids of Nox4 are involved in constitutive ROS generation. The appropriate spacing of the C-terminal Nox4 sequence may cooperate with a discrete arginine-based interaction site in the B-loop, providing an intrinsically active interface that could not be disrupted by peptides derived from the Nox4 C-terminus. These results indicate that accessibility for a Nox4-specific peptide inhibitor might be difficult to achieve in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2088224519,"Background Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the main causative agent of Hand, Foot and Mouth disease (HFMD) and is associated with severe neurologic complications and mortalities. At present, there is no vaccine or therapeutic available for treatment. Methodology/Principal Finding In this study, we generated two mAbs, denoted as mAb 51 and 53, both targeting the same linear epitope on VP1 capsid protein, spanning amino acids 215–219. In comparison, mAb 51 belonging to isotype IgM possesses neutralizing activity in vitro, whereas, mAb 53 belonging to isotype IgG1 does not have any neutralizing ability, even towards its homologous strain. When mAb 51 at 10 µg/g of body weight was administered to the 2-week-old AG129 mice one day prior to lethal challenge, 100% in vivo passive protection was observed. In contrast, the isotype control group mice, injected with an irrelevant IgM antibody before the challenge, developed limb paralysis as early as day 6 post-infection. Histological examination demonstrated that mAb 51 was able to protect against pathologic changes such as neuropil vacuolation and neuronal loss in the spinal cord, which were typical in unprotected EV-71 infected mice. BLAST analyses of that epitope revealed that it was highly conserved among all EV71 strains, but not coxsachievirus 16 (CA16). Conclusion We have defined a linear epitope within the VP1 protein and demonstrated its neutralizing ability to be isotype dependent. The neutralizing property and highly conserved sequence potentiated the application of mAb 51 and 53 for protection against EV71 infection and diagnosis respectively."

Both Seine and Sedlo heterotrophic community (abundance and biomass) dominate during winter and summer months, representing 75% (Sedlo, July) to 86% (Seine, November) of the total plankton biomass. In Seine, during springtime the contribution to total plankton biomass is similar (47% autotrophic and 53% heterotrophic). Both seamounts present an autotrophic community structure dominated by small cells (nano and picophytoplankton). It is also during spring that a relatively important contribution (26%) of large cells to total autotrophic biomass is found. In some cases, a “seamount effect” is observed on Seine and Sedlo microbial community structure and biomass. In Seine this is only observed during spring through enhancement of large autotrophic cells at the summit and seamount stations. In Sedlo, and despite the observed low biomasses, some clear peaks of picoplankton at the summit or at stations within the seamount area are also observed during summer. Our results suggest that the dominance of heterotrophs is presumably related to the trapping effect of organic matter by seamounts. Nevertheless, the complex circulation around both seamounts with the presence of different sources of mesoscale variability (e.g. presence of meddies, intrusion of African upwelling water) may have contributed to the different patterns of distribution, abundances and also changes observed in the microbial community."
https://openalex.org/W2025508164,"Cell wall metabolism and cell wall modification are very important processes that bacteria use to adjust to various environmental conditions. One of the main modifications is deacetylation of peptidoglycan. The polysaccharide deacetylase homologue, Bacillus subtilis YjeA (renamed PdaC), was characterized and found to be a unique deacetylase. The pdaC deletion mutant was sensitive to lysozyme treatment, indicating that PdaC acts as a deacetylase. The purified recombinant and truncated PdaC from Escherichia coli deacetylated B. subtilis peptidoglycan and its polymer, (-GlcNAc-MurNAc[-L-Ala-D-Glu]-)(n). Surprisingly, RP-HPLC and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that the enzyme deacetylates N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) not GlcNAc from the polymer. Contrary to Streptococcus pneumoniae PgdA, which shows high amino acid sequence similarity with PdaC and is a zinc-dependent GlcNAc deacetylase toward peptidoglycan, there was less dependence on zinc ion for deacetylation of peptidoglycan by PdaC than other metal ions (Mn(2+), Mg(2+), Ca(2+)). The kinetic values of the activity toward B. subtilis peptidoglycan were K(m) = 4.8 mM and k(cat) = 0.32 s(-1). PdaC also deacetylated N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligomers with a K(m) = 12.3 mM and k(cat) = 0.24 s(-1) toward GlcNAc(4). Therefore, PdaC has GlcNAc deacetylase activity toward GlcNAc oligomers and MurNAc deacetylase activity toward B. subtilis peptidoglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2090847232,"The recently identified, fungi-specific alternative pathway of glutathione degradation requires the participation of three genes, DUG1, DUG2, and DUG3. Dug1p has earlier been shown to function as a Cys-Gly-specific dipeptidase. In the present study, we describe the characterization of Dug2p and Dug3p. Dug3p has a functional glutamine amidotransferase (GATase) II domain that is catalytically important for glutathione degradation as demonstrated through mutational analysis. Dug2p, which has an N-terminal WD40 and a C-terminal M20A peptidase domain, has no peptidase activity. The previously demonstrated Dug2p-Dug3p interaction was found to be mediated through the WD40 domain of Dug2p. Dug2p was also shown to be able to homodimerize, and this was mediated by its M20A peptidase domain. In vitro reconstitution assays revealed that Dug2p and Dug3p were required together for the cleavage of glutathione into glutamate and Cys-Gly. Purification through gel filtration chromatography confirmed the formation of a Dug2p-Dug3p complex. The functional complex had a molecular weight that corresponded to (Dug2p-Dug3p)(2) in addition to higher molecular weight oligomers and displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. (Dug2p-Dug3p)(2) had a K(m) for glutathione of 1.2 mm, suggesting a novel GATase enzyme that acted on glutathione. Dug1p activity in glutathione degradation was found to be restricted to its Cys-Gly peptidase activity, which functioned downstream of the (Dug2p-Dug3p)(2) GATase. The DUG2 and DUG3 genes, but not DUG1, were derepressed by sulfur limitation. Based on these studies and the functioning of GATases, a mechanism is proposed for the functioning of the Dug proteins in the degradation of glutathione."
https://openalex.org/W1974233947,"Therapeutic resistance remains the most challenging aspect of treating cancer. Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) emerged as a molecule capable of sensitizing cancerous cells to radio- and chemotherapy. Moreover, this small evolutionary conserved molecule, endows significant resistance to cancer therapy when its expression is reduced or lost. RKIP has been shown to inhibit the Raf-MEK-ERK, NFκB, GRK and activate the GSK3β signaling pathways. Inhibition of Raf-MEK-ERK and NFκB remains the most prominent pathways implicated in the sensitization of cells to therapeutic drugs. Our purpose was to identify a possible link between RKIP-KEAP 1-NRF2 and drug resistance. To that end, RKIP-KEAP 1 association was tested in human colorectal cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry. RKIP miRNA silencing and its inducible overexpression were employed in HEK-293 immortalized cells, HT29 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines to further investigate our aim. We show that RKIP enhanced Kelch-like ECH-associated protein1 (KEAP 1) stability in colorectal cancer tissues and HT29 CRC cell line. RKIP silencing in immortalized HEK-293 cells (termed HEK-499) correlated significantly with KEAP 1 protein degradation and subsequent NRF2 addiction in these cells. Moreover, RKIP depletion in HEK-499, compared to control cells, bestowed resistance to supra physiological levels of H(2)O(2) and Cisplatin possibly by upregulating NF-E2-related nuclear factor 2 (NRF2) responsive genes. Similarly, we observed a direct correlation between the extent of apoptosis, after treatment with Adriamycin, and the expression levels of RKIP/KEAP 1 in HT29 but not in HCT116 CRC cells. Our data illuminate, for the first time, the NRF2-KEAP 1 pathway as a possible target for personalized therapeutic intervention in RKIP depleted cancers."

We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen for novel cofactors, and identified an interaction between the C-terminal domain of LCoR and the transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), a putative tumor suppressor in prostate cancer. Subsequent experiments revealed LCoR regulation of several KLF6 target genes notably p21WAF1/CIP1 (CDKN1A) and to a lesser extent E-cadherin (CDH1), indicating that LCoR regulates gene transcription through multiple classes of transcription factors. In multiple cancer cells, LCoR and KLF6 bind together on the promoters of the genes encoding CDKN1A and CDH1. LCoR contributes to KLF6-mediated transcriptional repression in a promoter- and cell type-dependent manner. Its inhibition of reporter constructs driven by the CDKN1A and CDH1 promoters in PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells is sensitive to treatment with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. Additionally, the LCoR cofactor CtBP1 bound the same promoters and augmented the LCoR-dependent repression in PC-3 cells. Consistent with their inferred roles in transcriptional repression, siRNA-mediated knockdown of KLF6, LCoR, or CtBP1 in PC-3 cells induced expression of CDKN1A and CDH1 and additional KLF6 target genes. We propose a novel model of LCoR function in which promoter-bound KLF6 inhibits transcription of the CDKN1A gene and other genes as well by tethering a transcriptional corepressor complex containing LCoR, with specific contributions by CtBP1 and HDACs.

https://openalex.org/W2118446587,"Most presently known breast cancer susceptibility genes have been linked to DSB repair. To identify novel markers that may serve as indicators for breast cancer risk, we performed DSB repair analyses using a case-control design. Thus, we examined 35 women with defined familial history of breast and/or ovarian cancer (first case group), 175 patients with breast cancer (second case group), and 245 healthy women without previous cancer or family history of breast cancer (control group). We analyzed DSB repair in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) by a GFP-based test system using 3 pathway-specific substrates. We found increases of microhomology-mediated nonhomologous end joining (mmNHEJ) and nonconservative single-strand annealing (SSA) in women with familial risk vs. controls (P=0.0001-0.0022) and patients with breast cancer vs. controls (P=0.0004-0.0042). Young age (<50) at initial diagnosis of breast cancer, which could be indicative of genetic predisposition, was associated with elevated SSA using two different substrates, amounting to similar odds ratios (ORs=2.54-4.46, P= 0.0059-0.0095) as for familial risk (ORs=2.61-4.05, P=0.0007-0.0045). These findings and supporting validation data underscore the great potential of detecting distinct DSB repair activities in PBLs as method to estimate breast cancer susceptibility beyond limitations of genotyping and to predict responsiveness to therapeutics targeting DSB repair-dysfunctional tumors.—Keimling, M., Deniz, M., Varga, D., Stahl, A., Schrezenmeier, H., Kreienberg, R., Hoffmann, I., König, J., Wiesmüller, L.

https://openalex.org/W2103935234,"Impaired insulin action in the brain represents an early step in the progression toward type 2 diabetes, and elevated levels of saturated free fatty acids are known to impair insulin action in prediabetic subjects. One potential mediator that links fatty acids to inflammation and insulin resistance is the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. Therefore, C3H/HeJ/TLR2-KO (TLR2/4-deficient) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and insulin action in the brain as well as cortical and locomotor activity was analyzed by using telemetric implants. TLR2/4-deficient mice were protected from HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the brain and displayed an improvement in cortical and locomotor activity that was not observed in C3H/HeJ mice. Sleep recordings revealed a 42% increase in rapid eye movement sleep in the deficient mice during daytime, and these mice spent 41% more time awake during the night period. Treatment of control mice with a neutralizing IL-6 antibody improved insulin action in the brain as well as cortical activity and diminished osteopontin protein to levels of the TLR2/4-deficient mice. Together, our data suggest that the lack of functional TLR2/4 protects mice from a fat-mediated impairment in insulin action, brain activity, locomotion, and sleep architecture by an IL-6/osteopontin-dependent mechanism.—Sartorius, T., Lutz, S.

https://openalex.org/W2091763056,"Burgess Shale-type deposits provide invaluable insights into the early evolution of body plans and the ecological structure of Cambrian communities, but a number of species, continue to defy phylogenetic interpretations. Here we extend this list to include a new soft-bodied animal, Siphusauctum gregarium n. gen. and n. sp., from the Tulip Beds (Campsite Cliff Shale Member, Burgess Shale Formation) of Mount Stephen (Yoho National Park, British Columbia). With 1,133 specimens collected, S. gregarium is clearly the most abundant animal from this locality.This stalked animal (reaching at least 20 cm in length), has a large ovoid calyx connected to a narrow bilayered stem and a small flattened or bulb-like holdfast. The calyx is enclosed by a flexible sheath with six small openings at the base, and a central terminal anus near the top encircled by indistinct openings. A prominent organ, represented by six radially symmetrical segments with comb-like elements, surrounds an internal body cavity with a large stomach, conical median gut and straight intestine. Siphusauctum gregarium was probably an active filter-feeder, with water passing through the calyx openings, capturing food particles with its comb-like elements. It often occurs in large assemblages on single bedding planes suggesting a gregarious lifestyle, with the animal living in high tier clusters. These were probably buried en masse more or less in-situ by rapid mud flow events.Siphusauctum gregarium resembles Dinomischus, another Cambrian enigmatic stalked animal. Principal points of comparison include a long stem with a calyx containing a visceral mass and bract-like elements, and a similar lifestyle albeit occupying different tiering levels. The presence in both animals of a digestive tract with a potential stomach and anus suggest a grade of organization within bilaterians, but relationships with extant phyla are not straightforward. Thus, the broader affinities of S. gregarium remain largely unconstrained."
https://openalex.org/W2143838747,"Urea carboxylase (UC) is conserved in many bacteria, algae, and fungi and catalyzes the conversion of urea to allophanate, an essential step in the utilization of urea as a nitrogen source in these organisms. UC belongs to the biotin-dependent carboxylase superfamily and shares the biotin carboxylase (BC) and biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domains with these other enzymes, but its carboxyltransferase (CT) domain is distinct. Currently, there is no information on the molecular basis of catalysis by UC. We report here the crystal structure of the Kluyveromyces lactis UC and biochemical studies to assess the structural information. Structural and sequence analyses indicate the CT domain of UC belongs to a large family of proteins with diverse functions, including the Bacillus subtilis KipA-KipI complex, which has important functions in sporulation regulation. A structure of the KipA-KipI complex is not currently available, and our structure provides a framework to understand the function of this complex. Most interestingly, in the structure the CT domain interacts with the BCCP domain, with biotin and a urea molecule bound at its active site. This structural information and our follow-up biochemical experiments provided molecular insights into the UC carboxyltransfer reaction. Several structural elements important for the UC carboxyltransfer reaction are found in other biotin-dependent carboxylases and might be conserved within this family, and our data could shed light on the mechanism of catalysis of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2058312353,"Bax is kept inactive in the cytosol by refolding its C-terminal transmembrane domain into the hydrophobic binding pocket. Although energetic calculations predicted this conformation to be stable, numerous Bax binding proteins were reported and suggested to further stabilize inactive Bax. Unfortunately, most of them have not been validated in a physiological context on the endogenous level. Here we use gel filtration analysis of the cytosol of primary and established cells to show that endogenous, inactive Bax runs 20-30 kDa higher than recombinant Bax, suggesting Bax dimerization or the binding of a small protein. Dimerization was excluded by a lack of interaction of differentially tagged Bax proteins and by comparing the sizes of dimerized recombinant Bax with cytosolic Bax on blue native gels. Surprisingly, when analyzing cytosolic Bax complexes by high sensitivity mass spectrometry after anti-Bax immunoprecipitation or consecutive purification by gel filtration and blue native gel electrophoresis, we detected only one protein, called p23 hsp90 co-chaperone, which consistently and specifically co-purified with Bax. However, this protein could not be validated as a crucial inhibitory Bax binding partner as its over- or underexpression did not show any apoptosis defects. By contrast, cytosolic Bax exhibits a slight molecular mass shift on SDS-PAGE as compared with recombinant Bax, which suggests a posttranslational modification and/or a structural difference between the two proteins. We propose that in most healthy cells, cytosolic endogenous Bax is a monomeric protein that does not necessarily need a binding partner to keep its pro-apoptotic activity in check."

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts from these mice retain an apoptotic response to DNA damage. Mutant human MutSα proteins MSH2(G674A)-MSH6(wt) and MSH2(wt)-MSH6(T1219D) are profiled in a variety of functional assays and as expected fail to support MMR in vitro, although they retain mismatch recognition activity. Kinetic analyses of DNA binding and ATPase activities and examination of the excision step of MMR reveal that the two mutants differ in their underlying molecular defects. MSH2(wt)-MSH6(T1219D) fails to couple nucleotide binding and mismatch recognition, whereas MSH2(G674A)-MSH6(wt) has a partial defect in nucleotide binding. Nevertheless, both mutant proteins remain bound to the mismatch and fail to promote efficient excision thereby inhibiting MMR in vitro in a dominant manner. Implications of these findings for MMR and DNA damage signaling by MMR proteins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2144370333,"Background Copper is an important regulator of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) dependent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, and is also required for the activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX) to effect matrix protein cross-linking. Cell detachment from the extracellular matrix can induce apoptosis (anoikis) via inactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Methodology To examine the molecular mechanisms whereby copper depletion causes the destruction of the normal alveolar architecture via anoikis, Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a copper deficient diet for 6 weeks while being treated with the copper chelator, tetrathiomolybdate. Other groups of rats were treated with the inhibitor of auto-phosphorylation of FAK, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride (1,2,4,5-BT) or FAK small interfering RNA (siRNA). Principal Findings Copper depletion caused emphysematous changes, decreased HIF-1α activity, and downregulated VEGF expression in the rat lungs. Cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) expression was increased, and the phosphorylation of FAK was decreased in copper depleted rat lungs. Administration of 1,2,4,5-BT and FAK siRNA caused emphysematous lung destruction associated with increased expression of cleaved capase-3, caspase-8 and Bim. Conclusions These data indicate that copper-dependent mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of emphysema, which may be associated with decreased HIF-1α and FAK activity in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2129170520,"We have previously found that in failing human hearts, Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) is processed by caspase-3 into an active isoform, ROCKΔ1. The purpose of the current investigation was to elucidate the pathological consequences of truncated ROCK1 accumulation in the heart, the associated molecular mechanism of ROCKΔ1-mediated cardiac phenotype, and the molecular signaling between Rho kinase activation in cardiomyocytes and extracellular matrix response. We generated transgenic mice expressing ROCKΔ1 in cardiomyocytes to mimic the situation observed in human heart disease, whereas an additional kinase-deficient mouse was generated as a control. The ROCKΔ1 transgenic mice developed fibrotic cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction. Transgenic hearts displayed activated TGFβ1 and NF-κB signaling and a release of a subset of cytokines and were susceptible to angiotensin II stress. Treatment with a Rho kinase inhibitor attenuated the fibrotic phenotype. Cardiac fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts when cocultured with transgenic cardiomyocytes but not with wild-type cardiomyocytes. Inhibitors of Rho kinase as well as TGFβR1 and NF-κB decreased these effects. The serum response factor-dependent TGFβ1 regulation was shown to be responsible for the Rho kinase-mediated activation of TGFβ1 signaling. We conclude that ROCKΔ1 is a novel fibrotic factor. Activation of TGFβ1 and NF-κB signaling contributes to the Rho kinase-mediated pathological fibrosis.—Yang, X., Li, Q., Lin, X., Ma, Y., Yue, X., Tao, Z., Wang, F., Mckeehan, W.

https://openalex.org/W2010951350,"The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of regulatory signaling molecules that interact with other proteins in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and function as adapter or scaffold proteins in signal transduction pathways. One family member, 14-3-3ζ, is believed to function in cell signaling, cycle control, and apoptotic death. A systematic proteomic analysis done in our laboratory has identified signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3) as a novel 14-3-3ζ interacting protein. Following our initial finding, in this study, we provide evidence that 14-3-3ζ interacts physically with Stat3. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation of Stat3 at Ser727 is vital for 14-3-3ζ interaction and mutation of Ser727 to Alanine abolished 14-3-3ζ/Stat3 association. Inhibition of 14-3-3ζ protein expression in U266 cells inhibited Stat3 Ser727 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and decreased both Stat3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Moreover, 14-3-3ζ is involved in the regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity and 14-3-3ζ binding to Stat3 protects Ser727 dephosphorylation from protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Taken together, our findings support the model that multiple signaling events impinge on Stat3 and that 14-3-3ζ serves as an essential coordinator for different pathways to regulate Stat3 activation and function in MM cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044802789,"Targets of bioactive sphingolipids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were previously identified using microarray experiments focused on sphingolipid-dependent responses to heat stress. One of these heat-induced genes is the serine deamidase/dehydratase Cha1 known to be regulated by increased serine availability. This study investigated the hypothesis that sphingolipids may mediate the induction of Cha1 in response to serine availability. The results showed that inhibition of de novo synthesis of sphingolipids, pharmacologically or genetically, prevented the induction of Cha1 in response to increased serine availability. Additional studies implicated the sphingoid bases phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine as the likely mediators of Cha1 up-regulation. The yeast protein kinases Pkh1 and Pkh2, known sphingoid base effectors, were found to mediate CHA1 up-regulation via the transcription factor Cha4. Because the results disclosed a role for sphingolipids in negative feedback regulation of serine metabolism, we investigated the effects of disrupting this mechanism on sphingolipid levels and on cell growth. Intriguingly, exposure of the cha1Δ strain to high serine resulted in hyperaccumulation of endogenous serine and in turn a significant accumulation of sphingoid bases and ceramides. Under these conditions, the cha1Δ strain displayed a significant growth defect that was sphingolipid-dependent. Together, this work reveals a feedforward/feedback loop whereby the sphingoid bases serve as sensors of serine availability and mediate up-regulation of Cha1 in response to serine availability, which in turn regulates sphingolipid levels by limiting serine accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2164673467,"Activation of CaMKII by calmodulin and the subsequent maintenance of constitutive activity through autophosphorylation at threonine residue 286 (Thr286) are thought to play a major role in synaptic plasticity. One of the effects of autophosphorylation at Thr286 is to increase the apparent affinity of CaMKII for calmodulin, a phenomenon known as ""calmodulin trapping"". It has previously been suggested that two binding sites for calmodulin exist on CaMKII, with high and low affinities, respectively. We built structural models of calmodulin bound to both of these sites. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that while binding of calmodulin to the supposed low-affinity binding site on CaMKII is compatible with closing (and hence, inactivation) of the kinase, and could even favour it, binding to the high-affinity site is not. Stochastic simulations of a biochemical model showed that the existence of two such binding sites, one of them accessible only in the active, open conformation, would be sufficient to explain calmodulin trapping by CaMKII. We can explain the effect of CaMKII autophosphorylation at Thr286 on calmodulin trapping: It stabilises the active state and therefore makes the high-affinity binding site accessible. Crucially, a model with only one binding site where calmodulin binding and CaMKII inactivation are strictly mutually exclusive cannot reproduce calmodulin trapping. One of the predictions of our study is that calmodulin binding in itself is not sufficient for CaMKII activation, although high-affinity binding of calmodulin is."

However, there is evidence that cognitive decline correlates better with synaptic changes than with the eventual neuronal death. For example, no significant neuronal death was observed at the onset of cognitive decline in the Tg2576 APPSw mice (4.Irizarry M.C. McNamara M. Fedorchak K. Hsiao K. Hyman B.T. APPSw transgenic mice develop age-related Aβ deposits and neuropil abnormalities, but no neuronal loss in CA1.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss or dystrophy of neurites is a common feature of several neurodegenerative processes such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (5.Schmidt E.R. Pasterkamp R.J. van den Berg L.H. Axon guidance proteins: novel therapeutic targets for ALS?.Progress Neurobiol. 2009; 88: 286-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6.Jellinger K.A. Formation and development of Lewy pathology: a critical update.J. Neurol. 2009; 256: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, development of an assay, which would allow identification of new classes of molecules capable of protecting neurites will be very useful for many areas of neurodegeneration. In the present report, we have focused on the development of a NeuriteIQ HCS pipeline and show its use in reliably screening and characterizing small molecules that are protective against Aβ-induced neurite loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of HCS and analysis to systematically and specifically identify drugs that prevent neurite loss caused by Aβ in primary neurons. amyloid-β peptide amyloid precursor protein Alzheimer disease non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cyclooxygenase-1/2 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ high content screening average neurite length peroxisome proliferator response element Ras homolog gene family member A. We used the NINDS library of known bioactive compounds for our screen, as the knowledge of targets of many compounds in this library would provide new insights into the mechanisms of regulation of neurite loss. Furthermore, because the library includes FDA-approved drugs, it may reveal promising molecules for expedited development. Our results point to the role of cyclooxygenases in Aβ-induced neurite loss. Cyclooxygenases are enzymes regulating synthesis of prostaglandins. NSAID inhibitors of COX enzymes are widely used as anti-inflammatory drugs. Interestingly, NSAIDs, inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2, have been widely tested for AD (including multiple clinical trials). The results were inconsistent with both positive effects and no benefits being reported (7.Szekely C.A. Zandi P.P. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Alzheimer disease: the epidemiological evidence.CNS Neurological Disorders Drug Targets. 2010; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the mechanisms of NSAIDs' function remain controversial. The rationale for testing NSAIDs in previous studies was to target neuroinflammation, rather than protection against Αβ-induced neurite loss. Our data reveal neurite protection as a general mechanism of activity of NSAIDs, which should be considered in future re-evaluation of the potential of this important class of drugs as treatments for AD. Neurons were obtained as described (8.Zhang Y. Zhou X. Degterev A. Lipinski M. Adjeroh D. Yuan J. Wong S.T. A novel tracing algorithm for high throughput imaging. Screening of neuron-based assays.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 160: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, C57BL/6 mouse embryo (E15) brains were dissected and trypsinized at room temperature (RT), followed by trituration. Neurons were resuspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine, and seeded in 384-well plates at 1 × 104 cells/well. The following day medium was changed to neurobasal with B27, penicillin/streptomycin, and glutamine and incubated for 4 days. Following treatment, neurons were incubated (37 °C) for 3 days before fixation and staining. Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were dissolved in water at 400 μm and pre-formed fibrils were separated by centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Soluble fractions were diluted in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) to 200 μm, incubated for 1–4 h (37 °C) and added to the cells after dilution with neurobasal media to a final concentration of 5 μm. For the analysis of Aβ oligomers, the aliquots of peptides were immediately put on ice following aggregation, and 3 mm thioflavin T in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5) buffer prechilled at 4 °C was added. Fluorescence of the samples was determined using fluorescence spectrophotometer F2500 (Hitachi) at λex of 443 nm and λem of 484 nm. Fluorescence of 500 μl aliquot of 3 mm thioflavin T solution was subtracted as a blank. Average levels of fluorescence in three independent experiments were analyzed. Following the ThT assay, the oligomeric species were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm ammonium acetate pH 8.5 buffer using AKTA purifier 10 (GE Healthcare). Fractions from the column were analyzed by Western blot using the 6E10 antibody (Covance). The results are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min (room temperature). Cells were permeabilized with 10% normal donkey serum and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 min (room temperature). Primary TUJ1 antibody, and secondary donkey anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated antibody were used to stain neurons; nuclei were stained with Sytox Green. Neurons were imaged on automated CellWorx microscope (Applied Precision) at 10× magnification and 488 nm (Sytox Green) and 550 nm (Cy3) wavelengths. We developed the NeuriteIQ software to obtain accurate quantification of neurite lengths in high density neuronal cultures. The software provides an automated pipeline for quantitative interpretation of automatic fluorescence microscopy images, in particular, for the labeling and measurement of neurites. The details of the algorithm are described in detail in Ref. 9.Huang Y. Zhou X. Miao B. Lipinski M. Zhang Y. Li F. Degterev A. Yuan J. Hu G. Wong S.T. A computational framework for studying neuron morphology from in vitro high content neuron-based screening.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2010; 190: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, and steps in analysis are shown in Fig. 1C. Briefly, to obtain statistical quantifications from neuronal images, NeuriteIQ processes images from Nuclei and Neurite channels separately. In the nuclei channel, total cell number is calculated by image segmentation with local maximum points detection, which separates all the cells from the background, and separates clumped cells from each other based on a watershed method. By comparing with the soma areas detected from corresponding neuron specific image, selection of neurons from non-neuronal cells in the image is performed, providing an accurate neuronal cell number in the whole well. In the neuron/neurite channel, NeuriteIQ detects soma areas with clustering pixels and higher intensity than adjacent areas. Neurites are then treated as two-dimensional curvilinear structures, which could be detected based on the local Hessian matrix. The Hessian matrix describes the local curvature of a curvilinear structure, which is an useful algorithm that allows detection the center points and local directions of neurite in a field. Subsequently, a specific neurite is detected from a seed point, which is defined as an initial point on or near the center line of a dendritic segment and soma. Therefore, a specific dendrite could be ascribed to a specific nucleus by its seed point. Identification of seed points for each neurite minimizes interference from positively stained debris. The tracking algorithm then detects center points along each neurite, and defines the possible direction of neurites from each center point. After calculating the center points and their directions, centerlines could be extracted along neurites by linking detected center points along the local directions, which display curvilinear structures. In case of breaks between near branching structures, a predefined radius r is set up to determine whether two end points of different centerlines should be linked together. If one of the end points is in the local direction of another centerline, and the distance between two end points is in the range of r, those two points are linked to fill the break. Bresenham line drawing algorithm is applied to link these two points. This allows us to solve the neurite line break problem during the post-processing of images. NeuriteIQ provides a statistical quantification of the total neurite length in one image, which is subsequently used to calculate Average Neurite Length (ANL) as the statistical feature of neurite outgrowth in each well. ANL is defined as a ratio between Total Neurite Length per image and Neuron Cell Numbers. ANL is a statistical parameter, which averages the neurite lengths in the entire neuronal field and makes the analysis results resistant to slight changes in the neuron culture and staining as well as local variations in cell density and errors in tracing of individual neurites due to high cell density. ANL calculations are described in detail in Ref. 10.Loh S.H. Francescut L. Lingor P. Bähr M. Nicotera P. Identification of new kinase clusters required for neurite outgrowth and retraction by a loss-of-function RNA interference screen.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. Because both of the total neurite length and neuron cell number are statistical results averaged over entire image, ANL is a robust measure of neurite outgrowth which is highly accurate and reproducible even in high density cultures. Thus, NeuriteIQ is a fully automated tool for batch processing a large dataset of images without human intervention such as selecting start points of neurites, defining directions for neurite tracking in a branch, etc, which makes NeuriteIQ an efficient tool in dealing with large scale dataset for compound screening. We have made NeuriteIQ public, and it can be downloaded for free along with user documentation on the web. Finally, Z′-factors of ANL (average neurite length) and ANB (average neurite brightness, which is defined as the ratio between the total brightness (intensity) of all neurite pixels and the total length of all neurites in the image,) were calculated to pilot for quality assessment of assay conditions. Despite relatively poor z′ (−0.84 for ANL where z′ = 1 − (3 × SDuntreated + 3 × SDAβ)/(Averageuntreated − AverageAβ)) due to the variance typical for primary neurons treated with Aβ1–40, this method consistently yielded significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences between Aβ1–40 treated and untreated control groups. NINDS custom collection compound library II containing 1,040 known bioactive small molecule compounds was used in the primary screen. The details of this library can be viewed on the ICCB-Longwood, the Harvard Medical School webpage. The compounds were robotically added to neurons at a concentration of 25 μm with all compound plates screened in triplicate. Each plate included untreated and Aβ1–40-treated control wells. Only plates with significant difference (at least p ≤ 0.1, usually p ≤ 0.05 using 2-tailed Student's t test) between control groups were used for hit selection. z-scores were calculated based on degree of protection as compared with Aβ1–40 treated control where z = (compound well score − AverageAβ control)/SDAβ control). The following criteria were used for hit selection: 1) average and median z for each hit compound ≥1.5 (p ≤ 0.05), 2) average z for each hit ≥ z-score difference between untreated and Aβ1–40 controls for that specific plate, and 3) visual inspection of hit compound wells confirmed high image quality. This resulted in a total of 42 primary hits (4%). These were re-examined in a secondary screen, under the same conditions, except the compounds were used at 5 concentrations (2.5 nm, 25 nm, 250 nm, and 2.5 μm) to generate an estimated EC50 as described below. Multiple resources (NCBI, Wishart) were used to get drug target information for the analysis. To assess the enrichment of hit compound categories relative to their representation in the NINDS library, p values were computed using hypergeometric probability distribution. Categories with p < 0.05 were considered enriched. This analysis allowed us to identify functional categories of inhibitors enriched in screening hits and to evaluate the putative roles of these classes of inhibitors in AD. For EC50 calculations, neurons were treated with Aβ as above in the presence of either 4 (2.5 nm, 25 nm, 250 nm, and 2.5 μm) or 9 (0.1 nm, 1.0 nm, 10 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, 500 nm, 1.0 μm, 5 μm, 50 μm, and 100 μm) concentrations compound as described in the text. EC50 values were calculated by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. For “EC50 (μm) (from 0 to 100%)” column, values represent the concentrations of compound that provide 50% neurite protection relative to the untreated control, which was set as 100%. In “EC50 (μm) (from min to max)” column values represent concentrations of compounds providing half protection between the lowest and highest points of each compound curve. N/A indicates lack of fit. Drugs for secondary screening, NSAID specific compounds and PPARγ targeting compounds were purchased form Cayman Chemical or Sigma. After treatment, cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitors) and equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis using COX2, PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and tubulin (Sigma) antibodies. The binding assay was performed according to the manufacturers instructions (Cayman Chemical). Briefly, a specific double-stranded DNA sequence containing the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) is immobilized onto a 96-well plate. PPARs contained in a neuronal nuclear extract were bound to the PPRE and PPARγ was selectively detected using a specific antibody. A secondary antibody conjugated to HRP was added to provide a colorimetric readout at 450 nm. Absorbance values were determined using Victor Wallac3 platereader (Perkin Elmer). Concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Absorbance values were normalized to nuclear extract concentrations and presented as percentages of the untreated control cells. Experiments were performed in triplicate. To identify small molecules that can suppress Aβ1–40 induced degeneration of neuronal processes, we screened the 1,040 compound known bioactives NINDS custom collection library II, in primary mouse cortical neurons in the presence of oligomeric Aβ1–40 (5 μm). Neurite lengths were quantified using the NeuriteIQ software (Fig. 1A, see “Materials and Methods” for the detailed description), in which individual neurons were identified and the average neurite length was determined (Fig. 1B). The NeuriteIQ algorithm can accurately calculate a reduction of neurite length in response to Αβ1–40 peptide treatment (8.Zhang Y. Zhou X. Degterev A. Lipinski M. Adjeroh D. Yuan J. Wong S.T. A novel tracing algorithm for high throughput imaging. Screening of neuron-based assays.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 160: 149-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). To minimize false positives, hits were selected using a high threshold (× + 1.5 S.D.) over ANL values for Aβ-treated control wells in each plate (Fig. 1D). In our primary screen, 42 compounds (∼0.4%) were identified based on significant (p ≤ 0.05) protection against Αβ1–40-induced neurite loss (Fig. 2A). To confirm the specificity of the hits, the compounds were re-examined in a secondary screen and the half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were estimated. The secondary screen confirmed 36 (85%) compounds (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2) that significantly (z ≥ 2.15, p ≤ 0.01) protected primary cortical neurons from Aβ1–40 induced-neurite degeneration at micromolar or lower concentrations. Functional clustering of the compound hits identified several drug categories that were enriched when compared with their representation in the NINDS library (Fig. 2B). Notably, NSAIDs, anti-histamines and alkylating/DNA-damaging agents were highly enriched among the hits. We believe compounds that showed statistical significance in both the primary and secondary screens are real hits, however, because the drug category did not show significant enrichment as compared with their representation in the library we did not focus on these classes of inhibitors in molecules. These molecules have a broad spectrum of targets, and these will need to be further examined in the future work. These results were promising since all three categories of molecules have been previously investigated as anti-Aβ drugs. The NSAID category was of particular interest because several of our hits have received controversial attention as potential Alzheimer therapeutics including naproxol, aspirin, and ibuprofen (11.Cole G.M. Frautschy S.A. Mechanisms of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of Alzheimer disease.CNS Neurological Disorders Drug Targets. 2010; 9: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, metacetamol, meloxicam, and nabumetone were among the validated hits in our screen with their activity confirmed in secondary assay (Figs. 2A and 3A). While particular NSAIDs might have targets other than cyclooxygenases (COX), the abundance of NSAID hits suggests that COX-1/2 activity may mediate Aβ1–40 induced neurite loss. To explore this question, we titrated both ibuprofen and nabumetone in the Aβ1–40 induced-neurite loss assay. Ibuprofen and nabumetone protected neurite loss with EC50 values of 0.035 and 0.147 μm, respectively (Fig. 3B). The NSAID compounds identified in the screen are capable of inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 according to their published activities against recombinant and cellular COX proteins. Thus, to confirm the role of COX enzymes and determine if one of the isoenzymes is necessary for the protective effects of the identified NSAIDs, we utilized a battery of additional COX-1/2 inhibitors (12.Dargahi L. Nasiraei-Moghadam S. Abdi A. Khalaj L. Moradi F. Ahmadiani A. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 activity precedes the COX-2 induction in Aβ-induced neuroinflammation.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2011; 45: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Notably, multiple additional inhibitors displayed some degree of neurite protection (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, both COX-1 and COX-2-specific inhibitors worked in our Aβ1–40 assay system. Taken together these results suggest that both COX-1 and COX-2 are needed for Aβ-induced neurite loss. Finally, we tested several of the hits in the absence of the Aβ peptide, including ibuprofen and meloxicam, and found no effect on neurite lengths at concentrations, which provide protection from Aβ (Fig. 3E and supplemental Fig. S3). Therefore, these molecules may specifically interfere with Aβ peptide-induced neurite loss, rather than promoting neurite outgrowth. While Aβ1–40 is the present in the brain at much higher levels (13.Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. The C-terminus of the beta protein is critical in amyloidogenesis.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 695: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), Aβ1–42 may be a more toxic APP derived peptide. We therefore tested the ability of several NSAIDs to inhibit Aβ1–42 dependent neurite loss. Similarly to the shorter Aβ1–40, two concentrations of Aβ1–42 elicited a significant loss of neurites which was markedly attenuated by ibuprofen, naproxen, and nabumetone (supplemental Fig. S4). Recent evidence suggests that ibuprofen can promote neurite growth through a PPARγ-mediated pathway (14.Dill J. Patel A.R. Yang X.L. Bachoo R. Powell C.M. Li S. A molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated RhoA inhibition in neurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NSAIDs elicited neurite outgrowth at high concentrations (e.g. >100 μm ibuprofen, Fig. 3E), while our data points to Aβ-specific activity of multiple NSAIDs at low micromolar concentrations. However, a reported connection between ibuprofen and PPARγ prompted us to further examine the possible role of PPARγ in the Aβ-specific activity of NSAIDs. Indeed, Aβ-induced neurite loss was completely reversed in the presence of the selective PPARγ agonist 5-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (10 μm) suggesting that PPARγ activity alone is sufficient to rescue neurite loss. Furthermore, while 10 μm ibuprofen effectively inhibited Aβ-induced neurite loss, this effect was eliminated in the presence of PPARγ antagonist, GW 9662 (1 μm, Fig. 4A). As PPARγ is a transcription factor, we next investigated the possibility that Aβ treatment inhibits its nuclear activity. Aβ caused a marked reduction of PPARγ DNA binding activity (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, not only ibuprofen, as previously reported (14.Dill J. Patel A.R. Yang X.L. Bachoo R. Powell C.M. Li S. A molecular mechanism for ibuprofen-mediated RhoA inhibition in neurons.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but also nabumetone and naproxen rescued PPARγ activity in Aβ-treated samples (Fig. 4B) at concentrations that prevent Aβ-induced neurite loss. NSAIDs predominantly affected PPARγ DNA binding in Aβ-treated neurons, but had minimal effect on control cells, consistent with the specific roles of COX and PPARγ in Aβ-induced signaling leading to neurite loss. In addition, we determined that COX-2 protein levels were increased in Aβ-treated neurons (Fig. 4, C and D); ibuprofen did not attenuate Aβ-induced COX-2 increase. The increase in COX-2 protein levels following Aβ treatment did not alter PPARγ protein expression. Taken together these data suggest a model in which COX activity and/or expression is elevated in neurons following Aβ treatment leading to inhibition of PPARγ signaling and contributing to neurite loss. Thus, NSAIDs reduce COX activity and promote PPARγ-dependent neurite protection/recovery. The loss of synaptic connections and neuronal projections is a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson and Alzheimer. Neurite degeneration precedes cell death, suggesting that neurite loss might be a primary cause of cognitive function decline (15.Selkoe D.J. Deciphering the genesis and fate of amyloid beta-protein yields novel therapies for Alzheimer disease.J. Clinic. Investig. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Recent reclassification of AD suggests that pathophysiology begins many years before the diagnosis of AD dementia (16.Sperling R.A. Aisen P.S. Beckett L.A. Bennett D.A. Craft S. Fagan A.M. Iwatsubo T. Jack C.R. Kaye J. Montine T.J. Park D.C. Reiman E.M. Rowe C.C. Siemers E. Stern Y. Yaffe K. Carrillo M.C. Thies B. Morrison-Bogorad M. Wagster M.V. Phelps C.H. Alzheimers Dement. 2011; 7: 280-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4646) Google Scholar). Therefore, chemical compounds attenuating neurite loss or promoting neurite outgrowth could represent promising new treatments in AD. HCS using primary neurons is hampered by intrinsic difficulties, such as variability in cell density throughout the well and well-to-well, the need to distinguish between the neuronal and non-neuronal cells present in the cultures, the need for extended culturing of neurons for neurite development, and difficulties in accurately quantifying neurite lengths in complex dense neuronal cultures. The NeuriteIQ pipeline introduces a number of elements to address these difficulties, such as: (a) imaging large well areas at 10× magnification to reduce the effects of differences in intrawell densities, (b) use of neuron-specific neurite labeling, (c) nuclear staining, which provides means to normalize neurite lengths to cell numbers and to exclude positively labeled debris not connected to nuclei, and (d) filtering nuclei not connected to neurites, which eliminates non-neuronal cells. These NeuriteIQ features in conjunction with statistical analysis of hits relative to the positive and negative controls in each plate and screening the library in triplicate resulted in a highly reliable hit selection. 36 of 42 screening hits displayed activity in our secondary assay. Overall, these data suggest that the NeuriteIQ screening procedure provides a reliable tool for discovery of novel neurite-protective molecules and putative AD drug candidates. Furthermore, NeuriteIQ can be easily ex"

In this study, the association between post-transplant graft function and the perioperative activity of platelet antioxidants was examined among kidney recipients divided into early (EGF), slow (SGF), and delayed graft function (DGF) groups. Methodology/Principal Findings Activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P) were determined and levels of glutathione, oxidized glutathione, and isoprostane were measured in blood samples collected immediately before and during the first and fifth minutes of renal allograft reperfusion. Our results demonstrated a significant increase in isoprostane levels in all groups. Interestingly, in DGF patients, significantly lower levels of perioperative activity of catalase (p<0.02) and GST (p<0.02) were observed. Moreover, in our study, the activity of platelet antioxidants was associated with intensity of perioperative oxidative stress. For discriminating SGF/DGF from EGF, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of platelet antioxidants were 81–91%, 50–58%, 32–37%, and 90–90.5%, respectively. Conclusions During renal transplantation, significant changes occur in the activity of platelet antioxidants. These changes seem to be associated with post-transplant graft function and can be potentially used to differentiate between EGF and SGF/DGF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the potential protective role of platelets in the human transplantation setting."
https://openalex.org/W2035215975,"The framework for playing quantum games in an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type setting is investigated using the mathematical formalism of geometric algebra (GA). The main advantage of this framework is that the players' strategy sets remain identical to the ones in the classical mixed-strategy version of the game, and hence the quantum game becomes a proper extension of the classical game, avoiding a criticism of other quantum game frameworks. We produce a general solution for two-player games, and as examples, we analyze the games of Prisoners' Dilemma and Stag Hunt in the EPR setting. The use of GA allows a quantum-mechanical analysis without the use of complex numbers or the Dirac Bra-ket notation, and hence is more accessible to the non-physicist."

AD is characterized with the pathological accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) in the brain. Aβ peptides are the normal proteolytic products of amyloid-β precursor protein (1.Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Aβ oligomers, a decade of discovery.J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Depending on the exact proteolytic cleavage site of amyloid-β precursor protein, different lengths of Aβ products containing 38 to 43 residues can be derived. The 40-residue Aβ40 and 42-residue Aβ42 are the two major Aβ species. Aβ42 is the predominant form found in amyloid plaques (2.Younkin S.G.

Small molecules that stabilize Aβ monomer would effectively prevent any further aggregation. Therefore, characterization of Aβ monomer structure is crucial for both understanding the mechanism of Aβ aggregation and developing novel therapeutic interventions at the earliest point of Aβ aggregation.

In a combined NMR and molecular dynamics study, Sgourakis et al. (18.Sgourakis N.G. Yan Y. McCallum S.A. Wang C. Garcia A.E.

Recently, Vivekanandan et al. (19.Vivekanandan S. Brender J.R. Lee S.Y. Ramamoorthy A. A partially folded structure of amyloid-β (1–40) in an aqueous environment.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 411: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) used NMR to show that the segment 13–23 adopts a 310 helix structure in Aβ40. Despite extensive investigations, Aβ monomer structure still remains speculative. Many conformations of Aβ monomers containing different fractions of secondary structural elements have been suggested, but little consensus was found in these studies. One potential factor contributing to the discrepancies in previous work is sample homogeneity. It has been shown that Aβ forms small oligomers almost instantly upon dissolving in aqueous solution (20.Bitan G. Kirkitadze M.D. Lomakin A. Vollers S.S. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) assembly: Aβ40 and Aβ42 oligomerize through distinct pathways.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very difficult to obtain a homogeneous solution of Aβ monomers. To address the homogeneity issue, here we employ a solid-support approach to study the structure of Aβ40 monomers. In the solid-support approach, Aβ monomers are tethered on nickel-charged agarose beads via a 6-residue His tag introduced at the N terminus of Aβ sequence. The non-covalent interaction between nickel and His tag is strong enough to withstand denaturing conditions, allowing tethering to take place under conditions unfavorable for Aβ aggregation, such as 8 m urea in a buffer of pH 11 in this work. Both high concentration of urea (21.Pallitto M.M. Murphy R.M. A mathematical model of the kinetics of β-amyloid fibril growth from the denatured state.Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1805-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and high pH (22.Teplow D.B. Preparation of amyloid β-protein for structural and functional studies.Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) are known to inhibit Aβ aggregation. Because Aβ monomers are tethered on the solid support, interactions among monomers for further aggregation are prevented. Thus, a homogeneous sample of Aβ monomers can be obtained. Previous studies have shown that tethering generally does not perturb protein structure. For example, Amirgoulova et al. (23.Amirgoulova E.V. Groll J. Heyes C.D. Ameringer T. Röcker C. Möller M. Nienhaus G.U. Biofunctionalized polymer surfaces exhibiting minimal interaction towards immobilized proteins.ChemPhysChem. 2004; 5: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) developed a cross-linked, six-arm, star-shaped polyethylene glycol surface, which was shown to allow reversible unfolding and refolding, and also has negligible interaction with the immobilized proteins. Zhuang et al. (24.Zhuang X. Bartley L.E. Babcock H.P. Russell R. Ha T. Herschlag D. Chu S. A single-molecule study of RNA catalysis and folding.Science. 2000; 288: 2048-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) developed a modified ribozyme which was immobilized to a surface via a streptavidin-biotin interaction. It shows that immobilized protein resulted in identical rate and equilibrium constants of catalytic reaction as obtained from unmodified protein, indicating that immobilized ribozyme was functionally indistinguishable from the unmodified free ribozyme in solution. Previously, EPR studies of T4 lysozyme (T4L) labeled at various sites show that the EPR spectral lineshape remains largely unchanged upon tethering on solid support (25.Guo, Z., (2003) Correlation of spin label side-chain Dynamics with protein structure: studies of T4 lysozyme with site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography.

Upon tethering on solid support, we use EPR spectroscopy to study the structure of Aβ monomers. EPR has been proven to be a powerful technique in studying protein structure, dynamics, and protein-protein interactions (27.Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. A new spin on protein dynamics.Trends Biochem.

Because EPR signal originates from the magnetic resonance of spin labels introduced at specific residues in protein sequence, use of solid support does not affect EPR analysis. Rather, tethering on solid support has the advantage of reducing the overall tumbling of the whole protein, allowing EPR analysis to be focused on intrinsic protein dynamics. Spin labels are introduced to protein sequence through site-directed spin labeling. The basic strategy of site-directed spin labeling is to first substitute a specific residue with a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis. Then the SH group of the cysteine residue is reacted with a spin labeling reagent to generate a spin-labeled side chain. The spin-labeled side chain used in this work is named R1 (supplemental Fig. S1). Three major pieces of information can be obtained from EPR studies of spin-labeled proteins: spin label mobility, solvent accessibility, and inter-residue distance. In this work, we use spin label mobility to analyze the structure of Aβ monomers. Cysteine was introduced into T4L sequence at residue 72 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). For protein expression, the mutant construct was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). The cells were cultured to an absorbance of A600 nm ≈0.6 in LB broth at 37 °C and then induced with 1 mm IPTG at 28 °C for 4–6 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation. For purification of T4L protein, the cells were resuspended in PS buffer (50 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and then sonicated on ice. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered using 0.45-μm filter (Whatman) and loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PS buffer. Protein was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (50 to 500 mm) in 10 column volumes. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 24.1 mm−1 cm−1. For spin labeling, T4L was first incubated in 10 mm DTT for 20 min to break any disulfide bonds and then desalted using a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. The spin labeling reagent MTSSL (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate; Enzo Life Sciences) was used at 5-times molar excess and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Free spin labels were removed by a 5-ml HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PS buffer. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed to ensure that the mass is correct and the extent of labeling is >95%. For denaturation of untethered T4L, T4L D72R1 was diluted to 0–5 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) with a stock solution containing 15 mm phosphate, 7 m GdnHCl, and pH 6.8 for EPR spectroscopy. For denaturation of tethered T4L, T4L D72R1 was added to 100 μl of agarose beads charged with nickel (Agarose Bead Technologies) and the mixture was incubated at room temperature on a nutating mixer for 1 h to allow attachment of peptides onto the beads. The beads were then washed six times with 500 μl of buffer containing 15 mm phosphate, pH 6.8, with 0–5 m GdnHCl for EPR spectroscopy. The unfolding data were analyzed with nonlinear least-squares fitting as described in Santoro and Bolen (34.Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Unfolding free energy changes determined by the linear extrapolation method. 1. Unfolding of phenylmethanesulfonyl α-chymotrypsin using different denaturants.Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) to obtain Cm, the concentration of GdnHCl at the mid-point of unfolding transition. The DNA constructs of GroES-ubiquitin-Aβ40 construct and the deubiquitylating enzyme Usp2cc were kindly provided by Dr. Il-Seon Park at Chosun University (South Korea) and Dr. Rohan T Baker at Australian National University (Australia). DNA sequence containing codons for amino acids HHHHHHGG was introduced into the N terminus of Aβ40 sequence using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Two Gly residues were intentionally inserted between the His tag and Aβ sequence to allow Aβ to move freely after tethering on beads. Single cysteine mutations at various sites were then introduced into the Aβ40 sequence using QuikChange kit. Mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. For protein expression, the plasmid constructs of Aβ40 fusion protein and Usp2cc were transformed into C41(DE3) cells (Lucigen). The cells were cultured to an absorbance of A600 nm ≈0.6 in LB broth at 37 °C and then induced with 1 mm IPTG at 28 °C for 4–6 h. Aβ fusion protein was purified using a nickel column as previously described (35.Ngo S. Guo Z. Key residues for the oligomerization of Aβ42 protein in Alzheimer disease.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2011; 414: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For purification of Usp2cc, the cells were resuspended in TG buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm β-mecaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, pH 7.5) and then sonicated on ice. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was filtered through 0.45-μm filter (Whatman) and loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap SP HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with TG buffer. The protein was eluted using a step gradient of 50 and 100 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 3.84 and 40.84 mm−1 cm−1 for Aβ fusion protein and Usp2cc, respectively. Full-length Aβ protein was cleaved from the fusion protein with Usp2cc by mixing 2 ml of Aβ fusion protein with 1.95 ml of distilled water, 50 μl of purified Usp2cc at ∼200 μm concentration, and 8 μl of 1 m TCEP stock (in 100 mm CAPS, pH 11). Therefore, the Usp2cc digestion was always performed in a buffer containing 25 mm phosphate, 3 m urea, 2 mm TCEP, pH 10. The digestion reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was then immediately filtered with 0.2-μm filter (Whatman) and loaded on a PRP-3 reverse phase column (Hamilton) equilibrated with 30 mm ammonium acetate, pH 10. Aβ40 protein was eluted using acetonitrile in a linear gradient over 10 column volumes. Purified Aβ was lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. The mass of purified Aβ40 was checked with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and no other impurities were detected on mass spectrum. For spin labeling, powders of single-cysteine mutated Aβ40 were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 8 m urea, pH 7.4 and the spin labeling reagent MTSSL was used at 10-times molar excess. The spin-labeled Aβ40 was further purified by reverse phase HPLC as described above. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed to ensure that the mass is correct, and the extent of labeling is >95%. Spin-labeled Aβ proteins were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. Lyophilized spin-labeled Aβ40 mutant powder was first dissolved in 400 μl of 20 mm CAPS buffer, 8 m urea, pH 11 to a concentration of 25 μm. It was shown previously Aβ40 was rendered monomeric and denatured in 8 m urea, pH 10 (21.Pallitto M.M. Murphy R.M. A mathematical model of the kinetics of β-amyloid fibril growth from the denatured state.Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1805-1822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The solution was added to 100 μl of agarose beads slurry charged with nickel (Agarose Bead Technologies), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature on a nutating mixer for 1 h to allow attachment of peptides onto the beads. The beads were then washed six times with either 500 μl of PG buffer (15 mm sodium phosphate, 7 m GdnHCl, pH 7.4) or PBS buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to remove unattached peptides. EPR measurements were performed at X-band frequency on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with the ER 4102ST cavity. A modulation frequency of 100 kHz was used. Measurements were performed at 20 milliwatt microwave power at room temperature. Modulation amplitude was optimized to 1 G. For each sample, ∼20 μl of solution sample or beads slurry was loaded into glass capillaries (VitroCom) sealed at one end. EPR spectra in each figure panel were normalized to the same number of spins. Spectral simulations were performed using a LabVIEW (National Instruments) interface (36.McCoy J. Hubbell W.L.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) of the program NLSL developed by Freed and co-workers (37.Schneider D.J. Freed J.H. Berliner L.J. Reuben J.

Reson., Ser A. 1996; 120: 155-189Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). A microscopic order macroscopic disorder model was used as previously described (38.Budil D.E. Lee S. Saxena S. Freed J.H. J. Magn. Reson., Ser A. 1996; 120: 155-189Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). A least-squares fit of the user-defined spectral parameters was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. For all fits, the values for the magnetic tensors A and g were fixed as Axx = 5.7, Ayy = 6.0, Azz = 37.5, and gxx = 2.0078, gyy = 2.0058, gzz = 2.0023, which were determined previously for R1 (39.Columbus L. Kálai T. Jekö J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Molecular motion of spin-labeled side chains in α-helices: analysis by variation of side chain structure.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3828-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Two parameters were allowed to vary: isotropic rotational diffusion constant (R), and A0 (average of Axx, Ayy, and Azz). Here A0 is used as a variable parameter to account for the effect of solvent polarity on A0, but varying A0 does not affect R. Rotational correlation time (τ) was calculated from τ = 1/(6R). One and two component fits were performed as indicated in the text. Values of τ obtained from simulation are plotted in the figures. The general strategy of solid-support EPR is to tether a protein on agarose beads. Agarose is a cross-linked form of polysaccharide polymer, and is the most widely used solid support matrix for affinity chromatography (40.Wilchek M. Miron T. React. Funct. Polym. 1999; 41: 263-268Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Agarose has many properties of an ideal solid support including low nonspecific binding, hydrophilic characteristic, and chemical stability under conditions of coupling as well as under various conditions of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and presence of denaturants. We choose to use the non-covalent interaction between nickel and His tag for the following reasons. (i) His tag allows tethering at either N- or C-terminal end. Tethering at the end of a protein generally does not affect protein structure. (ii) His tag is small, containing six His residues in this work, and it normally does not interact with other parts of the protein (41.Carson M. Johnson D.H. McDonald H. Brouillette C. Delucas L.J. His tag impact on structure.Acta Crystallogr. D. 2007; 63: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). (iii) Binding between nickel and His tag is reversible, allowing the protein to be released from agarose beads if needed. Fig. 1A shows a schematic drawing of a protein tethered on agarose beads. Previous studies have shown that tethering on solid supports in general does not disrupt protein structure (23.Amirgoulova E.V. Groll J. Heyes C.D. Ameringer T. Röcker C. Möller M. Nienhaus G.U.

https://openalex.org/W1999176127,"Regulation of viral transcription by chromatin structure has emerged as a fundamental determinant in the establishment of lytic and latent herpesvirus infections. The Polycomb group (PcG) of epigenetic repressors promotes heterochromatin formation by trimethylating histone H3 on lysine-27 (H3K27me3) and regulates development, stem cell renewal and differentiation and the cell cycle. These cellular processes are tightly coupled to the molecular switch between lytic and latent herpesvirus infections. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we observed enrichment of H3K27me3 at the major immediate-early (MIE) locus of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) very early following infection of permissive fibroblasts. As lytic replication progressed, we observed a loss of H3K27me3 enrichment concomitant with the appearance of H3K4me3. However, late during infection, as viral replication centers are established, we observed a significant increase in PcG protein association with chromatin. Additionally, in co-immunofluorescence assays using confocal microscopy, we detected strong enrichments for PcG protein within the viral replication compartment, suggesting an association between viral DNA synthesis machinery and PcG proteins. Together, our results suggest a novel, dynamic interaction between PcG epigenetic repressors and MCMV genomes."

We developed a lentivirus-based RNAi library consisting of 26-nt short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). The library was generated enzymatically from a large collection of expressed sequence tag (EST) DNAs corresponding to ~20,000 human genes and contains on average ~6 highly potent shRNAs (>75% knockdown efficiency) for each gene. Using this novel shRNA library, together with a robust cell model for β2AR expression, we performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting and isolated cells that, as a consequence of shRNA-mediated gene inactivation, exhibited defective agonist-induced down-regulation. The screen discovered several previously unrecognized β2AR regulators, including farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS). We showed that inactivation of FDPS by shRNA, small interfering RNA, or the highly specific pharmaceutical inhibitor alendronate inhibited β2AR down-regulation. Notably, in human airway smooth muscle cells, the physiological target of β-agonists, alendronate treatment functionally reversed agonist-induced endogenous β2AR loss as indicated by an increase in cAMP production. FDPS inactivation interfered with β2AR internalization into endosomes through disrupting the membrane localization of the Rab5 small GTPase. Furthermore, Rab5 overexpression reversed the deficient receptor down-regulation induced by alendronate, suggesting that FDPS regulates receptor down-regulation in a Rab5-dependent manner. Together, our findings reveal a FDPS-dependent mechanism in the internalization and down-regulation of β2AR, identify FDPS as a potential target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of β-agonists, and demonstrate the utility of the unique EST-derived shRNA library for functional genetics studies.—Jiang, X., Pan, H., Nabhan, J.

PBCV-1 has another gene a654l that encodes a protein with sequence similarity to the GCN5 family histone acetyltransferases. In this study, we report a 1.5 Å crystal structure of PBCV-1 A654L in a complex with coenzyme A. The structure reveals a unique feature of A654L that precludes its acetylation of histone peptide substrates. We demonstrate that A654L, hence named viral polyamine acetyltransferase (vPAT), acetylates polyamines such as putrescine, spermidine, cadaverine, and homospermidine present in both PBCV-1 and its host through a reaction dependent upon a conserved glutamate 27. Our study suggests that as the first virally encoded polyamine acetyltransferase, vPAT plays a possible key role in the regulation of polyamine catabolism in the host during viral replication.

https://openalex.org/W2059380507,"Tissue-specific stem cells are considered to have a limited differentiation potential. Recently, this notion was challenged by reports that showed a broader differentiation potential of neural stem cells, in vitro and in vivo, although the molecular mechanisms that regulate plasticity of neural stem cells are unknown. Here, we report that neural stem cells derived from mouse embryonic cortex respond to Lif and serum in vitro and undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated dedifferentiation process within 48 h, together with transient upregulation of pluripotency markers and, more notably, upregulation of mesendoderm genes, Brachyury (T) and Sox17. These induced putative mesendoderm cells were injected into early gastrulating chick embryos, which revealed that they integrated more efficiently into mesoderm and endoderm lineages compared to non-induced cells. We also found that TGFβ and Jak/Stat pathways are necessary but not sufficient for the induction of mesendodermal phenotype in neural stem cells. These results provide insights into the regulation of plasticity of neural stem cells through EMT. Dissecting the regulatory pathways involved in these processes may help to gain control over cell fate decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2043542969,"OTUB1 is a member of OTUs (Ovarian-tumor-domain-containing proteases), a deubiquitinating enzymes family (DUBs), which was shown as a proteasome-associated DUB to be involved in the proteins Ub-dependent degradation. It has been reported that OTUB1 was expressed in kidney tissue. But its concrete cellular location and function in the kidney remain unclear. Decorin (DCN) in mesangial cells (MC) is considered to be a potentially important factor for antagonizing glomerulonephritides, and its degradation is mediated by ubiquitination. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of OTUB1 expression in MC and its relationship with DCN during glomerulonephritis.Using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, we demonstrated that OTUB1 mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed in cultured rat MC and found to be upregulated by the stimulation of IL-1β or ATS. OTUB1 overexpression was detected in the mesangial area of glomeruli in some immunocomplex mediated nephritides such as IgA nephropathy, acute diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis by immunohistochemistry. The immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that OTUB1 interacted with DCN. The overexpression of OTUB1 enhanced the ubiquitination and degradation of DCN in MC.These data showed the inflammatory injury could up-regulate OTUB1 expression in MC, which might attribute the promoting effect of OTUB1 on glomerulonephritides to the decrease of DCN level."
