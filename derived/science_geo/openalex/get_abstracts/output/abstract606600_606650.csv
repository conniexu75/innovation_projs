https://openalex.org/W2789267419,"Behavior is driven by coordinated activity across a population of neurons. Learning requires the brain to change the neural population activity produced to achieve a given behavioral goal. How does population activity reorganize during learning? We studied intracortical population activity in the primary motor cortex of rhesus macaques during short-term learning in a brain-computer interface (BCI) task. In a BCI, the mapping between neural activity and behavior is exactly known, enabling us to rigorously define hypotheses about neural reorganization during learning. We found that changes in population activity followed a suboptimal neural strategy of reassociation: animals relied on a fixed repertoire of activity patterns and associated those patterns with different movements after learning. These results indicate that the activity patterns that a neural population can generate are even more constrained than previously thought and might explain why it is often difficult to quickly learn to a high level of proficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2790053528,"Haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene is causally linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and ASD-associated genes are also enriched for chromatin remodelers. Here we found that brief treatment with romidepsin, a highly potent class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, alleviated social deficits in Shank3-deficient mice, which persisted for ~3 weeks. HDAC2 transcription was upregulated in these mice, and knockdown of HDAC2 in prefrontal cortex also rescued their social deficits. Nuclear localization of β-catenin, a Shank3-binding protein that regulates cell adhesion and transcription, was increased in Shank3-deficient mice, which induced HDAC2 upregulation and social deficits. At the downstream molecular level, romidepsin treatment elevated the expression and histone acetylation of Grin2a and actin-regulatory genes and restored NMDA-receptor function and actin filaments in Shank3-deficient mice. Taken together, these findings highlight an epigenetic mechanism underlying social deficits linked to Shank3 deficiency, which may suggest potential therapeutic strategies for ASD patients bearing SHANK3 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2793524180,"Changing one’s mind on the basis of new evidence is a hallmark of cognitive flexibility. To revise our confidence in a previous decision, we should use new evidence to update beliefs about choice accuracy. How this process unfolds in the human brain, however, remains unknown. Here we manipulated whether additional sensory evidence supports or negates a previous motion direction discrimination judgment while recording markers of neural activity in the human brain using fMRI. A signature of post-decision evidence (change in log-odds correct) was selectively observed in the activity of posterior medial frontal cortex. In contrast, distinct activity profiles in anterior prefrontal cortex mediated the impact of post-decision evidence on subjective confidence, independently of changes in decision value. Together our findings reveal candidate neural mediators of post-decisional changes of mind in the human brain and indicate possible targets for ameliorating deficits in cognitive flexibility. Changing one’s mind requires revising previous decisions in light of new evidence. The authors combine a psychophysical manipulation of post-decision evidence with fMRI to isolate neural mediators of changes of mind in human prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2789346431,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has a reported greater prevalence and poorer treatment outcomes in people living with HIV (PLWH) than comparable HIV-uninfected cohorts. We conducted a cross-sectional study to delineate the factors driving T2D in PLWH in an ethnically diverse cohort, and additionally observed how these have changed over time.We studied a diverse HIV cohort in London to determine the prevalence and risk factors for T2D, and compared them to a cohort studied 10 years previously.Patients were classified as normoglycaemic (fasting glucose <6.0 mmol/l) or dysglycaemic (≥6.0 mmol/l). The relative contribution to dysglycaemia of modifiable and fixed factors, including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, immune status, and HIV therapy, were analysed using univariate and logistic regression analyses.T2D prevalence was 15.1% in 2015 with a relative risk of 2.4 compared to the general population. The prevalence compared to 6.8% ten years earlier. The 2015 versus the 2005 cohort was significantly older (median age 49 (42-57) years versus 41 (IQR 35-47), p<0.001), had a higher BMI (27.4 (23.3-29.9) versus 24.9 (22.4-28.0) kg/m2 respectively, p = 0.019) and hypertensive (37.9% versus 19.6 respectively, p<0.001). The strongest predictors of dysglycaemia in the 2015 cohort were hepatic steatosis and hypertension, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.74 (3.48-13.03) and 2.92 (1.66-5.16) respectively, and also HIV-related factors of weight gain following antiretroviral initiation and longer known duration of HIV infection (OR 1.07 (1.04-1.11) and 1.06 (1.02-1.10) respectively).The alarmingly high prevalence of T2D in HIV requires improved screening, targeted to older patients and those with a longer duration of exposure to antiretrovirals. Effective diabetes prevention and management strategies are needed urgently to reduce this risk; such interventions should target both conventional risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, and HIV-specific risk factors such as weight gain following initiation of antiretrovirals."

https://openalex.org/W2790085433,"Massive galaxies are thought to form in two phases: an initial collapse of gas and giant burst of central star formation, followed by the later accretion of material that builds up their stellar and dark-matter haloes. The systems of globular clusters within such galaxies are believed to form in a similar manner. The initial central burst forms metal-rich (spectrally red) clusters, whereas more metal-poor (spectrally blue) clusters are brought in by the later accretion of less-massive satellites. This formation process is thought to result in the multimodal optical colour distributions that are seen in the globular cluster systems of massive galaxies. Here we report optical observations of the massive relic-galaxy candidate NGC 1277-a nearby, un-evolved example of a high-redshift 'red nugget' galaxy. We find that the optical colour distribution of the cluster system of NGC 1277 is unimodal and entirely red. This finding is in strong contrast to other galaxies of similar and larger stellar mass, the cluster systems of which always exhibit (and are generally dominated by) blue clusters. We argue that the colour distribution of the cluster system of NGC 1277 indicates that the galaxy has undergone little (if any) mass accretion after its initial collapse, and use simulations of possible merger histories to show that the stellar mass due to accretion is probably at most ten per cent of the total stellar mass of the galaxy. These results confirm that NGC 1277 is a genuine relic galaxy and demonstrate that blue clusters constitute an accreted population in present-day massive galaxies."

However, the enzyme(s) responsible for the cleavage of the vinyl ether linkage in plasmalogens has remained elusive. Herein, we report that cytochrome c, in the presence of either cardiolipin (CL), O2 and H2O2, or oxidized CL and O2, catalyzes the oxidation of the plasmalogen vinyl ether linkage, promoting its hydrolytic cleavage and resultant production of 2-AA-lysolipids and highly reactive α-hydroxy fatty aldehydes. Using stable isotope labeling in synergy with strategic chemical derivatizations and high-mass-accuracy MS, we deduced the chemical mechanism underlying this long sought-after reaction. Specifically, labeling with either 18O2 or H218O, but not with H218O2, resulted in M + 2 isotopologues of the α-hydroxyaldehyde, whereas reactions with both 18O2 and H218O identified the M + 4 isotopologue. Furthermore, incorporation of 18O from 18O2 was predominantly located at the α-carbon. In contrast, reactions with H218O yielded 18O linked to the aldehyde carbon. Importantly, no significant labeling of 2-AA-lysolipids with 18O2, H218O, or H218O2 was present. Intriguingly, phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIP2 and PIP3) effectively substituted for cardiolipin.

Based upon the known chemical sensitivity of the plasmalogen vinyl ether linkage to oxidation (37Scherrer L.A. Gross R.W. Subcellular distribution, molecular dynamics and catabolism of plasmalogens in myocardium.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 88 (2674669): 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the peroxidase activity of cardiolipin-activated cytochrome c could oxidatively metabolize the vinyl ether bond in plasmalogens, leading to an intermediate that was susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. Herein, we report that CL-activated cyt c catalyzes the oxidatively enabled hydrolytic cleavage of the vinyl ether linkage of plasmenylcholine and plasmenylethanolamine in the presence of H2O2 or alternatively by oxidized CL. The products of the reaction, 2-acyl-lysophospholipids and α-hydroxy fatty aldehydes, were identified either directly by high-resolution accurate-mass (HRAM) MS and fragmentation analyses or through synergistic chemical derivatization strategies and HRAM MS of derivatized precursor ions and their fragmentation-induced product ions. Importantly, we demonstrate that oxidized CL can activate the plasmalogenase activity of cyt c even in the absence of H2O2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification of a protein that can catalyze the cleavage of the vinyl ether linkage of plasmalogens, thereby identifying multiple previously unknown cellular lipid metabolic pathways that participate in cellular metabolism, signaling, and cell fate decisions. Because CL-activated cytochrome c is a potent lipid peroxidase in the presence of H2O2 (38Iwase H. Takatori T. Nagao M. Iwadate K. Nakajima M. Monoepoxide production from linoleic acid by cytochrome c in the presence of cardiolipin.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222 (8630079): 83-8910.1006/bbrc.1996.0701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), based upon energetic and molecular orbital considerations, we hypothesized that cyt c could catalyze the cleavage of the vinyl ether linkage present in plasmalogens. To test this hypothesis, we purified equine heart cytochrome c from Sigma by Mono S FPLC using an NaCl gradient. The purified cyt c migrated as a single band by SDS-PAGE and was >99% pure by silver staining (Fig. S1). The purified cyt c was incubated with small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) comprising 1-O-1′-(Z)-octadecenyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (plasmenyl-SAPC) as host containing 10 mol % bovine heart CL (predominantly tetra-18:2 CL) as guest in the absence or presence of H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C. We focused on CL because it is markedly enriched in mitochondria and has been previously demonstrated to bind to cyt c inducing a conformational change that activates its cryptic peroxidase activity (34Kagan V.E.

Minimal plasmalogenase activity was observed in the absence or presence of H2O2 alone (Fig. 1A). Similarly, incubations with cyt c alone also resulted in barely detectable cleavage of the plasmenylcholine vinyl ether linkage (minor peak at m/z 566.4 by ESI-MS/MS) (Fig. 1A). Addition of H2O2 dramatically activated cyt c plasmalogenase activity, resulting in the robust generation of 2-AA-LPC (Fig. 1A). In contrast, similar experiments with diacyl SAPC-CL SUVs did not result in appreciable production of either 1-stearoyl-LPC or 2-AA-LPC in the presence of cyt c and H2O2 (data not shown). Incubation of SUVs comprising 1-O-1′-(Z)-octadecenyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (plasmenyl-SAPE) (45 mol %) containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) (45 mol %) and 10 mol % bovine heart CL in the presence of cyt c resulted in the production of 2-AA-LPE, which was markedly increased in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 1B). Further characterization of the plasmalogenase activity of cytochrome c revealed that production of 2-AA-LPC from plasmenyl-SAPC depended upon the amount of purified cytochrome c (Fig. 2A) with a maximum apparent turnover number of ≈6 at low concentrations of cyt c (1 μm). The reaction was also dependent on the concentration of H2O2 (Fig. S2A) as well as on the mol % cardiolipin present in the host plasmenyl-SAPC vesicles (Fig. S2B). Kinetic analysis of reaction products at a fixed concentration of cytochrome c (5 μm) in the presence of H2O2 (200 μm) demonstrated a linear increase in 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE production utilizing plasmenyl-SAPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or plasmenyl-SAPE/POPC SUVs, respectively, each containing 10 mol % CL as guest to mimic physiologic conditions (Fig. S2C). The initial catalytic rates of vinyl ether cleavage were ∼50 nmol of 2-AA-LPC/min·mg of cyt c and ∼60 nmol of 2-AA-LPE/min·mg of cyt c. We next examined the susceptibility of the plasmalogenase reaction to various inhibitors. Importantly, a cyt c–specific mAb resulted in the nearly complete inhibition of H2O2-dependent cyt c plasmalogenase activity (Fig. 2B). Moreover, cyanide and azide inhibited the plasmalogenase activity as has been shown for inhibition of the peroxidase activity of cyt c (43Cadenas E. Boveris A. Chance B. Low-level chemiluminescence of hydroperoxide-supplemented cytochrome c.Biochem. J. 1980; 187 (6250533): 131-14010.1042/bj1870131Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Kim N.H. Kang J.H. Oxidative damage of DNA induced by the cytochrome c and hydrogen peroxide system.J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 39 (16889691): 452-456PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Although the singlet oxygen scavengers lycopene and β-carotene did not appreciably affect cyt c–mediated plasmalogenase activity, the lipid hydroperoxyl scavenger α-tocopherol markedly inhibited the measured plasmalogenase activity (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, bifonazole, a cytochrome P450 inhibitor that inhibits the peroxidase activity of cyt c (45Bakan A. Kapralov A.A. Bayir H. Hu F. Kagan V.E. Bahar I. Inhibition of peroxidase activity of cytochrome c: de novo compound discovery and validation.Mol. Pharmacol. 2015; 88 (26078313): 421-42710.1124/mol.115.097816Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), potently inhibited cyt c–mediated plasmalogenase activity (Fig. 2C). To rule out the possible contribution of free heme or free iron to the observed plasmalogenase activity, hemin or ferric chloride was substituted for cyt c in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Incubations with these reagents did not result in appreciable plasmalogenase activity (Fig. S3A). Additional experiments with catalase and nitric-oxide synthase revealed that these heme proteins exhibited <10% and no plasmalogenase activity compared with cyt c, respectively (Fig. S3B), suggesting that cytochrome c is relatively specific for cleavage of the plasmalogen vinyl ether linkage. We specifically point out that these results do not preclude the possibility that other heme proteins may also be capable of cleaving the plasmalogen vinyl ether bond. Collectively, these results firmly identify cytochrome c as an enzymic mediator of the cleavage of the plasmalogen vinyl ether linkage. To establish the regiospecificity of the arachidonoyl moiety in the lysolipids produced by cyt c–catalyzed plasmalogenase activity, full-mass MS2 analyses of the lysolipid products and authentic synthetic 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE standards were compared. Excellent matches of the full-mass MS2 spectra (shown as mirror plots) were obtained between the lysolipid reaction products and corresponding authentic 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE standards (Fig. 3, A and D). For 2-AA-LPC, the presence of a high abundance product ion at m/z 147.1 (i.e. sodiated ethylene phosphane) demonstrated the regiospecificity of the arachidonate group at the sn-2 position as described previously (46Han X.L. Gross R.W. Structural determination of lysophospholipid regioisomers by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 451-45710.1021/ja952326rCrossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We also performed high-mass-accuracy MS1 and MS2 analyses of the 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE assay products by HRAM MS. Each of the measured masses of the molecular ion and product ions for 2-AA-LPC and 2-AA-LPE were within ±2 ppm of their calculated theoretical masses (Fig. 3, B, C, E, and F). To determine the reaction products resulting from oxidative cleavage of the vinyl ether bond, we utilized synergistic derivatization strategies to avoid the rapid postsource decay of the anticipated aldehyde reaction products. After incubation of cyt c with plasmenyl-SAPC/CL (90:10) SUVs in the presence of H2O2, the resultant aldehydes were derivatized with O-benzylhydroxylamine (BOA). High-mass-accuracy MS spectra of aldehyde BOA derivatives demonstrated an intense molecular ion at m/z 390.3365 (Fig. 4A), indicative of the anticipated product of the C18:0 α-hydroxyaldehyde BOA adduct. Fragmentation of the molecular ion at m/z 390.3365 resulted in the appearance of a predominant peak at 372.3242 resulting from loss of H2O (Fig. 4B). Similar BOA derivative ions were obtained when plasmenyl-SAPE/POPC/CL vesicles were used as substrate (Fig. 4, C and D). To further confirm the presence of the hydroxyl group in the resultant aldehyde product, dimethylglycine (DMG) was used to derivatize the hydroxyl groups. An intense molecular ion at m/z 370.3328 corresponding to the mass of the C18:0 α-hydroxyaldehyd"
https://openalex.org/W2792021252,"Phylogenetic relationships between thirteen species of downy mildew and 103 species of Phytophthora (plant-pathogenic oomycetes) were investigated with two nuclear and four mitochondrial loci, using several likelihood-based approaches. Three Phytophthora taxa and all downy mildew taxa were excluded from the previously recognized subgeneric clades of Phytophthora, though all were strongly supported within the paraphyletic genus. Downy mildews appear to be polyphyletic, with graminicolous downy mildews (GDM), brassicolous downy mildews (BDM) and downy mildews with colored conidia (DMCC) forming a clade with the previously unplaced Phytophthora taxon totara; downy mildews with pyriform haustoria (DMPH) were placed in their own clade with affinities to the obligate biotrophic P. cyperi. Results suggest the recognition of four additional clades within Phytophthora, but few relationships between clades could be resolved. Trees containing all twenty extant downy mildew genera were produced by adding partial coverage of seventeen additional downy mildew taxa; these trees supported the monophyly of the BDMs, DMCCs and DMPHs but suggested that the GDMs are paraphyletic in respect to the BDMs or polyphyletic. Incongruence between nuclear-only and mitochondrial-only trees suggests introgression may have occurred between several clades, particularly those containing biotrophs, questioning whether obligate biotrophic parasitism and other traits with polyphyletic distributions arose independently or were horizontally transferred. Phylogenetic approaches may be limited in their ability to resolve some of the complex relationships between the “subgeneric” clades of Phytophthora, which include twenty downy mildew genera and hundreds of species."
https://openalex.org/W2792355154,"Kinematic analysis of upper limb reaching provides insight into the central nervous system control of movements. Until recently, kinematic examination of motor control has been limited to studies conducted in traditional research laboratories because motion capture equipment used for data collection is not easily portable and expensive. A recently developed markerless system, the Leap Motion Controller (LMC), is a portable and inexpensive tracking device that allows recording of 3D hand and finger position. The main goal of this study was to assess the concurrent reliability and validity of the LMC as compared to the Optotrak, a criterion-standard motion capture system, for measures of temporal accuracy and peak velocity during the performance of upper limb, visually-guided movements. In experiment 1, 14 participants executed aiming movements to visual targets presented on a computer monitor. Bland-Altman analysis was conducted to assess the validity and limits of agreement for measures of temporal accuracy (movement time, duration of deceleration interval), peak velocity, and spatial accuracy (endpoint accuracy). In addition, a one-sample t-test was used to test the hypothesis that the error difference between measures obtained from Optotrak and LMC is zero. In experiment 2, 15 participants performed a Fitts’ type aiming task in order to assess whether the LMC is capable of assessing a well-known speed-accuracy trade-off relationship. Experiment 3 assessed the temporal coordination pattern during the performance of a sequence consisting of a reaching, grasping, and placement task in 15 participants. Results from the t-test showed that the error difference in temporal measures was significantly different from zero. Based on the results from the 3 experiments, the average temporal error in movement time was 40±44 ms, and the error in peak velocity was 0.024±0.103 m/s. The limits of agreement between the LMC and Optotrak for spatial accuracy measures ranged between 2–5 cm. Although the LMC system is a low-cost, highly portable system, which could facilitate collection of kinematic data outside of the traditional laboratory settings, the temporal and spatial errors may limit the use of the device in some settings."
https://openalex.org/W2793690962,"Bone formation is linked with osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the bone marrow. Microgravity in spaceflight is known to reduce bone formation. In this study, we used a real microgravity environment of the SJ-10 Recoverable Scientific Satellite to examine the effects of space microgravity on the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). hMSCs were induced toward osteogenic differentiation for 2 and 7 d in a cell culture device mounted on the SJ-10 satellite. The satellite returned to Earth after going through space experiments in orbit for 12 d, and cell samples were harvested and analyzed for differentiation potentials. The results showed that space microgravity inhibited osteogenic differentiation and resulted in adipogenic differentiation, even under osteogenic induction conditions. Under space microgravity, the expression of 10 genes specific for osteogenesis decreased, including collagen family members, alkaline phosphatase ( ALP), and runt-related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2), whereas the expression of 4 genes specific for adipogenesis increased, including adipsin ( CFD), leptin ( LEP), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β ( CEBPB), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ( PPARG). In the analysis of signaling pathways specific for osteogenesis, we found that the expression and activity of RUNX2 was inhibited, expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 ( BMP2) and activity of SMAD1/5/9 were decreased, and activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK-1/2 declined significantly under space microgravity. These data indicate that space microgravity plays a dual role by decreasing RUNX2 expression and activity through the BMP2/SMAD and integrin/FAK/ERK pathways. In addition, we found that space microgravity increased p38 MAPK and protein kinase B (AKT) activities, which are important for the promotion of adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Space microgravity significantly decreased the expression of Tribbles homolog 3 ( TRIB3), a repressor of adipogenic differentiation. Y15, a specific inhibitor of FAK activity, was used to inhibit the activity of FAK under normal gravity; Y15 decreased protein expression of TRIB3. Therefore, it appears that space microgravity decreased FAK activity and thereby reduced TRIB3 expression and derepressed AKT activity. Under space microgravity, the increase in p38 MAPK activity and the derepression of AKT activity seem to synchronously lead to the activation of the signaling pathway specifically promoting adipogenesis.-Zhang, C., Li, L., Jiang, Y., Wang, C., Geng, B., Wang, Y., Chen, J., Liu, F., Qiu, P., Zhai, G., Chen, P., Quan, R., Wang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2794117735,"The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a complex structure that protects the pathogen in hostile environments. Peptidoglycan (PG), which helps determine the morphology of the cell envelope, undergoes substantial remodeling under stress. This meshwork of linear chains of sugars, cross-linked through attached peptides, is generated through the sequential action of enzymes termed transglycosylases and transpeptidases. The Mtb genome encodes two classical transglycosylases and four transpeptidases, the functions of which are not fully elucidated. Here, we present work on the yet uncharacterized transpeptidase PbpA and a nonclassical transglycosylase RodA. We elucidate their roles in regulating in vitro growth and in vivo survival of pathogenic mycobacteria. We find that RodA and PbpA are required for regulating cell length, but do not affect mycobacterial growth. Biochemical analyses show PbpA to be a classical transpeptidase, whereas RodA is identified to be a member of an emerging class of noncanonical transglycosylases. Phosphorylation of RodA at Thr-463 modulates its biological function. In a guinea pig infection model, RodA and PbpA are found to be required for both bacterial survival and formation of granuloma structures, thus underscoring the importance of these proteins in mediating mycobacterial virulence in the host. Our results emphasize the fact that whereas redundant enzymes probably compensate for the absence of RodA or PbpA during in vitro growth, the two proteins play critical roles for the survival of the pathogen inside its host."
https://openalex.org/W2791597424,"Background and purpose Liver disease, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but little is known about its relationship with ischemic stroke. Methods In the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort of 30,239 American black and white adults, we assessed baseline NAFLD as fatty liver index (FLI) >60, and assessed liver biomarkers aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and the AST/ALT ratio and risk of incident ischemic stroke over 5.8 years using a case-cohort study design. Results Considering 572 strokes and a 1,017-person cohort sample, NAFLD was inversely associated with stroke risk in men (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.96), as was being in the highest ALT quintile versus the lowest (HR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.78) and the highest versus lowest GGT quintile (HR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.85), but not in women. Conversely, FLI score above the 90th percentile was associated with increased stroke risk among women (HR: 2.26; 95% CI: 1.14–4.47), but not men. AST was not associated with stroke risk in either sex. AST/ALT ratio >2 was strongly associated with increased stroke risk in whites, but not blacks (HRs: 3.64; 95% CI: 1.42–9.35 and 0.97; 95% CI: 0.45–1.99, respectively; p for interaction = 0.03). Conclusions The relationships between NAFLD, liver biomarkers, and ischemic stroke are complex, and sex and race differences we observed require further study and confirmation."

These complex metabolites are generated from a common biosynthetic intermediate by the Stig cyclases in three mechanistic steps: a rare Cope rearrangement, 6-exo-trig cyclization, and electrophilic aromatic substitution. Here we report the structure of HpiC1, a Stig cyclase that catalyzes the formation of 12-epi-hapalindole U in vitro. The 1.5-Å structure revealed a dimeric assembly with two calcium ions per monomer and with the active sites located at the distal ends of the protein dimer. Mutational analysis and computational methods uncovered key residues for an acid-catalyzed [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, as well as specific determinants that control the position of terminal electrophilic aromatic substitution, leading to a switch from hapalindole to fischerindole alkaloids."
https://openalex.org/W2790994954,"Members of the Drosophila behavior human splicing (DBHS) protein family are nuclear proteins implicated in many layers of nuclear functions, including RNA biogenesis as well as DNA repair. Definitive of the DBHS protein family, the conserved DBHS domain provides a dimerization platform that is critical for the structural integrity and function of these proteins. The three human DBHS proteins, splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ), paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1), and non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO), form either homo- or heterodimers; however, the relative affinity and mechanistic details of preferential heterodimerization are yet to be deciphered. Here we report the crystal structure of a SFPQ/PSPC1 heterodimer to 2.3-A resolution and analyzed the subtle structural differences between the SFPQ/PSPC1 heterodimer and the previously characterized SFPQ homodimer. Analytical ultracentrifugation to estimate the dimerization equilibrium of the SFPQ-containing dimers revealed that the SFPQ-containing dimers dissociate at low micromolar concentrations and that the heterodimers have higher affinities than the homodimer. Moreover, we observed that the apparent dissociation constant for the SFPQ/PSPC1 heterodimer was over 6-fold lower than that of the SFPQ/NONO heterodimer. We propose that these differences in dimerization affinity may represent a potential mechanism by which PSPC1 at a lower relative cellular abundance can outcompete NONO to heterodimerize with SFPQ."
https://openalex.org/W2791149710,"Many scientists studying animal welfare appear to hold a hedonistic concept of welfare -whereby welfare is ultimately reducible to an animal's subjective experience. The substantial advances in assessing animal's subjective experience have enabled us to take a step back to consider whether such indicators are all one needs to know if one is interested in the welfare of an individual. To investigate this claim, we randomly assigned participants (n = 502) to read one of four vignettes describing a hypothetical chimpanzee and asked them to make judgments about the animal's welfare. Vignettes were designed to systematically manipulate the descriptive mental states the chimpanzee was described as experiencing: feels good (FG) vs. feels bad (FB); as well as non-subjective features of the animal's life: natural living and physical healthy (NH) vs. unnatural life and physically unhealthy (UU); creating a fully-crossed 2 (subjective experience) X 2 (objective life value) experimental design. Multiple regression analysis showed welfare judgments depended on the objective features of the animal's life more than they did on how the animal was feeling: a chimpanzee living a natural life with negative emotions was rated as having better welfare than a chimpanzee living an unnatural life with positive emotions. We also found that the supposedly more purely psychological concept of happiness was also influenced by normative judgments about the animal's life. For chimpanzees with positive emotions, those living a more natural life were rated as happier than those living an unnatural life. Insofar as analyses of animal welfare are assumed to be reflective of folk intuitions, these findings raise questions about a strict hedonistic account of animal welfare. More generally, this research demonstrates the potential utility of using empirical methods to address conceptual problems in animal welfare and ethics."
https://openalex.org/W2791327131,"Cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata), an important vegetable crop in the Brassicaceae family, is economically important worldwide. In the process of hybrid seed production, Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (OguCMS), controlled by the mitochondrial gene orf138, has been extensively used for cabbage hybrid production with complete and stable male sterility. To identify the critical genes and pathways involved in the sterility and to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, the anther of OguCMS line R2P2CMS and the fertile line R2P2 were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) proteome analysis. RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line. This resulted in the failed deposition of sporopollenin on the pollen resulting in sterility. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism underlying OguCMS in cabbage."
https://openalex.org/W2792735460,"Most Chinese lithic industries dated between 300,000 and 40,000 are characterized by the absence of Levallois debitage, the persistence of core-and-flake knapping, the rarity of prepared cores, their reduction with direct hard hammer percussion, and the rarity of retouched flakes. Here we report the discovery of seven bone soft hammers at the early hominin Lingjing site (Xuchang County, Henan) dated to 125,000-105,000. These artefacts represent the first instance of the use of bone as raw material to modify stone tools found at an East Asian early Late Pleistocene site. Three types of soft hammers are identified. The first consists of large bone flakes resulting from butchery of large herbivores that were utilized as such for expedient stone tools retouching or resharpening. The second involved the fracture of weathered bone from medium size herbivores to obtain elongated splinters shaped by percussion into sub-rectangular artefacts. Traces observed on these objects indicate intensive and possibly recurrent utilization, which implies their curation over time. The last consists of antler, occasionally used. Lingjing bone tools complement what we know about archaic hominin cultural adaptations in East Asia and highlight behavioural consistencies that could not be inferred from other cultural proxies. This discovery provides a new dimension to the debate surrounding the existence of the Middle Palaeolithic in the region. The attribution of East Asian sites to the Middle Palaeolithic assumes that cultural traits such as the Levallois method represent evolutionary hallmarks applicable to regions of the world different from those in which they were originally found. Here, we promote an approach that consists in identifying, possibly from different categories of material culture, the original features of each regional cultural trajectory and understanding the behavioural and cognitive implications they may have had for past hominin populations."
https://openalex.org/W2794157382,"Cell fusion-mediated formation of multinuclear osteoclasts (OCs) plays a key role in bone resorption. It is reported that 2 unique OC-specific fusogens [i.e., OC-stimulatory transmembrane protein (OC-STAMP) and dendritic cell–specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP)], and permissive fusogen CD9, are involved in OC fusion. In contrast to DC-STAMP-knockout (KO) mice, which show the osteopetrotic phenotype, OC-STAMP-KO mice show no difference in systemic bone mineral density. Nonetheless, according to the ligature-induced periodontitis model, significantly lower level of bone resorption was found in OC-STAMP-KO mice compared to WT mice. Anti-OC-STAMP-neutralizing mAb down-modulated in vitro: 1) the emergence of large multinuclear tartrate- resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells, 2) pit formation, and 3) mRNA and protein expression of CD9, but not DC-STAMP, in receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-stimulated OC precursor cells (OCps). While anti–DC-STAMP-mAb also down-regulated RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, it had no effect on CD9 expression. In our mouse model, systemic administration of anti–OC-STAMP-mAb suppressed the expression of CD9 mRNA, but not DC-STAMP mRNA, in periodontal tissue, along with diminished alveolar bone loss and reduced emergence of CD9+ OCps and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinuclear OCs. The present study demonstrated that OC-STAMP partners CD9 to promote periodontal bone destruction by up-regulation of fusion during osteoclastogenesis, suggesting that anti–OC-STAMP-mAb may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic regimen for periodontitis.—Ishii, T., Ruiz-Torruella, M., Ikeda, A., Shindo, S., Movila, A., Mawardi, H., Albassam, A., Kayal, R.

We developed a workflow based on biomarker identification and network-based pathway analysis that allowed us to describe different deregulated pathways. In addition to muscle-related functions, we identified other biological processes such as apoptosis, signaling in the immune system and neurotrophin signaling as significantly modulated in patients compared with controls. Moreover, our network-based analysis identified the involvement of FoxO transcription factors as putative regulators of different pathways. On the whole, this study provided a global view of the molecular processes involved in Duchenne muscular dystrophy that are decipherable from serum proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2793038449,"Hepatic gluconeogenesis is essential to maintain blood glucose levels, and its abnormal activation leads to hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis remain to be fully defined. In this study, using murine hepatocytes and a liver-specific knockout mouse model, we explored the physiological role of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) in regulating hepatic glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanism. We found that NF-Y targets the gluconeogenesis pathway in the liver. Hepatic NF-Y expression was effectively induced by cAMP, glucagon, and fasting in vivo. Lentivirus-mediated NF-Y overexpression in Hepa1-6 hepatocytes markedly raised the gluconeogenic gene expression and cellular glucose production compared with empty vector control cells. Conversely, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of NF-Y subunit A (NF-YA) attenuated gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production. We also provide evidence indicating that CRE-loxP-mediated, liver-specific NF-YA knockout compromises hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, luciferase reporter gene assays and ChIP analysis indicated that NF-Y activates transcription of the gluconeogenic genes Pck1 and G6pc, by encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase), respectively, via directly binding to the CCAAT regulatory sequence motif in their promoters. Of note, NF-Y enhanced gluconeogenesis by interacting with cAMP-responsive element–binding protein (CREB). Overall, our results reveal a previously unrecognized physiological function of NF-Y in controlling glucose metabolism by up-regulating the gluconeogenic genes Pck1 and G6pc. Modulation of hepatic NF-Y expression may therefore offer an attractive therapeutic approach to manage type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2759600539,"The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC provides an efficient platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans at over 850,000 CpGs. Model organisms such as mice do not currently benefit from an equivalent array. Here we used this array to measure DNA methylation in mice. We defined probes targeting conserved regions and performed differential methylation analysis and compared between the array-based assay and affinity-based DNA sequencing of methyl-CpGs (MBD-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Mouse samples consisted of 11 liver DNA from two strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), that varied widely in age. Linear regression was applied to detect differential methylation. In total, 13,665 probes (1.6% of total probes) aligned to conserved CpGs. Beta-values (β-value) for these probes showed a distribution similar to that in humans. Overall, there was high concordance in methylation signal between the EPIC array and MBD-seq (Pearson correlation r = 0.70, p-value < 0.0001). However, the EPIC probes had higher quantitative sensitivity at CpGs that are hypo- (β-value < 0.3) or hypermethylated (β-value > 0.7). In terms of differential methylation, no EPIC probe detected a significant difference between age groups at a Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of 10%, and the MBD-seq performed better at detecting age-dependent change in methylation. However, the top most significant probe for age (cg13269407; uncorrected p-value = 1.8 x 10−5) is part of the clock CpGs used to estimate the human epigenetic age. For strain, 219 EPIC probes detected significant differential methylation (FDR cutoff 10%) with ~80% CpGs associated with higher methylation in D2. This higher methylation profile in D2 compared to B6 was also replicated by the MBD-seq data. To summarize, we found only a small subset of EPIC probes that target conserved sites. However, for this small subset the array provides a reliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice."

The aim of this study was to determine the content of group 5 major allergens in pollen grains of agriculturally important grass species/cultivars. For each cultivar flowering dates and pollen production of cut anthers were observed in the field and in a climate chamber, respectively. An ELISA was used to quantify the group 5 allergens (Phl p5) in pollen extracts which were gained from the grass species Kentucky bluegrass, perennial rye grass, timothy, cocksfoot, annual / Italian rye grass, hybrid rye grass and festulolium. The group 5 allergen content of species varied between 0.01 ng (Kentucky bluegrass) and 0.06 ng (timothy) per pollen grain. On cultivar level the pollen allergenic content differed up to 74-times within the selected grass species. Results from this study might be helpful for the reduction of allergen exposure coming from agriculture grass production e.g. by an adapted grass selection or by the cultivation of grasses with low allergenic content in plant breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2789259981,"Polarity complexes, including the PAR (Partitioning-defective), CRB (Crumbs) and SCRIB (Scribble) complexes, are required for the physiologic establishment, stabilization, and maintenance of a functional apical-basolateral polarity. Inactivation of some of the polarity complexes results in cystic kidneys, and apical-basolateral polarity defects are commonly observed in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD); however, little is known about the role that polarity complexes play in ADPKD. Here, we demonstrate that Scribble, a core protein of the SCRIB complex, is down-regulated in ADPKD cell lines and the zebrafish model of this disease ( pkd2 morphants). Overexpression of Scribble could reduce cyst formation in pkd2 morphants, and loss of scrib led to a dilated pronephric duct in zebrafish. Furthermore, the Hippo signaling pathway was inactivated in scrib mutants and pkd2 morphants in which Yes-associated protein (YAP), which is physiologically located in the cytoplasm, was translocated to the nucleus. Of note, overexpression of cytoplasmic YAP, instead of nuclear YAP, could reduce cyst formation in pkd2 morphants. Consistently, knockout of yap resulted in cystic kidneys in zebrafish, which was rescued by the overexpression of cytoplasmic YAP, but not nuclear YAP. Finally, scrib and yap had a genetic interaction with pkd2 in cyst formation, and the overexpression of Scribble attenuated the down-regulation of cytoplasmic YAP in ADPKD. Altogether, our data indicate that Scribble induces the phosphorylation of YAP and, consequently, influences cyst formation in ADPKD by mediating YAP nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.-Xu, D., Lv, J., He, L., Fu, L., Hu, R., Cao, Y., Mei, C.

https://openalex.org/W2792825168,"Autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism (ARJP) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease in which 50% of affected individuals harbor mutations in the gene encoding the E3 ligase parkin. Parkin regulates the mitochondrial recycling pathway, which is induced by oxidative stress. In its native state, parkin is auto-inhibited by its N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, which blocks the binding site for an incoming E2∼ubiquitin conjugate, needed for parkin’s ubiquitination activity. Parkin is activated via phosphorylation of Ser-65 in its Ubl domain by PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and a ubiquitin molecule phosphorylated at a position equivalent to Ser-65 in parkin. Here we have examined the underlying molecular mechanism of phosphorylation of parkin’s Ubl domain carrying ARJP-associated substitutions and how altered phosphorylation modulates parkin activation and ubiquitination. We found that three substitutions in the Ubl domain (G12R, R33Q, and R42P) significantly decrease PINK1’s ability to phosphorylate the Ubl domain. We noted that two basic loss-of-function substitutions (R33Q and R42P) are close to acidic patches in the proposed PINK1–parkin interface, indicating that ionic interactions at this site may be important for efficient parkin phosphorylation. Increased auto-ubiquitination with unique ubiquitin chain patterns was observed for two other Ubl domain substitutions (G12R and T55I), suggesting that these substitutions, along with phosphorylation, increase parkin degradation. Moreover, Ubl domain phosphorylation decreased its affinity for the potential effector protein ataxin-3, which edits ubiquitin chain building by parkin. Overall, our work provides a framework for the mechanisms of parkin’s loss-of-function, indicating an interplay between ARJP-associated substitutions and phosphorylation of its Ubl domain."

Molecular scaffolds, such as 14-3-3 proteins, facilitate such organization, and we have previously identified 14-3-3ζ as an essential scaffold in adipocyte differentiation.

Thus, inducing pre-adipocytes to differentiate may permit the identification of novel differentiation-specific factors within the 14-3-3ζ interactome and reveal pathways and biological processes that are essential to the development of a mature adipocyte. To elucidate the 14-3-3ζ interactome during adipogenesis, we employed a proteomic-based discovery approach. Herein, we report that previously established factors required for adipogenesis, such as Ptrf/Cavin1 and Phb2 (Prohibitin-2), can be detected in the interactome, and novel factors, such as those involved in RNA splicing, are also enriched in the interactome during differentiation. To test for their roles in adipogenesis, siRNA knockdown approaches were used and revealed the requirement for RNA-splicing factors, such as Hnrpf, Sfpq, and Ddx6. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of examining the interactome of 14-3-3 proteins in the context of a physiological process, such as adipocyte differentiation, and highlight the ability to find novel functional regulators through this approach. Understanding how the interactome is influenced by disease states, such as obesity, may lead to the identification of novel proteins that contribute to disease pathogenesis. To examine how adipocyte differentiation influences the 14-3-3ζ interactome, we generated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) 3The abbreviations used are: MEFmouse embryonic fibroblastsiConcontrol siRNATAPtandem affinity purification. derived from transgenic mice that moderately overexpress a TAP-epitope–tagged human 14-3-3ζ molecule (TAP–14-3-3ζ) (4Lim G.E.

Thus, we utilized affinity proteomics to identify interacting proteins that associate with 14-3-3ζ during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1A). The interactome of 14-3-3ζ at 24 h postinduction was examined because key signaling events underlying murine adipocyte differentiation occur during the first 24–48 h (2Cristancho A.G.

An enrichment of differentiation-dependent 14-3-3ζ-interacting proteins associated with RNA splicing, translation, protein transport, and nucleic acid transport was detected using gene ontology to define their biological processes (17Szklarczyk D.

Thus, these proteomic data demonstrate the dynamic nature of the 14-3-3ζ interactome and suggest that 14-3-3ζ may regulate multiple processes, such as RNA processing, during adipocyte

SLC26 member 6 (SLC26A6 or CFEX/PAT-1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) co-localize to the apical membrane of pancreatic duct cells, where they act in concert to drive HCO3− and fluid secretion. In contrast, in the small intestine, SLC26A6 serves as the major pathway for oxalate secretion. However, little is known about the function of Slc26a6 in murine salivary glands. Here, RNA sequencing–based transcriptional profiling and Western blots revealed that Slc26a6 is highly expressed in mouse submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. Slc26a6 localized to the apical membrane of salivary gland acinar cells with no detectable immunostaining in the ducts. CHO-K1 cells transfected with mouse Slc26a6 exchanged Cl− for oxalate and HCO3−, whereas two other anion exchangers known to be expressed in salivary gland acinar cells, Slc4a4 and Slc4a9, mediated little, if any, Cl−/oxalate exchange. Of note, both Cl−/oxalate exchange and Cl−/HCO3− exchange were significantly reduced in acinar cells isolated from the submandibular glands of Slc26a6−/− mice. Oxalate secretion in submandibular saliva also decreased significantly in Slc26a6−/− mice, but HCO3− secretion was unaffected. Taken together, our findings indicate that Slc26a6 is located at the apical membrane of salivary gland acinar cells, where it mediates Cl−/oxalate exchange and plays a critical role in the secretion of oxalate into saliva.

https://openalex.org/W2792235400,"Late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual impairment in the elderly with a complex etiology. The most important non-modifiable risk factors for onset and progression of late AMD are age and genetic risk factors, however, little is known about the interplay between genetics and age or sex. Here, we conducted a large-scale age- and sex-stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 1000 Genomes imputed genome-wide and ExomeChip data (>12 million variants). The data were established by the International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC) from 16,144 late AMD cases and 17,832 controls. Our systematic search for interaction effects yielded significantly stronger effects among younger individuals at two known AMD loci (near CFH and ARMS2/HTRA1). Accounting for age and gene-age interaction using a joint test identified two additional AMD loci compared to the previous main effect scan. One of these two is a novel AMD GWAS locus, near the retinal clusterin-like protein (CLUL1) gene, and the other, near the retinaldehyde binding protein 1 (RLBP1), was recently identified in a joint analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial variants. Despite considerable power in our data, neither sex-dependent effects nor effects with opposite directions between younger and older individuals were observed. This is the first genome-wide interaction study to incorporate age, sex and their interaction with genetic effects for late AMD. Results diminish the potential for a role of sex in the etiology of late AMD yet highlight the importance and existence of age-dependent genetic effects."
https://openalex.org/W2745305379,"In this study, we assess the dynamic evolution of short-term correlation, long-term cointegration and Error Correction Model (hereafter referred to as ECM)-based long-term Granger causality between each pair of US, UK, and Eurozone stock markets from 1980 to 2015 using the rolling-window technique. A comparative analysis of pairwise dynamic integration and causality of stock markets, measured in common and domestic currency terms, is conducted to evaluate comprehensively how exchange rate fluctuations affect the time-varying integration among the S&P 500, FTSE 100 and EURO STOXX 50 indices. The results obtained show that the dynamic correlation, cointegration and ECM-based long-run Granger causality vary significantly over the whole sample period. The degree of dynamic correlation and cointegration between pairs of stock markets rises in periods of high volatility and uncertainty, especially under the influence of economic, financial and political shocks. Meanwhile, we observe the weaker and decreasing correlation and cointegration among the three developed stock markets during the recovery periods. Interestingly, the most persistent and significant cointegration among the three developed stock markets exists during the 2007–09 global financial crisis. Finally, the exchange rate fluctuations, also influence the dynamic integration and causality between all pairs of stock indices, with that influence increasing under the local currency terms. Our results suggest that the potential for diversifying risk by investing in the US, UK and Eurozone stock markets is limited during the periods of economic, financial and political shocks."
https://openalex.org/W2790439189,"The contribution of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) to cholestatic liver disease (CLD) remains unknown. We investigated the role and mechanism of GSK-3β in vivo in liver tissues of patients with CLD and the bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model and in vitro using a hepatic progenitor cell (HPC) and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) coculture system. In liver tissues of patients with CLD, expression of the inactive form of GSK-3β, phospho-GSK-3β(Ser9), was increased in HPCs. GSK-3β inhibition by SB216763 treatment aggravated liver fibrosis and elevated the expression of osteopontin (OPN) in the BDL mouse model. OPN was significantly overexpressed in liver tissues and serum from patients with CLD. In an HPC and HSC coculture system, inhibition of GSK-3β induced OPN production, which activated HSCs in a cholestatic environment. The expression of activator protein 1 (AP-1), an important downstream transcription factor of GSK-3β, was significantly increased in liver tissues of patients with CLD and SB216763-treated BDL mice. Finally, OPN expression was directly modulated by AP-1. These observations indicate that GSK-3β inhibition up-regulates OPN expression via AP-1 activation, which accelerates the progression of cholestatic liver fibrosis in patients with CLD and in BDL mice.—Zhuang, S., Hua, X., He, K., Zhou, T., Zhang, J., Wu, H., Ma, X., Xia, Q., Zhang J.

https://openalex.org/W2792320820,"The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is a receptor tyrosine kinase with critical roles in various biological processes. Recent results from clinical trials targeting IGF1R indicate that IGF1R signaling pathways are more complex than previously thought. Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that the function of many proteins can be understood only in the context of a network of interactions. To that end, we sought to profile IGF1R–protein interactions with the proximity-labeling technique BioID. We applied BioID by generating a HEK293A cell line that stably expressed the BirA* biotin ligase fused to the IGF1R. Following stimulation by IGF1, biotinylated proteins were analyzed by MS. This screen identified both known and previously unknown interactors of IGF1R. One of the novel interactors was sorting nexin 6 (SNX6), a protein that forms part of the retromer complex, which is involved in intracellular protein sorting. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that IGF1R and SNX6 physically interact. SNX6 knockdown resulted in a dramatic diminution of IGF1-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but did not affect IGF1R internalization. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that the SNX6 knockdown perturbed the association between IGF1R and the key adaptor proteins insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and SHC adaptor protein 1 (SHC1). Intriguingly, even in the absence of stimuli, SNX6 overexpression significantly increased Akt phosphorylation. Our study confirms the utility of proximity-labeling methods, such as BioID, to screen for interactors of cell-surface receptors and has uncovered a role of one of these interactors, SNX6, in the IGF1R signaling cascade.

Using co-immunoprecipitation, we confirmed that IGF1R and SNX6 physically interact. SNX6 knockdown resulted in a dramatic diminution of IGF1-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but did not affect IGF1R internalization. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that the SNX6 knockdown perturbed the association between IGF1R and the key adaptor proteins insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and SHC adaptor protein 1 (SHC1). Intriguingly, even in the absence of stimuli, SNX6 overexpression significantly increased Akt phosphorylation. Our study confirms the utility of proximity-labeling methods, such as BioID, to screen for interactors of cell-surface receptors and has uncovered a role of one of these interactors, SNX6, in the IGF1R signaling cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2761883856,"Currently, non-invasive methods for studying the human brain do not routinely and reliably measure spike-rate-dependent signals, independent of responses such as hemodynamic coupling (fMRI) and subthreshold neuronal synchrony (oscillations and event-related potentials). In contrast, invasive methods—microelectrode recordings and electrocorticography (ECoG)—have recently measured broadband power elevation in field potentials (~50–200 Hz) as a proxy for locally averaged spike rates. Here, we sought to detect and quantify stimulus-related broadband responses using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Extracranial measurements like MEG and EEG have multiple global noise sources and relatively low signal-to-noise ratios; moreover high frequency artifacts from eye movements can be confounded with stimulus design and mistaken for signals originating from brain activity. For these reasons, we developed an automated denoising technique that helps reveal the broadband signal of interest. Subjects viewed 12-Hz contrast-reversing patterns in the left, right, or bilateral visual field. Sensor time series were separated into evoked (12-Hz amplitude) and broadband components (60–150 Hz). In all subjects, denoised broadband responses were reliably measured in sensors over occipital cortex, even in trials without microsaccades. The broadband pattern was stimulus-dependent, with greater power contralateral to the stimulus. Because we obtain reliable broadband estimates with short experiments (~20 minutes), and with sufficient signal-to-noise to distinguish responses to different stimuli, we conclude that MEG broadband signals, denoised with our method, offer a practical, non-invasive means for characterizing spike-rate-dependent neural activity for addressing scientific questions about human brain function."
https://openalex.org/W2789568522,"The present research addresses the question of whether regulatory-mode orientations affect self-forgiveness. We expected that people with a strong locomotion orientation would be more inclined to self-forgiveness because of their tendencies toward movement and change, which focus them on the future, whereas people with a strong assessment orientation would refrain from self-forgiveness due to their evaluative tendencies which focus them on the past. These hypotheses were supported by the results in four studies that tested the relation between regulatory modes and self-forgiveness by measuring (Studies 1, 3 and 4) and manipulating (Study 2) regulatory-mode-orientations. Finally, in Study 4 we examined more closely our hypothesis that the relation between self-forgiveness and regulatory modes is mediated by past and future temporal foci. The implications of the results for regulatory mode theory are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2790059092,"In this study, we investigated: i) the effects of bed rest and a subsequent physical training program on metabolic cost (Cw), mechanical work and efficiency during walking in older and young men; ii) the mechanisms underlying the higher Cw observed in older than young men.Twenty-three healthy male subjects (N = 16 older adults, age 59.6±3.4 years; N = 7 young, age: 23.1±2.9 years) participated in this study. The subjects underwent 14 days of bed rest followed by two weeks of physical training (6 sessions). Cw, mechanical work, efficiency, and co-contraction time of proximal muscles (vastus lateralis and biceps femoris) and distal muscles (gastrocnemius medialis and tibialis anterior) were measured during walking at 0.83, 1.11, 1.39, 1.67 m·s-1 before bed rest (pre-BR), after bed rest (post-BR) and after physical training (post-PT).No effects of bed rest and physical training were observed on the analysed parameters in either group. Older men showed higher Cw and lower efficiency at each speed (average +25.1 and -20.5%, P<0.001, respectively) compared to young. Co-contraction time of proximal and distal muscles were higher in older than in young men across the different walking speeds (average +30.0 and +110.3%, P<0.05, respectively).The lack of bed rest and physical training effects on the parameters analyzed in this study may be explained by the healthy status of both young and older men, which could have mitigated the effects of these interventions on walking motor function. On the other hand, the fact that older adults showed greater Cw, overall higher co-contraction time of antagonist lower limb muscles, and lower efficiency compared to the young cohort throughout a wide range of walking speed may suggest that older adults sacrificed economy of walking to improve stability."
https://openalex.org/W2793703459,"Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity is maintained in homeostasis by an expanding list of molecular determinants. However, the molecular components and the regulatory mechanisms involved in its fine-tuning remain to be determined. Here, we identified C9orf140, a tumor-specific protein, as a novel Axin1-interacting protein by tandem-affinity purification and mass spectrometry. We further showed that C9orf140 is a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cultured cells as well as in zebrafish embryos. It functions upstream of β-catenin, outcompetes PP2A for binding to Axin1, influences the balance between phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of β-catenin, and ultimately compromises Wnt3A-induced β-catenin accumulation. Interestingly, Wnt-induced C9orf140 expression via β-catenin. We propose that C9orf140 mediates a negative feedback loop of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by interacting with Axin1. Our results advance the current understanding of the exquisite control of Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade, and provide evidence of the new role of C9orf140."
https://openalex.org/W2794013609,"Despite large efforts, datasets with few sightings are often available for rare species of marine megafauna that typically live at low densities. This paucity of data makes modelling the habitat of these taxa particularly challenging. We tested the predictive performance of different types of species distribution models fitted to decreasing numbers of sightings. Generalised additive models (GAMs) with three different residual distributions and the presence only model MaxEnt were tested on two megafauna case studies differing in both the number of sightings and ecological niches. From a dolphin (277 sightings) and an auk (1,455 sightings) datasets, we simulated rarity with a sighting thinning protocol by random sampling (without replacement) of a decreasing fraction of sightings. Better prediction of the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a narrow habitat (auk dataset) was expected compared to the distribution of a rarely sighted species occupying a broad habitat (dolphin dataset). We used the original datasets to set up a baseline model and fitted additional models on fewer sightings but keeping effort constant. Model predictive performance was assessed with mean squared error and area under the curve. Predictions provided by the models fitted to the thinned-out datasets were better than a homogeneous spatial distribution down to a threshold of approximately 30 sightings for a GAM with a Tweedie distribution and approximately 130 sightings for the other models. Thinning the sighting data for the taxon with narrower habitats seemed to be less detrimental to model predictive performance than for the broader habitat taxon. To generate reliable habitat modelling predictions for rarely sighted marine predators, our results suggest (1) using GAMs with a Tweedie distribution with presence-absence data and (2) implementing, as a conservative empirical measure, at least 50 sightings in the models."
https://openalex.org/W2793345817,"Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) has been investigated in several laser-induced animal models using pigs, rabbits and rats. However, laser-induced RVO has been rarely reported in mice, despite the impressive number of available mutants, ease of handling and cost effectiveness. The aim of this study was to further assess the feasibility of a RVO mouse model for gene expression analysis and its possible use to investigate effects of hypoxia.C57Bl/6J mice were injected with eosin Y for photo-sensitization. Subsequently, large retinal veins were laser-treated in one eye to induce vascular occlusion. Contralateral control eyes received non-occlusive retinal laser treatment sparing large vessels. The animals were followed for up to eight days and assessed by funduscopy, angiography, hypoxyprobe staining, histopathology and gene expression analysis by qPCR and RNA sequencing (RNAseq). Another group of mice was left untreated and studied at a single time point to determine baseline characteristics.Laser-induced RVO persisted in half of the treated veins for three days, and in a third of the veins for the whole observation period of 8 days. Funduscopy revealed large areas of retinal swelling in all laser-treated eyes, irrespective of vascular targeting or occlusion status. Damage of the outer retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and even choroid and sclera at the laser site was observed in histological sections. Genes associated with inflammation or cell damage were highly up-regulated in all laser-treated eyes as detected by RNAseq and qPCR. Retinal hypoxia was observed by hypoxyprobe staining in all RVO eyes for up to 5 days with a maximal extension at days 2 and 3, but no significant RVO-dependent changes in gene expression were detected for angiogenesis- or hypoxia-related genes.The laser-induced RVO mouse model is characterized by a predominant general inflammatory and tissue damage response, which may obscure distinct hypoxia- and angiogenesis-related effects. A non-occlusive laser treatment control is essential to allow for proper data interpretation and should be mandatory in animal studies of laser-induced RVO to dissect laser-induced tissue damage from vascular occlusion effects."
https://openalex.org/W2791025249,"Bcr-Abl (break-point cluster region-abelson), the oncogenic trigger of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), has previously been shown to up-regulate the expression and activity of sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1), which contributes to the proliferation of CML cells; however, the mechanism by which this increased expression of SMS1 is mediated remains unknown. In the current study, we show that Bcr-Abl enhances the expression of SMS1 via a 30-fold up-regulation of its transcription. Of most interest, the Bcr-Abl-regulated transcription of SMS1 is initiated from a novel transcription start site (TSS) that is just upstream of the open reading frame. This shift in TSS utilization generates an SMS1 mRNA with a substantially shorter 5′ UTR compared with its canonical mRNA. This shorter 5′ UTR imparts a 20-fold greater translational efficiency to SMS1 mRNA, which further contributes to the increase of its expression in CML cells. Therefore, our study demonstrates that Bcr-Abl increases SMS1 protein levels via 2 concerted mechanisms: up-regulation of transcription and enhanced translation as a result of the shift in TSS utilization. Remarkably, this is the first time that an oncogene—Bcr-Abl—has been demonstrated to drive such a mechanism that up-regulates the expression of a functionally important target gene, SMS1.—Moorthi, S., Burns, T.

As for the HCC group compared to the CHC group; miR-602, miR-122, miR-181b, miR-125a-5p, and miR-192 were significantly up regulated (fold change = 13, 3.1, 2.8, 1.6 & 1.56, P value = 0.01, 0.001, 0.000004, 0.002 & 0.007 respectively). Upon comparing the HCC group to the LC group; miR-199a-3p, miR-192, miR-122, miR-181b, miR-224, miR-125a-5p, and miR-885-5p were significantly up regulated (fold change = 5, 6.7, 2.3, 3, 2.5, 4.2 & 39.5 P value = 0.001025, 0.000024, 0.000472, 0.000278, 0.000004, 0.000075 & 0.0000001 respectively) whereas miR-22 was significantly down regulated (fold change = 0.57 P value = 0.00002). Only, miR-192, miR-122, miR-181b and miR-125a-5p were significant common miRNAs in CD133+ cells of the HCC group compared to the other non-malignant groups.We identified a miRNA panel comprised of four miRNAs (miR-192, miR-122, miR-181b and miR-125a-5p) that may serve as a molecular tool for characterization of the CD133+ cells associated with different stages of hepatocarinogensis. This panel may aid in developing a new target therapy specific for those CD133+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2792097339,"Humans employ various control strategies to initiate and maintain bodily movement. In case that the normal gait function is impaired, exoskeleton robots provide motor assistance during therapy. While the robotic control system builds on kinematic gait functions, the patient’s voluntary efforts to initiate motion also contribute to the effectiveness of the therapy process. However, it is currently not well understood how voluntary initiation as a subjective capacity affects the physiological level of motor control. In order to understand the functional nexus between voluntary initiation and motor control, we interviewed patients undergoing robotic gait rehabilitation with the HAL exoskeleton robot about their experience and command of voluntarily initiating forward gait while using the HAL system. Their reports provide phenomenal evidence for voluntary initiation as a distinct cognitive act that comes as phenomenal performance. Furthermore, phenomenal evidence about the functional relation of intention and initiation correlates with FIM-M gait scores. Based on the assumption that HAL reduces control-related difficulties of voluntarily initiating joint movement, we identified two cognitive control strategies, shaping and compensation of gait, that imply a heterarchic organization of the human system of action control."
https://openalex.org/W2791084738,"Calcyclin Binding Protein/(Siah-1 interacting protein) (CacyBP/SIP) acts as an oncogene in colorectal cancer. The nuclear accumulation of CacyBP/SIP has been linked to the proliferation of cancer cells. It has been reported that intracellular Ca2+ induces the nuclear translocation of CacyBP/SIP. However, the molecular mechanism of CacyBP/SIP nuclear translocation has yet to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to test whether the Ca2+-dependent binding partner S100 protein is involved in CacyBP/SIP nuclear translocation in colon cancer SW480 cells.The subcellular localization of endogenous CacyBP/SIP was observed following the stimulation of ionomycin or BAPTA/AM by immunofluorescence staining in SW480 cells. S100A6 small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were transfected into SW480 cells. Immunoprecipitation assays detected whether S100 protein is relevant to the nuclear translocation of CacyBP/SIP in response to changes in [Ca2+]i.We observed that endogenous CacyBP/SIP is translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus following the elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin in SW480 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the interaction between S100A6 and CacyBP/SIP was increased simultaneously with elevated Ca2+. Knockdown of S100A6 abolished the Ca2+ effect on the subcellular translocation of CacyBP/SIP.Thus, we demonstrated that S100A6 is required for the Ca2+-dependent nuclear translocation of CacyBP/SIP in colon cancer SW480 cells."

There are almost no identifiable targets for non-invasive diagnosis by positron emission tomography (PET) for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Over-expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is found on the cell surface of both pre-neoplastic lesions and invasive PDAC. Here, a RAGE-specific single chain (scFv) was developed, specific for PET imaging in syngeneic mouse models of PDAC. An anti-RAGE scFv conjugated with a sulfo-Cy5 fluorescence molecule showed high affinity and selectivity for RAGE expressing pancreatic tumor cells and genetically engineered KRASG12D mouse models of PDAC. An in vivo biodistribution study was performed with the 64Cu-radiolabled scFv in a syngeneic murine pancreatic cancer model, demonstrating both the feasibility and potential of an anti-RAGE scFv for detection of PDAC. These studies hold great promise for translation into the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2791238753,"Despite much progress, few genetic findings for schizophrenia have been assessed by functional validation experiments at the molecular level. We previously reported evidence for genetic linkage of broadly defined schizophrenia to chromosome 17q25 in a sample of 24 multiplex families. 2,002 SNPs under this linkage peak were analyzed for evidence of linkage disequilibrium using the posterior probability of linkage (PPL) framework. SNP rs1060120 produced the strongest evidence for association, with a PPLD|L score of 0.21. This SNP is located within the 3'UTR of the histone gene H3F3B and colocalizes with potential gene target miR-616. A custom miRNA target prediction program predicted that the binding of miR-616 to H3F3B transcripts would be altered by the allelic variants of rs1060120. We used dual luciferase assays to experimentally validate this interaction. The rs1060120 A allele significantly reduced luciferase expression, indicating a stronger interaction with miR-616 than the G allele (p = 0.000412). These results provide functional validation that this SNP could alter schizophrenia epigenetic mechanisms thereby contributing to schizophrenia-related disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W2793321407,"Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is an emerging biomarker for risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important complication in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this retrospectively observational study, we aimed to determine the role of GDF-15 and the risk of AKI in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.The medical records of 1195 patients with AMI were reviewed. After exclusion criteria, a total of 751 eligible patients who underwent CAG or PCI were studied. Preoperative clinical parameters including GDF-15 levels were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors of AKI. Subsequently, to reduce a potential selection bias and to balance differences between the two groups, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed. We recorded the 30-day all-cause mortality of the total study population. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to identify the association between short term survival in AMI patients and GDF-15 level.Among 751 enrolled patients, 106 patients (14.1%) developed AKI. Patients were divided into two groups: AKI group (n = 106) and non-AKI group (n = 645). GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in AKI group compared to non-AKI group (1328.2 ± 349.7 ng/L vs. 1113.0 ± 371.3 ng/L, P <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed GDF-15 was an independent risk factor of AKI (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.940-7.207, P < 0.001). According to GDF-15 tertiles, patients were divided into three groups. Patients in middle (OR 2.93, 95% CI: 1.46-5.89, P = 0.003) and highest GDF-15 tertile (OR 3.72, 95% CI: 1.87-7.39, P <0.001) had higher risk of AKI compared to patients in the lowest GDF-15 tertile. The propensity score-matched group set comprised of 212 patients. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that GDF-15 is still an independent risk factor for AKI after matching (per 1000 ng/L increase of GDF-15, OR: 2.395, 95% CI: 1.020-5.626, P = 0.045). Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality increased in higher GDF-15 tertiles log rank chi-square: 29.895, P <0.001).This suggests that preoperative plasma GDF-15 is an independent risk factor of AKI in AMI patients underwent CAG or PCI. GDF-15 and AKI are associated with poor short term survival of AMI patients."
https://openalex.org/W2793596731,"Motivated by in vitro time-lapse images of ovarian cancer spheroids inducing mesothelial cell clearance, the traditional agent-based model of cell migration, based on simple volume exclusion, was extended to include the possibility that a cell seeking to move into an occupied location may push the resident cell, and any cells neighbouring it, out of the way to occupy that location. In traditional discrete models of motile cells with volume exclusion such a move would be aborted. We introduce a new shoving mechanism which allows cells to choose the direction to shove cells that expends the least amount of shoving effort (to account for the likely resistance of cells to being pushed). We call this motility rule 'smart shoving'. We examine whether agent-based simulations of different shoving mechanisms can be distinguished on the basis of single realisations and averages over many realisations. We emphasise the difficulty in distinguishing cell mechanisms from cellular automata simulations based on snap-shots of cell distributions, site-occupancy averages and the evolution of the number of cells of each species averaged over many realisations. This difficulty suggests the need for higher resolution cell tracking."
https://openalex.org/W2790465241,"Rapid repair of vascular injury is an important prognostic factor for electrical burns. This repair is achieved mainly via stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α promoting the mobilization, chemotaxis, homing, and targeted differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into endothelial cells. Forming a concentration gradient from the site of local damage in the circulation is essential to the role of SDF-1α. In a previous study, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive PPADT nanoparticles containing SDF-1α that could degrade in response to high concentration of ROS in tissue lesions, achieving the goal of targeted SDF-1α release. In the current study, a rat vascular injury model of electrical burns was used to evaluate the effects of targeted release of SDF-1α using PPADT nanoparticles on the chemotaxis of BMSCs and the repair of vascular injury. Continuous exposure to 220 V for 6 s could damage rat vascular endothelial cells, strip off the inner layer, significantly elevate the local level of ROS, and decrease the level of SDF-1α. After injection of Cy5-labeled SDF-1α-PPADT nanoparticles, the distribution of Cy5 fluorescence suggested that SDF-1α was distributed primarily at the injury site, and the local SDF-1α levels increased significantly. Seven days after injury with nanoparticles injection, aggregation of exogenous green fluorescent protein-labeled BMSCs at the injury site was observed. Ten days after injury, the endothelial cell arrangement was better organized and continuous, with relatively intact vascular morphology and more blood vessels. These results showed that SDF-1α-PPADT nanoparticles targeted the SDF-1α release at the site of injury, directing BMSC chemotaxis and homing, thereby promoting vascular repair in response to electrical burns."
https://openalex.org/W2791670156,"Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning but how ecosystem WUE responds to climate change including precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition increases is still unknown. To investigate such responses, an experiment with a randomized block design with water (spring snowfall or summer water addition) and nitrogen addition was conducted in a temperate steppe of northern China. We investigated net ecosystem CO2 production (NEP), gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) to calculate ecosystem WUE (WUEnep = NEP/ET or WUEgep = GEP/ET) under spring snow and summer water addition with or without N addition from 2011 to 2013. The results showed that spring snow addition only had significant effect on ecosystem WUE in 2013 and summer water addition showed positive effect on ecosystem WUE in 2011 and 2013, as their effects on NEP and GEP is stronger than ET. N addition increased ecosystem WUE in 2012 and 2013 both in spring snow addition and summer water addition for its increasing effects on NEP and GEP but no effect on ET. Summer water addition had less but N addition had greater increasing effects on ecosystem WUE as natural precipitation increase indicating that natural precipitation regulates ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition. Moreover, WUE was tightly related with atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), precipitation and soil moisture indicating the regulation of climate drivers on ecosystem WUE. In addition, it also was affected by aboveground net primary production (ANPP). The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China."

The current study attempts to characterize the genetic structure and fragmentation of the species via the application of genotypic markers. It was revealed that the genetic variety was mainly allocated among the populations collected, since clustering obtained was according to the geographic origin of the samples and the habitat. Species distribution modeling showed that the most important climatic variable defining A. ventricosa distribution is the mean diurnal temperature. Furthermore, significant association of the genetic structure to environmental variables was detected; overall, a negative association to precipitation was confirmed, while significant correlations of genetic structure and the temperature at the time of anthesis and germination were established. The safeguarding of this valuable genetic resource is discussed."

Mannitol oxidase was previously investigated in terrestrial snails and slugs, being also present in a few aquatic gastropods. However, the overall distribution of this enzyme in the Gastropoda was not known. Polyol dehydrogenases are also poorly studied in gastropods and other mollusks. In this study, polyalcohol oxidase and dehydrogenase activities were assayed in the digestive gland of 26 species of gastropods, representing the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. Marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, including herbivores and carnivores were analyzed. Ultrastructural observations were undertake in species possessing mannitol oxidase, in order to investigate the correlation between this enzyme and the presence of tubular structures known to be associated with it. Mannitol oxidase activity was detected in the digestive gland of herbivores from the clades Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia, but not in any carnivores or in herbivores from the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha and Vetigastropoda. In most of the species used in this study, dehydrogenase activities were detected using both D-mannitol and D-sorbitol as substrates. Nevertheless, in some carnivores these activities were not detected with both polyalcohols. Ultrastructural observations revealed tubular structures in digestive gland cells of some species having mannitol oxidase activity, but they were not observed in others. Based on our results, we suggest that mannitol oxidase first occurred in a herbivorous or omnivorous ancestor of Apogastropoda, the clade formed by caenogastropods and heterobranchs, being subsequently lost in those species that shifted towards a carnivorous diet."
https://openalex.org/W2793876735,"Acute stress responsiveness is a quantitative trait that varies in severity from one individual to another; however, the genetic component underlying the individual variation is largely unknown. Fischer 344 (F344) and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat strains show large differences in behavioral responsiveness to acute stress, such as freezing behavior in response to footshock during the conditioning phase of contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for behavioral responsiveness to acute stress in the defensive burying (DB) and open field test (OFT) from a reciprocal F2 cross of F344 and WKY rat strains. These included a significant QTL on chromosome 6 (Stresp10). Here, we hypothesized that the Stresp10 region harbors genes with sequence variation(s) that contribute to differences in multiple behavioral response phenotypes between the F344 and WKY rat strains. To test this hypothesis, first we identified differentially expressed genes within the Stresp10 QTL in the hippocampus, amygdala, and frontal cortex of F344 and WKY male rats using genome-wide microarray analyses. Genes with both expression differences and non-synonymous sequence variations in their coding regions were considered candidate quantitative trait genes (QTGs). As a proof-of-concept, the F344.WKY-Stresp10 congenic strain was generated with the Stresp10 WKY donor region into the F344 recipient strain. This congenic strain showed behavioral phenotypes similar to those of WKYs. Expression patterns of Gpatch11 (G-patch domain containing 11), Cdkl4 (Cyclin dependent kinase like 4), and Drc1 (Dynein regulatory complex subunit 1) paralleled that of WKY in the F344.WKY-Stresp10 strain matching the behavioral profiles of WKY as opposed to F344 parental strains. We propose that these genes are candidate QTGs for behavioral responsiveness to acute stress."

We conducted this study in patients with cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors to assess the effect of RF on aspirin resistance and explore whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) would influence this effect.A total of 177 stable patients with ≥2 CVR factors were recruited. All patients observed RF and were taking aspirin. Physical exam and standard biological tests including glycaemia and serum lipids data were performed before Ramadan (Pre-R), at the last week of Ramadan (R) and four weeks after the end of Ramadan (Post-R). In the same visits caloric intake was calculated and platelet reactivity to aspirin was assessed using Verify Now point-of-care assay.In the overall population, there was no significant change in absolute aspirin reaction unit (ARU) values and in metabolic parameters. In DM patients (n = 127), ARU change from Pre-R values was+19.7 (p = 0.01) and +14.4 (p = 0.02) respectively at R and Post-R. During Ramadan, glycaemia, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels increased significantly and returned to Pre-R values thereafter. These changes were not observed in non-DM patients.During RF aspirin resistance increased only in DM patients. This effect persisted one month after Ramadan. Simultaneous alteration of glycemic control and increase of serum lipids levels could potentially be a favorable factor.The protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov under: NCT02720133."
