Objective Characterize the temporal relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels [25(OH)D3] and intact iPTH for several seasons, by gender and latitude in the U.S. and relate 25-hydrovitamin D2 [25(OH)D2] levels with PTH levels and total 25(OH)D levels. Method We retrospectively determined population weekly-mean concentrations of unpaired [25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3] and iPTH using 3.8 million laboratory results of adults. The 25(OH)D3 and iPTH distributions were normalized and the means fit with a sinusoidal function for both gender and latitudes: North >40, Central 32–40 and South <32 degrees. We analyzed PTH and total 25(OH)D separately in samples with detectable 25(OH)D2 (≥4 ng/mL). Findings Seasonal variation was observed for all genders and latitudes. 25(OH)D3 peaks occurred in September and troughs in March. iPTH levels showed an inverted pattern of peaks and troughs relative to 25(OH)D3, with a delay of 4 weeks. Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was common (33% <20 ng/mL; 60% <30 ng/mL) as was elevated iPTH levels (33%>65 pg/mL). The percentage of patients deficient in 25(OH)D3 seasonally varied from 21% to 48% and the percentage with elevated iPTH reciprocally varied from 28% to 38%. Patients with detectable 25(OH)D2 had higher PTH levels and 57% of the samples with a total 25(OH)D > 50 ng/mL had detectable 25(OH)D2. Interpretation 25(OH)D3 and iPTH levels vary in a sinusoidal pattern throughout the year, even in vitamin D2 treated patients; 25(OH)D3, being higher in the summer and lower in the winter months, with iPTH showing the reverse pattern. A large percentage of the tested population showed vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. These observations held across three latitudinal regions, both genders, multiple-years, and in the presence or absence of detectable 25(OH)D2, and thus are applicable for patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2052820025,"Subjective age, or how young or old individuals experience themselves to be relative to their chronological age, is a crucial construct in gerontology. Subjective age is a significant predictor of important health outcomes, but little is known about the criteria by which individuals' subjectively evaluate their age. To identify psychosocial and biomedical factors linked to the subjective evaluation of age, this study examined whether perceived age discrimination and markers of biological aging are associated with subjective age. Participants were 4776 adults (Mage = 68) from the 2008 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) who completed measures of subjective age, age discrimination, demographic variables, self-rated health and depression, and had physical health measures, including peak expiratory flow, grip strength, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Telomere length was available for a subset of participants in the 2008 wave (n = 2214). Regression analysis indicated that perceived age discrimination, lower peak expiratory flow, lower grip strength, and higher waist circumference were associated with an older subjective age, controlling for sociodemographic factors, self-rated health, and depression. In contrast, blood pressure and telomere length were not related to subjective age. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that how old a person feels depends in part on psychosocial and biomedical factors, including the experiences of ageism and perceptible indices of fitness and biological age."
https://openalex.org/W2030713637,"Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease with a complex neurological phenotype, but the most common cause of death is heart failure. This study presents a systematic analysis of 15 fixed and 13 frozen archival autopsy tissues of FA hearts and 10 normal controls (8 frozen) by measurement of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; tissue frataxin assay; X-ray fluorescence (XRF) of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) in polyethylene glycol-embedded samples of left and right ventricular walls (LVW, RVW) and ventricular septum (VS); metal quantification in bulk digests by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES); Fe histochemistry; and immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence of cytosolic and mitochondrial ferritins and of the inflammatory markers CD68 and hepcidin. FA cardiomyocytes were significantly larger than normal and surrounded by fibrotic endomysium. Frataxin in LVW was reduced to less than 15 ng/g wet weight (normal 235.4±75.1 ng/g). All sections displayed characteristic Fe-reactive inclusions in cardiomyocytes, and XRF confirmed significant regional Fe accumulation in LVW and VS. In contrast, ICP-OES analysis of bulk extracts revealed normal total Fe levels in LVW, RVW, and VS. Cardiac Zn remained normal by XRF and assay of bulk digests. Cytosolic and mitochondrial ferritins exhibited extensive co-localization in cardiomyocytes, representing translational and transcriptional responses to Fe, respectively. Fe accumulation progressed from a few small granules to coarse aggregates in phagocytized cardiomyocytes. All cases met the “Dallas criteria” of myocarditis. Inflammatory cells contained CD68 and cytosolic ferritin, and most also expressed the Fe-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Inflammation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of FA cardiomyopathy but may be more evident in advanced stages of the disease. Hepcidin-induced failure of Fe export from macrophages is a likely contributory cause of damage to the heart in FA. Frataxin replacement and anti-inflammatory agents are potential therapies in FA cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2028534637,"Disability, functionality, and morbidity are often used to describe the health of the elderly. Although particularly important when planning health and social services, knowledge about their distribution and aggregation at different ages is limited. We aim to characterize the variation of health status in a 60+ old population using five indicators of health separately and in combination.3080 adults 60+ living in Sweden between 2001 and 2004 and participating at the SNAC-K population-based cohort study. Health indicators: number of chronic diseases, gait speed, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), disability in instrumental-activities of daily living (I-ADL), and in personal-ADL (P-ADL).Probability of multimorbidity and probability of slow gait speed were already above 60% and 20% among sexagenarians. Median MMSE and median I-ADL showed good performance range until age 84; median P-ADL was close to zero up to age 90. Thirty% of sexagenarians and 11% of septuagenarians had no morbidity and no impairment, 92% and 80% of them had no disability. Twenty-eight% of octogenarians had multimorbidity but only 27% had some I-ADL disability. Among nonagenarians, 13% had severe disability and impaired functioning while 12% had multimorbidity and slow gait speed.Age 80-85 is a transitional period when major health changes take place. Until age 80, most people do not have functional impairment or disability, despite the presence of chronic disorders. Disability becomes common only after age 90. This implies an increasing need of medical care after age 70, whereas social care, including institutionalization, becomes a necessity only in nonagenarians."
https://openalex.org/W1992667426,"Objective Determine whether MS-specific DNA methylation profiles can be identified in whole blood or purified immune cells from untreated MS patients. Methods Whole blood, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell DNA from 16 female, treatment naïve MS patients and 14 matched controls was profiled using the HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. Genotype data were used to assess genetic homogeneity of our sample and to exclude potential SNP-induced DNA methylation measurement errors. Results As expected, significant differences between CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and whole blood DNA methylation profiles were observed, regardless of disease status. Strong evidence for hypermethylation of CD8+ T cell, but not CD4+ T cell or whole blood DNA in MS patients compared to controls was observed. Genome-wide significant individual CpG-site DNA methylation differences were not identified. Furthermore, significant differences in gene DNA methylation of 148 established MS-associated risk genes were not observed. Conclusion While genome-wide significant DNA methylation differences were not detected for individual CpG-sites, strong evidence for DNA hypermethylation of CD8+ T cells for MS patients was observed, indicating a role for DNA methylation in MS. Further, our results suggest that large DNA methylation differences for CpG-sites tested here do not contribute to MS susceptibility. In particular, large DNA methylation differences for CpG-sites within 148 established MS candidate genes tested in our study cannot explain missing heritability. Larger studies of homogenous MS patients and matched controls are warranted to further elucidate the impact of CD8+ T cell and more subtle DNA methylation changes in MS development and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1998738356,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A challenge for HCV vaccine development is to identify conserved epitopes able to elicit protective antibodies against this highly diverse virus. Glycan shielding is a mechanism by which HCV masks such epitopes on its E2 envelope glycoprotein. Antibodies to the E2 region comprising residues 412–423 (E2412–423) have broadly neutralizing activities. However, an adaptive mutation in this linear epitope, N417S, is associated with a glycosylation shift from Asn-417 to Asn-415 that enables HCV to escape neutralization by mAbs such as HCV1 and AP33. By contrast, the human mAb HC33.1 can neutralize virus bearing the N417S mutation. To understand how HC33.1 penetrates the glycan shield created by the glycosylation shift to Asn-415, we determined the structure of this broadly neutralizing mAb in complex with its E2412–423 epitope to 2.0 Å resolution. The conformation of E2412–423 bound to HC33.1 is distinct from the β-hairpin conformation of this peptide bound to HCV1 or AP33, because of disruption of the β-hairpin through interactions with the unusually long complementarity-determining region 3 of the HC33.1 heavy chain. Whereas Asn-415 is buried by HCV1 and AP33, it is solvent-exposed in the HC33.1-E2412–423 complex, such that glycosylation of Asn-415 would not prevent antibody binding. Furthermore, our results highlight the structural flexibility of the E2412–423 epitope, which may serve as an immune evasion strategy to impede induction of antibodies targeting this site by reducing its antigenicity.

The recent introduction of successful HCV-specific direct-acting antiviral agents represents a major advance in HCV therapy (4Schinazi R. Halfon P. Marcellin P. Asselah T. HCV direct-acting antiviral agents: the best interferon-free combinations.Liver Int. 2014; 34: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the high cost of direct-acting antiviral agents precludes their availability to the large majority of HCV-infected individuals living in developing countries. In addition, health care workers with occupational risk for blood-borne pathogens and injection drug users will remain at risk for repeated exposure to HCV, even after successful direct-acting antiviral agents treatment. Thus, there is a compelling need for a preventive HCV vaccine. hepatitis C virus heavy chain variable region light chain variable region complementarity-determining region root mean square distance. The key challenge in HCV vaccine development is to overcome the high diversity of this virus and its potential to escape from host immune responses. HCV is composed of a nucleocapsid core enveloped by a lipid bilayer in which two surface glycoproteins, E1 and E2, are anchored. Entry of HCV into hepatocytes is mediated by interactions between the E1E2 heterodimer and at least four cellular receptors: the tetraspanin CD81 (5Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G.

An effective vaccine must include conserved epitopes of E1E2 that are able to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. Accordingly, much effort has been focused on the identification of conserved regions of E1E2 mediating virus neutralization through the isolation and characterization of mAbs from HCV-infected individuals and experimentally immunized mice (9Angus A.G.

In a particularly revealing recent example, deep sequencing analysis of HCV resistance to neutralization by mAbs HCV1 and AP33 identified mutations at asparagine 417 of E2 (N417S and N417T), an N-glycosylation site within the E2412–423 epitope recognized by these mAbs, as responsible for virus escape (35Pantua H.

Human monoclonal antibody MBL-HCV1 delays HCV viral rebound following liver transplantation: a randomized controlled study.Am. J. Transplant. 2013; 13: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Notably, liver transplantation patients with HCV who were treated with HCV1 showed rebounds in viral load at various times following transplantation (39Chung R.T. Gordon F.D. Curry M.P. Schiano T.D.

These rebounds were consistently associated with mutations in the E2412–423 epitope known to confer resistance to HCV1, in particular N417S. In sharp contrast to mAbs HCV1 and AP33, HC33.1, which was isolated from an HCV-infected blood donor, can neutralize virus bearing the E2 N417S and N417T adaptive mutations with the glycosylation shift to Asn-415 (14Keck Z.

Moreover, infectious HCV virions containing the N417S mutation displayed increased sensitivity to neutralization by HC33.1 and related antibodies (28Keck Z.Y. Angus A.G. Wang W. Lau P. Wang Y.

To understand how HC33.1 is able to penetrate the glycan shield of HCV created by this shift, we determined the crystal structure of this broadly neutralizing human mAb in complex with its E2412–423 epitope. The HC33.1 antibody was expressed as a single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) by in vitro folding from inclusion bodies produced in Escherichia coli. The scFv construct consisted of the heavy chain variable (VH) region (residues Glu-1–Ser-127) connected to the light chain variable (VL) region (residues Gln-1–Leu-110) by an 18-residue linker (GSTGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS). The HC33.1 scFv was cloned into the expression vector pET-26b (Novagen) and expressed as inclusion bodies in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium to an absorbance of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After incubation for 3 h, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl and 2 mm EDTA; cells were disrupted by sonication.

https://openalex.org/W2002853429,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of tumorigenesis. Several miRNAs, which can function either as oncomiRs or tumor suppressive miRs are deregulated in cancer cells. The microRNA-31 (miR-31) has been shown to be overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer. It promotes multiple oncogenic phenotypes, including proliferation, motility, and invasion of cancer cells. Using a breast cancer-related miRNA array analysis, we identified miR-31 as a novel target of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) in breast cancer cells. Specifically, we show that sodium butyrate (NaB) and panobinostat (LBH589), two broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors up-regulate hsa-miR-31 (miR-31). The up-regulation of miR-31 was accompanied by repression of the polycomb group (PcG) protein BMI1 and induction of cellular senescence. We further show that inhibition of miR-31 overcomes the senescence-inducing effect of HDACi, and restores expression of the PcG protein BMI1. Interestingly, BMI1 also acts as a repressor of miR-31 transcription, suggesting a cross-negative feedback loop between the expression of miR-31 and BMI1. Our data suggest that miR-31 is an important physiological target of HDACi, and that it is an important regulator of senescence relevant to cancer. These studies further suggest that manipulation of miR-31 expression can be used to modulate senescence-related pathological conditions such as cancer, and the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2040012545,"Using data obtained from 4004 participants across eight countries (Canada, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Slovakia, Uganda, and the U.S.), the factorial reliability, validity and structural/measurement invariance of a 30-item version of Expressions of Spirituality Inventory (ESI-R) was evaluated. The ESI-R measures a five factor model of spirituality developed through the conjoint factor analysis of several extant measures of spiritual constructs. Exploratory factor analyses of pooled data provided evidence that the five ESI-R factors are reliable. Confirmatory analyses comparing four and five factor models revealed that the five dimensional model demonstrates superior goodness-of-fit with all cultural samples and suggest that the ESI-R may be viewed as structurally invariant. Measurement invariance, however, was not supported as manifested in significant differences in item and dimension scores and in significantly poorer fit when factor loadings were constrained to equality across all samples. Exploratory analyses with a second adjective measure of spirituality using American, Indian, and Ugandan samples identified three replicable factors which correlated with ESI-R dimensions in a manner supportive of convergent validity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the meaning of the findings and directions needed for future research."
https://openalex.org/W1975868175,"KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates have emerged as important pathogens of nosocomial infections, and tigecycline is one of the antibiotics recommended for severe infections caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. To identify the susceptibility profile of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae to tigecycline and investigate the role of efflux pumps in tigecycline resistance, a total of 215 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates were collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of tigecycline was determined by standard broth microdilution tests. Isolates showing resistance to tigecycline underwent susceptibility test with efflux pump inhibitors. Expression levels of efflux pump genes (acrB and oqxB) and their regulators (ramA, marA, soxS and rarA) were examined by real-time PCR, and the correlation between tigecycline MICs and gene expression levels were analysed. Our results show that the tigecycline resistance rate in these isolates was 11.2%. Exposure of the tigecycline-resistant isolates to the efflux pump inhibitor NMP resulted in an obvious decrease in MICs and restored susceptibility to tigecycline in 91.7% of the isolates. A statistically significant association between acrB expression and tigecycline MICs was observed, and overexpression of ramA was found in three tigecycline-resistant isolates, further analysis confirmed ramR mutations existed in these isolates. Transformation of one mutant with wild-type ramR restored susceptibility to tigecycline and repressed overexpression of ramA and acrB. These data indicate that efflux pump AcrAB, which can be up-regulated by ramR mutations and subsequent ramA activation, contributed to tigecycline resistance in K. pneumoniae clinical isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2058203444,"Assembly and maturation of the apical extracellular matrix (aECM) is crucial for protecting organisms, but underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Epidermal cells secrete proteins and enzymes that assemble at the apical cell surface to provide epithelial integrity and stability during developmental growth and upon tissue damage. We analyzed molecular mechanisms of aECM assembly and identified the conserved chitin-binding protein Obst-A (Obstructor A) as an essential regulator. We show in Drosophila that Obst-A is required to coordinate protein and chitin matrix packaging at the apical cell surface during development. Secreted by epidermal cells, the Obst-A protein is specifically enriched in the apical assembly zone where matrix components are packaged into their highly ordered architecture. In obst-A null mutant larvae, the assembly zone is strongly diminished, resulting in severe disturbance of matrix scaffold organization and impaired aECM integrity. Furthermore, enzymes that support aECM stability are mislocalized. As a biological consequence, cuticle architecture, integrity, and function are disturbed in obst-A mutants, finally resulting in immediate lethality upon wounding.

The insect aECM provides an exoskeletal cuticle that is in contact with the surrounding environment for protection against lethal infections and other environmental stresses.

To distinguish mutants from others, balancer chromosomes were used: FM7i,P{ActinGFP} or TM3,P{GAL4twi.G}2,3P {UAS-2xEGFP} or TM3serP{w[+m]hsp70:GAL4}P{w[+m]UAS:GFP}. The absence of GFP expression was used as a marker to identify larvae carrying hemizygous and homozygous mutant alleles. Transheterozygous mutants were generated by mating of obst-A/FM7i,P {ActinGFP} heterozygous females with either serp,verm/TM3,P {GAL4twi.G} 2,3P {UAS-2xEGFP} or knk/TM3serP{w[+m]hsp70:GAL4}P{w[+m]UAS:GFP} heterozygous males. The non-GFP offspring of first instar larvae, collected and tested for cuticle integrity, include 50% of obst-A hemizygous and 50% of transheterozygous mutants. Because of early larval lethality of obst-A hemizygous null mutants, analyzed non-GFP offspring collection for immunofluorescent stainings at second and third instar larvae only contained transheterozygous mutants. Crosses of 69BGal4 driver flies and UAS-RNAi-knk, -serp, and -verm flies, respectively, result in RNAi-mediated knockdown in the offspring epidermis. Larvae were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, dehydrated, and embedded in JB-4 Plus (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Polymerized blocks were cut in 7-μm sections (Ultracut E; Reichert-Jung, Solms, Germany). Sections were rehydrated and subjected to an antigen retrieval protocol in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0, at 65 °C depending on the primary antibody for 15 min (α-Obst-A and α-Knk) or 1 h (α-Serp, α-Verm) and incubated with 0.001% trypsin in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 1 h. Sections were blocked in PBS + 10% donkey serum for 30 min and stained overnight at 4 °C with Alexa 488-conjugated chitin-binding probe (Cbp; 1:100; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), which selectively binds chitin. The Alexa 633-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; 1:250; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) is a lectin, which is able to react with internal sugar residues of glycoproteins and selectively recognizes N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. WGA has a very strong affinity to chitin and was used to label the apical cell surfaces in Drosophila embryos and larvae (19Petkau G. Wingen C. Jussen L.C. Radtke T. Behr M.

Primary antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies linked with fluorescent dyes (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For Z-stack analysis sequential scans were taken with Zeiss LSM710/LSM780 microscopes (Carl Zeiss) and a 63× LCI Plan Neofluar objective. The pinhole was adjusted to “airy unit 1,” and standard settings were used. Images were cropped in ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop CS6, and figures were designed with Adobe Illustrator CS6. Larvae were placed on a 150-μm flat embedding specimen holder (Engineering Office Wohlwend, Sennwald, Switzerland) and frozen in a Leica HBM 100 high pressure freezer (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). An automatic freeze substitution unit (Leica) was used for embedding of the vitrified samples. Substitution was performed at −90 °C in a solution containing anhydrous acetone, 0.1% tannic acid, and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 72 h and in anhydrous acetone, 2% OsO4, 0.5% glutaraldehyde for additional 8 h. After 18 h of incubation at −20 °C, warmed (4 °C) samples were washed with anhydrous acetone and embedded in Agar 100 (Epon 812 equivalent). Images were taken with a Philips CM120 electron microscope (Philips Inc.; TemCam 224A slow scan CCD camera; TVIPS, Gauting, Germany). Indirect detection of chitin was carried out on Epon-embedded samples as previously described by Moussian et al. (25Moussian B. Veerkamp J. Müller U. Schwarz H.

WGA labels colloidal gold, an electron dense marker used to study chitin localization in ultrastructure analysis (26Peters W. Latka I. Electron microscopic localization of chitin using colloidal gold labelled with wheat germ agglutinin.Histochemistry. 1986; 84: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). WGA (5 μg/ml; Vector Laboratories) was detected by a rabbit-anti-biotin antibody (3.9 μg/ml; Rockland, Gibbertsville, PA) and protein A gold (10 nm, 1:100, G. Posthuma, Utrecht, The Netherlands). As negative control immunogold labeling without WGA was performed, as well as without primary antibody. These negative controls showed no significant unspecific labeling (data not shown). We performed Obst-A immunogold labeling on ultrathin sections of HM20-embedded samples as follows. The high pressure frozen larvae were substituted using the Leica automatic freeze substitution unit for 57 h at −90 °C in 1% uranyl acetate in acetone. After further incubations at −60 and −25 °C, the samples were infiltrated with HM20 resin (Polysciences) and polymerized using UV light at −45 °C for 48 h. Immunogold labeling of Obst-A was performed using 1:100 diluted Obst-A antibody and protein A gold (10 nm, 1:50). For better visibility of the gold labeling, pictures were taken of not counterstained sections using a Philips CM120 electron microscope (Philips Inc.; TemCam F416 CMOS camera; TVIPS). Cuticle integrity was tested with a thin glass needle. Mid-first instar larvae were laterally pricked at the posterior part, and hemolymph bleeding was monitored. Organ spill out after injury was considered as a defect in cuticle integrity. For the survival assay, 100 stage 17 embryos of each genotype were placed alive on apple juice agar plates with yeast (25 embryos/plate). The number of surviving animals was counted throughout larval and pupal development until the hatching of adult flies. To determine overall body size, body circumference in cross-sections of first instar wild type and obst-A mutant larvae was measured (in pixels) with ImageJ. The average radius of the sections was determined (in pixels) for calculation of the ideal circumference (2πr). The actual circumference was compared with the ideal circumference, and the discrepancy was statistically analyzed. Calculations were performed for 5 larvae/genotype. For all experiments, significance was calculated using a t test (Microsoft Excel), and p values are represented by asterisks: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001. The error bars show S.E. for the integrity test and standard error for the survival assay. obst-A mutant first instar larvae and wild type larvae from different developmental time points were grown at 25 °C, collected, and homogenized in a Precellys homogenizator. RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), and cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with a CFX96 cycler (Bio-Rad). For normalization, transcript levels of rp49 (ribosomal protein L32) were used. qRT-PCRs were carried out of at least five individual biological replicates. Standard control PCRs (no template control; negative control) were used to rule out contaminations. In addition, primer efficiency (above 95%), as well as potential dimer formation, was evaluated. As a control obst-A null mutant larvae did not show obst-A expression (data not shown), which is consistent with previous findings (19Petkau G. Wingen C. Jussen L.C. Radtke T. Behr M. Obstructor-A is required for epithelial extracellular matrix dynamics, exoskeleton function, and tubulogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21396-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Significance was tested using one-way analysis of variance (GraphPad Prism 6), and p values are indicated by asterisks (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; and ***, p < 0.001). The error bars show the S.E. The following primers were used for qRT-PCR analysis: obst-A-for, GCAGTGCGACAAGTTCTACG; obst-A-rev, GAACTTGCGGTTGAG-TGGAT; serp-for, CAAGGCCACCTACTTCGTGT; serp-rev, ACTGCGATCTCGTGTCCTTT; verm-for, GTGGCTGAAGTCGAAGAAGG; verm-rev, TTGGTCACGAAGAACACGTC; knk-for, GGGGCGGATACGTTTTTCTG; knk-rev, TCCAGAATGTTGGTTTTGCCAT; ribosomal protein L32 (rp49)-for, GCTAAGCTGTCGCACAAATG; and rp49-rev, GTTCGATCCGTAACCGATGT. The chitin matrix is the main part of the cuticle that is essential for epidermal stability. Barrier integrity is required for survival and shaping of organisms and organs throughout development. Therefore, a number of scaffold proteins and enzymes coordinate chitin matrix assembly, maturation, and degradation at the apical surface of epidermal cells. The Obst-A chitin-binding protein is fundamental for the barrier function of embryonic and larval exoskeletal cuticles. Severe molting defects and lethality at transition to second instar stage in null mutant larvae suggested that Obst-A plays an essential role in cuticle matrix formation (19Petkau G. Wingen C. Jussen L.C. Radtke T. Behr M. Obstructor-A is required for epithelial extracellular matrix dynamics, exoskeleton function, and tubulogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21396-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that endogenous Obst-A binds chitin (19Petkau G. Wingen C. Jussen L.C. Radtke T. Behr M. Obstructor-A is required for epithelial extracellular matrix dynamics, exoskeleton function, and tubulogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 21396-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Obst-A protein sequence analysis predicted three subsequent type 2 chitin-binding domains (15Behr M. Hoch M. Identification of the novel evolutionary conserved obstructor multigene family in invertebrates.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6827-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The stereotypic pattern of the three Obst-A chitin-binding domains suggested a function in chitin assembly in epithelial organs that require tight and strong cuticles (15Behr M. Hoch M. Identification of the novel evolutionary conserved obstructor multigene family in invertebrates.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6827-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Obst-A is involved in modulating the epidermal chitin matrix structure. This was addressed by analyzing the overall shape and the ultrastructure of late first instar larval cuticle. The wild type chitin matrix, specifically marked by the Cbp, was evenly formed at the epidermal apical cell surface. Cross-sections revealed in 97% of late first instar wild type larvae (n = 27) that epidermis and attached cuticle straightly lined a rounded body (Fig. 1A). In contrast, 54% of late first instar obst-A mutant larvae (n = 24) showed an extremely wrinkled and massively deformed body shape in cross-sections (Fig. 1A). This phenotype is new and unique among known chitin regulators. In addition, nearly one-third (29%) of the larvae revealed cuticle detachment from epidermal cells (Fig. 1B), whereas wild type was normal. To study body shape, the relationship between wrinkled cuticle appearance and body size was investigated in wild type and obst-A mutants (each n = 5). We measured the actual circumference of first instar cross-sections and the average radius for calculating the ideal circumference. In wild type larvae, the actual cuticle circumference was increased by 9% compared with the ideal circumference because of only a few protrusions and notches. In obst-A mutant larvae, the size of the buckling cuticle was significantly increased (*, p < 0.05), with a discrepancy with the ideal circumference of 48%. These findings show that normal body appearance depends on Obst-A function during larval development. The well defined epidermal cuticle morphology can be visualized in ultrastructure analysis and comprises the outermost envelope, the epicuticle, and the inner chitin-rich procuticle. During larval growth, the procuticle develops a highly organized architecture of condensed chitin fibrils which form an increasing number of regularly stratified chitin lamellae observed in second instar larvae (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the epidermis contains a distinct and less electron condensed layer between the apical cell surface and the chitin-rich procuticle (Fig. 2A). This defined layer has been previously described as the assembly zone (27Wolfgang W.J. Fristrom D. Fristrom J.W. An assembly zone antigen of the insect cuticle.Tissue Cell. 1987; 19: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which is synonymous to adhesion zone (28Bökel C. Prokop A. Brown N.H. Papillotte and Piopio: Drosophila ZP-domain proteins are required for cell adhesion to the apical extracellular matrix and microtubule organization.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and the deposition zone (14Kaznowski C.E. Schneiderman H.A. Bryant P.J. Cuticle secretion during larval growth in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Insect Physiol. 1985; 31: 801-813Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the process of cuticle formation, the assembly zone is a stable and permeable matrix, passed by newly synthesized chitin components, but its function in cuticle formation is not yet understood (14Kaznowski C.E. Schneiderman H.A. Bryant P.J. Cuticle secretion during larval growth in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Insect Physiol. 1985; 31: 801-813Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Wolfgang W.J. Fristrom D.

Papillotte and Piopio: Drosophila ZP-domain proteins are required for cell adhesion to the apical extracellular matrix and microtubule organization.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type, the less electron condensed assembly zone was not detectable in obst-A mutant larvae. Instead, the procuticle-like structure filled the entire region between epicuticle and epidermal cell surface (Fig. 2A). To further distinguish the procuticle from the assembly zone, we performed immunogold labeling using WGA, which possesses a strong affinity to oligomers and polymers of N-acetylglucosamine (26Peters W. Latka I. Electron microscopic localization of chitin using colloidal gold labelled with wheat germ agglutinin.Histochemistry. 1986; 84: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

Using automatic extraction of people names, we obtain the top 100 historical figures, for each edition and for each algorithm. We investigate their spatial, temporal, and gender distributions in dependence of their cultural origins. Our study demonstrates not only the existence of skewness with local figures, mainly recognized only in their own cultures, but also the existence of global historical figures appearing in a large number of editions. By determining the birth time and place of these persons, we perform an analysis of the evolution of such figures through 35 centuries of human history for each language, thus recovering interactions and entanglement of cultures over time. We also obtain the distributions of historical figures over world countries, highlighting geographical aspects of cross-cultural links. Considering historical figures who appear in multiple editions as interactions between cultures, we construct a network of cultures and identify the most influential cultures according to this network."

All participants were provided written informed consent. Resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance images were acquired for all participants. The rsFC between bilateral homotopic voxels was calculated. Regions showing abnormal VMHC in IGD participants were adopted as regions of interest for correlation analyses.Compared to healthy controls, IGD participants showed decreased VMHC between the left and right superior frontal gyrus (orbital part), inferior frontal gyrus (orbital part), middle frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. Further analyses showed Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS)-related VMHC in superior frontal gyrus (orbital part) and CIAS (r = -0.55, p = 0.02, uncorrected).Our findings implicate the important role of altered interhemispheric rsFC in the bilateral prefrontal lobe in the neuropathological mechanism of IGD, and provide further supportive evidence for the reclassification of IGD as a behavioral addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2015100090,"Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors including glioblastoma (GBM). Its synergism with Notch signaling promotes progression in different cancers. However, Notch signaling exhibits pleiotropic roles and the existing literature lacks a comprehensive understanding of its perturbations under hypoxia in GBM with respect to all components of the pathway. We identified the key molecular cluster(s) characteristic of the Notch pathway response in hypoxic GBM tumors and gliomaspheres. Expression of Notch and hypoxia genes was evaluated in primary human GBM tissues by q-PCR. Clustering and statistical analyses were applied to identify the combination of hypoxia markers correlated with upregulated Notch pathway components. We found well-segregated tumor—clusters representing high and low HIF-1α/PGK1-expressors which accounted for differential expression of Notch signaling genes. In combination, a five-hypoxia marker set (HIF-1α/PGK1/VEGF/CA9/OPN) was determined as the best predictor for induction of Notch1/Dll1/Hes1/Hes6/Hey1/Hey2. Similar Notch-axis genes were activated in gliomaspheres, but not monolayer cultures, under moderate/severe hypoxia (2%/0.2% O2). Preliminary evidence suggested inverse correlation between patient survival and increased expression of constituents of the hypoxia-Notch gene signature. Together, our findings delineated the Notch-axis maximally associated with hypoxia in resected GBM, which might be prognostically relevant. Its upregulation in hypoxia-exposed gliomaspheres signify them as a better in-vitro model for studying hypoxia-Notch interactions than monolayer cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2022572376,"CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are known to be very potent suppressors of T cell immunity and can be further stratified into granulocytic MDSC and monocytic MDSC in mice based on expression of Ly6G or Ly6C, respectively.

In an adenine-induced model of kidney inflammation/fibrosis suppressive Ly6Gpos MDSC were induced. The suppressive function within the Ly6G+ MDSC population was exclusively present in IFNγRβ expressing cells. In contrast, in chronic inflammation in the liver induced by bile duct ligation, suppressive capacity was exclusively present in the Ly6Cpos MDSC subset. Gene expression analyses confirmed the differential origins and regulation of those MDSC subsets. Additionally, depletion of MDSC in either kidney or liver fibrosis enhanced fibrosis markers, indicating a protective role for MDSC in organ fibrosis. Thus, our data demonstrate that during liver inflammation and kidney fibrosis MDSC with similar function arise bearing a distinct marker profile and arising from different cell populations."

We investigated miR-486 expression in cow mammary gland using qRT-PCR and ISH and show that miR-486 expression was higher during the high-quality lactation period. We found that miR-486 targets phosphoinositide signaling in the cow mammary gland by directly downregulating PTEN gene expression and by altering the expression of downstream genes that are important for the function of the mammary gland, such as AKT, mTOR. We analyzed the effect of β-casein, lactose and triglyceride secretion in bovine mammary gland epithelial cells (BMECs) transfected by an inhibitor and by mimics of miR-486. Our results identify miR-486 as a downstream regulator of PTEN that is required for the development of the cow mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1979170977,"We previously reported that Astragaloside IV (ASIV), a major active constituent of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch) Bge protects against cardiac hypertrophy in rats induced by isoproterenol (Iso), however the mechanism underlying the protection remains unknown. Dysfunction of cardiac energy biosynthesis contributes to the hypertrophy and Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB)/Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ Coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling gets involved in the dysfunction. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanism by which ASIV improves the cardiac hypertrophy with focuses on the NF-κB/PGC-1α signaling mediated energy biosynthesis. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats or Neonatal Rat Ventricular Myocytes (NRVMs) were treated with Iso alone or in combination with ASIV. The results showed that combination with ASIV significantly attenuated the pathological changes, reduced the ratios of heart weight/body weight and Left ventricular weight/body weight, improved the cardiac hemodynamics, down-regulated mRNA expression of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), increased the ratio of ATP/AMP, and decreased the content of Free Fat Acid (FFA) in heart tissue of rats compared with Iso alone. In addition, pretreatment with ASIV significantly decreased the surface area and protein content, down-regulated mRNA expression of ANP and BNP, increased the ratio of ATP/AMP, and decreased the content of FFA in NRVMs compared with Iso alone. Furthermore, ASIV increased the protein expression of ATP5D, subunit of ATP synthase and PGC-1α, inhibited translocation of p65, subunit of NF-κB into nuclear fraction in both rats and NRVMs compared with Iso alone. Parthenolide (Par), the specific inhibitor of p65, exerted similar effects as ASIV in NRVMs. Knockdown of p65 with siRNA decreased the surface areas and increased PGC-1α expression of NRVMs compared with Iso alone. The results suggested that ASIV protects against Iso-induced cardiac hypertrophy through regulating NF-κB/PGC-1α signaling mediated energy biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2067406801,"The correlation between diet and dental topography is of importance to paleontologists seeking to diagnose ecological adaptations in extinct taxa. Although the subject is well represented in the literature, few studies directly compare methods or evaluate dietary signals conveyed by both upper and lower molars. Here, we address this gap in our knowledge by comparing the efficacy of three measures of functional morphology for classifying an ecologically diverse sample of thirteen medium- to large-bodied platyrrhines by diet category (e.g., folivore, frugivore, hard object feeder). We used Shearing Quotient (SQ), an index derived from linear measurements of molar cutting edges and two indices of crown surface topography, Occlusal Relief (OR) and Relief Index (RFI). Using SQ, OR, and RFI, individuals were then classified by dietary category using Discriminate Function Analysis. Both upper and lower molar variables produce high classification rates in assigning individuals to diet categories, but lower molars are consistently more successful. SQs yield the highest classification rates. RFI and OR generally perform above chance. Upper molar RFI has a success rate below the level of chance. Adding molar length enhances the discriminatory power for all variables. We conclude that upper molar SQs are useful for dietary reconstruction, especially when combined with body size information. Additionally, we find that among our sample of platyrrhines, SQ remains the strongest predictor of diet, while RFI is less useful at signaling dietary differences in absence of body size information. The study demonstrates new ways for inferring the diets of extinct platyrrhine primates when both upper and lower molars are available, or, for taxa known only from upper molars. The techniques are useful in reconstructing diet in stem representatives of anthropoid clade, who share key aspects of molar morphology with extant platyrrhines."

We then spatiotemporally calculate the carbon values of the mangrove forests and estimate the amount of carbon lost due to direct displacement by aquaculture. Additionally, we calculate the new carbon stocks generated due to mangrove reforestation or afforestation. This research introduces time and LUCC (land use / land cover change) into the tropical forest carbon literature and examines forest carbon loss at a higher spatiotemporal resolution than in many earlier analyses. We find that 80 percent, or 7,014,517 t of the living carbon lost in Ecuadorian mangrove forests can be attributed to direct displacement of mangrove forests by shrimp aquaculture. We also find that IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) compliant carbon grids within Ecuador's estuaries overestimate living carbon levels in estuaries where substantial LUCC has occurred. By approaching the mangrove forest carbon loss question from a LUCC perspective, these findings allow for tropical nations and other intervention agents to prioritize and target a limited set of land transitions that likely drive the majority of carbon losses. This singular cause of transition has implications for programs that attempt to offset or limit future forest carbon losses and place value on forest carbon or other forest good and services."
https://openalex.org/W2075157239,"Objective Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is an important contributor to the development of back pain, and a key factor relating pain and degeneration are the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IVD motion. There is surprisingly limited understanding of how mechanics and inflammation interact in the IVD. This study investigated interactions between mechanical loading and pro-inflammatory cytokines in a large animal organ culture model to address fundamental questions regarding (i.) how inflammatory mediators arise within the IVD, (ii.) how long inflammatory mediators persist, and (iii.) how inflammatory mediators influence IVD biomechanics. Methods Bovine caudal IVDs were cultured for 6 or 20-days under static &amp; dynamic loading with or without exogenous TNFα in the culture medium, simulating a consequence of inflammation of the surrounding spinal tissues. TNFα transport within the IVD was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Changes in IVD structural integrity (dimensions, histology &amp; aggrecan degradation), biomechanical behavior (Creep, Recovery &amp; Dynamic stiffness) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the culture medium (ELISA) were assessed. Results TNFα was able to penetrate intact IVDs when subjected to dynamic loading but not static loading. Once transported within the IVD, pro-inflammatory mediators persisted for 4–8 days after TNFα removal. TNFα exposure induced changes in IVD biomechanics (reduced diurnal displacements &amp; increased dynamic stiffness). Discussion This study demonstrated that exposure to TNFα, as might occur from injured surrounding tissues, can penetrate healthy intact IVDs, induce expression of additional pro-inflammatory cytokines and alter IVD mechanical behavior. We conclude that exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokine may be an initiating event in the progression of IVD degeneration in addition to being a consequence of disease."

This study aimed to describe the nature and magnitude of risky sexual behaviors, and the socio-demographic and behavioral determinants among female youths in Tiss Abay, a semi-urban area on the outskirts of Bahir Dar City of the Amhara Region in northern Ethiopia.A cross-sectional census type study was conducted among female youths who were unmarried and aged 15-29 years in September 2011.711 female youths participated in the study, with the mean age of initiation of sex of 78.6% being16.73±2.53 years. Only 52(9.3%) used condom during the first sex. Within the last 12 months, 509(71.6%) had sexual intercourse and 278(54.6%) had two or more sex partners, and 316(62.1%) did not use condom during their last sex. Sex under the influence of substances was reported by 350(68.8%), and a third of the recent sexes were against the will of participants. One or more risky sexual practices were reported by 503(70.3%) participants, including: multiple sexual partnerships, inconsistently using or not using condoms, sex under the influence of alcohol and/or sex immediately after watching pornography. Age group, current marital status, drinking homemade alcohol, chewing 'khat', watching pornography and using any form of stimulant substances were the predictors of risky sexual behavior. Watching pornography before sex and sex for transaction were the predicators of not using condom during most recent sex.Risky sexual behaviors were very common among the female youths in Tiss Abay. Initiation of context-based interventions, such as raising awareness about the risks, safer sex practices, condom promotion and integration of gender issues in the programs are recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2031284719,"Objectives Although cannabis use is common in bipolar disorder and may contribute to worse clinical outcomes, little is understood about the relationship between this drug and bipolar disorder over the course of daily life. The aim of study was to examine the effect of cannabis on affect and bipolar symptoms in a group of individuals with bipolar disorder. Methods Twenty-four participants with bipolar disorder type I or type II completed diaries for 6 days using Experience Sampling Methodology to investigate the temporal associations between cannabis, affect and bipolar disorder symptoms. Results The results indicated that higher levels of positive affect increase the odds of using cannabis (OR:1.25 ,CI:1.06–1.47, P=0.008). However, neither negative affect, manic nor depressive symptoms predicted the use of cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in positive affect (β=0.35, CI:0.20-0.51, P=0.000), manic symptoms (β=0.20,CI:0.05-0.34, P=0.009) and depressive symptoms (β= 0.17,CI:0.04-0.29, P=0.008). Conclusion The findings indicate that cannabis use is associated with a number of subsequent psychological effects. However there was no evidence that individuals with BD were using cannabis to self-medicate minor fluctuations in negative affect or bipolar disorder symptoms over the course of daily life. The findings in relation to existing literature and clinical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2335780138,"Protein O-mannosylation is a glycan modification that is required for normal nervous system development and function. Mutations in genes involved in protein O-mannosyl glycosylation give rise to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders known as congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) with associated CNS abnormalities. Our previous work demonstrated that receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (RPTPζ)/phosphacan is hypoglycosylated in a mouse model of one of these CMDs, known as muscle-eye-brain disease, a disorder that is caused by loss of an enzyme (protein O-mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1) that modifies O-mannosyl glycans. In addition, monoclonal antibodies Cat-315 and 3F8 were demonstrated to detect O-mannosyl glycan modifications on RPTPζ/phosphacan. Here, we show that O-mannosyl glycan epitopes recognized by these antibodies define biochemically distinct glycoforms of RPTPζ/phosphacan and that these glycoforms differentially decorate the surface of distinct populations of neural cells. To provide a further structural basis for immunochemically based glycoform differences, we characterized the O-linked glycan heterogeneity of RPTPζ/phosphacan in the early postnatal mouse brain by multidimensional mass spectrometry. Structural characterization of the O-linked glycans released from purified RPTPζ/phosphacan demonstrated that this protein is a significant substrate for protein O-mannosylation and led to the identification of several novel O-mannose-linked glycan structures, including sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine containing modifications. Taken together, our results suggest that specific glycan modifications may tailor the function of this protein to the unique needs of specific cells. Furthermore, their absence in CMDs suggests that hypoglycosylation of RPTPζ/phosphacan may have different functional consequences in neurons and glia.

Protein glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification of cell surface and secreted proteins in organisms ranging from archaea to mammals. For the most part, glycans are added to proteins at Asn residues (N-linked) or at Ser/Thr residues (O-linked), although other linkages have been described (for a review, see Ref. 1Moremen K.W. Tiemeyer M. Nairn A.V. Vertebrate protein glycosylation: diversity, synthesis and function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 448-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Among the O-linked class of glycoprotein glycans in vertebrates, the monosaccharide composition defines the biosynthetic pathways responsible for their production: mucin-type, O-Fuc, O-Glc, O-GlcNAc, glycosaminoglycans, and O-Man. Although originally thought to only occur in fungi, it is now appreciated that protein O-mannosylation is evolutionarily conserved, occurring in insects, fish, and mammals, among other species (for a review, see Ref. 2Lommel M. Strahl S. Protein O-mannosylation: conserved from bacteria to humans.Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

In contrast, the precise functions of the O-mannosylated forms of RPTPζ/phosphacan have been difficult to determine using animal models that lack O-mannosylation because the concomitant aberrant glycosylation of α-DG drives dominant neurological phenotypes. Additionally, our previous biochemical and immunochemical characterization of RPTPζ/phosphacan glycosylation indicated that the protein is decorated with an array of distinct O-mannosyl-dependent epitopes that we hypothesize may individually and uniquely affect function (14Dwyer C.A. Baker E. Hu H. Matthews R.T. RPTPζ/phosphacan is abnormally glycosylated in a model of muscle-eye-brain disease lacking functional POMGnT1.Neuroscience. 2012; 220: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that distinct O-mannosyl glycoforms of RPTPζ/phosphacan are expressed in a cell-specific manner, in that glial cells express different glycoforms than neurons. Further analysis by immunoprecipitation demonstrates that the cell-specific glycoforms are biochemically distinct variants of RPTPζ/phosphacan. Finally to comprehensively define the O-mannosyl glycome of RPTPζ/phosphacan, we performed in depth glycan structural analysis. Our results show that this protein is modified by a heterogeneous array of O-mannosyl glycan structures, including sulfated forms. Our data demonstrate the cell specificity of O-mannosyl glycosylation in the brain and provide a new perspective on historical studies that characterized the function and ligands of RPTPζ/phosphacan.

The rabbit polyclonal anti-RPTPζ/phosphacan core antibody was made against amino acids 25–47 in the N-terminal domain, peptide sequence YYRQQRKLVEEIGWSYTGALNQKC, and affinity-purified and tested for its specificity (YenZym Antibodies, LLC, South San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal anti-neurocan was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Polyclonal anti-brevican and monoclonal anti-HNK-1 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphacan 5210 (clone 122.2) and rabbit polyclonal anti-NG2 were purchased from Chemicon, EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-βIII-tubulin (TuJ1) was purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Mixed primary cortical cultures were prepared essentially as described previously (40Giamanco K.A. Morawski M. Matthews R.T. Perineuronal net formation and structure in aggrecan knockout mice.Neuroscience. 2010; 170: 1314-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortices from embryonic day 16 CD-1 wild type or POMGnT1 embryos were removed and digested in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Cells were plated in Neurobasal Medium containing 3% B27, 1× Glutamax, and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) on glass coverslips coated with 50 μg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). For arabinofuranosyl cytidine (AraC) treatment, 5 μm AraC (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 1 day in vitro (DIV) and removed with a full medium change at 3 DIV. All cells received either a half or full medium change at 3 DIV. Cells were rinsed in 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by submersion into −20 °C methanol for 2 min. Cells were then washed with 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.6 units/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH) (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS for 4 h at 37 °C to enhance 3F8 immunoreactivity. Cells were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk diluted in 1× PBST with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 45 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× PBST and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used, and nuclei were visualized with Hoechst stain. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with the ProLong anti-fade kit (Life Technologies) and imaged on an epifluorescent Zeiss Imager.A2 with Nikon Elements software package. Final images were formatted and compiled into figures using Photoshop CS5.5. For staining with the Cat-315 antibody, postnatal day 0 (P0) mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde. Whole brains were postfixed for 1 h in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected by sinking in 30% phosphate-buffered sucrose. 14-μm coronal sections were cut using a cryostat and mounted and stained directly on glass slides. Tissue sections were blocked and stained in screening medium (DMEM, 5% FBS, 0.2% sodium azide, 1.0% Triton X-100). Mouse monoclonal anti-βIII-tubulin (TuJ1) was used as a neuronal marker. Sequential staining was performed with TuJ1, followed by Cat-315 and Ig subclass-specific secondary antibodies. For staining with the 3F8 antibody, P0 mouse brains were removed, embedded in O.C.T, and flash-frozen in isopentane on dry ice. Coronal sections were prepared as above. Tissue sections were fixed for 10 min in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and then blocked and stained in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× PBST with 1.0% Triton X-100. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NG2 was used to stain oligodendrocytes. In all cases, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst and imaged as described above. Tissue homogenates with respective soluble and particulate fractions were prepared as described previously (41Viapiano M.S. Matthews R.T. Hockfield S.

For O-linked glycan analysis, whole brains from P4 wild type CD1 mice were homogenized in 3 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.32 m sucrose and a protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free Complete, Roche Applied Science). For biochemical studies, whole brains from wild type or POMGnT1 knock-out P4 mice were similarly homogenized in 10 volumes. The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 950 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The postmembrane supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain final soluble and particular fractions. Soluble fraction from wild type P4 mouse brain was diluted to 2.0 mg/ml in 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor tablet, mini, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science). Deglycosylation was performed by incubating samples for 2 h at 37 °C with 150 units/ml BTH (which also removes CS-GAG chains) (Sigma-Aldrich). Ten volumes of Cat-315 hybridoma medium was incubated with goat anti-mouse IgM-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C overnight. Similarly, 3F8 was diluted 1:30 in PBS and incubated with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX) at 4 °C overnight. For immunoprecipitation, samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitor tablet, mini, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science), and 500 μg was used in each reaction. Protein samples and antibody/bead mixture were incubated overnight, rotating at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, followed by two washes in PBS and boiled under reducing conditions in 2× sample buffer. Starting material and immunoprecipitated material were electrophoresed on 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for blotting as described below. To directly compare immunoprecipitated samples, we controlled for the amount of RPTPζ/phosphacan electrophoresed by loading amounts of immunoprecipitated material that yielded similar levels of immunoreactivity for an antibody against the protein core of RPTPζ/phosphacan (generated as described above). Membranes were then stripped and reprobed with antibodies against O-mannosyl carbohydrate epitopes on RPTPζ/phosphacan. Prior to electrophoresis, protein concentrations were determined by a BCA assay. Samples were treated with BTH to remove CS-GAG chains prior to SDS-PAGE. Samples were diluted in 1× BTH buffer (40 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 25 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with 1 mg/ml BTH for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were then reduced and denatured. SDS-polyacrylamide gels (5, 7, or 4–12%) were used (gradient gels only were purchased from Bio-Rad). Stains-all staining for the visualization of acidic proteins was completed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to a published protocol (42Goldberg H.A. Warner K.J.

https://openalex.org/W2006277452,"Our goal is to study the correlations among gray-scale seven-joint ultrasound score (GS-US7), power Doppler seven-joint ultrasound score (PD-US7), disease activity score-28 joints (DAS28), simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI) in patients with and without fibromyalgia (FM).A matched case-control study included all patients consecutively seen in the Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Clinic. Participants were allocated into one of two groups: RA with FM and RA without FM. Ultrasound (US) and clinical scoring were blinded for the presence of FM. Medians and proportions were compared by Mann-Whitney's test and McNemar's test, respectively. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rs) were calculated among clinical and US scores and differences were tested by r-to-z transformation test.Seventy-two women were included, out of 247 RA patients, mostly white, with median (IQR) age of 57.5 (49.3-66.8) years, with RA symptoms for 13.0 (6.0-19.0) years and FM symptoms for 6.0 (2.0-15.0) years. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone use was comparable between groups. Objective activity parameters were not different between groups. RA patients with FM had greater DAS28, SDAI and CDAI but similar GS-US7 and PD-US7. GS-US7 correlated with DAS28, SDAI and CDAI in patients with and without FM (rs = 0.36-0.57), while PD-US7 correlated with clinical scores only in patients without FM (rs = 0.35-0.38).To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that ultrasound synovitis scores are not affected by FM in RA patients. PD-US7 performed better than GS-US7 in long-standing RA patients with DAS28, SDAI or CDAI allegedly overestimated due to FM. Since sonographic synovitis predicts erosion better than swollen joint count, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, US should be considered a promising treatment target in RA patients with FM."
https://openalex.org/W1967677604,"Aims We recently published that the positive inotropic response (PIR) to levosimendan can be fully accounted for by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition in both failing human heart and normal rat heart. To determine if the PIR of the active metabolite OR-1896, an important mediator of the long-term clinical effects of levosimendan, also results from PDE3 inhibition, we compared the effects of OR-1896, a representative Ca2+ sensitizer EMD57033 (EMD), levosimendan and other PDE inhibitors. Methods Contractile force was measured in rat ventricular strips. PDE assay was conducted on rat ventricular homogenate. cAMP was measured using RII_epac FRET-based sensors. Results OR-1896 evoked a maximum PIR of 33±10% above basal at 1 μM. This response was amplified in the presence of the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram (89±14%) and absent in the presence of the PDE3 inhibitors cilostamide (0.5±5.3%) or milrinone (3.2±4.4%). The PIR was accompanied by a lusitropic response, and both were reversed by muscarinic receptor stimulation with carbachol and absent in the presence of β-AR blockade with timolol. OR-1896 inhibited PDE activity and increased cAMP levels at concentrations giving PIRs. OR-1896 did not sensitize the concentration-response relationship to extracellular Ca2+. Levosimendan, OR-1896 and EMD all increased the sensitivity to β-AR stimulation. The combination of either EMD and levosimendan or EMD and OR-1896 further sensitized the response, indicating at least two different mechanisms responsible for the sensitization. Only EMD sensitized the α1-AR response. Conclusion The observed PIR to OR-1896 in rat ventricular strips is mediated through PDE3 inhibition, enhancing cAMP-mediated effects. These results further reinforce our previous finding that Ca2+ sensitization does not play a significant role in the inotropic (and lusitropic) effect of levosimendan, nor of its main metabolite OR-1896."
https://openalex.org/W1971428904,"Purpose The aim of this study was to define somatostatin (SST) and somatostatin receptor type 1 (SSTR1) methylation profiles for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors at diagnosis and follow up and to evaluate their prognostic significance and value as a biomarker. Methods Gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Promoter methylation status was determined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) in HNSCC. Results Methylation was associated with transcription inhibition. SST methylation in 81% of HNSCC tumor specimens significantly correlated with tumor size (P = 0.043), stage (P = 0.008), galanin receptor type 2 (GALR2) methylation (P = 0.041), and tachykinin-1 (TAC1) (P = 0.040). SSTR1 hypermethylation in 64% of cases was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.037), stage (P = 0.037), SST methylation (P < 0.001), and expression of galanin (P = 0.03), GALR2 (P = 0.014), TAC1 (P = 0.023), and tachykinin receptor type 1 (TACR1) (P = 0.003). SST and SSTR1 promoter hypermethylation showed highly discriminating receiver operator characteristic curve profiles, which clearly distinguished HNSCC from adjacent normal mucosal tissues. Concurrent hypermethylation of galanin and SSTR1 promoters correlated with reduced disease-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.0001). Among patients with oral cavity and oropharynx cancer, methylation of both SST and SSTR1 promoters correlated with reduced disease-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.028). In multivariate logistic-regression analysis, concomitant methylation of galanin and SSTR1 was associated with an odds ratio for recurrence of 12.53 (95% CI, 2.62 to 59.8; P = 0.002). Conclusions CpG hypermethylation is a likely mechanism of SST and SSTR1 gene inactivation, supporting the hypothesis that SST and SSTR1 play a role in the tumorigenesis of HNSCC and that this hypermethylation may serve as an important biomarker."
https://openalex.org/W2006592777,"The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit a wide range of viruses. We previously reported the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain BH10 by human IFITM1, 2 and 3. It is unknown whether other HIV-1 strains are similarly inhibited by IFITMs and whether there exists viral countermeasure to overcome IFITM inhibition. We report here that the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain (HIV-1NL4-3) is not restricted by IFITM1 and its viral envelope glycoprotein is partly responsible for this insensitivity. However, HIV-1NL4-3 is profoundly inhibited by an IFITM1 mutant, known as Δ(117–125), which is deleted of 9 amino acids at the C-terminus. In contrast to the wild type IFITM1, which does not affect HIV-1 entry, the Δ(117–125) mutant diminishes HIV-1NL4-3 entry by 3-fold. This inhibition correlates with the predominant localization of Δ(117–125) to the plasma membrane where HIV-1 entry occurs. In spite of strong conservation of IFITM1 among most species, mouse IFITM1 is 19 amino acids shorter at its C-terminus as compared to human IFITM1 and, like the human IFITM1 mutant Δ(117–125), mouse IFITM1 also inhibits HIV-1 entry. This is the first report illustrating the role of viral envelope protein in overcoming IFITM1 restriction. The results also demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal region of IFITM1 in modulating the antiviral function through controlling protein subcellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W1992481349,"The innate immune system is known to play an important role in oral tolerance to dietary antigens. This is important in development of celiac disease (CD) but may also be important in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and could potentially explain the reduced incidence of T1D in mice receiving a gluten-free (GF) diet. The direct in vivo effect of gluten on innate cells, and particularly dendritic cells (DC) is not sufficiently clarified. Therefore, we wished to investigate the innate cell populations of spontaneous diabetic NOD mice and healthy BALB/c mice kept on a GF or a standard (STD) gluten containing diet. We studied, by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), if dietary gluten induces changes in the activation of DCs and distribution of selected innate cells in lymphoid, pancreatic and intestinal tissues in BALB/c and NOD mice. We found that a GF diet increased the percentage of macrophages in BALB/c spleen and of CD11c+ DCs in BALB/c and NOD spleen. Strictly gluten-free (SGF) diet increased the percentage of CD103+ DCs in BALB/c mice and decreased percentages of CD11b+ DCs in mesenteric and pancreatic lymph nodes in BALB/c mice. SGF diet in BALB/c mice also decreased DC expression of CD40, CCR7 and MHC-II in pancreatic lymph nodes. In conclusion, GF diet changes the composition of the innate immune system in BALB/c and NOD mice and increases expression of DC activation markers in NOD mice. These results contribute to the explanation of the low diabetes incidence in GF NOD mice. This mechanism may be important in development of type 1 diabetes, celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2004372993,"Neurological outcomes of preterm infants with post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) remain among the worst in infancy, yet there remain few instruments to inform the treatment of PHH. We previously observed PHH-associated elevations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid precursor protein (APP), neural cell adhesion molecule-L1 (L1CAM), neural cell adhesion molecule-1 (NCAM-1), and other protein mediators of neurodevelopment.The objective of this study was to examine the association of CSF APP, L1CAM, and NCAM-1 with ventricular size as an early step toward developing CSF markers of PHH.CSF levels of APP, L1CAM, NCAM-1, and total protein (TP) were measured in 12 preterm infants undergoing PHH treatment. Ventricular size was determined using cranial ultrasounds. The relationships between CSF APP, L1CAM, and NCAM-1, occipitofrontal circumference (OFC), volume of CSF removed, and ventricular size were examined using correlation and regression analyses.CSF levels of APP, L1CAM, and NCAM-1 but not TP paralleled treatment-related changes in ventricular size. CSF APP demonstrated the strongest association with ventricular size, estimated by frontal-occipital horn ratio (FOR) (Pearson R = 0.76, p = 0.004), followed by NCAM-1 (R = 0.66, p = 0.02) and L1CAM (R = 0.57,p = 0.055). TP was not correlated with FOR (R = 0.02, p = 0.95).Herein, we report the novel observation that CSF APP shows a robust association with ventricular size in preterm infants treated for PHH. The results from this study suggest that CSF APP and related proteins at once hold promise as biomarkers of PHH and provide insight into the neurological consequences of PHH in the preterm infant."
https://openalex.org/W2024058297,"T-cell-mediated inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), play an important role in the initiation and progression of inflammatory airways diseases. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), widely used anticoagulants, possess anti-inflammatory properties making them potential treatment options for inflammatory diseases, including asthma. In the current study, we investigated the modulating effects of two LMWHs (enoxaparin and dalteparin) on the release of cytokines from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of asthmatic subjects to identify the specific components responsible for the effects.PBMCs from asthmatic subjects (consist of ~75% of T-cells) were isolated from blood taken from ten asthmatic subjects. The PBMCs were pre-treated in the presence or absence of different concentrations of LMWHs, and were then stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin for the release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-α. LMWHs were completely or selectively desulfated and their anticoagulant effect, as well as the ability to modulate cytokine release, was determined. LMWHs were chromatographically fractionated and each fraction was tested for molecular weight determination along with an assessment of anticoagulant potency and effect on cytokine release.Enoxaparin inhibited cytokine release by more than 48%, whereas dalteparin increased their release by more than 25%. The observed anti-inflammatory effects of enoxaparin were independent of their anticoagulant activities. Smaller fractions, in particular dp4 (four saccharide units), were responsible for the inhibitory effect of enoxaparin. Whereas, the larger fractions, in particular dp22 (twenty two saccharide units), were associated with the stimulatory effect of dalteparin.Enoxaparin and dalteparin demonstrated opposing effects on inflammatory markers. These observed effects could be due to the presence of structurally different components in the two LMWHs arising from different methods of depolymerisation. This study provides a platform for further studies investigating the usefulness of enoxaparin in various inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2026566258,"The leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor 1 (BLT1) is a high affinity receptor for LTB4, a chemotactic and inflammatory eicosanoid. The LTB4 receptor 2 (BLT2) was originally identified as a low affinity receptor for LTB4, and, more recently, as a high affinity receptor for 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). The zebrafish BLT receptors have not been previously identified and the in vivo functions of these receptors have been unknown. In this paper, we describe one zebrafish BLT1-like receptor, Blt1, and two zebrafish BLT2-like receptors, Blt2a and Blt2b. Cells expressing Blt1 exhibited LTB4-induced intracellular [Ca2+] increases, inhibition of cAMP production, ligand-dependent [35S]GTPγS binding, and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) shedding activity in a dose-dependent manner, similar to human BLT1. Cells expressing Blt2a and Blt2b exhibited 12-HHT- and LTB4-induced intracellular [Ca2+] increases, inhibition of cAMP production, [35S]GTPγS binding, and TGFα shedding activity, with a dose-dependency similar to human BLT2. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis and whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that blt1, blt2a, blt2b, zebrafish LTA4 hydrolase (lta4h), and zebrafish 5-lipoxiganase (5lo) are expressed in zebrafish embryos. Knockdown of blt1 by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides resulted in delayed epiboly at gastrulation. Consistently, knockdown of lta4h, an enzyme mediating LTB4 production, induced a phenotype similar to knockdown of blt1. These results suggest that the LTB4-BLT1 axis is involved in epiboly in zebrafish development."
https://openalex.org/W2051624191,"Up-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is frequently implicated in lung inflammation. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been shown to play a key role in inflammation via adhesion molecules induction, and then causes lung injury. However, the mechanisms underlying S1P-induced ICAM-1 expression in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs) remain unclear. The effect of S1P on ICAM-1 expression was determined by Western blot and real-time PCR. The involvement of signaling pathways in these responses was investigated by using the selective pharmacological inhibitors and transfection with siRNAs. S1P markedly induced ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion which were attenuated by pretreatment with the inhibitor of S1PR1 (W123), S1PR3 (CAY10444), c-Src (PP1), EGFR (AG1478), PDGFR (AG1296), MEK1/2 (U0126), p38 MAPK (SB202190), JNK1/2 (SP600125), PI3K (LY294002), or AP-1 (Tanshinone IIA) and transfection with siRNA of S1PR1, S1PR3, c-Src, EGFR, PDGFR, p38, p42, JNK1, c-Jun, or c-Fos. We observed that S1P-stimulated p42/p44 MAPK and p38 MAPK activation was mediated via a c-Src/EGFR and PDGFR-dependent pathway. S1P caused the c-Src/EGFR/PDGFR complex formation. On the other hand, we demonstrated that S1P induced p42/p44 MAPK and p38 MAPK-dependent Akt activation. In addition, S1P-stimulated JNK1/2 phosphorylation was attenuated by SP600125 or PP1. Finally, S1P enhanced c-Fos mRNA levels and c-Jun phosphorylation. S1P-induced c-Jun activation was reduced by PP1, AG1478, AG1296, U0126, SP600125, SB202190, or LY294002. These results demonstrated that S1P-induced ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adhesion were mediated through S1PR1/3/c-Src/EGFR, PDGFR/p38 MAPK, p42/p44 MAPK/Akt-dependent AP-1 activation."

Despite a traditional woody oil plant, our understanding on S. sebiferum genetics and molecular biology remains scant. In this study, the first comprehensive transcriptome of S. sebiferum flower has been generated by sequencing and de novo assembly. A total of 149,342 unigenes were generated from raw reads, of which 24,289 unigenes were successfully matched to public database. A total of 61 MADS box genes and putative pathways involved in S. sebiferum flower development have been identified. Abiotic stress response network was also constructed in this work, where 2,686 unigenes are involved in the pathway. As for lipid biosynthesis, 161 unigenes have been identified in fatty acid (FA) and triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis. Besides, the G-Quadruplexes in RNA of S. sebiferum also have been predicted. An interesting finding is that the stress-induced flowering was observed in S. sebiferum for the first time. According to the results of semi-quantitative PCR, expression tendencies of flowering-related genes, GA1, AP2 and CRY2, accorded with stress-related genes, such as GRX50435 and PRXⅡ39562. This transcriptome provides functional genomic information for further research of S. sebiferum, especially for the genetic engineering to shorten the juvenile period and improve yield by regulating flower development. It also offers a useful database for the research of other Euphorbiaceae family plants."
https://openalex.org/W1964532459,"Human footprint fossils have provided essential evidence about the evolution of human bipedalism as well as the social dynamics of the footprint makers, including estimates of speed, sex and group composition. Generally such estimates are made by comparing footprint evidence with modern controls; however, previous studies have not accounted for the variation in footprint dimensions coming from load bearing activities. It is likely that a portion of the hominins who created these fossil footprints were carrying a significant load, such as offspring or foraging loads, which caused variation in the footprint which could extend to variation in any estimations concerning the footprint’s maker. To identify significant variation in footprints due to load-bearing tasks, we had participants (N = 30, 15 males and 15 females) walk at a series of speeds carrying a 20kg pack on their back, side and front. Paint was applied to the bare feet of each participant to create footprints that were compared in terms of foot length, foot width and foot area. Female foot length and width increased during multiple loaded conditions. An appreciation of footprint variability associated with carrying loads adds an additional layer to our understanding of the behavior and morphology of extinct hominin populations."

Cholecystectomy (XGB) increases BAs recirculation rates resulting in increased tissue exposure to BAs during the light phase of the diurnal cycle in mice. We aimed to determine: 1) the effects of XGB on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and 2) the roles of TGR5 on XGB-dependent changes in BMR. Methods BMR was determined by indirect calorimetry in wild type and Tgr5 deficient (Tgr5-/-) male mice. Bile flow and BAs secretion rates were measured by surgical diversion of biliary duct. Biliary BAs and cholesterol were quantified by enzymatic methods. BAs serum concentration and specific composition was determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Gene expression was determined by qPCR analysis. Results XGB increased biliary BAs and cholesterol secretion rates, and elevated serum BAs concentration in wild type and Tgr5-/- mice during the light phase of the diurnal cycle. BMR was ~25% higher in cholecystectomized wild type mice (p <0.02), whereas no changes were detected in cholecystectomized Tgr5-/- mice compared to wild-type animals. Conclusion XGB increases BMR by TGR5-dependent mechanisms in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2052082509,"Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) are characterized by specific abnormalities that alter cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and apoptotic signaling. It is believed that cancer cells are particularly sensitive to cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). However, many cancer cells show blocked TRAIL signaling due to up-regulated expression of anti-apoptotic factors, such as cFLIP. This hurdle to TRAIL's tumor cytotoxicity might be overcome by combining TRAIL-based therapy with drugs that reverse blockages of its apoptotic signaling. In this study, we investigated the impact of a pan-methyltransferase inhibitor (3-deazaneplanocin A, or DZNep) on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in aggressive B-cell NHLs: mantle cell, Burkitt, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We characterized TRAIL apoptosis regulation and caspase activation in several NHL-derived cell lines pre-treated with DZNep. We found that DZNep increased cancer cell sensitivity to TRAIL signaling by promoting caspase-8 processing through accelerated cFLIP degradation. No change in cFLIP mRNA level indicated independence of promoter methylation alterations in methyltransferase activity induced by DZNep profoundly affected cFLIP mRNA stability and protein stability. This appears to be in part through increased levels of cFLIP-targeting microRNAs (miR-512-3p and miR-346). However, additional microRNAs and cFLIP-regulating mechanisms appear to be involved in DZNep-mediated enhanced response to extrinsic apoptotic stimuli. The capacity of DZNep to target cFLIP expression on multiple levels underscores DZNep's potential in TRAIL-based therapies for B-cell NHLs."

Human leishmaniasis is not endemic in Australia though imported cases are regularly encountered. This study aimed to provide an update on the molecular epidemiology of imported leishmaniasis in Australia. Of a total of 206 biopsies and bone marrow specimens submitted to St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney for leishmaniasis diagnosis by PCR, 55 were found to be positive for Leishmania DNA. All PCR products were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis for identification of the causative species. Five Leishmania species/species complexes were identified with Leishmania tropica being the most common (30/55). Travel or prior residence in a Leishmania endemic region was the most common route of acquisition with ~47% of patients having lived in or travelled to Afghanistan. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was the most common manifestation (94%) with only 3 cases of visceral leishmaniasis and no cases of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis encountered. This report indicates that imported leishmaniasis is becoming increasingly common in Australia due to an increase in global travel and immigration. As such, Australian clinicians must be made aware of this trend and consider leishmaniasis in patients with suspicious symptoms and a history of travel in endemic areas. This study also discusses the recent identification of a unique Leishmania species found in native kangaroos and a potential vector host which could create the opportunity for the establishment of a local transmission cycle within humans."
https://openalex.org/W2039095328,"Deregulated expression of oncogenes or transcription factors such as specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is observed in many human cancers and plays a role in tumor maintenance. Paradoxically in untransformed cells, Sp1 overexpression induces late apoptosis but the early intrinsic response is poorly characterized. In the present work, we studied increased Sp1 level consequences in untransformed cells and showed that it turns on an early innate immune transcriptome. Sp1 overexpression does not activate known cellular stress pathways such as DNA damage response or endoplasmic reticulum stress, but induces the activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway and the generation of small self-RNAs, leading to the upregulation of genes of the antiviral RIG-I pathway at the transcriptional and translational levels. Finally, Sp1-induced intrinsic innate immune response leads to the production of the chemokine CXCL4 and to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in vitro and in vivo. Altogether our results showed that increased Sp1 level in untransformed cells constitutes a novel danger signal sensed by the OAS-RNase L axis leading to the activation of the RIG-I pathway. These results suggested that the OAS-RNase L-RIG-I pathway may be activated in sterile condition in absence of pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2095109715,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TP53 (codon 72, rs1042522) and MDM2 promoter (SNP 309, rs2279744) have been associated with risk for various human cancers. However, studies analyzing these polymorphisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are lacking. We investigated TP53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP 309 polymorphisms in 32 patients with PDAC, 16 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), and 32 normal controls, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We also examined TP53 and MDM2 protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the involvement of these differences in malignant transformation and disease progression. TP53 Pro/Pro genotype was significantly more frequent in PDAC patients than in controls (65.6 vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) and no significant difference was found between CP patients (37.5%) and controls. In MDM2 SNP 309, there were no significant differences among the three groups. Based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis, overall survival was significantly shorter in MDM2 G/G genotypes compared with other genotypes (G/T and T/T) (359 vs. 911 days, p = 0.016) whereas no significant differences in TP53 genotypes were observed (638 vs. 752 days, p = 0.471). Although TP53 IHC was frequent in PDAC patients (53.1%), TP53 and MDM2 protein expression was not correlated with polymorphisms. Our study demonstrated TP53 codon 72 polymorphism is potentially a genetic predisposing factor while MDM2 SNP 309 polymorphism might be useful in predicting survival outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2086427745,"Importance Hypertension is common and costly. Over the past decade, new antihypertensive therapies have been developed, several have lost patent protection and additional evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of these agents has accrued. Objective To examine trends in the use of antihypertensive therapies in the United States between 1997 and 2012. Design, Setting and Participants We used nationally representative audit data from the IMS Health National Disease and Therapeutic Index to examine the ambulatory pharmacologic treatment of hypertension. Outcome Measures Our primary unit of analysis was a visit where hypertension was a reported diagnosis and treated with a pharmacotherapy (treatment visit). We restricted analyses to the use of six therapeutic classes of antihypertensive medications among individuals 18 years or older. Results Annual hypertension treatment visits increased from 56.9 million treatment visits (95% confidence intervals [CI], 53.9–59.8) in 1997 to 83.3 million visits (CI 79.2–87.3) in 2008, then declined steadily to 70.9 million visits (CI 66.7–75.0) by 2012. Angiotensin receptor blocker utilization increased substantially from 3% of treatment visits in 1997 to 18% by 2012, whereas calcium channel blocker use decreased from 27% to 18% of visits. Rates of diuretic and beta-blocker use remained stable and represented 24%–30% and 14–16% of visits, respectively. Use of direct renin inhibitor accounted for fewer than 2% of annual visits. The proportion of visits treated using fixed-dose combination therapies increased from 28% to 37% of visits. Conclusions Several important changes have occurred in the landscape of antihypertensive treatment in the United States during the past decade. Despite their novel mechanism of action, the adoption rate of direct renin inhibitors remains low."
https://openalex.org/W1969256574,"Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQR) is a redox-driven sodium pump operating in the respiratory chain of various bacteria, including pathogenic species. The enzyme has a unique set of redox active prosthetic groups, which includes two covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) residues attached to threonine residues in subunits NqrB and NqrC. The reason of FMN covalent bonding in the subunits has not been established yet. In the current work, binding of free FMN to the apo-form of NqrC from Vibrio harveyi was studied showing very low affinity of NqrC to FMN in the absence of its covalent bonding. To study structural aspects of flavin binding in NqrC, its holo-form was crystallized and its 3D structure was solved at 1.56 Å resolution. It was found that the isoalloxazine moiety of the FMN residue is buried in a hydrophobic cavity and that its pyrimidine ring is squeezed between hydrophobic amino acid residues while its benzene ring is extended from the protein surroundings. This structure of the flavin-binding pocket appears to provide flexibility of the benzene ring, which can help the FMN residue to take the bended conformation and thus to stabilize the one-electron reduced form of the prosthetic group. These properties may also lead to relatively weak noncovalent binding of the flavin. This fact along with periplasmic location of the FMN-binding domains in the vast majority of NqrC-like proteins may explain the necessity of the covalent bonding of this prosthetic group to prevent its loss to the external medium."
https://openalex.org/W2015154759,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is a differentiation agent that revolutionized the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, it has not been useful for other types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we explored the effect of SALL4, a stem cell factor, on ATRA-induced AML differentiation in both ATRA-sensitive and ATRA-resistant AML cells. Aberrant SALL4 expression has been found in nearly all human AML cases, whereas, in normal bone marrow and peripheral blood cells, its expression is only restricted to hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. We reason that, in AMLs, SALL4 activation may prevent cell differentiation and/or protect self-renewal that is seen in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Indeed, our studies show that ATRA-mediated myeloid differentiation can be largely blocked by exogenous expression of SALL4, whereas ATRA plus SALL4 knockdown causes significantly increased AML differentiation and cell death. Mechanistic studies indicate that SALL4 directly associates with retinoic acid receptor α and modulates ATRA target gene expression. SALL4 is shown to recruit lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) to target genes and alter the histone methylation status. Furthermore, coinhibition of LSD1 and SALL4 plus ATRA treatment exhibited the strongest anti-AML effect. These findings suggest that SALL4 plays an unfavorable role in ATRA-based regimes, highlighting an important aspect of leukemia therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2029601850,"Studying ethnically diverse groups is important for furthering our understanding of biological mechanisms of disease that may vary across human populations. The ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) is a well-established risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and may confer anatomic and functional effects years before clinical signs of cognitive decline are observed. The allele frequency of APOE ε4 varies both across and within populations, and the size of the effect it confers for dementia risk may be affected by other factors. Our objective was to investigate the role APOE ε4 plays in moderating brain volume in cognitively normal Chinese older adults, compared to older white Americans. We hypothesized that carrying APOE ε4 would be associated with reduced brain volume and that the magnitude of this effect would be different between ethnic groups. We performed whole brain analysis of structural MRIs from Chinese living in America (n = 41) and Shanghai (n = 30) and compared them to white Americans (n = 71). We found a significant interaction effect of carrying APOE ε4 and being Chinese. The APOE ε4xChinese interaction was associated with lower volume in bilateral cuneus and left middle frontal gyrus (Puncorrected<0.001), with suggestive findings in right entorhinal cortex and left hippocampus (Puncorrected<0.01), all regions that are associated with neurodegeneration in AD. After correction for multiple testing, the left cuneus remained significantly associated with the interaction effect (PFWE = 0.05). Our study suggests there is a differential effect of APOE ε4 on brain volume in Chinese versus white cognitively normal elderly adults. This represents a novel finding that, if verified in larger studies, has implications for how biological, environmental and/or lifestyle factors may modify APOE ε4 effects on the brain in diverse populations."
https://openalex.org/W2036473491,"The amount and form of dietary casein have been shown to affect energy metabolism and lipid accumulation in mice, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated 48 hrs urinary metabolome, hepatic lipid composition and gene expression in male C57BL/6J mice fed Western diets with 16 or 32 energy% protein in the form of extensively hydrolyzed or intact casein. LC-MS based metabolomics revealed a very strong impact of casein form on the urinary metabolome. Evaluation of the discriminatory metabolites using tandem mass spectrometry indicated that intake of extensively hydrolyzed casein modulated Phase II metabolism associated with an elevated urinary excretion of glucuronic acid- and sulphate conjugated molecules, whereas glycine conjugated molecules were more abundant in urine from mice fed the intact casein diets. Despite the differences in the urinary metabolome, we observed no differences in hepatic expression of genes involved in Phase II metabolism, but it was observed that expression of Abcc3 encoding ATP binding cassette c3 (transporter of glucuronic acid conjugates) was increased in livers of mice fed hydrolyzed casein. As glucuronic acid is derived from glucose and sulphate is derived from cysteine, our metabolomic data provided evidence for changes in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and we propose that this modulation of metabolism was associated with the reduced glucose and lipid levels observed in mice fed the extensively hydrolyzed casein diets."

Here, we present a novel strategy for the correction of VLCAD deficiency by increasing mutant VLCAD enzymatic activity. Treatment of VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts, which express distinct mutant VLCAD protein and exhibit deficient fatty acid β-oxidation, with S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine induced site-specific S-nitrosylation of VLCAD mutants at cysteine residue 237. Cysteine 237 S-nitrosylation was associated with an 8–17-fold increase in VLCAD-specific activity and concomitant correction of acylcarnitine profile and β-oxidation capacity, two hallmarks of the disorder. Overall, this study provides biochemical evidence for a potential therapeutic modality to correct β-oxidation deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2073851918,"Background Efforts to develop effective and regionally-appropriate emergency care systems in sub-Saharan Africa are hindered by a lack of data on both the burden of disease in the region and on the state of existing care delivery mechanisms. This study describes the burden of acute disease presenting to an emergency unit in Mahajanga, Madagascar. Methods and Findings Handwritten patient registries on all emergency department patients presenting between 1 January 2011 and 30 September 2012 were reviewed and data entered into a database. Data included age, sex, diagnosis, and disposition. We classified diagnoses into Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) multi-level categories. The population was 53.5% male, with a median age of 31 years. The five most common presenting conditions were 1) Superficial injury; contusion, 2) Open wounds of head; neck; and trunk, 3) Open wounds of extremities, 4) Intracranial injury, and 5) Unspecified injury and poisoning. Trauma accounted for 48%, Infectious Disease for 15%, Mental Health 6.1%, Noncommunicable 29%, and Neoplasms 1.2%. The acuity seen was high, with an admission rate of 43%. Trauma was the most common reason for admission, representing 19% of admitted patients. Conclusions This study describes the burden of acute disease at a large referral center in northern Madagascar. The Centre Hôpitalier Universitaire de Mahajanga sees a high volume of acutely ill and injured patients. Similar to other reports from the region, trauma is the most common pathology observed, though infectious disease was responsible for the majority of adult mortality. Typhoid fever other intestinal infections were the most lethal CCS-coded pathologies. By utilizing a widely understood classification system, we are able to highlight contrasts between Mahajanga’s acute and overall disease burden as well as make comparisons between this region and the rest of the globe. We hope this study will serve to guide the development of context-appropriate emergency medicine systems in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2093963478,"As a group, poxviruses have been shown to infect a wide variety of animal species. However, there is individual variability in the range of species able to be productively infected. In this study, we observed that ectromelia virus (ECTV) does not replicate efficiently in cultured rabbit RK13 cells. Conversely, vaccinia virus (VACV) replicates well in these cells. Upon infection of RK13 cells, the replication cycle of ECTV is abortive in nature, resulting in a greatly reduced ability to spread among cells in culture. We observed ample levels of early gene expression but reduced detection of virus factories and severely blunted production of enveloped virus at the cell surface. This work focused on two important host range genes, named E3L and K3L, in VACV. Both VACV and ECTV express a functional protein product from the E3L gene, but only VACV contains an intact K3L gene. To better understand the discrepancy in replication capacity of these viruses, we examined the ability of ECTV to replicate in wild-type RK13 cells compared to cells that constitutively express E3 and K3 from VACV. The role these proteins play in the ability of VACV to replicate in RK13 cells was also analyzed to determine their individual contribution to viral replication and PKR activation. Since E3L and K3L are two relevant host range genes, we hypothesized that expression of one or both of them may have a positive impact on the ability of ECTV to replicate in RK13 cells. Using various methods to assess virus growth, we did not detect any significant differences with respect to the replication of ECTV between wild-type RK13 compared to versions of this cell line that stably expressed VACV E3 alone or in combination with K3. Therefore, there remain unanswered questions related to the factors that limit the host range of ECTV."
https://openalex.org/W2058982943,"Variations in the frequency and extent of hybridization among mixed populations located in the same contact zone provide natural laboratories for the study of extrinsic reproductive isolation maintaining species integrity. In this study, we examined the pattern of hybridization between L. japonicum and L. stellipilum among mixed populations in different localities of a contact zone. The genetic structures from three sympatric populations and six mixed populations in the hybrid zone, and five reference populations far from the contact zone, were characterized using 10 neutral nuclear microsatellite markers. Evidence from genetic distance-based clustering analysis, the frequency distribution of admixture proportion values, and the hybrid category assignment approaches indicated that the frequency and extent of hybridization varied considerably among populations in the contact zone between L. japonicum and L. stellipilum. One likely explanation is that variation in exogenous (ecological) selection among populations might contribute to differences in frequency and extent of hybridization. The present study will facilitate future research exploring the evolution of reproductive isolation between L. japonicum and L. stellipilum."
https://openalex.org/W2046366602,"We previously found that mouse mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with a G13997A mutation (G13997A mtDNA) controls not only the transformation of cultured lung carcinoma cells from poorly metastatic into highly metastatic cells, but also the transformation of lymphocytes into lymphomas in living C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Because the nuclear genetic background of the B6 strain makes the strain prone to develop lymphomas, here we examined whether G13997A mtDNA independently induces lymphoma development even in mice with the nuclear genetic background of the A/J strain, which is not prone to develop lymphomas. Our results showed that the B6 nuclear genetic background is required for frequent lymphoma development in mice with G13997A mtDNA. Moreover, G13997A mtDNA in mice did not enhance the malignant transformation of lung adenomas into adenocarcinomas or that of hepatocellular carcinomas from poorly metastatic into highly metastatic carcinomas. Therefore, G13997A mtDNA enhances the frequency of lymphoma development under the abnormalities in the B6 nuclear genome, and does not independently control tumor development and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2083147881,"Background Study samples should be appropriately selected to maximize generalizability of results. Excluding one sex from studies of conditions that affect both sexes is problematic and has received attention as a public policy issue in the United States, resulting in legislation and recommendations made by the National Institutes of Health to address this deficiency of study designs. It is unknown to what extent biomechanical studies have inappropriately excluded one sex. The objective of this study was to provide objective data on this question. Methods A retrospective review of random samples of abstracts presented at American Society of Biomechanics annual meetings from 1983 to 2013 was conducted to assess reporting of sex of study samples and whether the study samples were approximately balanced with respect to sex. Findings We did not find a statistically significant increasing trend in the percentage of abstracts reporting sex over time. However, increasing trends were noted in the percentage of abstracts including both sexes (p < 0.05) and percentage of abstracts having an “approximately balanced” study sample containing 50 ± 20% females (p > 0.05). In 2013 the percentage of abstracts reporting studies having approximately balanced study samples was only 28%, far from the ideal level of 100%. Interpretation While there has been modest change since 1983, there remains significant room for improvement in the reporting and composition of experimental studies reported at American Society of Biomechanics annual meetings."
