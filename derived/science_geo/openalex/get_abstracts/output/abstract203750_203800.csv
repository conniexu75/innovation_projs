These observations serve to distinguish the replication of viral ribonucleic from ribonucleic acid synthesis which is controlled by viral or cellular deoxyribonucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2033914964,"It has been found that soluble guanidine salts show an antiviral effect on poliovirus and on some other enteroviruses. The activity was first detected in a cell culture screening system when the guanidine salt of hydroxyaminomethylene malononitrile inhibited the cytopathic effect of poliovirus in cell cultures. The studies were extended to various in vivo experiments in which the suggestive therapeutic activity of guanidine salts was again observed in monkeys infected with poliovirus. While these drugs cannot be considered for use in human disease because of severe toxicity, it is significant that potential antiviral compounds detected by the cell culture test show in vivo activity and point to the validity of such direct chemotherapeutic trials."

This amino acid has also been found in very high concentration in the toxic seed of Lathyrus sylvestris Wagneri A structural relationship between this factor, the lathyrus factor from Lathyrus odoratus, and β-cyano-L-alanine, a new, synthetic neuroactive amino acid nitrile, is pointed out, and a possible biosynthetic pathway relating these is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1994183977,Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial endospores can be germinated if calcium chloride and dipicolinic acid are added to well-washed suspensions. Maximum germination is obtained when the calcium and acid are present in a molar ratio of one or more. This suggests that the 1:1 chelate of calcium and dipicolinic acid is the agent that induces germination.

https://openalex.org/W2029404327,More than 30 mouse tumors are associated with virus-like agents that may readily be detected by enzymic techniques. Radiation and chemically induced tumors do not ordinarily give evidence of such activity. The present report is of experiments in which a synergistic effect has been observed to occur when animals were inoculated with both the filtrable agent and a virus-free tumor. Synergism was shown by accelerated growth of the tumor and by elevation of a glycolytic enzyme (lactic dehydrogenase) in the host plasma

The nature of the chlorpromazine action and its competition with lysergic acid diethylamide is revealed by the effects of chlorpromazine in larger doses."

https://openalex.org/W2055215455,"IN 1930 citrulline was discovered in water-melons1. Later it was shown to be an important participant in the Krebs and Henseleit ornithine cycle in animals and micro-organisms. In recent years several laboratories have worked on the ornithine cycle in plants. In this laboratory citrulline has been shown to play an important part in transporting and storing nitrogen in several families of higher plants2–4. Relatively high concentrations of citrulline in exuding sap and citrulline accumulated in artificially rooted leaves of alder trees show the root to have a determining influence in the biosynthesis of citrulline. However, excised branches of alder and hazel could also synthesize citrulline from ammonium nitrate under aseptic conditions. Though ornithine, the precursor of citrulline, is metabolized very quickly, we could not find significant amounts of it, but very high concentrations of the mono-N-acetyl-ornithine were found in all members of the family Fumariaceae, being characteristic of this family6. Ornithine reacting with carbamyl phosphate in the presence of carbamyl-transpherase is converted into citrulline. My experiments have shown this reaction to occur under physiological conditions even without enzyme, though converting carbamyl phosphate much more slowly to cyanate, which reacts with the amino-groups6,7. It was also possible to establish the biosynthesis of citrulline from ornithine and carbamyl phosphate in higher plants8–11."

https://openalex.org/W1973802753,"SINCE Werbitzki's1 observations that organic dyes having Ehrlich's orthoquinoid constitution caused disappearance of the kinetoplast in trypanosomes, several workers have, from time to time, reported the occurrence of both spontaneous and chemically induced strains of akinetoplastic T. evansi. Hoare2 has fully discussed the early literature on the subject. Recently, Muhlpfordt3 has published his observations on the effect of trypaflavin on the kinetoplast of various trypanosomes, and has shown that repeated administration of trypaflavin caused the complete disappearance of kinetoplast in T. evansi in 81 days. With other trypanosomes such as T. equiperdum, T. brucei and T. gambiense it took 54, 121 and 122 days, respectively, for the complete disappearance of this organelle."

It produced a Cxprotein response on intravenous injection into normal rabbits, an anamnestic response in immunized rabbits, leucocyte changes characteristic of inflammation, and marked toxicity in rabbits with reticuloendothelial system blockade. Normal seromucoid did not possess these properties."
https://openalex.org/W2056018044,"COMPARING the in vitro calcium-45 uptake by bone salts (ashed by a method slightly modified from that of Gabriel) from alcoholic and aqueous calcium-45 labelled calcium chloride solutions, we have been able to demonstrate the occurrence of remodelling phenomena (chemical reaction between the solid and the ions dispersed in the liquid phase, recrystallization sensu stricto) and of an isoionic exchange, which reaches an equilibrium when 8 per cent of the calcium ions of the solid are involved. All remodelling processes being discarded, we believe that this figure corresponds to a pure exchange value. In our conditions, the intracrystalline ion exchange by thermal vibration is too slow to interfere with the surface exchange process1."

We were aware of the references1,2 listed by Prof. Gustavson when referring to the gradual shrinkage of collagen at temperatures below the instantaneous shrinkage temperature. However, we took these observations to be complementary to the physical experiments of Weir3, which show the ‘rate process’ nature of the shrinkage phenomenon and to which we did refer."
