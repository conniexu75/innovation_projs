The liquid phase is decanted to another test-tube, evaporated and the residual xanthogenate dissolved in a drop of water. The resulting solution is developed by paper partition chromatography (ascending method) using alkaline butanol (2 per cent potassium hydroxide) as solvent. About twenty hours is required. The location of the xanthogenates on the paper is detected easily by their dark brown luminescence under ultraviolet light or by the yellow or blue colours produced by spraying with Grote's reagent1. In the case of solid alcohols, the xanthogenate formed is dissolved in formamide and developed in the same way. The RF of formamide solutions of potassium xanthogenates, however, indicates, assuming the following reaction, the values of the corresponding ammonium xanthogenates:"

https://openalex.org/W1964662316,"THE international unit of vitamin A activity corresponds with 0.3 µgm. of vitamin A alcohol or 0.345 µgm. of vitamin A acetate1. The International Standard Preparation is a solution of the all-trans acetate in cottonseed oil, and it serves a dual purpose as a biological and a spectrophotometric standard of reference. The properties of the acetate are therefore important."

https://openalex.org/W1967657178,THE immediate source of the hormone which induces moulting in the larvæ and pupæ of Lepidoptera is the prothoracic gland1. But this gland is itself activated by a secretion from neuro-secretory cells in the dorsum of the brain2. It has seemed probable for some time that a similar two-stage control of moulting might exist in other insects3; and recently it has been found by Possompès4 that the lateral cells of the ring gland in the larvæ of Diptera are induced to secrete the pupation hormone by a factor liberated from the brain.

https://openalex.org/W2015931846,"OUTBREAKS of parasitic disease in lambs have occurred in the north of England during June and July 1951. Deaths have been associated with the presence of large numbers of nematodes of the genus Nematodirus. We are grateful to Mr. W. Lyle Stewart, who sent us the contents of the intestines of five lambs which had been sent to him for examination. About two million worms were received, and the collection was remarkable not only because of the large numbers but also because more than 90 per cent of the worms belonged to the genus Nematodirus. Examination showed that there were no N. spathiger, a large number of N. filicollis and a large number of a third species of Nematodirus. This last species cannot be referred to any known member of the genus, and it is proposed to name it Nematodirus battus. The description is as follows."

(‘Germidin’, Bionova, Ltd., Copenhagen) and lauryl-benzyldimethylammonium chloride (‘Rodalon’, Ferrosan, Ltd., Copenhagen), was observed."

https://openalex.org/W2321504987,"THERE are numerous examples of complex compounds formed by trivalent phosphorus compounds which have an electron pair available for the formation of dative bonds1, and recently this knowledge has been extended by the preparation of phosphorus trifluoride complexes of divalent platinum2. There is a close analogy between the lower halides of phosphorus and carbon monoxide in such compounds, and this analogy has been strengthened by the recent preparation of the tetrakistrihalogenophosphine nickels, Ni(PCl3)43, Ni(PBr3)44, and Ni(PF3)44; the latter is a volatile liquid similar to nickel carbonyl, Ni(CO)4. It was therefore thought that phosphorus trifluoride might form a complex with ferrohæmoglobin similar to the well-known covalent complexes with carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, isocyanides, etc.5. The existence of such a phosphorus trifluoride–hæmoglobin compound has been established, providing further evidence for the covalent bonding ability of phosphorus trifluoride."

This is particularly true of the soft-rot organisms and of those pathogens causing diseases of the parenchyma."

https://openalex.org/W2033986177,"IT has already been shown that antibiotic-producing streptococci other than the lactic group (Lancefield's Group N) are rare. The difficulties of survey were increased by toxic metabolic by-products, lactic acid in particular giving false inhibitory reactions on agar1. During the later stages of this work (unpublished) neutralized culture fluids were used to overcome the inhibitory effects of lactic acid. A cylinder-plate method was used for assays with Staphylococcus aureus (491) as the test organism. Several strains of streptococci were isolated from silage, the neutralized culture fluids of which gave 20-mm. zones of inhibition, while the un-neutralized acid culture fluids were inactive. These cultures were proved serologically to belong to Group N (Str. lactis), yet the inhibitory substance produced is inactive in acid media and is heat-labile, characters distinguishing it from the main antibiotic, nisin, produced by Str. lactis2."
