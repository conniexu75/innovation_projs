https://openalex.org/W1550693054,"Bafilomycin A1 is known as a strong inhibitor of the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase in vitro, whereas other type ATPases, e.g. F1,F0-ATPase, are not affected by this antibiotic (Bowman, E.M., Siebers, A., and Altendorf, K. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 7972-7976). Effects of this inhibitor on lysosomes of living cultured cells were tested. The acidification of lysosomes revealed by the incubation with acridine orange was completely inhibited when BNL CL.2 and A431 cells were treated with 0.1-1 microM bafilomycin A1. The effect was revealed by washing the cells. Both studies using 3-(2,4-dinitroanilino)-3'-amino-N-methyldipropylamine and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran showed that the intralysomal pH of A431 cells increased from about 5.1-5.5 to about 6.3 in the presence of 1 microM bafilomycin A1. The pH increased gradually in about 50 min. In the presence of 1 microM bafilomycin A1, 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) bound to the cell surface at 4 degrees C was internalized normally into the cells at 37 degrees C but was not degraded at all, in marked contrast to the rapid degradation of 125I-EGF in the control cells without the drug. Immunogold electron microscopy showed that EGF was transported into lysosomes irrespective of the addition of bafilomycin A1. These results suggest that the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase plays a pivotal role in acidification and protein degradation in the lysosomes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1999447199,"The v-akt oncogene codes for a 105-kilodalton fusion phosphoprotein containing Gag sequences at its amino terminus. Sequence analysis of v-akt and biochemical characterization of its product revealed that it codes for a protein kinase C-related serine-threonine kinase whose cellular homolog is expressed in most tissues, with the highest amount found in thymus. Although Akt is a serine-threonine kinase, part of its regulatory region is similar to the Src homology-2 domain, a structural motif characteristic of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that functions in protein-protein interactions. This suggests that Akt may form a functional link between tyrosine and serine-threonine phosphorylation pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1966797025,"A new human cyclin, named cyclin E, was isolated by complementation of a triple cln deletion in S. cerevisiae. Cyclin E showed genetic interactions with the CDC28 gene, suggesting that it functioned at START by interacting with the CDC28 protein. Two human genes were identified that could interact with cyclin E to perform START in yeast containing a cdc28 mutation. One was CDC2-HS, and the second was the human homolog of Xenopus CDK2. Cyclin E produced in E. coli bound and activated the CDC2 protein in extracts from human G1 cells, and antibodies against cyclin E immunoprecipitated a histone H1 kinase from HeLa cells. The interactions between cyclin E and CDC2, or CDK2, may be important at the G1 to S transition in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1583498277,"The hypothesis that the last step in the biosynthesis of 4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6 from linolenate is catalyzed by an acyl-CoA-dependent 4-desaturase has never been evaluated by direct experimentation. When rat liver microsomes were incubated with [1-14C]7,10,13,16,19-22:5, under conditions where linoleate was readily desaturated to 6,9,12-18:3, it was never possible to detect the product of the putative 4-desaturase. In the presence of malonyl-CoA, 7,10,13,16,19-22:5 was sequentially chain-elongated to 9,12,15,18,21-24:5, followed by its desaturation at position 6 to give 6,9,12,15,18,21-24:6. Microsomes desaturated 9,12,15,18,21-24:5 at rates similar to those observed for metabolizing linoleate to 6,9,12-18:3. Rat hepatocytes metabolize [1-14C]7,10,13,16,19-22:5 to 22:6(n-3), but in addition, it was possible to detect small amounts of esterified 24:5(n-3) and 24:6(n-3) in phospholipids, which is a finding consistent with their role as obligatory intermediates in 22:6(n-3) biosynthesis. When 3-14C-labeled 24:5(n-3) or 24:6(n-3) were incubated with hepatocytes, only a small amount of either substrate was esterified. [3-14C] 24:5(n-3) was metabolized both by beta-oxidation to 22:5(n-3) and by serving as a precursor for the biosynthesis of 24:6(n-3) and 22:6(n-3). The primary metabolic fate of [3-14C]24:6(n-3) was beta-oxidation to 22:6(n-3), followed by its acylation into membrane lipids. Our results thus document that 22:5(n-3) is the precursor for 22:6(n-3) but via a pathway that is independent of a 4-desaturase. This pathway involves the microsomal chain elongation of 22:5(n-3) to 24:5(n-3), followed by its desaturation to 24:6(n-3). This microsomal product is then metabolized, via beta-oxidation, to 22:6(n-3)."
https://openalex.org/W2087831434,"cDNA clones encoding two receptor proteins involved in the binding of human interleukin 5 (hIL5) have been isolated. A first class codes for an IL5-specific chain (hIL5Rα). The major transcript of this receptor gene, as analyzed in both HL-60 eosinophilic cells and eosinophilic myelocytes grown from cord blood, encodes a secreted form of this receptor. This soluble hIL5Rα has antagonistic properties. A second component of the hIL5R is found to be identical to the β chain of the human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) high affinity receptor. The finding that IL5 and GM-CSF share a receptor subunit provides a molecular basis for the observation that these cytokines can partially interfere with each other's binding and have highly overlapping biological activities on eosinophils."
https://openalex.org/W2032169064,"In the presence of antigen presenting cells, a murine T helper (Th) cell specific for murine hemoglobin (Hb) responded to its immunogenic peptide by both cytokine (interleukin-4) secretion and proliferation. An altered Hb peptide with a single amino acid substitution induced only cytokine secretion and did not induce proliferation. Interleukin-1 costimulated and restored the Th proliferative response to normal levels. The altered peptide also supported cognate T cell-B cell interactions indicative of T cell helper function. Thus, this result suggests that the T cell receptor has the capacity of differential signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1989721036,"Studies in Xenopus have shown that growth factors of the TGF beta and Wnt oncogene families can mimic aspects of dorsal axis formation. Here we directly compare the inductive properties of two Wnt proteins by injecting synthetic mRNA into developing embryos. The results show that Wnt-1 and Xwnt-8 can induce a new and complete dorsal axis and can rescue the development of axis-deficient, UV-irradiated embryos. In contrast, activin mRNA injection induces only a partial dorsal axis that lacks anterior structures. These studies demonstrate that the mechanism of Wnt-induced axis duplication results from the creation of an independent Spemann organizer. The relationship between the properties of the endogenous dorsal inducer and the effects of Wnts and activins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2057058623,"The adenovirus large E1A protein is a potent activator of transcription. We use several different experimental approaches to demonstrate that the large E1A protein binds specifically and stably to the TATA box-binding factor (TFIID), the general polymerase II transcription factor that initiates assembly of transcription complexes. Sedimentation velocity centrifugation revealed that TFIID and E1A form a heterodimer in vitro. We demonstrate that the activation domain of E1A (conserved region 3) binds to TFIID. E1A interacts with a 51 residue region from the conserved C-terminal domain of TFIID that includes a repeat of basic residues between the homologous direct repeats of TFIID. Analysis of TFIID binding by various EIA mutants indicates that TFIID binding is necessary, although not sufficient, for E1A transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1504997501,"The transport of precursor proteins into mitochondria requires an energized inner membrane. We report here that the import of various precursor proteins showed a differential sensitivity to treatment of the mitochondria with the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. The differential inhibition by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone was not influenced by the length of the precursor, the presence of mature protein parts, or the folding state of the precursor but was specific for the presequence. Moreover, only the membrane potential delta psi and not the total proton motive force was required for the transport of precursors, indicating that protein translocation across the inner membrane is not driven by a movement of protons. We conclude that delta psi (negative inside) is needed for the translocation of the positively charged presequences, possibly via an electrophoretic effect."
https://openalex.org/W2087680489,"The NTRC protein of enteric bacteria is an enhancer-binding protein that activates transcription in response to limitation of combined nitrogen. NTRC activates transcription by catalyzing formation of open complexes by RNA polymerase (sigma 54 holoenzyme form) in an ATP-dependent reaction. To catalyze open complex formation, NTRC must be phosphorylated. We show that phosphorylated NTRC has an ATPase activity, and we present biochemical and genetic evidence that NTRC must hydrolyze ATP to catalyze open complex formation. It is likely that all activators of sigma 54 holoenzyme have an ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1528772866,"Recent studies (e.g. Blackmore, P. F., Beebe, S. J., Danforth, D. R., and Alexander, N.) (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1376-1380) have shown that in human sperm, progesterone produces a rapid increase in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and an induction of the acrosome reaction (e.g. Osman, R. A., Andria, M. L., Jones, A. D., and Meizel, S. (1989) Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 160, 828-833). In this study, the location of progesterone receptors on the cell surface of human sperm was identified using progesterone immobilized on bovine serum albumin (BSA) (progesterone 3-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime:BSA) as well as progesterone and its 3-O-carboxymethyloxime derivative. Using fluorescence microscopy, BSA-fluorescein isothiocyanate was shown to be excluded from intact sperm, thus validating the use of progesterone 3-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime:BSA to identify cell surface-binding sites for progesterone. The immobilized progesterone and the 3-O-carboxymethyloxime derivative rapidly increased [Ca2+]i and were full agonists, although they were approximately 1.5 orders of magnitude less potent than progesterone. They also displayed an identical time course to increase [Ca2+]i as free progesterone, and the entire increase in [Ca2+]i was due to the influx of Ca2+. This progesterone-mediated response displayed different steroid receptor characteristics since the very potent inhibitors of genomic progesterone responses, RU38486 and ZK98.299, were very ineffective at inhibiting the progesterone-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. Also the synthetic progestins megestrol, medroxyprogesterone acetate, norgestrel, norethynodrel, norethindrone, R5020, and cyproterone acetate did not mimic the effects of progesterone to increase [Ca2+]i. It is proposed that a distinct nongenomic cell surface receptor for progesterone exists in human sperm."
https://openalex.org/W1631084000,"Proteolytic (trypsin) treatment removes a small terminal segment from the 100-kDa plant plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase. This results in activation of H+ pumping across the plasma membrane, suggesting that an inhibitory domain is located in one of the terminal regions of the enzyme (Palmgren, M.G., Larsson, C., and Sommarin, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13423-13426). In order to identify the origin of the fragment released by trypsin, polyclonal antibodies were raised against the first 55 amino acids (N-terminal region), the last 99 amino acids (C-terminal region), and a portion of 150 amino acids in the central part of the enzyme as deduced from one of the H(+)-ATPase genes (PMA2) of Arabidopsis thaliana. The native, 100-kDa H(+)-ATPase was recognized by all three antisera in Western blots. By contrast, the approximately 90-kDa polypeptide appearing after trypsin treatment was only recognized by the antisera against the N-terminal and central region, but not by the antiserum against the C-terminal region, suggesting that the inhibitory domain is located in this part of the enzyme. To more closely determine the position of the inhibitory domain, three peptides representing conserved parts of the C-terminal region were synthesized (residues 861-888, 912-943, and 936-949 of the Arabidopsis (PMA2) sequence). Only one of the peptides (residues 861-888) affected H+ pumping by the trypsin-activated (approximately 90-kDa) enzyme. This peptide of 28 amino acids inhibited H+ pumping with an IC50 of about 15 microM, suggesting that the auto-inhibitory domain is located within the corresponding part of the C-terminal region."

https://openalex.org/W1967309573,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a polypeptide cytokine that mediates many physiological responses to infection and inflammation and is a growth factor for certain mammalian cells. Virulent and avirulent clinical isolates of Escherichia coli were grown in culture media in the presence of human IL-1. IL-1β, but not tumor necrosis factor or IL-4, enhanced the growth of virulent, but not avirulent, E. coli. This enhancement was blocked by the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Radiolabeled IL-1 bound to virulent but not avirulent E. coli in a specific and saturable fashion; IL-1ra inhibited this binding. Thus, human IL-1 may recognize a functional IL-1-like receptor structure on virulent E. coli and may be a virulence factor for bacterial pathogenicity."

https://openalex.org/W1496627300,"We report the characterization of two functional domains of the metastasis-associated 67-kDa laminin receptor (67-LR). Using synthetic peptides deduced from the cDNA sequence of the 37-kDa precursor of the laminin receptor (37-LRP) as well as their corresponding affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies, we identified a unique laminin binding site as well as a membrane-associated domain of the receptor. In laminin dot blot and solid phase radioligand assays, a 20 amino acid synthetic peptide (IPCNNKGAHSVGLMWWMLAR, amino acid residues 161-180, designated peptide G) specifically bound to laminin with high affinity (Kd = 5 x 10(-8) M). Peptide G also specifically eluted the 67-LR from a laminin affinity column. Peptide G and laminin reacted with a 1:1 stoichiometry, suggesting that there is one recognition site on laminin for the peptide G domain. Immunofluorescence studies, performed on permeabilized and nonpermeabilized human A2058 melanoma cells using 10 different affinity-purified antibodies to distinct regions of the 37-LRP, identified an unusually short membrane-associated domain that was consistent with a computer predicted transmembrane domain (residues 86-101). Our data demonstrate for the first time that the 37-LRP has two functional domains consistent with the characteristics of the mature 67-LR. Furthermore, we propose peptide G as a potential inhibitor of tumor cell interactions with laminin."
https://openalex.org/W1555753650,"In this study, we have investigated the biosynthesis and processing of GP85 (Pgp-1/CD44), a lymphoma transmembrane glycoprotein known to contain ankyrin-binding site(s). Using a standard pulse-chase protocol, we have detected a 52-kDa polypeptide precursor (p52) within the first 5 min of pulse labeling which contains a high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharide chains. The conversion of p52 to GP85 requires further glycosylation (both complex type N-linked and O-linked) which takes place in the Golgi complex within 10-20 min after p52 is synthesized. GP85 is then incorporated into the plasma membrane where its turnover rate is relatively slow, a t1/2 of approximately 8 h. Following tunicamycin treatment, we have detected two other precursor proteins: p42 which is unglycosylated and p58 which is O-glycosylated. p42 appears to be an immediate precursor of p52 because p52 is converted to p42 upon deglycosylation. Therefore, the biosynthesis of GP85 appears to occur in the following sequence: p42 in equilibrium to p52 in equilibrium to GP85. Further analysis reveals that all of the GP85 precursors (i.e. p42, p52, and p58) contain ankyrin-binding site(s). Chemical composition analysis of GP85 indicates that this molecule contains approximately 3 N-linked and 4-5 O-linked oligosaccharide chains. Although neither N-glycosylation nor O-glycosylation appears to play an important role in the formation of ankyrin-binding site(s), O-glycosylation (and to a lesser extent N-glycosylation) of GP85 is required for T-lymphoma cell surface interaction with both collagen and hyaluronic acid. These findings suggest that GP85 (Pgp-1/CD44) and its biosynthetic precursors play a pivotal role in regulating adhesion functions such as lymphocyte homing and binding to the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2028228610,"The high affinity receptor that binds the Fc domain of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses 1 and 3 (FcγRI) mediates important immune defense functions by inducing cell surface changes on human leukocytes. In this article, we document direct high affinity binding of FcγRI to the actin filament cross-linking protein, actin-binding protein (ABP). In the absence of IgG, all FcγRI molecules in undifferentiated cells of myeloid line U937 bound to ABP over a 9-fold range of FcγRI expression induced by human IFN-γ. Binding of IgG to U937 cells constitutively expressing FcγRI or to COS cells genetically transfected to express FcγRI rapidly decreased the avidity of FcγRI for ABP. This finding suggests the existence of a pathway communicating a signal between a functional IgG receptor and intracellular components involved in the effector responses to FcγRI-ligand interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1501756036,"We have examined the binding of human and rodent interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) to the type II IL-1 receptor on the human B cell line, Raji, on the mouse pre-B cell line, 70Z/3, and on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Human IL-1ra binds to the receptors on the human B cells with an affinity (KD = 15 +/- 3 nM) equal to that of IL-1 alpha and only 15-fold lower than that of IL-1 beta and, likewise, binds to human PMNs with an affinity (KD = 8 +/- 4 nM) 15-fold lower than that of IL-1 beta. Mouse and rat IL-1ra bind to these two human cell types with an affinity similar to that of the human protein. Human IL-1ra binds very weakly to the type II receptor on the mouse pre-B cells with an affinity (KD = 1.4 +/- 0.2 microM) about 1500-fold lower than human IL-1 beta. Mouse and rat IL-1ra also bind to the mouse pre-B cells with low affinity. The weak binding of the three IL-1ra proteins to these mouse cells appears to be more a consequence of the cell type rather than species specificity. There may be a population of cells for which the actions of IL-1 cannot be effectively opposed by IL-1ra, although this group does not include mature B cells and PMNs."
https://openalex.org/W2040463675,"We have cloned a cDNA for dynamin, a 100 kd microtubule-associated motor protein whose 5' region contains a GTP-binding motif homologous to that of the Mx proteins, from a rat brain library and analyzed its expression. Dynamin mRNA is 3.6 kb and is preferentially expressed in the brain after postnatal day 7, parallel to the developmental increase of the protein. In situ hybridization revealed high levels of dynamin transcripts in neural cells in the cerebellar cortex, hippocampus (particularly in the CA3 area), and cerebral cortex. The transcripts appeared in cerebellar granular cells only after they had ceased dividing and had migrated to the inner granular layer. We show that dynamin is expressed predominantly in neural cells after elongation of their processes, suggesting a role especially in mature neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1604665359,"The application of electrophoretic resolution of the different phosphorylation species of pentameric phospholamban as a measure of phosphorylation stoichiometry was examined and verified. This enabled a critical evaluation of a number of issues central to current models of calcium pump regulation in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. The phospholamban content of numerous preparations was calculated from 32P incorporation at a given stoichiometry, and compared with the respective calcium pump concentration (derived by comparison with a Coomassie-stained calibration curve of the fast-twitch skeletal muscle isozyme). A relationship of 2 mol of phospholamban:1 mol of ATPase resulted (phospholamban monomer:ATPase monomer), which was maintained throughout all vesicle subpopulations. The precise mechanism of coupling of phospholamban phosphorylation to calcium pump stimulation was probed, with particular emphasis on the individual contributions of each phosphorylated species (P1 to P5). This relationship could be adequately explained in three ways: (i) each phosphorylation event contributed equally to calcium pump stimulation; (ii) P1 and P2 were incapable of stimulating calcium pump activity, but full stimulation occurred upon generation of species P3; or (iii) the phosphospecies P1 was without effect on basal calcium pump activity, but successive phosphorylations contributed equally to stimulation. Finally, the functional implication of dual site phosphorylation of phospholamban (cAMP- and the endogenous calmodulin-dependent kinases) was examined. No change in calcium pump activity accompanied the second tier of phosphorylation over that achieved by the first."
https://openalex.org/W1597984626,"We have synthesized a series of L-isoaspartyl-containing (isoD) peptides and characterized their interaction with the human erythrocyte L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl protein methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77). Our findings indicate that this enzyme interacts with 6 residues extending from the isoD-2 to isoD+3 positions in peptide substrates. Although peptides as simple as G-isoD-G are methylated with low affinity (Km = 17.8 mM), a wide variety of L-isoaspartyl-containing sequences in larger peptides are recognized with high affinity (Km less than 20 microM), the best yet discovered being VYP-isoD-HA, with a Km of 0.29 microM. Only two sequence elements have been found that can interfere with the high affinity binding of peptides of 4 or more residues, these being a prolyl residue in the isoD+1 position and negatively charged residues in the isoD+1, isoD+2, and/or isoD+3 positions. We investigated the effect of higher order structure on binding affinity using several L-isoaspartyl-containing proteins. Although conformation did, in some cases, lower the affinity of the methyltransferase for L-isoaspartyl residues, the range of kinetic constants for the methylation of these proteins was similar to that observed with the synthetic peptides. The L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl methyltransferase has been proposed to function in vivo to prevent the accumulation of L-isoaspartyl residues that arise spontaneously as proteins age. To examine whether such a mechanism is feasible given the wide range of substrate Km values observed in vitro, we set up a computer simulation to model the degradation and methylation reactions in aging human erythrocytes. Our results suggest that enough methyltransferase activity exists in these cells to significantly lower the expected number of L-isoaspartyl residues, even when these residues have millimolar Km values for methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2070550775,"Segments of protein that do not adopt a well-ordered conformation in the absence of DNA can still contribute to site-specific recognition of DNA. The first six residues (NH2-Ser1-Thr2-Lys3-Lys4-Lys5-Pro6-) of phage λ repressor are flexible but are important for site-specific binding. Low-temperature x-ray crystallography and codon-directed saturation mutagenesis were used to study the role of this segment. All of the functional sequences have the form [X]1-[X]2-[Lys or Arg]3-[Lys]4-[Lys or Arg]5-[X]6. A high-resolution (1.8 angstrom) crystal structure shows that Lys3 and Lys4 each make multiple hydrogen bonds with guanines and that Lys5 interacts with the phosphate backbone. The symmetry of the complex breaks down near the center of the site, and these results suggest a revision in the traditional alignment of the six λ operator sites."
https://openalex.org/W1555776210,"Activation of human platelets by diverse receptor-transduced signals is followed by an intracellular calcium increase. Calcium liberation from an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive compartment is recognized to be one of the prime events, followed by further mechanisms to amplify the signal. Among these, the formation of prostaglandin endoperoxides and thromboxane A2 are part of the self-amplificating activation system. Two inhibitors of intracellular Ca(2+)-ATPases, thapsigargin and 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone have been reported to deplete the intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-responsive stores. In human platelets with EGTA present, we found that these inhibitors of the microsomal Ca2+ sequestration generate quite different Ca2+ transients due to an inherent cyclooxygenase inhibition by the benzohydroquinone derivative compared to thapsigargin, and, therefore, only one-half of the fura-2 signal is generated. For a maximal calcium release, Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors depend on the self-amplification system involving thromboxane formation. Following the thapsigargin-induced [Ca2+]i transient, thrombin was unable to raise [Ca2+]i, indicating that thapsigargin mobilizes calcium from the thrombin-responsive store, as long as the self-amplifying system of platelets is intact. With the thromboxane receptor blocked, thapsigargin releases only one-half of the calcium, and, hence, thrombin was able to release additional calcium. Interestingly, in the converse experiment, thrombin did not prevent a raise of [Ca2+]i by thapsigargin at all, although applying thrombin a second time was without any effect. Therefore, we propose two calcium pools in human platelets: receptor activation transiently releases calcium from an inositol-sensitive pool including the thapsigargin-sensitive compartment, followed by reuptake within minutes. Sequestration occurs into the thapsigargin-sensitive compartment from where it can be released even when the endoperoxide/thromboxane receptor is blocked. Calcium release from both compartments allows the formation of thromboxane B2, but not if only the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor-sensitive pool is emptied. In the presence of a protonophor, a calcium accumulation in the Ca(2+)-ATPase-sensitive pool could be observed."
https://openalex.org/W1480342660,"A genomic clone containing the gene for the alpha 5 subunit of the human alpha 5 beta 1 integrin complex was isolated by screening a human genomic library with the previously described alpha 5 cDNA (Argraves, W. S., Suzuki, S., Arai, H., Thompson, K., Pierschbacher, M. D., and Ruoslahti, E. (1987) J. Cell Biol 105, 1183-1190). The alpha 5 gene 5'-flanking region lacks both TATA and CCAAT boxes, and it is located in a CpG island. This region was an active promoter in transfection assays using the HT-1080 cell line (fibrosarcoma), which expresses alpha 5, but was inactive in the Raji cell line (B cell), which does not express alpha 5. These results indicate that the alpha 5 gene 5'-flanking region acts as a promoter that exhibits the expected cell-type specificity. Deletion of alpha 5 promoter sequences from position -657 to -178 caused transcription stimulation, suggesting that a silencer is located between these sites. Successive 5' deletions from position -178 decreased promoter activity until activity was essentially eliminated on deletion to position -27. Isolation of a functional promoter for the alpha 5 gene is a first step in understanding how expression of this gene is controlled at the molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1573563239,"The mechanisms by which calcium (Ca2+) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulate into matrix vesicles (MV) have not been elucidated. In the present study the characteristics of Pi uptake into MV isolated from mildly rachitic chicken growth plate cartilage have been investigated. The results indicate that Pi accumulates into MV mainly via a Na(+)-dependent Pi transport system. In the absence of NaCl in the extravesicular medium, Pi uptake was a nonsaturable process. In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the initial rate of Pi uptake was 4.38 +/- 1.02-fold higher than with 150 mM choline chloride (mean +/- S.E., n = 8, p less than 0.005). Other cations showed partial activity to drive Pi into MV as compared to Na+:Li+ (64.4%) greater than K+ (39.8%) greater than choline (39.0%) greater than tetramethylammonium (30.0%) greater than N-methylglucamine (26.3%). Na(+)-dependent Pi transport activity displayed saturability towards increasing extra-vesicular concentrations of Na+ and Pi. The apparent Km for Pi was 0.68 +/- 0.16 mM. The Na+ concentration producing half-maximum Pi transport activity was 106.2 +/- 11.0 mM. Kinetic analysis suggests that Na+ interacts with the Pi carrier with a stoichiometry of more than one Na+ ion with one Pi molecule. In MV isolated from normal chicken growth plate cartilage, this Na(+)-dependent Pi transport system was barely expressed. In contrast to the effect on Pi uptake by MV, the activity of alkaline phosphatase was not changed when NaCl was substituted for choline chloride in the assay medium. In addition to this observation which suggests that this enzyme is not related to the Pi transport activity described in this study, levamisole, which inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity did not affect the Na(+)-dependent uptake of Pi. Both arsenate and phosphonoformic acid, two inhibitors of the epithelial Na(+)-dependent Pi transport systems, were active inhibitors of the Na(+)-dependent Pi uptake by MV with a higher potency for phosphonoformic acid. Associated with the expression of a facilitated Na(+)-coupled Pi transport in MV, in vitro calcification assessed by 45Ca2+ uptake also showed a marked dependence on extravesicular sodium. This relationship was markedly attenuated in MV isolated from normal chicken growth plate cartilage expressing a weak Na(+)-facilitated Pi transport activity. In conclusion, a saturable Na(+)-dependent Pi carrier has been characterized which facilitates Pi transport in MV. Its potential role for Ca-Pi accumulation into MV and subsequent development of vesicular calcification followed by mineralization of the osteogenic matrix is proposed and remains to be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1529736497,"By cloning the cDNA coding for the membrane associated actin-binding protein p24, we identified a repetitive sequence motif consisting of the amino acids Gly, Tyr, Pro, Gln which is characteristic for a gene family in Dictyostelium discoideum. Using a cDNA probe corresponding to this motif, we isolated cDNA clones coding for a protein of the annexin family. On the basis of a long NH2-terminal sequence encompassing the Gly/Tyr/Pro/Gln motifs, the Dictyostelium annexin was identified as a homolog of vertebrate annexin VII (synexin). The mRNA coding for the Dictyostelium annexin VII has a size of 1.6 kilobases and is present during all developmental stages. Annexin VII is coded for by a single gene in Dictyostelium. A mutant deficient in annexin VII was isolated using a vector which carried the amino-terminal third of the Dictyostelium annexin VII cDNA followed by a viral epitope specific for a monoclonal antibody and a stop codon. Using this approach, homologous recombination in the annexin VII gene led to an expression of the viral epitope under the control of the endogenous annexin VII promoter. Lack of annexin VII is not a lethal event for D. discoideum, and the cells are able to undergo development on agar plates."
https://openalex.org/W1559098261,"It was proposed that human interferon omega (omega) binds to the interferon alpha/beta receptor but not to the interferon gamma receptor. However, since no studies were performed to provide direct evidence for this hypothesis, we carried out cross-linking experiments and saturation binding assays between a 32P-labeled human interferon-alpha (Hu-IFN-alpha) and unlabeled Hu-IFN-alpha A, -beta, -gamma, and -omega. These assays demonstrated that Hu-IFN-alpha A, -beta, and -omega, but not Hu-IFN-gamma, were able to block binding of 32P-labeled Hu-IFN-alpha A to human cells. These results indicate that Hu-IFN-omega binds to the alpha/beta receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1550218545,"The ability of hsp70 isoenzymes from wild-type and mutant yeast strains to uncoat bovine brain coated vesicles was analyzed and compared with that of the brain uncoating ATPase. Results show that, among the four major cytoplasmic isoenzymes produced in wild-type yeast, almost all of the activity is associated with the SSA1 and SSA2 isoenzymes. The SSB1 and SSB2 isoenzymes have almost no uncoating activity and are not found in the clathrin-hsp70 complexes formed during the uncoating reaction. Using hsp70 mutant yeast strains we find a marked difference in uncoating activity between the SSA1 and SSA2 isoenzymes, although there is only a 3% difference between their amino acid sequences. The SSA4 isoenzyme, which is produced only under stress conditions, has an uncoating activity intermediate between SSA1 and SSA2. These results suggest that the ability of hsp70 isoenzymes to uncoat clathrin-coated vesicles is restricted to certain members of the hsp70 family and can be affected by subtle changes in amino acid sequence. We also investigated the uncoating activity of mixtures of isoenzymes and find that the isoenzyme with lower uncoating activity reduces the activity of the isoenzyme with higher uncoating activity possibly by occupying binding sites on coated vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1582868418,"Site-specific analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation in rat pheochromocytoma led previously to the identification of a novel growth factor-sensitive serine/threonine protein kinase, designated proline-directed protein kinase (PDPK). In this article we describe further the activation, purification, subunit configuration, and biochemical characteristics of this cytoplasmic enzyme system. In human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells PDPK activity was found to be stimulated by epidermal growth factor in a dose-dependent, time-dependent manner. The PDPK purified from the cytosol of mouse FM3A mammary carcinoma cells exhibited the same chromatographic behavior and biochemical properties as the tyrosine hydroxylase-associated enzyme purified originally from rat pheochromocytoma. The presence of p34cdc2 was ultimately detected in all active fractions of highly purified PDPK by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation; however, it was determined that this catalytic subunit is complexed with a 58-kDa regulatory subunit that is clearly distinct from that of the growth-associated M phase-specific histone H1 kinase (i.e. cyclin B). The 58 kDa regulatory subunit of PDPK was identified by direct immunoblotting as a mammalian A-type cyclin. Furthermore, the p58cyclin A subunit of PDPK was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo and in vitro, the latter of which resulted in a significant increase in PDPK activity. Additional distinctions between this growth factor-sensitive PDPK (p34cdc2-p58cyclin A) and the M phase-specific histone H1 kinase (p34cdc2-p62cyclin B-p13suc1) are identified on the basis of chromatographic behavior, enzyme kinetics, and physicochemical properties. Based on these findings, it is proposed that PDPK represents a unique complex of the p34cdc2 protein kinase which is active in the cytoplasm of proliferative cells, is regulated differently from the M phase-specific histone H1 kinase by phosphorylation reactions, and is modulated selectively by growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1571213167,"This report demonstrates that specific proteolysis of brain spectrin by a calcium-dependent protease, calpain I, abolishes association of brain spectrin with the ankyrin-independent binding site(s) in brain membranes. Calpain I cleaves the beta subunit of spectrin at the N-terminal end leaving a 218-kDa fragment and cleaves the alpha subunit in the midregion to produce 150- and 130-kDa fragments. Calpain-proteolyzed spectrin almost completely loses the capacity to displace binding of intact spectrin to membranes. Spectrin digested by calpain I under conditions that almost completely destroyed membrane-binding remained associated as a tetramer and retained about 60% of the ability to associate with actin filaments. Cleavage of spectrin occurred at sites distinct from the membrane-binding site which is located on the beta subunit since the isolated 218-kDa fragment of the beta subunit as well as a reconstituted complex of alpha and 218-kDa beta subunit fragment partially regained binding activity. Moreover, cleavage of the alpha subunit alone reduced the affinity of spectrin for membranes by 2-fold. A consequence of distinct sites for calpain I cleavage and membrane-binding is that calpain I can digest spectrin while spectrin is complexed with other proteins and therefore has the potential to mediate disassembly of a spectrin-actin network from membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1561646380,"Site-specific mutagenesis was used to investigate the functional roles of amino acids in the relatively hydrophobic sequence Ile-Thr-Thr-Cys-Leu-Ala-320, located at the M4S4 boundary of the sarcomplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. Each of the residues was replaced with either a less hydrophogic, a polar, or a charged residue. Mutants Ile-315----Arg and Leu-319----Arg were devoid of any Ca2+ transport function or ATPase activity, while the mutant Thr-317----Asp retained about 5 and 7% of the wild-type Ca2+ transport and ATPase activities, respectively. These three mutants were able to form the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) by reaction with ATP, but this intermediate decayed very slowly to the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E2P). In the mutants Ile-315----Arg and Leu-319----Arg, the level of E2P formed in the backward reaction with inorganic phosphate was extremely low, but hydrolysis of E2P occurred at a normal rate. These mutants, in addition, displayed a higher apparent affinity for Ca2+ than the wild-type enzyme. In the mutants Ile-315----Ser and Ile-315----Asp, the Ca2+ transport and ATPase activities were moderately reduced to 30-40% of the wild-type activities, but normal affinities for Ca2+, Pi, and ATP were retained, as was the low affinity modulatory effect of ATP. Mutation of Thr-316 to Asp, Thr-317 to Ala, Cys-318 to Ala and Ala-320 to Arg had little or no effect on Ca2+ transport or ATPase activities. Introduction of two negative and one positive charge by triple mutation of the Ile-Thr-Thr-317 sequence created a mutant enzyme that, although completely inactive, was inserted into the membrane, consistent with a location of these residues on the cytoplasmic side of the M4S4 interface. Our findings suggest that the amphipathic character of the S4 helix and/or the distribution of charges in S4 is important for the stability of the E2P intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1496135030,"Molecular genetic experiments have suggested that the carboxyl terminus of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase is an inhibitory domain involved the in vivo regulation of the enzyme by glucose metabolism. An antibody prepared against a fusion protein including the last 59 amino acids of the ATPase sequence has been affinity purified to yield a preparation which requires the 18 carboxyl-terminal amino acids for recognition. Antibody binding experiments show that the carboxyl-terminal domain of the ATPase can be selectively exposed by concentrations of the detergent Tween-20 which do not break down the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane to the antibody. Both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrate that the accessibility of the carboxyl-terminal domain isolated plasma membranes depends on the physiological state of the cell being increased by glucose metabolism. Immunofluorescence analysis of isolated plasma membrane vesicles, using a dual labeling protocol with concanavalin A and antibody to reveal the orientation of individual vesicles, and colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy of ultrathin cryosections of whole yeast cells separately demonstrate that the ATPase carboxyl terminus is located the cytoplasmic compartment. The application of a mutant deleted of the epitope(s) recognized by the affinity purified carboxyl-terminal antibody eliminates the possibility of artifacts arising from nonspecific antibody binding. The accessibility properties and cytoplasmic location of the carboxyl-terminal domain appear to be consistent with its role as a negative regulator of the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1587270388,"The acidosome, a newly described organelle in Dictyostelium discoideum, is rich in vacuolar proton pumps (V-H(+)-ATPases) and is responsible for the acidification of endocytic vacuoles. Purified acidosomes were not significantly contaminated by lysosomes, endosomes, or plasma membranes but contained a small fraction of contractile vacuole markers. The specific activity of the proton pump in these acidosomes reached 30 mumol/min/mg protein, the highest yet reported for any V-H(+)-ATPase. The V-H(+)-ATPase was the predominant protein in acidosomes. Based on gel electrophoresis and densitometry, its 8 polypeptides had the following apparent molecular mass (in kDa) and stoichiometry: 90(1), 68(3), 53(3), 42(1), 37(3), 25(3), 17(6), and 15(1). These values suggested a Mr congruent to 8 x 10(5), consistent with the hydrodynamic properties and electron microscopic image of the purified pump. The 90- and 17-kDa polypeptides were integral, while the others were peripheral; only the 90-kDa subunit was biosynthetically labeled by [3H]glucosamine and 35SO4. The specific content of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in the acidosomes was the highest of any subcellular fraction tested, while sterols and sphingolipids were the lowest. Acidosomes had congruent to 10% of the lipid biosynthetically labeled with [3H]glucosamine. This organelle contributed 5% of cellular protein and 15% of the phospholipid in stationary cultures. We conclude that the acidosome in Dictyostelium is a biochemically discrete organelle, produced by the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus but distinct from other endomembranes as well as from the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1580041996,"Using internal and 5' deletions, the elements contributing to the in vitro activity of the human c-fos promoter have been identified. Wild type and mutant promoters were fused to the G-free cassette and tested, using HeLa nuclear and whole cell extracts, with the fos wild type promoter as the internal control. The proximal promoter domain, spanning from -124 to -58 in the fos promoter, is the primary determinant of activity. Two elements in this domain are important, the direct repeats and the -60 element, which contains overlapping MLTF/USF and CREB/ATF transcription factor binding sites. CREB/ATF appears to be dominant, since a canonical CRE functions well in place of the -60 element. Interestingly, the direct repeats appear to require the -60 element to exert their effect. Upstream elements do not Influence promoter activity in their normal position or adjacent to the TATA box, except the serum response element (SRE). Templates containing various lengths of the fos wild type SRE next to the TATA box are stimulated by adding purified serum response factor (SRF), while SRE mutants are not responsive. The stimulation is independent of small spacing differences between the SRE and TATA elements, and the CArG core of the fos SRE suffices to respond to added SRF in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1604033113,"We present evidence that CRE-BP1 binding to the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element (CRE) is a transcriptional activator. Transcriptional activation was assayed by cotransfection into CV-1 cells of a CRE-BP1 expression plasmid together with a reporter plasmid in which the thymidine kinase promoter and four tandem repeats of CRE were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Cotransfection with the CRE-BP1 expression plasmid caused an 8-fold stimulation of CAT activity, while cotransfection with the plasmids to express CRE-BP1 and c-Jun induced a 32-fold stimulation of CAT activity, suggesting that a heterodimer of CRE-BP1 with c-Jun is a stronger trans-activator than a homodimer of CRE-BP1. By using a series of deletion and point mutants of CRE-BP1 in this cotransfection assay, two functional domains of CRE-BP1 were identified: the putative metal finger structure in the amino-terminal region and the leucine zipper motif linked to a cluster of basic amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region. The former was a transcriptional activation domain in the absence of c-Jun. The latter was a DNA-binding domain, and was essential in both the presence and absence of c-Jun."
https://openalex.org/W1496015702,"Abstract Equilibrium dialysis measurements of adenine nucleotide binding to chloroplast coupling factor 1 suggest that the enzyme has six binding sites for ADP, adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), and 2'(3')-O-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP). High affinity binding at all six sites requires the divalent cation, Mg2+. Three of the nucleotide-binding sites, sites 1, 2, and 3, have been mapped by fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance measurements (see McCarty, R. E., and Hammes, G. G. (1987) Trends Biochem. Sci. 12, 234-237). Using the same technique, we mapped the location of nucleotide-binding site 4, a tight, exchangeable site (Shapiro, A. B., Huber, A. H., and McCarty, R. E. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 4194-4200). Two arrangements of the energy transfer map of coupling factor 1 were found which are compatible with the available data. The two arrangements make different predictions about which sites interact in cooperative catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1543540171,"A large number of diverse cell surface proteins are anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. One proposed function for the GPI anchor is that it facilitates the release of the protein from the cell by acting as a target for anchor-specific phospholipases. We and others have discovered that mammalian plasma contains a GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) (Cardoso de Almeida, M. L., Turner, M. J., Stambuk, B. V., and Schenkman, S. (1988) Biochem, Biophys. Res. Commun. 150, 476-482; Davitz, M. A., Hereld, D., Shak, S., Krakow, J., Englund, P. T., and Nussenzweig, V. (1987) Science 238, 81-84; Low, M. G., and Prasad, A. R. S. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 85, 980-984). Because the GPI-PLD recognizes a conserved portion of the anchor, all GPI-anchored proteins are potential substrates for the enzyme. We demonstrate in this communication the production of the plasma GPI-PLD by the islets of Langerhans. GPI-PLD enzymatic activity was found in dog pancreatic microsomes, but not pancreatic juice. Both the pancreatic and plasma enzymes were divalent cation-dependent and had identical substrate specificities. Purified murine islets of Langerhans, as well as alpha and beta cells, contained and released GPI-PLD activity. A GPI-PLD DNA fragment was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a normal human islet cDNA library; the amplified fragment hybridized with the GPI-PLD cDNA clone. These findings represent the first demonstration of the production of the plasma GPI-PLD by a specific tissue site as well as cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1578984770,"Abstract Treatment of a solution of actin and smooth muscle caldesmon with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) results in the formation of a disulfide cross-link between the C-terminal penultimate residue Cys-374 of actin and Cys-580 in caldesmon's C-terminal actin-binding region. Therefore, these 2 residues are close in the actin-caldesmon complex. Since myosin also binds to actin in the vicinity of Cys-374 and since caldesmon inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity by the reduction of myosin binding to actin, then the inhibition might be by caldesmon sterically hindering or blocking myosin's interaction with actin. [Ca2+]Calmodulin, which reverses the inhibition of the ATPase activity, decreases the yield of the cross-linked species, suggesting a weakening of the caldesmon-actin interaction in the cross-linked region. It is possible to maximally cross-link one caldesmon molecule/every three actin monomers, in the absence or presence of tropomyosin, clearly ruling out an elongated, end-to-end alignment of caldesmon on the actin filament in vitro, and raising the possibility that the N-terminal part of caldesmon projects out from the filament. Reaction of 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-modified actin with caldesmon leads to the same disulfide cross-linked product between actin and caldesmon Cys-580, enabling the specific labeling of the other caldesmon cysteine, residue 153, in the N-terminal part of caldesmon with a spectroscopic probe."
https://openalex.org/W2136431995,"The pma2 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe codes for a polypeptide having a predicted M(r) of 110,126 and which is 79% identical to the plasma membrane H+-ATPase encoded by the pma1 gene. The pma2 gene, unlike pma1, is weakly expressed and not essential to mitotic growth. By constructing yeast strains in which the chromosomal pma2 gene is under control of the adh promoter, it has been possible to identify the over-produced ATPase in plasma membrane via formation of a phosphoenzyme. In a pma1-1 mutant strain whose ATPase activity is insensitive to vanadate, the over-expressed pma2 gene restores vanadate sensitivity. It also rescues a pma1 null mutant from lethality. These results demonstrate that the two H+-ATPases are functionally interchangeable in vivo but differently expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1581077386,"Actin has been found to bind to plasmin's kringle regions, thereby inhibiting its enzymatic activity in a noncompetitive manner. We, therefore, examined its effect upon the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator. Actin stimulated plasmin generation from both Glu- and Lys-plasminogen, lowering the Km for activation of Glu-plasminogen into the low micromolar range. Accelerated plasmin generation did not occur in the presence of epsilon-amino caproic acid or if actin was exposed to acetic anhydride, an agent known to acetylate lysine residues. Actin binds to tissue plasminogen activator (t-Pa) (Kd = 0.55 microM), at least partially via lysine-binding sites. Actin's stimulation of plasmin generation from Glu-plasminogen was inhibited by the addition of aprotinin and was restored by the substitution of plasmin-treated actin, indicating the operation of a plasmin-dependent positive feedback mechanism. Native actin binds to Lys-plasminogen, and promotes its conversion to plasmin even in the presence of aprotinin, indicating that plasmin's cleavage of either actin or plasminogen leads to further plasmin generation. Plasmin-treated actin binds Glu-plasminogen and t-PA simultaneously, thereby raising the local concentration of t-PA and plasminogen. Together, but not separately, actin and t-PA prolong the thrombin time of plasma through the generation of plasmin and fibrinogen degradation products. Actin-stimulated plasmin generation may be responsible for some of the changes found in peripheral blood following tissue injury and sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W1600078585,"The ratio between Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-dependent ATP hydrolysis measured in sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles of rabbit skeletal muscle was found to vary greatly depending on the concentrations of oxalate or Pi used. In the presence of 5 mM oxalate, 20 mM Pi, and 1 mM Pi, the ratios found were in the range of 1.4-2.3, 0.6-0.8, and 0.01-0.10, respectively. The rates of Ca2+ exchange and ATP synthesis were measured at the steady state by adding trace amounts of 45Ca and 32Pi, after the vesicles had been loaded with Ca2+. In the presence of 1 mM Pi, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM CaCl2, the ratio between Ca2+ exchange and ATP synthesis varied from 9 to 14. This ratio approached two when Ca2+ in the medium was reduced to a very low level, or when in the presence of Ca2+, dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the assay medium, or when the Pi concentration was raised from 1 to 20 mM. A ratio of two was also measured when the steady state was attained using ITP instead of ATP. In all the conditions that led to a ratio close to two, there was an increase in the fraction of enzyme phosphorylated by Pi. It is proposed that the coupling between Ca2+ translocation and ATP hydrolysis or synthesis is modulated by the phosphorylation of the ATPase by Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1651393138,"We have isolated cDNAs encoding annexin II (calpactin I) heavy chain homologues from a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library. Two of the clones are full length, while two appear to be derived from incompletely spliced mRNAs. The 1230- and 1240-base pair full length clones are 99% identical, and both have 84 bases of 5'-untranslated sequence, 1020-base open reading frames, and either 126- or 136-base 3'-untranslated domains. Northern blots show a 1.4-kilobase (kb) annexin II heavy chain transcript throughout oogenesis and in mature eggs. Xenopus annexin II mRNA levels are constant during early embryogenesis, but decrease at 8 h. After midblastula transition, the steady state level of the 1.4-kb transcript increases substantially, and a 3.3-kb transcript appears. Adult brain, heart, striated muscle, and liver contain moderate amounts of the 1.4-kb transcript, while skin has the 3.3-kb transcript and very high levels of the 1.4-kb transcript. Synthetic mRNA derived from the Xenopus annexin II cDNAs directs the synthesis of an apparent Mr = 36,500 polypeptide when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes. The predicted 339-amino acid protein products are 80% identical with murine annexin II heavy chain. Most of the differences are concentrated in the amino end from residues 15 to 24. The Xenopus annexin II heavy chain lacks the highly conserved tyrosine at position 23 which is the site of src oncogene tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in the murine protein. These results demonstrate that Xenopus oocytes contain an annexin II (calpactin I) heavy chain mRNA with a distinct amino terminus and suggest that multiple annexin II isoforms may be expressed during amphibian embryogenesis and development."

The absence of processing at two sites in the atpE leader-sequence caused by the RNase E deficiency in E. coli host N3431 leads to a considerable stabilization of the mRNA moiety. RNase E has originally been described as a processing enzyme for non-mRNAs such as precursor 5 S rRNA and RNA1, but cleavage mRNA substrates have also been reported. RNase E processing of the atpE gene leader sequence-containing transcripts leads to an increased rate of mRNA breakdown. The two RNase E-dependent processing sites in the atpE part of the mRNA transcripts exhibit some similarity to the other known RNase E processing sites. The influence of RNase E cleavage upon post-transcriptional regulation such as RNA stability and the efficiency of translational initiation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1723095008,"We have identified three developmentally regulated oligosaccharide-processing enzyme activities in Dictyostelium discoideum. Two different alpha-mannosidase activities present at extremely low levels in vegetative cells are expressed during development. The first of these activities (MI) rises sharply from 6 to 12 h of development whereas the second activity (MII) rises sharply from 12 to 18 h of development. MI acts on Man9GlcNAc, which it can degrade to Man5GlcNAc but is inactive toward p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside (pnpMan). MII acts on pnpMan but not Man9GlcNAc. These activities are distinct from each other and from lysosomal alpha-mannosidase activity as demonstrated by pH optima, substrate specificity, sensitivity to inhibitors and divalent cations, developmental profiles, and solubility. The characteristics of these developmentally regulated alpha-mannosidase activities are similar to those of Golgi alpha-mannosidases I and II from higher eucaryotes, and they appear to catalyze the in vivo formation of processed asparagine-linked oligosaccharides by developed cells. In addition, developed cells have very low levels of a soluble alpha-mannosidase activity, which is the predominant activity in vegetative cells. This soluble vegetative alpha-mannosidase activity has properties that are reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum alpha-mannosidase from rat liver. The intersecting N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that we have described recently in vegetative cells of D. discoideum (Sharkey, D. J., and Kornfeld, R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 10411-10419) has a developmental profile that is distinct from that of either of the alpha-mannosidase activities. It has maximum activity at 6 h of development and decreases sharply to its minimum level by 12 h of development. The changes that occur in the levels of these three processing enzymes with development correlate well with the different arrays of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides found in early and late stages of development (Sharkey, D. J., and Kornfeld, R. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18485-18497)."
