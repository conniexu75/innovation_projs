https://openalex.org/W1994832107,"Initial observations by the Pioneer Venus magnetometer in the sunlit ionosphere reveal a dynamic ionosphere, very responsive to external solar wind conditions. The locations of the bow shock and ionosphere are variable. The strength of the magnetic field just outside the ionopause is in approximate pressure balance with the thermal plasma of the ionosphere and changes markedly from day to day in response to changes in solar wind pressure. The field strength in the ionosphere is also variable from day to day. The field is often weak, at most a few gammas, but reaching many tens of gammas for periods of the order of seconds. These field enchantments are interpreted as due to the passage of spacecraft through flux ropes consisting of bundles of twisted field lines surrounded by the ionospheric plasma. The helicity of the flux varies through the flux tube, with low pitch angles on the inside and very large angles in the low-field outer edges of the ropes. These ropes may have external or internal sources. Consistent with previous results, the average position of the bow shock is much closer to the planet than would be expected if the solar wind were completely deflected by the planet. In total, these observations indicate that the solar wind plays a significant role in the physics of the Venus ionosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2094555890,"Ultraviolet spectroscopy of the Venus cloud tops reveals absorption features attributed to sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere above the cloud tops. Measurements of scattered sunlight at 2663 angstroms show evidence for horizontal and vertical inhomogeneities in cloud structure. Images of the planet at SO(2) absorption wavelengths show albedo features similar to those seen at 3650 angstroms from Mariner 10. Airglowv emissions are consistent with an exospheric temperatuire of approximately 275 K, and a night airglows emission has been detected, indicating the precipitation of energy into the dark thermosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2067901928,"The first gas chromatographic analysis of the lower atmosphere of Venus is reported. Three atmospheric samples were analyzed. The third of these samples showed carbon dioxide (96.4 percent), molecular nitrogen (3.41 percent), water vapor (0.135 percent), molecular oxygen [69.3 parts per million (ppm)], argon (18.6 ppm), neon (4.31 ppm), and sulfuir dioxide (186 ppm). The amounts of water vapor and sulfur dioxide detected are roughly compatible with the requirements of greenhouse models of the high surface temperature of Venus. The large positive gradient of sulfur dioxide, molecular oxygen, and water vapor from the clould tops to their bottoms, as implied by Earth-based observations and these resuilts, gives added support for the presence of major quantities of aqueous sulfuric acid in the clouds. A comparison of the inventory of inert gases found in the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars suggests that these components are due to outgassing from the planetary interiors."
https://openalex.org/W1990223529,"Thermal plasma quantities measured by the retarding potential analyzer (RPA) are, together with companion Pioneer Venus measurements, the first in situ measurements of the Venus ionosphere. High ionospheric ion and electron temperatures imply significant solar wind heating of the ionosphere. Comparison of the measured altitude profiles of the dominant ions with an initial model indicates that the ionosphere is close to diffusive equilibrium. The ionopause height was observed to vary from 400 to 1000 kilometers in early orbits. The ionospheric particle pressure at the ionopause is apparently balanced at a solar zenith angle of about 70° by the magnetic field pressure with little contribution from energetic solar wind particles. The measured ratio of ionospheric scale height to ionopause radius is consistent with that inferred from previously measured bow shock positions."
https://openalex.org/W2038963650,"Measurements in situ of the neutral composition and temperature of the thermosphere of Venus are being made with a quadrupole mass spectrometer on the Pioneer Venus orbiter. The presence of many gases, incluiding the major constituents CO(2), CO, N(2), O, and He has been confirmed. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant constituent at altitudes below about 155 kilometers in the terminator region. Above this altitude atomic oxygen is the major constituent, with O/CO(2) ratios in the upper atmosphere being greater than was commonly expected. Isotope ratios of O and C are close to terrestrial values. The temperature inferred from scale heights above 180 kilometers is about 400 K on the dayside near the evening terminator at a solar zenith angle of about 69 degrees . It decreases to about 230 K when the solar zenith angle is about 90 degrees ."
https://openalex.org/W2077925875,"Altitude profiles of electron temperature and density in the ionosphere of Venus have been obtained by the Pioneer Venus orbiter electron temperature probe. Elevated temperatures observed at times of low solar wind flux exhibit height profiles that are consistent with a model in which less than 5 percent of the solar wind energy is deposited at the ionopause and is conducted downward through an unmagnetized ionosphere to the region below 200 kilometers where electron cooling to the neutral atmosphere proceeds rapidly. When solar wind fluxes are higher, the electron temperatures and densities are highly structured and the ionopause moves to lower altitudes. The ionopause height in the late afternoon sector observed thus far varies so widely from day to day that any height variation with solar zenith angle is not apparent in the observations. In the neighborhood of the ionopause, measurements of plasma temperatures and densities and magnetic field strength indicate that an induced magnetic barrier plays an important role in the pressure transfer between the solar wind and the ionosphere. The bow shock is marked by a distinct increase in electron current collected by the instrument, a feature that provides a convenient identification of the bow shock location."
https://openalex.org/W2011016324,"Data from the Pioneer Venus cloud particle size spectrometer experiment has revealed the Venus cloud system to be a complicated mixture of particles of various chemical composition distinguishable by their multimodal size distributions. The appearance, disappearance, growth, and decay of certain size modes has aided the preliminary identification of both sulfuric acid and free sulfur cloud regions. The discovery of large particles > 30 micrometers, significant particle mass loading, and size spectral features suggest that precipitation is likely produced; a peculiar aerosol structure beneath the lowest cloud layer could be residue from a recent shower."
https://openalex.org/W2005262363,"The neutral mass spectrometer on board the Pioneer Venus multiprobe bus measured composition and structural parameters of the dayside Venus upper atmosphere on 9 December 1978. Carbon dioxide and helium number densities were 6 × 109 and 5 × 106 per cubic centimeter, respectively, at an altitude of 150 kilometers. The mixing ratios of both argon-36 and argon-40 were approximately 80 parts per million at an altitude of 135 kilometers. The exospheric temperature from 160 to 170 kilometers was 285 ± 10 K. The helium homopause was found at an altitude of about 137 kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2053621448,"The first in situ measurements of the composition of the ionosphere of Venus are provided by independent Bennett radio-frequency ion mass spectrometers on the Pioneer Venus bits and orbiter spacecraft, exploring the dawn and duskside regions, respectively. An extensive composition of ion species, rich in oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon chemistry is idenitified. The dominant topside ion is O(+), with C(+), N(+), H(+), and He(+) as prominent secondary ions. In the lower ionosphere, the ionzization peak or F(1) layer near 150 kilometers reaches a concentration of about 5 x l0(3) ions per cubic centimeter, and is composed of the dominant molecular ion, O(2)(+), with NO(+), CO(+), and CO(2)(+), constituting less than 10 percent of the total. Below the O(+) peak near 200 kilometers, the ions exhibit scale heights consistent with a neutral gas temperature of about 180 K near the terminator. In the upper ionosphere, scale heights of all species reflect the effects of plasma transport, which lifts the composition upward to the often abrupt ionopause, or thermal ion boundary, which is observed to vary in height between 250 to 1800 kilometers, in response to solar wind dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W1980105438,"Fourteen profiles of electron density in the ionosphere of Venus were obtainecd by the dual-frequency radio occulation method with the Pioneer Venus orbiter between 5 and 30 December 1978. The solar zenith angles for these measurements were between about 85 degrees and 92 degrees , and the latitudes ranged from about 81 degrees to 88 degrees (ecliptic north). In addition to the expected decreasein peak electron density from about 1.5 x 10(3) to 0.5 x 10(3) per cubic centimeter with increasing solar zenith angle, a region of almost constant electron density above about 250 kilometers was observed. The ionopause height varies from about 300 to 700 kilometers and seems to be influenced by diurnal changes in solar wind conditions. The structures of the profiles are consistent with models in which O(2)(+) dominates near the ionization peak and is replaced by O(+) at higher altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2071141922,"The failure to synthesize superheavy elements by using complete fusion reactions is most likely understandable in terms of the low survival probabilities of the superheavy precursors formed in these reactions or (in some cases) the failure to achieve complete fusion. Further attempts to synthesize these elements by using complete fusion or deep inelastic transfer reactions, or both, are discussed in light of these results."
https://openalex.org/W2031257414,"The first polarization measurements of the orbiter cloud photopolarimeter have detected a planet-wide layer of submicrometer aerosols of substantial visible optical thickness, of the order of 0.05 to 0.1, in the lower stratosphere well above the main visible sulfuric acid cloud layer. Early images show a number of features observed by Mariner 10 in 1974, including planetary scale markings that propagate around the planet in the retrograde sense at roughly 100 meters per second and bright- and dark-rimmed cells suggesting convective activity at low latitudes. The polar regions are covered by bright clouds down to latitudes aproximately 50 degrees, with both caps significantly brighter (relative to low latitudes) than the south polar cloud observed by Mariner 10. The cellular features, often organized into clusters with large horizontal scale, exist also at mid-latitudes, and include at least one case in which a cell cuts across the edge of the bright polar cloud of the northern hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2019031148,"The Pioneer Venus electric field detector observes significant effects of the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere of Venus all along the orbiter trajectory. Information is obtained on plasma oscillations emitted by suprathermal electrons beyond the bows shock, on sharp and diffuse shock structures, and on waveparticle interaction phenomena that are important near the boundary of the dayside ionosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2019038985,"Bennett radio-frequency ion mass spectrometers have returned the first in situ measurements of the Venus dayside ion composition, including evidence of pronounced structural variability resulting from a dynamic interaction with the solar wind. The ionospheric envelope, dominated above 200 kilometers by O(+), responds dramatically to variations in the solar wind pressure, Which is observed to compress the thermal ion distributions from heights as great as 1800 kilometers inward to 280 kilometers. At the thermal ion boundary, or ionopause, the ambient ions are swept away by the solar wind, such that a zone of accelerated suprathermnal plasma is encountered. At higher altitudes, extending outward on some orbits for thousands of kilometers to the bows shock, energetic ion currents are detected, apparently originating from the shocked solar wind plasma. Within the ionosphere, observations of pass-to-pass differences in the ion scale heights are indicative of the effects of ion convection stimlulated by the solar wind interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1992211059,"This report is an introduction to the accompanying collection of initial results from the successful Pioneer Venus orbiter and mutiprobe missions that encountered Venus on 4 December and 9 December 1978, respectively. The mission features are briefly described and furnish data accumulated over the first 30 days of the mission."
https://openalex.org/W2007445361,"Orbiter infrared measurements of the Venus atmosphere in the 60- to 140-kilometer region show very small diurnal temperature differences near the cloud tops, increasing somewhat at higher levels. The seasonal (that is, equator to pole) contrasts are an order of magnitude larger, and the temperatures unexpectedly increase with increasing latitude below 80 kilometers. An isothermal layer at least two scale heights in vertical extent is found near the 100-kilometer altitude, where the temperature is about 175 K. Structure is present in the cloud temperature maps on a range of spatial scales. The most striking is at high latitude, where contrasts of nearly 50 K are observed between a cold circumpolar band and the region near the pole itself."
https://openalex.org/W2075743291,"Initial examination of data from the neutral mass spectrometer on the Pioneer Venus sounder probe indicates that the abundances of argon-36, argon-38, and neon-20 in the Venus atmosphere are much higher than those of the corresponding gases in Earth's atmosphere, although the abundance of radiogenic argon-40 is apparently similar for both planets. The lower atmosphere of Venus includes significant concentrations of various gaseous sulfur compounds. The inlet leak to the mass spectrometer was temporarily blocked by an apparently liquid component of the Venus clouds during passage through the dense cloud layer. Analysis of gases released during the evaporation of the droplets shows the presence of water vapor to some compound or compounds of sulfur."
https://openalex.org/W2029688860,"Preliminary results of the nephelometer experiments conducted aboard the large sounder, day, north, and night probes of the Pioneer Venus mission are presented. The vertical structures of the Venus clouds observed simultaneously at each of the four locations from altitudes of from 63 kilometers to the surface are compared, and similarities and differences are noted. Tentative results from attempting to use the data from the nephelometer and cloud particle size spectrometer on the sounder probe to identify the indices of refraction of cloud particles in various regions of the Venus clouds are reported. Finally the nephelometer readings for the day probe during impact on the surface of Venus are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2055979768,"Initial results of observations of the solar wind interaction with Venus indicate that Venus has a well-defined, strong, standing bow shock wave. Downstream from the shock, an ionosheath is observed in which the compressed and heated postshock plasma evidently interacts directly with the Venus ionosphere. Plasma ion velocity deflections observed within the ionosheath are consistent with flow around the blunt shape of the ionopause. The ionopause boundary is observed and defined by this experiment as the location where the ionosheath ion flow is first excluded. The positions of the bow shock and ionopause are variable and appear to respond to changes in the external solar wind pressure. Near the terminator the bow shock was observed at altitudes of approximately 4600 to approximately 12,000 kilometers. The ionopause altitutde ranged fromn as low as approximately 450 to approximately 1950 kilometers. Within the Venus ionosphere low-energy ions (energy per untit charge < 30 volts) were detected and have been tentatively idtentified as nonflowing ionospheric ions incident from a direction along the spacecraft velocity vector."
https://openalex.org/W2012899577,"The four Pioneer Venus entry probes transmitted data of good quality on the structure of the atmosphere below the clouds. Contrast of the structure below an altitude of 50 kilometers at four widely separated locations was found to be no more than a few degrees Kelvin, with slightly warmer temperatures at 30 degrees south latitude than at 5 degrees or 60 degrees north. The atmosphere was stably stratified above 15 or 20 kilometers, indicating that the near-adiabatic state is maintained by the general circulation. The profiles move from near-adiabatic toward radiative equilibrium at altitudes above 40 kilometers. There appears to be a region of vertical convection above the dense cloud deck, which lies at 47.5 to 49 kilometers and at temperature levels near 360 K. The atmosphere is nearly isothermal around 100 kilometers (175 to 180 K) and appears to exhibit a sizable temperature wave between 60 and 70 kilometers. This is where the 4-day wind is believed to occur. The temperature wave may be related to some of the wavelike phenomena seen in Mariner 10 ultraviolet photographs."
https://openalex.org/W2026824571,"Atmospheric drag measurements obtained from the study of the orbital decay of Pioneer Venus 1 indicate that atomic oxygen predominates in the Venus atmosphere above 160 kilometers. Drag measurements give evidence that conditions characteristic of a planetary thermosphere disappear near sundown, with inferred exospheric temperatures sharply dropping from approximately 300 K to less than 150 K. Observed denisities are generally lower than given by theoretical models."
https://openalex.org/W1995345894,"During the descent to the surface of Venus, the large probe infrared radiometer measured the net thermal radiative flux in several spectral bandpasses. Preliminary analysis has permitted us to estimate (i) the infrared extinction coefficient profile attributable to aerosols, with respect to their visible profile, in the upper atmosphere of Venus and (ii) the water vapor mixing ratio below the clouds. An indication of the composition of a multicomponent cloud is seen in the data from the spectral bandpass from 6 to 7 micrometers."
https://openalex.org/W1554512004,"In his essay, U. S. science writer Boyce Rensberger analyzes whether there is any truth behind the assertions that U. S. citizens are particularly ignorant about science and that the press is to blame for the high interest in pseudoscience. He concludes that many Americans are very interested in science, but cannot distinguish between good and bad science because they do not understand the standards that scientific evidence must meet. Rensberger urges scientists and science writers to pay more attention to the communication of the methods by which results have been achieved. See also the related essay by Roger Highfield."
https://openalex.org/W2030530480,"The solar flux radiometer aboard the Pioneer Venus large probe operated successfully during its descent through the atmosphere of Venus. Upward, downward, and net fluxes from 0.4 to 1.0 micrometers were obtained at more than 390 levels between 185 millibars (at an altitude of approximately 61 kilometers) and the surface. Fluxes from 0.4 to 1.8 micrometers were also obtained between 185 millibars and about the level at which the pressure was 2 atmospheres. Data from 80 to 185 millibars should be available after additional decoding by the Deep Space Network. Upward and downward intensities in a narrower band from 0.59 to 0.66 micrometers were also obtained throughout the descent in order to constrain cloud properties. The measurements indicate three cloud regions above the 1.3-atmosphere level (at an altitude of approximately 49 kilometers) and a clear atmosphere beneath that level. At the 67 degrees solar zenith of the probe entry site, some 15 watts per square meter are absorbed at the surface by a dark ground, which implies that about 2 percent of the solar energy incident on the planet is absorbed at the ground."
https://openalex.org/W2024518354,"Altimetry and radar scattering data for Venus, obtained from 10 of the first 13 orbits of the Pioneer Venus orbiter, have disclosed what appears to be a rift valley having vertical relief of up to 7 kilometers, as well as a neighboring, gently rolling plain. Planetary oblateness appears unlikely to exceed 1/2500 and may be substantially smaller."
https://openalex.org/W1589631065,"In this essay, Highfield reflects on his personal experiences as science journalist and editor at the British broadsheet the Daily Telegraph. Highfield believes that scientists can learn from journalists' dialogue approach to science communication. Highfield believes that readers are ""ignorant but smart,"" and are sufficiently sceptical not to believe all the hype that they read. What is most important is that a dialogue is created. For example, large-scale experiments performed by the Daily Telegraph together with the BBC allow the public to get a glimpse of the scientific method that is often ignored."
https://openalex.org/W2040634491,"An image of the infrared emission from the Earth-facing hemisphere of Venus was obtained at the time the Pioneer Venus probes penetrated the atmosphere. The thermal structure of the atmosphere at the 85-millibar level included regions of rapidly varying polar features, a solar-related postdawn warm area, and a nonsolar-fixed nighttime warm area. The probes succeeded in entering each of these three thermal regions."
https://openalex.org/W2083783334,"To determine the wind directions and speeds on Venus, as each Pioneer probe fell to the surface we tracked its motion in three dimensions using a combination of Doppler and long-baseline radio interferometric methods. Preliminary results from this tracking, coupled with results from test observations of other spacecraft, enable us to estimate the uncertainties of our eventual determinations of the velocity vectors of the probes with respect to Venus. For altitudes below about 65 kilometers and with time-averaging over 100-second intervals, all three components of the velocity should have errors of the order of 0.3 meter per second or less."
https://openalex.org/W2001493247,"Measurements of the changes in orbital period of the Pioneer Venus orbiter have yielded estimates of the density of the upper atmosphere of Venus at altitudes in the range from 150 to 200 kilometers. At the lower limit of this range, the density on the dayside of the terminator exhibits a temporal variation of amplitude near 4 × 10–14 gram per cubic centimeter about a mean of approximately 1.4 × 10–13 gram per cubic centimeter. The variation appears oscillatory, with a 4- to 5-day period, but barely one cycle was observed. The density on the nightside of the terminator, sampled in the same 150-kilometer altitude range, fluctuates about a smaller mean of approximately 4 × 10–14 gram per cubic centimeter. The density between the altitudes of 150 and 200 kilometers, sampled only on the dayside of the terminator, imply a scale height of between 15 and 20 kilometers. The interpretation of this estimate is uncertain, however, in view of the measurements at the different altitudes having been made at different times and, hence, at different values of solar phase."
https://openalex.org/W1483323452,"At the boundary between Earth's mantle and its core, physical properties such as density change dramatically. In their Perspective, Garnero and Jeanloz discuss the competing models of this boundary's structure. Distinguishing between the models will require more high-quality seismic data."
https://openalex.org/W1968149837,"A major motivation is to achieve in man-machine interactions the efficiency of speech communication among humans. Continuous speech is more difficult to understand than are isolated words. Commercially available speech recognition systems of the latter type are highly successful despite their limited capability. To recognize continuous speech, more information is needed than is contained in acoustic waves alone. The linguistic and contextual knowledge that must be supplied or programmed into a computer to accomplish speech interpretation is the subject of several research activities which are described. Speech synthesis systems face similar problems but are further advanced."
