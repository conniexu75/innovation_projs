https://openalex.org/W2785443776,"Regulatory variants are often context specific, modulating gene expression in a subset of possible cellular states. Although these genetic effects can play important roles in disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying context specificity are poorly understood. Here, we identified shared quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for chromatin accessibility and gene expression in human macrophages exposed to IFNγ, Salmonella and IFNγ plus Salmonella. We observed that ~60% of stimulus-specific expression QTLs with a detectable effect on chromatin altered the chromatin accessibility in naive cells, thus suggesting that they perturb enhancer priming. Such variants probably influence binding of cell-type-specific transcription factors, such as PU.1, which can then indirectly alter the binding of stimulus-specific transcription factors, such as NF-κB or STAT2. Thus, although chromatin accessibility assays are powerful for fine-mapping causal regulatory variants, detecting their downstream effects on gene expression will be challenging, requiring profiling of large numbers of stimulated cellular states and time points."

In a social affective preference text in which experimental adult male rats could interact with either naive or stressed conspecifics, the experimental rats either approached or avoided the stressed conspecific, depending upon the age of the conspecific. Specifically, experimental rats approached stressed juveniles but avoided stressed adults. Inhibition of insular cortex, which is implicated in social cognition, and blockade of insular oxytocin receptors disrupted the social affective behaviors. Oxytocin application increased intrinsic excitability and synaptic efficacy in acute insular cortex slices, and insular oxytocin administration recapitulated the behaviors observed toward stressed conspecifics. Network analysis of c-Fos immunoreactivity in 29 regions identified functional connectivity between insular cortex, prefrontal cortex, amygdala and the social decision-making network. These results implicate insular cortex as a key component in the circuit underlying age-dependent social responses to stressed conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W2788562722,"Amplification of the locus encoding the oncogenic transcription factor MYCN is a defining feature of high-risk neuroblastoma. Here we present the first dynamic chromatin and transcriptional landscape of MYCN perturbation in neuroblastoma. At oncogenic levels, MYCN associates with E-box binding motifs in an affinity-dependent manner, binding to strong canonical E-boxes at promoters and invading abundant weaker non-canonical E-boxes clustered at enhancers. Loss of MYCN leads to a global reduction in transcription, which is most pronounced at MYCN target genes with the greatest enhancer occupancy. These highly occupied MYCN target genes show tissue-specific expression and are linked to poor patient survival. The activity of genes with MYCN-occupied enhancers is dependent on the tissue-specific transcription factor TWIST1, which co-occupies enhancers with MYCN and is required for MYCN-dependent proliferation. These data implicate tissue-specific enhancers in defining often highly tumor-specific ‘MYC target gene signatures’ and identify disruption of the MYCN enhancer regulatory axis as a promising therapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma. This study investigates the effects of MYCN on the chromatin and transcriptional landscape of neuroblastoma. The authors find that, at oncogenic levels, MYCN binds to canonical E-boxes at promoters and invades enhancers, leading to transcriptional amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2794236847,"Human coronavirus (HCoV) is one of the most common causes of respiratory tract infection throughout the world. To investigate the epidemiological and genetic variation of HCoV in Guangzhou, south China, we collected totally 13048 throat and nasal swab specimens from adults and children with fever and acute upper respiratory infection symptoms in Gunazhou, south China between July 2010 and June 2015, and the epidemiological features of HCoV and its species were studied. Specimens were screened for HCoV by real-time RT-PCR, and 7 other common respiratory viruses were tested simultaneously by PCR or real-time PCR. HCoV was detected in 294 cases (2.25%) of the 13048 samples, with most of them inpatients (251 cases, 85.4% of HCoV positive cases) and young children not in nursery (53.06%, 156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases). Four HCoVs, as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected prevalent during 2010–2015 in Guangzhou, and among the HCoV positive cases, 60.20% were OC43, 16.67% were 229E, 14.97% were NL63 and 7.82% were HKU1. The month distribution showed that totally HCoV was prevalent in winter, but differences existed in different species. The 5 year distribution of HCoV showed a peak-valley distribution trend, with the detection rate higher in 2011 and 2013 whereas lower in 2010, 2012 and 2014. The age distribution revealed that children (especially those <3 years old) and old people (>50 years) were both high risk groups to be infected by HCoV. Of the 294 HCoV positive patients, 34.69% (101 cases) were co-infected by other common respiratory viruses, and influenza virus was the most common co-infecting virus (30/101, 29.70%). Fifteen HCoV-OC43 positive samples of 2013–2014 were selected for S gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, and the results showed that the 15 strains could be divided into 2 clusters in the phylogenetic tree, 12 strains of which formed a separate cluster that was closer to genotype G found in Malaysia. It was revealed for the first time that genotype B and genotype G of HCoV-OC43 co-circulated and the newly defined genotype G was epidemic as a dominant genotype during 2013–2014 in Guanzhou, south China."

https://openalex.org/W2785312775,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) action plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell function and survival; thus, it is considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in women. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of ERα remain unclear. Because ERα regulates mitochondrial metabolism in other cell types, we hypothesized that ERα may act to preserve insulin secretion and promote β-cell survival by regulating mitochondrial-endoplasmic reticulum (EndoRetic) function. We tested this hypothesis using pancreatic islet-specific ERα knockout (PERαKO) mice and Min6 β-cells in culture with Esr1 knockdown (KD). We found that Esr1-KD promoted reactive oxygen species production that associated with reduced fission/fusion dynamics and impaired mitophagy. Electron microscopy showed mitochondrial enlargement and a pro-fusion phenotype. Mitochondrial cristae and endoplasmic reticulum were dilated in Esr1-KD compared with ERα replete Min6 β-cells. Increased expression of Oma1 and Chop was paralleled by increased oxygen consumption and apoptosis susceptibility in ERα-KD cells. In contrast, ERα overexpression and ligand activation reduced both Chop and Oma1 expression, likely by ERα binding to consensus estrogen-response element sites in the Oma1 and Chop promoters. Together, our findings suggest that ERα promotes β-cell survival and insulin secretion through maintenance of mitochondrial fission/fusion-mitophagy dynamics and EndoRetic function, in part by Oma1 and Chop repression."
https://openalex.org/W2793680246,"Amino acids play numerous roles in the central nervous system, serving as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and regulators of energy metabolism. The free amino acid profile in serum of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients may be influenced by neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, malabsorption in the gastroenteric tract and received treatment. The aim of our study was the evaluation of the profile of amino acid concentrations against disease progression. We assessed the amino acid profile in the serum of 73 patients divided into groups with early PD, late PD with dyskinesia and late PD without dyskinesia. Serum amino acid analysis was performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. We observed some significant differences amongst the groups with respect to concentrations of alanine, arginine, phenylalanine and threonine, although no significant differences were observed between patients with advanced PD with and without dyskinesia. We conclude that this specific amino acid profile could serve as biochemical marker of PD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2785925704,"There is extensive laboratory research studying the effects of acute sleep deprivation on biological and cognitive functions, yet much less is known about naturalistic patterns of sleep loss and the potential impact on daily or weekly functioning of an individual. Longitudinal studies are needed to advance our understanding of relationships between naturalistic sleep and fluctuations in human health and performance, but it is first necessary to understand the efficacy of current tools for long-term sleep monitoring. The present study used wrist actigraphy and sleep log diaries to obtain daily measurements of sleep from 30 healthy adults for up to 16 consecutive weeks. We used non-parametric Bland-Altman analysis and correlation coefficients to calculate agreement between subjectively and objectively measured variables including sleep onset time, sleep offset time, sleep onset latency, number of awakenings, the amount of wake time after sleep onset, and total sleep time. We also examined compliance data on the submission of daily sleep logs according to the experimental protocol. Overall, we found strong agreement for sleep onset and sleep offset times, but relatively poor agreement for variables related to wakefulness including sleep onset latency, awakenings, and wake after sleep onset. Compliance tended to decrease significantly over time according to a linear function, but there were substantial individual differences in overall compliance rates. There were also individual differences in agreement that could be explained, in part, by differences in compliance. Individuals who were consistently more compliant over time also tended to show the best agreement and lower scores on behavioral avoidance scale (BIS). Our results provide evidence for convergent validity in measuring sleep onset and sleep offset with wrist actigraphy and sleep logs, and we conclude by proposing an analysis method to mitigate the impact of non-compliance and measurement errors when the two methods provide discrepant estimates."

https://openalex.org/W2790383881,"This paper presents a novel two-stage image segmentation method using an edge scaled energy functional based on local and global information for intensity inhomogeneous image segmentation. In the first stage, we integrate global intensity term with a geodesic edge term, which produces a preliminary rough segmentation result. Thereafter, by taking final contour of the first stage as initial contour, we begin second stage segmentation process by integrating local intensity term with geodesic edge term to get final segmentation result. Due to the suitable initialization from the first stage, the second stage precisely achieves desirable segmentation result for inhomogeneous image segmentation. Two stage segmentation technique not only increases the accuracy but also eliminates the problem of initial contour existed in traditional local segmentation methods. The energy function of the proposed method uses both global and local terms incorporated with compacted geodesic edge term in an additive fashion which uses image gradient information to delineate obscured boundaries of objects inside an image. A Gaussian kernel is adapted for the regularization of the level set function and to avoid an expensive re-initialization. The experiments were carried out on synthetic and real images. Quantitative validations were performed on Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) 2015 and PH2 skin lesion database. The visual and quantitative comparisons will demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method."

These responses are highly important for neuron growth cone guidance, synapse formation, and regeneration following injury. Because an altered spatial distribution of mRNA can result in mental retardation or neurodegenerative diseases, subcellular transcriptome analysis of neurons could be a useful tool for studying these conditions, but current techniques, such as in situ hybridization, bulk microarray, and RNA-Seq, impose tradeoffs between spatial resolution and multiplexing. To obtain a comprehensive analysis of the cell body versus neurite transcriptome from the same neuron, we have recently developed a label-free, single-cell nanobiopsy platform based on scanning ion conductance microscopy that uses electrowetting within a quartz nanopipette to extract cellular material from living cells with minimal disruption of the cellular membrane and milieu. In this study, we used this platform to collect samples from the cell bodies and neurites of human neurons and analyzed the mRNA pool with multiplex RNA sequencing. The minute volume of a nanobiopsy sample allowed us to extract samples from several locations in the same cell and to map the various mRNA species to specific subcellular locations. In addition to previously identified transcripts, we discovered new sets of mRNAs localizing to neurites, including nuclear genes such as Eomes and Hmgb3.

https://openalex.org/W2786875689,"Epithelial cell polarity is controlled by components of the Scribble polarity module, and its regulation is critical for tissue architecture and cell proliferation and migration. In Drosophila melanogaster, the adaptor protein Guk-holder (Gukh) binds to the Scribbled (Scrib) and Discs Large (Dlg) components of the Scribble polarity module and plays an important role in the formation of neuromuscular junctions. However, Gukh’s role in epithelial tissue formation and the molecular basis for the Scrib–Gukh interaction remain to be defined. We now show using isothermal titration calorimetry that the Scrib PDZ1 domain is the major site for an interaction with Gukh. Furthermore, we defined the structural basis of this interaction by determining the crystal structure of the Scrib PDZ1–Gukh complex. The C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of Gukh is located in the canonical ligand-binding groove of Scrib PDZ1 and utilizes an unusually extensive network of hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions to enable binding to PDZ1 with high affinity. We next examined the role of Gukh along with those of Scrib and Dlg in Drosophila epithelial tissues and found that Gukh is expressed in larval-wing and eye-epithelial tissues and co-localizes with Scrib and Dlg at the apical cell cortex. Importantly, we show that Gukh functions with Scrib and Dlg in the development of Drosophila epithelial tissues, with depletion of Gukh enhancing the eye- and wing-tissue defects caused by Scrib or Dlg depletion.

Cell polarity is a key property of tissue development and manifests itself as the asymmetric organization of cellular components, such as proteins and lipids into distinct cellular domains. Correct establishment of cell polarity is important for tissue architecture, cell proliferation, cell migration, and cellular fate, and its dysregulation has been recognized as a cancer hallmark, with ∼70% of epithelial cancers displaying defects in polarity regulation (1Elsum I.

Additionally, another study showed that the binding of Gukh to the GUK domain of Dlg occurs in a mutually exclusive manner via the PDZ domain, only permitting Gukh interaction when the PDZ remains unbound (28Qian Y.

Furthermore, in yeast two-hybrid assays the Gukh C-terminal region is able to engage Scrib PDZ2 but not PDZ3-4 (13Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M.

Biol. 2002; 12 (11937021): 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation analysis from Drosophila larval muscles showed that Scrib can form a complex with Dlg and Gukh, and the interaction with Dlg is reduced in a Gukh mutant (13Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V. Recruitment of scribble to the synaptic scaffolding complex requires GUK-holder, a novel DLG binding protein.Curr.

These genetic data suggest that Gukh is important for the formation of a ternary complex between Scrib, Dlg, and Gukh. Consistent with this notion, all three proteins co-localize at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, and Dlg and Gukh are required for the correct localization of Scrib (13Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V. Recruitment of scribble to the synaptic scaffolding complex requires GUK-holder, a novel DLG binding protein.Curr.

This interaction is likely to be evolutionarily conserved, as a Zebrafish Gukh ortholog, Nhs1b, also physically interacts with Scrib and Dlg in cultured cells, and nhs1b and scrib genetically interact as shown by the observation that heterozygotes show a strong neural cell migration defect relative to single heterozygotes (31Walsh G.S.

Although Drosophila Gukh interacts with Dlg and Scrib in neuromuscular junctions (13Mathew D. Gramates L.S. Packard M. Thomas U. Bilder D. Perrimon N. Gorczyca M. Budnik V.

Here, we identify the Scrib PDZ1 domain as the major interacting PDZ domain with the Gukh C-terminal peptide. Using X-ray crystallography, we then define the structural basis of Scrib PDZ1 interactions with the Gukh C-terminal peptide. Furthermore, our studies reveal a novel role for Gukh in epithelial development. We show that Gukh is expressed in larval-wing and eye-epithelial tissue and co-localizes with Scrib and Dlg at the apical cell cortex. Importantly, we show that Gukh functions with Scrib and Dlg in Drosophila epithelial tissues, with depletion of Gukh enhancing the eye- and wing-tissue defects caused by Scrib or Dlg depletion. These findings provide the first evidence for a role for Gukh in the Scribble module in the control of epithelial cell polarity and provide structural and mechanistic insights into the Scrib–Gukh interaction in Drosophila. To understand the molecular basis of the reported interaction between Scrib and Gukh, we performed protein–ligand interaction studies using individual recombinant PDZ domains from Scrib and C-terminal peptides derived from Gukh, and we determined binding affinities using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). ITC experiments were conducted using purified Drosophila Scrib PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, and PDZ4 domains with wildtype Gukh C-terminal peptides. Raw heats of titrations obtained for PDZ1 with GukhWT peptide revealed a tight interaction with a calculated KD of 664 nm, whereas PDZ3 engaged GukhWT peptide with only modest affinity with a KD of 27.8 μm. In contrast, PDZ2 and PDZ4 did not show any detectable binding to GukhWT peptide, thus rendering the Scrib PDZ1 domain as the primary functional interaction site for the Gukh C terminus.Table 1Summary of thermodynamic binding parameters for Scrib PDZ domain interactions with Gukh peptide measured at pH 7.5 and 25 °CKD−ΔHTΔSNnmkcal/molcal/mol/KPDZ1664 ± 12912.5 ± 0.8−13.8 ± 2.50.91 ± 0.18PDZ2NBaNB denotes no binding.NBNBNBPDZ327800 ± 74002.8.3 ± 1.0−12.7 ± 3.40.88 ± 0.05PDZ4NBNBNBNBa NB denotes no binding.

Drosophila Scrib PDZ1 adopts the typical PDZ fold consisting of six β-strands and two α-helices that form a β-sandwich structure (Fig. 2A) and is highly similar to the previously determined human PDZ1 (hsPDZ1) structure (PDB code 2W4F). The PDZ1 domain from the PDZ1–Gukh complex superimposes with the apo hsPDZ1 domain with an r.m.s.d. of 0.8995 Å over 92 Cα atoms, indicating that the binding of the Gukh peptide to the PDZ1 domain does not substantially change the overall fold (Fig. 2B).Table 2Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsPDZ1/Gukh peptideData collection Space groupC2221 No. of molecules in asymmetric unit1 + 1 Cell dimensions a, b, c (Å)36.43, 53.88, 94.22 α, β, γ (°)90.00, 90.00, 90.00 Wavelength (Å)0.9537 Resolution (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.31.42–1.55 (1.58–1.55) Rsym or RmergeaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.0.094 (0.580) I/σIaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.18.4 (4.3) CC(1/2)0.99 (0.92) Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.98.2 (94.6) RedundancyaValues in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell.13.8 (13.4) Wilson B-factor11.8 No. of unique reflections13,578 (617) No. of observed reflections187,879 (8282)Refinement Resolution (Å)31.42–1.55 Rwork/Rfree0.197/0.224 No. non-hydrogen atoms Protein766 Ligand/ion38 Water135 B-factors Protein13.42 Ligand/ion18.45 Water23.39 r.m.s.d.

Open table in a new tab In the PDZ1–Gukh structure, PDZ1 features an atypical β5 displaying increased flexibility in its geometry. PDZ1 interacts with Gukh peptide via its canonical ligand-binding groove formed by the β2 strand and helix α2 (Fig. 2, A and C). Gukh binding to PDZ1 buries a combined total of 937 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, with the interface having a shape complementarity score of 0.78, indicating a very good fit. In the complex, the Gukh peptide faces the β2 strand in an anti-parallel manner, with its N-terminal solvent exposed and its C terminus stabilized by the PDZ1 β1–2 loop. The complex is achieved via an extensive network of hydrogen bonds formed by Leu-741PDZ1–Leu-1788Gukh, Leu-743PDZ1–Leu-1788Gukh, Ile-745PDZ1–Thr-1786Gukh, Thr-752PDZ1–Pro-1782Gukh, Ser-764PDZ1–Glu-1785Gukh, His-796PDZ1–Thr-1786Gukh, as well as an ionic interaction between Arg-765PDZ1–Glu-1785Gukh. Furthermore, Gukh Leu-1788 is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket comprising Leu-741, Leu-743, Val-800, and Leu-803. Hydrophobic interactions are also present between Gukh Phe-1784 and dmPDZ1 Gly-747 and Ser-751, with Phe-1784Gukh being further stabilized by π-stacking with His-796PDZ1. To validate the crystal structure, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to target two key interactions, Arg-765PDZ1–Glu-1785Gukh and His-796PDZ1–Phe-1784Gukh, as well as the floor of the canonical PBM-binding site via G747W (Table 3). Mutation of Arg-765 to an Ala resulted in a 5-fold reduction in affinity (KD = 5.1 μm), whereas the H796A displayed no affinity for WT Gukh, suggesting that both residues make important contributions for Scrib PDZ1–Gukh interactions. Furthermore, introduction of the large hydrophobic Trp at Gly-747PDZ1 also completely ablates the ability of PDZ1 to bind to the PBM of Gukh (Table 3).Table 3Summary of binding parameters for wildtype and mutants of Scrib PDZ1 domain interactions with Gukh peptide measured at pH 7.5 and 25 °CScribbleKDNnmWT PDZ1664 ± 1290.91 ± 0.18PDZ1 R765A5100 ± 22200.89 ± 0.04PDZ1 H796ANBaNB denotes no binding.NBPDZ1 G747WNBNBa NB denotes no binding.

https://openalex.org/W2792613799,"Cancer cell migration requires that cells respond and adapt to their surroundings. In the absence of extracellular matrix cues, cancer cells will undergo a mesenchymal to ameboid transition, whereas a highly confining space will trigger a switch to ""leader bleb-based"" migration. To identify oncogenic signaling pathways mediating these transitions, we undertook a targeted screen using clinically useful inhibitors. Elevated Src activity was found to change actin and focal adhesion dynamics, whereas inhibiting Src triggered focal adhesion disassembly and blebbing. On non-adherent substrates and in collagen matrices, amoeboid-like, blebbing cells having high Src activity formed protrusions of the plasma membrane. To evaluate the role of Src in confined cells, we use a novel approach that places cells under a slab of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which is held at a defined height. Using this method, we find that leader bleb-based migration is resistant to Src inhibition. High Src activity was found to markedly change the architecture of cortical actomyosin, reduce cell mechanical properties, and the percentage of cells that undergo leader bleb-based migration. Thus, Src is a signal transducer that can potently influence transitions between migration modes with implications for the rational development of metastasis inhibitors."

During the study period, 744 HRSV-positive cases were identified by rapid diagnostic test. Of these, 572 samples were positive by real-time PCR; 400 (69.9%) were HRSV-A, and 172 (30.1%) were HRSV-B. HRSV-A and -B alternated as the dominant strain in the subsequent seasons. Phylogenetic tree analysis of the second hyper-variable region of the G protein classified the HRSV-A specimens into NA1 (n = 242) and ON1 (n = 114) genotypes and the HRSV-B specimens into BA9 (n = 60), and BA10 (n = 27). The ON1 genotype, containing a 72-nucleotide duplication in the G protein’s second hyper-variable region, was first detected in the 2012–2013 season but it predominated and replaced the older NA1 HRSV-A in the 2014–2015 season, which also coincided with a record number of HRSV cases reported to the National Infectious Disease Surveillance in Japan. The risk of hospitalization was 6.9 times higher for the ON1 genotype compared to NA1. In conclusion, our data showed that the emergence and predominance of the relatively new ON1 genotype in Japan was associated with a record high number of cases and increased risk for hospitalization."

Although reports on CRISPR/Cas9 technology such as genome editing and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) in eukaryotes increased, those in prokaryotes especially in Staphylococci were limited. Thus, its potential in the bacteriology remains unexplored. This is attributed to ecological difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Here, we constructed a novel CRISPRi plasmid vector, pBACi for Staphylococcus aureus. The transformation efficiency of S. aureus was ~104 CFU/μg DNA using a vector extracted from dcm negative, which encoded one of DNA modification genes, E. coli. Further, pBACi was introduced into various clinical isolates including that not accepting the conventional temperature-sensitive vector. dcas9 in the vector was expressed throughout the growth phases of S. aureus and this vector decreased various gene mRNA expressions based on the crRNA targeting sequences and altered the knockdown strains’ phenotypes. The targeted genes included various virulence and antibiotic resistant genes. Bioinformatics suggest this vector can be introduced into wide range of low-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Because this new CRISPR/Cas9-based vector can easily prepare knockdown strains, we believe the novel vector will facilitate the characterization of the function of genes from S. aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria."

The aim of this study was to identify and map areas that are ecologically suitable for the harboring of B. anthracis spores within the KNP. Anthrax surveillance data and selected environmental variables were used as inputs to the maximum entropy (Maxent) species distribution modeling method. Anthrax positive carcasses from 1988-2011 in KNP (n = 597) and a total of 40 environmental variables were used to predict and evaluate their relative contribution to suitability for anthrax occurrence in KNP. The environmental variables that contributed the most to the occurrence of anthrax were soil type, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation. Apart from the endemic Pafuri region, several other areas within KNP were classified as ecologically suitable. The outputs of this study could guide future surveillance efforts to focus on predicted suitable areas for anthrax, since the KNP currently uses passive surveillance to detect anthrax outbreaks."

While aerial seeding is common in areas with serious soil erosion, few studies have been conducted to investigate changes in soil C and N cycling as affected by understory vegetation in aerially seeded plantations. Here, we studied soil C and N characteristics under two naturally formed understory vegetation types (Dicranopteris and graminoid) in aerially seeded Pinus massoniana Lamb plantations. Across the two studied understory vegetation types, soil organic C was significantly correlated with all measured soil N variables, including total N, available N, microbial biomass N and water-soluble organic N, while microbial biomass C was correlated with all measured variables except soil organic C. Dicranopteris and graminoid differed in their effects on soil C and N process. Except water-soluble organic C, all the other C and N variables were higher in soils with graminoids. The higher levels of soil organic C, microbial biomass C, total N, available N, microbial biomass N and water-soluble organic N were consistent with the higher litter and root quality (C/N) of graminoid vegetation compared to Dicranopteris. Changes in soil C and N cycles might be impacted by understory vegetation types via differences in litter or root quality."

In the current study, biomimetic liver constructs were made via perfusion decellularization of rat liver, with the goal of maintaining the native composition and structure of the extracellular matrix. We optimized our decellularization process to produce liver scaffolds in which immunogenic residual DNA was removed but glycosaminoglycans were maintained. When the constructs were recellularized with rat or human liver cells, the cells remained viable, capable of proliferation, and functional for 28 days. Specifically, the cells continued to express cytochrome P450 genes and maintained their ability to metabolize a model drug, midazolam. Microarray analysis showed an upregulation of genes involved in liver regeneration and fibrosis. In conclusion, these liver constructs have the potential to be used as test beds for studying liver biology and drug metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2789703571,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKAc) is a pivotal signaling protein in eukaryotic cells. PKAc has two well-characterized regulatory subunit proteins, RI and RII (each having α and β isoforms), which keep the PKAc catalytic subunit in a catalytically inactive state until activation by cAMP. Previous reports showed that the RIα regulatory subunit is phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in vitro, whereupon phosphorylated RIα no longer inhibits PKAc at normal (1:1) stoichiometric ratios. However, the significance of this phosphorylation as a mechanism for activating type I PKA holoenzymes has not been fully explored, especially in cellular systems. In this study, we further examined the potential of RIα phosphorylation to regulate physiologically relevant ""desensitization"" of PKAc activity. First, the serine 101 site of RIα was validated as a target of PKGIα phosphorylation both in vitro and in cells. Analysis of a phosphomimetic substitution in RIα (S101E) showed that modification of this site increases PKAc activity in vitro and in cells, even without cAMP stimulation. Numerous techniques were used to show that although Ser101 variants of RIα can bind PKAc, the modified linker region of the S101E mutant has a significantly reduced affinity for the PKAc active site. These findings suggest that RIα phosphorylation may be a novel mechanism to circumvent the requirement of cAMP stimulus to activate type I PKA in cells. We have thus proposed a model to explain how PKG phosphorylation of RIα creates a ""sensitized intermediate"" state that is in effect primed to trigger PKAc activity."

In the course of development of a universal vaccine, it is necessary to consider that immunity must be generated even against viruses from different hosts because new human epidemic virus strains have their origins in viruses of birds and other animals. We have enriched conserved viral proteins–nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 2 (M2)—by B and T-cell epitopes not only human origin but also swine and avian origin. For this purpose, we analyzed M2 and NP sequences with respect to changes in the sequences of known T and B-cell epitopes and chose conserved and evolutionarily significant epitopes. Eventually, we found consensus sequences of M2 and NP that have the maximum quantity of epitopes that are 100% coincident with them. Consensus epitope-enriched amino acid sequences of M2 and NP proteins were included in a recombinant adenoviral vector. Immunization with Ad5-tet-M2NP induced strong CD8 and CD4 T cells responses, specific to each of the encoded antigens, i.e. M2 and NP. Eight months after immunization with Ad5-tet-M2NP, high numbers of M2- and NP-responding “effector memory” CD44posCD62neg T cells were found in the mouse spleens, which revealed a long-term T cell immune memory conferred by the immunization. In all, the challenge experiments showed an extraordinarily wide-ranging efficacy of protection by the Ad5-tet-M2NP vaccine, covering 5 different heterosubtypes of influenza A virus (2 human, 2 avian and 1 swine)."

Initially, RJ (200mg/Kg) was administered for fourteen days and stressed groups were submitted to chronic stress from the seventh day. The results showed that RJ supplementation decreases corticosterone levels and improves glycemia control after stress induction. RJ supplementation also decreased the body weight, AST, ALP and GGT.

The development of biomarkers to rapidly identify underlying pathogens could improve treatment options and clinical outcomes in childhood diarrheal diseases. Here, we perform RNA sequencing on blood samples collected from children evaluated in an emergency room setting with diarrheal disease where the pathogen(s) present are known.

Specifically, we observed differential expression of genes related to chemokine receptors or inflammasome signaling in Shigella cases, such as CCR3, CXCR8, and NLRC4, and interferon response genes, such as IFI44 and OASL, in rotavirus cases. Our findings add insight into the host peripheral immune response to these pathogens, and suggest strategies and limitations for the use host response transcript signatures for diagnosing the etiologic agent of childhood diarrheal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2786698717,"The stemness maintenance of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) requires pluripotency transcription factors, including Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. We have previously reported that protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7), an epigenetic modifier, is an essential pluripotency factor that maintains the stemness of mouse ESCs, at least in part, by down-regulating the expression of the anti-stemness microRNA (miRNA) miR-24-2. To gain greater insight into the molecular basis underlying PRMT7-mediated maintenance of mouse ESC stemness, we searched for new PRMT7-down-regulated anti-stemness miRNAs. Here, we show that miR-221 gene–encoded miR-221-3p and miR-221-5p are anti-stemness miRNAs whose expression levels in mouse ESCs are directly repressed by PRMT7. Notably, both miR-221-3p and miR-221-5p targeted the 3′ untranslated regions of mRNA transcripts of the major pluripotency factors Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 to antagonize mouse ESC stemness. Moreover, miR-221-5p silenced also the expression of its own transcriptional repressor PRMT7. Transfection of miR-221-3p and miR-221-5p mimics induced spontaneous differentiation of mouse ESCs. CRISPR-mediated deletion of the miR-221 gene, as well as specific antisense inhibitors of miR-221-3p and miR-221-5p, inhibited the spontaneous differentiation of PRMT7-depleted mouse ESCs. Taken together, these findings reveal that the PRMT7-mediated repression of miR-221-3p and miR-221-5p expression plays a critical role in maintaining mouse ESC stemness.

https://openalex.org/W2787044354,"Social media has the potential to increase social participation and support for the well-being of individuals with chronic medical conditions. To date, Facebook is the most popular social medium for different types of communication. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the potential use of Facebook as a means of communication for persons with potential Mild Acquired Cognitive Impairment (MACI), a non-progressive mild cognitive impairment after an acquired brain injury. The aim of this study was to explore how persons with potential MACI, specifically persons with perceived brain fatigue after brain injury, communicate through Facebook, to classify the content of the communication and to visualize the frequency and types of interactions.A social network analysis of the interactions between members' and a qualitative content analysis of a whole year's communication of a public Facebook group for Swedish speaking persons (1310 members) with perceived brain fatigue after an illness or injury to the brain were performed.The results showed how members use social media technology and Facebook as a means for communication and support for their condition. Individual group members showed very different patterns of communication and interactions. However, for the group as a whole, the most frequent topics in their communication were related to informational support and banter in posts, and socialization in comments. The findings also showed that the majority of members only communicated with few other members and had few direct communications. The most used communication feature of Facebook was likes in form of ""thumbs-up"".This study indicated that social media and in this case Facebook is used for communication and social support by persons with potential MACI, and revealed that their communication behavior is similar to the healthy population. Further studies relating specific cognitive problems of the participants to the use of social media would provide more reliable results for this specific group."
https://openalex.org/W2790600367,"Perilymphatic fistula is defined as an abnormal communication between the perilymph-filled space and the middle ear, or cranial spaces. The manifestations include a broad spectrum of neuro-otological symptoms such as hearing loss, vertigo/dizziness, disequilibrium, aural fullness, tinnitus, and cognitive dysfunction. By sealing the fistula, perilymphatic fistula is a surgically correctable disease. Also, appropriate recognition and treatment of perilymphatic fistula can improve a patient's condition and hence the quality of life. However, the difficulty in making a definitive diagnosis due to the lack of an appropriate biomarker to detect perilymph leakage has caused a long-standing debate regarding its management. We have reported a clinical test for the diagnosis of perilymphatic fistula by detecting a perilymph specific protein, Cochlin-tomoprotein, as a diagnostic marker using a western blot. The aim of this study is to establish an ELISA-based human Cochlin-tomoprotein detection test and to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in clinical subjects. The results of ELISA showed good dilution reproducibility. The mean concentration was 49.7±9.4 of 10 perilymph samples. The ROC curve in differentiating the perilymph leakage condition from the normal middle ear was significant (P < 0.001) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918 (95% CI 0.824-0.100). We defined the diagnostic criteria as follows: CTP<0.4 negative; 0.4≦CTP<0.8 intermediate; 0.8≦CTP(ng/ml) positive in the clinical usage of the hCTP ELISA, and sensitivity and specificity were 86.4% and 100%, respectively. We further tested the expression specificity of the Cochlin-tomoprotein by testing blood and CSF samples. The concentration was below the detection limit (0.2 ng/ml) in 38 of the 40 blood, and 14 of the 19 CSF samples. We report the accuracy of this test for the diagnosis of perilymphatic fistula. Using ELISA, we can improve the throughput of the test. Furthermore, it is useful for a large-scale study to characterize the clinical picture and delineate the management of this medical condition."
https://openalex.org/W2785747592,"Background The prevalence and prognostic implications of hypoxemia either at rest or during six-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients with idiopathic or heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH or HPAH) have not been systemically studied. Objectives We sought to determine the prevalence, phenotypic and prognostic implications of hypoxemia in patients with IPAH and HPAH. Methods Patients with IPAH or HPAH were identified from the Cleveland Clinic Pulmonary Hypertension Registry. Pulse oximetry (SpO2) at rest and during 6MWT was used to define hypoxemia at rest or during activities when measurements were lower than 90%, respectively. Results A total of 292 patients (age 50.6 ± 18.0 years, 73% females) with IPAH (88%) and HPAH (12%) were included. Of them, 143 (49%) had SpO2 >90% at rest and during 6MWT, 89 (31%) subjects had hypoxemia during 6MWT and 60 (20%) had hypoxemia at rest. Patients with hypoxemia had older age, greater body mass index, higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, worse functional capacity and pulmonary function tests but less severe pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension. Individuals with hypoxemia either at rest or during the initial 6MWT had worse long-term survival when compared to subjects without hypoxemia, even when adjusting for a great number of potential confounders. (HR: 2.5 (95% CI: 1.54–3.98)) Conclusions Hypoxemia in patients with IPAH and HPAH is associated with more comorbidities, less severe pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension and worse survival."
https://openalex.org/W2785751959,"Elasmobranchs are among the most threatened long-lived marine species worldwide, and incidental capture is a major source of mortality. The northern central Adriatic Sea, though one of the most overfished basins of the Mediterranean Sea, supports a very valuable marine biodiversity, including elasmobranchs. This study assesses the impact of the northern central Adriatic pelagic trawl fishery on common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), common eagle ray (Myliobatis aquila), and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) by examining incidental catches recorded between 2006 and 2015. The distribution of bycatch events was evaluated using geo-referenced data. Generalized Linear Models were computed to standardize the catch of the four species and to predict the relative abundance of bycatch events. Data analysis shows that most bycatch events involving all four species occurred in the northern Adriatic Sea. The models predicted significant, distinct temporal patterns of standardized catches in line with previous investigations. Water depth, season, and fishing region were the best predictors to explain bycatch events. The present data suggest that the northern Adriatic may be an important nursery area for several elasmobranchs. They also highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the interactions between elasmobranchs and fisheries to develop and apply suitable, ad hoc management measures."
https://openalex.org/W2786234810,"Motion blur in images is usually modeled as the convolution of a point spread function (PSF) and the original image represented as pixel intensities. The knife-edge function can be used to model various types of motion-blurs, and hence it allows for the construction of a PSF and accurate estimation of the degradation function without knowledge of the specific degradation model. This paper addresses the problem of image restoration using a knife-edge function and optimal window Wiener filtering. In the proposed method, we first calculate the motion-blur parameters and construct the optimal window. Then, we use the detected knife-edge function to obtain the system degradation function. Finally, we perform Wiener filtering to obtain the restored image. Experiments show that the restored image has improved resolution and contrast parameters with clear details and no discernible ringing effects."

Considering the scientific value of IMP studies, it is surprising that there are no methods that can provide solutions for improved expression outcomes with broad applicability across protein families and genomes.

The reasons for this failure to connect sequence to expression probably lie in the complex underpinnings of IMP biogenesis, where the interplay between many sequence features at both the protein and nucleotide levels must be considered. Optimizing for a single sequence feature probably diminishes the beneficial effect of other features (e.g. increasing TM hydrophobicity might diminish favorable mRNA properties). Without accounting for the broad set of sequence features related to IMP expression, it is impossible to predict differences in expression levels. Development of a low-cost, computational resource that significantly and reliably predicts improved expression outcomes would transform the study of IMPs.

Such predictors are primarily based on available experimental results from the Protein Structure Initiative (26Chen L. Oughtred R. Berman H.M. Westbrook J.

Whereas collectively, these methods have supported significant advances in biochemistry, none of the models are able to predict IMP outcomes due to limitations inherent in the model development process. As IMPs have an extremely low success rate, they are either explicitly excluded from the training process or are implicitly down-weighted by the statistical model (for representative methodology, see Ref. 28Slabinski L. Jaroszewski L. Rodrigues A.P.C. Rychlewski L. Wilson I.A. Lesley S.A. Godzik A. The challenge of protein structure determination: lessons from structural genomics.Protein Sci. 2007; 16 (17962404): 2472-248210.1110/ps.073037907Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consequently, none have successfully been able to map IMP expression to sequence. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to predict IMP expression directly from sequence. The resulting predictor allows one to enrich expression trials for proteins with a higher probability of success. To connect sequence to prediction, we develop a statistical model that maps a set of sequences to experimental expression levels via calculated features, thereby simultaneously accounting for the many potential determinants of expression. The resulting IMProve model allows ranking of any arbitrary set of IMP sequences in order of their relative likelihood of successful expression. The IMProve model is extensively validated against a variety of independent data sets, demonstrating that it can be used broadly to predict the likelihood of expression in Escherichia coli of any IMP. With IMProve, we have built a way for more than 2-fold enrichment of positive expression outcomes relative to the rate attained from the current method of randomly selecting targets. We highlight how the model informs on the biological underpinnings that drive likely expression. Finally, we provide direct examples where the model can be used for a typical researcher. Our novel approach and the resulting IMProve model provide an exciting paradigm for connecting sequence space to complex experimental outcomes. For this study, we focus on heterologous expression in E. coli, due to its ubiquitous use as a host across the spectrum of the membrane proteome. Low cost and low barriers for adoption highlight the utility of E. coli as a broad tool if the expression problem can be overcome. Furthermore, proof-of-principle in E. coli will illustrate methodology for constructing similar predictive methods for expressing IMPs in other hosts (e.g. yeast, insect cells). A key component of any data-driven statistical model is the choice of data set used for training. Having searched the literature, we identified two publications that contained quantitative data sets on overexpression of E. coli polytopic IMPs in E. coli. The first set, from Daley and Rapp et al. (20Daley D.O. Rapp M. Granseth E. Melén K. Drew D. von Heijne G.

The second set, from Fluman et al. (29Fluman N. Navon S. Bibi E.

The expression levels strongly correlated (Spearman’s ρ = 0.73) between the two data sets, demonstrating that normalized GFP activity was a good measure of the amount of folded IMP (Fig. 1A) (29Fluman N. Navon S. Bibi E.

Table S1 includes a detailed description of each feature. All features are calculated solely from the coding region of each gene of interest excluding other portions of the open reading frame and plasmid (e.g. linkers and tags, 5′-untranslated region, copy number). Fitting the data to a simple linear regression provides a facile method for deriving a weight for each feature. However, using the set of sequence features, we were unable to successfully fit a linear regression using the normalized GFP and PhoA measurements reported in the Daley and Rapp et al. (20Daley D.O. Rapp M. Granseth E. Melén K. Drew D. von Heijne G. Global topology analysis of the Escherichia coli inner membrane proteome.Science. 2005; 308 (15919996): 1321-132310.1126/science.1109730Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) study. Similarly, using the same feature set and data, we were unable to train a standard linear support vector machine (SVM) to predict the expression data either averaged or across all plates (see Table S1 and “Materials and methods” 2 and 3). Due to the attempts by others to fit these data, this outcome may not be surprising and suggested that a more complex analysis was required. We hypothesized that training on relative measurements across the entire data set introduced errors that were limiting. To address this, we instead only compare measurements within an individual plate, where differences between trials are less likely to introduce errors. To account for this, a preference-ranking linear SVM algorithm (SVMrank (43Tsochantaridis I. Joachims T. Hofmann T. Altun Y. Large margin methods for structured and interdependent output variables.J. Mach. Learn. Res. 2005; 6: 1453-1484Google Scholar)) was chosen (see “Materials and methods” 4b). Simply put, the SVMrank algorithm determines the optimal weight for each sequence feature to best rank the order of expression outcomes within each plate over all plates, which results in a model where higher-expressing proteins have higher scores. The outcome is identical in structure to a multiple linear regression, but instead of minimizing the sum of squared residuals, the SVMrank cost function accounts for the platewise constraint specified above. In practice, the process optimizes the correlation coefficient Kendall’s τ (Equation 1) to converge upon a set of weights. τKendall=No.ofcorrectlyorderedpairs−no.ofswappedpairsNo.oftotalpairs(1) The SVMrank training metric shows varying agreement for all three groups (i.e. τKendall > 0) (Fig. 1B). For individual genes, activity values normalized and averaged across trials were not directly used for the training procedure (see “Materials and methods” 4a), yet one would anticipate that scores for each gene should broadly correlate with the expression average. Indeed, the observed normalized activities positively correlate with the score (dubbed the IMProve score for integral membrane protein expression improvement) output by the model (Fig. 1C, ρ > 0). Because SVMrank transforms raw expression levels within each plate to ranks before training, Spearman’s ρ, a rank correlation coefficient describing the agreement between two ranked quantities, is better suited for quantifying correlation over more common metrics like the R2 of a regression and Pearson’s r.

We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the clinical impact of the timing of azithromycin treatment in children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in high macrolide-resistant prevalence settings. Methods and findings A total of 623 patients were enrolled in this study and were divided into 2 groups according to the timing of azithromycin therapy. Children who received azithromycin within 3 days (72 hours) after the onset of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia were classified into the early azithromycin treatment group (n = 174), whereas the late azithromycin treatment group (n = 449) comprised children treated with azithromycin more than 72 hours after symptom onset. We evaluated clinical prognosis according to demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics. Although the early azithromycin treatment group exhibited a longer fever duration after azithromycin administration (7.17±4.12 versus 4.82±3.99 days, P<0.01), the total fever duration exhibited no significant difference (9.02±4.58 versus 9.57±4.91 days, P = 0.212). After azithromycin therapy, the two groups exhibited no significant differences with respect to improvements in the laboratory and radiological findings (all P>0.05). Conclusion The timing of azithromycin treatment is not associated with the clinical prognosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia in children in high macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae prevalence settings."

Our objective is to assess the impacts of TLV on the cardiovascular system, particularly left ventricular diastolic function, in an ovine model of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Method Eight newborns lambs, 3.0 ± 0.4 days (3.2 ± 0.3kg) were used in this crossover experimental study. Animals were intubated, anesthetized and paralyzed. Catheters were inserted in the femoral and pulmonary arteries. A high-fidelity pressure catheter was inserted into the left ventricle. Surfactant deficiency was induced by repeated lung lavages with normal saline. TLV was then conducted for 2 hours using a liquid ventilator prototype. Thoracic echocardiography and cardiac output assessment by thermodilution were performed before and during TLV. Results Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (9.3 ± 2.1 vs. 9.2 ± 2.4mmHg, p = 0.89) and dimension (1.90 ± 0.09 vs. 1.86 ± 0.12cm, p = 0.72), negative dP/dt (-2589 ± 691 vs. -3115 ± 866mmHg/s, p = 0.50) and cardiac output (436 ± 28 vs. 481 ± 59ml/kg/min, p = 0.26) were not affected by TLV initiation. Left ventricular relaxation time constant (tau) slightly increased from 21.5 ± 3.3 to 24.9 ± 3.7ms (p = 0.03). Mean arterial systemic (48 ± 6 vs. 53 ± 7mmHg, p = 0.38) and pulmonary pressures (31.3 ± 2.5 vs. 30.4 ± 2.3mmHg, p = 0.61) were stable. As expected, the inspiratory phase of liquid cycling exhibited a small but significant effect on most variables (i.e. central venous pressure +2.6 ± 0.5mmHg, p = 0.001; LVEDP +1.18 ± 0.12mmHg, p<0.001). Conclusions TLV was well tolerated in our neonatal lamb model of severe respiratory distress syndrome and had limited impact on left ventricle diastolic function when compared to conventional mechanical ventilation."

Commercial food vendors in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa are commonly exposed to biomass smoke from open fire cooking both at work and home. Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of food vendors about the health hazards of biomass smoke exposure in Nigeria. Methods We did a descriptive cross sectional survey of the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of commercial food vendors in the cities of Benin and Calabar in Nigeria. We recruited respondents using a multi-stage approach. Structured interviewer-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. Results We recruited 308 participants (164, 53.2% female). The majority 185(60.2%) were married and had post-primary education 206(67.4%). The average monthly income was <30,000 Naira (US$150). Most 198(64.4%) were not aware that biomass smoke exposure is harmful to human health. About three-quarters (221; 71.8%) were unconcerned as to the effect of exposure to fumes from biomass fuels on their health. Less than half of respondents (110, 41.6%) believed biomass smoke was harmful to health. Male gender, being single, having post-primary education and preferring electricity or gas fuels were associated with good knowledge of the adverse health effects of biomass smoke exposure whilst female gender and having good knowledge of the adverse health effects of biomass smoke were associated with positive attitudes towards preventing exposure. Conclusion Commercial food vendors in our study had limited knowledge about the adverse health effects of biomass smoke exposure and negative attitudes towards preventing these adverse health effects. We suggest an educational intervention is needed to improve this knowledge."

Experiments performed on dilutions of purified RNA establish assay linearity over a dynamic range of at least 104, a qPCR precision of 15%, and detection sensitivity down to a single cDNA molecule. We demonstrate the application of our device for rapid profiling of microRNA expression in single cells. Measurements performed on a panel of twenty miRNAs in two types of cells revealed clear cell-to-cell heterogeneity, with evidence of spontaneous differentiation manifested as distinct expression signatures. Highly multiplexed microfluidic RT-qPCR fills a gap in current capabilities for single-cell analysis, providing a rapid and cost-effective approach for profiling panels of marker genes, thereby complementing single-cell genomics methods that are best suited for global analysis and discovery. We expect this approach to enable new studies requiring fast, cost-effective, and precise measurements across hundreds of single cells."

Therefore the aim of the study was to measure the concentration of selected markers of endothelial dysfunction: von Willebrand factor (vWf), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and soluble VE-cadherin (sVE-cadherin) in CVI women who constitute the most numerous group of patients suffering from venous disease. Materials and methods Forty four women with CVI were involved in the study and divided into subgroups based on CEAP classification. Concentration of vWf, sP-selectin, sTM and sVE-cadherin were measured and compared with those obtained in 25 healthy age and sex-matched women. Results It was found that the concentration of sTM increased and sVEcadherin decreased along with disease severity in CVI women. A significant rise of sTM was observed especially in CVI women, with the highest inflammation status reflected by hsCRP or elastase concentration, and in CVI women with a high oxidative stress manifested by an increased plasma MDA. A significant fall of circulating sVE-cadherin was reported in CVI women with moderate to highest intensity of inflammation and oxidative stress. There was no change in vWF and sP-selectin concentration at any stage of CVI severity. Conclusions The results of the present study demonstrate the presence of endothelial dysfunction in women suffering from CVI which seems to progress with the disease severity and may be associated with inflammation and enhanced oxidative stress."

We subjected a clonal wetland plant Phragmites australis to three frequencies of drying-rewetting cycles (1, 2, or 4 cycles), two nutrient treatments (with or without), and two AMF treatments (with or without) for 64 days. AMF promoted the growth of P. australis, especially in the 2 cycles of the drying-rewetting treatment. AMF had a significant positive effect on leaf mass and number of ramets in the 2 cycles of the drying-rewetting treatment with nutrient addition. In the 2 cycles of drying-rewetting treatment without nutrient addition, AMF increased leaf area and decreased belowground to aboveground biomass ratio. These results indicate that AMF may assist P. australis in coping with medium frequency of drying-rewetting cycles, and provide theoretical guidance for predicting how wetland plants respond to future global climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2786787944,"For nearly 400 million years, insects and plants have been embattled in an evolutionary arms race. Insects have developed diverse feeding strategies and behaviors in an effort to circumvent and overcome an extensive collection of plant defense tactics. Sap-sucking insects often inject saliva into hosts plants, which contains a suite of effector proteins and even microbial communities that can alter the plant's defenses. Lacking salivary glands, leaf-feeding beetles represent an interesting group of phytophagous insects. Feeding beetles regurgitate onto leaf surfaces and it is thought that these oral secretions influence insect-plant interactions and even play a role in virus-vector specificity. Since the molecular and biological makeup of the regurgitant is virtually unknown, we carried out RNA sequencing and 16S rDNA analysis on a major soybean pest, Epilachna varivestis, to generate the first ever beetle ""regurgitome"" and characterize its microbiome. Interestingly, the regurgitant is comprised of a rich molecular assortment of genes encoding putative extracellular proteins involved in digestion, molting, immune defense, and detoxification. By carrying out plant inoculation assays, we reinforced the fundamental role of the regurgitant in beetle-borne virus specificity. Ultimately, these studies begin to characterize the importance of regurgitant in virus transmission and beetle-plant interactions."

We aimed to understand sex-related differences in the vascular responses to stent implantation by analyzing the pooled data of endovascular interventions in 164 Yucatan mini-swine (87 female, 77 male). Bare metal stents (BMS) or drug-eluting stents (DES) were implanted in 212 coronary arteries (63 single BMS implantation, 68 single DES implantation, 33 overlapped BMS implantation, and 48 overlapped DES implantation). Histomorphological parameters were evaluated from vascular specimens at 3–365 days after stent implantation and evaluated values were compared between female and male groups. While neointima formation at all times after implantation was invariant to sex, statistically significant differences between female and male groups were observed in injury, inflammation, adventitial fibrosis, and neointimal fibrin deposition. These differences were observed independently, i.e., for different procedure types and at different follow-up timings. Only subtle temporal sex-related differences were observed in extent and timing of resolution of inflammation and fibrin clearance. These subtle sex-related differences may be increasingly important as interventional devices meld novel materials that erode and innovations in drug delivery. Erodible materials may act differently if inflammation has a different temporal sequence with sex, and drug distribution after balloon or stent delivery might be different if the fibrin clearance speaks to different modes of pharmacokinetics in male and female swine."
https://openalex.org/W2789883960,"Objectives The contribution of adiposity to cardiovascular and diabetes risk justifies the inclusion of an adiposity measure, usually waist circumference, in the definition of metabolic syndrome. However, waist circumference thresholds differ across populations. Our aim was to assess which adiposity measure performs the best in identifying the metabolic syndrome in a sample of Portuguese participants and to estimate cut-off values for these measures. Methods Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study (PORMETS study) conducted in Portugal between 2007 and 2009. A representative sample of non-institutionalized adults, comprising 3,956 participants, aged 18 years and older, was evaluated. A structured questionnaire was administered, collecting information on personal medical history, socio-demographics and behavioral characteristics. Anthropometrics, blood pressure and venous blood samples were also obtained. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the Joint Interim Statement of the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology recommended criteria. Elevated cardiometabolic risk was considered when two or more of the four criteria of metabolic syndrome were present, excluding the waist circumference component. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to estimate cut-off points. Results This study found that waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference and body adiposity index performed better than other adiposity measures, such as body mass index. The estimated cut-off points for waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference and body adiposity index in women and men were 0.564 / 89 cm / 27.4 and 0.571 / 93.5 cm / 25.5, respectively. Conclusion As waist circumference is currently used as the adiposity measure in the definition of metabolic syndrome and as no relevant differences were observed between this measure and waist-to-height ratio, it is likely that no modification to the metabolic syndrome definition needs to be proposed. Moreover, this study also confirmed the applicability of European cut-off points in the Portuguese population."

Debridément and lavages were progressed on day 7, 14, 28 and 56 to determine the local bacterial growth and the immune reaction. Hyperbaric oxygen (2 ATA, 90%) was applied for 90 minutes on day 7 to 21 for those mice allocated to HBO therapy. To evaluate the effect of HBO therapy the following groups were analyzed: Two sham-groups (12 mice / group) with and without HBO therapy, two osteotomy groups (24 mice / group) with plate osteosynthesis of the femur with and without HBO therapy, and two osteotomy SA infection groups (24 mice / group) with and without HBO therapy. Fracture healing was also quantified on day 7, 14, 28 and 56 by a.p. x-ray and bone healing markers from blood samples. Progression of infection was assessed by estimation of colony-forming units (CFU) and immune response was analyzed by determination of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), Interleukin (IL) - 6, and the circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in lavage samples. Osteitis induced significantly higher IL-6, cfDNA- and PMN-levels in the lavage samples (on day 7 and 14, each p < 0.05). HBO-therapy did not have a significant influence on the CFU and immune response compared to the standard therapy (each p > 0.05). At the same time HBO-therapy was associated with a delayed bone healing assessed by x-ray radiography and a higher rate of non-union until day 28. In conclusion, osteitis led to significantly higher bacterial count and infection parameters. HBO-therapy neither had a beneficial influence on local infection nor on immune response or fracture healing compared to the standard therapy in an osteitis mouse model."

Persistent discrimination of ethnical minorities can hinder successful integration. Given that unequal access to investment and financing opportunities can cause social and economic disparities due to inferior economic prospects, we conducted a field experiment on ethnical discrimination in the finance sector with 1,218 banks in seven European countries. We contacted banks via e-mail, either with domestic or Arabic sounding names, asking for contact details only. We find pronounced discrimination in terms of a substantially lower response rate to e-mails from Arabic senders. Remarkably, the observed discrimination effect is robust for loan- and investment-related requests, across rural and urban locations of banks, and across countries."
https://openalex.org/W2786942555,"The crucial role of water in the engine of life have encouraged many researchers in studying, both theoretically and experimentally, the possible “structure” of water. Many properties of water have been related to the interplay between two distinct and interconverting structural species, namely the low-density water (LDW) and the high-density water (HDW). Supported by the results obtained with other aqueous solutions, this paper deals with the possibility of using the ultra-weak delayed luminescence (DL) to investigate water structuring in a mixture with glycerol, characterized only by hydrogen bonds between the various molecules. Spectral and temporal characteristics of DL decays give information on the two components of the mixture, by evidencing the contribution of water at glycerol concentrations close to the values used in cryopreservation. DL results have shown a correlation with LDW clusters size as determined by other researchers on the basis of neutron diffraction experiments and computational modelling, as reported in Literature."
https://openalex.org/W2791400358,"Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is one of the main methods of reducing NOX emissions and has been widely used in marine diesel engines. This paper proposes an optimized comprehensive assessment method based on multi-objective grey situation decision theory, grey relation theory and grey entropy analysis to evaluate the performance and optimize rate determination of EGR, which currently lack clear theoretical guidance. First, multi-objective grey situation decision theory is used to establish the initial decision-making model according to the main EGR parameters. The optimal compromise between diesel engine combustion and emission performance is transformed into a decision-making target weight problem. After establishing the initial model and considering the characteristics of EGR under different conditions, an optimized target weight algorithm based on grey relation theory and grey entropy analysis is applied to generate the comprehensive evaluation and decision-making model. Finally, the proposed method is successfully applied to a TBD234V12 turbocharged diesel engine, and the results clearly illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method for providing theoretical support and a reference for further EGR optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2787945053,"The two most common surgical approaches to total hip arthroplasty are the posterior approach and lateral approach. The surgical approach may influence cup positioning and restoration of the offset, which may affect the biomechanical properties of the hip joint. The primary aim was to compare cup position between posterior approach and lateral approach. Secondary aims were to compare femoral offset, abductor moment arm and leg length discrepancy between the two approaches. Eighty patients with primary hip osteoarthritis were included in a randomized controlled trial and assigned to total hip arthroplasty using posterior approach or lateral approach. Postoperative radiographs from 38 patients in each group were included in this study for measurement of cup anteversion and inclination. Femoral offset, cup offset, total offset, abductor moment arm and leg length discrepancy were measured on preoperative and postoperative radiographs in 28 patients in each group. We found that mean anteversion was 5° larger in the posterior approach group (95% CI, -8.1 to -1.4; p = 0.006), while mean inclination was 5° less steep (95% CI, 2.7 to 7.2; p<0.001) compared with the lateral approach group. The posterior approach group had a larger mean femoral offset of 4.3mm (95% CI, -7.4 to -1.3, p = 0.006), mean total offset of 6.3mm (95% CI, -9.6 to -3; p<0.001) and mean abductor moment arm of 4.8mm (95% CI, -7.6 to -1.9; p = 0.001) compared with the lateral approach group. We found a larger cup anteversion but less steep cup inclination in the posterior approach group compared with the lateral approach group. Femoral offset and abductor moment arm were restored after total hip arthroplasty using lateral approach but significantly increased when using posterior approach."
https://openalex.org/W2787830184,"The green eggshell color produced by ducks is a threshold trait that can be influenced by various factors, such as hereditary, environment and nutrition. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic regulation of the formation of eggs with green shells in Youxian ducks. We performed integrative analysis of mRNAs and miRNAs expression profiling in the shell gland samples from ducks by RNA-Seq. We found 124 differentially expressed genes that were associated with various pathways, such as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter and solute carrier supper family pathways. A total of 31 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between ducks laying green eggs and white eggs. KEGG pathway analysis of the predicted miRNA target genes also indicated the functional characteristics of these miRNAs; they were involved in the ABC transporter pathway and the solute carrier (SLC) supper family. Analysis with qRT-PCR was applied to validate the results of global gene expression, which showed a correlation between results obtained by RNA-seq and RT-qPCR. Moreover, a miRNA-mRNA interaction network was established using correlation analysis of differentially expressed mRNA and miRNA. Compared to ducks that lay white eggs, ducks that lay green eggs include six up-regulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 35 down-regulated genes, and seven down-regulated miRNAs which influenced 46 up-regulated genes. For example, the ABC transporter pathway could be regulated by expressing gga-miR-144-3p (up-regulated) with ABCG2 (up-regulated) and other miRNAs and genes. This study provides valuable information about mRNA and miRNA regulation in duck shell gland tissues, and provides foundational information for further study on the eggshell color formation and marker-assisted selection for Youxian duck breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2792164345,"Many individuals at risk of streptococcal infection respond poorly to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine Pneumovax 23. Identification of actionable pathways able to enhance Pneumovax responsiveness is highly relevant. We investigated the contribution of the extracellular adenosine pathway regulated by the ecto-nucleotidase CD73 in Pneumovax-induced antibody responses. Using gene-targeted mice, we demonstrated that CD73-or A2a adenosine receptor deficiency significantly delayed isotype switching. Nevertheless, CD73- or A2aR- deficient adult mice ultimately produced antigen-specific IgG3 and controlled Streptococcus pneumoniae infection as efficiently as wild type (WT) mice. Compared to adults, young WT mice failed to control S. pneumoniae infection after vaccination and this was associated with lower levels of CD73 on innate B cells. We hypothesized that pharmacological activation of A2a receptor may improve Pneumovax 23 immunization in young WT mice. Remarkably, administration of the A2a adenosine receptor agonist CGS 21680 significantly increased IgG3 responses and significantly enhanced survival after S. pneumoniae challenge. Our study thus suggests that pharmacological activation of the A2a adenosine receptor could improve the efficacy of Pneumovax 23 vaccination in individuals at risk of streptococcal infection."
https://openalex.org/W2789667422,"The association of weight loss with health care costs among older women is uncertain. Our study aim was to examine the association of objectively measured weight change with subsequent total health care (THC) costs and other health care utilization among older women. Our study population included 2,083 women (mean age 80.2 years) enrolled in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures and U.S. Medicare Fee for Service. Weight loss and gain were defined, respectively, as ≥5% decrease and ≥5% increase in body weight, and weight maintenance as <5% change in body weight over a period of 4.5 years. THC costs, outpatient costs, hospitalizations, and skilled nursing facility [SNF] utilization were estimated from Medicare claims for 1 year after the period during which weight change was measured. The associations of weight change with THC and outpatient costs were estimated using generalized linear models with gamma variance and log link functions, and with hospitalizations and SNF utilization using logistic models. Adjusted for age and current body mass index (BMI), weight loss compared with weight maintenance was associated with a 35% increase in THC costs ($2148 [95% CI, 745 to 3552], 2014 U.S. dollars), a 15% increase in outpatient costs ($329 [95% C.I. −1 to 660]), and odds ratios of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.14 to 1.76) for ≥1 hospital stay and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.03 to 2.03) for ≥1 SNF stay. These associations did not vary by BMI category. After additional adjustment for multi-morbidity and functional status, associations of weight loss with all four outcomes were no longer significant. In conclusion, ≥5% weight loss among older women is not associated with increased THC and outpatient costs, hospitalization, and SNF utilization, irrespective of BMI category after accounting for multi-morbidity and impaired functional status that accompany weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W2792314751,"The present study evaluated the relative influence of body mass index (BMI) on insulin resistance (IR), first-phase insulin secretion (FPIS), second-phase insulin secretion (SPIS), and glucose effectiveness (GE) at a fixed fasting plasma glucose level in an older ethnic Chinese population.In total, 265 individuals aged 60 years with a fasting plasma glucose level of 5.56 mmol/L were enrolled. Participants had BMIs of 20.0-34.2 kg/m2. IR, FPIS, SPIS, and GE were estimated using our previously developed equations. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to assess the correlations between the four diabetogenesis factors and BMI. A general linear model was used to determine the differences in the percentage of change among the four factor slopes against BMI.Significant correlations were observed between BMI and FPIS, SPIS, IR, and GE in both women and men, which were higher than those reported previously. In men, BMI had the most profound effect on SPIS, followed by IR, FPIS, and GE, whereas in women, the order was slightly different: IR, followed by FPIS, SPIS, and GE. Significant differences were observed among all these slopes, except for the slopes between FPIS and SPIS in women (p = 0.856) and IR and FPIS in men (p = 0.258).The contribution of obesity to all diabetes factors, except GE, was higher than that reported previously. BMI had the most profound effect on insulin secretion in men and on IR in women in this 60-year-old cohort, suggesting that lifestyle modifications for obesity reduction in women remain the most important method for improving glucose metabolism and preventing future type 2 diabetes mellitus."
