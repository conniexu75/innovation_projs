https://openalex.org/W2060618478,"Chemotherapy and radiation therapy for cancer often have severe side effects that limit their efficacy. Because these effects are in part determined by p53-mediated apoptosis, temporary suppression of p53 has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to prevent damage of normal tissues during treatment of p53-deficient tumors. To test this possibility, a small molecule was isolated for its ability to reversibly block p53-dependent transcriptional activation and apoptosis. This compound, pifithrin-alpha, protected mice from the lethal genotoxic stress associated with anticancer treatment without promoting the formation of tumors. Thus, inhibitors of p53 may be useful drugs for reducing the side effects of cancer therapy and other types of stress associated with p53 induction."
https://openalex.org/W1990079924,"An evaporative cooling strategy that uses a two-component Fermi gas was employed to cool a magnetically trapped gas of 7 x 10(5) (40)K atoms to 0.5 of the Fermi temperature T(F). In this temperature regime, where the state occupation at the lowest energies has increased from essentially zero at high temperatures to nearly 60 percent, quantum degeneracy was observed as a barrier to evaporative cooling and as a modification of the thermodynamics. Measurements of the momentum distribution and the total energy of the confined Fermi gas directly revealed the quantum statistics."

The hypothesis that fungal endophyte symbiosis reduces diversity in successional fields was tested by manipulating infection of tall fescue, the most abundant perennial grass in the eastern United States. Over a 4-year period, species richness declined and tall fescue dominance increased in infected plots relative to uninfected plots without differences in total productivity. A host-specific endophyte, with negligible biomass, altered plant community structure in this long-term field experiment and may be reducing plant diversity throughout its expanding range."
https://openalex.org/W2038554369,"Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that is related both structurally and pharmacologically to indomethacin. In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, sulindac has been demonstrated to have a role in the prevention of colon cancer. Both its growth inhibitory and anti-inflammatory properties are due at least in part to its ability to decrease prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenases. Recently, we demonstrated that both aspirin and sodium salicylate, but not indomethacin, inhibited the activity of an IκB kinase β (IKKβ) that is required to activate the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. In this study, we show that sulindac and its metabolites sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone can also inhibit the NF-κB pathway in both colon cancer and other cell lines. Similar to our previous results with aspirin, this inhibition is due to sulindac-mediated decreases in IKKβ kinase activity. Concentrations of sulindac that inhibit IKKβ activity also reduce the proliferation of colon cancer cells. These results suggest that the growth inhibitory and anti-inflammatory properties of sulindac may be regulated in part by inhibition of kinases that regulate the NF-κB pathway.

The NF-κB1 pathway regulates the cellular response to a variety of stimuli including cytokines, bacterial and viral infection, and activation of cellular stress pathways (reviewed in Refs. 1Baeuerle P.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). For example, disruption of the gene encoding the p65 member of the NF-κB family leads to severe hepatic apoptosis indicating that at least in some cell types that NF-κB is a critical anti-apoptotic factor (5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Inhibition of apoptosis is likely mediated by NF-κB induction of cellular genes such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1 and -2 which inhibit the apoptotic process (4Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar, 6Chu Z.-L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J. Malim M.H. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl.

The fact that high constitutive levels of NF-κB are found in the nucleus of some tumors further implicates activation of this pathway as a potential mechanism to stimulate cellular growth (8Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 9Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Martin D.A. Goulet Jr., R.J. Sledge Jr., G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3629-3639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is comprised of a family of related proteins that can either heterodimerize or homodimerize to facilitate their binding to a consensus DNA element to result in activation of gene expression (reviewed in Refs. 1Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar and 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). The DNA binding and dimerization properties of NF-κB are mediated by a conserved domain in these proteins known as the Rel homology domain. NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm of cells where it is bound by a family of inhibitory proteins known as IκB (2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 10Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin A.S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins that include IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε contain multiple ankyrin repeats that are critical for their inhibitory function. The ability of the IκB to mask the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB prevents the nuclear translocation of these proteins (11Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A variety of stimuli including treatment of cells with TNFα, interleukin-1, phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide, and the viral protein Tax results in activation of the NF-κB pathway (2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar). These stimuli modulate signal transduction pathways that lead to the ability of upstream kinases including NIK and MEKK1 to activate the IκB kinases IKKα and IKKβ kinases (12Didonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

Stimulation of the activity of these kinases results in their ability to phosphorylate two conserved serine residues in the amino terminus of the IκB proteins (17Alkalay I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

This resultant phosphorylation of IκB leads to its ubiquitination and its degradation by the proteasome resulting in the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (19Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Aspirin and sodium salicylate, but not several other anti-inflammatory agents including indomethacin, can inhibit activation of the NF-κB pathway (24Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P. Science. 1996; 274: 1383-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 25Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar, 26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by aspirin and salicylate is the result of their specific binding to IKKβ which inhibits its kinase activity (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The effects of aspirin and salicylate prevent IκB degradation and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as an anti-inflammatory agent, aspirin can also help to prevent the development of colon cancer (27Thun M.J. Namboodiri M.M. Heath Jr., C.W. N. Engl. J.

Cancer Inst. 1991; 83: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent that is structurally related to indomethacin and inhibits cyclooxygenase activity to prevent prostaglandin synthesis (32Duggan D.E. Hooke K.F. Risley E.A. Shen T.Y. Van Arman C.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1977; 201: 8-13PubMed Google Scholar, 33Duggan D.E. Hooke K.F. Hwang S.S. Drug Metab.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the colon, sulindac is converted by bacteria to the metabolites sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone. Sulindac sulfide is the most active metabolite of sulindac and is concentrated in the colonic epithelium at concentrations that are at least 20-fold higher than those seen in the serum which are about 10–15 μm (33Duggan D.E. Hooke K.F. Hwang S.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1980; 8: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). Sulindac sulfide, but not sulindac sulfone, blocks prostaglandin synthesis by non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (33Duggan D.E. Hooke K.F. Hwang S.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1980; 8: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar). However, alternative mechanisms of sulindac action other than inhibition of prostaglandin function have been suggested. For example, sulindac sulfone can inhibit mammary carcinogenesis (36Thompson H.J. Jiang C. Lu J. Mehta R.G. Piazza G.A. Paranka N.S. Pamukcu R. Ahnen D.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 267-271PubMed Google Scholar), and sulindac sulfide inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines that do not express cyclooxygenases (37Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y. Koutsos M.I. Qiao L. Staiano-Coico L. Shiff S.I. Riggs B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Sulindac, like aspirin, has anti-inflammatory properties and has also been demonstrated to induce the regression of adenomatous colon polyps to help prevent the development of colon cancer (27Thun M.J.

Since sulindac and aspirin have similar pharmacologic properties, we investigated whether sulindac-like aspirin could also inhibit kinases that regulate the NF-κB pathway to mediate in part its anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic properties. In this study, we demonstrate that sulindac and its metabolites, sulindac sulfide and sulindac sulfone, inhibit the activation of the NF-κB pathway by inhibiting IKKβ kinase activity. This result suggests that inhibition of components of the NF-κB pathway may at least in part be involved in the anti-inflammatory properties and the growth properties inhibitory of these agents. COS, HCT-15, and HT-29 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air incubator at 37 °C. Aspirin, sodium salicylate, and sulindac were obtained from Sigma and dissolved in 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, to make 1 m stock solution. In transfection assays, aspirin and salicylate were used at a concentration of 5 mm sulindac; sulindac and sulindac sulfone were used at a concentration of 1 mm; sulindac sulfide was used at a concentration of 200 μm, and indomethacin and ibuprofen were used at a concentration of 25 μm. Indomethacin and ibuprofen were dissolved in ethanol to make a 100 mm stock solution (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). All the anti-inflammatory agents were added into cell culture medium for 16–18 h for the luciferase reporter gene expression assay or for 2 h prior to TNFα treatment and assays of IKK activity (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids hemagglutinin-tagged IKKα and FLAG-tagged IKKβ, and their constitutively active mutants (SS/EE), were described previously (49Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 long terminal repeat luciferase reporter contains the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat with two binding sites for NF-κB. Approximately 80% confluent COS, cells in 60-mm plates were transfected with the 3 μg of DNA using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 24–36 h after the transfection. Histidine and FLAG-tagged baculovirus-produced IKKα and IKKβ proteins were purified by nickel-agarose chromatography and immunoprecipitated with the M2 monoclonal antibody and then assayed in kinase assays as described (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Transfected COS cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 300 ng of M2 FLAG antibody or 50 μl of 12CA5 supernatant to precipitate the wild-type and mutant hemagglutinin-IKKα and wild-type and mutants FLAG-IKKβ using 200 μg of transfected cell lysate. This was followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A-agarose. After washing with the lysis buffer, the immunocomplex was then incubated with a kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-IκBα (aa 1–54) at 30 °C for 30 min. The kinase reaction mixture was resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). COS cells were treated with various concentrations of sulindac in vivo for 2 h before TNFα-treatment and assays of endogenous IKK activity. To assay endogenous IKK activity, cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against IKKα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) that immunoprecipitates the IKKα/IKKβ heterodimer followed by assays of kinase activity using the GST-IκB substrate (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Apoptosis assay was measured with Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using procedures suggested by the manufacturer with modifications. Briefly, HCT-15 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells per well overnight. Cells were treated with reagents including aspirin (5 mm), salicylate (5 mm), sulindac (1 mm), ibuprofen (25 μm), and indomethacin (25 μm) for the indicated periods. After incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested from the plates. Cells were lysed 30 min at room temperature, and the lysates were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. Then 20 μl of the supernatant was transferred into streptavidin-coated 96-well plates provided by the manufacturer, and 80 μl of the immunoreagents containing anti-histone conjugated with biotin and anti-DNA conjugated with peroxidase was added to each well. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, plates were washed three times with wash buffer. Peroxidase was determined photometrically with 2,2′-azinodi[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] as substrate using microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader at wavelength of 410 nm. The values from duplicate samples were averaged and subtracted from those of background (samples without lysates). The results were expressed as the enrichment factor using the following formula: absorbance of the sample (dying/dead cells)/absorbance of the control cells (without treatment). Aspirin and sodium salicylate, but not indomethacin, inhibit NF-κB-directed gene expression (24Grilli M. Pizzi M. Memo M. Spano P.

Recently, we extended these studies and demonstrated that the effects of aspirin and sodium salicylate are mediated by the direct binding of these agents to IKKβ to decrease its kinase activity (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Since aspirin and sulindac both have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects, we investigated whether sulindac could also inhibit activation of the NF-κB pathway. Such a result could help explain previous data demonstrating that sulindac sulfide can induce apoptosis in the colon cancer cell line HCT-15 which lacks cyclooxygenases (37Hanif R. Pittas A. Feng Y. Koutsos M.I. Qiao L. Staiano-Coico L. Shiff S.I. Riggs B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). First, we compared the effects of sulindac, aspirin, salicylate, indomethacin, and ibuprofen on the expression of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat reporter construct that contains two NF-κB sites. The concentration of sulindac necessary to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines ranges from 400 to 1200 μm (44Shiff S.J. Qiao L. Tsai L.L. Rigas B. J. Clin.

At these concentrations, sulindac does not cause cell death, and its effects on cell proliferation are reversible after removing the drug (44Shiff S.J. Qiao L. Tsai L.L. Rigas B. J. Clin.

Approximately 4–6-fold lower concentrations of the sulfide metabolite of sulindac (100–200 μm) inhibit cell proliferation (44Shiff S.J. Qiao L. Tsai L.L. Rigas B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 45Goldberg Y. Nassif H.I. Pittas A. Tsai L.L. Dynlacht B.D. Rigas B. Shiff S.J.

In the analysis described below, we used a concentration of 1,000 μm for both sulindac and sulindac sulfone and a concentration of 200 μm for sulindac sulfide. These concentrations of sulindac and its metabolites resulted in reversible effects on cellular proliferation (data not shown). The concentrations of aspirin (1–5 mm), indomethacin (25 μm), and ibuprofen (25 μm) were based on the pharmacologic concentrations of these agents in the serum of patients required for their anti-inflammatory properties (26Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). An NF-κB reporter was transfected into COS cells that were treated with known activators of the NF-κB pathway. These included either TNFα (50Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), the MAP3 kinases NIK (51Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar) or MEKK1 (52Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T.

Each of these activators stimulated NF-κB-directed gene expression from 10- to 40-fold (Fig. 1, A and B). These activators did not stimulate the expression of an HIV-1 reporter containing mutated NF-κB sites (data not shown). Treatment of the cells with either aspirin or salicylate reduced TNFα-directed NF-κB gene expression approximately 4-fold (Fig.1 A). Treatment of the cells with either sulindac or sulindac sulfone also reduced TNFα induction of NF-κB gene expression about 4-fold (Fig. 1 A). Sulindac sulfide resulted in approximately a 10-fold decrease in NF-κB-directed gene expression (Fig.1 A). Similar levels of inhibition were seen with these agents when NF-κB gene expression was activated by NIK expression in cells treated with either aspirin, sodium salicylate, sulindac, or the sulfide and sulfone metabolites of sulindac (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, two other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, indomethacin and ibuprofen, did not reduce TNFα stimulation of NF-κB-directed gene expression (Fig. 1 A). MEKK1 and Tax activation of the NF-κB pathway was also inhibited 4–6-fold by treatment of cells with either aspirin, sodium salicylate, sulindac, or sulindac sulfone (Fig. 1 B). Sulindac sulfide consistently resulted in a 2–3-fold greater level of inhibition of the NF-κB pathway than seen with aspirin, salicylate, or sulindac sulfone (Fig. 1, A and B). Neither indomethacin nor ibuprofen reduced Tax or MEKK1 induction of NF-κB-directed gene expression (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that sulindac and its sulfone and sulfide metabolites, like aspirin and sodium salicylate, inhibit activation of the NF-κB pathway in response to a variety of well characterized inducers of this pathway. Next it was important to address the mechanism by which sulindac inhibited the NF-κB pathway. Nuclear extract was prepared from either untreated COS cells, COS cells treated with TNFα, or COS cells transfected with NIK. Gel retardation analysis was performed with nuclear extract prepared from these cells using oligonucleotides corresponding to either NF-κB- or SP-1-binding sites. TNFα treatment of cells induced binding to the wild-type NF-κB oligonucleotide (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 2) but not to a mutant NF-κB oligonucleotide (data not shown). Stimulation of NF-κB binding in response to TNFα was inhibited by incubation of the cells with either aspirin, salicylate, or sulindac (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–5) but not ibuprofen or indomethacin (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and 7). Similar inhibition of NF-κB binding by treatment of cells with either aspirin, salicylate, or sulindac was seen when the NF-κB pathway was activated by NIK transfection (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9–14). None of these agents altered SP1 binding in the gel retardation assay (Fig.2 A, lower panel). These results indicated that sulindac, like aspirin and salicylate, inhibited NF-κB nuclear translocation. Assays were performed to investigate whether sulindac altered the degradation of IκBα when COS cells were treated with either TNFα or following transfection of COS cells with a NIK expression vector. TNFα treatment markedly reduced IκBα levels at 30 min post-treatment when compared with the IκBα levels seen in untreated COS cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). Treatment of the COS cells with either aspirin, salicylate, or sulindac prevented TNFα-induced IκBα degradation (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5). In contrast, treatment of cells with either indometh"

We have found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and its direct activator MKK6 are rapidly activated in response to TGF-beta. Expression of dominant negative MKK6 or dominant negative TAK1 inhibited the TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation as well as the p38 activation. Constitutive activation of the p38 pathway in the absence of TGF-beta induced the transcriptional activation, which was enhanced synergistically by coexpression of Smad2 and Smad4 and was inhibited by expression of the C-terminal truncated, dominant negative Smad4. Furthermore, we have found that activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), which is known as a nuclear target of p38, becomes phosphorylated in the N-terminal activation domain in response to TGF-beta, that ATF-2 forms a complex with Smad4, and that the complex formation is enhanced by TGF-beta. In addition, expression of a nonphosphorylatable form of ATF-2 inhibited the TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation. These results show that the p38 pathway is activated by TGF-beta and is involved in the TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation by regulating the Smad-mediated pathway."

In the summer of 1998-99, the peak sunburning UV radiation was about 12 percent more than in the first years of the decade. Larger increases were seen for DNA-damaging UV radiation and plant-damaging UV radiation, whereas UV-A (315 to 400 nanometers) radiation, which is insensitive to ozone, showed no increase, in agreement with model calculations. These results provide strong evidence of human-induced increases in UV radiation, in a region where baseline levels of UV radiation were already relatively high."

By collecting the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of these labeled receptors in the presence and absence of the ligand aspartate, ligand binding was shown to generate an approximately 1 angstrom intrasubunit piston-type movement of one transmembrane helix downward relative to the other transmembrane helix. The receptor-associated phosphorylation cascade proteins CheA and CheW did not alter the ligand-induced movement. Because the piston movement is very small, the ability of receptors to produce large outcomes in response to stimuli is caused by the ability of the receptor-coupled enzymes to detect small changes in the conformation of the receptor."

The entrainment by light of the circadian clock is mediated by a reduction in TIM levels. To elucidate the mechanism of this process, the sensitivity of TIM regulation by light was tested in an in vitro assay with inhibitors of candidate proteolytic pathways. The data suggested that TIM is degraded through a ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism. In addition, in cultures from third-instar larvae, TIM degradation was blocked specifically by inhibitors of proteasome activity. Degradation appeared to be preceded by tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, TIM was ubiquitinated in response to light in cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017370430,"90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase-2 (RSK2) belongs to a family of growth factor-activated serine/threonine kinases composed of two kinase domains connected by a regulatory linker region. The N-terminal kinase of RSK2 is involved in substrate phosphorylation. Its activation requires phosphorylation of the linker region at Ser<sup>369</sup>, catalyzed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and at Ser<sup>386</sup>, catalyzed by the C-terminal kinase, after its activation by ERK. In addition, the N-terminal kinase must be phosphorylated at Ser<sup>227</sup> in the activation loop by an as yet unidentified kinase. Here, we show that the isolated N-terminal kinase of RSK2 (amino acids 1–360) is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>227</sup> by PDK1, a constitutively active kinase, leading to 100-fold stimulation of kinase activity. In COS7 cells, ectopic PDK1 induced the phosphorylation of full-length RSK2 at Ser<sup>227</sup>and Ser<sup>386</sup>, without involvement of ERK, leading to partial activation of RSK2. Similarly, two other members of the RSK family, RSK1 and RSK3, were partially activated by PDK1 in COS7 cells. Finally, our data indicate that full activation of RSK2 by growth factor requires the cooperation of ERK and PDK1 through phosphorylation of Ser<sup>227</sup>, Ser<sup>369</sup>, and Ser<sup>386</sup>. Our study extend recent findings which implicate PDK1 in the activation of protein kinases B and C and p70<sup>S6K</sup>, suggesting that PDK1 controls several major growth factor-activated signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2090052545,Translational fidelity is established by ribosomal recognition of the codon-anticodon interaction within the aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) site (A site) of the ribosome. Experiments are presented that reveal possible contacts between 16S ribosomal RNA and the codon-anticodon complex. N1 methylation of adenine at position 1492 (A1492) and A1493 interfered with A-site tRNA binding. Mutation of A1492 and A1493 to guanine or cytosine also impaired A-site tRNA binding. The deleterious effects of A1492G or A1493G (or both) mutations were compensated by 2'fluorine substitutions in the mRNA codon. The results suggest that the ribosome recognizes the codon-anticodon complex by adenine contacts to the messenger RNA backbone and provide a mechanism for molecular discrimination of correct versus incorrect codon-anticodon pairs.

The reaction of nitric oxide (NO) with CP was investigated in view of nitrosothiol (RS-NO) formation. First, formation of heavy metal- or CP-catalyzed RS-NO was examined with physiologically relevant concentrations of NO and various thiol compounds (RSH) such as glutathione (GSH). Among the various heavy metal ions and copper-containing enzymes and proteins examined, only copper ion (Cu2+) and CP showed potent RS-NO (S-nitrosoglutathione)-producing activity. Also, RS-NO-forming catalytic activity was evident for CP added exogenously to RAW264 cells expressing inducible NO synthase in culture, but this was not the case for copper ion. Similarly, CP produced endogenously by HepG2 cells showed potent RS-NO-forming activity in the cell culture. One-electron oxidation of NO appears to be operative for RS-NO production via electron transfer from type 1 copper to a cluster of types 2 and 3 copper in CP. Neurological disorders are associated with aceruloplasminemia; besides RS-NO, S-nitrosoglutathione particularly has been shown to have neuroprotective effect against oxidative stress induced by iron overload.

Although one of the important functions of CP may be its ferroxidase-related activity for iron uptake, the physiological substrate for CP has not been fully identified, nor has the role of CP been fully understood. In the present study, we investigated metal- and CP-catalyzed RS-NO formation occurring under physiological conditions. We recently developed a sensitive and specific RS-NO assay by using HPLC coupled with a flow reactor system (28Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This assay used the flow reactor system with mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and the Griess reagent to detect various peaks of RS-NO eluted from a reverse phase C18 HPLC column. An aliquot (150 μl) was applied to an HPLC column, C18reverse phase (4.6 × 250 mm; TSK gel ODS-80Ts; Tosoh Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). To separate each RS-NO, the column was eluted with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.5 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid with 15% methanol at a flow rate of 0.55 ml/min. The eluate from the HPLC column, connected to a reaction coil, was mixed with a reactant solution containing 1.75 mm HgCl2 (to induce RS-NO decomposition to form NO2−) and Griess reagent; the mixture was fed through a three-way connector at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The diazo compound obtained was detected at 540 nm by using a visible light detector (Eicom Co., Ltd., Kyoto) and an integrator (System Instruments, Co., Ltd., Tokyo). CP was purified from plasma by using aminoethyl-derivatized Sepharose column chromatography according to the method reported previously (29Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Musci G. Giartosio A. D'Alessio S.

Hemocyanin from keyhole limpets (Megathura crenulata) was purchased from Sigma. All copper-containing proteins used in this study were more than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (33Sato K. Akaike T. Kohno M. Ando M. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25371-25377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The NO-releasing reaction was carried out by using propylamine P-NONOate (CH3N[N(O)NO]−(CH2)3NH2+CH3, 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3-(N-methyl-3-aminopropyl)-3-methyl-1-triazene; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) in 0.5 ml of 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The t12 of NO formation from P-NONOate in neutral phosphate buffer used in this experiment was 5 min. After 30 min of incubation of the reaction mixture containing various concentrations of P-NONOate, RSH, and CP, 5 μl of 50 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was added to the reaction mixture, which inhibited metal-catalyzed degradation of RS-NO. Aliquots (150 μl) were then applied to the HPLC column for RS-NO analysis just described. All buffers used in this experiment were treated with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove trace amounts of heavy metal contaminants. RS-NO produced extracellularly in RAW264 cells (a murine macrophage cell line) and HepG2 cells (a human hepatocyte cell line) was investigated by using the above-described HPLC-flow reactor system with Hg2+ and Griess reagent according to our earlier report (28Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RAW264 cells were cultured in 24-well plates (16-mm diameter; Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) with Dulbecco's MEM (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells at saturation density (1 × 106 cells/well) were stimulated with interferon-γ (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) at 100 units/ml and lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 026B; Difco) at 10 μg/ml for 12 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 95% air (v/v)). The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were further incubated in the CO2 incubator with 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.5 mml-arginine with or without various concentrations of RSH and/or CP at 37 °C. After incubation for 45 min, the reaction medium was harvested and mixed with the same volume of pure water containing 10% methanol and 1 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH 7.4), followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant (150 μl) was then applied to the HPLC flow reactor system. HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and nonessential amino acids at 37 °C in the CO2incubator and plated into 12-well plate (22-mm diameter; Falcon) at the initial density of 1 × 106 cells/well. After overnight culture, the confluent monolayer of the cells were rinsed with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer three times, and each well received 500 μl of DMEM plus nonessential amino acid. After 24-h and 48-h cultures of the cells, GS-NO formation in the HepG2 cell culture was tested in the presence of NO, added exogenously by two means. First, the culture medium was harvested, and its supernatant, obtained by centrifugation (10,000 × g), was reacted with 10 μm P-NONOate and various concentrations of GSH at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was carried out in the 12-well plate without HepG2 cells. The amount of GS-NO generated during the reaction was then quantified by HPLC flow reactor system as described above. Second, GSH and P-NONOate were administered to the culture medium on the monolayered cells, followed by incubation of the whole cell culture for 30 min at 37 °C, and then the GS-NO formed in the medium was measured. Because significant NO production from HepG2 cells was not detected (NO2− and NO3− production/48 h <1 μm) under our experimental conditions employed, as assessed by NO2−/NO3−measurement of the culture medium (HPLC flow reactor analysis) (28Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we used P-NONOate as a source of exogenous NO supply in the HepG2 cell culture. Furthermore, to confirm the involvement of CP in the GS-NO formation in cultured HepG2 cells, the supernatant of the medium was immunoprecipitated with the use of a specific anti-CP polyclonal IgG antibody (Biogenesis Ltd., Poole, UK). Briefly, supernatant of the medium was incubated with the anti-CP antibody (0.8 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and precipitated by using an immunoprecipitation kit (IMMUNOcatcherTM; Cytosignal, Irvine, CA). After the precipitated antigen (CP) was removed, the resultant supernatant was subjected to GS-NO formation assay as described above. As a control study, rabbit nonprimed IgG was reacted with the culture medium in a same manner as anti-CP antibody, followed by the GS-NO formation assay. The supernatant of the culture medium obtained from HepG2 cells was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% polyacrylamide gel) under reducing condition, as reported earlier (33Sato K. Akaike T. Kohno M. Ando M. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25371-25377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, protein was transferred to ImmobilonTM polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Co., Ltd., Bedford, MA). The membrane was incubated with anti-CP IgG (1:1,000 dilution) as primary antibody, then with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000; Sigma) followed by incubation with avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (1:10,000; Sigma). The immunoreactive band was visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates for alkaline phosphatase. Immunoblots were quantified by a densitometrical analysis, as compared with the immunoreactive band of standard purified CP (34Okamoto T. Akaike Nagano T. Miyajima S. Suga M. Ando M. Ichimori K. Maeda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture containing human CP (50 μm) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was evacuated and treated with argon gas to remove O2 dissolved in the solution, followed by incubation with P-NONOate (500 μm) at room temperature. After 15 min of incubation, a 600-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was transferred to the quartz sample tube, immediately frozen, and then subjected to EPR spectroscopy at 110 K. The EPR study was performed by using X-band Bruker ESP 380E. The effect of proteolytic treatment on CP enzyme activity was tested by measuring its amine oxidase activity according to a previously described method (35Musci G. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Calabrese L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Specifically, CP from different species (human, rabbit, and rat) at 6 mg/ml were treated with human plasmin (Sigma) at 60 μg/ml in 0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 7.0) plus 0.1 mNaCl at 37 °C for 2 h. An aliquot (50 μl) of the reaction mixture was then added to 1.5 ml of 100 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 9.2 mm p-phenylenediamine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) as substrate, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. After the reaction was stopped by the addition of NaN3 at 24 mm, the oxidation of p-phenylenediamine was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. Simultaneously, GS-NO-producing activity of CP treated or untreated with plasmin was measured as described above. Proteolysis of CP by plasmin was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing condition. Similarly, the amine oxidase and RS-NO-producing activities of CP with or without peroxynitrite (ONOO−) treatment were determined. CP (10 μm) was incubated with 1.5 mm ONOO−, which was synthesized as reported previously (36Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 10 min, and then its amine oxidase activity and RS-NO production were assessed. First, to explore the RS-NO-generating system, we examined RS-NO formation catalyzed by heavy metal ions by using a mixture of glutathione (GSH) and P-NONOate (10 μm), an NO-releasing compound, with or without various heavy metal ions including iron and copper (0.5 μm each) in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (Fig.1 A). Appreciable GS-NO formation was observed only with Cu2+ (CuSO4) at a concentration of 0.5 μm. Although ferrous iron (Fe2+) was reported to catalyze RS-NO generation via formation of complexes of dinitrosyl iron and sulfur (37Vanin A.F. Malenkova I.V. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1996; 61: 374-379Google Scholar, 38Vanin A.F. Malenkova I.V. Serezhenkov V.A. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), both Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions did not show effective GS-NO formation, at least with the low concentration of NO used in this study. We then tested the copper-containing protein CP for activity in RS-NO formation by use of a cell-free NO-releasing system with P-NONOate. CP purified from human plasma catalyzed significant GS-NO formation in a concentration-dependent fashion, and its activity was comparable to that of free Cu2+ ion at concentrations less than 1.0 μm in the cell-free reaction mixture (Fig.1 B). Other mammalian CPs (from rabbits and rats) also showed potent RS-NO-producing activities (Fig. 1 C). It is of considerable interest that an increase in GS-NO formation (by 2-fold) was observed after the addition of physiological concentrations of NaCl (0.1–0.2 m) to the reaction mixture with CP but not to the free Cu2+ reaction system (data not shown). Similar enhancement of the catalytic activity of CP by NaCl was reported for ferroxidase and amine oxidase (35Musci G. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Calabrese L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For quantitative comparison of the catalytic activity of CP with that of Cu2+ for RS-NO production, RS-NO formation was examined as just described by varying the concentration of each reactant, P-NONOate and RSH as substrates and CP and Cu2+ as catalysts, for RS-NO generation. In these experiments, both GSH and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were used as low molecular weight thiol substrates for S-nitrosylation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, an almost linear increase in each RS-NO adduct (GS-NO and NAC-NO) was observed, in parallel to the concentration of CP or Cu2+ in the presence of RSH (10 μm) and P-NONOate (10 μm). RS-NO formation as catalyzed by CP was much higher than that catalyzed by Cu2+. The amount of RS-NO generated reached a plateau or declined, however, when CP or Cu2+concentrations exceeded 2 μm. Similarly, CP showed more effective RS-NO generation than did free Cu2+ ion in the presence of various concentrations of NAC or GSH (data not shown). Very little RS-NO was produced without CP or Cu2+ (Fig.2 A). The percentage of RS-NO yield from free NO ranged from 20 to 40% and from 50 to 70% (RS-NO/NO) for GS-NO and NAC-NO, respectively. Maximum production of RS-NO was achieved with NAC. 69.1 ± 3.3% NO was converted to NAC-NO in the reaction of 2.5 μm P-NONOate and 10 μm NAC in 0.1m phosphate buffer plus 0.1 m NaCl (pH 7.4) in the presence of 2.0 μm CP. An appreciable amount of NO was converted to RS-NO by CP even at the nanomolar range of NO, whereas very little RS-NO formation was observed in the absence of CP (data not shown). In general, RS-NO formation was greater with NAC-NO than with GS-NO. These results suggest that CP works effectively for RS-NO formation with NO and RSH. When GS-NO and NAC-NO are formed, however, they appear to be partly degraded by Cu2+ or actually by Cu1+ as reported previously (10Williams D.L.H. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 299-308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, CP and Cu2+ can catalyze both synthesis and degradation of RS-NO, with RS-NO synthesis catalyzed by CP predominating compared with degradation under these physiological reaction conditions. In fact, CP decomposed RS-NO much less effectively than did Cu2+ ions in the presence of RSH (Fig. 2 B). To further examine the production of RS-NO as catalyzed by CP in biological systems, the murine macrophage cell line RAW264 was studied in culture with or without CP. RAW264 cells were stimulated with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide to express inducible NO synthase (28Akaike T. Inoue K. Okamoto T. Nishino H. Otagiri M. Fujii S. Maeda H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Then, extracellular RS-NO generation was measured in the supernatant of the culture medium with or without the addition of RSH, according to our method (HPLC flow reaction). Typical elution profiles of RS-NO generated in the culture supernatant were shown in Fig.3 A. Very little extracellular GS-NO was formed without the addition of CP and RSH, except that low levels of GS-NO production (approximately 100 nm) was observed without CP addition in the culture with 50 μmGSH (Fig. 3 B). RS-NO formation increased in linear fashion, in parallel to the concentration of CP. In contrast, the addition of Cu2+ ion resulted in only marginally increased RS-NO production, even in the presence of exogenous NAC or GSH (Fig.3 B). Significantly high levels (>2 μm) of GS-NO generation from endogenous GSH by RAW264 cells became apparent when CP (2 μm) was added to the cell culture without exogenous GSH, and its formation increased in parallel to the concentration of GSH added to the cell culture together with CP (Fig.3 C). RS-NO formation was greater with NAC than with GSH, indicating that NAC is a better substrate than GSH for CP-catalyzed RS-NO production in cell culture. This result is consistent with RS-NO formation in the cell-free system as described above. The great efficacy of RS-NO generation from NAC may be due to the stability of NAC-NO; in a separate experiment, NAC-NO was less susceptible than GS-NO to Cu2+-catalyzed decomposition. It is of considerable interest that the concentration of NAC-NO formed reached one-third of the total concentration of NO-oxidized products (NO2−, NO3−, and RS-NO) in the reaction system of inducible NO synthase-expressed cells plus NAC and CP (data not shown). Moreover, GS-NO was formed efficiently by CP produced endogenously by HepG2 cells in culture. Specifically, GS-NO formation was observed clearly in the culture medium of the cells containing various concentrations of GSH, when NO was generated in the medium by the addition of P-NONOate (10 μm) (Fig.4). CP release from the cells into the medium was assessed by Western blotting and densitometrical analysis, and its time profile was correlated with that of the GS-NO-forming activity (Fig. 4 A). The amounts of CP produced in the medium were 80 ± 16 nm and 144 ± 17 nm(n = 4; means ± S.E.) for 24- and 48-h culture of the cells, respectively. These values are almost consistent with those reported previously (17Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Koj A. Korzus E. Baumann H. Nakamura T. Travis J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The GS-NO-producing activity recovered in the culture medium was increased in a time-dependent fashion after initiating cell culture (Fig. 4 B) and inhibited strongly by treatment of the medium with anti-CP antibody (by more than 90%) (Fig. 4 C) but not with nonprimed antibody (not shown), indicating that CP synthesized de novo by HepG2 cells in culture catalyzes RS-NO formation. The GS-NO-generating potential of CP produced by the cultured HepG2 cells is almost comparable with that of purified human CP; we found in a separate experiment that 100 nm purified CP generated almost 200 nm GS-NO from 10 μm P-NONOate and 100 μm GSH, and a similar range of GS-NO production was observed with the culture medium of HepG2 cells obtained after a 48-h culture, as shown in Fig. 4, B and C. CP-dependent GS-NO formation was reduced when P-NONOate was administered directly to the HepG2 cell culture (Fig. 4 B). This reduction seems to be due to intracellular incorporation (or transnitrosylation) of GS-NO formed extracellularly via the catalytic reaction of CP, because we observed a similar decrease in the concentration of authentic GS-NO that was given exogenously to the cell culture (not shown). It is also important that GS-NO formation from endogenous GSH was observed appreciably in the culture medium without addition of GSH (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that GS-NO could be readily formed by CP produced by the cells with concomitant NO generation under physiological conditions. Further studies were executed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NO oxidation and RS-NO generation by CP. We first investigated the interaction of NO with various types of copper ion in the CP molecule by EPR spectroscopy at 110 K. Human purified CP gives EPR spectra derived from type 1 and 2 copper, clearly identified on the basis of a characteristic four-line hyperfine pattern at g// regions. When human CP was reacted with NO derived from P-NONOate in a cell-free system under anaerobic conditions, the EPR signal intensity at both g// and g⊥ regions was attenuated, and the hyperfine structure of the type 1 signal was abolished, but an appreciable type 2 copper signal remained unaffected (data not shown). This is consistent with previous results and indicates that NO can react and bind with type 1 copper selectively (40Gorren A.C. de Boer E. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 38-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These data may be interpreted to suggest that an electron on the NO molecule that bound with the type 1 copper may be integrated into the electron orbit of the copper atom. Also, as"

Whereas the fast inhibitory response results from the activation of the postsynaptically localized GABAA receptors by triggering the opening of an integral Cl− channel, the slow GABA action is mediated by the metabotropic GABAB receptors. GABAB receptors can be localized pre- and postsynaptically, where they interact via G-proteins with a variety of effector systems (reviewed in Refs. 1Bowery N.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Postsynaptic GABAB receptors activate K+channels and regulate adenylyl cyclase. Presynaptic GABABreceptors inhibit the release of neurotransmitters by modulation of Ca2+ channels. Despite the various functions of GABAB receptors, molecular cloning initially revealed only two receptor subtypes generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. These variants of the GABAB receptor, termed GBR1a and GBR1b, differ solely in their N terminus, where the first 147 residues of GBR1a are replaced by a sequence of 18 different amino acids in GBR1b (3Kaupmann K.

However, GBR1a and GBR1b expressed in COS-1 cells displayed up to 150-fold lower affinity for agonists compared with native GABAB receptors, and coupling of GBR1 to certain effector systems was difficult to demonstrate (3Kaupmann K.

Thus, unlike other G-protein-coupled receptors, functional GABAB receptors appear to be heteromers formed from two related seven-transmembrane domain proteins, GBR1 and GBR2. However, there is evidence that also GBR1a and GBR1b alone were able to couple to K+ channels or adenylyl cyclase, although at low efficiency (3Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S.

In addition, GBR2 expressed in HEK 293 cells was found to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in the presence of GABA (8Kuner R. Köhr G. Grünewald S. Eisenhardt G. Bach A. Kornau H.-C. Science. 1999; 283: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Thus, GABAB receptors with monomeric or diverse, yet unknown, heteromeric structures may occur in vivo. It was therefore tested whether both GBR1a and GBR1b are associated with GBR2 in situ and whether GBR1a and GBR1b may be co-assembled to provide further receptor heterogeneity. In addition, it was analyzed whether the GABAB receptor components GBR1a, GBR1b, or GBR2 may also be present as monomers in situ and thereby contribute to further receptor heterogeneity. Finally, the regional and subcellular distributions of GBR1a, GBR1b, and GBR2 were analyzed to detect possible differential localizations, which may point to distinct functions of GABAB receptor subtypes. For this purpose variant-selective antisera were used to immunobiochemically characterize the GBR1a and GBR1b subtypes and their relationship to GBR2. The results indicate that GBR1a and GBR1b represent distinct GABAB receptor subtypes, which are targeted to largely different subcellular locations. Both GBR1a and GBR1b exist as heterodimers in combination with GBR2. There was no evidence for the presence of a major population of monomeric receptors. Most remarkably, after solubilization, the two GABABreceptor variants were both found to exist in two forms differing in molecular size. Thus, receptor-associated components may contribute further to the heterogeneity of GABAB receptors. For production of variant-specific antisera the following peptides were custom-synthesized (ANAWA Trading SA, Switzerland): N-terminal amino acids 83–107 of the GBR1a variant (sequence, CSKSYLTLENGKVFLTGGDLPALDG), N-terminal amino acids 1–18 of the GBR1b variant (sequence, SHSPHLPRPHPRVPPHPS containing an additional cysteine at the C terminus), and the C-terminal amino acids 922–944 common to both GABAB receptor variants (sequence, PRGPSEPPDRLSSDGSRVHLLYK, containing an additional cysteine at the N terminus; a naturally occurring cysteine at position 13 was exchanged by a serine to allow defined coupling to the carrier protein). The peptides were coupled via the cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunizing rabbits as described previously (13Benke D. Mertens S. Trceziak A. Gillessen D. Mohler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4478-4483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All resulting antisera were purified by affinity chromatography using the peptide antigens coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose 6B as matrix (13Benke D. Mertens S. Trceziak A. Gillessen D. Mohler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4478-4483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For detection of GBR2, affinity purified antiserum AbC22 (GBR2 antiserum) was used, which was raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the amino acids 806–907 of GBR2 (for details see Ref. 7Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P. Mosbacher J. Bischoff S. Kulik A. Shigemoto R. Karshin A. Bettler B. Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Brain tissue from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) was homogenized in 10 volumes of 5 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged for 15 min at 1000 × g. The crude membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the resulting supernatant for 30 min at 17,000 × g. The membranes were washed twice with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, resuspended in the same buffer to give a protein concentration of about 5 mg/ml, and stored at −30 °C. Subcellular fractionation and isolation of postsynaptic densities (PSD) were done according to Ref. 14Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar. Cortex and hippocampus of adult rats were rapidly dissected and homogenized (10% w/v) in 0.32 msucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) by 12 up and down strokes with a motor-operated Teflon-glass homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g, and the resulting pellet (P1) was washed once with buffer A by homogenization and centrifugation for 10 min at 755 ×g. The combined supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 17,300 × g resulting in the crude membrane preparation (P2). The pellet was washed once in buffer A, resuspended in 0.32m sucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3 (buffer B) and centrifuged for 120 min at 100,000 × g on discontinuous sucrose gradients (each 9 ml contained 1.2, 1, and 0.85m sucrose containing 1 mm NaHCO3). The band between 1.0 and 1.2 m sucrose was removed, diluted with buffer B, and centrifuged for 20 min at 48,200 ×g. The resulting synaptosomal membranes (SPM) were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.3, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to a protein concentration of 4 mg/ml, stirred on ice for 15 min, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 48,200 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, and postsynaptic densities (PSD) were isolated by centrifugation for 120 min at 275,000 × g on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (each 3 ml contained 2, 1.5, and 1 m sucrose containing 1 mm NaHCO3). The PSD fraction (band between 1.5 and 2 m sucrose) was diluted to 5.5 ml with H2O followed by addition of an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm KCl, incubated for 60 min on ice and pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 275,000 × g. Further subcellular fractions were prepared as follows. The supernatant of the crude membrane preparation (S2) was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g to obtain microsomal membranes (P3) and the cytosolic fraction (S3). The synaptosomal fraction (SPM) was resuspended in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100 and subjected to osmotic lysis for 60 min on ice followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 48,200 × g resulting in the lysed synaptosomal membranes (LP1) and the cytosolic synaptosomal fraction (LS1). Aliquots of the crude membranes or subcellular fractions were incubated for 15 min at 60 °C with an equal volume of 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 7.5% mini-gels (Mini Protean II, Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes in a semi-dry electro-blotting apparatus (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 60 min using 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.04% SDS as transfer buffer. For immunodetection, the blots were blocked for 1–2 h in TBST (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk (=blocker) at room temperature, followed by incubation with affinity purified antisera overnight at 4 °C in TBST, 5% blocker. The blots were washed one time for 10 min with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.4% deoxycholate and three times with TBST. Incubation with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:5000 in TBST, 5% blocker; Promega) was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Following extensive washing (see above), immunoreactivity was detected by the chemiluminescence method (Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus; NEN Life Science Products). Quantification of immunoreactive bands was performed with a high resolution computer-based image analysis system (MCID M2, Imaging Research, Ontario, Canada). To ensure an analysis in the linear ranges, x-ray films were exposed to Western blots of increasing protein concentrations (2.5–40 μg) for various times. For solubilization of GABAB receptors, crude membranes were thawed and washed once with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mg/l bacitracin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.3 mg/liter aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.05% phosphatidylcholine and resuspended in the same buffer to give a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. Following addition of the detergent (either 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% CHAPS, 2% BigCHAP, 2% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside or RIPA (0.5% sodium deoxycholate), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS; final concentrations), the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the remaining pellet was resuspended in buffer to the original volume. To test the solubilization efficiency, equal aliquots of the supernatant and pellet were subjected to Western blotting. Linear gradients were prepared from 5 and 20% sucrose in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% NaN3 containing either 0.1% deoxycholate or 0.5% Triton X-100. Deoxycholate extracts of brain membranes (200 μl, see above) were layered on the top of each gradient and were centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 14 h at 4 °C. At the end of the centrifugation, fractions of 300 μl were collected and analyzed for GBR1 and GBR2 immunoreactivity (IR) by Western blotting. For calibration, marker proteins (2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, aldolase, and catalase, were dissolved in 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mg/liter bacitracin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.3 mg/liter aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.05% phosphatidylcholine, 0.5% deoxycholate and applied to gradients run in parallel. The presence of marker proteins in each fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE and by measuring the optical density of the fractions at a wavelength of 280 nm. In addition, the position of GABAA receptors was determined by Western blotting using antisera against the α1- and α3-subunits (15Benke D. Cicin-Sain A. Mertens S. Mohler H. J. Recept. Res. 1991; 11: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For construction of a GBR1b-specific immunoaffinity column, affinity purified antibodies were coupled to protein A-agarose as described previously (16Mertens S. Benke D. Mohler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5965-5973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude membranes prepared from whole rat brain were solubilized in 0.5% deoxycholate as described above and circulated through the columns overnight at 4 °C. The columns were extensively washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.02% NaN3 followed by 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% deoxycholate. Bound receptors were eluted with 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 11.5, 0.5 m urea, 0.1% deoxycholate, immediately neutralized with 1 m NaH2PO4, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centricon 30 concentrators, Amicon Inc.), and subjected to Western blot analysis. The regional distribution of the GBR1a, GBR1b, and GBR2 proteins in the adult rat brain was analyzed using the histoblot technique as described previously (17Wenzel A. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 18Wenzel A. Villa M. Mohler H. Benke D. J.

Parasagittal cryostat-cut sections (16 μm) of rat brains were collected onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm, Bio-Rad) and kept frozen at −30 °C until use. For protein transfer, the frozen nitrocellulose sheets containing the brain sections were moistened with 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 20% methanol, 2% SDS and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. After 2 h of incubation in TBST, 5% blocker, the blots were washed with TBST and incubated overnight with gentle agitation in 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature to remove the brain tissue and denature the proteins bound to the nitrocellulose membranes. Following washing with TBST, histoblots were processed for immunostaining with the GBR1a-, GBR1b-, GBR1a/b-, and GBR2-selective antisera as described for Western blotting. Human embryonic kidney cells (ATCC CRL 1573, 293 cells) were grown on culture dishes (9 cm) in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin. Cells were transfected with 30 μg of GBR1a or GBR1b variant expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. For harvesting, culture dishes were washed with ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by scraping the cells in buffer and centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until used. For Western blotting, the cells were thawed, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmKCl, homogenized, and washed twice with buffer. Affinity purified polyclonal antisera directed against the GABAB receptor splice variants GBR1a and GBR1b were generated using synthetic peptides derived from the N-terminal domain, which differs between the two splice variants (GBR1a-(83–107) and GBR1b-(1–18)). In addition, an antiserum was raised against the C terminus common to both splice variants (GBR1a,b-(922–944)). On Western blots of crude rat brain membranes, the GBR1a-(83–107) antiserum detected a broad protein band of 130 kDa, the GBR1b-(1–18) antiserum a broad protein band of 100 kDa, and the GBR1a,b-(922–944) antiserum correspondingly two proteins of 100 and 130 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 A). The immunoreactivities (IR) were completely prevented by co-incubation of the antisera with the corresponding peptide antigens underscoring the specificity of the antisera (Fig. 1 A). Since the GBR1a-(83–107) and GBR1b-(1–18) antisera recognized proteins of distinct sizes, a cross-reactivity of the antisera was not expected. To assess further the variant selectivity of the antisera, human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells were transfected with the GBR1a or GBR1b clone and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of the respective variants. In HEK 293 cells expressing the GBR1a variant, a 130-kDa protein was stained by the GBR1a-(83–107) and GBR1a,b-(922–944) antisera, whereas no IR was found with the GBR1b-(1–18) antiserum (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, in HEK 293 cells expressing the GBR1b variant, a 100-kDa protein was detected with the GBR1b-(1–18) and GBR1a,b-(922–944) antisera, but no IR was observed with the GBR1a-(83–107) antiserum (Fig. 1 B). In controls with non-transfected cells none of the antisera showed an IR. Thus, the GBR1a-(83–107) and GBR1b-(1–18) antisera were specific for the GABAB receptors' splice variants GBR1a and GBR1b and lacked any cross-reactivity. The selectivity of the GBR2 antiserum was described previously (7Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P. Mosbacher J. Bischoff S. Kulik A. Shigemoto R. Karshin A. Bettler B. Nature. 1998; 396: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Recent studies on mainly recombinant receptors indicated that fully functional GABAB receptors are heterodimers assembled from GBR1 and GBR2 (7Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W.

To test whether an association of GBR1 with GBR2 also holds for the native GABAB receptor variants, immunopurification experiments were performed. As a prerequisite, optimal solubilization conditions were determined. Crude brain membranes were treated with different detergents followed by Western blot analysis of both the extract and insoluble material using the GBR1a,b-(922–944) antiserum. Among the detergents tested, the ionic detergent deoxycholate (0.5%) and the detergent mixture RIPA (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) solubilized both GABAB receptor variants most efficiently (Fig. 2). All non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents tested (1% Triton X-100, 2% CHAPS, 2% BigCHAP, and 2% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) were considerably less effective in solubilization (Fig. 2). There was no apparent difference in the efficiency of extracting GBR1a compared with GBR1b. Thus, deoxycholate was the detergent of choice for solubilization of both GABAB receptor variants. Increasing the deoxycholate concentration to 1.5% and the ionic strength to 1m NaCl did not improve the solubilization efficiency (not shown). Quantification of the amount of solubilized GABABreceptor protein by densitometric analysis of Western blots revealed that 58 ± 5% (n = 6) of the GBR1a variant and 56 ± 5% (n = 6) of the GBR1b variant were solubilized by 0.5% deoxycholate. The ability of GBR1a and GBR1b to associate with GBR2 was analyzed by immunoprecipitating GABAB receptors from deoxycholate extracts of brain membranes using the GBR2 antiserum. In the well washed immunoprecipitate an IR for both GBR1a and GBR1b was detected on Western blots with the GBR1a,b-(922–944) antiserum, demonstrating that both GBR1a and GBR1b are associated with GBR2 in native GABAB receptors (Fig.3 A). In addition, the possible presence of trimeric receptors made up of GBR1a, GBR1b, and GBR2 was investigated. For this purpose, immunoaffinity chromatography of deoxycholate extracts of brain membranes was performed using GBR1b antibodies coupled to protein A-agarose. GBR1b antibodies were chosen for construction of the immunoaffinity column since GBR1a antibodies lost their activity upon coupling to protein A-agarose. Following extensive washing of the column, bound proteins were eluted with 0.1m Na2HPO4, pH 11.5, and analyzed by Western blotting. On Western blots of receptors immunoisolated with GBR1b antibodies, only signals for GBR1b and GBR2 were observed but not for GBR1a (Fig. 3 B). Consequently, GBR1a and GBR1b do not appear to co-assemble to a measurable extent in situ. Thus, native GBR1a and GBR1b represent distinct receptor subtypes, which are both associated with GBR2 to form heteromers in situ. To assess whether the constituent proteins of GABAB receptors, in addition to forming heteromers, may also occur as monomers or homo-oligomers, the molecular size of native solubilized receptors was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Proteins of rat brain membranes were extracted with 0.5% deoxycholate and subjected to 5–20% linear sucrose density gradient centrifugation, followed by an analysis of the pattern of distribution of GBR1a and GBR1b and GBR2. Western blotting revealed IR for GBR1a, GBR1b, and GBR2 in the same fractions, pointing to their co-sedimentation. The relative staining intensity of GBR2 roughly corresponded to that of GB1a and GB1b IR, in line with the association of GBR1 and GBR2 (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, the two GBR1 proteins and the GBR2 protein were present in two distinct peaks. The first broad peak, containing the majority of GBR1a, GBR1b, and GBR2 proteins, migrated to a position between that of the marker proteins aldolase (158 kDa) and catalase (232 kDa) and overlapped with GABAA receptors as marker protein (∼250 kDa). The second receptor fraction migrated slightly further into the gradient than the GABAA receptor marker, suggesting a molecular size of >250 kDa. The two molecular forms of GABAB receptors were found irrespective of the detergent used. Solubil"

Although this pathogen secretes a number of toxic proteins, including deoxyribonuclease and hyaluronidase, the lethal, cytolytic alpha toxin is implicated as the major virulence factor and appears to be the immunodominant extracellular antigen (3Ballard J.

In addition to their ability to form channels in target cell membranes, aerolysin and alpha toxin share several other properties, despite the fact that they are produced by bacteria widely separated in evolution. Both proteins are secreted from the bacteria as protoxins, and both are activated by proteolytic nicking near their C termini (5Ballard J. Sokolov Y. Yuan W.L. Kagan B.L. Tweten R.K. Mol.

The protein consists of two lobes, a small lobe containing the first 80 amino acids of the protein and a larger lobe containing the rest of the protein. A number of studies have shown that the large lobe is involved in oligomerization of the toxin, as well as in activation (10van der Goot F.G. Lakey J. Pattus F. Kay C.M. Sorokine O. Van Dorsselaer A. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8566-8570Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Buckley J.T. Wilmsen H.U. Lesieur C. Schulze A. Pattus F. Parker M.W. van der Goot F.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16450-16455Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Remarkably, alpha toxin shares extensive sequence homology with the large lobe of aerolysin, accounting for some of the functional similarities between the toxins. Indeed, one of us has speculated that the two toxins have a common ancestor and that aerolysin obtained its smaller lobe by domain swapping (12Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R.J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Recently a common fold has been observed in the small lobe of aerolysin and the S2 and S3 subunits of pertussis toxin (12Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R.J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This fold is similar to the carbohydrate recognition domains of a number of proteins, implying it has a binding function in both toxins. In the last several years, Howard and Buckley (13Howard S.P. Buckley J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1662-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) showed that receptors that can bind aerolysin with high affinity can account for the sensitivity of some mammalian cells to the toxin, and also in the last several years, a number of aerolysin receptors have been identified on sensitive cells. These proteins appear to be unrelated except for one remarkable property: they are all attached to the cell surface by means of C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 anchors. Examples are Thy-1 (CD90), which is found in T-lymphocytes and brain (14Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the neuronal surface molecule contactin (15Diep D.B. Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Pleshak E.N. Buckley J.T.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the glycosyl portion of the receptor is the major binding determinant for aerolysin. Cell lines that lack the ability to make GPI anchors are much less sensitive to aerolysin (14Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), as are cells that have been treated with phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (15Diep D.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2355-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which can remove most GPI-anchored proteins (17Low M.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Gordon et al. (7Gordon V.M. Benz R. Fujii K. Leppla S.H. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) explored the cellular requirements for alpha toxin sensitivity. One requirement is the presence of functional proteases to accomplish the conversion of the proform of the protein to the active toxin. Cells that lack furin, a surface protease that can correctly nick the protoxin, are lysed more slowly than those that express the protease (7Gordon V.M. Benz R. Fujii K. Leppla S.H. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another requirement for sensitivity is the ability of cells to localize alpha toxin on the cell surface, presumably through specific receptors. Until this time, no receptors have been identified for alpha toxin. Characterization of the receptors for other toxins has been aided by somatic cell mutagenesis methods (18Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Somat. Cell Genet. 1979; 5: 453-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S.

In this communication, we describe isolation and characterization of an alpha toxin-resistant CHO cell that is unable to bind the toxin. We show that the mutant cells lack the ability to synthesize GPI anchors and provide other evidence that GPI-anchored proteins are receptors for alpha toxin. C. septicum alpha toxin was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (20Ballard J. Crabtree J. Roe B.A. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 340-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For biotinylation, 6 mg of alpha toxin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 9.0, was reacted with 1 mg of sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (Pierce, catalog no. 21335) for 2 h on ice. Toxicity tests showed that the biotinylated toxin was fully active. Aerolysin was purified from A. hydrophila as described previously (21Buckley J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PI-PLC was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Murine T lymphocyte cell lines AKR1 and EL4 and their derivatives, AKR1 (Thy-1−d) and EL4 (Thy-1−f), were generously provided by Dr. R. Hyman (Salk Institute). The murine T lymphocyte cell lines BW5147.3 and BW5147.3(Thy-1−e).10 were purchased from the ATCC. Lymphocyte cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g of glucose per liter, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (either 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin, or 50 μg/ml gentamicin). The CHO cell line transfected with the human folate receptor, referred to here as CHO FR+, is the previously described CHO clone 2–8 (22Chung K.N. Roberts S. Kim C.H. Kirassova M. Trepel J. Elwood P.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Biofluids, Inc.) supplemented with 10% Fetal Clone II (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. CHO lec2 cells (23Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) were purchased from the ATCC. CHO lec2 cells were selected sequentially with 5 μm thioguanine and then 2 mm ouabain to obtain spontaneous mutants sensitive to hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium and resistant to ouabain. These marked lines are considered “universal hybridizers,” because they can be fused to unmarked cells for complementation analyses. In such fusions, both parents are killed by the combination of ouabain and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium, whereas fusion products survive. The resulting cloned cell line, CHO lec2 UH, was used as the parent for mutagenesis. It did not differ from CHO lec2 in toxin sensitivity, so these two lines were used interchangeably as controls in cytotoxicity comparisons with the mutant CHO cell line described below. CHO lec2 UH cells were treated in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene with four additions of a stock of a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector designated BAG (24Price J. Turner D. Cepko C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This vector expresses β-galactosidase from the viral LTR promoter and the neo gene from an SV40 promoter. Three days later, the cells were exposed to 10 ng/ml alpha toxin for 24 h. Dead cells and medium were removed, fresh medium was added, and the dishes were left undisturbed for 7 days. Colonies of surviving cells were expanded in 24-well dishes and tested for sensitivity to several toxins, resistance to G418, and for expression of β-galactosidase. Clones that were confirmed as resistant to alpha toxin and that expressed β-galactosidase were recloned by limiting dilution. One of these was designated CHO lec2 UH BAG15. One day prior to the assay, cells were detached from flasks using trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml in 96-well microtiter plates. The following day, toxin diluted in culture medium was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was assessed by the addition of 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described previously (7Gordon V.M. Benz R. Fujii K. Leppla S.H. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4130-4134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In assays in which CHO lec2 cells were treated with PI-PLC, adherent monolayers were incubated with 1 unit/ml PI-PLC for 60 min and then washed just prior to the addition of alpha toxin. Cells were aliquoted at 2 × 105cells/ml into 96-well microtiter plates and incubated with toxin dilutions for 1 h at 37 °C. Viability was measured by using either MTT or the combination of 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (Promega) with phenazine methosulphonate (Sigma). In the former case, MTT was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml, and the plates were incubated for an additional 2 h. An equal volume of lysing solution (20% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) dimethyl formamide, pH 4.7) was added, and the plates were incubated 2–16 h. Viability was assessed by measuring A540 and A650 and performing the following calculation: percentage of viability = 100 × (toxin-treated (A540 − A650) − background (A540 −A650))/(non-toxin-treated (A540 − A650) − background (A540 −A650)). In the latter method (25Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), the tetrazolium salt 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium and the electron acceptor phenazine methosulphate were added to final concentrations of 333 μg/ml and 25 μm, respectively. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h, after which A490 was measured. In assays for susceptibility of the toxin receptor to treatment with PI-PLC, 5 ml of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml were treated with 500 milliunits of PI-PLC per ml for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then pelleted by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, and cells were resuspended in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (100 μl) were then incubated with specified toxin concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C as described above. CHO lec2 and CHO lec2 UH BAG15 cells were aliquoted into 24-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/ml. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the plates were cooled to 4 °C. The medium was aspirated and 1 μg/ml biotinylated alpha toxin or 20 μg/ml native alpha toxin was added in precooled binding medium (minimum essential medium with Hanks' salts) (Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 11570), containing a low NaHCO3 concentration (4.5 mm), supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 4 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). After a 1.5-h incubation at 4 °C, the plate was washed 5 times with chilled binding medium. Phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Inc) or binding medium (200 μl) was added, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing with binding medium. The cells were detached from the surface of the plates using 500 μl of a nonproteolytic, EDTA-based solution (Cell Dissociation Solution, Life Technologies, Inc., catalog no. 13150-016), and analyzed for relative fluorescence using FACscan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The microsomal fraction was isolated from cells disrupted by nitrogen cavitation using differential centrifugation as described previously (26Stevens V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9718-9724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final microsomal pellets were resuspended and frozen in a solution of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol. Protein was quantitated using the bicinchoninic acid assay (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of GPI intermediates from UDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (1 μCi) by microsomes (approximately 60 μg of protein) was measured in a reaction mixture of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmtosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml tunicamycin, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm EDTA (total volume of 300 μl). Deacetylation of [3H]GlcNAc-PI (10,000 cpm), enzymatically prepared as described previously (26Stevens V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9718-9724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was measured using the same conditions except that ATP and EDTA were omitted from the reaction mixture. GTP (1 mm) and CoA (1 μm) were included as indicated. After incubation for the indicated time at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of H2O and 3 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1 (v/v)) containing 0.1 n HCl. The radiolabeled GPI precursors were then extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (28Bligh E.A. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC as described previously (29Stevens V.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31397-31403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat brain homogenate (1.0 ml) was treated with 400 milliunits of PI-PLC and centrifuged as described previously (14Nelson K.L. Raja S.M. Buckley J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12170-12174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Rat erythrocyte membranes were prepared as described previously (30Cowell S. Aschauer W. Gruber H.J. Nelson K.L. Buckley J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose using standard procedures. Two methods were used to detect materials that bind toxin. In the first method, used for Figs. 6, 10, and 11, blots were blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. All subsequent incubations were in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20. The blots were incubated with either aerolysin or alpha toxin, followed by polyclonal anti-aerolysin or anti-alpha toxin and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate. Blots were then developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the second method, used for Fig. 9, blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (w/v) dried skim milk, and all subsequent buffers contained 0.05% Tween 20. The blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated alpha toxin, washed, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of streptavidin (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.). The bound peroxidase was visualized with a tetramethylbenzidine reagent.Figure 10The alpha toxin binding folate receptor is released by PI-PLC.

Recent work showed that CHO cells contain a cryptic receptor for Moloney murine leukemia virus (31Eiden M.V. Farrell K. Wilson C.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 626-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor becomes functional when glycosylation is blocked, as can be achieved by treatment with tunicamycin or by mutation. Mutant CHO cell lines defective in various steps in glycosylation are available (23Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 32Stanley P. Somat. Cell Genet. 1983; 9: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The CHO lec2 mutant cell line proved to be highly susceptible to the Moloney murine leukemia viral vector BAG (24Price J. Turner D. Cepko C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) produced in the PA317 packaging cell line (ATCC CRL-9078). We selected spontaneous mutants of CHO lec2 having resistance to thioguanine and to ouabain so that any toxin-resistant mutants obtained could be analyzed by complementation analysis. The resulting universal hybridizer cell line was designated CHO lec2 UH. The introduction of the thioguanine and ouabain resistances did not affect sensitivity to any of the toxins used in this work. Approximately 108 CHO lec2 UH cells were treated with the BAG retroviral vector. After allowing cell growth for expression of mutations, the cells were selected with 10 ng/ml alpha toxin, a dose previously found to kill >99% of the cells. Rare surviving cells were cloned and then compared with the parental line for sensitivity to several toxins. Resistant colonies were obtained at a frequency of approximately 10−7. One group of mutants displayed an intermediate level of resistance, with an EC50 (effective concentration causing 50% death) of about 200 ng/ml, as compared with an EC50 of 5 ng/ml for the CHO lec2 and CHO lec2 UH parents. This group has not been studied further. Another group of mutants, obtained at about the same frequency, was completely resistant to the toxin. A mutant characteristic of this group, designated CHO lec2 UH BAG15, was unaffected by alpha toxin at concentrations of 1 μg/ml (2.2 × 10−8m), the highest concentration tested (Fig. 1, closed symbols). Comparable mutants, ones having intermediate and complete resistance to alpha toxin, were also obtained after chemical mutagenesis with ethylmethane sulfonate (data not shown). These chemically induced mutant cell lines have not been further characterized. Because it is expected that most loss of function mutations would be recessive, these results suggest that the loci being mutated by both the retroviral and chemical methods were already functionally hemizygous (i.e. haploid). CHO cells are unique in that they appear to be functionally hemizygous at many loci (33Adair G.M. Siciliano M.J. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). CHO lec2 UH BAG15 cells could be resistant to alpha toxin because they lack a surface receptor and are unable to bind the toxin. To investigate this possibility, the binding of alpha toxin to the parent and mutant cell lines was measured by FACScan analysis using biotinylated alpha toxin and a phycoerythrin-streptavidin conjugate. The parental cells were highly fluorescent, with a mean relative fluorescence intensity at least 10-fold above that of the mutant cells (Fig. 2 A) and of controls using nonbiotinylated toxin (Fig. 2 B). The low fluorescence of the mutant cells and of the controls is the intrinsic fluorescence of the cells, because it equaled that of cells not incubated with the phycoerythrin reagent (data not shown). The data show that the mutant cells have no detectable ability to bind alpha toxin. As stated earlier, alpha toxin is structurally and functionally related to the Aeromonas channel-forming protein aerolysin, and it is likely the two toxins arose from a common ancestor (12Rossjohn J. Buckley J.T. Hazes B. Murzin A.G. Read R.J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3426-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Ballard J. Crabtree J. Roe B.A. Tweten R.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 340-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seemed probable that the toxins may have similar receptors. Resistance of the CHO lec2 UH BAG15 cells to aerolysin would imply that the two toxins bind to the same receptor. The CHO lec2 and CHO lec2 UH BAG15 cells were tested for sensitivity to aerolysin and alpha toxin in MTT assays (Fig. 1). The parental line, CHO lec2, was sensitive to both toxins, whereas CHO lec2 UH BAG15 was completely resistant to aerolysin at the concentration tested, as it was to alpha toxin. Based on the above results, it seemed likely that the mutant CHO cell line we produced would be deficient in synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins. The first three steps in GPI anchor biosynthesis are as follows.UDP­GlcNAc+PI→(1)GlcNAc­PI→(2)GlcN­PI→(3)GlcN­PI(acyl)Using different assay conditions to optimize each of these reactions (addition of GTP to stimulate the second reaction and GTP + CoA to stimulate the third reaction), we showed that CHO lec2 UH BAG15 cells are deficient in the second enzyme in GPI anchor biosynthesis, N-acetylglucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol deacetylase (PIG-L). Microsomes prepared from parental and mutant cells were assayed for the ability to convert 3H-UDP-GlcNAc to the products of the three steps shown above (Fig.3, lanes 1–6). All three products were synthesized normally by the parental cells (Fig. 3, lanes 1–3). The BAG15 microsomes synthesized GlcNAc-PI, the product of the first reaction, but neither of the later two products (Fig. 3, lanes 4–6), indicating that they were deficient in the second and possibly the third steps in GPI biosynthesis. To measure the second step in isolation, microsomes were incubated with3H-GlcNAc-PI. The parental cells, but not the mutant cells, were able to deacetylate this substrate to produce GlcN-PI (Fig. 3, lanes 7–10). These results show that the BAG15 mutant cells lack PIG-L. This enzyme has been shown to be missing in other CHO mutants defective in GPI biosynthesis (34Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R."

At high magnification, individual ENaC particles exhibited a near-square geometry. Functional studies using wild-type αβ-hENaC coexpressed with γ-hENaC mutants, which rendered the functional channel differentially sensitive to methanethiosulfonate reagents and cadmium, suggested that the functional channel complex contains more than one γ subunit.

Gain-of-function mutations that delete or disrupt a C-terminal motif increase renal Na+ absorption, causing Liddle's syndrome, a genetic form of hypertension. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations cause renal Na+ wasting and hypotension in pseudohypoaldosteronism type I. A large body of functional and biochemical evidence suggests that functional ENaC is composed of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ (6Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C.

However, the subunit stoichiometry of the Na+channel complex is uncertain. Electrophysiological studies have generated two different models of ENaC stoichiometry: one a complex of three α, three β, and three γ subunits (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); and the other a complex containing two α, one β, and one γ (13Firsov D. Gautschi I.

Biochemical studies using sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis also have generated two different models. Two studies found that ENaC subunits assembled into a 25 S complex, suggestive of a high-order oligomer in the range of approximately nine subunits (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Cheng C. Prince L.S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol.

Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To gain new insight into this problem, we used two additional approaches to examine the subunit stoichiometry of ENaC. First, we used freeze-fracture electron microscopy to examine the cross-sectional area of ENaC in the plasma membrane. In freeze-fracture microscopy, the membrane is fractured into two complementary leaflets called the protoplasmic (P) and exoplasmic (E) faces, in which integral membrane proteins appear as intramembrane particles (17Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the dimensions of the freeze-fracture particles of α-helical integral membrane proteins can be used to estimate the number of transmembrane α-helices (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This information, along with secondary structure models, allows us to estimate the oligomeric composition of functional membrane proteins in the plasma membrane. Thus, this approach should enable us to evaluate the oligomeric structure of ENaC and distinguish between the two proposed models. In a second approach we have used a functional assay to determine whether ENaC contains one or more than one γ subunit. α, β, and γ (or γG536C and γS529C) human ENaC in pMT3 were generated as described previously (9McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-L734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J.

Wild-type α, β, γ, or mutant γ ENaC subunits were expressed in albino Xenopus laevis oocytes by nuclear injection of cDNA for each subunit (0.2 ng each). Oocytes were maintained in Barth's medium until used in experiments. After measurement of the whole-cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ current, control oocytes and oocytes expressing wild-type αβγhENaC were fixed and prepared for freeze-fracture microscopy (18Eskandari S.

For particle density determinations, images of P fracture face were digitized at a final magnification of × 150,000. Particle densities were determined by counting P face particles from known areas of the membrane (NIH Image). For the measurement of the dimensions of the freeze-fracture particles, particles were sampled from 15 P fracture face regions from six replicas from six oocytes (two control and four ENaC-expressing oocytes). Particle diameter was measured directly from the negative using a comparator (Nikon, model 6c) at a final magnification of × 1,000,000. The diameter was obtained by measuring the width of the particle edge-to-edge in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the shadow. For the frequency histograms, particle diameter measurements were placed in 0.5 nm bins, and the histograms were plotted at the center of the bin (Fig. 3 A). For the examination of the particle clusters, a cluster was defined as having a particle density >1000/μm2. Particle diameter measurements were plotted as frequency histograms which were fitted to a multiple Gaussian function (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1.fd=∑iAisiexp−0.5d−μisi2Equation 1 where fd is the frequency of occurrence of a particle of size d; d is the measured diameter of a given particle (nm); A is an approximation of the area underneath the curve of a given particle population; μ is the mean diameter of a given population (nm); s is the standard deviation of the population diameter; and i is an integer from 1 to the total number of particle populations. All values are reported as mean ± S.E. cDNAs encoding wild-type α and β hENaC (0.2 ng each) with 0.2 ng of γG536C, γS529C, or a 0.5:0.5 mixture of both (0.1 ng each) were injected as described above. 16–24 h after injection, whole-cell current was measured by two-electrode voltage clamp at −60 mV in a bathing solution of (in mm) 116 NaCl, 2 KCl, 0.4 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. ENaC current (I0) was determined by subtracting the current with a maximal dose of amiloride (100 μm) or benzamil (100 μm) in the bathing solution from base-line current. The magnitude of current inhibited by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET, 1 mm) or cadmium (Cd2+, 10 mm) in the extracellular bathing solution (IInh) was used to determine the fraction of I0 inhibited by these compounds (IInh/I0). We first characterized the density and size of the freeze-fracture particles of the plasma membrane of control oocytes. Consistent with our previous studies, control albino oocytes exhibited a low density of particles in the P fracture face of the plasma membrane at 275 ± 20/μm2 (mean ± S.E.; n = 4644 particles from 15 P face regions covering 16.9 μm2 of plasma membrane) (Fig. 1 A). The E fracture face of albino oocytes contained a population of particles ∼13 nm in diameter at a density of ∼900/μm2(not shown) (19Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All heterologous plasma membrane proteins that we have studied thus far partition to the P face of the plasma membrane (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl.

ENaC also follows this pattern (Fig. 1, B and C; Fig. 2, A–C) and, therefore, our study focused on the P face of the plasma membrane. Analysis of the size (diameter) of the endogenous P face particles of control oocytes (Fig. 2 D) revealed that the particles represented a homogenous population that could be described by a single normal distribution (Fig. 3 A). The mean diameter for this particle population was 6.7 ± 0.3 nm (n = 502).Figure 2High magnification images of ENaC and endogenous particles. A–C, putative ENaC particles;D, endogenous particles. Scale bar, 10 nm (A—D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All ENaC-expressing oocytes used in freeze-fracture studies had amiloride-sensitive whole-cell currents of 5–7 μA (at −50 mV and 100 mm extracellular Na+). The density of plasma membrane particles in ENaC-expressing oocytes was 291 ± 19/μm2 (n = 4556 particles from 27 P face regions covering 17.2 μm2 of plasma membrane), not significantly above background (p > 0.05). However, expression of ENaC resulted in the appearance of clusters of particles in the P face of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, B and C; Fig. 2, A and B), which were not seen in control oocytes. The clusters were seen in ∼65% of the replicas prepared from ENaC-expressing oocytes and occupied ∼0.6% of the plasma membrane surface area (0.39 μm2 in 69.78 μm2 of plasma membrane examined). The average density of particles within the clusters was 2435 ± 575/μm2(range, 1566–9000/μm2). These clusters did not influence the overall density since each cluster occupied a small area (0.020 ± 0.006 μm2; range, 0.001–0.076 μm2) and contained few particles (37 ± 9; range, 5–136). Because of the unique feature of the clusters, we separately characterized the particles within the clusters and those in regions outside of the clusters. The size frequency histogram of the particles within the clusters is shown in Fig. 3 A (n = 789). The fit of the data to a multiple Gaussian distribution indicated that 91% of the particles had a mean diameter of 8.0 ± 0.3 nm. 9% of the particles were larger in size (see Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the size frequency histogram for the particles outside of the clusters exhibited a predominant particle population (6.6 ± 0.3 nm) (n = 521; not shown) which was indistinguishable from the population of endogenous particles in uninjected oocytes (6.7 ± 0.3 nm; see Fig. 3 A). There was also a very small (<4% of total) population of 8.1 ± 0.4 nm particles, similar in size to the particle in the clusters. For proteins with a near-circular (connexin-50 hexamers) or square-shaped (aquaporin-1 tetramers) cross-sectional geometry, the area can be approximated from the diameter of their freeze-fracture particles by assuming a circular cross-sectional shape (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). By using this approach for the particles in the clusters (Fig. 2, A–C), the area calculated from the mean diameter (8.0 ± 0.3 nm) obtained from the frequency histogram was used to predict the number of membrane-spanning α-helices in the integral membrane protein giving rise to these particles (Fig. 3 B) (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To correct for the thickness of the platinum-carbon film, 2.4 ± 0.4 nm was subtracted from the freeze-fracture particle diameter (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The protein cross-sectional diameter (5.6 ± 0.5 nm) was then used to estimate its cross-sectional area (24 ± 3 nm2). Finally, using 1.40 ± 0.03 helix/nm2 (see “Discussion”) (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the area corresponded to that of an integral membrane protein containing 17 ± 2 transmembrane α-helices (Fig. 3 B). Examination of the particles within the clusters at high magnification revealed that they exhibited a near-square geometry characterized by ≈90° angles (a/b ≈1; where a and b are the axes) (Fig. 3 C). We used an electrophysiological assay to determine if ENaC contains more than one γ subunit. Our strategy was to coexpress two mutant γ subunits (γG536C and/or γS529C with wild-type α and β) which leads to the expression of Na+ channels that have different responses to the cysteine-modifying reagents, MTSET and Cd2+. Extracellular MTSET has no significant effect on wild-type ENaC Na+ current (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). When Gly536 in the γ subunit was replaced with cysteine (γ536C), MTSET modification of this cysteine irreversibly decreased the Na+ current by 89% (Fig. 4, A and B) (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This residue is in the second membrane-spanning segment (M2) and lies within the putative channel pore (Fig. 4 C) (23Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, when Ser529which lies just extracellular to M2 (Fig. 4 C) was replaced with cysteine (γ529C), MTSET did not inhibit the channel (Fig. 4, A and B) (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). If ENaC contains only a single γ subunit, then coexpression of a 0.5:0.5 mixture of γ536C and γ529C cDNA (with wild-type α and β) will be expected to produce two populations of channels; half will be expected to contain γ536C and be sensitive to MTSET, and half will be expected to contain γ529C and be insensitive to MTSET. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 C (top panel; α and β subunits are not shown). In this case, we would predict that the response to MTSET would be the average for γ536C and γ529C expressed individually (43% decrease in Na+ current; Fig. 4, B and C). However, when we coexpressed a 0.5:0.5 mixture of γ536Cand γ529C, MTSET decreased the Na+ current by only 21%; significantly less than the proportion of γ536C subunits (p < 0.002; Student's unpaired t test). Thus, there was an apparent functional interaction between the two mutant γ subunits; γ529Csuppressed inhibition of γ536C by MTSET. We also tested the response to Cd2+. This divalent cation also interacts with cysteines, but it is much smaller than MTSET. Cadmium reversibly inhibited αβγ536CENaC but had a minimal effect on αβγ529CENaC (Fig. 4, A and B). However, in contrast to MTSET, Cd2+inhibited the 0.5:0.5 mixture significantly more (61%;p < 0.002) than predicted (42%) for a channel containing only one γ subunit (Fig. 4, A and B). This result also suggests a functional interaction between γ536C and γ529C. A unique feature of ENaC expression in oocytes was that it led to the appearance of clusters of particles in the plasma membrane. Several observations lead to the conclusion that these particles represent ENaC: (i) the clusters only appeared in oocytes expressing ENaC as assessed by the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current and not in control oocytes; (ii) in ENaC-expressing oocytes, the size and shape of the particles in the clusters contrast sharply with those of the endogenous particles of the oocyte plasma membrane, whereas the vast majority (> 96%) of the particles outside of the clusters are indistinguishable from the endogenous ones; (iii) in freeze-fracture studies of control oocytes, and in oocytes overexpressing a variety of other integral membrane proteins, we have not observed such clustering of particles in the plasma membrane; examples include the Na+/glucose cotransporter (21Wright E.M.

Wright, unpublished observations. and facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT1)3; and (iv) the total number of particles in the clusters was consistent with the macroscopic amiloride-sensitive currents measured in the same cells (see below). The combination of freeze-fracture and functional data in the same oocytes provides further evidence that the particles in the clusters are responsible for the macroscopic amiloride-sensitive Na+currents. The fraction of the membrane covered by the ENaC clusters (∼0.006), the average particle density in the clusters (2435/μm2), and the total area of the oocyte plasma membrane obtained from capacitance measurements (∼3 × 107 μm2) (19Zampighi G.A.

This value, together with the macroscopic amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in oocytes used for freeze-fracture studies (I0, ∼6 μA), and the single-channel current (i, ∼0.4 pA) measured under similar conditions (2Snyder P.M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) provide an estimate for the open-state probability of functional ENaC according to Po = I0/Ni. The Po obtained (∼0.04) is in reasonable agreement with that reported previously using a different technique (0.014–0.004) (24Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Mérillat A.-M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). If it is assumed that the 8.1 nm particles outside of the clusters also represent functional ENaC, N would increase to ∼7 × 108 and the Po would be ∼0.02. Therefore, the total number of ENaC particles can reasonably account for the macroscopic amiloride-sensitive currents. An association with cytoskeletal proteins might explain the unique clustering of ENaC. The C terminus of ENaC subunits contains a conserved PPP X Y XX L sequence (2Snyder P.M. Price M.P.

Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) that fits the consensus of a PY (PP X Y) protein-protein interaction motif (25Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The PY motif binds to proteins containing a WW domain, a 35–40-amino acid sequence containing two conserved tryptophan residues (25Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Moreover, Nedd4, a protein containing three WW domains, binds and alters the function of ENaC (26Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 27Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We speculate that binding of endogenous oocyte Nedd4 or a related protein may be responsible for the characteristic clustering of ENaC in the membrane. It is important to note that any putative association of ENaC with factors in the cytoplasm will not alter the freeze-fracture particle diameter measurements as ENaC partitions to the P face of the plasma membrane, and such interactions are not seen in this fracture face. The subunit stoichiometry of ENaC has attracted considerable interest. Although it is well established that all three subunits (α, β, and γ) are required for the assembly of a functional channel with maximal activity, the oligomeric composition has been proposed to be either a complex composed of four subunits, two α, one β, and one γ (13Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Since biochemical and functional studies have led to two different oligomeric structure models (four versus nine subunits), we reasoned that examination of ENaC freeze-fracture particles would provide an independent method to examine its oligomeric assembly. Our freeze-fracture method is based on the finding that the cross-sectional area of the freeze-fracture particles of integral membrane proteins reflects the cross-sectional area of their membrane-spanning region (18Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Kreman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition, for proteins with α-helical transmembrane domains, the cross-sectional area is proportional to the number of helices spanning the plasma membrane. This was based on the comparison of the cross-sectional area of the freeze-fracture particles of aquaporin-1, opsin, and a connexin to their area obtained from projection maps of two-dimensional crystals, and it was established that in cross-section, each helix occupies 1.40 ± 0.03 nm2 (18Eskandari S.

This is an average value and appears to be independent of differences in helical packing and subunit assembly. The secondary structure model for the α, β, or γ subunits of ENaC or subunits belonging to other homologous members of this large family of ion channels predicts two transmembrane helices (M1 and M2) connected through a large extracellular loop, in which both the N and C termini are cytoplasmic (28Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24379-24383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Canessa C.M. Merillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Am. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a heterotetrameric structure of ENaC would be composed of a total of eight transmembrane helices, whereas a structure composed of nine subunits would contain 18 transmembrane helices. By using the relationship described above, the corresponding cross-sectional area for the two proposed ENaC models would be 11.2 and 25.2 nm2. The cross-sectional area of >90% of the particles in the clusters of ENaC-expressing oocytes was 24 ± 3 nm2, corresponding to a complex composed of 17 ± 2 transmembrane α-helices. For ENaC this implies an oligomer of eight or nine subunits, which would predict a molecular mass of ∼700–800 kDa for the channel complex. This observation in the oocyte plasma membrane is consistent with results from sucrose sedimentation data obtained from ENaC expressed in COS-7 cells and in vitro, and with previous functional data (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Cheng C. Prince L.S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22693-22700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the overall shape of individual ENaC particles revealed a near-square geometry with ≈90° angles and a/b ≈1. From structural considerations, such an overall shape constrains the number of subunits forming the channel to four or multiples of four. Therefore, based on the shape and size of the ENaC particles, we are biased toward an oligomeric structure in which the ENaC complex is composed of eight subunits (Fig. 3 C). However, the freeze-fracture data do not allow us to determine the relative stoichiometries of α, β, and γ subunits. Based on the size distribution of the particles in the clusters, no particle population consistent with ENaC heterotetramers (i.e. α2βγ) was detected in the frequency histograms, and only 3% (24 out of 789) of the particles examined had a size that would suggest a complex of four subunits (∼6.1 nm). Nevertheless, the low density of ENaC in the plasma membrane, and the similarity of size of a putative ENaC heterotetramer with that of the endogenous population, prevents us from ruling out the existence of a very small number of ENaC heterotetramers in the plasma membrane. Finally, other particle populations larger in size were also present in the clusters but were considerably lower in abundance (<9% of total). At present we cannot account for these larger particles, but they may represent higher oligomeric states of ENaC. The freeze-fracture data provided evidence for an ENaC complex composed of eight or nine subunits, but it could not be ruled out that a small number of ENaC channels exist in the membrane as heterotetramers (i.e. α2βγ). Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we carried out an assay to determine if the functional form of ENaC contains more than one γ subunit. Our assay was based on the differential sensitivity of two functional Na+ channel mutants to MTSET and Cd2+. The results indicated that both MTSET and Cd2+ significantly inhibited αβγ536CENaC, but neither led to a notable inhibition of αβγ529CENaC. However, when the γ mutants were coexpressed (with wild-type α and β), inhibition by MTSET was less than expected, and inhibition by Cd2+ was more than that expected for a population of channels containing single mutant γ subunits. These data indicate that when γ536C and γ529C were coexpressed, there was an apparent functional interaction between the two mutant γ subunits within the channel complex, such that the sensitivity of the channel to MTSET and Cd2+ no longer resembled that which would be predicted for populations of channels containing only a single mutant γ subunit. Fig. 4 C (bottom panel) shows possible combinations of γ subunits if ENaC contains more than one γ (only two γ subunits are shown). A fraction of channels will contain only γ536C and an equal fraction will contain only γ529C. A larger fraction of channels will contain both γ536C and γ529C, and our results suggest that these channels are insensitive (or less sensitive) to MTSET. Although the mechanism of this protection is not clear, perhaps modification of Cys529 by the large MTSET reagent prevents MTSET from entering the pore, thereby blocking access to Cys536. The conclusion drawn from the functional assay is based on two assumptions: (i) both γ536C and γ529C are expressed equally by the oocytes, and (ii) the mutants assemble randomly into the channel complex. The first assumption seems reasonable since we have previously shown that expression of wild-type γ, γ536C, or γ529C with wild-type α and β leads to quantitatively similar amiloride-sensitive Na+currents (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although we have no direct evidence for the validity of the second assumption, the differential sensitivity of the channel complex to MTSET and Cd2+ when both γ mutants were expressed argues against selective translation and/or association of γ536C or γ529C into the channel complex and further suggests a functional interaction of the subunits when both are present in the Na+ channel complex. Thus, the functional assay of ENaC expressing two different γ mutants argues against functional ENaC heterotetramers (i.e.α2βγ) and predicts the presence of a minimum of two γ subunits in the functional channel complex. Our new observations together with consideration of previous data suggest a way to reconcile the apparently discrepant interpretations of earlier work. Studies using electrophysiologic assays measured current in oocytes expressing combinations of wild-type subunits and subunits bearing point mutations that alter sensitivity to channel blockers, including methanethiosulfonate compounds, amiloride, and Zn2+ (12Snyder P.M.

Such assays require assumptions regarding the dominant effect of the mutation, the relative expression of wild-type and mutant subunits, and random association of subunits into the channel complex. Consequently, these assays tend to provide a minimal estimate of the number of subunits in the channel complex. Thus, data suggesting that ENaC channels are heterotetramers with 2 α, 1 β, and 1 γ subunit (13Firsov D. Gautschi I. Merillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Schild L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.-O.D. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13469-13474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) may be explained if the channel is in fact a multiple of a tetramer containing 8 subunits, perhaps with a stoichiometry of 4 α, 2 β, and 2 γ subunits. Our functional data suggest that the channel complex contains more than one γ subunit. Thus, a channel composed of eight subunits would not simply be a combination of two tetrameric channels but rather both γ subunits would contribute to a common pore. Moreover, sucrose gradient centrifugation provided differing results depending on the detergent used. When ENaC was solubilized in CHAPS or Triton X-100, migration was consistent with a tetrameric size (15Cheng C. Prince L.S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22693-22700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but when it was solubilized in digitonin, the data suggested a higher-order complex consistent with eight or nine subunits (12Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Cheng C. Prince L.S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22693-22700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because results obtained from this technique depend on the ability of the channel complex to remain intact in the presence of detergent, such studies may also underestimate the number of subunits. The freeze-fracture technique used here provides an independent estimate of eight or nine subunits by directly examining the area of the channel complex in the natural lipid environment of the oocyte plasma membrane. Although our present data leave open the question of the relative stoichiometry of the channel complex, they do provide important new insights into the total number of subunits in the complex, which may help reconcile earlier reports, and they influence future models of the channel and its investigation. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, ENaC appeared in the plasma membrane in clusters of particles, and the total of number of ENaC particles in these clusters was consistent with amiloride-sensitive macroscopic currents in the same cells. The cross-sectional area of ENaC in the plasma membrane obtained from the dimensions of the particles suggested that the functional ENaC complex contains eight or nine subunits. However, the overall shape of ENaC particles (near-square) leads us to hypothesize that ENaC is composed of eight subunits. Furthermore, our functional data suggested that each functional ENaC contains a minimum of two γ subunits. The functional and biochemical similarity of ENaC to other members of the DEG/ENaC family of channels suggests that our findings may represent a common structural and functional feature of this class of membrane proteins."

Greenberg D.M. Metabolic Pathways. 3rd Ed. 7. Academic Press, New York1975: 1-25Google Scholar). CoA also donates the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl cofactor to the acyl carrier protein of the fatty acid synthase complex (2Vagelos P.R. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 155-159Google Scholar). The synthesis of CoA occurs in five steps which, utilize pantothenate (vitamin B5), cysteine, and ATP (for review, see Ref. 3Robishaw J.D. Neely J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E1-E9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all systems studied, the rate of CoA biosynthesis appears to be regulated by feedback inhibition of the first enzyme of the pathway, pantothenate kinase (4Halvorsen O. Skrede S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Fisher M.N. Neely J.R. FEBS Lett. 1985; 190: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 6Vallari D.S. Jackowski S.

Biophys. 1993; 301: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of pantothenate kinase from Escherichia coli showed that (a) CoA and, to a lesser extent, its acyl thioesters are competitive inhibitors with respect to ATP and (b) the Ki values are within the physiological range of intracellular CoA concentrations (6Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2468-2471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the intermediates in CoA biosynthesis have shown that both pantothenate and 4′-phosphopantetheine can accumulate in the cell (8Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, in addition to control of CoA synthesis on the level of pantothenate kinase, further modulation of flux through the pathway could occur at phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT), which catalyzes the penultimate step in the pathway (Fig.1), the reversible adenylation of 4′-phosphopantetheine to form 3′-dephospho-CoA (dPCoA) and pyrophosphate (PPi). Regulation at this step may control the reutilization of 4′-phosphopantetheine arising either from the turnover of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl cofactor of the acyl carrier protein (8Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 115-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the cleavage of CoA by a phosphodiesterase (9Vallari D.S. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3961-3966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the above arguments for a role in the regulation of CoA biosynthesis, PPAT has not been the subject of a detailed study. Enzymes with PPAT activity have been purified from a number of different organisms. In mammals PPAT has been shown to be part of a complex that also includes dPCoA kinase, the effector of the final step in the biosynthetic pathway, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribose ring of dPCoA. The bi-functional complex (“CoA synthase”) was purified from pig liver (10Worrall D.M. Tubbs P.K. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and shown to exist in solution as a homodimer with subunits of 57 kDa. Limited proteolysis of the latter revealed that the subunits are identical and that each subunit contains both PPAT and dPCoA kinase (11Worrall D.M. Lambert S.F. Tubbs P.K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although similar bi-functional complexes have been partially purified from other mammalian sources (12Stewart C.J. Ball Jr., W.J. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3883-3886Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki T. Abiko Y. Shimizu M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1967; 62: 642-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the PPAT of bakers' yeast (14Bucovaz E.T. Macleod R.M. Morrison J.C. Whybrew W.D. Biochimie. 1997; 79: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was identified as part of a much larger (375–400 kDa) CoA-synthesizing protein complex, which contained six different enzyme activities involved in the synthesis and metabolism of CoA. The complex could be separated into two components, the smallest of which (10–15 kDa) contained both PPAT and dPCoA kinase activities. Prior to the present study, the only bacterial PPAT studied in detail is that from Brevibacterium ammoniagenes (15Martin D.P. Drueckhammer D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which, in contrast to the mammalian and yeast enzymes, is not part of a (multi)enzyme complex and behaves as a trimeric protein of 108 kDa with subunits of 35.4 kDa. Thus far none of the above proteins shown to possess PPAT activity has been extensively characterized. Here we report the purification of the wild-type enzyme from E. coli, and the identification of its gene sequence, previously attributed to kdtB and now designated coaD. The overexpression of coaD yielded sufficient protein for a characterization of PPAT, which included kinetic studies and determination of the molecular mass (and subunit structure) of the protein. PPAT appears to catalyze the reverse reaction (the formation of 4′-phosphopantetheine and ATP) by a sequential (ternary complex) mechanism, in which the order of addition of substrates is not yet known. Hydrodynamic and cross-linking studies suggest that PPAT is hexameric, behaving as a dimer of trimers. dPCoA, d-pantethine, PPi, PPi reagent, and DEAE-Sephacel were purchased from Sigma. Dilithium CoA, Sephadex G-25, Sepharose 4B, and the following chromatography columns: PD-10, Resource Q (1 ml), HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 High Resolution (2.6 × 60 cm), and HiLoad Q-Sepharose (2.6 × 10 cm), were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Trisodium ATP, disodium CTP, disodium NADP, disodium NADH, monosodium phosphoenolpyruvate, recombinant hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from yeast, as well as pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle, were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 3-Deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals. d-Pantetheine was prepared by reduction of d-pantethine using a 4-fold excess of dithiothreitol (DTT). Procion Red H-E3B was obtained from BDH and linked to Sepharose 4B. The resulting resin (Red-Sepharose) contained 631 nmol of bound dye/g of moist gel (16Lowe C.R. Pearson J.C.

E. coli JM101 was grown in 0.5-liter cultures of 2× YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl per liter) in 2-liter flasks at 37 °C and 250 rpm. Cells were harvested in the late exponential growth phase (after 8–9 h) and stored at −20 °C before use. PPAT activity was assayed in the reverse direction using hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase to couple ATP production to NADP reduction (17Lamprecht W. Trautschold I. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 2101-2110Google Scholar). The 1-ml assay mixture consisted of 0.1 mm dPCoA, 2 mmPPi, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNADP+, 5 mm glucose, 4 units of hexokinase, and 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm DTT (2× TD buffer). Steady state kinetic measurements were carried out with 40 nm PPAT in the assay mixture. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the obtained experimental data simultaneously to the equation for a sequential reaction mechanism using Igor for Apple Macintosh (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). dPCoA kinase assays followed the production of ADP from dPCoA and ATP using pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as coupling enzymes to monitor NADH oxidation (18Jaworek A Gruber W. Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 2127-2131Crossref Google Scholar). The 1-ml assay mixture consisted of 0.1 mm dPCoA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.16 mm NADH, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, and 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase in 2× TD buffer. Nucleotidyltransferase activity was assayed by monitoring the production of PPi by the method of O'Brien (19O'Brien W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 76: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using a commercially available coupled enzyme system (PPi reagent). The 1-ml assay mixture contained 1 or 5 mm3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid, 2 mm CTP or ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 250 μl of PPi reagent in 2× TD buffer. All enzyme assays were carried out at 25 °C, and the change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. One unit of activity corresponds to the formation of 1 μmol of product/min using an extinction coefficient for NAD(P)H of 6,220 m−1cm−1. Rates were corrected for nonspecific oxidation of NADH or reduction of NADP. CoA or dPCoA (1 mm) was mixed with 20 mm PPi and 10 μm PPAT in 2× TD buffer. Each reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min or 48 h (30 min for dPCoA) at room temperature, diluted with water to 20 ml and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.0 × 9.5 cm), equilibrated with 20 ml of 0.3m HCl, 30 ml of water, and 10 ml of water containing 0.5 mm DTT, respectively. The column was washed with water and the bound compounds were eluted with a gradient from 0 to 0.2m NaCl (60 ml) and from 0.2 to 0.6 m NaCl (30 ml) at 0.5 ml/min. The amounts of substrates remaining and products formed were determined as follows. PPi was determined by the method of O'Brien (19O'Brien W.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 76: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using PPi reagent. 4′-Phosphopantetheine was determined by monitoring the production of PPi in the forward reaction of PPAT by the method described above. The 1-ml assay mixture consisted of a 4′-phosphopantetheine-containing sample, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 40 nm PPAT, and 250 μl of PPi reagent in 2× TD buffer. ATP was determined by the method of Lamprecht and Trautschold (17Lamprecht W. Trautschold I. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. 4. Academic Press, New York1974: 2101-2110Google Scholar). CoA was determined by a method adapted from Barnes and Weitzman (20Barnes S.J. Weitzman P.D.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were carried out by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. In the last steps of the purification of wild-type PPAT, the amount of protein was estimated from the chromatography profiles using a specific absorption coefficient at 280 nm (A280 nm0.1%) of 0.523 (this paper). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C except for the FPLC steps, which were carried out at room temperature. Wet cell paste (69.5 g) of E. coli JM101 was resuspended in 70 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm DTT, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg of DNase. Cells cooled on ice were disrupted by sonication (10 bursts of 60 s). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (30,000 × g for 20 min). The supernatant was divided into two equal fractions, which were separately applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.2 × 20.5 cm), equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm DTT (TD buffer). The column was washed with TD buffer, and the proteins were eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in TD buffer at 1 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 25 ml by ultrafiltration (10-kDa cut-off membrane). The concentrate was dialyzed overnight against 1.5 liters of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm DTT (HMD buffer) and applied to a Red-Sepharose column (1.6 × 20 cm), equilibrated with HMD buffer. Proteins were allowed to bind to the resin for 10 min before the column was washed with HMD buffer at 1 ml/min. Most of the PPAT activity did not bind to the resin. The active fractions of both runs were pooled and concentrated to 26.5 ml and applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (2.6 × 32 cm), equilibrated with HMD buffer. Proteins were eluted with HMD buffer at 2 ml/min. The fractions containing the bulk of the proteins were separated from fractions containing material with a lower molecular weight (monitored by the absorbance at 280 nm), and then pooled and concentrated to 25 ml. This step was repeated, and the eluate was concentrated to 24.1 ml and reapplied to a fresh Red-Sepharose column, equilibrated with HMD buffer. Most of the PPAT activity now bound to the resin, and proteins were eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 mNaCl in HMD buffer at 1 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 12.5 ml, and dialyzed overnight against 1.5 liters of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm DTT (HD buffer). The dialysate was applied to a Resource Q FPLC column (1 ml), equilibrated with HD buffer. The column was washed with HD buffer and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.4 m NaCl in HD buffer. Active fractions were pooled (2 ml), desalted by passage through a PD-10 gel filtration column, and reapplied to the Resource Q column. PPAT was eluted using the same gradient. The active fractions were pooled (2.4 ml) and applied to a HiPrep Sephacryl S-100 High Resolution FPLC column (2.6 × 60 cm), equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.5 mm DTT (HSD buffer). Proteins were eluted with HSD buffer at 1 ml/min. The active fractions were combined, concentrated to 0.5 ml, and stored at −80 °C. The Sephacryl S-100 column was calibrated using ovotransferrin (77.0 kDa), ovalbumin (42.7 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30.0 kDa), myoglobin (17.2 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.3 kDa) as molecular size standards. The coaD gene was amplified using E. coli JM101 genomic DNA as a template in the polymerase chain reaction. The forward primer incorporated a Xba I restriction site and a ribosome binding site in front of the start codon: 5′-GCTCTAGAGCTATGAAGGAGATATACATATGCAAAAACGGGCGAT-3′. The reverse primer incorporated a Bam HI restriction site preceding the stop codon: 5′-CGGGATCCAACGCTACGCTAACTTC-3′. The amplification cycle was as follows: denaturation at 92 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. Amplification was performed for 25 cycles, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into Xba I/Bam HI cleaved pUC19. The resulting plasmid was designated pUC/coaD. E. coli JM101 was transformed with pUC/coaD to yield an overexpressing strain. All steps were carried out using standard molecular biology procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli JM101-pUC/coaD was cultured on 2× YT medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and harvested in the stationary growth phase (after 16–24 h). Cells (35.3 g) were disrupted to give a cell-free extract, and ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel was performed as described above. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 30 ml, and dialyzed overnight against 1.5 liters of HMD buffer. The dialysate was applied to a Red-Sepharose column, but most of the PPAT activity did not bind to the resin and was collected in the flow-through. This was directly applied to a HiLoad Q Sepharose FPLC column (2.6 × 10 cm), equilibrated with HD buffer. The column was washed with HD buffer and proteins eluted with a 250-ml linear gradient from 0.25 to 0.45 m NaCl in HD buffer at 5 ml/min. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 8.1 ml, and applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column. Proteins were eluted with HSD buffer at 1 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated to 13 ml (about 20 mg/ml), and stored at −80 °C. 4 ml (about 80 mg) of purified recombinant PPAT was diluted to 7.5 ml with 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.5 mmDTT (CD buffer) and dialyzed overnight against 800 ml of CD buffer. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 ×g for 5 min and the supernatant applied to a Sephacryl S-100 column, equilibrated with CD buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (CSD buffer). PPAT was eluted with CSD buffer at 1 ml/min. Fractions with a A280/A266 ratio higher than 1.0 were pooled, concentrated to 7.0 ml, and reapplied to the Sephacryl S-100 column. Fractions with a A280/A266 ratio equal or higher than 1.24 were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 1.5 liters of HD buffer, concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. SDS-PAGE was carried out in 15% polyacrylamide gels using the Tris-glycine buffer system of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out with 7 μg purified wild-type PPAT, and the protein was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride as described by Towbin et al. (24Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The transfer buffer used contained 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 10% methanol, and 0.03% SDS. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in 50% methanol and submitted for commercial N-terminal sequencing. The subcloned coaD gene was sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The double-stranded DNA template was denatured and annealed to the forward and reverse M13 primers as described by Martsen et al. (25Martsen E.O. Zeng M. Lapeyre J.-N. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Cross-linking experiments were carried out following the procedure of Seizen et al. (26Seizen R.J. Bindels J.G. Hoenders H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). PPAT was exchanged into 0.2 m triethanolamine buffer, pH 8.0, using a PD-10 gel filtration column. Glutaraldehyde was dissolved in this buffer and mixed immediately with protein at a final concentration of 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 mg/ml. The final protein concentration in the reaction mixtures was 1 mg/ml. Cross-linking reactions were incubated for between 5 and 120 min at room temperature, and reactions were stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 50 mm. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In order to purify PPAT from E. coli, the procedure published for the B. ammoniagenes enzyme (15Martin D.P. Drueckhammer D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was followed initially. This comprises cell breakage by sonication, followed by ion-exchange chromatography (PPAT eluting at approximately 0.34 m NaCl). The next step in the protocol for PPAT involves elution by a salt gradient from a Red-Sepharose column. However, PPAT failed to bind to this resin unless it had first been subjected to gel filtration to remove low molecular weight (less than 1000) compounds. Nevertheless, both Red-Sepharose steps (before and after gel filtration) remained part of the procedure since the combination of these three steps improved the purification greatly (Table I). The last step in the published procedure involves affinity chromatography on Red-Sepharose. However, PPAT failed to elute from the column in buffers containing up to 0.5 mm dPCoA. Finally, PPAT was purified to homogeneity using high resolution anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (TableI).Table IPurification of PPAT from E. coli JM101Purification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldCell-free extract7134(4.38)0.00061(100)1DEAE-Sephacel5794.380.007610013Red-Sepharose I1603.980.0259141Sephadex G-251493.590.0248239Red-Sepharose II1.881.720.92391500Resource Q0.06941-aThe amount of protein was estimated using a molecular extinction coefficient for PPAT at 280 nm of 9330m−1 cm−1 (this paper).1.4120.33233,300Sephacryl S-1000.02051-aThe amount of protein was estimated using a molecular extinction coefficient for PPAT at 280 nm of 9330m−1 cm−1 (this paper).0.45722.31036,600The data were obtained with 69.5 g of wet cell paste.

The purity of PPAT during the purification procedure as analyzed by SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 2. The purified enzyme showed one band of molecular mass of 18.4 ± 0.3 kDa. The purified PPAT did not show any activity in the assay for dPCoA kinase. 7 μg of the purified enzyme was electroblotted and analyzed by N-terminal sequencing.

The kdtB gene from the E. coli genome was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the resulting product was inserted into pUC19. E. coli JM101 transformed with the kdtB containing plasmid overexpressed PPAT, but addition of 1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture medium did not increase the level of overexpression. Analysis of the cell-free extract showed that the protein was soluble and had a greatly increased specific activity for PPAT (from 0.00061 to 1.0 units/mg). The DNA sequence of the cloned gene was determined and was identical to the published sequence (28Clementz T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9687-9696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the kdtB gene was renamed coaD. For the purification of the recombinant PPAT from E. coli JM101-pUC/coaD, the same approach was followed as described above (Table II). After the initial anion exchange chromatography step, the fractions containing PPAT activity were applied to Red-Sepharose. Almost all of the activity did not bind to the resin, but, unlike the wild-type enzyme, the bound compound(s) could not be removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (see below). The enzyme was further purified close to homogeneity using high resolution anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (Fig.4). The final preparation was very stable on storage and on freezing and thawing; no loss in activity was found when the protein was stored at −80 °C for a period of 5 months. After storage for more than 6 months at −20 °C, 89% of the original activity remained.Table IIPurification of recombinant PPAT from E. coli JM101-pUC/coaDPurification stepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldCell-free extract328733071.01001.0DEAE-Sephacel99933663.41023.4Red-Sepharose52424884.8754.8HiLoad Q35725027.0767.0Sephacryl S-10024822499.1689.1The data were obtained with 35.3 g of wet cell paste.

First, LHCP interacts with a chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) to form a soluble targeting intermediate called the transit complex. Second, LHCP integrates into the thylakoid membrane in the presence of GTP, at least one other soluble factor, and undefined membrane components. We previously determined that cpSRP is composed of 43- and 54-kDa polypeptides. We have examined the subunit stoichiometry of cpSRP and find that it is trimeric and composed of two subunits of cpSRP43/subunit of cpSRP54. A chloroplast homologue of FtsY, an Escherichia coli protein that is critical for the function of E. coli SRP, was found largely in the stroma unassociated with cpSRP. When chloroplast FtsY was combined with cpSRP and GTP, the three factors promoted efficient LHCP integration into thylakoid membranes in the absence of stroma, demonstrating that they are all required for reconstituting the soluble phase of LHCP transport.

A key feature of the SRP/SRP receptor interaction is the ability of the SRP receptor α-subunit and SRP54 to reciprocally stimulate their GTP hydrolysis activities upon mutual binding in the presence of SRP RNA and thereby to regulate the GTP hydrolysis cycle associated with SRP-dependent protein targeting (10Miller J.D.

The known substrates of cpSRP are the LHCPs, hydrophobic proteins that are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are post-translationally transported to the internal membranes of the chloroplast via the soluble phase (18Cline K.

The solubility of LHCP is maintained in the stroma by its binding to cpSRP to form the targeting intermediate termed the transit complex (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I.

However, one unresolved issue is the subunit stoichiometry of cpSRP and the transit complex. The molecular weight estimate of the transit complex from nondenaturing gel analysis is 120,000 (20Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas the molecular weight of cpSRP from gel filtration is 200,000 (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F.

Also unresolved is the fact that the soluble form of LHCP is incapable of inserting into the thylakoid membrane unless additional stroma is added (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The requirement for additional stroma has fueled the speculation that two stromal factors are involved in LHCP integration: one factor, cpSRP, binds LHCP to form the intermediate, and the second facilitates membrane insertion (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This idea is directly supported by the observation that LHCP integration does not occur when the stroma is immunodepleted of cpSRP, but does occur when the immunodepleted stroma is supplemented with cpSRP (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, it is likely that the second chloroplast protein participates in the regulation of the GTPase activity of cpSRP54; and hence, a likely candidate would be a homologue of the SRP receptor.

Genet. 1987; 210: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), is homologous to the soluble α-subunit of the SRP receptor (23Bernstein H. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P. Brenner S. Walter P. Nature. 1989; 340: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Recently, a putative ftsY gene was detected on chromosome II of Arabidopsis (Bacterial Artificial Clone number F4I18.25 and GenBankTM accession number ATAC004665). In the present work, we demonstrate that the FtsY homologue is a chloroplast protein and, together with cpSRP and GTP, is required for reconstituting the soluble phase of LHCP transport. Furthermore, using these functionally active proteins, we have measured the subunit stoichiometry of cpSRP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA constructsGST43 Translation Vector (pSPUTKGSTchaos)The chaos cDNA encoding cpSRP43 was subcloned into the E. coli expression vector pGTK+ (generously provided by John Walker) by PCR amplification of the plasmid pBSSK+sschaos with the primers GGAATTCGCCGCCGTACAAAGAAAC, which introduces an Eco RI site just 5′ to the processing site, and GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC (T7 primer), which results in the introduction of a 3′-Xho I site from the polylinker. The resulting PCR product was digested with Eco RI and Xho I and subcloned into the same sites of pGTK+ to form plasmid pGTK+chaos. This plasmid encodes a GST43 fusion protein. To make the translation construct of GST43, the insert from pGTK+chaos was subcloned in two steps. First, pGTK+chaos was PCR-amplified with AGTATCCATGGCCCCTATACTAGG, which introduces an Nco I site at the initiation codon of GST, and CGGGGTACCTCATTCATTCATTGGTTGTTG, a reverse primer that hybridizes to the 3′-end of the chaos cDNA. The PCR product was digested with Nco I and Bam HI, and the 670-base pair fragment encoding GST was subcloned into the Nco I and Bam HI sites of pSPUTK to form pTU3. The remaining portion of the insert from pGTK+chaos was subcloned as a Bam HI-Cla I fragment into similarly digested pTU3 to form pSPUTKGSTchaos.GST54his Expression Vector (pGTK+ 54his)pNH4 (24Pilgrim M.L. van Wijk K.-J. Parry D.H. Sy D.A.C. Hoffman N.E. Plant J. 1998; 13: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was digested with Hin dIII and partially digested with Eco RI. The 1500-base pair fragment was subcloned into the same sites in pGTK+ to form pGTK+54his.GST54his Translation Vector (pSPUTK54+his)pGTK+54his was digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII and cloned into the 3.6-kilobase vector fragment from pSPUTKGSTchaos digested with Bam HI and partially digested with Hin dIII to form pSPUTK+54his.ftsY RNA was extracted (RNeasy kit, QIAGEN Inc.) from Arabidopsis leaf tissue and used to amplify the ftsY cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. To clone the FtsY precursor into a translation vector, the forward and reverse primers CTCTAGCACAACTGCCATGGCAACTTCT and GGTTCTAAAGCTTAAGAGAATATAGCATTCAC, respectively, were used to introduce Nco I and Hin dIII sites at the initiation methionine and stop codons of the open reading frame, and the resulting PCR product was cloned into the same sites of pSS6.5NcoI (14Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to form pTU1. For overexpressing FtsY in E. coli, the forward primer GGGGATCCGCCGGACCGAGCGGATTCTTC, which introduces a Bam HI site at the predicted processing site, and the above reverse primer were used to PCR amplify cDNA that was cloned into the Bam HI and Hin dIII sites of pQE30 to form pTU2. The GST43 expression vector (pGEX4Tchaos(m)), the cpSRP54 translation vector (pAF1), and the Lhcb1 translation vector (pAB80) have been previously described (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S.

Cells were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin to an absorbance of 0.6–1.0, and expression was induced by the addition of 0. 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested and frozen at −80 °C until use. Overexpressed protein was purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) as suggested by the manufacturer. Recombinant protein was further purified by SDS-PAGE, eluted from gel slices, and injected into rabbits to raise antibodies (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). The IgG fraction was prepared from crude serum and affinity-purified on antigen cross-linked to Affi-Gel 10 (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

The cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of 1.5 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by immunoblotting as described (24Pilgrim M.L. van Wijk K.-J. Parry D.H. Sy D.A.C. Hoffman N.E. Plant J. 1998; 13: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Subunit StoichiometrycpSRP was assembled by incubating 3.4 μCi of cpSRP54his and 2.7 μCi of GST43 translation products with incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 50 mm KOAc, and 10 mm MgCl2) for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was mixed end-over-end with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1.5 ml of washing buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 0.3 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1% Tween 20). The beads were transferred to Wizard minicolumns (Promega), and the protein was eluted in 50 μl of 10 mm glutathione in incubation buffer. The eluted sample was diluted to 120 μl with incubation buffer and incubated with Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were transferred to a second Wizard column, washed three times with 1.5 ml of washing buffer, and eluted in 45 μl of 200 mm imidazole in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0. The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 13% acrylamide gels, and radioactivity was quantitated by radioimaging on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Normalized pixel values were calculated by dividing the total pixels in each band by the number of methionines within the protein, and the ratio of the normalized values was used to calculate the molar ratio of the two subunits. To investigate cpSRP43-mediated dimerization of cpSRP54, 0.5 μg of GST54 was incubated with 3.4 μCi of cpSRP54his, 0.5 μg of cpSRP43, or both under standard conditions; purified on glutathione-Sepharose; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above.Isolation of Stroma, Salt Washing of Thylakoids, and Gel FiltrationThe stroma was collected from chloroplasts lysed in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer) at 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml and centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The thylakoid pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer containing the indicated salt solution. Samples were rotated end-over-end for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged, and the pellet was washed a second time as described before and resuspended in lysis buffer at a concentration of 0.5 mg of chlorophyll/ml.Arabidopsis stroma, pea stroma, or purified recombinant protein was fractionated on a Superose 6HR gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 180 mm NaCl at 0.5 ml/min and analyzed as described (12Schuenemann D.

Thylakoids containing 25 μg of chlorophyll were resuspended in a total of 100 μl of the indicated reaction mixture. Each reaction mixture contained 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm methionine, 0.15 mm GTP, 82 mmsorbitol, and 13 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0. cpSRP54, cpFtsY, and LHCP were translated either in a wheat germ translation extract or a commercial rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The amounts added for wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysate translations were as follows: cpSRP54, 20 and 20 μl, respectively; cpFtsY, 40 and 30 μl, respectively; and LHCP, 5 and 40 μl, respectively. Recombinant cpSRP43 (150 ng), pea stroma (equivalent to 90 μg of chlorophyll), and apyrase (1 unit) were added as noted. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by trypsin treatment and analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography.GeneralPreviously described conditions were used for import of FtsY into chloroplasts (26Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in vitro transcription/translation (26Adam Z. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1993; 102: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and expression and purification of GST fusion proteins (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Mature cpSRP43 was generated by thrombin cleavage of GST43 using biotinylated thrombin and purified from GST and thrombin using streptavidin-agarose (Novagen) as suggested by the manufacturer.DISCUSSIONThis work establishes four new and important points. First, we show that cpSRP43 is a dimer. Second, we demonstrate that cpSRP is a trimer consisting of two cpSRP43 subunits and one cpSRP54 subunit (Fig.6). Third, we show that cpFtsY is a soluble chloroplast protein that has a weak affinity for cpSRP. Fourth, we conclusively demonstrate that cpFtsY is the second soluble factor that is required to reconstitute the soluble phase of LHCP transport.cpSRP is distinctive in its ability to interact with members of the LHCP protein family post-translationally. It is likely that this specialized role is mediated directly or indirectly through cpSRP43. From an analysis of Arabidopsis mutants that lack cpSRP43, it appears that only members of the LHCP protein family are adversely affected (15Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D.G. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Amin P. Sy D. Pilgrim M. Parry D. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; (Bethesda), in pressPubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that cpSRP43 functions primarily, if not exclusively, in LHCP biogenesis. Mutant plants lacking cpSRP54 show wider effects; chloroplast encoded proteins whose targeting is cotranslational are affected in addition to LHCP (17Amin P. Sy D. Pilgrim M. Parry D. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; (Bethesda), in pressPubMed Google Scholar, 24Pilgrim M.L. van Wijk K.-J. Parry D.H. Sy D.A.C. Hoffman N.E. Plant J. 1998; 13: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A substantial pool of cpSRP54 is dissociated from cpSRP43 and associated with 70 S ribosomes (14Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cpSRP54 has been shown to directly interact with the nascent chain of a chloroplast protein synthesized in a chloroplast translation extract (30Nilsson R. Brunner J. Hoffman N.E. van Wijk K.-J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 733-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, we think it likely that cpSRP54 free of cpSRP43 mediates cotranslational targeting, whereas the presence of cpSRP43 enables the post-translational interaction between cpSRP and LHCP. Cross-linking data clearly demonstrate that cpSRP54 directly interacts with LHCP (16Li X.X. Henry R. Yuan J.G. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It remains to be shown whether cpSRP43 is also able to interact directly with LHCP or whether it simply modifies the conformation of cpSRP54 to facilitate the post-translational interaction. Previously, we entertained the possibility that cpSRP43 effectively dimerized cpSRP54 and thereby created a novel interaction between the SRP54 homologue and its substrate (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The results from the present study clearly indicate that cpSRP, like cytoplasmic SRP, contains a single SRP54 subunit that presumably binds a single substrate molecule. Thus, the predicted molecular mass of cpSRP is 123 kDa. The large deviation of the mass estimate by gel filtration from the predicted value suggests that cpSRP is not a globular protein.Previous work provided strong evidence that LHCP integration required multiple soluble factors (12Schuenemann D. Gupta S. Persello-Cartieaux F. Klimyuk V.I. Jones J.D.G. Nussaume L. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10312-10316Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), a hypothesis that has now been validated. The present data also provide strong evidence that cpSRP, cpFtsY, and GTP are sufficient for reconstituting the soluble phase of LHCP transport. Purifying an active form of cpSRP54 is an obstacle that must be overcome to prove this point conclusively. For reconstitution experiments, recombinant and highly purified cpSRP43 was used, whereas cpSRP54, cpFtsY, and LHCP were synthesized by translation in either wheat germ extracts or rabbit reticulocyte lysates (data not shown). The fact that LHCP integration can be reconstituted using translation products synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates indicates that no other chloroplast factors are required for the reaction.In E. coli, SRP-dependent proteins are inserted into the membrane via the Sec translocon (31Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. deGier J.W.L. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12177-12182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One unresolved question is whether the Sec translocon is required for LHCP integration. The results presented here are inconsistent with the involvement of cpSecA in LHCP integration. cpSecA is a soluble protein that needs to be added as stroma or purified protein to reconstitute efficient translocation of OE33 across the thylakoid membranes (34Yuan J.G. Henry R. Mccaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Hulford A. Hazell L. Mould R.M. Robinson C. J. Biol.

In the present work, efficient integration of LHCP occurred without specifically adding cpSecA. Together with the observations that azide (an inhibitor of cpSecA) does not inhibit LHCP integration (34Yuan J.G. Henry R. Mccaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), that OE33 is not a competitor of LHCP integration (40Cline K. Henry R. Li C.J. Yuang J.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and that maize SecA mutants have normal levels of LHCP (41Voelker R. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the data imply either that the cpSRP and cpSec pathways do not converge at the Sec translocon or, alternatively, that cpSecY/E is active in the absence of cpSecA. Either case represents a fundamental departure from translocation events in E. coli.We have now shown that cpFtsY is required for the activity of the specialized cpSRP. It remains to be determined whether cpFtsY also functions with cpSRP54 in the biogenesis of chloroplast encoded proteins. In either case, FtsY may regulate the GTPase activity of cpSRP54 and play a role in piloting SRP-dependent substrates to the thylakoid membrane. The fact that LHCP transport can now be reconstituted from defined components will allow detailed mechanistic studies to be conducted on this pathway. SRP1 mediates the cotranslational targeting of endomembrane and secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes and of polytopic membrane proteins to the cytoplasmic membrane in prokaryotes (1Rapoport T.A.

N-methyl-d-aspartate NMDA R1 NMDA R2 human embryonic kidney The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)1 subtype of the excitatory glutamate receptor is a hetero-oligomeric protein composed of the two classes of NMDA receptor subunits, namely, NR1 and NR2. The NR1 subunit is encoded by a single gene, which undergoes extensive alternative splicing to generate eight different splice forms. The NR2 subunit class consists of four genes encoding the subunits NR2A–NR2D. The subunits are thought to co-assemble in different combinations to form functionally distinct NMDA receptors (1Sucher N.J. Awobuluyi M. Choi Y. Lipton S.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 348-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Biochemical and functional studies reported to date are ambiguous with regard to both NMDA receptor subunit stoichiometry and quaternary structure. Functional studies indicate that the binding of at least two molecules of both glutamate and glycine is required for NMDA receptor activation (2Patneau D.K. Mayer M.L. J.

The molecular size of native NMDA receptors, as determined by both gel filtration and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is in the range of 605–850 kDa (8Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E.

The determination of the subunit copy number has also been addressed by the coexpression of wild-type and mutant forms of either the NR1 or NR2 subunit. These results have been inconclusive, with reports of two or three NR1 subunits and two or three NR2 subunits/functional NMDA receptor complex (15Béhé P. Stern P. Wyllie D.J.A. Nassar M. Schoepfer R. Colquhoun D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1995; 262: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Premkumar L.S. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with the NR1-1a and NR2A NMDA receptor subunits in combination with both FLAG- and c-Myc epitope-tagged forms of the NR2B subunit. The expressed receptors were purified by anti-NR2A and anti-FLAG antibody immunoaffinity chromatography in series. Immunoblots of the double immunoaffinity-purified material demonstrated the presence of anti-c-Myc antibody immunoreactivity. This is presented as evidence for the co-association of three NR2 subunits, i.e. NR2A/NR2BFLAG/NR2Bc-Myc, within the same NMDA receptor complex. Additionally, the NR1/NR2 subunit ratio in both native and cloned NMDA receptors was determined, which further substantiated a 2:3 NR1/NR2 subunit ratio/receptor. The mouse NR2B subunit was epitope-tagged with either the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) or the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (SculptorTM in vitro mutagenesis system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All tags were positioned between amino acids 53 and 54 of the NR2B subunit using the following oligonucleotides: FLAG, GTCATCTTTCTCGTGCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGCATCTTTTATGGC; and c-Myc, GTCATCTTTCTCGTGTAGGTCTTCTTCTGATATTAGCTTTTGTTCGGCATCTTTTATGGC. The position of the tag was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNAs encoding the FLAG- and c-Myc-tagged NR2B subunits were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIS for transfection into HEK 293 cells. The peptide corresponding to amino acids 1381–1394 (RCPSDPYKHSLPSQ) of the mouse NR2A subunit with an N-terminal K was conjugated to thyroglobulin by the glutaraldehyde method. The resultant conjugate was used to generate polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Antibody production and affinity purification were carried out as described previously (18Chazot P.L. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1176-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunoblots probed with affinity-purified anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) antibodies detected a single polypeptide species with a molecular mass of 180 kDa in HEK 293 cells transfected with pCISNR2A (see Fig. 1 A). The 180-kDa species is coincident with that previously identified as the NR2A subunit (19Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This band was abolished by the prior incubation of the antibody with peptide-(1381–1394). Anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) antibodies displayed no immunocross-reactivity with other NMDA receptor subunits when used against HEK 293 cells transfected with the cDNAs encoding the NR1-1a, NR2B, NR2C, or NR2D subunit (see Fig.1 A). Anti-NR1 C2-(911–920), anti-NR2A/2B-(1435–1445), and anti-NR2B-(46–60) antibodies were as described previously (11Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Chazot P.L. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1176-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,19Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The anti-FLAG M2 and anti-c-Myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Dorset, United Kingdom). HEK 293 cells were cultured and transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (19Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Post-transfection, the cells were grown in the presence of 1 mm ketamine (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA) and harvested 24 h later. The NMDA receptor subunit clones pCISNR1-1a, pCISNR2A, and pCISNR2B were transfected at a ratio of 1:3:3, where the DNA encoding the NR2B subunit was represented by both the FLAG-tagged and c-Myc-tagged forms at a 1:1 ratio. HEK 293 cells were transfected with pCISNR1-1a in combination with pCISNR2B, pCISNR2BFLAG, or pCISNR2Bc-Myc. Twenty hours post-transfection, cell cytotoxicity was determined using the Promega CytoTox 96TM cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (9Chazot P.L. Coleman S.K. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24403-24409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Ro 25-6981 binding (20Mutel V. Buchy D. Klingelschmidt A. Messer J. Bleuel Z. Kemp J.A. Richards J.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2147-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was performed with both well washed cell homogenates prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with either NR1-1a/NR2B or NR1-1a/NR2BFLAG and immunoaffinity-purified NMDA receptors. The assay was performed in 50 mm Tris citrate, pH 7.1, containing 5 mm EGTA and 5 mm EDTA. Aliquots (100 μl) of the cell homogenate or immunoaffinity-purified NMDA receptor preparations were incubated in the presence of 0.1–50 nm [3H]Ro 25-6981 at 4 °C for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was defined by 1 mm spermidine. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through either GF/B filters (cell homogenates) or GF/B filters pretreated with 1% polyethyleneimine for 2 h immediately prior to assay (purified samples), followed by five washes with phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C using a Brandel cell harvester. An anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity column was synthesized by the directional coupling of affinity-purified anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) antibodies to protein A-Sepharose using an immunopure IgG orientation kit (Pierce). The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity column was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HEK 293 cells cotransfected with NR1-1a, NR2A, NR2BFLAG, and NR2Bc-Myc clones were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors as described (11Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity purification was performed as described for native forebrain NMDA receptors (12Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with antigen elution of the affinity column with 50 mm diethylamine, pH 11.5, containing 0.05% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and immediately quenched to a neutral pH with 2 m glycine. The eluted NR2A-containing fractions were pooled and assayed for [3H]Ro 25-6981 radioligand binding activity, or alternatively, they were applied to the anti-FLAG antibody affinity column for 2 h, recirculating at 25 ml/h at 4 °C. The column was washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5m NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at 25 ml/h for 2 h at 4 °C. Elution of the anti-FLAG antibody affinity column was as described above. The NR2A/NR2BFLAG-containing fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using the different NMDA receptor subunit-specific antibodies available. Additionally, the percentage co-association of NR2A and NR2B subunits in the NR1-1a/NR2A/NR2B-transfected cells was determined by quantitative immunoblotting. Thus, equal volumes of the detergent-solubilized cell homogenates and the anti-NR2A antibody affinity column filtrates were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using anti-NR2A, anti-c-Myc, and anti-FLAG antibodies. The percentage NR2 subunit retention by the anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity column was calculated, and the respective immunoreactivities in the anti-NR2A antibody affinity column filtrates were expressed as a percentage of the activities in the original detergent-solubilized extracts. Membranes prepared from adult rat forebrain were solubilized with 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate and 0.15m NaCl, pH 9, for 30 min at 37 °C, and NMDA receptors were purified on anti-NR1 C2 and anti-NR2A antibody affinity columns in series as described (12Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The double immunoaffinity-purified material was analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-NR1 C2 and anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) antibodies. Thus, a fixed volume (100 μl) of the double purified material was precipitated and analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using a range of primary antibody concentrations (0–50 μg/ml), and the ratio of NR1 to NR2 subunits was determined at the saturating antibody concentrations, i.e. 50 μg/ml for each antibody. Note that ideally, the anti-NR2A/2B-(1435–1445) antibody would have been used for this quantitative analysis; however, when the antibody concentration dependence in immunoblots was studied, saturation was not obtained. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 7% polyacrylamide slab gels under reducing conditions. Samples were prepared using the chloroform/methanol method of protein precipitation (19Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Anti-NR1 C2, anti-NR2A, and anti-NR2B antibodies were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myc antibodies were used at final dilutions of 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively. Rabbit and mouse immunoglobulin horseradish-linked whole antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used at a final dilution of 1:2000. Immunoreactivities were detected using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Where applicable, immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, California) in the linear range of the film (12Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Expression of the FLAG-tagged and c-Myc - tagged forms of the NR2B subunit was verified by immunoblotting. The anti-FLAG and anti-c-Myc antibodies both recognized a species with a molecular mass of 180 kDa in HEK 293 cells transfected with the respectively tagged NR2B subunit (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 6). The 180-kDa species is consistent with that previously identified as the NR2B subunit (11Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, the anti-c-Myc antibody detected multiple bands with molecular masses lower than that described for the NR2B subunit. These bands were also observed in untransfected HEK 293 cells and thus are cellular proteins that are immunoreactive with the anti-c-Myc antibody. The anti-NR2B-(46–60) antibody recognized a single polypeptide species of 180 kDa in HEK 293 cells transfected with the wild-type NR2B subunit (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). However, anti-NR2B-(46–60) antibody immunoreactivity was not detected in HEK 293 cells transfected with either of the epitope-tagged forms of the NR2B subunit (Fig.1 B, lanes 8 and 9). The introduction of the epitope tags between amino acids 53 and 54 of the NR2B subunit was coincident with the peptide sequence used to raise the anti-NR2B-(46–60) antibody; thus, the epitope recognized by the anti-NR2B-(46–60) antibody was abolished. However, quantitative immunoblots of HEK 293 cells transfected with either NR2BFLAG or NR2Bc-Myc probed with the anti-NR2A/B-(1435–1445) antibody showed that the two 180-kDa epitope-tagged forms of the NR2B subunit were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 1 B, lanes 10–12). Receptor-mediated cytotoxicity was used to assess whether the epitope-tagged NR2B subunits were capable of co-associating with the NR1-1a subunit to form functional receptors. It was found that HEK 293 cells transfected with NR1-1a/NR2BFLAG or NR1-1a/NR2Bc-Myc gave 94.6 ± 9.9 and 94.8 ± 10.2% of the receptor-mediated cytotoxicity observed with NR1-1a/NR2B, respectively. Furthermore, HEK 293 cells transfected with either NR1-1a/NR2B or NR1-1a/NR2BFLAG displayed similar affinities for the NR2B-selective ligand [3H]Ro 25-6981, with KD values of 10.5 ± 1.7 and 8.2 ± 3.6 nm (means ± S.E.), respectively. Fig.2 shows the saturation curves for the binding of [3H]Ro 25-6981 to wild-type and NR1/NR2BFLAG receptors. These results demonstrate that, indeed, the epitope-tagged NR2B subunits do assemble with the NR1-1a subunit to form receptors that show no significant difference in properties from wild-type NR1-1a/NR2B receptors. In this study, consistent with results previously reported (11Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 m NaCl solubilized ∼50% of the NR1 and NR2 subunit immunoreactivities expressed in HEK 293 cells transfected with NR1-1a/NR2A/NR2BFLAG/NR2Bc-Myc clones. The solubilized material was subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography as shown in Fig. 3 A, and immunoblotting was used to characterize the purified receptors. Initially, the solubilized preparation was applied to an anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity column, and the material before and after affinity column application was assayed for anti-NMDA receptor subunit antibody immunoreactivities. The anti-NR2A antibody column was not 100% efficient since only 67 ± 18% (n = 4) of the anti-NR2A antibody immunoreactivity was retained (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2). Further quantification of the immunoblots revealed that only 20 ± 4% (n = 2) of the solubilized anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 2) and 26% (n = 1) of the anti-c-Myc antibody immunoreactivities were retained by the anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity column. In the eluted fractions, anti-NR2A antibody immunoreactivity was detected (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) in addition to anti-FLAG, anti-c-Myc, and anti-NR1 C2 antibody immunoreactivities (Figs.3 C, lane 3; and Fig.4, lanes 5 and 11). The presence of anti-NR1 C2 antibody immunoreactivity in anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity-purified material is consistent with the co-association of NR1 and NR2 subunits within the same NMDA receptor complex.Figure 4Demonstration of the coexistence of three NR2 subunits in the same NMDA receptor complex. Solubilized recombinant NR1-1a/NR2A/NR2BFLAG/NR2Bc-Myc-containing NMDA receptors were purified by anti-NR2A and anti-FLAG antibody immunoaffinity chromatography in series. The double immunoaffinity-purified material was analyzed by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10, solubilized material; lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11, anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity-purified material;lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12, anti-NR2A/anti-FLAG antibody immunoaffinity-purified material.Lanes 1–3 were immunoblotted with the anti-NR2A antibody;lanes 4–6 with the anti-c-Myc antibody; lanes 7–9 with the anti-FLAG antibody; and lanes 10–12 with the anti-NR1 C2 antibody. The positions of the molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons) are shown on the right. This blot is representative of at least three immunoaffinity purifications from three independent transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The NR2A-purified material was subjected to further immunopurification using the anti-FLAG antibody affinity column. The results are shown in Fig. 3 C. It can be seen that all the anti-FLAG antibody immunoreactivity was retained by the anti-FLAG antibody immunoaffinity column (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3 and 4). The affinity column eluate was further analyzed by immunoblotting. Anti-NR2A, anti-FLAG, and anti-NR1 C2 antibody immunoreactivities were all detected in the double immunoaffinity-purified preparation (Fig. 4, lanes 3, 9, and 12). More important, the immunoblots also demonstrated in the eluted fractions the presence of anti-c-Myc antibody immunoreactivity (Fig. 4, lane 6). The detection of anti-c-Myc antibody immunoreactivity in material that has been purified on anti-NR2A and anti-FLAG antibody immunoaffinity columns in series demonstrates the presence of a population of recombinant NMDA receptors that contain the NR2A subunit co-associated with NR1-1a and both the FLAG- and c-Myc-tagged forms of the NR2B subunit, i.e. in this receptor population, three NR2 subunits are co-associated within one receptor complex. Interestingly, when the anti-NR2A, anti-FLAG, and anti-c-Myc antibody signals in the double immunopurified material were quantified, they gave a ratio of 1:1:1 (Fig. 4, lanes 3, 6, and 9). It should be pointed out, however, that these measurements were made using different specificity antibodies at single antibody concentrations. Full concentration-dependent immunoblots will be required to verify this ratio. The above-described results demonstrate that three NR2 subunits can co-assemble within an NMDA receptor molecule. If the NMDA receptor has a quaternary pentameric structure, this would imply two NR1 subunits/receptor. To test this prediction, the ratio of NR1 to NR2 subunits in recombinant NMDA receptors was determined by quantitative immunoblotting as described previously for the determination of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit stoichiometry (21Pollard S. Thompson C.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21285-21290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, cloned NR1-1a/NR2BFLAG receptors were purified by anti-NR1 C2 followed by anti-FLAG antibody immunoaffinity chromatography. Receptor-containing fractions from the double immunoaffinity-purified material were pooled and analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using a fixed amount of antigen, but varying the appropriate antibody concentrations, i.e. anti-NR1 C2 and anti-FLAG antibodies. A typical antibody concentration dependence curve and corresponding immunoblot are shown in Fig. 5. For all the quantitative immunoblots, the immunoreactive signal at 50 μg/ml antibody was a linear function of antigen concentration. The NR1/NR2 subunit ratio for cloned receptors determined at 50 μg/ml antibody was 1:1.5 ± 0.5 for three independent double immunoaffinity-purified preparations of cloned NR1-1a/NR2BFLAG receptors (data not shown). It is necessary to determine the NR1/NR2 subunit ratios in native receptors to show that the value obtained for the cloned receptors was not an artifact of the expression system. Thus, NMDA receptors were purified from adult rat forebrain by anti-NR1 C2 followed by anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity chromatography. As described above for cloned receptors, the double immunoaffinity-purified material was analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting using anti-NR1 C2 and anti-NR2A antibodies (Fig. 5). The NR1/NR2 subunit ratio determined at 50 μg/ml antibody was 1:1.4 ± 0.2 for two independent double immunoaffinity-purified preparations (three immunoblots/preparation). From our previous work, this receptor population will be a mixture of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors, although the latter contributes only ∼16% to the total anti-NR1/NR2A antibody double purified population (12Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, this 1:1.4 ratio is an underestimate since the NR2 subunit concentration had to be determined using an anti-NR2A antibody (see “Immunoaffinity Purification of Recombinant and Native NMDA Receptors” under “Experimental Procedures”), thus not taking into account the NR2B subunits present in NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors. A pentameric receptor composed of two NR1 subunits and three NR2 subunits would have an NR1/NR2 subunit ratio, 2:3, i.e. 1:1.5. This value is approached for native receptors. More important, in all double immunoaffinity-purified receptor preparations, NR2 immunoreactivity was always greater than that found for NR1. To discount the possibility that the co-immunopurification of three NR2 subunits is an artifact of the solubilization procedure, control experiments were carried out in which the NMDA receptor subunits NR1-1a, NR2A, NR2BFLAG, and NR2Bc-Myc were expressed individually in HEK 293 cells. Homogenates prepared from cells transfected with the different individual subunits were pooled, solubilized, and subjected to anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity purification as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that anti-NR2A antibody immunoreactivity was detected in the anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity column eluate (Fig. 6, lane 3). In contrast, anti-NR1 C2, anti-FLAG, and anti-c-Myc antibody immunoreactivities, while detected in the solubilized preparation both before and after anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity purification, could not be detected in the anti-NR2A antibody immunoaffinity column eluate (Fig. 6, lanes 6, 9, and 12). This result indicates that the co-immunopurification of three NR2 subunits is unlikely to be due to the random aggregation of NMDA receptor subunits during the solubilization procedure. Despite the fact that NR2 and, more important, NR1-1a subunits are both copurified by the different specificity anti-NR2 antibody immunoaffinity columns in series, it could be argued that the co-association of the NR1 subunit(s) and three NR2 subunits may be an artifact of the expression system. In the transfected HEK 293 cells, the subunits are overexpressed, and there is a potential for random subunit association. The purified receptor preparations therefore would not then be representative of functional, native NMDA receptors. To address this problem, the binding of the NR2B-specific radioligand [3H]Ro 25-6981 to immunopurified receptors was utilized. [3H]Ro 25-6981 is an NR1/NR2B-selective, activity-dependent, noncompetitive antagonist. It has been shown in functional studies to antagonize NR1/NR2B receptors with a >5000-fold selectivity compared with other binary subunit combinations (22Fischer G. Mutel V. Trube G. Malherbe P. Kew J.N.C. Mohacsi E. Heitz M.P. Kemp J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar). Here, [3H]Ro 25-6981 binding was carried out in HEK 293 cells transfected with either single or double combinations of NMDA receptor clones. We observed high affinity [3H]Ro 25-6981 binding to NR1-1a/NR2B receptors, with no detectable binding to NR1-1a, NR2A, or NR2B subunits expressed alone or to NR1-1a/NR2A or NR1-1a/NR2C hetero-oligomers (Fig. 7 A), confirming the selectivity found by Fischer et al. (22Fischer G. Mutel V. Trube G. Malherbe P. Kew J.N.C. Mohacsi E. Heitz M.P. Kemp J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar) and Hawkins et al. (23Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: P1Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we have determined the NR2 subunit copy number of NR1-1a/NR2A/NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. If these receptors, a subunit combination that is known to exist in vivo albeit as a minor subset (12Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2138-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), retain the ability to bind [3H]Ro 25-6981, it would demonstrate that NR1-1a/NR2A/NR2B receptors must be appropriately assembled. Thus, HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with NR1-1a, NR2A, and NR2B clones. Cell homogenates were prepared and solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5m NaCl, and receptors were purified by anti-NR2A antibody affinity chromatography. The eluted fractions, i.e. NR2A subunit-containing NMDA receptors that will comprise NR1-1a/NR2A, NR1-1a/NR2A/NR2B, and even monomeric NR2A, were analyzed by both immunoblotting and [3H]Ro 25-6981 radioligand binding. Representative results are shown in Fig. 7 (B–D). In Fig. 7 B, it can be seen that specific [3H]Ro 25-6981 binding was detected in the fractions eluted from the affinity column. Furthermore, the elution profile of [3H]Ro 25-6981-specific binding paralleled that for the NR1, NR2A, and NR2B immunoreactivities, which were all detected in the purified receptor preparation (Fig. 7 C). The copurification of the NR2B subunit on the anti-NR2A antibody affinity column is not an artifact of receptor aggregation, solubilization, or immunocross-reactivity since control experiments as described above showed that no anti-NR2B antibody immunoreactivity was retained and eluted from an anti-NR2A antibody affinity column when HEK 293 cells transfected with single subunit NMDA receptor clones were pooled, solubilized, and purified (see “Demonstration That the Co-association of Three NR2 Subunits Is Not an Artifact of the Solubilization Procedure”). Saturation analysis revealed that [3H]Ro 25-6981 bound with a single high affinity site, KD = 10.9 nm (n = 2), to the anti-NR2A antibody-purified receptors (Fig. 7 D). Thus, the detection of high affinity binding of the use-dependent NMDA receptor antagonist to receptors purified by anti-NR2A antibody affinity chromatography implies binding to NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors since the other subunit combinations copurified on this affinity column do not bind [3H]Ro 25-6981 (Fig. 7 A). These receptors must be functional since, to bind [3H]Ro 25-6981, the receptor must be appropriately assembled. This study reports the isolation of recombinant NMDA receptors in which three NR2 subunits are co-assembled within the same NMDA receptor complex. Furthermore, the NR1/NR2 subunit ratio was determined for both native and recombinant receptors; this ratio suggested a greater number of NR2 compared with NR1 subunits per receptor. Thus, in context with previous studies that support the conclusion that at least two copies of the NR1 subunit co-assemble within the NMDA receptor complex (15Béhé P. Stern P. Wyllie D.J.A. Nassar M. Schoepfer R. Colquhoun D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1995; 262: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Premkumar L.S. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggest that the NMDA receptor is at least pentameric in structure. This is, however, at variance with the NR2 subunit copy number reported from electrophysiological studies. In one study, wild-type and mutant NR2B subunits were coexpressed with wild-type NR1 in Xenopus oocytes. Agonist activation of the resultant receptors identified three discrete receptor populations that corresponded to wild-type, mutant, and composite wild-type/mutant receptors. Analysis of the relative proportions of the three receptor populations formed by varying the ratio of the mutant to the wild-type NR2B subunit clones transfected was indicative of two NR2 subunits/NMDA receptor complex (17Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using an alternative mutant NR2B, NR2B(N589Q), Premkumar and Auerbach (16Premkumar L.S. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) also concluded that there are two copies of the NR2 subunit/NMDA receptor complex. However, Béhéet al. (15Béhé P. Stern P. Wyllie D.J.A. Nassar M. Schoepfer R. Colquhoun D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1995; 262: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) commented that their results from similar studies could not be explained by the presence of just two NR2 subunits. Similar methods were used to determine the number of NR1 subunits/receptor. The results again were inconclusive, with either two (15Béhé P. Stern P. Wyllie D.J.A. Nassar M. Schoepfer R. Colquhoun D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1995; 262: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 485-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) NR1 subunits/NMDA receptor complex. Attempts to resolve subunit copy numbers by the analysis of channel properties is limited by the elucidation of clearly defined phenotypes for all subunit combinations formed, which may explain the different results in the literature. In this study, biochemical methods were used to identify the subunit composition of recombinant NMDA receptors; and thus, the constraints of functional analysis are negated. It is important to note, however, that although we clearly identify a population of NMDA receptors in which three NR2 subunits are co-associated, the efficiency of solubilization and immunoaffinity purification dictates that these receptors are only representative of the total receptor population. Furthermore, our results have shown that when three NMDA receptor subunit clones are coexpressed, the result is a heterogeneous population of receptors with regard to their subunit compositions. This heterogeneity is in agreement with a previous study in which Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with the NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunit clones. Of the channels studied, 23% displayed properties distinct from those of either NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B receptors, consistent with the co-association of NR1/NR2A/NR2B subunits within the same receptor complex (24Brimecombe J.C. Boeckman F.A. Aizenman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11019-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It may be possible that expressed NMDA receptors are also heterogeneous with respect to subunit ratios within receptors, and it cannot therefore be excluded that a subpopulation of receptors that contain only two copies of NR2 is present. There is the further possibility that the isolated receptors could be an abnormal assembly of subunits caused by their high expression in transfected cells. Whatever the inconsistencies in the literature in the determination of NR1/NR2 subunit ratios, it is universally agreed that functional, native NMDA receptors contain NR1 and NR2 subunits. NR1 and NR2 subunits are both found in the double immunoaffinity-purified preparations described here despite the fact that only anti-NR2 subunit antibody affinity columns are used for NMDA receptor isolation. Furthermore, the control experiments that were carried out eliminated the possibility of nonspecific aggregation between NR1 and NR2 subunits during solubilization and purification. Significantly, we have also demonstrated that HEK 293 cells transfected with NR1-1a, NR2A, and NR2B clones and purified by anti-NR2A antibody affinity chromatography retain the ability to bind with high affinity the activity-dependent antagonist [3H]Ro 25-6981. Thus, the detection of high affinity [3H]Ro 25-6981 binding to receptors purified by anti-NR2A antibody affinity chromatography implies binding to NR1/NR2A/NR2B receptors and that these receptors are indeed functional. We thank Hoffmann-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland) for the generous donation of [3H]Ro 25-6981 and Drs. S. Nakanishi and M. Mishina for the gifts of the NMDA receptor clones."

K., Guilherme, A., Holik, J. J., Virbasius, J. V., Chawla, A., and Czech, M. P. (1997)Science 275, 1927–1930). Here we show that both endogenous GRP1 and ARF6 rapidly co-localize in plasma membrane ruffles in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-T) cells expressing human insulin receptors and COS-1 cells in response to insulin and epidermal growth factor, respectively. The pleckstrin homology domain of GRP1 appears to be sufficient for regulated membrane localization. Using a novel method to estimate GTP loading of expressed HA epitope-tagged ARF proteins in intact cells, levels of biologically active, GTP-bound ARF6 as well as GTP-bound ARF1 were elevated when these ARF proteins were co-expressed with GRP1 or the related protein cytohesin-1. GTP loading of ARF6 in both control cells and in response to GRP1 or cytohesin-1 was insensitive to brefeldin A, consistent with previous data on endogenous ARF6 exchange activity. The ability of GRP1 to catalyze GTP/GDP exchange on ARF6 was confirmed using recombinant proteins in a cell-free system. Taken together, these results suggest that phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)P3 may be generated in cell membrane ruffles where receptor tyrosine kinases are concentrated in response to growth factors, causing recruitment of endogenous GRP1. Further, co-localization of GRP1 with ARF6, combined with its demonstrated ability to activate ARF6, suggests a physiological role for GRP1 in regulating ARF6 functions.

We recently identified a protein, GRP1, that binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with high affinity through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and contains a Sec7 homology domain that catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins (7Klarlund J.K.

However, neither the cellular localization nor the regulation of endogenous GRP1-like proteins has yet been characterized. ARF proteins appear to regulate membrane trafficking pathways and are converted from a biologically inactive, GDP-bound state to an active, GTP-bound form by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (14Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Six different mammalian isoforms of ARF have been identified and classified based on size and sequence similarities: ARF1, -2, and -3 in class 1; ARF4 and -5 in class 2; and ARF6 in class 3 (14Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).

The specificity of Sec7 domains for catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF proteins is at present unresolved. Frank et al. (22Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) observed that GTP loading of ARF6 in vitro was increased by ARNO, while in other studies by two independent laboratories, recombinant GRP1 appeared not to catalyze ARF6 exchange using different assay methods (8Klarlund J.K.

(23Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Gould B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These authors have proposed that ARF6 is not a substrate for GRP1. However, in contrast to this idea, the co-localization of ARNO and the rat homologue of cytohesin-1 with ARF6 rather than ARF1 (12Ashery U. Koch H. Scheuss V. Brose N. Rettig J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) suggested further evidence of an interrelationship between GRP1-like proteins and ARF6. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify whether GRP1 is able to enhance GTP loading of ARF6 in intact cells, and to determine whether PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generation by receptor tyrosine kinases actually regulates the co-localization of endogenous GRP1 with ARF6. Here we show the wortmannin-sensitive translocation of endogenous GRP1 from intracellular stores to plasma membrane ruffles and the co-localization of heterologously expressed as well as endogenous GRP1 and ARF6 in membrane ruffles. Further, both GRP1 and the related protein cytohesin-1 cause significantly elevated levels of GTP-bound ARF6 when expressed in COS-1 cells, suggesting that ARF6 function is indeed regulated by these PH and Sec7 domain-containing proteins. Wild type and mutant ARF cDNA constructs were kindly provided by Dr. V. Hsu, and myristoylated ARF6 protein was provided by Dr. J. Cassanova. The cDNA encoding cytohesin-1 was provided by Dr. B. Seed. Two different GRP1 cDNA constructs were synthesized containing C-terminal MYC (AEEQKLISEEDLLKG) or HA (YPYDVPDYA) epitope tags. The GRP1 Sec7, PH, and coiled-coil domains were fused at the C terminus with HA epitope tags and cloned into pCMV5 vectors. Affinity-purified GRP1 antibodies were produced by injecting rabbits with a GRP1-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein attached to glutathione-conjugated agarose beads. Antibodies directed against GST were removed with several incubations with lysates of bacteria expressing GST. Serum was then incubated with GRP1-GST immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) and washed with Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and Tris-NaCl buffer (10 mmTris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5). Antibodies were eluted first with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and then 100 mmtriethylamine (pH 11.5). Antibodies found in the glycine and triethylamine eluates were pooled and stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. The anti-MYC monoclonal antibody MYC1–9E10.2 (American Type Culture Collection) was produced against a human c-MYC polypeptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (24Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Anti-HA polyclonal antiserum was produced in rabbits using a polypeptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum R-6037 was produced against the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of ARF1 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Anti-ARF antibodies were purified and concentrated from R-6037 antiserum on a protein A-Sepharose column. These antibodies bind ARF1, -5, and -6 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Human insulin was a gift from Eli Lilly. [32P]orthophosphate and [35S]GTPγS were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. COS-1 cells were grown in six- or 12-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO-T cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human insulin receptors) (25Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) were grown in six- or 12-well tissue culture plates using F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. 2 × 105 CHO-T cells or 1 × 105 COS-1 cells were seeded on sterile 22-mm glass coverslips in six-well tissue culture plates and transfected the following day with 3–100 ng of the desired cDNA constructs. The precise amount of each cDNA construct to be transfected was optimized to obtain low expression levels using immunofluorescence as an end point. A total of 1 μg of DNA (including appropriate amounts of pCMV5 DNA) and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used per well in serum-free medium. Five hours after the addition of DNA to the cells, the medium was removed and replaced with medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. CHO-T cells were stimulated with insulin (100 nm for 3 min) 24 h post-transfection and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (171 mm NaCl, 10.1 mmNa2HPO4, 3.35 mm KCl, 1.84 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2). COS-1 cells were stimulated with 20% fetal bovine serum or epidermal growth factor (EGF; 312 ng/ml for 3 min) and similarly fixed. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS plus 1% FBS (buffer A) for 15 min and incubated for 2 h with the IgG fraction of polyclonal rabbit anti-HA peptide antiserum (2–4 mg/ml) or anti-MYC epitope antibody (1:10 dilution of tissue culture supernatant). The coverslips were washed extensively with buffer A and then incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine. Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin was added concurrently with secondary antibodies. The coverslips were again washed extensively with buffer A then rinsed once with PBS and mounted on slides with 90% glycerol in PBS plus 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane. COS-1 and CHO-T cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates, serum-starved for 16 h, and treated or not treated with 50 μm brefeldin A or 100 nm wortmannin for 10 min. Cells were then stimulated with 312 ng/ml EGF (COS-1 cells) or 100 nm insulin (CHO-T cells) for 3 or 10 min, respectively, and then washed with PBS and fixed with 100% methanol for 6 min at −20 °C. Cells were again washed with PBS, incubated for 15 min in buffer A, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 25 μg/ml affinity-purified anti-GRP1 antiserum or 3 μg/ml protein A-purified anti-ARF antiserum diluted in buffer A. Cells were washed with buffer A, incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for 30 min, washed again with buffer A, postfixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and then mounted on slides with 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane. Four sets of approximately 40–75 cells per condition (160–300 cells total) were scored with regard to GRP1 in membrane ruffles or disruption of the Golgi caused by brefeldin A. In vitro guanine nucleotide exchange assays were done according to the protocol of Frank et al (22Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Briefly, myristoylated ARF6 protein (1.0 μm) was combined with 1.5 mg/ml azolectin vesicles and 4 μm [35S]GTPγS in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol). 50 nm GRP1-GST fusion protein was added to experimental tubes with or without 50 μm brefeldin A. Reactions were stopped at 2, 4, 7, 10, 20, and 40 min by adding ice-cold assay buffer to each reaction tube. Samples were then filtered through nitrocellulose membranes using a Bio-Rad BIO-DOT apparatus and washed exhaustively with cold assay buffer to remove unbound [35S]GTPγS from the ARF6 retained on the membranes. ARF6-bound [35S]GTPγS was quantitated by counting washed nitrocellulose membranes in a Beckman LS 5000 β-counter. To investigate GTP loading of ARF proteins in intact cells, COS-1 cells were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well. The following day, cells were transfected with varying amounts of HA-tagged ARF1 or ARF6 and with GRP1, cytohesin-1, or pCMV5 vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were transferred to phosphate and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 2 mm pyruvate, and 375 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 16 h. Brefeldin A (50 μm, 5 min) was added directly to the tissue culture medium. Spent medium was aspirated from each well and replaced with 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% cholate, 0.005% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm vanadate). Cell lysates were scraped from each well and cleared by centrifugation. Each supernatant (50 μl) was analyzed by Western blotting, and the remainder was transferred to fresh tubes containing 5 μl of anti-HA polyclonal antiserum and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitations were conducted at 4 °C for 2 h and followed by extensive washing of the protein A beads with ice cold wash buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% cholate, 0.005% SDS). 20 μl of elution buffer (75 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm GDP) was added to each tube, heated to 85 °C for 3 min, and spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Merck). Chromatography was conducted for approximately 1 h using 0.65m KH2PO4 buffer (pH 3.4). After autoradiography, separated guanine nucleotides were visualized with UV light, cut from the chromatography plates, and counted in a Beckman LS 5000 β-counter. Western blots were performed on cell lysates according to established methods (26Klarlund J.K. Cherniak A.D. McMahon M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16674-16677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using anti-HA antiserum. To investigate the effect of PI 3-kinase activation on the subcellular localization of GRP1, CHO-T and COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged GRP1 and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-HA antibodies. Insulin stimulation of transfected CHO-T cells caused enhanced plasma membrane ruffling, as previously reported (27Kotani K. Hara K. Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Strikingly, insulin also caused translocation of expressed GRP1 from a mainly cytosolic distribution to plasma membrane ruffles (Fig.1 A), where phalloidin staining revealed the presence of polymerized actin. Serum and EGF had a similar effect on GRP1 and actin in transfected COS-1 cells (see Fig. 3 and data not shown). Agonist-stimulated GRP1 translocation was abrogated by the addition of 100 nm wortmannin to cells (data not shown), demonstrating the importance of PI 3-kinase activity for GRP1 recruitment to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that GRP1 is recruited to sites of insulin-mediated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis, which are predominantly in plasma membrane ruffles in CHO-T cells.Figure 3Graphic representation of insulin and EGF-induced translocation of GRP1 to membrane ruffles of CHO-T and COS-1 cells. Serum-starved CHO-T (A) and COS-1 (B) cells were treated or not treated with brefeldin A (BFA) (50 μm, 10 min) and then stimulated with 100 nm insulin (CHO-T) or 312 ng/ml EGF (COS-1). Cells were fixed, blocked, and immunolabeled with affinity-purified anti-GRP1 primary antibodies and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. 150–300 cells were scored blindly for the presence of GRP1 in membrane ruffles.C, CHO-T cells were treated or not treated with brefeldin A and stained with R-6037 anti-ARF primary antibodies and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. 150–300 cells were scored for disruption of the Golgi apparatus. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to test whether the PH domain of GRP1 is responsible for the agonist-stimulated translocation of GRP1 to the plasma membrane, CHO-T cells were transfected with HA-tagged constructs of each GRP1 domain, stimulated with insulin, and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-HA antibodies. In the absence of insulin, all expressed proteins exhibited a diffuse staining pattern, indicating a cytosolic or cytoplasmic membrane distribution (Fig. 1 A). Insulin stimulation resulted in the translocation of GRP1 and the GRP1 PH domain to the plasma membrane, where they were particularly prevalent in membrane ruffles (Fig. 1, A and B). However, the Sec7 and coiled-coil domains remained cytosolic in insulin-stimulated cells. These results are consistent with those reported by Venkateswarlu et al. (11Venkateswarlu K. Oatley P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) showing the PH domain-dependent translocation of ARNO to the plasma membrane of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin. To determine if endogenous GRP1 behaves similarly to the HA-tagged construct, we used affinity-purified anti-GRP1 polyclonal antiserum to label endogenous GRP1 in COS-1 and CHO-T cells. Endogenous GRP1 displayed a slightly more punctate and perinuclear pattern than did the overexpressed GRP1 but was similarly translocated to plasma membrane ruffles in response to insulin or EGF (Figs.2 A and3, A and B). Like expressed HA-tagged GRP1, endogenous GRP1 translocation was inhibited by wortmannin (data not shown). In order to determine if GRP1 is associated with Golgi membranes, cells were treated with brefeldin A prior to stimulation and labeling with anti-GRP1 antibodies. Brefeldin A had no effect on the localization or translocation of endogenous GRP1 in resting or stimulated cells (Figs. 2 A and 3, A and B). In contrast, cells labeled with an antibody preparation that recognizes ARF1, -5, and -6 show that brefeldin A effectively disrupted Golgi structure (Figs. 2 B and3 C). Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 show that both heterologously expressed and endogenous GRP1 are translocated to the plasma membrane of CHO-T and COS-1 cells in response to insulin and EGF, respectively, suggesting that ARF proteins located at the plasma membrane might be physiologically relevant substrates for GRP1. CHO-T cells were co-transfected with MYC-tagged GRP1 and HA-tagged ARF6 constructs and then stimulated with insulin. In unstimulated cells under these conditions, GRP1 was located primarily in the cytosol or intracellular membranes, while ARF6 was detectable throughout the plasma membrane (Fig. 4). Upon insulin stimulation, however, ARF6 and GRP1 were strikingly co-localized in plasma membrane ruffles. ARF6 has been observed to reside predominantly in the plasma membrane as well as intracellular vesicles (16D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

Using a polyclonal anti-ARF6 antibody (gift of Dr. J. Donaldson), we also find that endogenous ARF6 is concentrated in the membrane ruffles of CHO-T cells following insulin stimulation (data not shown). Similar results were seen in COS-1 cells co-transfected with GRP1 and ARF6 and stimulated with EGF or fetal bovine serum (data not shown). The co-localization of endogenous GRP1 and ARF6 in CHO-T cell plasma membrane ruffles is consistent with the hypothesis that GRP1 can catalyze guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF6 in intact cells. To test this, we first attempted to confirm the results of Frank et al. (22Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), using their in vitro guanine nucleotide exchange assay that combines recombinant myristoylated ARF6 with azolectin lipid vesicles, [35S]GTPγS, and exchange factor (GRP1). GTP loading of ARF6 was estimated by the amount of radioactive GTPγS associated with ARF6 at various time points. In contrast to negative results we previously obtained under different assay conditions (8Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), GRP1 enhanced the rate of ARF6 binding to labeled GTPγS approximately 4-fold as compared with ARF6 incubated without GRP1 (Fig. 5). The fact that this enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange on ARF6 was not sensitive to brefeldin A is consistent with previous reports that ARF6 activation both in vivo and in vitro is brefeldin A-resistant (17Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K.

We next developed a novel method to assess GTP loading of ARF proteins in intact cells. COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-tagged wild type and mutant ARF6 constructs or pCMV5 control vector and then labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The level of GTP-bound ARF was determined by measuring the ratio of radiolabeled GTP:GDP bound to ARF protein immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-HA antiserum. Using this method, cell lysates from pCMV5-transfected cells yielded no labeled guanine nucleotide after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antiserum (Fig. 6). The wild type, T27N (constitutively inactive), and Q67L (constitutively active) ARF6 constructs expressed well, and upon their immunoprecipitation they yielded the expected changes in ratios of labeled GTP:GDP (Fig.6). This assay was then used to test the ability of GRP1 and cytohesin-1 to activate ARF1 and ARF6 in intact cells (Fig.7). COS-1 cells were co-transfected with three different concentrations of ARF1 or ARF6 to ensure comparable expression levels in the presence of GRP1 and cytohesin-1. The amounts of labeled guanine nucleotides (GTP and GDP) bound to ARF proteins were detected on chromatography plates (Fig. 7 A), and the levels of ARF proteins detected by Western blots of cell lysates (Fig.7 B) indicated adequate ARF protein expression levels for all three transfection concentrations. Both ARF1 and ARF6 showed a significant increase in labeled GTP loading when co-transfected with GRP1 or cytohesin-1 as compared with control vector (Fig.7 C). Generally, a small decrease in the amount of ARF activation was seen as the amount of transfected ARF was increased, probably due to a decreasing ratio of endogenous and transfected guanine nucleotide exchange factor to ARF protein as amounts of transfected ARF increased. The ability of GRP1 and cytohesin-1 to activate ARF1 and ARF6 in intact cells in the presence or absence of brefeldin A was then examined using this assay (Fig. 8). In the absence of transfected GRP1 or cytohesin-1, brefeldin A inhibited GTP loading of ARF1 by about 50% (Fig. 8 B), suggesting that the endogenous exchange factor or factors for ARF1 in COS-1 cells are brefeldin A-sensitive. In contrast, ARF6 showed no significant decrease in labeled GTP binding in the presence of brefeldin A, indicating that endogenous ARF6 guanine nucleotide exchange factors are not sensitive to brefeldin A. ARF1 co-transfected with GRP1 or cytohesin-1 showed a slight decrease in activation when treated with brefeldin A. This is probably due to the inhibition of endogenous guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity but not the transfected GRP1 or cytohesin-1, because the magnitude of the decreases matched that observed in the absence of transfected GRP1 or cytohesin-1. The activation of ARF6 co-transfected with GRP1 or cytohesin-1 was not affected by brefeldin A. Western blots conducted on cell lysates showed comparable expression levels of ARF6 for each condition (data not shown). The data presented in Fig. 8, indicating that GRP1 can cause GTP loading of ARF6 expressed in COS-1 cells, is consistent with the results of Fig. 4 indicating that both GRP1 and ARF6 are present in the same cellular compartment. These data are also consistent with the demonstration by Frank et al. (22Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Cassanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and with our data (Fig.5) showing that recombinant ARNO, GRP1, and cytohesin-1 proteins can actively cause GTP loading of recombinant ARF6 protein in cell-free conditions. ARF1 binding to GTP is also enhanced by GRP1 in both cell-free (8Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and intact cell (Figs. 7 and 8) assays. However, little or no ARF1 is normally found in plasma membranes (17Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and thus may not be a target of GRP1 in untransfected cells. We have observed that high expression levels of ARF1 in COS-1 cells result in the mistargeting of ARF1 to the plasma membrane as well as the Golgi and cytosol, where it normally resides. This may allow GRP1 and cytohesin-1 access to ARF1, allowing guanine nucleotide exchange to occur. Conversely, high expression levels of GRP1 may artificially affect endogenous ARF1 in intact cells, which raises concerns about the recent claim that GRP1 regulates Golgi function (23Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Gould B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The endogenous proteins may be sufficiently compartmentalized so that little, if any, interaction between GRP1 and ARF1 takes place. Consistent with this hypothesis, brefeldin A did not affect the localization or translocation of GRP1 in resting or stimulated cells but did have a dramatic affect on Golgi structure (Figs. 2 B and 3 C). Brefeldin A inhibited GTP loading of expressed ARF1 in COS-1 cells not expressing GRP1 (Fig. 8), indicating its endogenous exchange factor is not a GRP1-like protein. In contrast, levels of GTP-bound ARF6 under these conditions were not affected by brefeldin A, as would be expected if GRP1-like proteins functioned as endogenous ARF6 exchange factors. The action of insulin to recruit GRP1 to plasma membrane ruffles (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) suggests this cellular location as a primary site of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 generation in response to the hormone in CHO-T cells. This concept is consistent with the observed high affinity binding of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by the GRP1 PH domain (8Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which also localizes to membrane ruffles in response to insulin (Fig. 1). We cannot rule out the possibility that insulin stimulates PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 synthesis in other cellular locations that are not detected under the conditions of our experiments or that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 itself is recruited to membrane ruffles from its site of synthesis. Furthermore, our data do not directly demonstrate that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is localized to membrane ruffles. It is thought that major insulin receptor substrate proteins that serve as docking sites for PI 3-kinase are mostly bound to intracellular membranes rather than associated with plasma membranes (28Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 29Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, this concept has not been verified by high resolution electron microscopy. Thus, our present results (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) and those of Venkateswarlu et al. (11Venkateswarlu K. Oatley P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) showing that GRP1 and ARNO, respectively, are mostly recruited to the cell surface membrane in response to insulin are somewhat surprising. Our data raise important questions for future work related to the relationship between the localization of insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinases and their 3′-polyphosphoinositide products. The mechanism by which ARF6 becomes concentrated in membrane ruffles is not known. Interestingly, insulin stimulation of CHO-T cells transfected with GRP1 resulted in the polymerization of endogenous actin in membrane ruffles containing GRP1 (Fig. 1 A). ARF6 has also been shown to function in actin polymerization as well as cytoskeletal rearrangements and plasma membrane structural changes, processes that may be important for macropinocytosis, vesicular trafficking, cell spreading, and the alteration of cell surface area and shape (18Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J.

ARF6-induced membrane protrusions appear morphologically distinct from membrane ruffles induced by insulin and other growth factors (20Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Kotani K. Hara K. Kotani K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Recently, ARF6 has been implicated as a necessary element in macrophage phagocytosis (32Zhang Q. Cox D. Tseng C.C. Donaldson J.G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19977-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, Radhakrishna and Donaldson (18Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) reported that an inhibitor of actin polymerization, cytochalasin D, inhibits the ARF6-dependent cycling of the human interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit to the plasma membrane and the formation of aluminum fluoride-induced surface protrusions in ARF6-expressing cells. Thus, actin polymerization through GRP1 and ARF6 may represent a mechanism by which insulin regulates membrane structure or the cycling of proteins to and from the plasma membrane. Recent evidence that microinjected anti-GRP1 antibody modestly inhibits insulin-mediated membrane ruffling in 3T3-L1 cells (33Clodi M. Vollenweider P. Klarlund J. Nakashima N. Martin S. Czech M.P. Olefsky J.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 139: 4984-4990Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) indicates such a role for GRP1-like proteins in plasma membrane/cytoskeletal interactions. Taken together, these considerations suggest the hypothesis that GRP1 and related proteins may regulate cellular processes controlled by ARF6.

The amino-terminal ∼845 residues of each heavy chain associates with two different light chains to form an elongated, globular domain (S1)1 that contains the sites for ATP hydrolysis and actin binding (1Lowey S. Engel A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1994: 485-505Google Scholar). This domain is sufficient for powering the movement of actin filaments. The carboxyl-terminal ∼1100 residues of the myosin heavy chains associate to form an α-helical coiled-coil rod essential for myosin filament assembly. Crystallographic determination of the S1 structure and electron microscopic studies have contributed a great deal to our understanding of the structure of the molecule and mapping of the functional sites (2Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 3Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). The myosin catalytic domain is a compact structure formed by the amino-terminal ∼765 residues of the heavy chain. The ATP-binding pocket in this domain is formed by a structural motif that is shared with the kinesin family of microtubule-based motors and with G-proteins that are involved in signal transduction (4Vale R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The core motif is a seven-strand mostly parallel β-sheet that is flanked by three α-helices on each side. A large insertion into the core motif forms the actin binding surface and distinguishes the myosin structure from kinesin and the G-proteins. Extending from the myosin catalytic domain is an 85-Å-long α-helix that is stabilized by the binding of two myosin light chains. This domain is believed to act as a lever arm to amplify and transmit structural changes in the catalytic domain into relative motion of actin and myosin (5Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The light chain binding helix terminates in a proline that starts the long rod domain. Despite the extensive knowledge about the structure of the molecule, our understanding of the folding pathway is limited. It must involve the folding of catalytic domain, association of the light chains, and dimerization of the long COOH-terminal α-helical segment of the two heavy chains. Myosin light chains and various rod subfragments can be synthesized in bacteria and fold properly, suggesting an autonomous folding pathway (6De Lozanne A. Berlot C.H. Leinwand L.A. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2999-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Atkinson S.J. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 823-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wolff-Long V.L. Saraswat L.D. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23162-23167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, myosin head fragments of various lengths expressed in bacteria are functionally inactive, suggesting that eukaryotic factors acting post-translationally may be required for folding (9McNally E.M. Goodwin E.B. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7270-7273Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is now well established that, although the folding of a protein is largely directed by its amino acid sequence, this process is often mediated by accessory proteins known as molecular chaperones (10Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar, 11Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Chaperonins are a class of molecular chaperones that consist of multisubunit toroidal ring structures and are believed to mediate folding by providing a sequestered environment within the ring (12Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). The chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT) present in the eukaryotic cytosol, is a relatively new member of this class (13Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in the folding of actin; α, β, and γ tubulins; and an actin-related protein (14Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J.

The folding pathways of actin and tubulin are now understood in great detail due to the discovery that the folding of these proteins is mediated by CCT in the eukaryotic cytosol (19Lewis S.A. Tian G. Vainberg I.E. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have helped to elucidate the genetic, structural and mechanistic aspects of this chaperonin (12Hartl F.U.

Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). One intriguing anomaly of CCT-mediated folding is the apparently limited target range in comparison to the bacterial analog GroEL (22Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). However, a more general role for CCT in protein folding is slowly emerging. In addition to the substrates already mentioned, CCT has recently been shown to mediate the folding of the G-protein, Gα-transducin (21Farr G.W. Scharl E.C. Schumacher R.J. Sondek S. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CCT is also thought to be involved in the organization of the neuronal cytoskeleton and in hepatitis virus capsid assembly (13Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Here we present an analysis of the folding of the heavy meromyosin subfragment (HMM) of myosin synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and show that it is mediated by CCT. Dimerization of heavy chains and the association of heavy and light chains are accomplished efficiently. However, HMM synthesized in this system lacks a properly folded motor domain, and is defective in its actin binding properties. Thus, in addition to the protein folding machinery available in the reticulocyte lysates, myosin may require additional folding factors. The expression systems that are widely used for non-muscle myosin (5Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 23Spudich J.A.

On the other hand, the mouse myogenic cell line C2C12 has been successfully used for the expression of this myosin isoform (26Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Based on this, we hypothesized that the folding of skeletal muscle myosin may require specific folding factors present in muscle cells. Folding assays performed in the presence of C2C12 cytoplasmic extracts, yield significantly more “native-like” protein. This molecular form of HMM displays enhanced folding of the motor domain, improved actin binding properties, and stabilization of the coiled-coil α-helix. The skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin expression plasmid was constructed from a full-length chimeric cDNA corresponding to the epitope tagged embryonic chicken myosin cDNA previously described (26Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The HMM cDNA encodes amino acids 1–1293 of myosin and was inserted between the Eco RI and Xba I cloning sites of pGEM4 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) with the 5′ end of the cDNA adjacent to the plasmid Sp6 promoter (p4HMMa). The chicken fast skeletal muscle myosin light chain 2 cDNA (GenBank accession no. M11030) was provided by Dr. Fernando Reinach (27Reinach F.C. Fischman D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and LC3 cDNA was provided by Dr. Bruce Patterson (GenBank accession no. J00888). The LC2 and LC3 cDNAs were cloned adjacent to an SP6 promoter into plasmids pGEM3 and p73 (Promega Corp.), respectively (p3mLC2 and p73mLC3). The myosin coding regions of the expression constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmids for the HMM heavy chain and the essential (LC3) and regulatory (LC2) light chains were expressed by coupled transcription and translation in the TNT lysate system (Promega Corp.). The reactions were performed as per manufacturer's protocol, in the presence 80 μCi/100-μl reaction of [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). All translations were carried out at 30 °C for 2 h. The molar ratio of the three myosin expression plasmids was adjusted such that approximately equimolar amounts of myosin heavy and light chains are produced. Translation reactions (200 μl) containing newly synthesized HMM and light chains were depleted of ATP and exchanged into column buffer by rapid gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mm MES (pH 6.9), 100 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (18Melki R. Vainberg I.E. Chow R.L. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The effluent from the Sephadex column was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was applied directly to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in the same buffer; the other was incubated with 5 mm Mg2+ATP for an additional 60 min at 30 °C and then applied to the column. The elution characteristics of the 10 mm (inner diameter) × 30-cm-long Superose 6 column (flow rate of 0.25 ml/min) were calibrated using myosin, HMM, myosin S1, and myosin light chains, myoglobin, serum albumin, and other proteins. Column fractions (0.5 ml) were analyzed by scintillation counting and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The radioactive myosin heavy and light chains in the column fractions were quantitated by phosphorimaging of the dried SDS gels (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To analyze the effect of the S30 extract on folding, Mg2+ATP-depleted samples were supplemented with an equal volume of the S30 fraction (see below), brought to 5 mmMg2+ATP, and incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. The products were then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. For analysis by anion exchange chromatography, a 100-μl translation reaction was eluted on Sephadex G-50 spin column equilibrated with 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol (14Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The effluent was diluted 5-fold with this buffer and applied to a HR 5/5 Mono-Q column with dimensions 5 mm (inner diameter) × 5 cm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 20–500 mm MgCl2 over 14 min at flow rate of 1 ml/min. Column fractions were collected and analyzed by scintillation counting and SDS-PAGE. The myosin heavy and light chain subunits were analyzed by phosphorimaging of the SDS gels. Fractions from the gel filtration and anion-exchange columns were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein gel patterns were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semidry blotting apparatus (29Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar), and the nitrocellulose replicas were probed with mAb 91A, a rat monoclonal antibody against TCP-1α subunit (30Willison K. Lewis V. Zuckerman K.S. Cordell J. Dean C. Miller K. Lyon M.F. Marsh M. Cell. 1989; 57: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The immunoreactive species were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Native immunoprecipitations were done with a 50-μl translation reaction that was depleted of Mg2+ATP and adjusted to 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) by elution from a Sephadex G-50 spin column. The effluent was incubated with 5 mm Mg2+ATPγS at 30 °C, for 60 min. After 2-fold dilution with the same buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 0.05% Triton X-100, the sample was divided into three aliquots and incubated with PBS or 5 μg of mAb 23C, a rat monoclonal antibody against TCP-1α subunit (17Sternlicht H.

Lowey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 595-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Incubations with primary antibodies were carried out for 4–6 h on ice, followed by 2–4 h of incubation with rabbit anti-rat IgG or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma). The secondary antibody was used in 2-fold excess over the primary antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were absorbed with formaldehyde-fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Immunoprecipitin; Life Technologies, Inc.). The pellets were washed four times with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and once with PBS and finally extracted into 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For some experiments, CCT was depleted from the lysates by immuunoabsorption prior to translation. Aliquots of rabbit reticulocyte lysate from the TNT lysate kit were incubated on ice for 60 min, with either mAb 23C or H2O (control). The immunocomplexes were then incubated with Immunoprecipitin for an additional 15 min. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and used in coupled transcription/translation assays as described above. Immunoprecipitation of denatured translation products with anti-S1 mAb 4H7.6 and anti-S2 mAb 10F12.3 was done with translation reaction aliquots equilibrated with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), then denatured by diluting with an equal volume of buffer containing 2% SDS and 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 10 min. After clarification with a brief microcentrifuge spin, samples were diluted with one volume of H2O and eight volumes of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Aliquots of the diluted sample were incubated either with buffer or 5 μg of the appropriate antibody. The subsequent processing steps were identical to native immunoprecipitation. Growth and fusion of C2C12 cells has been previously described in detail (26Kinose F. Wang S.X. Kidambi U.S. Moncman C.L. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 895-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Well differentiated myotubes, 3–4 days after fusion, were used to prepare an S30 fraction according to a protocol developed by Moldave and Fischer for Chinese hamster ovary cells (32Moldave K. Fischer I. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Myotubes growing on 100-mm dishes were washed once with 0.035 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.15 m NaCl, 0.011 m glucose, and collected into the same buffer by scraping the cell layer. The cell pellet was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in an equal volume of 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 0.015 m KCl, 0.0015 m magnesium acetate, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The cells were homogenized by 30–40 strokes in a Dounce glass homogenizer and adjusted to 0.02 m HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3), 0.12 mKCl, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The postmitochondrial fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The final step of the original protocol was modified to use 0.02m HEPES-KOH (pH 7.3), 60 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 6 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (S30 buffer). The buffer exchange was performed using G-50 spin columns that were presaturated with old reticulocyte lysate to avoid depletion of ribosomes (33Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). This buffer system was found to be most compatible with the translation buffer of TNT lysate system and yielded optimum levels of myosin heavy chain in our translations. The gel-filtered S30 fraction was dispensed into 100-μl aliquots, quick-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Typically, myotubes from 16–20 dishes yielded approximately 2 ml of S30 fraction with an absorbance of 10–12 A260 units/ml. Removal of endogenous mRNA from the S30 fraction was unnecessary since translation in the TNT assay without added exogenous plasmid resulted in background levels of [35S]methionine incorporation. Folding reactions were supplemented with native HMM at 2.5 mg/ml and subjected to limited proteolysis with 25 μg/ml bovine pancreas trypsin (Sigma) at 25 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at various times, diluted 10-fold into SDS sample buffer and boiled immediately, then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by immunoblotting with anti-myosin mAb 4H7.6, F59, 1H2.2, and 8G12.5 (31Winkelmann D.A. Lowey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 595-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The proteolytic fragments of nascent HMM were visualized by autoradiography of the immunoblots. Folding reactions were supplemented with the S30 fraction of a C2C12 myotube extract or an equal volumes of S30 buffer and incubated for an additional 60 min at 30 °C to continue folding. Samples were then supplemented with 2.5 mg/ml native HMM, digested with trypsin, and analyzed as already described. For immunoprecipitation analysis, samples from a 30-min time point were diluted 8-fold into SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. After clarification in a microcentrifuge, the samples were diluted 10-fold with S30 buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Aliquots of the diluted sample were incubated with either PBS or 10 μg of an anti-myosin mAb (4H7.6, F59, 1H2.2, or 8G12.5) and then analyzed as described above. Translations (50 μl) were performed either in rabbit reticulocyte lysate alone or in lysate supplemented with C2C12 extract, in a 1:10 ratio. The samples were eluted on Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with 25 mm imidazole, 25 mm KCl, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and supplemented with 0.25–0.30 mg/ml native HMM and 0.25 mg/ml F-actin and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The resulting actomyosin complexes were incubated for another 10 min with either 10 μg/ml apyrase, to eliminate ATP (Sigma), or 1 mmMg2+ATP. Actin and actomyosin complexes were obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 21 min. The pellets were extracted into 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. The supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, for the free and actin-bound HMM. Native HMM was prepared by chymotryptic digestion of adult chicken pectoralis major muscle myosin essentially according to Margossian and Lowey (34Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Addition of 5 mm MgCl2 prior to digestion was found to increase the yield of HMM. Skeletal muscle actin was prepared from an acetone powder of chicken pectoralis muscle according to Winkelmann et al. (35Winkelmann D.A. Kinose F. Chung A.L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 452-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We studied folding of de novo synthesized myosin in an eukaryotic expression assay. The HMM of myosin contains most of the structural and functional domains of myosin, and lacks only the light meromyosin subfragment (LMM). Myosin subfragments lacking LMM are soluble in low ionic strength buffers, making them more amenable for subsequent analysis. Therefore, most of our studies on myosin folding were carried out with the HMM heavy chain. The cDNAs for the HMM heavy chain and myosin light chains were cloned into plasmids adjacent to a bacterial SP6 promoter for expression in a coupled transcription and translation assay. The assay uses purified SP6 RNA polymerase for transcription and a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system. The coupled assay efficiently produces the myosin subunits (the 140-, 19-, and 17-kDa polypeptides for HMM, LC2, and LC3, respectively) when the plasmids are mixed (Fig.1). This permits the analysis of co-expressed nascent subunits for intermediates in the folding pathway. The plasmids for the heavy and light chain were used in a 2.2:1.25:1.0 (p4HMMa:p3mLC2:p73mLC3) molar ratio, in order to achieve comparable levels of synthesis of the three polypeptides. The time course of synthesis shows that full-length HMM heavy chains do not appear until 20 min after the start of the reaction, and reach maximum synthesis after 120 min of translation. On the other hand, light chains begin to accumulate within the first 5 min and quickly reach steady state by 20 min. Typically, a 2-h synthesis results in an incorporation of 10–15% of the added [35S]methionine into protein. It is now recognized that, although the folding of proteins is directed by their primary sequence, in many instances this process is aided by accessory proteins called molecular chaperones. Chaperonin-mediated folding of proteins involves rapid formation of a binary complex of nascent polypeptides with the chaperonin and a slow Mg2+ATP-dependent release of fully or partially folded protein from this complex (10Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3590) Google Scholar). Partially folded polypeptides repeat this cycle until folding is complete. In the absence of Mg2+ATP, polypeptides associated with a molecular chaperone often remain arrested in that form. To investigate if a similar mechanism underlies myosin folding, we depleted Mg2+ATP from translations containing nascent HMM subunits and analyzed the products by gel filtration chromatography (Fig.2). The chromatogram showed a major radioactive peak eluting at 11.25–12.25 ml. Native HMM elutes as a sharp peak at 9.25–9.75 ml with an apparent molecular mass that is higher (>2000 kDa) than the calculated mass (340 kDa) because of its highly asymmetric shape. The elution position of nascent HMM on the gel filtration column suggested a more compact shape or the association of HMM with a reticulocyte lysate protein (Fig. 2 a). This molecular form, designated as peak I (pI), accounts for approximately a third of the total radioactivity. Two additional peaks were also observed, one of which corresponds to free light chains, and the other to unincorporated [35S]methionine and [35S]methionyl-tRNA complex (data not shown). The effect of Mg2+ATP on the folding intermediates was shown by incubating an aliquot with 5 mmMg2+ATP prior to gel filtration. There is a dramatic conversion of pI into two new forms, peak II (pII) and peak III (pIII), after incubation with Mg2+ATP (Fig. 2 b). The elution position of pII corresponds to that of the native HMM, whereas pIII elutes in the void volume of the column. Quantitation of heavy and light chains in the different molecular forms showed equimolar ratios of these subunits in pI and pII, whereas the ratio in pIII is skewed toward the heavy chain. Recent evidence indicates that the folding of actin, tubulin and related proteins in the eukaryotic cytosol is mediated by CCT (14Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J.

A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To investigate if this chaperonin is also involved in myosin folding, the peak fractions were probed with mAb 91A (30Willison K. Lewis V. Zuckerman K.S. Cordell J. Dean C. Miller K. Lyon M.F. Marsh M. Cell. 1989; 57: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), an antibody against TCP-1 α subunit (Fig. 2 c). This antibody detected a 60-kDa polypeptide in the fractions corresponding to pI, suggesting that pI may be a complex of HMM with CCT. In the presence of Mg2+ATP, release of HMM into pII and pIII was accompanied by a decrease of TCP-1 immunoreactivity in pI. In addition, TCP-1 was also detected in pIII, but not pII. In both the cases, CCT subunits were also found in lower molecular mass fractions (120–60 kDa), suggesting disassembly of the CCT complex (36Liou A.K. McCormack E.A. Willison K.R. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 37Roobol A. Carden M.J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that the co-elution of TCP-1 with HMM in the gel filtration experiment is a consequence of similarities in their size, rather than a true association. To examine this possibility, the translation products were resolved on an anion-exchange column, using a buffer system developed by Gao et al. (14Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) for the purification of CCT from reticulocyte lysate. When a translation reaction depleted of Mg2+ATP was applied to a mono-Q column, more than 90% of the translated protein eluted as a single peak at ∼180"

In general, sensor kinases contain conserved carboxyl-terminal histidine residues that are autophosphorylated in the presence of ATP (3Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most sensors are membrane-bound and transfer the phosphate group to an aspartic acid residue in the amino terminus of the response regulator. The phosphorylated response regulator usually mediates control at the transcriptional level by binding to specific DNA sequences. The pmrA and pmrB genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encode products with sequence similarity to DNA binding response regulators and autophosphorylatable histidine kinases, respectively (4Roland K.L.

The pmrG gene is located upstream and transcribed in the opposite orientation of the pbgPE operon. Downstream of the pbgPE operon is the pmrD gene, which may also be PmrA-regulated because when present in a multicopy number plasmid, it confers polymyxin resistance in a PmrA-dependent manner (15Roland K.L. Esther C.R. Spitznagel J.K. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3589-3597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we characterize the PmrA-regulated promoters in Salmonella by determining the transcription start sites of four PmrA-regulated operons and identifying the DNA sequence to which the PmrA protein binds. Our experiments define two classes of PmrA-regulated genes as follows: those that are directly regulated by the PmrA protein (pmrCAB, pmrG, and pbgPE), and those that are regulated indirectly by the PmrA protein (ugd). E. coli JM109 was used as the host for the preparation of plasmid DNA. E. coli BL21(DE3) served as the host for overexpression of the PmrA protein and the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB (PmrBc) protein. To overproduce the PmrA protein, the chromosomal pmrA gene was PCR1-amplified with primer 351 (5′-AAG GAT CCA GGA GAC TAA GCG-3′) and six histidine tag (H6) containing primer 438 (5′-TCC AAG CTT AGT GGT GGT GGT GGT GGT GGC TTT CCT CAG TGG CAA CC-5′). The resulting 715-bp PCR product was digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII and cloned between the Bam HI and Hin dIII sites of pUHE21–2 lacI q to form pUHE-PmrA-H6. The pmrA gene containing the six histidine codons was cut out of pUHE-PmrA-H6 with Nd eI and Hin dIII and ligated into pT7-7. The cytoplasmic domain of pmrB was amplified with primer 988 (5′-AGA TAT ACA TAT GCA CCA CCA CCA CCA CCA CCG GCG TAT TAC CCG TCC GCT-3′) containing an initiation codon followed by a six-histidine tag and primer 353 (5′-ACG AAG CTT ATG CCT TTT TCA-3′). The resulting 845-bp PCR product was digested with Nd eI and Hin dIII and ligated into plasmid pT7-7. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned PCR products was verified by sequencing both strands. S. enterica serovar Typhimurium 14028s (16Fields P.I. Swanson R.V. Haidaris C.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5189-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) was used for chromosomal DNA and RNA isolation. Overnight cultures of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium grown in N-minimal medium (17Snavely M.D. Gravina S.A. Cheung T.-B.T. Miller C.G. Maguire M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 824-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pH 7.7, with 10 mm MgCl2 were washed 3 times in N-minimal medium, pH 7.7, without MgCl2 and diluted 1:50 into 50 ml of N-minimal medium, pH 7.7, containing either 10 μm or 10 mm MgCl2 or N-minimal medium, pH 5.8, containing 10 mm MgCl2. Total RNA was extracted from mid-exponential phase cultures (A600, 0.4–0.6) with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Primers used for cDNA synthesis were 935 (5′-AGA CGG CAA TAT AAA AGG AA-3′), located 56 bp downstream of the pmrC start codon; 955 (5′-CAT TAA CCT CTC AGG CAG AC-3′), situated 14 bp downstream of the start codon of the first gene in the pbgPE operon; 1069 (5′-ATA AAG CGT AGG GTA AAT GC-3′), located 5 bp downstream of the pmrG start codon; and 1007 (5′-GCA ATA AGC AAA CCA TTA GA-3′), located 36 bp downstream of the ugd initiation codon. The cDNA synthesis was performed with 30 μg of total RNA, 2 pmol of primer labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and [γ-32P]ATP and 50 units of SuperScriptTMII RnaseH−reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7.5m urea gel and compared with sequence ladders initiated with primers 935, 955, 1069, or 1007. Histidine-tagged PmrA and PmrBc proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) containing either plasmid pT7-PmrA-H6 (EG10067) or pT7-PmrBc-H6 (EG11751). Cells were grown in 500 ml of LB broth at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Then, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and incubation was continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested and suspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 3,000 ×g for 15 min. Three ml of 50% nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The PmrA-H6 and PmrBc-H6 proteins were washed 4 times with 10 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted with 4 ml of buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. DNA fragments used for gel mobility shift assay were amplified by the PCR using S. enterica serovar Typhimurium chromosomal DNA as a template. Prior to the PCR, primers 935, 955, and 1007, which anneal to the coding strand of pmrC, pbgPE, and ugd, respectively, were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The pmrC promoter region was amplified using primer 454 (5′-TCG AAT TCG ATC ACC GCG CTG-3′) and labeled primer 935. The pbgPE/pmrG promoter region was generated by PCR with primer 767 (5′-TCG CCG GAC GGG AGA AAG GC-3′) and labeled primer 955. The ugd promoter region was amplified with primer 977 (5′-CGG GAT CCG GGC TTT TTT TTA TCT C-3′) and labeled primer 1007. Approximately 25 amol of labeled DNA and 0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, or 250 pmol of PmrA-H6 protein in a 100-μl volume were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The binding buffer used for protein-DNA incubations was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 10% glycerol. Samples (20 μl) were run on a 4% non-denaturing Tris glycine polyacrylamide gel at 2 °C. After electrophoresis the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The PmrBc-H6 or PmrA-H6 proteins were incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 or 40 min, respectively, with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Phosphorylation of PmrA-H6 was accomplished by adding 0.5 pmol of autophosphorylated PmrBc-H6 to 1 pmol of PmrA in phosphorylation buffer. The reaction was stopped after 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 40 min with SDS loading buffer. The samples were run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. DNase I protection assays were done for both DNA strands using the appropriate labeled primer. PmrA-H6 protein was incubated with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated PmrBc-H6 for 20 min at RT as described above, except that instead of [γ-32P]ATP, ATP was used. Binding reactions with 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 pmol of PmrA-H6 protein and 25 amol of labeled DNA were performed as described for the gel mobility shift assay. DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) (0.05 units) was added and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 25 mm EDTA. DNA fragments were purified with Wizard DNA cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI) and resuspended in 30 μl of H2O. Samples (6 μl) were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide (6%) gel electrophoresis by comparison with a DNA sequence ladder generated with the appropriate primer. His-tagged PmrA protein (2 μg) was resuspended in SDS sample buffer with or without 2-mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To characterize the PmrA-regulated promoters, we determined the transcription start sites of the PmrA-activated genes pmrC, pmrG, pbgPE, and ugd. Expression of PmrA-activated genes is promoted during growth in low magnesium media in a process that requires the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system. But transcription of PmrA-activated genes can also be induced by growth in mild acidic conditions in a PhoP/PhoQ-independent manner mechanism (9Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10García-Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 11Gunn J.S. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6857-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To distinguish between PhoP/PhoQ-dependent and -independent transcription of PmrA-activated genes, total RNA was isolated from mid-exponential phase cultures of wild-type Salmonella grown in N-minimal media with 10 μmMg2+, pH 7.7, or 10 mm Mg2+, pH 5.8, respectively (9Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). RNA was also isolated from bacteria grown in N-minimal media, 10 mm Mg2+, pH 7.7, a condition that does not promote expression of PmrA-activated genes. A single primer extension product was obtained for the pmrC promoter, corresponding to an A residue located 23 nucleotides upstream of the pmrC start codon, with RNA isolated from bacteria grown under either inducing condition (Fig.2). Single transcription start sites were also detected for the pmrG and ugd promoters, corresponding to a G residue 104 bp upstream of the pmrG start codon and to an A residue 122 bp upstream of the ugd start codon (Fig. 2). In contrast, two major bands located 5 bp apart were observed for the pbgPE promoter (Fig. 2). S1 mapping experiments revealed that the top band, corresponding to an A residue 73 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of the pbgP1 gene, was the transcription start site (data not shown). The S1 mapping experiments revealed the same transcription start sites (data now shown) identified by primer extension for the pmrC, pmrG, and ugd genes (Fig. 2). On the other hand, no primer extension products were observed with RNA isolated from bacteria grown at 10 mm Mg2+, pH 7.7 (Fig. 2), consistent with previous results using lac gene fusions (9Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). That identical transcription start sites were detected when expression of PmrA-activated genes was induced by growth in low magnesium or by mild acidification suggests that these signals act by modifying the activity of the PmrA protein and argues against a model in which different promoters are used in response to different signals. We analyzed the DNA sequences 5′ to the transcription start sites of the pmrC, pmrG, pbgPE, and ugd genes by comparing them to known promoter consensus sequences. The promoters of theses PmrA-activated genes displayed similarity to E. coli ς70 promoters: the −10 regions of these promoters contained three out of the six conserved nucleotides, and the −35 regions contained three or four of the six conserved nucleotides (Fig. 6). The pmrG and pbgPE promoters also contain an 18-bp A + T-rich sequence upstream of the −35 region known as UP element (18Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To examine the ability of the PmrA protein to bind the promoter regions of PmrA-activated genes, we first constructed a derivative of the pmrA gene encoding a protein with six histidine residues at its amino terminus, and we showed that a plasmid encoding this pmrA derivative (pUHE-PmrA-H6) could restore transcription of the pmrC, pbgPE, pmrG, and ugd genes in a pmrA null mutant (data not shown). The PmrA-H6 protein could gel shift a 300-bp DNA fragment that included 215 bp upstream of the initiation codon of pmrC, and a 341-bp DNA fragment that included the initiation codons of the divergent pbgPE and pmrG genes (Fig. 3). The amount of PmrA-H6 protein needed for the gel shift of the pmrC and pbgPE/pmrG DNA fragments was similar: gel shifts were seen with 10 pmol of PmrA-H6 protein, and all of the input pmrC and pbgPE/pmrG DNA was in the complexed state in the presence of 250 pmol of protein. Band retardation was observed despite the presence of a large excess (1,000-fold) of competing salmon sperm DNA, suggesting that PmrA-H6 binds directly and specifically to the pbgPE/pmrG and pmrC promoter regions. In contrast, a 261-bp DNA fragment that includes 202 bp upstream of the ugd start codon could not be gel-shifted by 250 pmol of PmrA-H6 protein (Fig. 3), even when this protein was phosphorylated (data not shown). We purified the cytoplasmic domain of the PmrB protein (PmrBc-H6) and investigated its ability to autophosphorylate in the presence of ATP. The PmrBc-H6 protein was capable of efficient autophosphorylation (Fig. 4). Moreover, it could serve as a phosphate donor for the PmrA-H6 protein. Rapid phosphotransfer from the PmrBc-H6 to the PmrA-H6 protein was observed (Fig. 4). The half-life for phosphorylated PmrBc-H6 was 10 min when incubated with the PmrA-H6 protein in a 1:2 PmrBc-H6/PmrA-H6 stoichiometry. As expected, the PmrA-H6 protein alone showed no evidence of phosphorylation when incubated with ATP (Fig. 4, lane 10). To define experimentally the DNA sequence that the PmrA protein recognizes, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed on both the coding and non-coding strands of the pmrC and pbgPE/pmrG promoter fragments using both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PmrA-H6 protein. In the pmrC promoter, the PmrA-H6 protein protected from nt −49 to −28 relative to the transcription start site and from nt −57 to −31 in the non-coding strand of pmrC (Fig.5). Thus, there was an overlap of 19 bp between the two strands protected by the PmrA protein. In the pbgPE/pmrG promoter region, the PmrA-H6 protein also protected a single region of the coding (nt −46 to −26) and non-coding strand (nt −54 to −27), overlapping a region of 20 bp (Fig. 5). In addition, areas of hypersensitivity were observed flanking portions of the protected sites. The location of the hypersensitive site in the pbgPE coding strand was dependent on the phosphorylated state of the PmrA-H6 protein. At high protein concentrations, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PmrA-H6 protected the same region in the different promoters. On the other hand, at low protein concentrations phosphorylated PmrA-H6 protected this region better than unphosphorylated PmrA-H6. The protected sequences of the pmrC, pmrG, and pbgPE promoters were highly similar to one another (Fig. 6) and allowed us to define the following PmrA binding sequence: 5′-TTAA(G/T)TTCTTAA(G/T)GTT-3′, which includes an imperfect inverted repeat (Fig. 6). The PmrA-H6 protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel with or without 2-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer. In the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol the PmrA-H6 protein runs as a 50-kDa species, consistent with the notion that this protein can dimerize (Fig. 7). PmrA harbors a single cysteine at position 27, which may be responsible for disulfide bridge formation between two PmrA molecules. The dimer form of PmrA may bind the inverted repeat in the promoter regions of PmrA-activated genes to promote gene transcription. The two-component system PmrA/PmrB controls transcription of the pmrC, pmrG, pbgPE, and ugd genes (9Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,12Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Some of these genes encode products that mediate the modification of the lipid A by the addition of 4-aminoarabinose, which makes the microorganism 1,000-fold less susceptible to polymyxin B (12Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 13Groisman E.A. Kayser J. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7040-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We have defined the promoter region of the PmrA-regulated genes pmrC, pmrG, pbgPE, and ugd genes. When compared with known promoter consensus sequences (19Wösten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), they showed weak identity to the E. coli ς70 promoter consensus sequence, which is typical for activator-dependent promoters (20Raibaud O. Schwartz M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1984; 18: 173-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). PmrA belongs to the OmpR family of response regulators, which are generally transcribed by ς70 RNA polymerase (22Hakenbeck R. Stock J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 281-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activator proteins bind at various distances from weak promoters to enhance binding or open complex formation by RNA polymerase (23Busby S. Ebright R.H. Cell. 1994; 79: 743-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In the absence of activator protein, RNA polymerase forms open complexes poorly due to unfavorable interactions with the −35 and −10 elements of the promoter. The pmrG and pbgPE promoters both contain a possible 18-bp UP element located at positions −52 and −66, respectively, relative to the transcription start site, which could be a target for the carboxyl-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit. Binding of this domain to target promoters can increase promoter activity 2–20-fold (18Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Transcription of PmrA-activated genes is induced in response to mild acidic conditions (9Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or by a low extracellular magnesium concentration through interaction with the PhoP/PhoQ two-component system (10García-Véscovi E. Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 11Gunn J.S. Miller S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6857-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Transcription products for the pmrC, pmrG, pbgPE, and ugd genes were detected only under inducing conditions for the PmrA/PmrB two-component system. Moreover, the same transcription start site was detected whether bacteria were grown in low pH or in low extracellular magnesium. This indicates that the same promoter is used under different activating conditions (as supposed to different promoters being activated in response to different signals). A single retarded DNA-protein complex was detected for the pmrC and the pbgPE/pmrG promoter fragments indicating that these promoters contain only one PmrA-binding site. This notion is further supported by our DNase I footprinting analysis which showed that the PmrA-binding site is located around nt −40, −38, or −80 of the transcription start sites of pmrC, pbgPE, and pmrG genes, respectively. This location is in agreement with the DNA-binding sites of other activators, which are usually found between nt −30 and −80 with respect to the transcription start site (24Gralla J.D. Collado-Vides J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1232-1245Google Scholar). The PmrA protein protected a 16-bp sequence (5′-TTAAKTTCTTAAKGTT-3′) from DNase I, partially covering the potential −35 promoter region of the pmrC and pbgPE promoters (Fig. 6). This sequence includes an imperfect 9-bp inverted repeat, similar to the DNA-binding sites of many prokaryotic regulators that consist of 5–10-bp inverted repeat sequences (25Schleif R. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1300-1309Google Scholar). The dyad symmetry in the PmrA-binding sequence suggests that the PmrA protein binds to these sites as a dimer, and consistent with this notion we found that the PmrA protein can dimerize (Fig.7). There is single PmrA-binding site in the pbgPE-pmrG intergenic region, and this site is closer to the pbgPE promoter than to the pmrG promoter. A similar phenomenon has been described in the agr locus of Staphylococcus aureus where two divergent promoters, P2 and P3, contain a single binding site for the regulatory protein SarA (26Chien Y. Cheung A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2645-2652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The SarA location is closer to the P2 promoter, which is the most activated promoter. Further work will be required to examine whether the pbgPE promoter is preferentially activated relative to the pmrG promoter. Phosphorylation of response regulators is believed to prevent the activity of an inhibitory domain, allowing the amino terminus to dimerize or oligomerize and the carboxyl terminus to bind to the target DNA (27Fiedler U. Weiss V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3696-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, like the PhoP protein of Bacillus subtilis, the PmrA protein dimerizes and binds to DNA regardless of its phosphorylation state (28Liu W. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6302-6310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several response regulators also bind to their target promoters efficiently in their unphosphorylated form (29Boucher P.E. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Stibitz S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1755-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dahl J.L. Wei B.-Y. Kadner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1910-1919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but others, such as NarL and ComA, bind to their target genes only in phosphorylated form (31Roggiani M. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3182-3187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Walker M.S. DeMoss J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Yet, in all cases, phosphorylation of response regulators affects binding to the target promoters, often by increasing binding affinity such as in the case of the OmpR and PhoB proteins (33Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Makino K. Shinagawa H. Amemura M. Kawamoto T. Yamada M. Nakata A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A similar phenomenon is seen for PmrA, where 2–4-fold less protein is needed for full DNase I protection if phosphorylated PmrA protein is used instead of unphosphorylated PmrA. The high binding affinity of the unphosphorylated PmrA for its target DNA places PmrA in the same class of response regulators as the PhoP protein of B. subtilis, the UhpA protein of E. coli, and the BvgA protein of Bordetella pertussis (1Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Crossref Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this class of response regulators appears to only change the conformation of these proteins, resulting in transcription activation. The PmrA protein exhibited specific binding to the pmrC and pbgPE/pmrG promoter fragments. On the other hand, neither phosphorylated nor unphosphorylated PmrA protein could bind to the ugd promoter. This was surprising because genetic analysis of strains harboring ugd::lac fusions demonstrated that ugd transcription requires a functional pmrA gene (9Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6796-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The ugd gene codes for UDP glucose dehydrogenase which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-glucuronic acid, a precursor in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid (35Markovitz A. Sutherland I.W. Surface Carbohydrates of the Prokaryotic Cell. 1. Academic Press, New York1977: 415-462Google Scholar). When grown at low temperature in defined media, the ugd mutant is not mucoid presumably because it is unable to synthesize colanic acid. 2M. M. S. M. Wösten and E. A. Groisman, unpublished results. On the other hand, pmrA mutants are mucoid,2implying that the ugd gene can be expressed independently of the PmrA protein. This suggests that the PmrA protein regulates transcription of the ugd gene only indirectly and that a different regulator is likely to bind and activate transcription from the ugd promoter. Thus, the ugd gene defines a new class of PhoP/PhoQ-activated genes, a class that can be transcriptionally induced by at least three signals as follows: growth in low magnesium (in a process that requires both the PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB two-component systems), growth in mild acid media (in a process that requires PmrA/PmrB but that is independent of PhoP/PhoQ), and a yet undefined condition (in a process that is independent of both PmrA/PmrB and PhoP/PhoQ). Finally, we analyzed the genome of E. coli K-12 for the presence of PmrA-binding sites and found such sequences in front of the pmrC homologue yjdB, where it covers the inner part of a 14-bp inverted repeat, and in the intergenic region of the homologues of the pbgPE and pmrG genes. The conservation of the binding sites in E. coli and Salmonella is consistent with the high degree of sequence identity that exists between the Salmonella PmrA protein and its homologue in E. coli K-12 BasR (90% at the amino acid level) (36Blattner F.R. Plunkett I., G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5989) Google Scholar) and suggests that transcription activation of PmrA-regulated genes will be highly similar in these enteric species."

The results show overall consistency among several independent measurement systems, particularly for northern hemisphere midlatitudes where most balloon and ground-based measurements are made. Combined trend estimates over these latitudes for the period 1979–96 show statistically significant negative trends at all altitudes between 10 and 45 km, with two local extremes: −7.4 ± 2.0% per decade at 40 km and −7.3 ± 4.6% per decade at 15 km altitude. There is a strong seasonal variation in trends over northern midlatitudes in the altitude range of 10 to 18 km, with the largest ozone loss during winter and spring. The profile trends are in quantitative agreement with independently measured trends in column ozone, the amount of ozone in a column above the surface. The vertical profiles of ozone trends provide a fingerprint for the mechanisms of ozone depletion over the last two decades."

SLIM1 contains an N-terminal single zinc finger followed by four LIM domains. SLIMMER is identical to SLIM1 over the first three LIM domains but contains a novel C-terminal 96 amino acids with three potential bipartite nuclear localization signals, a putative nuclear export sequence, and 27 amino acids identical to the RBP-J binding region of KyoT2, a murine isoform of SLIM1. SLIM1 localized to the cytosol of Sol8 myoblasts and myotubes. SLIMMER was detected in the nucleus of myoblasts and, following differentiation into myotubes, was exclusively cytosolic. Recombinant green fluorescent protein-SLIM1 localized to the cytoplasm and associated with focal adhesions and actin filaments in COS-7 cells, while green fluorescent protein-SLIMMER was predominantly nuclear. SLIMMER truncation mutants revealed that the first nuclear localization signal mediates nuclear localization. The addition of the proposed nuclear export sequence decreased the level of exclusively nuclear expression and increased cytosolic SLIMMER expression in COS-7 cells. The leucine-rich nuclear export signal was required for the export of SLIMMER from the nucleus of myoblasts to the cytoplasm of myotubes. Collectively, these results suggest distinct roles for SLIM1 and SLIMMER in focal adhesions and nuclear-cytoplasmic communication.

Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1990; 344: 876-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The LIM domain contains 50–60 amino acids, with the consensus sequence (C X2C X17–19H X2C)X2(C X2C X16–20C X2(H/D/C)). The conserved cysteine and histidine residues form two zinc-binding pockets stabilizing the tertiary structure of the protein (6Michelsen J.W. Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4404-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 7Perez-Alvarado G.C. Miles C. Michelsen J.W. Louis H.A. Winge D.R. Beckerle M.C. Summers M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Despite their structural resemblance to GATA-1 zinc fingers, there is no evidence that LIM domains bind DNA directly. Instead, an increasing number of studies implicate LIM domains in protein-protein interactions that regulate development, cellular differentiation, and the cytoskeleton (8Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 9Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that LIM proteins form a scaffold upon which the coordinated assembly of proteins occurs (8Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 10Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). No single LIM domain-binding motif has been identified. LIM domains can associate with other LIM domains to form homo- or heterodimers (8Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 11Feuerstein R. Wang X. Song D. Cooke N.E. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, LIM domains also bind tyrosine-containing motifs, PDZ domains, ankyrin repeats, and helix-loop-helix domains in proteins lacking LIM domains including tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases, cytoskeletal proteins, and transcription factors (12Wu R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). LIM proteins have been demonstrated in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. LIM homeodomain and LMO proteins are nuclear proteins, which regulate transcription by forming complexes with other transcription factors (2Curtiss J. Heilig J.S. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,10Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Members of the cysteine-rich protein family (CRP1,1 CRP2, and CRP3/MLP (muscle LIM protein), each expressed in different muscle cell types) have a joint localization in the nucleus and along the actin cytoskeleton, probably reflecting dual roles (9Arber S. Caroni P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, MLP interacts with the myogenic transcription factor MyoD to regulate transcription (17Kong Y. Flick M.J. Kudla A. Konieczny S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4750-4760Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The importance of MLP in regulating the cytoskeleton has been demonstrated in MLP knockout mice, which develop marked disruption of the cardiac cytoarchitecture, resulting in a dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure (18Arber S. Hunter J.J. Ross J. Hongo M. Sansig G. Borg J. Perriard J. Chien K.R. Caroni P. Cell. 1997; 88: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In the cytoskeleton, CRP interacts with the focal adhesion-associated LIM protein zyxin, via a LIM-LIM interaction (8Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). CRP and zyxin also bind the actin-binding protein α-actinin (19Pomies P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These overlapping CRP-zyxin-α-actinin interactions may either stabilize or regulate the cytoskeleton. It has recently been proposed that zyxin, which contains a nuclear export sequence, shuttles between focal adhesions and the nucleus (21Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The LIM protein, paxillin, also associates with focal adhesions, and this association is mediated via its LIM domains (22Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). LIM2 and LIM3 of paxillin are serine-phosphorylated by an associated serine/threonine kinase, and this phosphorylation increases the association of paxillin with focal adhesions (23Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Three homologous skeletal muscle LIM proteins designated SLIM1, SLIM2, and SLIM3 have been identified by partial cDNA cloning and sequence data base analyses (24Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Charleston B. Pell J.M. Loughna P.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. A Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each SLIM contains an N-terminal zinc finger followed by four complete LIM domains and no other signaling or DNA binding motifs. SLIM1 has also been cloned from a human heart library, designated “Four and a Half LIM protein 1,” and the gene has been localized to chromosome Xq27 (26Lee S.M.Y. Tsui S.K.W. Chan K.K. Garci-Barcelo M. Waye M.M. Y Fung K.P. Liew C.C. Lee C.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 16: 163-170Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). An alternatively spliced murine isoform of SLIM1, called KyoT2, has recently been identified as a binding partner of the DNA-binding protein, RBP-J (27Taniguchi Y. Furukawa T. Tun T. Han H. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). KyoT2 comprises the N-terminal two and a half LIM domains of SLIM1 followed by 27 novel C-terminal amino acids. These 27 C-terminal amino acids mediate binding to RBP-J, displacing RBP-J from DNA and thereby inhibiting transcription. SLIM1 does not bind RBP-J. We report here the cloning and characterization of a novel alternatively spliced human isoform of SLIM1, designated SLIMMER (for SLIM1 with extra regions). We demonstrate that SLIM1 is localized at focal adhesions, while SLIMMER, with functional nuclear import and export sequences, localizes to the nucleus of myoblasts and the cytoplasm of myotubes. The discrete subcellular locations of the two isoforms suggest distinct roles in the cytoskeleton and nuclear-cytoplasmic communication. [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]dATP, and [35S]methionine were from NEN Life Science Products. Restriction and DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs or Promega. The human bone marrow λgt11 cDNA library and human multitissue Northern blot were purchased fromCLONTECH. pCR 2.1 cloning vector was from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Bresatec, Australia. Thermosequenase II kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Synthetic peptides were from Chiron Mimotopes (Melbourne, Australia). Sol8 and COS-7 cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). A human bone marrow cDNA library (1 × 106 recombinants) was screened using a synthetic oligonucleotide “GCACCATGGCGGGGAAG” derived from the 5-prime end of the human 43-kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (28De Smedt F. Verjans B. Mailleux P. Erneux C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was labeled with γ-32P using polynucleotide kinase and hybridized at 42 °C using standard conditions (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified and plaque-purified. The cDNA from positive clones were amplified by PCR using λ phage primers and subcloned into the pCR 2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Two cDNA clones 1.9 and 2.1 kb were completely sequenced on both strands using standard dideoxynucleotide sequencing procedures and an “oligo-walk” strategy (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed using DNASIS version 7.0 (Hitachi) software and ANGIS and BLAST-EST programs. The probe used was the 200-base pair (bp) insert of SLIMMER (nucleotides 784–968), which was obtained by Sma I/Tth 111I restriction digestion of the 2.1-kb cDNA encoding SLIMMER. DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Prime-a-gene, Promega) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C to a commercial human multitissue mRNA membrane and washed using standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The membrane was allowed to decay and subsequently rehybridized to an actin probe. The 1.9- and 2.1-kb cDNAs were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pSVTf (30Madison E.L. Bird P.I Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 179-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The two constructs were linearized by restriction enzyme digestion, and using the TNT Coupled Wheatgerm Extract systems (Promega) translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translation products were analyzed by 12.5% sodium-dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by fluorography. Antipeptide antibodies were generated to synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or diptheria toxoid. The first peptide represented amino acids 261–272 (NKRFVFHQEQVY) unique to LIM4 of SLIM1. The second peptide represented amino acids 231–246 (KRTVSRVSHPVSKARK), unique to the insert sequence of SLIMMER. Each conjugated peptide was injected intramuscularly into two New Zealand White rabbits. Affinity-purified anti-peptide antibodies were obtained by chromatography of preimmune or immune sera on specific peptide coupled to thiopropyl-Sepharose resin. Following extensive washing, specific antibodies were eluted from the column with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting utilized affinity-purified antipeptide serum. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted to 1:10,000. Immunoblots were developed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human skeletal muscle was obtained from tissue routinely divided at elective hip surgery (Box Hill Hospital, Medical Ethics Approval). Muscle was weighed and suspended five times (v/w) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μmleupeptin, and 0.83 mm benzamidine. Lysates were homogenized on ice immediately for 3 × 20 s (LABSONIC 1510), and a sample of total cell lysate was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The Sol8 mouse skeletal muscle cell line (31Daubas P. Klarsfeld A. Garner I. Pinset C. Cox R. Buckingham M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1251-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 20% fetal bovine serum on gelatin-coated plates. Cells were replated before they reached 50% confluence. For indirect immunofluorescence, myoblasts were grown on glass coverslips treated with 0.3% bovine collagen and 0.1% growth factor reduced Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products) and incubated overnight in DMEM plus 20% fetal bovine serum. For Sol8 myotubes, myoblasts were grown to 70% confluence on collagen-Matrigel-treated coverslips and induced to differentiate and fuse in DMEM plus 5% horse serum for 72 h. Cells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed and permeabilized for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% formaldehyde and 2% Triton X-100. Preimmune or affinity-purified anti-SLIM1 or anti-SLIMMER sera were added. The cells were washed and then placed in 1:400 FITC-anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Silenus). Co-localization with propidium iodide was performed by pretreatment with RNase A (10 mg/ml) for 2 h, followed by the addition of propidium iodide (0.2 mg/ml) for 10 min. The cells were visualized using both fluorescence and confocal microscopy. The cDNAs encoding the open reading frames of SLIM1, SLIMMER, and truncated constructs were amplified by PCR and cloned in frame into the Xba site of the pCGN vector, thereby adding an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag (Dr. T Tiganis, St. Vincent's Medical Institute). The constructs were transiently transfected into Sol8 myoblasts using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following transfection, the myoblasts were grown in DMEM plus 20% fetal calf serum for 24 h or were induced to differentiate into myotubes as described above. The transfected myoblasts or myotubes were fixed, and the expression of HA-tagged protein was detected by a monoclonal anti-HA antibody diluted 1:50 (AMRAD). The cDNAs encoding the open reading frames of SLIM1, SLIMMER, or truncated constructs were amplified by PCR and cloned in frame into the Eco RI restriction enzyme site of the expression vector pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). The nucleotide sequence of all GFP constructs was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. All constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, grown in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using a DEAE-dextran technique and grown for 2 days (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as outlined for Sol8 cells. Co-localization was performed using 50 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or 1:500 tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). The anti-paxillin antibody was detected with a secondary Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Transfected cells were visualized by fluorescent or confocal microscopy. To confirm the synthesis of the recombinant GFP proteins, transfected COS-7 cells were lysed by adding 500 μl of 30 mm Tris, pH 7, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton to each plate for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were scraped off and pelleted in a microcentrifuge tube. The protein concentrations of lysates were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Lysates from each transfection were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies to green fluorescent protein, kindly provided by Dr. Pam Silver. Two cDNAs encoding isoforms of SLIM1 were incidentally isolated during attempts to clone the 43-kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase) (28De Smedt F. Verjans B. Mailleux P. Erneux C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Laxminarayan K.M. Chan B.K. Tetaz T. Bird P.I. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17305-17310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide representing nucleotides 95–111 of the Type I 5-phosphatase (28De Smedt F. Verjans B. Mailleux P. Erneux C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number X77567) was used to screen 1 × 106plaques of a λgt11 human bone marrow library. Two positive clones (1.9 and 2.1 kb) were identified, purified, and subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector. DNA sequencing of each clone revealed that they were identical, apart from a 200-bp insert present in the 2.1-kb cDNA (Fig. 1 A). There was no homology in either clone to the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase, except for 16 out of 17 nucleotides from position 80 to 96, in both the 1.9- and 2.1-kb cDNA, which were identical to the oligonucleotide used to screen the library. Sequence analysis revealed that the 1.9-kb cDNA is 99% identical to that of SLIM1 (25Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. A Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which was derived by analysis of 36 overlapping sequences from a skeletal muscle cDNA library and various sequence data bases, except that our cDNA lacks 400 bp of the 3′-untranslated region. The 1.9-kb clone is 100% identical to the “Four and a Half LIM protein 1” cloned from a human heart library (26Lee S.M.Y. Tsui S.K.W. Chan K.K. Garci-Barcelo M. Waye M.M. Y Fung K.P. Liew C.C. Lee C.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 16: 163-170Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Translation of the cDNA sequence reveals that SLIM1 is composed almost entirely of four LIM domains preceded by a single N-terminal zinc finger, with a predicted unmodified molecular mass of 32 kDa. Each LIM domain is separated by eight intervening amino acids, and there are no other known motifs, in particular homeodomain, or glycine-rich sequences (Fig. 1 A). A comparison of SLIM1 with various protein sequence data bases reveals that it shows 47% overall identity with DRAL (SLIM3), a 32-kDa muscle protein that is down-regulated in rhabdomyosarcomas (33Genini M. Schwalbe P. Scholl F.A. Remppis A. Mattei M-G. Schafer B.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and 45% with SLIM2 (25Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. A Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 2.1-kb cDNA showed that it was identical to SLIM1 except for a 200-bp insert beginning at nucleotide 775. This insertion causes a shift in the reading frame such that it now terminates at nucleotide 1054, instead of 923 (Fig. 1, A and B). Translation of the open reading frame predicts a protein of 323 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 34 kDa. Examination of various sequence data bases showed that the 2.1-kb isoform has not been previously described; therefore, we have designated this new isoform SLIMMER, for “SLIM1 with extra regions” (GenBankTM accession number AF063002). This acronym is also appropriate because, although larger in molecular mass, SLIMMER contains one less LIM domain than SLIM1. The SLIMMER cDNA encodes an N-terminal zinc finger followed by three LIM domains identical to SLIM1; however, the final 93 amino acids are different. These novel C-terminal 93 amino acids do not encode a fourth LIM domain but instead contain three overlapping sequences that each conform to a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) amino acid sequence (34Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwell C Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 35Kleinschmidt J.A. Seiter A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Gorlich D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and C). Immediately following the NLS, there is a leucine-rich sequence, consistent with a nuclear export sequence (NES) (37Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 38Wen W. Meinkoth J. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 39Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). The 27 C-terminal amino acids of SLIMMER are identical to the C-terminal amino acids described in KyoT2, a murine isoform of SLIM1 (Fig. 1, A and B). KyoT2 was identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen for binding partners of RBP-J, a DNA-binding protein (27Taniguchi Y. Furukawa T. Tun T. Han H. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 644-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). KyoT2 comprises the first two LIM domains of SLIM1 followed by 27 amino acids, not present in SLIM1 but present in SLIMMER, that mediate binding to RBP-J (Fig.1 A). A previous study by Morgan et al. (24Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Charleston B. Pell J.M. Loughna P.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) has shown very high levels of SLIM1 mRNA in skeletal muscle and only low levels in other sheep tissues tested. We demonstrated that human SLIM1 mRNA is highly expressed in skeletal muscle, with intermediate expression in heart and low level expression in prostate, colon, testis, ovary, small intestine, and placenta, a much wider expression than previously described (results not shown). However, the SLIM1 cDNA used as a probe in these studies probably detects both SLIM1 and SLIMMER transcripts. In order to determine whether SLIM1 and SLIMMER mRNAs are expressed in the same or different tissues, we performed a Northern blot analysis using a SLIMMER-specific probe, containing nucleotides 784–968 of the SLIMMER insert cDNA. High level expression of a 2.4-kb transcript was seen in skeletal muscle, with lower level expression in the heart, colon, prostate, and small intestine (Fig.2). In addition, low level expression of a 4.4-kb transcript, possibly a pre-mRNA, was also observed in skeletal muscle and colon. In control studies, the Northern blot was reprobed with an actin probe, and equal loading of mRNA from each tissue was confirmed (results not shown). To confirm the molecular mass of the proteins predicted by the 1.9- and 2.1-kb cDNAs, the respective cDNAs were translated using a wheat germ expression system in the presence of [35S]methionine. Translation of the 2.1-kb SLIMMER cDNA resulted in a product that migrated as a 34-kDa polypeptide on reduced SDS-PAGE, while the 1.9-kb SLIM1 mRNA gave rise to a 32-kDa polypeptide, consistent with the respective molecular masses predicted by the cloning studies (Fig.3). To confirm the presence of the two SLIM1 protein isoforms in skeletal muscle, skeletal muscle lysates were immunoblotted with affinity-purified antipeptide antibody against either amino acids 261–272, specific to LIM4 of SLIM1 (anti-SLIM1), or amino acids 231–246, unique to SLIMMER (anti-SLIMMER) (Fig. 1 A). Western blot analysis of human skeletal muscle, using the anti-SLIMMER antibody demonstrated a 34-kDa polypeptide, while the anti-SLIM1 antibody detected a 32-kDa polypeptide, consistent with their respective predicted molecular mass (Fig.4). Given the high expression of both SLIM1 and SLIMMER in skeletal muscle upon Northern analysis, we investigated the intracellular distribution of SLIM1 and SLIMMER in the Sol8 skeletal muscle cell line, in both undifferentiated myoblasts and differentiated myotubes. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed using preimmune, affinity-purified anti-SLIM1, or anti-SLIMMER antiserum. In myoblasts, the anti-SLIM1 antibody detected diffuse cytoplasmic staining with low level nuclear expression (Fig.5 A). In multinucleate differentiated myotubes, SLIM1 was expressed exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). The anti-SLIMMER antibody detected prominent nuclear staining in myoblasts with faint cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 5 C). The nuclear staining of SLIMMER in myoblasts was consistently much more prominent, and the cytoplasmic expression was much less than that observed using the SLIM1-specific antibody. In differentiated myotubes, SLIMMER was no longer detected in the nucleus but was localized exclusively in the cytosol (Fig. 5 D). Upon serum deprivation-induced differentiation of myoblasts, two populations of cells, both myoblasts and myotubes, are observed (40Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this dual population, SLIMMER was observed in the nucleus of myoblasts and cytoplasm of myotubes (5E). The preimmune serum showed no specific staining (Fig. 5 F). Collectively, these studies implicate dual roles for SLIMMER in the nucleus of undifferentiated myoblasts and the cytoplasm of differentiated myotubes and indicate that SLIMMER may translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The distinct intracellular localization of SLIM1 and SLIMMER in muscle cells was confirmed by transiently expressing recombinant HA-SLIM1 and HA-SLIMMER in Sol8 myoblasts and differentiated into myotubes. HA-SLIM1 was expressed in the cytoplasm of both myoblasts and myotubes (Fig.6, A and B). In contrast, HA-SLIMMER was predominantly localized to the nucleus in myoblasts with faint cytoplasmic staining and exclusively in the cytoplasm of myotubes (Fig. 6, C and D). To identify the structural motifs mediating the localization of SLIMMER in the nucleus and export to the cytoplasm, SLIM1, SLIMMER, and various C-terminal truncation mutants were fused in frame with GFP and expressed transiently in COS-7 cells (Fig.1 A). Transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies to GFP to determine the stability of the recombinant proteins. Transfected GFP-SLIM1 and GFP-SLIMMER migrated at t"
https://openalex.org/W2157329863,"Because integrin-mediated signals are transferred through a physical architecture and synergistic biochemical network whose properties are not well defined, quantitative relationships between extracellular integrin-ligand binding events and key intracellular responses are poorly understood. We begin to address this by quantifying integrin-mediated FAK and ERK2 responses in CHO cells for varied α5β1 expression level and substratum fibronectin density. Plating cells on fibronectin-coated surfaces initiated a transient, biphasic ERK2 response, the magnitude and kinetics of which depended on integrin-ligand binding properties. Whereas ERK2 activity initially increased with a rate proportional to integrin-ligand bond number for low fibronectin density, the desensitization rate was independent of integrin and fibronectin amount but proportional to the ERK2 activity level with an exponential decay constant of 0.3 (± 0.08) min−1. Unlike the ERK2 activation time course, FAK phosphorylation followed a superficially disparate time course. However, analysis of the early kinetics of the two signals revealed them to be correlated. The initial rates of FAK and ERK2 signal generation exhibited similar dependence on fibronectin surface density, with both rates monotonically increasing with fibronectin amount until saturating at high fibronectin density. Because of this similar initial rate dependence on integrin-ligand bond formation, the disparity in their time courses is attributed to differences in feedback regulation of these signals. Whereas FAK phosphorylation increased to a steady-state level as new integrin-ligand bond formation continued during cell spreading, ERK2 activity was decoupled from the integrin-ligand stimulus and decayed back to a basal level. Accordingly, we propose different functional metrics for representing these two disparate dynamic signals: the steady-state tyrosine phosphorylation level for FAK and the integral of the pulse response for ERK2. These measures of FAK and ERK2 activity were found to correlate with short term cell-substratum adhesivity, indicating that signaling via FAK and ERK2 is proportional to the number of integrin-fibronectin bonds.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Altered cell behavior due to aberrant regulation of these signals results in pathologies, such as cancer, in which loss of integrin signaling-based control of cell cycle progression leads to anchorage-independent cell growth and tumor formation (6Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Because of these significant and wide-ranging regulatory roles, modulating integrin-mediated signals may provide powerful targets for disease therapy. Furthermore, since integrins interface cells to biomaterials, biomimetic surfaces may be designed to instigate appropriate integrin-mediated signals to elicit desired cell behavior on these surfaces. However, several issues must be addressed before rational design can be undertaken for controlled manipulation of these signals for such applications. The first such issue derives from the complexity of the multiple pathways and numerous signaling molecules that connect the extracellular stimulus to intracellular signals. These signals emanate from focal adhesion complexes, which are formed upon aggregation of ligand-bound integrins and are composed of intracellular and transmembrane proteins held together by noncovalent intermolecular associations (7Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In addition to the poorly characterized physical architecture of these complexes and the mechanisms of its assembly, biophysical phenomena, such as diffusion to and from the plasma membrane and molecular crowding in multiprotein complexes, could inhibit the progress of these pathways (8Bray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 59-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the downstream non-membrane-associated signaling events are highly interconnected, and clarification of their operational synergy is only beginning to emerge. Because of the complexity within each hierarchy of events leading to integrin signals (9Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama Y. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), it is not intuitively apparent how the extracellular ligand binding event quantitatively relates to intracellular signaling responses. This fundamental relationship is essential to a better understanding of the cumulative performance of the synergistic mechanisms underlying integrin-mediated signaling. In this study, we begin to address this by quantifying FAK phosphorylation and ERK2 activation in response to manipulating α5β1 integrin interaction with its ligand, Fn. The focus on FAK and ERK2 is based not only on their significance in regulating multiple cell functions (10Guan J.-L. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 16Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shen Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J.

Therefore, in addition to relating integrin-ligand binding to these signals in a dose-response signaling study, we compare the dynamic portions of FAK and ERK2 signals to determine whether the kinetics are reflective of FAK phosphorylation being upstream of ERK2 activation. Furthermore, by undertaking this kinetic analysis, we aim to develop a rigorous methodology for quantitatively comparing signals that are often-observed to be dynamic and diverse. For example, MAPK activity was measured to be a transient response spanning 60 min in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts but was long-lived in NIH3T3 cells, maintaining a nonbasal steady-state level for up to 180 min (20Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Within the same cell system, altering the form of stimulation produced a transient versus sustained MAPK response (21Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In addition, even for a fixed stimulation in the same cell type, FAK phosphorylation and ERK2 activity followed disparate time courses (22Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Given this diversity in signaling responses, it is essential to determine what properties of these signals can be used to ascertain latent correlations and to gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms, both positive and negative, affecting these signals. In our system, analysis of the dynamics of the ERK2 and FAK response revealed that (a) FAK and ERK2 activation by integrin/Fn binding may involve pathways having some parallel character; (b) the initial rate of signaling via ERK2 is proportional to integrin-ligand bond number; (c) ERK2 deactivation is driven by feedback mechanisms operating at a rate determined by the amount of active ERK2 and with a rate constant independent of integrin/Fn binding; (d) despite the superficial disparity in the FAK and ERK2 time courses, the initial rates of both responses have a similar dependence on Fn density; and (e) the disparity stems from different desensitization mechanisms regulating FAK and ERK2. Finally, metrics proposed for representing these dynamic signals were shown to quantitatively correlate to their common stimulus of integrin/ligand binding and cell adhesion. Human plasma Fn and PL was obtained from Sigma. The human α5 cDNA (23Argraves W.S. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K. Pierschbacher M. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and the 6F4 anti-human α5 antibody were gifts from Dr. Louis Reichardt (University of California, San Fransisco, CA) and Dr. Ralph Isberg (Tufts University), respectively. The sc-154 anti-ERK2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The E10 monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs) was used to detect phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase, and total ERK1/2 amounts were probed with the pan-ERK antibody (Transduction Laboratories). The sc-558 anti-FAK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) and the 2A7 monoclonal anti-FAK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) were used for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively. CHO-B2 cells transfected with human α5 integrin subunit as described previously (24Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar) were maintained under selection with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 4 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% (v/v) 100× nonessential amino acids. CHO cells expressing human α5 integrin were divided into subpopulations based on their α5β1 integrin expression levels using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (24Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). Sorted cells were grown and frozen for later use. Fn or PL diluted in PBS was incubated overnight at 4oC in Nunc tissue culture-treated plastic dishes. The dishes were then washed twice with cold PBS and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 mg/ml sterile-filtered, heat-inactivated (70oC, 1 h) bovine serum albumin in PBS. Prior to use, the dishes were washed twice with warm PBS. Fn coating density was quantified using Fn labeled with125I using the manufacturer's protocol for Iodobeads (Pierce). Radioisotope-labeled Fn was coated onto Nunc tissue culture plastic as described above, including the bovine serum albumin block and the final two warm PBS washes. The Fn remaining on the dish was removed using a series of incubations and washes with 1 mNaOH and 10× trypsin (Sigma). Fluid from each wash and strip incubation was collected, and the amount of radioactivity was measured with a gamma counter (Packard). Cells were serum-starved on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18 h in serum-free media containing 25 mmHepes-based Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 500 μg/ml Geneticin, 4 mml-glutamine, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 1% (v/v) 100× nonessential amino acids, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cells were suspended using versene (Life Technologies, Inc.) and resuspended in serum-free medium to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. They were maintained in suspension for 1 h to bring adhesion-related signals to a basal level. Serum-starved cells were plated onto Fn-coated 60-mm dishes and were incubated at 37oC. At desired times, they were washed once with cold PBS and lysed by adding cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μmsodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF. The lysis buffer for FAK studies was more stringent, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. Cells were scraped into the buffer and allowed to lyse for approximately 15 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. Micro-BCA protein determination (Pierce) was used to determine total protein concentration. ERK2 kinase activity was measured using a sensitive in vitro assay performed in a 96-well format as described previously (25Asthagiri A.R. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, anti-ERK2 antibody was coated on the surface of Reacti-BindTM protein A-coated wells (Pierce) by incubating wells with 10 μg/ml sc-154 antibody overnight at 4oC. After the wells were washed, 25 μg of cell lysate was incubated for 3 h at 4oC. To measure background, an extra well was incubated with just lysis buffer and was carried through the assay in the same manner as other samples. After washing, each well was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 15 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate (pH 7.3), 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol. To each well, 40 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) was added. The in vitro reaction was initiated by adding 25 μm ATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). After 30 min of agitation at 37 °C, reactions were quenched with 75 mm phosphoric acid. The quenched reaction contents were filtered through a 96-well phosphocellulose filter plate using the Millipore Multiscreen® system (Millipore). After washes,32P label on each filter paper was quantified using CytoScintTM (ICN Biomedicals) scintillation fluid and RackBeta (Wallac) scintillation counter. 32P measurements were adjusted by subtracting the radioactivity associated with the background sample. For determining dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels, whole cell lysates (15 μg) were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto PVDF membrane. Blots were probed using 1:5000 dilution of E10 anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody. After analyzing the blot, it was stripped and reprobed for total ERK1/2 levels using 1:5000 dilution of pan-ERK antibody. FAK was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of cell lysate using ∼2 μg of 2A7 anti-FAK antibody coated on anti-mouse IgG beads (Sigma). After four washes, 30 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer was added to the immunoprecipitate, and the sample was boiled for 5 min. The sample was resolved under 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed for phosphotyrosine using 1:2500 dilution of RC20H and the SuperSignal® Ultra substrate (Pierce). After analyzing the blot, it was stripped by incubating in 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C for 30 min and probed for total FAK using 1:100 dilution of sc-558 antibody. Bands were visualized with the Molecular Imager® system (Bio-Rad), and further analysis and quantification were performed with the Multi-Analyst® software (Bio-Rad). FAK phosphorylation levels were normalized to the amount of total FAK recovered from each immunoprecipitate. Nunc tissue culture-treated 96-well plates were coated with varying amounts of Fn (5 wells for each Fn amount). A set of negative-control wells with no Fn was also prepared. A positive-control plate coated with 20 μg/ml PL was prepared to support attachment of all plated cells. Serum-starved cells were plated in these wells and allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 10 min. During the next 10 min, cells continued to adhere to the surface while the plate was being prepared for centrifugation. In total, cells were given 20 min to form their attachments to the surface. The wells were prepared for centrifugation by filling them completely with serum-free medium and sealing them. The plates containing both the Fn-coated and negative-control wells were inverted and centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature. The positive-control plate was inverted but not centrifuged. After centrifugation, the seals were removed, and the contents of all wells were aspirated. While the plates were kept on ice, cells were lysed for 5 min in 20 μl of cold 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. In the meantime, lactate dehydrogenase reagent (Sigma) was prepared by mixing 10 parts reagent A to 0.4 parts reagent B. Lactate dehydrogenase reagent was added to each well and the mixture was transferred to an UV Spectra plate (Corning Costar). The absorption at 340 nm (A340) was read for 3 min, every 12 s on a Spectramax (Molecular Dynamics). The A340readings for the negative-control wells were treated as background and were subtracted from the other measurements. The rate of A340 decrease is proportional to the number of cells in each well. The fraction of cells detached due to centrifugation was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of the rate of A340 decrease in the wells that were centrifuged to the rate of A340 decrease in the positive-control well. From this data, the mean detachment force required to detach 50% of the cells was calculated. Serum-starved CHO cells were plated in microtiter wells in serum-free medium with 1 mm RGD, 1 mm RGE, or no peptide. After allowing cells to adhere and spread for 1 h, a picture was taken using a Nikon camera attached to a phase-contrast microscope. Then, the plate was pulsed four times at 800 rpm on a plate shaker to dislodge weakly adhered cells. After a single wash with PBS, cell number was quantified using the lactate dehydrogenase assay as described above. To quantitatively relate integrin-ligand binding to integrin-mediated signaling, α5β1integrin-Fn binding was manipulated by altering both α5β1 integrin expression level and Fn coating density. Two CHO cell populations with relative mean α5β1 integrin expression levels of 1 and 1.7 were obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of a CHO-B2 cell line that was transfected with cDNA encoding the human α5 integrin subunit (Fig. 1). The amount of adsorbed Fn was varied by incubating tissue culture plastic with solutions of different fibronectin concentration. Radioisotope-labeled Fn was used to directly measure the amount of Fn coated on the surface (Fig. 2). The adsorption isotherm fit a curve described by the Langmuir model for single species adsorption to a single site on the substratum, and maximum coverage was predicted to be 2.2 (± 0.3) × 1010 molecules/mm2 or 16 (± 2.2) ng/mm2, assuming a molecular mass of 450 kDa. This value is in agreement with the theoretically predicted saturation density of 3.2 × 1010 molecules/mm2 from a close-packing model that assumes cylindrical dimensions of length 60 nm and base diameter 6 nm for the Fn molecule (26DiMilla P.A. Albelda S.M. Quinn J.A. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1992; 153: 212-225Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Half-maximal adsorption occurred at a coating concentration of 83 (± 20) μg/ml or 180 (± 43) nm. We used coating concentrations in the range of 0.1–10 μg/ml yielding surface Fn densities of 5.3–310 × 107 molecules/mm2. Adsorption was not a linear function of coating concentration as a 100-fold increase in coating concentration yielded only a 60-fold increase in surface density, indicating the importance of directly measuring levels of adsorbed Fn. Because our focus was to quantify signaling induced specifically by α5β1 integrin-Fn interactions, cells were stimulated by plating on Fn-coated surfaces under serum-free conditions to avoid additive signaling effects from growth factors and other ECM proteins present in serum. Signaling synergy between growth factor receptors and integrins is well documented and would thwart our ability to make clear conclusions about signaling responses caused solely by the binding of α5β1 integrin to Fn (27Lin T.H. Chen Q. Howe A. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8849-8852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 28Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J.

In order to study the full effect of changing integrin-ligand binding properties, the entire time course of the ERK2 signal was measured at each condition. The challenge of such a study is that the number of parameters was enlarged to include not only two α5β1 integrin expression levels and five Fn amounts, but also several time points. In total, this involved ERK2 activity measurement of ∼60 samples per trial. To handle such a large quantity of samples, we developed and utilized a modified microtiter ERK2 activity assay that allowed for convenient and concurrent processing of multiple samples (25Asthagiri A.R. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Using this method, the measured time course of ERK2 activity revealed quantitative variations in response to changes in integrin-ligand binding properties (Fig.3, A and B). This observed ERK2 response was initiated specifically by cell adhesion to Fn, as plating cells on PL failed to induce a response (Fig.3 C). For each integrin expression level, a change in Fn density altered both the magnitude and kinetics of the ERK2 response. When Fn amount was increased, ERK2 activity reached a higher peak level within a shorter time. For example, for the 1× α5β1expression level, an increase in Fn coating density from 5 × 107/mm2 to 310 × 107/mm2 increased the peak activity level approximately 5-fold and reduced the time required to reach this peak from ∼10 to ∼5 min. The initial rate of ERK2 activation affects both the magnitude of the peak and the time required to reach this peak. We calculated this initial ERK2 activation rate as the slope of the time course between the 0- and 5-min time points. Higher initial rates of ERK2 activation were achieved by an increase in not only ligand density but also integrin expression. Normalizing the initial rate to integrin expression collapses the rate data for the two integrin expression levels onto a single curve, indicating that the initial rate of ERK2 activation is directly proportional to integrin amount (Fig. 4). At low Fn density, this normalized rate was also proportional to Fn amount as shown by a linear curve fit, revealing that the rate of ERK2 activation is simply proportional to the product of the Fn and integrin amount. At high Fn density, the initial rate of ERK2 activation saturated but was still proportional to integrin amount. This shows that the intracellular activation steps performed at a higher rate when more integrin was provided for binding to Fn. Regardless of the peak level attained, α5β1integrin-mediated ERK2 activation decays to a basal level by 20 min (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that the rate of ERK2 desensitization is proportional to ERK2 activity, which was confirmed by fitting an exponential decay curve to this portion of the ERK2 activity time course. Calculated decay constants for each Fn coating density and integrin expression level fluctuated around a mean value of 0.3 (± 0.08) min−1 and showed no significant dependence on integrin-ligand binding properties (TableI).Table IERK2 deactivation is a first-order process with respect to ERK2 activity levelα5β1 integrin expressionFibronectin densityDecay constant107/mm2min−11×50.20 (0.07)130.17 (0.02)250.39 (0.1)500.26 (0.01)3100.39 (0.06)1.7×50.25 (0.03)130.31 (0.11)250.38 (0.07)500.31 (0.06)3100.37 (0.17)Average value0.30 (0.08)For each integrin expression level and fibronectin coating density, the desensitization portion of the ERK2 activity time-course (time points 10, 15, and 20 min) was fit to an exponential decay, and the obtained r2 values ranged from 0.94 to 0.99. The decay constant fluctuated around a mean value of 0.30 (±0.08) min−1. Values in parentheses indicate the S.E. of the fit for the decay constant. Open table in a new tab For each integrin expression level and fibronectin coating density, the desensitization portion of the ERK2 activity time-course (time points 10, 15, and 20 min) was fit to an exponential decay, and the obtained r2 values ranged from 0.94 to 0.99. The decay constant fluctuated around a mean value of 0.30 (±0.08) min−1. Values in parentheses indicate the S.E. of the fit for the decay constant. The integral of the ERK2 time course was calculated as a single measure capable of representing both the magnitude and duration of the transient ERK2 signaling response. This integrated ERK2 activity was plotted as a function of Fn coating density for both integrin expression levels (Fig. 5 A). For a given integrin amount, the integrated ERK2 response increased with increasing Fn coating density, but saturated at high levels of Fn. This saturation was caused by a limitation in integrin-ligand binding because even at these higher saturating Fn densities, allowing more integrin-ligand bond formation by increasing integrin expression caused an increase in the integrated ERK2 response. In fact, when the integrated ERK2 response was normalized to integrin expression level, the normalized values for the 1× and 1.7× integrin expression levels were equal at every Fn coating density, indicating that the overall ERK2 response was directly proportional to integrin expression level (Fig.5 B). This direct proportionality indicates that when the binding limitations were relaxed by an increase in integrin amount, the intracellular signaling machinery was sufficiently in excess to promote a proportionally higher ERK2 signal. To see whether other integrin-mediated signals show similar dependence on integrin-ligand binding, FAK phosphorylation was measured as a function of time (Fig. 6 A). The time course of FAK phosphorylation significantly differed from the transient pulse response observed for ERK2. Upon exposure to a Fn-coated surface, FAK phosphorylation levels increased for the first 60 min, after which the response reached a suprabasa"

The affinity of CD8ααf for H-2Kb as measured by BIAcore revealed a ∼65 μm Kd, similar to that of CD8αβf. Consistent with this result, CD8ααf as well as CD8αβf blocked the effector function of N15 T cell receptor transgenic cytolytic T cells in a comparable, dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, both Lec3.2.8.1-produced and Chinese hamster ovary-produced CD8 homodimers and heterodimers were active in the inhibition assay. These results suggest that the Ig-like domains of CD8 molecules are themselves sufficient to block the requisite transmembrane CD8-pMHC interaction between cytolytic T lymphocytes and target cells. Moreover, given the similarities in co-receptor affinities for pMHC, the findings suggest that the greater efficiency of CD8αβ versus CD8αα co-receptor function on T cells is linked to differences within their membrane-bound stalk regions and/or intracellular segments. As recently shown for sCD8αα, the yield, purity and homogeneity of the deglycosylated protein resulting from this expression system is sufficient for crystallization and x-ray diffraction at atomic resolution.

CD8 is encoded by two distinct genes, termed CD8α (or Lyt 2) and CD8β (or Lyt 3) and expressed on the cell surface as a mixture of disulfide-linked CD8αα homodimers and CD8αβ heterodimers (2Littman D.R.

CD8α is a 34–37-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein whose extracellular segment contains a compact 122-amino acid (aa) N-terminal Ig-like domain and an extended 48-residue stalk region. A 28-aa cytoplasmic domain, including a cysteine motif responsible for interaction with p56lck, follows a canonical hydrophobic transmembrane anchor. CD8β is a 32-kDa glycoprotein sharing a similar architecture as CD8α but with <20% sequence identity (4Nakauchi H. Nolan G.P. Hsu C. Huang H.S. Kavathas P. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The stalk regions of the CD8α and β chains are quite different in length, with the CD8β stalk being 10–13 residues shorter than that of CD8α. Interestingly, the sialic acid content of O-linked glycans adducted to CD8β selectively decreases on thymocytes and activated T cells compared with that found on resting T cells. For its cell surface expression, CD8β requires association with the CD8α subunit, forming a CD8αβ heterodimer (6DiSanto J.P. Knowles R.W. Flomenberg N. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3465-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Gorman S.D. Sun Y.H. Zamoyska R. Parnes J.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3646-3653PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, CD8 genes are selectively expressed. Although CD8αβ heterodimers are predominantly found on the surface of TCRαβ T cells and thymocytes, CD8αα homodimers are additionally expressed on a subset of γδ T cells, intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes and natural killer cells (9Poussier P. Julius M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 521-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10von Boehmer H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 531-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it is safe to conclude that the two sets of CD8 co-receptors subserve distinct functions. The importance of CD8α in p56lck-linked T cell activation and signaling has been defined by multiple studies (11Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 12Letourneur F. Gabert J. Cosson P. Blanc D. Davoust J. Malissen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2339-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although unable to bind p56lck directly, other findings emphasize the contribution of CD8β to the efficacy of T cell recognition and its ability to broaden the range of antigen recognition (13Karaki S. Tanabe M. Nakauchi H. Takiguchi M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wheeler C.J. Hoegen von P. Parnes J.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence including our own show that CD8αβ is a more effective co-receptor than CD8αα in enhancing the sensitivity to peptide antigens as well as alloantigens recognized by TCRs (15Renard V. Romero P. Vivier E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2439-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.-C. Cell Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A role for the cytoplasmic portion of the CD8β chain in enhancing Lck kinase activity and promoting T cell development has been suggested (17Itano A. Cado D. Chan F.K. Robey E. Immunity. 1994; 1: 287-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Irie H.Y. Mong M.S. Itano A. Crooks M.E. Littman D.R. Burakoff S.J. Robey E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, at least for certain TCRs, the contribution of CD8αβ as a co-receptor may be due, in large part, to its extracellular components (16Witte T. Spoerl R. Chang H.-C. Cell Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody blocking studies, cellular adhesion assays, and direct molecular interaction studies as well as the recent studies of the crystal structures of the Ig domain of the human CD8αα (hCD8αα) dimer in complex with HLA-A2 and murine CD8αα (mCD8αα) in complex with H-2Kb have shown that the natural ligand of CD8α is the MHC class I molecule (19Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 20Kern P. Teng M.-K. Smolyar A.

These structures show unequivocally that one CD8αα dimer binds to one pMHC complex. Moreover, these findings are consistent with mutational analyses indicating that the α3 loop of the MHC class I (MHCI) molecule is the major CD8α binding component. Although the CD8αβ heterodimer is thought to bind to the MHCI α3 region as well, currently little is known about the specific molecular details. Given the importance of understanding the molecular interactions between the CD8 and MHC molecules, recombinant CD8 ectodomain fragments have been produced in a variety of systems (21Leahy D.J.

To overcome this limitation, we expressed the Ig-like domain of mCD8αα or the larger ectodomain fragment utilizing an engineered leucine zipper (LZ) system (29Chang H.-C. Bao Z.-Z. Yao Y. Tse A.G.D.

The CD8α Ig-like domain protein purified from Lec3.2.8.1 cells could be readily crystallized (20Kern P. Teng M.-K. Smolyar A. Liu J.-H. Liu J. Hussey R.E. Chang H.-C. Reinherz E.L. Wang J.-H.

The same strategy was used to produce the Ig-like domain of soluble recombinant murine CD8αβ protein as well as the entire extracellular segment. The binding of proteins to pMHC was examined by surface plasmon resonance as well as by functional inhibition studies of killing activity using N15 TCR (29Chang H.-C. Bao Z.-Z. Yao Y. Tse A.G.D.

As detailed below, we offer an explanation for the paradox as to why the transmembrane CD8αα versus CD8αβ co-receptors have such large differences in efficiency of facilitating TCR recognition (15Renard V.

Cell Immunol. 1999; 191: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and yet bind to class I MHC with comparable affinities. To promote the secretion of recombinant dimeric proteins in eukaryotic cells, the N-terminal extracellular segment of the mCD8α chain (residues 1–122) corresponding to the predicted Ig-like domain was fused via a flexible linker (aa residues 123–137) and a thrombin cleavage site (aa residues 129–132) to either Acid-p1 or Base-p1 leucine zipper fragments (31O'Shea E.K. Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 658-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) forming CD8α-A and CD8α-B, respectively (Fig. 1 A). For this purpose, a 5′-primer encoding aa 1–5 of CD8α and a 3′-primer encoding aa 115–122 plus 10 amino acids of flexible linker were used for polymerase chain reaction of the CD8α Ig-like domain from the pHbAPr-1 neo/Lyt2 cDNA clone (3Zamoyska R. Vollmer A.C. Sizer K.C. Liaw C.W. Parnes J.R. Cell. 1985; 43: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the pCR2 vector and sequenced. Subsequently, the error-free CD8α-Ig-like DNA fragment was then digested with Spe I and Bam HI and ligated with a Bam HI-Spe I DNA fragment encoding Acid-p1 or Base-p1 peptides to form the CD8α-A and CD8α-B, respectively. The DNA fragments were then subcloned into the Xba I site of the pEE14 vector (CellTech Ltd, Berkshire, UK) to form plasmids, pEE14 CD8α-A, and pEE14 CD8α-B, respectively. The CD8β construct pEE14 CD8β-A was generated in a similar fashion using a 5′-primer encoding residues 1–6 of murine CD8β, a 3′-primer encoding CD8β aa 109–115 and 10 amino acids of flexible linker and the CD8β Ig-like domain from pHbAPr-1 neo/Lyt3 cDNA clone (8Gorman S.D. Sun Y.H. Zamoyska R. Parnes J.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3646-3653PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The error-free CD8β Ig-like DNA fragment then was digested with Xba I and Bam HI and ligated with the Bam HI-Eco RI DNA fragment encoding Acid-p1 to form the CD8β-A. Subsequently, the DNA fragment was subcloned into the Xba I and Eco RI site of pEE14 vector to form plasmid, pEE14 CD8β-A. After sequence verification, the pEE14 CD8α-A plus pEE14 CD8α-B cDNAs or pEE14 CD8α-B plus pEE14 CD8β-A cDNAs were pairwise co-transfected into Lec3.2.8.1 cells (32Stanley P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) to produce murine CD8αα-LZ or CD8αβ-LZ proteins. To avoid cysteine mispairing and incorrect disulfide bond formation, a construct encoding the soluble full-length extracellular domain of CD8αα was terminated prior to cysteine residue 166. Moreover, cysteine 151 in the stalk region was mutated to a serine residue. A 5′ oligonucleotide primer corresponded to aa 1–5 of CD8α and a 3′-primer encoding aa 148–165 and 10 amino acids of flexible linker were used to polymerase chain reaction the CD8αf from the pHbAPr-1 neo/Lyt2 cDNA clone template. The DNA fragments generated were cloned into the pCR2 vector, and sequenced. The error-free CD8αf DNA fragment then was digested with Spe I and Bam HI and ligated to the Bam HI-Spe I DNA fragment encoding Acid-p1 or Base-p1 segments to form CD8αf-A and CD8αf-B, respectively. The DNA fragments were then subcloned into the Xba I site of pEE14 vector to generate the pEE14 CD8αf-A and pEE14 CD8αf-B plasmids. The construction of pEE14 CD8βf-A was generated in a similar fashion to pEE14 CD8αf-A, terminating immediately prior to cysteine 150. As with CD8α, the cysteine at aa 137 in the murine CD8β stalk region was mutated to serine. The DNA fragment of the CD8β full-length extracellular domain was generated by polymerase chain reaction from the pHbAPr-1 neo/Lyt3 cDNA clone as a template using the 5′-primer encoding aa 1–6 of CD8β and the 3′-primer encoding aa 135–149 as well as 10 aa of flexible linker. The error-free CD8βf-A DNA fragment then was digested with Xba I and Bam HI and ligated to the Bam HI-Eco RI DNA fragment encoding the Acid-p1 to form the CD8βf-A. Subsequently, the DNAs were subcloned into the Xba I and Eco RI sites of pEE14 vector to form the plasmid pEE14 CD8βf-A.

CD8 proteins that were employed for BIAcore studies were concentrated, sized on a 1.6 × 60 cm Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove any aggregates, and then concentrated and equilibrated in PBS. No CD8 aggregates were detected on reanalysis of the gel filtration-sized proteins. The protein concentration of CD8 samples was determined using a Bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin standards. All binding studies were performed with PBS/Tween 20 (0.005%) on a BIA1000 surface plasmon resonance biosensor (BIAcore Inc.). To study the CD8-H-2Kb interaction, we took advantage of the CD8 leucine zipper constructs by capturing the CD8-leucine zipper molecules with an anti-leucine zipper mAb coupled to the sensor chip by standard N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide chemistry following standard procedures (BIAcore). This approach aligns all CD8 molecules in a similarly ordered manner, making them accessible for the H-2Kb interaction. Because 2H11 has a relatively fast dissociation rate, we employed an additional mAb, termed 13A12, generated in our laboratory (data not shown). 20 μl of 13A12 at 100 μg/ml in 10 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, were immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min resulting in ∼5000 RU coupled. CD8ααf-LZ and H-2Kbsamples were buffer exchanged into PBS, which is equivalent to the buffer in the reservoir. 20 μl of CD8ααf-LZ (1 μm) were injected onto the 13A12 surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After a 5-min dissociation period, 5 μl/min of H-2Kb-VSV8 (64 μm) were injected onto the 13A12-CD8ααf-LZ surface. This procedure was repeated using H-2Kb-VSV8 concentrations of 1–32 μm. The specificity of the binding was assured by H-2Kbinjections (1–64 μm) directly onto the 13A12 surface (data not shown). The specific RU for H-2Kb-CD8ααf-LZ binding at equilibrium were determined by subtracting background RU (H-2Kb on the 13A12 surface) from the total RU. The Kd was derived from a Scatchard plot RU/concentration versus RU and linear regression analysis (Kaleidagraph software). The experiment was repeated three times with CD8αα-LZ and CD8ααf-LZ, and only once with CD8αβ-LZ, CD8αβf-LZ, CHO-CD8ααf-LZ, and CHO-CD8αβf-LZ. For all BIAcore studies, the H-2Kb α-chain (residues 1–274) and the murine-β2-microglobulin (residues 1–99) were expressed as separate inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and refolded in the presence of VSV8 peptide as described earlier (30Zhang W.

To obtain N15 CTL, splenocytes were isolated from Rag2−/− mice expressing a transgenic N15 TCR (36Ghendler Y. Hussey R.E. Witte T. Mizoguchi E. Clayton L.K. Bhan A.K. Koyasu S. Chang H.-C. Reinherz E.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and stimulated to obtain a short term cytotoxic T cell line as described previously (37Shibata K.-I.

For stimulation, the splenocytes were co-cultured in 24-well plates (5 × 106 cells/well) with irradiated N1 cells (5 × 105 cells/well). N1 cells constitutively present the cognate VSV8 peptide as an expressed minigene. After 5–7 days of culture with rat-derived concanavalin A supernatants, N15TCR+ CTLs were harvested and used as effector cells in the cytotoxicity assay. 1 × 106EL-4 target cells were labeled with 80 μCi of sodium [51Cr]chromate for 1 h at 37 °C. After four washings with RPMI complete, the Kb-expressing EL-4 cells were resuspended at 50,000 cells/ml in complete RPMI and transferred into 96-well U bottom plates (100 μl/well). To determine a suboptimal dose of peptide for inhibitory experiments, peptides were added at concentrations between 10−6 and 10−12m in a final volume of 100 μl of complete RPMI and incubated for 1 h. Finally, CTLs (100 μl) were added at an E:T ratio of 10:1 or 5:1, and 51Cr release was determined using standard conditions (36Ghendler Y. Hussey R.E. Witte T. Mizoguchi E. Clayton L.K. Bhan A.K. Koyasu S. Chang H.-C. Reinherz E.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the actual blocking experiment, EL-4 cells were pulsed with VSV8 at 2 × 10−10m. As a negative control either SEV9 (irrelevant peptide) or only PBS was added to the wells. Anti-CD8α 53.6.72 mAb was used as positive control, whereas a two-domain recombinant CD4 (rCD4) (38Wang J. Yan Y. Garrett T.P.J. Liu J.-H. Rodgers D.W. Garlick R.L. Tarr G.E. Husain Y. Reinherz E.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1990; 348: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) was used as a negative control for blocking experiments. 1 μm 53.6.72 mAb was added to CTL cells for 10 min at room temperature. CD8αα-LZ, CD8αβ-LZ, CD8ααf-LZ, CD8αβf-LZ, CHO-CD8ααf-LZ, and CHO-CD8αβf-LZ were concentrated using a Centricon-10 (Amicon), and 27.5–220 μm (final concentration) of CD8 protein or 27.5–220 μm of rCD4 were added to the antigen presenting cells 10 min prior to addition of 5 × 104N15 CTL (in 100 μl)/well. To determine background release, 100 μl of RPMI completed medium was added to 51Cr-labeled targets. The maximal 51Cr release was quantitated by adding 100 μl of 1% Triton X to 51Cr-labeled target cells. After 4 h at 37 °C, the plates were centrifuged, and 50% of the well solution was removed and counted in a γ-counter. A strategy to promote secretion of various soluble recombinant CD8 co-receptor protein fragments with homogeneous glycan adducts in the Lec3.2.8.1 eukaryotic cells was developed. To this end, a set of CD8 co-receptor constructs was produced as depicted schematically in Fig. 1. For example, the N-terminal extracellular segment of the mCD8α chain (residues 1–122) corresponding to the predicted Ig-like domain was fused via a flexible linker (residues 123–137) and a thrombin cleavage site to either an Acid-p1 or Base-p1 30-aa-long leucine zipper fragment to form CD8α-Acid (CD8α-A) and CD8α-Base (CD8α-B), respectively (Fig.1 A). Subsequently, cDNAs encoding CD8α-A and CD8α-B were transfected into Lec3.2.8.1 cells, and clones secreting the CD8αα ectodomain were screened by ELISA. mCD8αα-LZ protein was then affinity purified from the producer clone CD8-22-1 using the anti-leucine zipper mAb 2H11. As shown in Fig.2 A, under either nonreducing conditions (NR, lane 1) or reducing conditions (R, lane 2), the recombinant mCD8αα-LZ protein runs in the Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel as two bands corresponding to CD8α-A and CD8α-B monomer components with apparent molecular masses of 29 and 25 kDa, respectively. The difference in mobility of the CD8α chains is a consequence of the divergent charges within the appended acid or basic leucine zipper sequences. By this analysis, the affinity purified mCD8αα-LZ material is ∼90% pure with a 1:1 ratio of CD8α-A and CD8α-B. Although not shown, gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex 75 demonstrated that mCD8αα-LZ was dimeric and readily removed the trace amount of higher molecular mass contaminants and/or aggregates. Moreover, the expected N-terminal sequence of mCD8αα-LZ was verified by amino acid sequencing (not shown). The same strategy was then applied to the expression of the CD8αβ Ig-like domains in Lec 3.2.8.1. cells. The N-terminal extracellular segment of the mCD8β chain (residues 1–115) corresponding to the predicted Ig-like domain was fused via a flexible linker (residues 116–130) containing a thrombin cleavage site to the Acid-p1 peptide to yield CD8β-Acid (CD8β-A) (Fig. 1 B). The cDNA encoding the CD8β-A subunit was engineered into the pEE14 vector. Subsequently, the pEE14 CD8α-B and pEE14 CD8β-A plasmids were co-expressed in Lec3.2.8.1 cells, CD8αβ producing clones were identified by ELISA and mCD8αβ-LZ protein immunoaffinity purified using the anti-leucine zipper mAb 2H11. As shown in Fig. 2 B, under nonreducing conditions (NR, lane 3) and reducing conditions (R, lane 4), the recombinant mCD8αβ-LZ runs as closely spaced CD8β-A and CD8α-B monomers at molecular masses 26 and 25 kDa, respectively.

In this study we have examined how temperature and the expression of subunit chimeras can influence the efficiency of cell-surface expression of the rat α4β2 nAChR. Functional recombinant α4β2 nAChRs, showing high affinity binding of nicotinic radioligands (Kd = 41 ± 22 pm for [3H]epibatidine), are expressed in both stably and transiently transfected mammalian cell lines. Despite this, only very low levels of α4β2 nAChRs can be detected on the cell surface of transfected mammalian cells maintained at 37 °C. At 30 °C, however, cells expressing α4β2 nAChRs show a 12-fold increase in radioligand binding (with no change in affinity), and a 5-fold up-regulation in cell-surface receptors with no increase in total subunit protein. In contrast to “wild-type” α4 and β2 subunits, chimeric nicotinic/serotonergic subunits (“α4χ” and “β2χ”) are expressed very efficiently on the cell surface (at 30 °C or 37 °C), either as hetero-oligomeric complexes (e.g. α4χ+β2 or α4χ+β2χ) or when expressed alone. Compared with α4β2 nAChRs, expression of complexes containing chimeric subunits typically results in up to 20-fold increase in nicotinic radioligand binding sites (with no change in affinity) and a similar increase in cell-surface receptor, despite a similar level of total chimeric and wild-type protein.

Whereas the muscle-type nAChR is a pentameric complex of known subunit composition (α2βγδ in fetal muscle and α2βεδ in adult), the precise subunit composition of the various neuronal nAChR subtypes is less certain. To date, 11 neuronal nAChR subunits (α2–α9 and β2–β4) have been identified and cloned. There is evidence to suggest that the predominant neuronal nAChR subtype expressed in the vertebrate brain contains the α4 and β2 subunits (3Whiting P. Esch F. Shimasaki S. Lindstrom J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Flores C.M. Rogers S.W. Pabreza L.A. Wolfe B.B. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). When co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, α4 and β2 co-assemble to form functional nAChRs (5Boulter J. Connolly J. Deneris E. Goldman D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several studies have demonstrated that relatively high levels of functional nAChRs are expressed on the cell surface of mammalian fibroblasts transfected with muscle (α2βγδ or α2βεδ) nAChR subunit cDNAs (8Sine S.M.

In contrast, it appears that some neuronal nAChR subunit combinations are expressed considerably less efficiently when expressed heterologously in mammalian cell lines. In particular, the neuronal nAChR α7 and α8 subunits, which readily form functional homo-oligomeric nAChRs when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, appear to fold and assemble very inefficiently in many mammalian cell types (10Cooper S.T.

Functional expression of recombinant α4β2 nAChRs in mammalian cell lines has been demonstrated previously (18Whiting P. Schoepfer R. Lindstrom J. Priestley T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 463-472PubMed Google Scholar, 19Buisson B. Gopalakrishnan M. Arneric S.P. Sullivan J.P. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7880-7891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ragozzino D.

Chronic exposure to nicotine has been shown to result in an increase in radioligand binding sites in cell lines expressing recombinant α4β2 nAChRs (21Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bencherif M. Fowler K. Lukas R. Lippiello P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 987-994PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Gong Z.-H. Hellstrom-Lindahl E. Nordberg A. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and correlates with an up-regulation (by ∼2-fold) of the number of cell-surface nAChRs (21Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite up-regulation of cell-surface nAChRs, chronic treatment with nicotine has been reported to result in persistent functional inactivation of both recombinant α4β2 and native nAChRs (21Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lukas R.J. J.

It has been suggested that this “persistent inactivation” may be a consequence of the receptor adopting a long-lasting desensitized state. A 2-fold up-regulation in the level of cell-surface α4β2 nAChR has also been reported as a consequence of treatments which elevate intracellular cAMP (26Rothhut B. Romano S.J. Vijayaraghavan S. Berg D.K. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has also been shown previously that subunit folding and assembly of some nAChRs, notably those of invertebrates and of cold water fish such as Torpedo, when expressed in mammalian cell lines, is more efficient at lower temperatures (27Paulson H.L. Claudio T. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1705-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Lansdell S.J. Schmitt B. Betz H. Sattelle D.B. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined factors that dramatically influence the efficiency of cell-surface expression of the rat neuronal α4β2 nAChR expressed heterologously in mammalian cell lines. We constructed two subunit chimeras, which contain the N-terminal domain of the α4 or β2 nAChR subunits and the C terminus of the 5HT3receptor subunit, similar to the α7/5HT3 chimera described previously (16Eiselé J.-L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Nature. 1993; 366: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). We have shown that substitution of chimeric subunits for wild-type subunits can increase levels of radioligand binding and cell-surface expression by up to ∼20-fold. In addition, we also demonstrate that lower temperature (30 °C) increases total radioligand binding (∼12-fold) and results in an up-regulation of cell-surface receptors (∼5-fold) in mammalian cells transfected with wild-type α4 and β2 nAChR subunits.

Mouse fibroblast L929 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (no. 85011425). Chimeric nicotinic/serotonergic subunit cDNAs were constructed in the expression vector pRK5, described previously (36Schall T.J. Lewis M. Koller K.J. Lee A. Rice G.C. Wong G.H.W. Gatanaga T.

Polymerase chain reaction fragments were amplified from pcDNAI/Neo-α4 and pcDNAI/Neo-β2 by use of a 5′ primer to the pcDNAI/Neo T7 priming site and a 3′ primer, specific to either the α4 or β2 cDNAs, which introduced a silent Bcl I site at a position equivalent to the Bcl I site in pRK5-α7(V201)/5HT3, described previously (11Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with Eco RI and Bcl I and ligated into pRK5-α7/5HT3, which had been digested with Eco RI and Bcl I to remove the α7 cDNA fragment to create pRK5-α4/5HT3 and pRK5-β2/5HT3 (also referred to here as pRK5-α4χ and pRK5-β2χ, respectively). The α4 and β2 subunit cDNAs were subcloned from pcDNAI/Neo into pRK5 (to enable comparison of transient expression levels in TSA201 cells to those of chimeric subunits in identical expression vectors) and into pMSG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), to enable establishment of an inducible stable cell line in L929 cells (see below). All plasmid constructs were verified by restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2 mml-glutamine, plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and maintained in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at either 37 °C or 30 °C. Human TSA201 cells were transfected either by a modified calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4816) Google Scholar) or by Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, cells were transfected overnight and assayed for expression approximately 42–44 h after transfection. Mouse L929 cells were stably transfected with pMSG-α4 and pMSG-β2 by calcium phosphate co-precipitation, and clonal cell lines were selected by serial dilution in the presence of mycophenolic acid and aminopterin, as has been described previously (38Lewis T.M. Harkness P.C. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Millar N.S. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Expression of α4 and β2 mRNA in clonal L929-α4β2 cells was induced by the addition of dexamethasone (1 μm final concentration) to the culture medium, typically for 5–10 days. Binding studies with [3H]epibatidine (NEN Life Science Products; specific activity 1.25 TBq/mmol) were performed on cell membrane preparations as has been described previously (28Lansdell S.J. Schmitt B. Betz H. Sattelle D.B. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Curves for equilibrium binding were fitted by weighted least-squares (CVFIT program, David Colquhoun, University College London). Amounts of total cellular protein were determined by a Bio-Rad DC protein assay using BSA standards. Fluorescent ratiometric intracellular calcium measurements were performed on cell populations (typically 5 × 106 cells) loaded with 4 μm fura2-AM (Molecular Probes) using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorescence spectrometer fitted with a stirred cuvette holder and fast filter accessory. Details of cell loading and fluorimetry have been described previously (10Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was alternated rapidly between 340 and 380 nm and emitted fluorescence detected at 510 nm. A 340 nm/380 nm ratio was calculated every 40 ms and data averaged over four ratio data measurements. Maximum and minimum fluorescence levels were determined by addition of Triton X-100 (0.1% final concentration) and MnCl2 (10 mmfinal concentration), respectively. Agonist-evoked responses were normalized to the maximum fluorescence level to enable comparison between experiments. Cells were transiently transfected overnight in 6-cm tissue culture dishes, as described above. To starve cells of methionine, cells were washed twice with, and bathed for 10 min in l-methionine (Met)-free andl-cysteine (Cys)-free DMEM (Sigma) containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.37 mg/liter NaHCO3. Cells were labeled with 125 μCi of Redivue Pro-mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; a mixture of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys) in 1.5 ml of Met/Cys-free DMEM for 30 min. Samples were washed three times and then chased with 8 ml of complete DMEM containing 30 mg ofl-Met, 48 mg of l-Cys, and 10% fetal calf serum. Metabolically labeled cells were rinsed with PBS and solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (LB) containing protease inhibitors (LB; 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris/Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm N-ethylmaleimide, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Samples were immunoprecipitated with mAb 270 or mAb 299 followed by Protein G-Sepharose (Calbiochem) as has been described (10Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were solubilized in LB and 250 μl layered onto a 5-ml, linear 5–20% sucrose gradient prepared in lysis buffer. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman XL-80 Ultracentrifuge at 4 °C using a SW-55 Ti swing-out rotor at 40,000 rpm to ω2 t = 9.00 × 1011 rad2/s (approximately 14 h). Fifteen fractions of 320 μl were taken from the top of the gradient. Cells were transiently transfected on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Coverslips were washed once in Hanks' balanced saline solution (HBSS; Life Technologies, Inc.), blocked for 5–10 min in HBSS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated with primary antibody in HBSS + BSA in a humidified chamber for 1–2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed four times in PBS, fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde, and washed three times. Coverslips were blocked in HBSS + BSA and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Pierce) for 1 h, washed four times, and mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem). Levels of cell-surface immunofluorescent staining were examined with a Leica TCS SP laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 63 × 1.32 numerical aperture oil-immersion PlanApo objective using identical photomultiplier tube settings for all fluorescent images. Digital images (512 × 512 pixels) were captured using Leica TCS NT software. Cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected, incubated in primary antibody, and fixed as described for immunofluorescent microscopy (see above). Coverslips were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed six times and incubated with 500 μl of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) for exactly 1 h. The supernatant was transferred to a cuvette and absorbance determined at 655 nm in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer. Cell-surface receptors were cross-linked with the thiol-cleavable reagent dithiobis-sulfosuccinimidylpropionate (DTSSP; Pierce). Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 2.5 mmDTSSP in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times in PBS, cells were solubilized in LB and subjected to sucrose-gradient centrifugation, as described above. Individual gradient fractions were mixed with 2× sample buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol and the distribution of α4χ and β2χ protein determined by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-5HT3 serum (34Turton S. Gillard N.P. Stephenson F.A. McKernan R.M. Mol. Neuropharmacol. 1993; 3: 167-171Google Scholar), as described below. Samples from sucrose gradient fractions (50–70 μl) or samples of total cellular material (250 μg) were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were equilibrated for 20 min in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3) and then electroblotted onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked by incubation with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk powder, then incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution for 1–2 h at room temperature. The nitrocellulose membrane was washed thoroughly, incubated with 1:5000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat-α-rat IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or goat-α-rabbit IgG (Pierce), and processed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Functional recombinant α4β2 nAChRs, showing high affinity binding of nicotinic radioligands (Kd = 41 ± 22 pm for [3H]epibatidine), were detected in human embryonic kidney TSA201 cells after co-transfection with rat neuronal nAChR α4 and β2 subunit cDNAs (Fig.1 A). In contrast, neither functional nAChRs nor specific binding of nicotinic radioligands could be detected when either α4 or β2 subunits were expressed individually. Despite clear evidence for the co-assembly of α4 and β2 subunits into functional nAChRs, as shown by agonist-induced elevations in intracellular calcium (Fig. 1 B), we could detect only moderate levels of total radioligand binding (Bmax = 195 ± 67 fmol/mg, mean of five separate transfections). We have detected significantly higher Bmax values in TSA201 cell lines transfected with other ligand-gated ion channels, such as the mouse serotonin receptor 5HT3 subunit, where we can routinely detect 10–20-fold higher total radioligand ([3H]GR65630) binding, using the same expression vector (pRK5) under identical transfection conditions. The relatively low Bmaxvalue seen when α4 and β2 are co-expressed in TSA201 cells is similar to the levels of radioligand binding we have seen in a mouse fibroblast (L929) cell line stably co-transfected with α4 and β2 (Bmax = 148 ± 30 fmol/mg) and in several other mammalian cell lines transiently co-transfected with α4 and β2 (data not shown). It is also similar to the Bmax value (∼100 fmol/mg), which we determined previously in a stable L929 cell line co-transfected with nAChR α3 and β4 subunit cDNAs (38Lewis T.M. Harkness P.C. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Millar N.S. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A dramatic increase (∼12-fold) in the level of total [3H]epibatidine binding was observed when TSA201 cells, co-transfected with α4 and β2, were incubated at 30 °C (Fig.2 A) with no change in affinity for epibatidine (Kd = 38 ± 2 pm). Evidence that this corresponds to an increase in the level of assembled receptor was obtained by sucrose-gradient sedimentation (Fig.2 B). In addition, we have consistently observed ∼2-fold larger agonist-induced elevations in intracellular calcium levels in TSA201-α4β2 cells maintained at 30 °C compared with cells maintained at 37 °C (1.7 ± 0.4-fold increase, mean of seven independent determinations). We have also observed a similar increase in the magnitude of intracellular calcium responses in stably transfected L929-α4β2 cells maintained at 30 °C, rather than 37 °C (data not shown). Although this would appear to indicate a significant increase in the number of functional nAChRs in cells maintained at 30 °C, a more rigorous assay to determine the relative number of functional channels will require detailed whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiological characterization. We and others have shown previously that the profound host cell-dependent folding of α7 and α8 nAChR subunits is not observed with chimeric subunits containing the extracellular domain of the nicotinic α7 or α8 subunits together with the putative transmembrane and intracellular regions of the serotonin receptor 5HT3 subunit (11Cooper S.T. Millar N.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Eiselé J.-L. Bertrand S. Galzi J.-L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D.

We have constructed two similar subunit chimeras (α4/5HT3 and β2/5HT3, which will be referred to subsequently as α4χ and β2χ, respectively). Chimeric (α4χ and β2χ) and wild-type (α4 and β2) subunit cDNAs, subcloned into the same mammalian expression vector (pRK5), were transiently transfected into TSA201 cells under identical conditions. Transfection of pairwise combinations of chimeric and wild-type subunits resulted in the formation of high levels of specific [3H]epibatidine binding sites. Co-expression of α4χ + β2, or α4χ + β2χ, resulted in an ∼20-fold up-regulation in specific [3H]epibatidine binding sites, compared with levels obtained following co-expression of wild-type α4 + β2 subunits (Fig. 2 C). Co-expression of α4 + β2χ resulted in a 5-fold up-regulation in specific [3H]epibatidine binding, compared with levels obtained with wild-type α4β2 (Fig.2 C). As we observed with wild-type α4 or β2 subunits, no high affinity [3H]epibatidine binding could be detected when either of the chimeric (α4χ or β2χ) subunits were expressed alone (Fig.2 C). We were, however, able to detect very low affinity binding of [3H]epibatidine to α4χ expressed alone (0.5 μm [3H]epibatidine produced only low levels of specific binding and failed to saturate). In contrast, saturation binding studies with hetero-oligomeric nAChRs containing chimeric subunits (α4χ+β2 or α4+β2χ) showed high affinity binding of [3H]epibatidine. Hetero-oligomeric complexes containing either α4χ or β2χ showed no significant difference in their affinity for [3H]epibatidine (Kd = 51 ± 31 pm for α4χ+β2) compared with that determined for the α4β2 nAChR (Kd = 41 ± 22 nm). These data demonstrate that formation of a high affinity nicotinic binding site requires the co-assembly of both the α4 and β2 subunit extracellular domains, and that the nicotinic radioligand binding site is preserved in the chimeric subunits. As described earlier, a 12-fold increase in [3H]epibatidine binding was observed when cells transfected with wild-type α4β2 were maintained at a lower temperature. We examined the influence of temperature upon levels of [3H]epibatidine binding to cells expressing receptors containing chimeric subunits. A 3-fold increase in total [3H]epibatidine binding was observed with cells transfected with α4+β2χ (Fig. 2 D). A less pronounced effect was detected with cells expressing α4χ+β2 or α4χ+β2χ (Fig. 2 D). This indicates that nAChR combinations containing the α4χ, which express very efficiently at 37 °C, are not influenced as greatly by lower temperature. In contrast, lower temperature has a more pronounced effect on nAChR combinations containing the wild-type α4 subunit (α4+β2 and α4+β2χ), where levels of radioligand binding are lower at 37 °C. Despite evidence for the expression of functional nAChRs in mammalian cells transfected with α4 and β2, we have consistently detected only very low levels of cell-surface receptors by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. The low level of cell-surface staining (with mAb 270) in transiently transfected TSA201 cells at 37 °C is illustrated in Fig.3 A. We have routinely observed similarly low levels of cell-surface nAChRs in other mammalian cell types transfected with α4 and β2, including stably transfected mouse fibroblast L929 cells (data not shown), confirming that low levels of cell-surface expression is not a phenomenon exclusive to transfected TSA201 cells. We examined the influence of lower temperature and of chimeric subunits upon the level of cell-surface nAChR expression in TSA201 cells. Cells transfected with various subunit combinations were incubated with mAb 270, which recognizes an extracellular epitope on the β2 subunit, followed by a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody. Very bright cell-surface staining of the β2 subunit was observed in cells expressing α4χ+β2 (Fig.3 C), which was considerably brighter than when β2 was co-expressed with the wild-type α4 subunit (Fig. 3 A). A clear elevation in levels of cell-surface β2 expression was also observed when cells transfected with α4β2 were incubated at 30 °C (Fig. 3 B), rather than 37 °C. No cell-surface staining could be detected when either wild-type α4 or β2 subunits were expressed alone (with mAbs 299 and 270, respectively). However, when either α4χ or β2χ were expressed alone, very bright cell-surface immunofluorescent staining was detected (data not shown). In order to obtain a more quantitative estimate of the relative levels of cell-surface nAChRs, we employed an enzyme-linked antibody assay. Transfected cells were incubat"

Recent structural studies revealed that the active site of colicin DNases encompasses the HNH motif found in homing endonucleases, and bound within this motif a single transition metal ion (either Zn2+ or Ni2+) the role of which is unknown. In the present work we find that neither Zn2+ nor Ni2+ is required for DNase activity, which instead requires Mg2+ ions, but binding transition metals to the E9 DNase causes subtle changes to both secondary and tertiary structure. Spectroscopic, proteolytic, and calorimetric data show that, accompanying the binding of 1 eq of Zn2+, Ni2+, or Co2+, the thermodynamic stability of the domain increased substantially, and that the equilibrium dissociation constant for Zn2+ was less than or equal to nanomolar, while that for Co2+ and Ni 2+ was micromolar. Our data demonstrate that the transition metal is not essential for colicin DNase activity but rather serves a structural role. We speculate that the HNH motif has been adapted for use by endonuclease colicins because of its involvement in DNA recognition and because removal of the bound metal ion destabilizes the DNase domain, a likely prerequisite for its translocation across bacterial membranes.

Microbiol. 1957; 11: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), with much of this work revolving around how these folded proteins are able to traverse the membrane barriers of a bacterium (reviewed in Ref. 3Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubès R. Bénédetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This process is distinct from that of mitochondrial import in eukaryotic cells since colicins do not possess signal sequences but rather are dependent on the activities of three domains: a central receptor recognition domain involved in binding to outer membrane nutrient receptors; an N-terminal translocation domain, which, through its interactions with several periplasmic proteins, causes the outer membrane to be breached allowing the C-terminal cytotoxic domain to enter the periplasm. This latter activity is most often a voltage-gated ionophore (colicins A, B, Ia, E1, and N, for example), which associates with the inner membrane as a molten globule, and then depolarizes the cell (4van der Groot F.G.

Of the many different types of colicin that have been identified, perhaps the most unusual are the nuclease family of E colicins (reviewed in Ref. 7James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Nuclease colicins require the outer membrane vitamin B12 receptor BtuB as well as the porin OmpF and the Tol proteins (located in both the periplasm and inner membrane) for import. This complex machinery is needed to translocate the cytotoxic domain across both membranes of Escherichia coli in an energy-independent process in order that they reach their cytosolic targets, ribosomal RNA for colicin E3 (8Boon T.

Biochem. 1992; 207: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Little is known of the mechanisms of membrane penetration by this family of nuclease colicins. Colicin-producing bacteria protect themselves by co-synthesizing an immunity protein that neutralizes the activity of the toxin (15Jakes K. Zinder N.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3380-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For pore-forming colicins, immunity is needed to prevent cell death from toxin molecules penetrating a producing organism, since the ionophore is only active from the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. Thus, the immunity protein takes the form of a membrane protein that prevents the insertion of an incoming colicin into the inner membrane (16Géli V. Baty D. Lazdunski C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). By contrast, nuclease colicins can kill cells the moment their synthesis is complete and so have evolved a highly efficient immunity system to combat suicide (17Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Cramer W.A. Lindeberg M. Taylor R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 295-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 9.5-kDa immunity protein Im9,1 for example, folds into its distorted four-helical bundle structure with a rate constant of 2200 s−1; thus, folded immunity protein appears in <1 ms once SOS induction of the colicin operon is activated (17Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The folded Im9 then associates with the colicin E9 DNase at the rate of diffusion to form an inactive complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 9.3 × 10−17m, one of the highest affinity protein-protein interactions yet reported (19Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As well as exhibiting high affinity binding, colicin-immunity protein complexes are also very specific since non-cognate immunity proteins such as Im2 and Im8 bind (and inactivate) the DNase of colicin E9 6–8 orders of magnitude less tightly than the cognate Im9 (20Wallis R. Leung K.-Y. Pommer A. Videler H., R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13751-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Following colicin immunity protein association, the heterodimeric complex is released into the extracellular medium through the action of the bacteriocin release protein (7James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The complex is able to bind to outer membrane receptors and penetrate and kill an unprotected cell, but only after the bound immunity protein is released during the translocation process (21Kleanthous C. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of the 15-kDa DNase domains of colicins E9 and E7 in complex with their cognate immunity proteins Im9 and Im7, respectively, revealed that the immunity protein does not bind within the active site cleft of the DNase but adjacent to it (17Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). From these studies it was argued that inactivation of the colicin occurs through steric and electrostatic occlusion of substrate DNA, consistent with solution data demonstrating the inability of the complex to bind dsDNA, even though the active site cleft of the DNase is wide enough to accommodate substrate (17Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The two structures also revealed that colicin DNases are metalloproteins, containing single, tetrahedrally coordinated transition metals within their active sites, located more than 10 Å away from the protein-protein interface. Zinc was found in the E7 structure, while nickel was observed in the E9 structure (Refs.22Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and 17Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, respectively). In both studies, the role of the metal ion was unknown but suggested to be either structural and/or catalytic. Of particular interest in the E9 DNase work was the first structural description of the so-called HNH motif, a sequence motif found in homing endonucleases that had previously been identified in colicins (23Shub D.A. Goodrich-Blair H. Eddy S.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 402-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Gorbalenya A.E. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1117-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These enzymes are encoded by self-splicing introns or inteins that promote the homing of genetic elements containing the genes for the nucleases into intronless or inteinless alleles in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (25Belfort M. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The motif covers 32 amino acids at the C terminus of the E9 DNase domain and encompasses the bound metal ion and three histidine ligands (Fig. 1). The occurrence of a metal ion in the active site of the E9 DNase was unexpected, leaving its role open to speculation. Indeed, there have been no reports in the literature on the potential role of transition metals in the HNH family of homing endonucleases. Due to the differing ways in which the DNase domains of colicin E7 and E9 were produced in the two recent structural studies, different metal centers were found in each protein bound by the same amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The E7 DNase-Im7 complex was expressed as a histidine-tagged complex (in which the Im7 protein carried the tag) and the structure solved by molecular replacement using the previously solved Im7 crystal structure (22Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Chak K.-F. Safo M.K. Ku W.-Y. Hsieh S.-Y. Yuan H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6437-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Atomic absorption experiments indicated that zinc was the predominant metal in this complex, although nickel could also be detected (22Ko T.-P. Liao C.-C. Ku W.-Y. Chak K.-F. Yuan H.S. Structure. 1999; 7: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E9 DNase-Im9 complex was solved by multiple anomalous dispersion phasing, in which either one or both of the subunits was labeled with selenomethionine, by preparing each of the components separately and then forming and crystallizing the complex (27Kühlmann U. Kleanthous C. James R. Moore G.R. Hemmings A.M. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 55: 256-259Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The E9 DNase was purified as described by Garinot-Schneider et al.

Biol. 1996; 260: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), by co-expressing the domain with histidine-tagged Im9 and purifying the complex on a nickel-affinity column, followed by denaturation of the domain, to achieve its separation from the tightly bound Im9 protein, and refolding by dialysis. This form of the enzyme contains only nickel, as determined by atomic absorption (17Kleanthous C. Kühlmann U.C. Pommer A.J. Ferguson N. Radford S.E. Moore G.R. James R. Hemmings A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). E9 DNase prepared by this route is active as an endonuclease and binds stoichiometric amounts of Im9, which can be expressed separately and to high yield in bacteria in the absence of the DNase (14Wallis R. Reilly A. Rowe A. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Even though the complexes of the E9 and E7 DNases with their immunities were prepared by different methods, the resulting crystal structures are very similar, indicating that denaturation of the DNase does not affect the final structure. Where the structures differ, however, is in the metal that is bound within the HNH motif and the identity of the fourth ligand; phosphate in the E9 structure, water in E7. The aim of the present work was to define the role of the transition metal site within the HNH motif of colicin endonucleases. Through a series of activity and biophysical experiments using the E9 DNase domain, we compared the properties of apo- and holoenzyme; based on these results we suggest how the creation of apo-enzyme might be important in the translocation of these toxins across bacterial membranes. Plasmid pRJ353 (encoding the E9 DNase domain and Im9 with a C-terminal histidine tag) was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and cells grown on Luria-Bertani broth. The E9 DNase and the mutant His127 → Ala E9 DNase were purified as described by Garinot-Schneider et al. (28Garinot-Schneider C. Pommer A.J. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, to produce metal-free apo-protein, the E9 DNase was unfolded in 3 mguanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl; BDH) and pre-incubated with a 4-fold excess of EDTA and gel-filtered in the presence of 3 mguanidine hydrochloride and 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0. The denaturant was then removed by extensive dialysis against 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mmNaCl in AnalaR water and finally against AnalaR water. Apo-enzyme was also produced by incubating native protein (in 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0) in the presence of EDTA and removing the chelator by dialysis against the same buffer containing 200 mm NaCl in AnalaR water and finally against AnalaR water. Protein concentrations were obtained by absorbance at 280 nm (ε280 = 17, 550 m−1cm−1) (19Wallis R. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13743-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Plasmid-nicking activity of the E9 DNase was determined essentially as described by Pommer et al. (29Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that unlabeled pUC18 was used as substrate under defined metal regimes. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was performed at 20 °C using a Jasco spectropolarimeter. The protein concentration was 0.25 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. A 0.02-cm cuvette was used and far UV spectra recorded from 190 to 260 nm. Measurements of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission were made using a Shimadzu RF5000 spectrofluorimeter, thermostated at 25 °C and in filtered 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 450 nm. The excitation bandwidth was set to 5 nm and the emission bandwidth to 10 nm, and 3-ml quartz cuvettes were used. The protein concentration was 27 μg/ml (1.8 μm). GdnHCl-dependent denaturation of the E9 DNase domain was also investigated by tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopy, wherein the protein (9 μg/ml; 0.6 μm) with or without added metal was incubated with different GdnHCl concentrations, equilibrated for 2 h at 25 °C, and fluorescence measurements taken as described above. In fluorescence experiments using the dye 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS), emission was measured using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission spectra recorded from 390 to 650 nm. Quartz cuvettes (3 ml) were used containing 1.5 ml of Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 13.2 μmE9 DNase or H127A E9 DNase. The ANS concentration was 20 μm for E9 DNase and 40 μm for the His127 → Ala mutant. For all experiments, metals were made up in AnalaR water and added in 1–2-μl aliquots using a Hamilton syringe to minimize dilution effects. Proteolytic digestions of E9 DNase (1 mg/ml) were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer at pH 8.5 and at 37 °C using 1% trypsin (Worthington) in the presence and absence of added metal ions. 5-μl samples (5 μg) were taken after various time periods; the trypsin was inactivated with soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor (Sigma), mixed with sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20%). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out at 25 °C using a Microcal Omega or VP-ITC titration calorimeter and following standard procedures (30Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 31Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 22: 137-150PubMed Google Scholar). The protein solution (50 μm) was dialyzed into 50 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.5, and gently degassed prior to loading into the sample cell (1.4-ml working volume). A typical experiment involved 25 10-μl injections of ligand (1 mm metal in 50 mm TEA buffer, pH 7.5) into the protein solution, with stirring of the injection syringe (320–400 rpm, depending on the instrument). Control dilution experiments involving injection of ligand into buffer, or buffer into protein, under identical conditions, showed no significant heat effects. Calorimetric data were analyzed with Microcal Origin software using a single site, non-cooperative binding model. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of protein in the presence and absence of metal ligand was done using a Microcal VP-DSC instrument under standard operating conditions (32Plotnikov V.V. Brandts J.M. Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with a scan rate of 60 °C h−1. Protein solutions were dialyzed and degassed as above prior to loading, and dialysis buffer was used in the DSC reference cell. Transition metals such as zinc and nickel can perform catalytic functions in enzyme active sites (33Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994Google Scholar), and the presence of one or other in the HNH motif of this family of endonucleases suggested their involvement in catalysis. We therefore investigated the effect of these metals on the ability of the E9 DNase to cleave plasmid DNA (Fig. 2). Prior to the x-ray structures of colicin DNases, previous studies on the effects of metal ions on E9 DNase cleavage of DNA did not take into account the possibility that the enzyme contained bound metals (29Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is likely that previous protein preparations used in enzymic assays were mixtures of both metal-loaded and apo-enzyme. Hence, the question of transition metal involvement in catalysis was re-examined under defined metal-loading conditions by comparing the plasmid nicking activities of apo- and holoenzyme (Fig. 2). Apo-enzyme was prepared by incubating the enzyme with EDTA in either the folded or unfolded state (using guanidine hydrochloride as a denaturant) followed by removal of the chelating agent (and denaturant) by gel-filtration chromatography or dialysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results were essentially identical regardless of the method used to generate the metal-free form of the enzyme. Atomic absorption analyses indicated the absence of any bound metal (data not shown). At pH 7.5 and at 29 °C, apo-E9 DNase showed no endonuclease activity in the absence of added cations (Fig. 2 A). The addition of Mg2+ ions (10 mm) readily caused nicking of the substrate by the apo-enzyme (Fig. 2 B), eventually degrading the DNA completely (data not shown). The inclusion of Zn2+ (10 μm is sufficient to saturate the single metal site; see below) with Mg2+ did not yield faster rates of DNA cleavage (Fig. 2 C), but rather resulted in slight inhibition of the Mg-dependent DNase activity. Inhibition by zinc was even more pronounced at elevated temperatures where the DNase is more active (data not shown). Incubation of the enzyme with 10 μmzinc alone (Fig. 2 D) induced no cleavage of the DNA, even at relatively high concentrations (0.5 mm; data not shown). In contrast, the addition of 10 μm Ni2+increased (by ∼2-fold) the Mg2+-dependent activity of the E9 DNase (data not shown). The present data demonstrate that the transition metal bound in the HNH motif of colicin endonucleases is not essential for the random hydrolysis of plasmid DNA substrates and indeed may even inhibit this activity, which is dependent on magnesium ions. In order to investigate further the role of transition metals in the function of colicin endonucleases, we analyzed the effect of transition metal ion binding on both secondary and tertiary structure. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments have shown previously that the E9 DNase, prepared as described above, is a folded domain, and analytical ultracentrifugation has shown the domain to be monomeric in solution (29Pommer A.J. Wallis R. Moore R. James R. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that small but significant changes occur in the far UV CD spectrum of the E9 DNase on binding Ni2+ (Fig.3 A). The most significant change occurred at 210 and 230 nm, and these changes could be reversed by the addition of EDTA (data not shown). The alterations in secondary structure also result in changes to tertiary structure. The intrinsic tryptophan emission fluorescence of the E9 DNase (which contains two tryptophan residues) shows a slight enhancement on removing bound Ni2+or Zn2+, while the λmax for the fluorescence emission (334 nm) remains unchanged (Fig.3 B). This indicates that the effects of removing the metal ion are not the result of global denaturation, which instead leads to a quench in the tryptophan fluorescence (see Fig. 5 B) and a shift in the emission maximum to 350 nm. This is also consistent with near UV circular dichroism spectra showing that relatively minor changes result from the removal of bound metal (data not shown). Taken together these data imply that apo-protein retains a fold similar to that of the holoenzyme and that the structural changes that occur as a result of removing the bound metal are probably localized around the metal site.Figure 5Metal binding to the HNH motif of the E9 DNase increases the conformational stability of the domain.

Data are shown as normalized for excess heat capacity changes with increasing temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although removal of bound metal ion causes relatively minor changes to the secondary and tertiary structure of the E9 DNase, this nonetheless results in an increase in the exposure of non-polar groups as deduced by experiments with the dye ANS. As can be seen in Fig.4, apo-E9 DNase shows a significant ANS fluorescence emission at ∼490 nm, which on binding transition metals (Ni2+ is shown in Fig. 4, but identical results were obtained with Zn2+) is quenched approximately 2-fold, indicating the burial of these exposed hydrophobic regions. The stoichiometry of transition metal ion binding to the E9 DNase was estimated by this quench in fluorescence to be close to 1-to-1 for Ni2+ (Fig. 4), Zn2+, and Co2+, whereas magnesium ions did not affect the ANS fluorescence of the apo-enzyme (data not shown). To ensure that the ANS fluorescence derived from dye binding to apo-E9 DNase and that the resulting quench was indeed due to metal binding to the HNH motif, a control experiment was carried out using a single site mutant of the DNase in which one of the metal co-ordination sites, His127, was mutated to alanine (Figs. 1 and 4 and Ref. 28Garinot-Schneider C. Pommer A.J. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The His127 → Ala mutant also binds ANS, but in this case transition metals did not cause a change in fluorescence. This verified the identity of this residue as a metal co-ordination site and indicated that the ANS fluorescence quench experiments are indeed monitoring changes to protein tertiary structure as a result of transition metal ion binding to the HNH motif of the E9 DNase. The increase in ANS binding of apo-E9 DNase relative to holoenzyme suggested that the conformational stability of the domain may be affected by metal ions. We therefore investigated this possibility using proteolysis, chemical denaturation, and calorimetry. Proteolytic susceptibility of proteins is often used as an indicator of thermodynamic stability since unstable proteins are better proteolytic substrates than their stable counterparts. Hence, the proteolytic susceptibility of apo-E9 DNase domain was compared with that in the presence of zinc (Fig. 5 A). Identical results were obtained for nickel and cobalt (data not shown). Removal of the bound metal ion elevated the proteolytic susceptibility of the domain to the point where the apo-enzyme was completely digested with 1% trypsin in under 10 min. Addition of 1 eq of zinc to the enzyme significantly increased its resistance to proteolysis, consistent with the metal increasing the stability of the domain. Control experiments indicated that metals did not affect the activity of trypsin against a non-metal-containing protein (data not shown). Notwithstanding the overall increase in proteolytic resistance of the metal-bound form of the enzyme, a single tryptic cleavage did occur at the N terminus of the E9 DNase at Arg5 (deduced from sequencing of the blotted fragment) (Fig. 5 A). This corresponds to the tryptic cleavage site identified by Wallis et al. (34Wallis R. Reilly A. Barnes K. Abell C. Campbell D.G. Moore G.R. James R. Kleanthous C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 447-454Cros"

By helping to set the levels of key intracellular regulatory proteins, the Ub pathway plays a major role in critical processes such as the regulation of the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). The function of Ub in proteolysis is that of a covalent signal; attachment of the C terminus of Ub (G76) to the side chain of an internal lysine residue of the target protein ultimately confers recognition by the 26 S proteasome. Conjugation occurs in three sequential enzymatic steps (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar): 1) ATP-dependent activation of the Ub C terminus through the formation of a thiol ester with Ub-activating enzyme or E1; 2) Ub transfer to a Cys residue of a Ub-conjugating enzyme or E2; and 3) Ub transfer from the E2 to the substrate catalyzed by a ligase or E3. Specific E2s and E3s cooperate in the recognition of individual substrates of the pathway (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). These two enzymes form a complex; the E3 appears to play the major role in substrate binding. Substrates destined for turnover by the proteasome are usually conjugated to multiple Ub molecules in the form of a polymeric chain linked by isopeptide bonds between Lys-48 of Ubn, and Gly-76 of Ubn+1 (4Chau V.

The extreme inhibition of proteolysis caused by the K48R mutation in Ub indicates that targeting to the proteasome is mediated primarily through the recognition of Lys-48-linked polyUb chains (4Chau V.

We have presented evidence that the proteasomal signaling function of these chains depends upon a specific conformation that is stabilized by defined contacts among the Ub moieties in the chain (8Cook W.J.

Little is yet known about the enzymatic mechanisms by which chains are assembled on target proteins (see Ref. 6Pickart C.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the same E3 that conjugates the first Ub to the substrate also elongates the chain. An alternative model postulates the existence of two types of conjugating pathways, namely substrate-specific and Ub-specific. A Ub-specific E2/E3 could preassemble a chain for use by a substrate-specific E2/E3, or a Ub-specific E2/E3 could extend a chain from an initiator Ub conjugated to the target protein by a substrate-specific E2/E3 (see “Results and Discussion”). Although there are detectable levels of unanchored polyUb chains in cells (7Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell.

However, support for the existence of Ub-specific conjugating enzymes derives from the properties of the UFD2 and UFD4 gene products of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Refs. 17Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M.

PolyUb chains linked through lysine residues other than Lys-48 have been identified both in cells and in vitro (reviewed in Ref.19Pickart C.M. Peters J. Harris R. Finley D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1998: 19-63Crossref Google Scholar). The degradation of a Ub-DHFR fusion protein in yeast cells depends on the ligation of a polyUb chain to Lys-29 of the fused Ub moiety and on the presence of an E3, Ufd4p, which appears to recognize this Ub moiety (17Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In some instances, the Ufd4p-dependent elongation of polyUb chains also requires a novel factor known as Ufd2p (17Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 18Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). In such cases, short Ub oligomers assembled by Ufd4p initiate at Lys-29, but the subsequent linkages in these short chains and in longer chains assembled in the presence of Ufd2p are uncharacterized (18Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Several other lysine residues of Ub have also been implicated in polyUb chain assembly. Purified human E2EPF cooperates with an unidentified E3 to assemble chains harboring Lys-11 linkages (20Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); these chains are functional in degradation in vitro (21Liu Z. Haas A.L. Diaz L.A. Conrad C.A. Giudice G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The proteolytic signaling competence of chains harboring Lys-6 linkages, which can be assembled on histones by purified Rad6p, remains to be evaluated (20Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Chains harboring Lys-63 linkages apparently do not play an important role in protein turnover, but they have been implicated in DNA repair (14Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) in yeast. Thus, Lys-63-linked chains and perhaps certain other chains may signal fates other than proteasomal proteolysis. We are interested in the signaling potentials of novel polyUb chains and in the identities and properties of enzymes that assemble such chains in vivo. The studies described here were motivated by results of Bamezai and Breslow (25Bamezai S. Breslow E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), who reported the assembly of unanchored polyUb chains in a manner that depended on at least two factors in reticulocyte lysate (besides E1). We developed an assay for the synthesis of novel chains and applied it to characterize a specific E2 and an apparent E3(s), which cooperate in the assembly of Lys-29- and Lys-48-linked chains.

A purified recombinant hexahistidine-Ub-DHFR fusion protein (carrying a G76V mutation in the Ub moiety) was provided by J. Piotrowski (Johns Hopkins University); this fusion protein was produced from a modified version of pUbV76-V-eΔK-DHFRha (17Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

A set of pET3a plasmids specifying seven mutant Ubs, each one carrying a single lysine residue (other lysines mutated to arginine via AGA codons) and a lysine-less Ub, were provided by M.

The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21, harboring a helper plasmid that encodes the AGA-specific argU tRNA; the purified proteins were devoid of significant lysine misincorporation as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. 3J. You, R. E. Cohen, and C. M. Pickart (1999) BioTechniques, in press. Plasmids for producing Lys-to-Cys Ub mutants (K6C, K11C, K29C, and K63C) were from B. Krantz and K. Wilkinson (Emory University). Modified Ubs possessing only a single (S-aminoethylcysteine) conjugation site were prepared from Lys-to-Cys mutants as follows. First, all of the lysine residues of Ub (3 mg in 3 ml) were blocked by reductive N-methylation in 6 m urea (32Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The product was concentrated to ∼0.5 ml (Millipore Ultra-free 4) and dialyzed for at least 4 h in a SlideAlyzer (Pierce) against 1 liter of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (5% base), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT (5 °C). The dialyzed sample was made 0.1 m in Tris-HCl (50% base) and treated with 55 mm ethyleneimine (Chemservice) for 1 h at 37 °C. The product was subjected to repeated rounds of concentration and dilution (with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT) until [DTT] exceeded [ethyleneimine]. Recovery of Ub ranged from 40 to 70%. Rabbit reticulocyte fraction II, 10–15 mg of protein, was fractionated by stepwise elution using a 1-ml MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (5% base), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmDTT (MonoQ buffer). The column was eluted sequentially with 2-ml portions of MonoQ buffer containing increasing concentrations of NaCl: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m. Each 2-ml fraction was collected in a Centricon-10 (Amicon) containing 0.2 mg ovalbumin (as carrier); the buffer was exchanged by repeated dilution with MonoQ buffer (final volume, ∼0.2 ml/fraction). The 0.4 m NaCl eluate was further fractionated by size exclusion chromatography on a calibrated 0.7 × 25-cm column of Sephacryl-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (5% base), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.2 mg/ml ovalbumin (33Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.27 ml were collected into plastic tubes, and a 4-μl aliquot of each fraction was assayed for UbcH5A-dependent Ub2synthesis (see “UB2 Synthesis Assay,” below). The fractions representing the peak of activity were pooled and concentrated, or in some cases, only the peak fraction was used. The Sephacryl-200 peak served as the source of E3 except where stated otherwise. For the experiment shown in Fig. 5 C, the enzyme was prepared by a modified procedure. The peak from anion exchange chromatography (above) was applied to a column of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm DTT. After washing with buffer containing 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm DTT, the column was eluted with 4 volumes of buffer containing 0.2 mpotassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm DTT. The latter fraction was concentrated. Solid ammonium sulfate was then added to 35% saturation; precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and dialyzed into MonoQ buffer (above). A rabbit E2 preparation enriched for Ubc5 was prepared as follows. Proteins precipitating between 0 and 55% saturation with ammonium sulfate were collected from rabbit reticulocyte fraction I, dialyzed against MonoQ buffer (above), and applied to an S-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with MonoQ buffer. The flow-through was discarded, and the column was eluted with three column volumes of MonoQ buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. S-Sepharose chromatography was necessary to remove Ub, which would otherwise interfere in the next step. Proteins in the eluate were precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against MonoQ buffer. The dialyzed eluate was supplemented with purified E1 (50 nm) and MgATP and chromatographed on a Ub-Sepharose column (26Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Covalently bound species were eluted with MonoQ buffer containing 5 mm DTT and 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration. The eluate contained a prominent protein of ∼16 kDa (presumptive Ubc5; see “Results”), which formed a thiol ester with Ub as well as a minor thiol ester-forming protein of a slightly higher molecular weight (not shown). The concentration of the presumptive Ubc5 was estimated based on the concentration of the 24-kDa 125I-Ub thiol ester band, as determined by comparison to the result obtained with a known amount of E2–25K (33Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET3a-UbcH5A (34Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) was provided by P. Howley (Harvard Medical School). UbcH5A was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS at 30 °C as described previously (35Li J. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 28: 6035-6041Google Scholar). Cell pellets were frozen overnight at −20 °C, then thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (33Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) using 2 ml of buffer/g of cells. Lysis and DNA digestion were carried out as described (33Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. Proteins precipitating between 50 and 80% saturation were collected and dialyzed against buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (5% base), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. The dialysate was passed through an S-Sepharose column (20 mg protein/ml resin) that had been equilibrated with S buffer containing 50 mm Tris (5% base), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. The column was washed with 2 volumes of the same buffer and then eluted with 4 volumes of the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. The 50 mm NaCl eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore Ultrafree-4) and chromatographed on a 1 × 46 cm Sephacryl-200 column equilibrated with S buffer. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and thiol ester assays were used to locate the peak of UbcH5A. E2–14K, E2–20K, and E2–35K were purified from rabbit reticulocytes (27Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant C170S-E2–25K (33Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and HsUbc13 (22Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Ub2 synthesis was assayed by combining purified E1 with an E2 source (fraction I, crude rabbit Ubc5, or purified recombinant UbcH5A) and an E3 source (see figure legends). Unless otherwise indicated, assays contained 0.3 μm E2 and 0.15 mg/ml E3 protein. Assays were initiated by adding a mix contributing 50 mm Tris-HCl (24% base, pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP (and a regenerating system), 0.3 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, ∼0.5 mm DTT, ∼0.1 μm E1, 1 mg/ml K48R-Ub74, and 2 μm125I-Ub (usually K48R). In some cases Ubal (1 μm) was added to inhibit isopeptidases (see figure legends). Reactions were incubated for times ranging from several min to 90 min (37 °C), quenched with sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Ub2 was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by band excision and γ-counting (or by phosphoimage analysis). The UbcH5A concentration dependence of E3 activity was investigated only in a preliminary way. The dependence was apparently hyperbolic, with a K0.5 of 50–100 nm. 4J. You and C. Pickart, unpublished data. The kinetically detected interaction of E2–14K and E3α follows a K0.5 of 70 to 200 nm (36Berleth E.S. Kasperek E.M. Grill S.P. Braunscheidel J.A. Graziani L.A. Pickart C.M.

Kinetic analysis of Ub2 synthesis was performed by varying the concentration of K48R-Ub74 in incubations of 60-min duration. Data were analyzed by plotting %Vmaxversus [K48R-Ub74]. In addition, log(%Vmax)/(1 - %Vmax)) was plotted against log[K48R-Ub74] to obtain the Hill parameters nH and Km,app. Incubations with E2–25K (see Fig. 5 A, “Results”) were carried out for 30 min at 2 mg/ml Ub and 20 μm C170S-E2–25K (pH 8, 37 °C) as described (33Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Incubations to assess linkage specificity in Ub2 synthesis by the E2/E3 were carried out at pH 7.3 and 37 °C under conditions described in the legend to Fig.5 B (see “Results”). Incubations to assess linkage specificity in polyUb chain synthesis by the E2/E3 were carried out at pH 7.3 and 37 °C as described in the legend to Fig. 5 C (see “Results”). In the first two cases, product formation was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. In the third case, a reaction aliquot was analyzed by Western analysis (ECL detection) with affinity-purified anti-Ub antibodies (38Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bamezai and Breslow (25Bamezai S. Breslow E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) report the synthesis of unanchored polyUb chains in a manner dependent on a factor(s) in fraction I (neutral/cationic proteins) and a factor(s) in fraction II (anionic proteins) of rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The requirement for fraction I indicated that these were not K48-linked chains assembled by the well characterized enzyme E2–25K, because E1 and E2–25K are both in fraction II (39Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address whether unanchored chains synthesized under these conditions (i.e. in fraction I plus fraction II) were linked through a lysine residue other than Lys-48, we used a polyUb chain assembly assay involving a low concentration of 125I-K48R-Ub and a high concentration of K48R-Ub74. The assay also contained purified E1. In this assay, competition effects will strongly favor the use of K48R-Ub74 (versus K48R-Ub) as the initiating Ub and counteract the formation of Ub3 and higher chains (since K48R-Ub74 lacks the C-terminal Gly-Gly dipeptide, it can only serve as the proximal Ub in the chain, i.e. as the donor of a lysine residue). Thus, Ub2 is formed in a manner that is linear versus time (e.g. Fig. 4, below). Moreover, since both Ub derivatives lack lysine at residue 48, the assay detects only novel dimers. Having Ub74 as the proximal Ub may also help to stabilize the Ub2 product against disassembly by isopeptidase T (40Wilkinson K.D. Tashayev V.L. O'Connor L.B. Larsen C.N. Kasperek E. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14535-14540Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), although we did not directly test the susceptibility of the novel chains to disassembly by deubiquitinating enzymes. Using this assay, we found that the synthesis of a 17-kDa125I-labeled product (presumptive Ub2) was strongly stimulated when we combined fraction I and fraction II (data not shown). Since fraction I is known to contain a number of E2s, including members of the Ubc5 subfamily (34Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 41Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar), we next determined whether fraction I could be replaced by a mixture of E2s purified from fraction I by Ub affinity chromatography. The E2 preparation contained a prominent 16-kDa protein(s) that formed a thiol ester with Ub (see “Experimental Procedures”). One or more Ubc5 homologs was present, based on the observation of a strong 16-kDa band in immunoblots developed with antibodies raised against Drosophila Ubc5 (data not shown). We will refer to this material as a crude Ubc5 preparation. Reconstitution assays revealed that this preparation contained an enzyme(s) that supported Ub2 synthesis in the absence of added fraction II (Fig. 1, lane 2). However, greater than additive synthesis of Ub2 was seen when the Ubc5 preparation was combined with fraction II (Fig. 1, lane 3 versus lanes 1 and 2). Because both Ub molecules in the assay carried the K48R mutation, this Ub2 product was atypically linked. The formation of high molecular weight conjugates was also strongly stimulated when the crude Ubc5 preparation was combined with fraction II (Fig. 1, lane 3). Presumably these large products reflect the conjugation of 125I-K48R-Ub to endogenous proteins in fraction II, catalyzed by endogenous E3s. Ubc5 isoforms are known to function with several different E3s (17Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar,42Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A.

These reconstitution studies showed that fraction I and fraction II each contained an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of a novel Ub2 product. The covalent affinity procedure used to generate the E2 preparation yielded an apparent rabbit Ubc5 homolog(s) (above). A simple interpretation of the reconstitution results is that Ub2 synthesis depended on a Ubc5 E2 contributed by fraction I and on an E3 contributed by fraction II. The experiments described below strongly support this interpretation. To further characterize the presumptive E3, fraction II was subjected to stepwise anion exchange fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 A shows that the putative chain-synthesizing E3 bound to the column (lane 1 versus lane 2) and eluted predomina"

In conjunction with the thyroid receptor (TR), CTCF binding to the lysozyme gene transcriptional silencer mediates the thyroid hormone response element (TRE)-dependent transcriptional repression. We tested whether other TREs, which in addition to the presence of a TR binding site require neighboring sequences for transcriptional function, might also contain a previously unrecognized binding site(s) for CTCF. One such candidate DNA region, previously isolated by Bigler and Eisenman (Bigler, J., and Eisenman, R. N. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 5710–5723), is the TRE-containing genomic element 144. We have identified a new CTCF target sequence that is adjacent to the TR binding site within the 144 fragment. Comparison of CTCF recognition nucleotides in the lysozyme silencer and in the 144 sequences revealed both similarities and differences. Several C-terminal CTCF zinc fingers contribute differently to binding each of these sequences. Mutations that eliminate CTCF binding impair 144-mediated negative transcriptional regulation. Thus, the 144 element provides an additional example of a functionally significant composite “TRE plus CTCF binding site” regulatory element suggesting an important role for CTCF in cooperation with the steroid/thyroid superfamily of nuclear receptors to mediate TRE-dependent transcriptional repression.

This multiple sequence specificity of CTCF is achieved through its ability to employ different groups of individual ZFs to recognize highly divergent sequences, and we have described CTCF as a multivalent factor (3Filippova G.N.

This divergence of DNA target sequences recognized by CTCF makes it difficult to predict CTCF binding sites by sequence homology.

We have identified a new CTCF binding site within the 144 DNA fragment some 160 bp away from the TRE that exhibits different sequence specificity compared with previously characterized CTCF sites. We show that the triiodothyronine (T3)-mediated transcriptional repression displayed by the 144 element is critically dependent on CTCF binding to this site. These observations indicate that the TRE-containing element 144 provides a second example of the synergistic, functional connection between a subset of certain CTCF target sites and T3-responsive negative regulatory elements. Two consecutive DNA fragments, 144#1 and 144#2, covering DNA sequences upstream and downstream of the 144 TRE as shown in Fig.1, were PCR amplified from the p144BS template and simultaneously 5′-end labeled at either strand by using two pairs of primers (one of which was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase): 5′-TCGTGTCCACCTAGTACAGCACATGCCTTG-3′ with the M13 reverse primer at the pBluescript polylinker (for the 144#1 fragment) and 5′-TAGATGTGCATAATCTATATAATCATCATT-3′ with 5′-GGAAATGTGTATGTACATGTGGTTGAGCGGTGCCTG-3′ (for the 144#2 fragment). A positive control DNA fragment bearing the CTCF binding sequence F1 of the S-2.4 transcriptional silencer from the chicken lysozyme gene (4Burcin M. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D.

Binding reactions for EMSA were carried out in the buffer containing standard phosphate-buffered saline with 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmZnSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol in the presence of cold double-stranded competitors, namely poly(dI-dC) plus poly(dG)·poly(dC) plus the 44-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-CTAGAGCCCCTCGGCCGCCCCCTCGCGGCGCGCCCTCCCCGCTT-3′ (1Lobanenkov V.V.

These oligonucleotide competitors markedly reduce a nonspecific binding in our EMSA experiments, because Sp1-, Egr-like proteins, and “G-string”-binding factors can bind to short GC-rich segments within the extended CTCF binding site, and this can obscure CTCF binding to its site (1Lobanenkov V.V.

EMSA reaction mixtures of a 20 μl final volume were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer as described previously (3Filippova G.N.

Therefore for human cell nuclear extract Ab2 antibodies serve as a negative control for the Ab1 anti-CTCF antibodies. Methylation interference (for guanines) and missing contact (for C and T nucleotides) analyses were carried out as described previously (3Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y.

For generating in vitro translated proteins we utilized the TnT® Reticulocyte Lysate coupled in vitro Transcription-Translation System (Promega Co., Madison, WI). Human CTCF cDNA fragments with a Bam HI site at the 5′-end and a Sac I site at the 3′-end were PCR generated with the template being the p7.1 CTCF cDNA (3Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M.

These PCR fragments were then in-frame ligated to the Bam HI-Sac I ends of the parental vector pCITE-4a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) under the EMC viral cap Independent Translational Enhancer, the CITE (12McCormick M. Mierendorf R. inNovations. 1994; 1: 4-6Google Scholar). Altogether 12 plasmids for expression of the serially truncated zinc finger forms of the CTCF DNA binding domain were generated. The pCITE4a-ZF(1–11) vector contains the reading frame of the full-length 11-zinc-finger domain from amino acid (aa) position 236 to 622 of the human CTCF protein (3Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S.

A number of N-terminal truncated ZF forms are encoded in the pCITE4a-ZF(2–11), beginning at the middle of the ZF1 at position 275 and ending at aa 622; in the pCITE4a-ZF(3–11), aa 307–622; pCITE4a-ZF(4–11), aa 332–622; in the pCITE4a-ZF(5–11), aa 367–622; and in the pCITE4a-ZF- (6Baniahmad A.

The vectors encoding a number of the C-terminal truncated forms are as follows: pCITE4a-ZF(1–10), aa 236–549; pCITE4a-ZF(1–9), aa 236–520; pCITE4a-ZF(1–8), aa 236–492; pCITE4a-ZF(1–7), aa 236–463; pCITE4a-ZF(1–6), aa 236–433; and pCITE 4a-ZF(1–5), aa 236–404. Complete maps and sequences of these constructs are available upon request. Translation products, synthesized in the presence of 35S E. coli hydrolysate labeling reagent containing ∼70%l-methionine (Trans35S-Label, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA), were analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis and visualized and quantitated by fluorography of a scintillant impregnated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with x-ray film (Bio-Max MR, Eastman Kodak) essentially as described previously (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The p144BS plasmid contains the 144 genomic clone obtained by immunoprecipitation of solubilized chromatin with a TR-specific antiserum, whereas the p tk 144UTR-CAT reporter plasmid contains the 144 element cloned into the Hpa I site of the pGLCAT4 reporter as described previously (10Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7621-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5710-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis in the p tk 144 UTR-CAT plasmid to alter the CTCF binding site (Fig. 4) was carried out with the Quik Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of the correctly mutated site and orientation of the DNA sequence of the 144 element in the original construct (Fig. 1) were verified by DNA sequencing. For both transient and stable transfections three CAT reporters driven by the TK promoter were utilized including the parental pGLCAT4 plasmid and the wild type and CTCF binding site-mutated p tk 144UTR-CAT vectors (Fig. 1). The promoterless plasmid pBLCAT3 (14Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) was used to determine the nonspecific background CAT signal. To obtain cell lines with different CAT plasmids stably incorporated into chromatin, DNA was transfected by CaPO4 precipitation into C2C12 mouse myoblasts grown to 30–50% confluence on 10-cm dishes using 10 μg of each of the CAT reporter plasmids and 1 μg of the pSV2Neo. Selection of G418-resistant clones and the establishment of polyclonal mass cultures were performed as described previously (3Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Stably transfected C2C12 cells growing at approximately equal density in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Sigma) were either induced for 24 h with 200 nm T3 from a stock solution of T3 dissolved in Me2SO or mock-induced with an equal volume of Me2SO (control), and whole cell extracts were prepared for CAT analysis. The relative number of stably integrated reporter constructs/cell in C2C12 mass cultures bearing the wild type or the mutated pTK144UTR-CAT plasmid was determined by Southern blot analysis utilizing as a probe the ∼3-kilobase pair Eco RI fragment from the pGLCAT4 vector together with an internal gel-loading control probe (the single copy mouse C/EBPα gene), both labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as described (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Direct phosphoimage analysis of the Southern blots indicated that the relative amount of each integrated CAT reporter in one versus the other mass culture was essentially equal (data not shown). Transient co-transfection experiments were carried out essentially as described (15Klenova E.M. Fagerlie S. Filippova G.N. Kretzner L. Goodwin G.H. Loring G. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. J. Biol.

Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7621-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5710-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells and green monkey kidney fibroblasts were plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates at 2 × 105 cells/well and cultured in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (Sigma). Transfection was performed the following day by standard CaPO4 precipitation with 4 μg of an indicated CAT reporter and 2 μg of each effector vector in triplicate. The following day cells were transferred to fresh medium in the presence or absence of 200 nm T3 for an additional 24 h before harvest. In both stable and transient transfection experiments, CAT protein levels were measured in whole cell extracts and prepared from an equal number of transfected cells utilizing the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with anti-CAT antibodies prebound to microtiter plates according to the manufacturer (CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit 1363727, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CAT values were normalized to total protein and in the case of stably transfected cells to the relative number of the integrated reporter plasmid. To determine whether there was a new CTCF binding site within the 144 TRE, we performed EMSA utilizing two 5′-end-labeled PCR-amplified DNA fragments, 144#1 and 144#2 (Fig.1 B) incubated with the in vitro translated 11-ZF CTCF domain. Fig.2 demonstrates that one of these DNA fragments (144#1) turned out to be positive for binding to the 11-ZF CTCF domain, indicating the presence of a new CTCF binding site positioned within a 200-bp region upstream of the 144 TRE (Fig. 1). To determine which nucleotides within fragment 144#1 are required for specific recognition by the 11-ZF CTCF domain, we carried out methylation interference (for guanines) and missing contact (for pyrimidines) analyses (Fig. 3). The disposition map for these contact nucleotides in both DNA strands defines the 144 CTCF binding site as indicated in Fig. 1 D. It contains an inverted repeat of the CCCTC motif that has previously been found in some but not all CTCF binding sites (1Lobanenkov V.V. Nicolas R.H. Adler V.V. Paterson H. Klenova E.M.

The 144#1 DNA fragment, 5′-end-labeled at either strand as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was subjected to methylation interference analysis (lane G, with DNA probes partially methylated at guanines with dimethyl sulfate) or missing nucleoside analysis (lane C+T, with DNA probes modified at pyrimidine bases with hydrozine). Lane F shows free DNA probes separated from the CTCF-bound probes (lane B).Closed and open circles on the side of each panel show guanine and pyrimidine DNA bases, respectively, which when missing from the labeled DNA strand or modified reduce or eliminate the binding of CTCF. These bases are shown in Fig. 1 D within the 144 CTCF-binding sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This novel CTCF binding site and the 144 TRE are positioned at a 160-bp distance from each other (Fig. 1). A gel shift analysis with the 144 fragment incubated with in vitro translated TR/RXR and CTCF indicated that both bind simultaneously to this fragment without any evidence of cooperativity or competition (data not shown). We have previously observed CTCF binding to the F1 sequence of the S-2.4 lysozyme gene transcriptional silencer that is required for optimal regulation by the thyroid hormone and/or retinoic acid receptors and have mapped the F1 CTCF contact nucleotides (4Burcin M.

Cell. 1990; 61: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). An alignment of the F1 and 144 CTCF binding sites reveals both subregional differences and similarities (Fig. 4). To determine which of the CTCF zinc fingers are involved in binding the 144 site versus the F1 site, we constructed a number of plasmids for in vitro translation of serially truncated forms of the 11-zinc-finger domain (see “Experimental Procedures”) and used the in vitro produced proteins (Fig.5 C) in EMSA experiments with the F1 and 144#1 DNA fragments. Fig. 5 demonstrates that different CTCF ZFs are involved in the binding of these two sequences. Deleting ZFs 11, 11+10, and 11+10+9 does not interfere with binding to the F1 site (Fig. 5 B) but markedly interferes with binding to the 144 site (Fig. 5 A). In contrast contribution of the N-terminal CTCF ZFs appears equally important in binding both F1 and 144 sites. (Fig. 5, A and B). We wished to determine whether the 144 site identified with the in vitro translated CTCF also bound endogenous CTCF. We performed the EMSA-utilizing nuclear extracts from HL-60 cells and the 144#1 DNA fragment. We observed a shifted band corresponding to the CTCF·DNA complex formed by the endogenous CTCF from the nuclear extract (Fig. 6, lane 2) with similar electrophoretic mobility as that generated by the in vitro translated CTCF (Fig. 6, lane 5). These bands disappeared with the addition of anti-CTCF antibodies (Ab1) but not control antibodies (Ab2) (Fig. 6, compare lanes 3 with 4 and lanes 6 with 7). Thus the 144 CTCF target sequence specifically interacts with the endogenous CTCF protein present in nuclear extracts. Moreover, under our EMSA conditions CTCF appears to represent the most abundant nuclear protein binding to the 144#1 sequence. As described previously the TRE-containing genomic DNA fragment 144 regulates transcription in a T3-dependent manner in transfected rat pituitary GH4 cells (10Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7621-7632Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 11Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5710-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 144 TRE flanking sequences resulted in a complete loss of the 144 transcriptional effects (11Bigler J. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5710-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggesting that an additional factor binding in the vicinity of the TRE is required to regulate the T3-mediated transcription. To test whether CTCF is the additional factor involved in the TRE-mediated 144 element function, we introduced a mutation within the 144#1 fragment that selectively eliminated CTCF binding. We substituted GAGGG for GAATT, which eliminated three CTCF-contacting guanines and conveniently created a unique Ase 1 restriction site allowing us to verify accuracy of the site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4). This mutated fragment no longer binds to either endogenous CTCF from nuclear extracts or in vitro translated CTCF (Fig. 6, lanes 9–16). Moreover, the absence of any shifted bands in EMSA with this mutated fragment indicates that it does not harbor any fortuitously created binding sites for any other DNA-binding factors. In addition we found in gel shift analyses with in vitro translated TR/RXR and CTCF proteins that the “Ase 1” mutation of the 144 CTCF binding site had no effect on TR/RXR binding to the 144 TRE (data not shown). We then transiently co-transfected CV-1 cells with the parental p tk-CAT construct harboring no 144 element, with the p tk 144UTR-CAT constructs with or without the Ase 1 mutation of the CTCF binding site, together with expression vectors for all three proteins likely involved in mediating the 144 function including CTCF, TR, and RXR. We observed that the activity of the TK promoter-driven CAT construct is down-regulated by the presence of the 144 element, and this down-regulation is enhanced with the addition of T3 (Fig. 7 A). This repression was considerably relieved with the reporter harboring the mutated 144 CTCF binding site, and this construct no longer responded to the addition of T3 (Fig. 7 A). We also performed stable transfection experiments in mouse myoblast C2C12 cells. These cells exhibit enhanced muscle differentiation with the addition of T3 (19Muscat G.E. Mynett-Johnson L. Dowhan D.

Soluble extracellular granzyme A has been shown to stimulate interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes, presumably via a membrane receptor that is different from the thrombin receptor (18Sower L.E.

Immunol. 1996; 171: 159-163Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These extracellular actions of granzyme A appear to be controlled by a highly abundant plasma inhibitor, ATIII, which can inactivate circulating granzyme A levels rapidly (20Masson D. Tschopp J. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).GzmK (granzyme 3, lymphocyte tryptase-2) was first discovered and purified as a second Z-Lys-SBzl-cleaving esterase in lymphokine-activated killer cells (21Hameed A.

It differed from human granzyme A with respect to its amino acid sequence and monomeric structure under nonreducing conditions (21Hameed A. Lowrey D.M. Lichtenheld M. Podack E.R. J.

Schmidt B.F. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 27: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).

Biochem. 1998; 27: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) by secretion and transport of precursor forms carrying signal sequences. To overcome various problems with these systems, we have developed a procedure that utilizes inclusion bodies (IB) from E. coli as the starting material for in vitro refolding. Amino-terminally extended and catalytically inactive precursors of GzmK were refolded into soluble proteins and then subjected to limited proteolysis by reaction with a dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase, cathepsin C, which appeared to be suitable to remove selectively extra amino acid residues at the amino terminus that are not present in catalytically active GzmK.We hypothesized that human GzmK, as the closest structural and functional relative of human granzyme A, could also be controlled by extracellular fluid phase inhibitors, and thus we investigated the inhibitory capacity of candidate inhibitors from human plasma. Our search for efficient inhibitors was guided by previous observations that mouse granzyme A, a major Z-Lys-SBzl esterase of lymphocytes, is inhibited by ATIII (20Masson D. Tschopp J. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and that aprotinin, a Kunitz-type inhibitor of bovine pancreas, is inhibitory toward human GzmK (24Babe L.M. Yoast S. Dreyer M. Schmidt B.F. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 27: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The major Kunitz-type inhibitor of human plasma, known as inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (IαI) according to its electrophoretic mobility between α1 and α2 plasma proteins, however, is a mixture of various complexes between bikunin (which consists of two Kunitz-type inhibitor domains) and H2 or H3 or H1 and H2 of the three structurally related polypeptide chains H1 to H3 (29Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). IαI occurs in concentrations between 0.4 and 0.7 mg/ml plasma, whereas free bikunin represents only about 2% of total plasma bikunin (30Slota A. Sjoquist M. Wolgast M. Alston-Smith J. Fries E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Salier J.-P. Sesboüé R. Vercaigne D. Bourguignon J. Martin J.-P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we report that IαI is the most important physiological GzmK inhibitor of human plasma and that its inhibitory activity is mediated by the second carboxyl-terminal domain of bikunin.DISCUSSIONPurification of catalytically active granzyme A was previously reported following periplasmic expression in E. coli (28Beresford P.J. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Lieberman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9285-9290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This approach has certain limitations and drawbacks. Not only are some granzymes bactericidal but translocation of the serine protease to the periplasmic space results in exposure to periplasmic bacterial proteases. Moreover, the export and signal peptide cleavage capacity is often exhausted in periplasmic expression systems yielding a mixture of folded and unfolded recombinant protein in the bacterial lysate. In contrast, expression yields are often very high with cytosolic expression vectors. The formation of inclusion bodies not only protects the bacteria from the toxic effects of the biologically active enzyme but also protects the recombinant protein from degradation by cytosolic bacterial proteases.A correctly engineered amino terminus starting with I(I/V)GG is essential for a granzyme to adopt its active conformation. The amino-terminal methionine, however, is only removed by the endogenous MAP when small-sized amino acid residues like glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, valine, or proline follow at the second position (34Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Our initial attempts to overcome this problem for GzmK were unsuccessful. Valine naturally occurs at the amino terminus of some serine proteases and was thus considered as a suitable replacement of the first Ile residue. However, when we replaced Ile to facilitate removal of amino-terminal Met residues (34Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), over 90% of recombinant molecules still carried the Met residue as shown by amino-terminal sequencing. After refolding of this protein preparation, we observed little enzymatic activity suggesting that the vast majority of the recombinant enzyme was catalytically inactive. Recovery of some enzymatic activity, corresponding with the minor fraction of biosynthetically converted GzmK, however, indicates that a Val at the amino terminus could functionally replace the natural Ile in GzmK.To generate highly homogeneous starting material for GzmK, we attached the prosequences Met-Gly-Glu and Met-Glu to its amino terminus. When the methionine was followed by a Gly, the amino-terminal methionine was removed in about 70% of refolded protein by MAP during biosynthesis of inclusion bodies. The refolded precursors for GzmK thus started with the propeptide sequence Gly-Glu as present in granzyme B or to a lesser extent with Met-Gly-Glu. In contrast, when the methionine was followed by Glu, the starting methionine remained associated with the polypeptide chain. Whereas the dipeptide Gly-Glu was shown to be efficiently removed from the amino terminus of granzyme B by cathepsin C in vitro (27Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar), removal of the natural propeptide of GzmK, Met-Glu, by cathepsin C had not yet been investigated. Our observations now indicate that both dipeptides attached to GzmK are efficiently cleaved off in vitro by cathepsin C. Thus we conclude that GzmK and granzyme B are most likely activated by the same processing enzyme in vivo. Since about 30% of all precursor molecules of the Met-Gly-Glu-construct still carried Met at the first position, the extension sequence Met-Glu was the most appropriate and the perfect solution to generate structurally homogeneous starting material.In this way, folding and conversion of the Met-Glu-precursor in vitro closely mimic the natural generation of granzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum after cleavage of the signal peptide. This particular feature of our protocol may explain the high folding yields and the efficient processing of the recombinant protein in vitro. The procedure described here is the first that enables the preparation of active human GzmK and its natural precursor from aggregated E. coli inclusion bodies by refolding and exopeptidolytic processing. The enzyme exhibits the same biochemical properties and specificities as biosynthetically folded GzmK purified from lymphokine-activated killer cells or supernatants of GzmK secreting B. subtilis (21Hameed A. Lowrey D.M. Lichtenheld M. Podack E.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3142-3147PubMed Google Scholar, 24Babe L.M. Yoast S. Dreyer M. Schmidt B.F. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1998; 27: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our procedure yields pure and active enzyme in the milligram range and, thus, overcomes problems of cost-intensive low level expression in mammalian cell lines.In view of the close structural and functional similarities between granzymes A and K and the previous observation that granzyme A is inhibited by ATIII (20Masson D. Tschopp J. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we first considered ATIII as the major inhibitor of GzmK in human plasma. In the absence of heparin, inhibition of GzmK by purified ATIII was slow, and the apparent association rate constant of 1.7 × 103m−1 s−1 was in the same order of magnitude as for granzyme A. However, inhibition of GzmK occurred with diluted plasma samples at ineffective ATIII concentrations and was independent of ATIII. Moreover, antibodies to ATIII did not change the kinetics of inhibition in human plasma indicating that ATIII is not the major inhibitor of GzmK in plasma.The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrated that IαI is the most important inhibitor for GzmK in human plasma. By using recombinant bikunin and Kunitz domain 2 of bikunin, we showed that the second Kunitz domain accounts for the inhibitory effect of IαI complexes. The equilibrium dissociation constant for GzmK and bikunin is in the same order of magnitude as has been found for other endogenous protease/inhibitor pairs including C1s/C1r and C1 inhibitor (35Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Thus inhibition by IαI is expected to be relevant at physiological concentrations.So far, endogenous physiological targets for human IαI have not been identified. Bikunin in IαI and free bikunin inhibits trypsin of the exocrine pancreas (36Potempa J. Kwon K. Chawla R. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15109-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acrosin from human sperm cells (39Sumi H. Toki N. Experientia (Basel). 1980; 36: 1103-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and plasmin (36Potempa J. Kwon K. Chawla R. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15109-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not factor Xa and plasma kallikrein. Blood coagulation factor Xa and plasma kallikrein are only recognized by the second Kunitz domain of bikunin but not by intact bikunin and IαI for steric reasons. Protease binding to the recognition loop of D2 is restrained by amino-terminal Kunitz-type domain D1 which most likely interacts with D2-bound small trypsin-like proteases and blocks binding of larger proteases (40Xu Y. Carr P.D. Guss J.M. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of the latter two enzymes with the isolated Kunitz domain 2 are nevertheless 20-fold higher (37Morishita H. Yamakawa T. Matsusue T. Kusuyama T. Sameshima-Aruga R. Hirose J. Nii A. Miura T. Isaji M. Horisawa-Nakano R. Thromb. Res. 1994; 73: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) than that for GzmK. So far, plasmin was the only enzyme of the interstitial and intravascular space that binds reasonably well to intact IαI complexes with a Ki value of 130 nm (36Potempa J. Kwon K. Chawla R. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15109-15114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin, however, is much faster and better controlled by its cognate inhibitor α2-antiplasmin than by IαI (35Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar), indicating that IαI is not a natural regulator of plasmin activity. As a result of these considerations and our new findings, we strongly suggest that lymphocyte-derived GzmK is a physiological target for IαI and free bikunin and is controlled by this plasma protein family.Inhibitors of human plasma and interstitial fluids restrict the extracellular actions of enzymes after their release or activation and thus prevent inappropriate effects on bystander cells and distant tissues. Granzymes that are controlled by fluid phase inhibitors are expected to act on substrates that are present on the surface of host cells or in the extracellular compartment. The existence of a potent GzmK-specific Kunitz-type inhibitor in human plasma supports the idea that GzmK fulfills additional extracellular functions besides its intracellular role in DNA fragmentation of target cells (22Shi L. Kam C.M. Powers J.C. Aebersold R. Greenberg A.H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1521-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In analogy to human granzyme A (41Parry M.A. Myles T. Tschopp J.

Perforin and granzymes are major components of cytosolic granules that play important roles in the secretory pathway of T and natural killer (NK)1 cell-mediated cytotoxicity against virally infected host cells, tumor cells, and antigenetically altered untransformed host cells. Upon specific target cell recognition granules are exocytosed toward the target cell membrane, and perforin and granzymes are released in concert (1Shresta S. Pham C.T. Thomas D.A. Graubert T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2139486841,"Homologous recombination and double-stranded DNA break repair in Escherichia coli are initiated by the multifunctional RecBCD enzyme. After binding to a double-stranded DNA end, the RecBCD enzyme unwinds and degrades the DNA processively. This processing is regulated by the recombination hot spot, Chi (χ: 5′-GCTGGTGG-3′), which induces a switch in the polarity of DNA degradation and activates RecBCD enzyme to coordinate the loading of the DNA strand exchange protein, RecA, onto the single-stranded DNA products of unwinding. Recently, a single mutation in RecB, Asp-1080 → Ala, was shown to create an enzyme (RecBD1080ACD) that is a processive helicase but not a nuclease. Here we show that the RecBD1080ACD enzyme is also unable to coordinate the loading of the RecA protein, regardless of whether χ sites are present in the DNA. However, the RecBD1080ACD enzyme does respond to χ sites by inactivating in a χ-dependent manner. These data define a locus of the RecBCD enzyme that is essential not only for nuclease function but also for the coordination of RecA protein loading.

West S.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 745-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RecBCD enzyme is heterotrimeric, being composed of the products from the recB, recC, and recD genes (for review see Ref. 2Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of these two enzymes is clearly illustrated by the behavior of their mutants; deletion of either the recB or recC gene reduces conjugal recombination proficiency by 100- to 1000-fold (3Howard-Flanders P. Theriot L. Genetics. 1966; 53: 1137-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Emmerson P.T. Genetics. 1968; 60: 19-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a recA null mutation reduces it approximately 100,000-fold (5Clark A.J. Margulies A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The central step in homologous recombination is catalyzed by RecA protein, which binds cooperatively to DNA and then promotes pairing and exchange between homologous DNA molecules (for review see Ref. 6Kowalczykowski S.C. Eggleston A.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 991-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). One requirement for this step, however, is that the donor DNA must possess a region of single-stranded character, because RecA protein binds poorly to dsDNA at physiological conditions. Initial binding of RecA protein is random, but subsequent cooperative binding extends the RecA nucleoprotein filament in the 5′ → 3′ direction (7Register III, J.C. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12308-12312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A result of this polar extension of the RecA nucleoprotein filament is that 3′-ssDNA ends are more likely to be coated with RecA protein than 5′-ssDNA ends and, therefore, are more recombinagenic (8Konforti B.B. Davis R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6916-6920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The processing of a dsDNA break into a form suitable for RecA protein binding is catalyzed by the RecBCD enzyme. The RecBCD enzyme is both a helicase and a nuclease, and it initiates recombinational repair from dsDNA ends. After binding to an end, RecBCD enzyme processively unwinds and degrades the DNA, unwinding up to 30 kilobase pairs per binding event (9Roman L.J. Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of the DNA is asymmetric, with the 3′-terminal strand being degraded much more vigorously than the 5′-terminal strand (10Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 361-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 87-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). DNA processing by the RecBCD enzyme is regulated by an eight-base DNA element, Chi (χ; 5′-GCTGGTGG-3′) (12Lam S.T. Stahl M.M. McMilin K.D. Stahl F.W. Genetics. 1974; 77: 425-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stahl F.W. Crasemann J.M. Stahl M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Smith G.R. Kunes S.M.

A. 1997; 94: 6706-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). χ was originally identified in vivo as a recombination hot spot that stimulates homologous recombination about 10-fold in its vicinity.In vitro analysis revealed that χ elicits this response by regulating a number of RecBCD enzyme activities. When a translocating RecBCD molecule recognizes a χ site, the enzyme pauses, and DNA degradation on the 3′-terminal strand is attenuated (10Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 361-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The enzyme then continues unwinding the DNA but now degrades the 5′-terminal strand preferentially (16Anderson D.G. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 17Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). On DNA molecules longer than the processive translocation length, processing by RecBCD enzyme creates a long, 3′ ssDNA overhang, which is both a common early intermediate in homologous recombination and an ideal substrate for RecA protein. In addition to regulating the nuclease properties of the RecBCD enzyme, χ also induces the RecBCD enzyme to coordinate the loading of RecA protein onto the ssDNA downstream of χ (18Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The initial binding of RecA protein to ssDNA is slow (19Chabbert M. Cazenave C. Helene C. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2218-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and RecA protein cannot compete efficiently with other ssDNA-binding proteins (20Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Kowalczykowski S.C. Clow J.C. Somani R. Varghese A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Facilitation of RecA protein binding to ssDNA by RecBCD enzyme overcomes this inhibition (18Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of in vitro recombination reactions using RecA protein, RecBCD enzyme and single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) protein established that these proteins catalyze efficient pairing between χ-containing dsDNA and homologous supercoiled DNA, forming a recombination intermediate known as a D-loop (10Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 361-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The domains responsible for the individual activities of the RecBCD enzyme are just starting to be elucidated. The RecBC enzyme (without the RecD subunit) is a very processive helicase but has no significant nuclease activity (16Anderson D.G. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Masterson C. Boehmer P.E. McDonald F. Chaudhuri S. Hickson I.D. Emmerson P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13564-13572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Korangy F. Julin D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the RecBC enzyme also coordinates the loading of RecA protein and that this loading is independent of χ. Instead, RecBC enzyme constitutively loads RecA protein onto the DNA strand that terminates 3′ at the dsDNA end at which RecBC enzyme entered (24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fact that RecBC enzyme has little nuclease activity indicates that the RecD subunit plays an essential role in DNA degradation. However, analysis of mutations in the RecB subunit establishes that the C-terminal domain of this enzyme is absolutely essential for all nuclease activities of the RecBCD enzyme (25Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fusion of the C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit with the DNA binding domain of T4 phage gene 32 protein creates a nonspecific nuclease, showing that the C terminus of RecB subunit is indeed a nuclease. Finally, a single point mutation in the putative Mg2+binding site of the RecB subunit, Asp-1080 → Ala, creates a holoenzyme (RecBD1080ACD) that behaves much like the RecBC enzyme; it is a processive helicase with no measurable nuclease activity. Here we show that despite being an efficient helicase, the RecBD1080ACD enzyme is unable to load RecA protein. This inability to load RecA protein is independent of whether the processed DNA contains χ sites. Although the RecBD1080ACD enzyme does not load RecA protein in response to χ, it can still recognize χ: χ-containing DNA is processed at a slower rate than DNA without χ. These data provide the first insight into the domain that is responsible for either 1) transmitting the χ recognition event into the enzymatic alterations that are necessary for proper RecBCD enzyme function or 2) RecA protein loading. RecBC enzyme was purified as described (24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RecBC enzyme concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 105m−1cm−1 at 280 nm, derived by adding the respective extinction coefficients for the individual subunits (23Korangy F. Julin D.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4873-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No contaminating protein bands were detected when 1 μg of protein was loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. RecBD1080ACD enzyme was a gift from D. A. Julin and M. Yu (University of Maryland) (26Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). E. coli SSB protein was isolated from strain RLM727 and purified according to LeBowitz (27LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda DNA Replication.Ph.D. thesis. The Johns Hopkins University, 1985Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 3.0 × 104 at 280 nm. RecA protein was purified using a procedure based on spermidine precipitation 2S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished data. (28Griffith J. Shores C.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 2.7 × 104m−1cm−1 at 280 nm. All restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. The enzymes were used according to Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) or as indicated by the vendor. The plasmids pBR322 χo (wild type) and pBR322 χ+F225 (14Smith G.R. Kunes S.M. Schultz D.W. Taylor A. Triman K.L. Cell. 1981; 24: 429-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) were prepared from strains S819 and S818, respectively, provided by G. R. Smith and A. F. Taylor. Plasmid pBR322 χ3F,3H was created by ligation of the oligonucleotide linker 5′-ATCTAGA CCACCAGC CAGCGCGTGT CCACCAGC TCAGCATCGA CCACCAGC TCGAGTGCA-3′ into the Pst I-Ase I site of pBR322 χo (Chi sites are shown in bold), followed by insertion of a linker 5′-GTCATTAAT GCTGGTGG GCGCAGACTC GCTGGTGG TCACATGGCG GCTGGTGG CTGCAG-3′ into the second (position 1480) Ppu MI site of the plasmid. All plasmid DNAs were purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The molar concentration of the dsDNA in nucleotides was determined using an extinction coefficient of 6290m−1 cm−1 at 260 nm. Plasmid DNA was linearized with Nde I and radioactively labeled at the 5′ end by sequential reactions with shrimp alkaline phosphatase followed by T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) using methods given by the vendor or by Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The coupled RecA-RecBCD reactions were conducted in the presence of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 8 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 4 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 40 μm (nucleotides) 5′ end-labeled Nde I-linearized dsDNA, 80 μm(nucleotides) supercoiled DNA, 20 μm RecA protein, 8 μm SSB protein, 2.25 nm total RecBD1080ACD enzyme (corresponding to 0.25 RecBD1080ACD enzyme molecules/linear dsDNA end), or 24.6 nm total RecBC enzyme (20% active, corresponding to 0.53 functional RecBC enzyme molecules/linear dsDNA end) (10Dixon D.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1991; 66: 361-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). RecBD1080ACD and RecBC enzyme concentrations were chosen to provide approximately equal amounts of helicase units. Assays were performed at 37 °C. Exonuclease protection assays were initiated by the addition of RecBC or RecBD1080ACD enzyme after preincubation of all standard components except supercoiled DNA for 2 min. After 3 min, a mixture of poly(dT) and ATPγS was added to a final concentration of 200 μm (nucleotides) and 5 mm, respectively. After 1 min of incubation, exonuclease I was added to a concentration of 100 units/ml (18Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unwinding reactions were performed in the presence of 25 mmTris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 or 8 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μm (nucleotides) linear (2.3 nm dsDNA ends) 5′ end-labeled dsDNA, and 2 μmSSB protein. Reactions were preincubated for 2 min at 37 °C followed by addition of RecBCD (0.046 nm) or RecBD1080ACD (0.23 nm) enzyme. Assays were performed at 37 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (20 μl) were taken at the indicated time points and added to 20 μl of stop buffer (0.125 m EDTA, 2.5% SDS, 10% Ficoll, 0.125% bromphenol blue, and 0.125% xylene cylanol) to halt the reaction and to deproteinize the sample. This was followed by the addition of 1.5 μl of 600 units/ml proteinase K and incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels for approximately 15 h at 1.4 V/cm in TAE (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried onto DE-81 paper (Whatman) and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager using Image-QuaNT software. Since RecBC enzyme is a helicase with no significant nuclease activity, processing of linear dsDNA by the RecBC enzyme produces two full-length ssDNA molecules. For convenience, we refer to the strand of DNA terminating 3′ at the entry point of RecBC or RecBCD enzyme as the “top-strand” and the complementary strand of DNA as the “bottom-strand” (Fig.1) (17Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that the RecBC enzyme coordinates the loading of RecA protein onto the top-strand of DNA during unwinding (24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This facilitated loading results in the efficient production of the RecA nucleoprotein complex, which mediates pairing between the top-strand DNA and a homologous supercoiled DNA to form joint molecules (24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Like RecBC enzyme, RecBD1080ACD enzyme possesses helicase activity but no significant nuclease activity (26Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, χ does not induce nuclease activity in either enzyme 3J. C. Churchill and S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished observations. (26Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, processing of linear DNA by either RecBD1080ACD or RecBC enzyme produces only full-length ssDNA. In Fig. 2, we tested the ability of RecBD1080ACD enzyme to process linear dsDNA into substrates suitable for joint molecule formation by RecA protein. Linear pBR322 χ+F (which contains a χ site) and homologous supercoiled DNA were incubated with RecA protein and SSB protein, and then either RecBD1080ACD enzyme or RecBC enzyme was added to start the reaction. After 2 min, the dsDNA was almost completely unwound by both RecBD1080ACD enzyme and RecBC enzyme (Fig.2). However, only 1% of the ssDNA produced by RecBD1080ACD enzyme was incorporated into a joint molecule. In contrast, 36% of the ssDNA produced by RecBC enzyme was incorporated into joint molecules after 2 min. In the next section, we show that this dramatic difference reflects an inability of RecBD1080ACD enzyme to load RecA protein. To test whether RecBD1080ACD enzyme can load RecA protein onto the ssDNA products of unwinding, we examined the sensitivity of these unwinding products to exonuclease I degradation (18Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). If the ssDNA products were coated with SSB protein, then they were sensitive to the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of exonuclease I (30Molineux I.J. Gefter M.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 811-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, if instead RecA protein was loaded onto the ssDNA, then they were resistant to exonuclease I after stabilization with ATPγS (18Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this assay, the linear dsDNA was 5′ end-labeled and incubated with RecA protein and SSB protein. Either RecBD1080ACD enzyme or RecBC enzyme was added and incubated for 3 min. Last, a mixture of excess poly(dT) and ATPγS was added. The addition of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATPγS, induced a high affinity DNA-binding state in RecA protein (31Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This stabilized any bound RecA protein, whereas the addition of excess poly(dT) sequestered the free RecA and SSB protein. After another minute of incubation, the presence of RecA or SSB protein on the 3′ ends of the ssDNA was detected by either protection or enhancement of exonuclease I degradation, respectively. Because wild-type RecBCD enzyme requires activation by χ to load RecA protein, we compared the RecA-loading properties of RecBD1080ACD enzyme with DNA either devoid of or containing χ (Fig. 3). RecA loading was examined using Nde I-linearized pBR322 χo (which has no χ sites; Fig. 3 A) and Nde I-linearized pBR322 χ3F,3H (which has 6 χ sites; Fig. 3 B). When χo DNA is unwound by RecBD1080ACD enzyme in the presence of RecA and SSB proteins, only 2% of the resultant ssDNA was resistant to exonuclease I degradation (Fig. 3 A, 10 min time point). In contrast, 48% of the ssDNA produced by RecBC enzyme is protected from exonuclease I. This pattern is unaffected by the presence of χ in the dsDNA; 6% of the ssDNA was protected when unwound by RecBD1080ACD enzyme, and 44% of the ssDNA was protected when unwound by RecBC enzyme. These data show that, as expected, RecBC enzyme loads RecA protein only onto the top-strand, since approximately one-half of the ssDNA was protected from exonuclease I digestion (24Churchill J.C. Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mutant RecBD1080ACD enzyme was completely defective in RecA loading, as defined by this 3′ end protection assay. Since the χ sites were not at the ends of the DNA tested, it was possible that RecBD1080ACD enzyme might have started loading RecA protein only after it reached a χ site. Had this been the case, cooperative binding would have rapidly extended the RecA nucleoprotein filament to the 3′ end of the top strand, resulting in exonuclease protection of the entire top-strand ssDNA molecule. Instead, no protection of either strand was observed. Alternatively, if RecA protein was loaded at χ, but extension of the nucleoprotein filament was inhibited for some unknown reason, exonuclease I degradation of the region of ssDNA upstream (3′) of χ would have produced a ssDNA fragment of the same size as the top-strand, downstream χ-specific fragment (see Fig. 1) (17Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). No fragments of this size were observed (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we conclude that the RecBD1080ACD enzyme cannot load RecA protein regardless of the presence of χ. In Fig. 3, we showed that the RecBD1080ACD enzyme is incapable of loading RecA protein, even when the DNA contains χ sites. One possible explanation for this failing is that χ recognition is required for activation of RecA loading, and the RecBD1080ACD enzyme cannot recognize χ. The traditional way to examine χ recognition in vitro is to examine the production of χ-specific ssDNA fragments. However, since the RecBD1080ACD enzyme lacks nuclease activity, it does not produce χ-specific fragments (26Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), (Fig. 3 B). Nevertheless, in the absence of χ-specific fragment formation, it is still possible to detect χ recognition using the phenomenon of χ-dependent inactivation. Under conditions of low free Mg2+, wild-type RecBCD enzyme is inactivated after encountering a χ site while translocating through dsDNA (32Dixon D.A. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate and extent for unwinding of χ-containing DNA by the RecBD1080ACD enzyme was examined at low free Mg2+ concentrations. The concentration of free Mg2+ was controlled by varying the relative concentrations of Mg2+ and ATP (33Eggleston A.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The unwinding of 5′ end-labeled Nde I-linearized pBR322 χo (which has no χ sites) was compared with unwinding of 5′ end-labeled Nde I-linearized pBR322 χ3F,3H (which has 6 χ sites). We observed that at all protein concentrations, the initial rates were approximately equal regardless of the presence of χ (Fig.4 A). However, the rate of unwinding of χ-containing DNA slowed later in the reaction. This difference was not as dramatic as that seen for wild-type RecBCD enzyme (Fig. 4 B), which was completely inactivated after encountering χ sequences during unwinding. Since the RecA-loading properties of the RecBD1080ACD enzyme were tested at a “high” (8 mm) concentration of magnesium ion, the inactivation reactions were repeated in the presence of 8 mm magnesium (Fig. 5). As expected from previous work (32Dixon D.A. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), wild-type RecBCD enzyme unwound both χ and non-χ-containing DNA completely, although the χ-containing DNA was unwound slightly slower. Surprisingly, the RecBD1080ACD enzyme was completely inactivated by the processing of χ-containing DNA. This reaction was repeated at several different protein concentrations with the same results; unwinding of linear dsDNA containing χ inactivates the RecBD1080ACD enzyme at high magnesium acetate concentrations (data not shown). These data show that the RecBD1080ACD enzyme can recognize χ, although this recognition leads to inactivation at high magnesium ion concentrations. The mechanism by which RecA protein is loaded onto ssDNA by RecBCD enzyme remains unclear. However, our analysis of the RecBD1080ACD enzyme reveals an important role for the RecB subunit in the mediation of RecA protein loading. We show that unlike the RecBC enzyme, which is also a processive helicase with no significant nuclease activity, the RecBD1080ACD enzyme cannot promote efficient D-loop formation in reconstituted recombination reactions (Fig. 2). Despite the absence of nuclease activity and the presence of helicase function, the RecBD1080ACD enzyme does not stimulate joint molecule formation even if χ is present in the DNA. This inability to promote D-loop formation results from an inability of RecBD1080ACD enzyme to load RecA protein onto the unwound ssDNA (Fig. 3). In contrast, RecBC protein promotes the loading of RecA protein onto about 50% of the resultant ssDNA, which is consistent with its ability to load RecA protein asymmetrically onto the top-strand of DNA during unwinding. Since χ recognition is required for RecA loading by wild-type RecBCD enzyme, one possible explanation for the inability of the RecBD1080ACD enzyme to load RecA protein is that it simply cannot recognize χ. To test this possibility, we examined whether RecBD1080ACD enzyme, like RecBCD enzyme, inactivates in response to χ. Using the χ-dependent inactivation assay, we established that unwinding by RecBD1080ACD enzyme is slowed in the presence of χ (Fig. 4). This effect is not as dramatic as that seen with wild-type RecBCD enzyme, which is completely inactivated by χ. Unexpectedly, the RecBD1080ACD enzyme is inactivated by χ in the presence of high Mg2+ (Fig.5). In contrast, processing of DNA by wild-type RecBCD enzyme was only slightly slower when the DNA contained χ sites. These results establish that RecBD1080ACD enzyme can indeed recognize χ, although its response to χ is somewhat different than for the wild-type enzyme. Inactivation of RecBCD enzyme in response to χ at low concentrations of Mg2+ does not cause the enzyme to dissociate from the DNA at χ (32Dixon D.A. Churchill J.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2980-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rather, RecBCD enzyme continues to process the DNA until it reaches the end of the DNA molecule; however, this χ-modified enzyme is unable to re-initiate unwinding on another DNA molecule. Examination of RecBD1080ACD enzyme products after exonuclease treatment (Fig. 3) suggests that RecBD1080ACD enzyme does not dissociate at χ either. If RecBD1080ACD enzyme had dissociated at χ, a Y-shaped, partially unwound dsDNA structure would have formed. The subsequent degradation by exonuclease I would have resected the 3′-terminating ssDNA strand, thereby producing dsDNA with a 5′ overhanging end. DNA of this type would be resistant to both RecBCD enzyme and exonuclease I (17Anderson D.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and hence, stable, but no intermediates of this type were observed. Thus, in this sense, the inactivation of RecBD1080ACD enzyme observed at high Mg2+ is similar to that observed by RecBCD enzyme at low Mg2+; recognition of χ does not appear to cause dissociation of the RecBD1080ACD enzyme from the DNA. Rather, χ-induced inactivation prevents the enzyme from starting a new round of DNA processing. As previously mentioned, Asp-1080 in RecB protein was originally characterized as an essential component of the nuclease domain (26Yu M. Souaya J. Julin D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Comparison with other nucleases suggested that it is required for binding of Mg2+ in the active site. Weaker binding of Mg2+ by RecBD1080ACD enzyme can explain the χ-dependent inactivation observed at an unexpectedly high concentration of Mg2+ (Fig. 5). More importantly, however, our data illuminate a previously unknown additional role for this domain by establishing that it is also required for RecA protein loading. Even though RecBD1080ACD enzyme can recognize χ by at least one measure and can continue unwinding past the χ site, it is unable to load RecA protein onto the resultant ssDNA. We believe there are two molecular interpretations of this data. 1) Asp-1080 in RecB is required to transmit the χ-recognition signal to whatever element is responsible for RecA protein loading, or 2) Asp-1080 is an essential component of the RecA protein-loading machinery. Consistent with our observation that the C-terminal domain of the RecB subunit is important for RecA protein loading, analysis of the truncated RecB1–929C enzyme, which has 30 kDa deleted from the C terminus, shows that it is also an efficient helicase that cannot load RecA protein. 4J. J. Churchill and S. C. Kowalczykowski, submitted for publication. In addition, recent characterization of the RecB(Thr807Ile)CD enzyme (also known as RecB2109CD enzyme) shows that it too is unable to load RecA protein. 5D. A. Arnold and S. C. Kowalczykowski, submitted for publication. Thus, it is clear that the RecB subunit plays a central role in the loading of RecA protein onto ssDNA. It remains unclear what role RecD subunit plays in RecA protein loading. RecBC enzyme loads RecA protein constitutively, whereas RecBD1080ACD enzyme cannot load RecA protein at all. One interpretation of these results is that the RecD subunit represses the RecA protein-loading activities of the RecBCD enzyme, and only following its inactivation is RecA protein-loading manifest. However, this simple interpretation is complicated by the observation that RecB1–929C enzyme cannot load RecA protein either. This shows that mutations in the RecB subunit can directly affect the RecA protein-loading properties of the enzyme. It will be interesting to test the RecA protein-loading properties of RecBD1080AC enzyme to further clarify the controlling role of the RecD subunit. The exact nature of the facilitated loading of RecA protein and its relationship to the nuclease activity of the RecB subunit remains to be determined. We are especially grateful to Doug Julin and Misook Yu for sharing their results before publication and particularly for their generous gift of RecBD1080ACD enzyme. We also thank the many members of the Kowalczykowski laboratory for their critical reading of this material: Richard Ando, Deana Arnold, Carole Bornarth, Piero Bianco, Frédéric Chédin, Frank Harmon, Julie Kleiman, Jim New, Erica Seitz, and Susan Shetterley."
https://openalex.org/W1986889483,"Previous studies have shown that drugs which bind in the DNA minor groove reduce the curvature of bent DNA. In this article, we examined the effects of these drugs on the nucleosome assembly of DNA molecules that display different degrees of intrinsic curvature. DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) inhibited the assembly of a histone octamer onto a 192-base pair circular DNA fragment from Caenorhabditis elegans and destabilized a nucleosome that was previously assembled on this segment. The inhibitory effect was highly selective since it was not seen with nonbent molecules, bent molecules with noncircular shapes, or total genomic DNA. This marked template specificity was attributed to the binding of the ligand to multiple oligo A-tracts distributed over the length of the fragment. A likely mechanism for the effect is that the bound ligand prevents the further compression of the DNA into the minor groove which is required for assembly of DNA into nucleosomes. To further characterize the effects of the drug on chromatin formation, a nucleosome was assembled onto a 322-base pair DNA fragment that contained the circular element and a flanking nonbent segment of DNA. The position of the nucleosome along the fragment was then determined using a variety of nuclease probes including exonuclease III, micrococcal nuclease, DNase I, and restriction enzymes. The results of these studies revealed that the nucleosome was preferentially positioned along the circular element in the absence of DAPI but assembled onto the nonbent flanking sequence in the presence of the drug. DAPI also induced the directional movement of the nucleosome from the circular element onto the nonbent flanking sequence when a nucleosome preassembled onto this template was exposed to the drug under physiologically relevant conditions. Previous studies have shown that drugs which bind in the DNA minor groove reduce the curvature of bent DNA.

Nucleosomes are often located at discrete sites in regions of chromatin that regulate transcription and replication and this nonrandom positioning is thought to play a key role in controlling the accessibility of DNA sequence elements to protein regulatory factors. Nucleosome positioning in genome control regions is also a dynamic process. Changes in nucleosome arrangement including disruption, unfolding, and short-range lateral mobility have been related to changes in gene activity and replication function in a variety of systems (1Van Holde K.E.

Thus, the ability to disrupt or to direct the movement of a specific nucleosome type would provide a method that could be used to further understand the significance of these events and the multifunctional roles of the nucleosome. Drugs that bind to DNA frequently alter the patterns of transcription and replication. Consequently, there has been a tremendous effort devoted to describing drug-DNA interactions with the aim of understanding the mechanisms that are involved in promoting these changes in the cell. It is often difficult to relate results from in vitro studies that focus on ligand-DNA interactions to pharmacological effects seen in vivo since the DNA in the nucleus is packaged into chromatin. Many studies have shown that chromatin packaging directs sites of drug binding since chromatin accessible regions such as nucleosome linker DNA and the outer facing surface of nucleosomal DNA are preferred targets for drug interactions (see Refs. 14Pazin M.J. Bhargava P. Geiduschek E.P. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1997; 276: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Cairns M.J. Murray V.

Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1175-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and references therein). Similarly, chromatin accessible regions are preferred cleavage sites for antitumor glycoprotein antibiotics and are hot spots for the formation of photoproducts produced by UV light (17Suquet C. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23755-23757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cairns M.J. Murray V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8753-8760Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, little is known about selective changes in chromatin structure that might occur upon drug binding, although such changes are likely to be important in the mechanism of action of these compounds. Classical intercalators such as ethidium bromide display little or no sequence specificity (19Fox K.R. Waring M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 491-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) which limits their use as selective probes in chromatin structural studies. Intercalation of ring systems into the DNA duplex also leads to gross changes in helical structure which produces marked changes in the structure of all nucleosomes and the nonspecific disruption of higher-order chromatin conformations (20Chaires J.B. Dattagupta N. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,21McMurray C.T. Van Holde T.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5644-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Drugs that bind in the DNA minor groove display a degree of sequence specificity in that they preferentially bind to short oligo(A) sequences (reviewed in Refs. 22Zimmer C. Wahnert U. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1986; 47: 31-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar and 23Geierstanger B.H. Wemmer D.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 463-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The specificity of these drugs for bent DNA may also be enhanced by the cooperative drug binding to multiple closely spaced oligo A-tracts that characterize these sequences (24Eriksson S. Kim S.K. Kubista M. Nordén B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These drugs bind to pre-existing structures, the narrow minor grooves, which are complementary to the structures of the ligands. Consequently, in contrast to intercalators, these drugs cause little distortion in the DNA duplex and their effects on chromatin structure appear more subtle. Minor groove binders have been reported to interact preferentially with AT-rich linker regions in chromatin, thereby promoting the selective dissociation of histone Hl (25Käs E. Poljak L. Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This effect is presumably responsible for the drug-induced decondensation of higher order structures of AT-rich regions of chromatin, which has been analyzed by both biochemical and microscopic methods (25Käs E. Poljak L. Adachi Y. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Sen D. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1503-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 27Radic M.Z. Lundgren K. Hamkalo B.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 1101-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Some of these drugs have also been reported to promote the rotation of the DNA on the surface of the nucleosome (28Low C.M.L. Drew H.R. Waring M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6785-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Pérez J.J. Portugal J.

However, it has generally been assumed that the nucleosome core is resistant to disruption by these compounds although, to our knowledge, their effects on assembly of the nucleosome have not been assessed. In this article, we present an analysis of the influence of a minor groove binding drug on the nucleosome assembly of DNA molecules that display different degrees of intrinsic curvature. The results of this study show that the drug exhibits a marked template selectivity for inhibiting nucleosome formation and for promoting the disruption of assembled nucleosomes. The DNA sequence and structural requirements for this selectivity are also described. Standard molecular biological techniques were used for DNA manipulations (31Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DR36 containing a segment of the RNA polymerase II gene (32Bird D.M.

Subclones from this plasmid containing the circular intron D and nonbent exon segments were inserted into the Eco RI site of pUC18 as described previously (33Albert F.G. Bronson E.C. Fitzgerald D.J.

Simpson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15318-15324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Robert Simpson and subcloned into the Eco RI site of pUC18. The synthetic DNAs used in Figs. 1, 3, and 4 were stepwise assembled from synthetic oligonucleotide precursors and inserted into the Eco RI-Hin dIII sites of pUC18 (36Fitzgerald D.J. Anderson J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Each of these recombinants contains the same two 40-bp1 bending elements that are separated by variable amounts of nonbent DNA as indicated in Fig.4. The two recombinants used in this study are designated pSyn 20 and pSyn 47. Complete sequences of these fragments are presented elsewhere (36Fitzgerald D.J. Anderson J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The high ionic strength electrophoretic analysis described in the text was carried out using an 8% polyacrylamide (PA) gels run for 3 days at 4 °C with buffer recirculation at 30 V in Tris acetate-EDTA(TAE) buffer with or without 0.6 m NaCl.Figure 3A, DAPI-sensitive stages during nucleosome assembly.

Samples were applied to a nitrocellulose sheet and washed 5 times with the same NaCl levels prior to autoradiography.B, reconstitution reactions containing intron and exon segments were adjusted to 10 μm DAPI during dilution from 1 to 0.1 m NaCl.

Histone octamers were assembled onto all templates in the absence of the drug. The templates in A consisted of two 48-bp segments of synthetic bent DNA (▪) and variable amounts of pUC18 DNA (■) that were arranged as diagrammed in the figure. The templates in B were prepared by restriction nuclease digestion of the intron-containing fragment in Fig. 1 to produce molecules containing variable amounts of intron (▪) and vector (■) DNA.

DNA was uniformly labeled with [α-32P]dATP or uniquely end-labeled by using one32P-end-labeled primer in the polymerase chain reaction. DNA fragments were purified by electrophoresis through agarose gels and appropriate bands eluted from gels by the crush-soak method. Erythrocyte nuclei were prepared from chicken blood (Pel-Freeze) as described previously (36Fitzgerald D.J. Anderson J.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and digested with MNase (200 units/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C. Following centrifugation, nuclei were lysed by suspension in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm EDTA, centrifuged and the soluble chromatin made 0.6 m NaCl in order to dissociate histone Hl/H5. Mononucleosomes devoid of these histones were then recovered from Bio-Gel A-15M (Bio-Rad) columns run in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 0.6 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. Mononucleosomes were stored at 4 °C for periods of up to 1 month without detectable proteolysis of core histones as revealed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Nucleosome reconstitution was carried out by the histone exchange method (37Drew H. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 38Shrader T. Crothers D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the standard reaction, labeled DNA fragments (∼1 μg/ml) were incubated with nucleosomes (∼50 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing l m NaCl, 100 μg of albumin/ml, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Lower concentrations of nucleosomes (∼20 μg/ml) were used with the 322-bp template to ensure that only one octamer was bound to the fragment. The mixtures (10–200 μl) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the salt concentration was then lowered to 100, 50, or 25 mmwith 8–10 additions of 10 mm Tris buffer that were made about 20 min apart. Unless otherwise indicated, drugs were added 15 min before nucleosome addition. Reconstituted nucleosomes were electrophoresed on 6% PA gels containing 20% glycerol and 0.5 × TBE (8Pennings S. Meersseman G. Bradbury E.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6667-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Generally, electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature at 100 V for about 6 h. Greater than 95% of the radioactivity was incorporated into nucleosomes in the absence of drugs using these standard conditions. After nucleosome assembly, reaction mixtures in 50 mm NaCl were made 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml albumin and then digested with ExoIII or DNase I as detailed in the figure legends. Digestions were performed in parallel with digestions of free DNA which had been taken through the steps in the reconstitution reactions in the absence of nucleosomes. Reactions were then made 0.1% SDS, 0.35 mNaCl, 30 mm EDTA and the digested DNA purified by chloroform extraction. DNA fragments were then electrophoresed on 8% PA gels in 7.5 m urea and autoradiograms scanned with a densitometer. For the restriction enzyme studies, digestions were carried out for 1 h at room temperature in 10 mmMgCl2 containing either 50 or 100 mm NaCl and the fragments analyzed on 8% native PA gels. For the studies with MNase, digestions were carried out at room temperature in 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 for 10 min with 1 unit of MNase/ml. Protected DNA was then fractionated on 1.3% agarose gels. DNA fragments 135–155 bp in length were recovered from these gels, secondarily cleaved with restriction enzymes, and concentrated by ethanol precipitation prior to electrophoresis. The nitrocellulose filter binding assay was carried out as described previously (39Brown J.W. Anderson J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1349-1354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the NaCl concentrations for sample application and washing indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. For DAPI binding experiments, reconstitution was carried out by gradient dialysis (2m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, to 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 18 h using purified erythrocyte core histones and the 192-bp intron Eco RI fragment or wheat genomic DNA at a protein:DNA ratio of 0.9:1.0. Reconstituted nucleosomes and the corresponding naked DNAs were incubated with DAPI (10 μm) at 4, 25, and 37 °C for times that ranged from 1 min to 3 h. Binding at all temperatures as determined by fluorescence enhancement at 465 nm was essentially maximum within 3 min with both nucleosome and naked DNA and binding extents were similar with naked Vs corresponding nucleosome DNA.

As seen in the bottom of Fig.1, the 192-bp Eco RI fragment contains 17 AT sites which are arranged in a 10–11 bp periodicity. Each of these regions is a binding site for minor groove-specific drugs.2 DNA must bend around the histone octamer to be incorporated into a nucleosome. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that intrinsically bent DNA would facilitate nucleosome formation and several studies seem to support this view (42Trifonov E.N. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3816-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 43Hsieh C.-H. Griffith J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 535-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Pennings S.

To determine whether the circular intron segment is preferentially packaged into a nucleosome, nucleosomes were assembled onto four labeled fragments of similar lengths by exchange of histones from chicken erythrocyte mononucleosomes using the salt-dilution method. Reconstituted samples were then analyzed on the PA-glycerol gels shown in Fig. 1. To assess the relative reconstitution efficiencies, experiments were carried out in the presence of increasing amounts of histones in the absence of competitor DNA (45Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Salina G. Negri R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (lanes 1–5, panel E) and in the presence of maximal amounts of histones and two concentrations of competitor (38Shrader T. Crothers D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (lanes 6 and 7). The single type of complex formed on each template was judged to be a nucleosome since each comigrated with mononucleosomes from cellular chromatin and each yielded a protected fragment of 140–150 bp following digestion by micrococcal nuclease (data not shown). The circular intron fragment displayed the highest reconstitution efficiency as it required the least amount of histones to form a nucleosome. Reconstitution efficiencies of a synthetic bent segment, a bent DNA satellite, and the sea urchin 5 S rDNA were about 1.3-, 2-, and 5-fold lower than the circular element (Fig.1 E). The competitive reconstitutions (lanes 6 and 7) also demonstrated this trend with the highest competition effect seen with the 5 S rDNA sequence and the lowest with intron DNA. The efficiency of reconstitution of the intron fragment was nearly identical to that reported for the circular segment from the Crithidia fasciculata kinetoplast (45Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Salina G. Negri R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This efficiency is similar to the TG and GT reference sequences used by Shrader and Crothers (38Shrader T. Crothers D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 45Costanzo G. Di Mauro E. Salina G. Negri R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (which were found to display higher histone binding affinities than several natural nucleosome positioning sequences). The 192-bp intron segment must undergo substantial additional bending when packaged into a nucleosome where 145 bp of DNA are wound about 1.65 times around the histone octamer. Thus, an analysis of inhibiting this bending during reconstitution by minor groove binding drugs may provide a further understanding of the functional significance of sequence-directed curvature and anisotropic bendability in chromatin formation. The effects of the minor groove binding drug DAPI on the assembly of a nucleosome onto the intron segment is shown in Fig.2 A. The drug concentrations used in this experiment were within the range of those previously employed to study the structure of the intron DNA by electrophoretic and ligation techniques and to identify the drug-binding sites by footprinting analysis.2 The ligand inhibited the formation of a nucleosome on the circular segment and the effectiveness was similar to inhibitory potencies of DAPI in electrophoretic and ligation assays.2 The marked specificity of the drug for the circular element is clearly illustrated in the figure which shows that it has little or no effect on the assembly of nucleosomes onto noncurved segments (B and D), moderately curved segments that contain noncurved sequences (C and E), or total genomic DNA. It is possible that DAPI does not prevent the transfer of the histones to the intron fragment during reconstitution but rather produces an extended nucleosome that comigrates with protein-free DNA on PA-glycerol gels. However, this possibility is unlikely since the drug-treated reconstituted intron fragment also comigrated with drug-treated naked DNA on agarose and PA gels run in the absence of glycerol (data not shown). In addition, digestion of the reconstitute with MNase and ExoIII yielded patterns of DNA fragment lengths that were essentially indistinguishable from those produced by digestion of protein-free intron DNA that had been preincubated with the drug (data not shown). The analysis shown in Fig.3 A provides more direct evidence that histones are not associated with the intron segment when the reconstitution is carried in the presence of DAPI. In the experiment, DNA fragments and erythrocyte core particles were incubated in 1 m NaCl with and without the drug. Samples were then removed at the indicated NaCl concentrations during dilution and applied directly to nitrocellulose which binds protein-DNA complexes but not protein-free double-stranded DNA. In the absence of DAPI, maximal or near maximal DNA-protein binding was seen starting at 0.5m NaCl, presumably because histone transfer was complete when the ionic strength had been reduced to this level. DAPI preincubation selectively inhibited the binding of the circular intron segment to the membrane at all NaCl concentrations, which strongly suggests that the intron DNA remains histone-free during the entire course of reconstitution. In contrast, there was little or no effect of the drug on the binding of the histones to the control molecules. To study the stage in the assembly reaction that is most sensitive to DAPI, the drug was added to reconstitution mixtures at various steps during salt dilution. After the final dilution to 0.1 mNaCl, samples were resolved electrophoretically in order to determine the fraction of the intron and exon fragments that were packaged into nucleosomes (Fig. 3 B). There was no significant effect of drug addition on the assembly of the nucleosome onto the exon sequence. In contrast, DAPI selectively inhibited assembly onto the intron segment principally during early stages in the reconstitution at NaCl concentrations (≥0.6 m) that correspond to those at which the transfer of the histones onto the labeled DNA fragment occurs (37Drew H. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar,38Shrader T. Crothers D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). An important question concerning the action of the drug is whether the ligand can selectively disrupt a preformed nucleosome containing the intron sequence. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the nucleosome gel band broadens in response to drug treatment in contrast to the nucleosome containing the 5 S rDNA sequence. In addition, a small amount of free DNA was produced when the intron-containing nucleosome was exposed to DAPI (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, the drug may promote a selective modification of the intron nucleosome rather than causing actual histone displacement. The results of the nitrocell"

In a transient expression assay, a subnuclear localization signal consisting of 58 residues between amino acids 120 and 177 of COP1 was able to confer speckled localization onto the heterologous nuclear NIa protein from tobacco etch virus. The subnuclear localization signal overlaps two previously characterized motifs, a cytoplasmic localization signal and a putative α-helical coiled-coil domain that has been implicated in COP1 dimerization.

When grown under light conditions, Arabidopsis seedlings follow a developmental pathway known as photomorphogenesis, during which aerial portions of the seedling are prepared for photoautotrophic metabolism. When germinating in darkness, however, seedlings use their seed storage reserves to follow an alternative pathway, termed etiolation, in apparent adaptation for rapid growth toward a light source (1von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Loss of function mutants in the COP1 gene cause constitutive photomorphogenesis, implicating COP1 as a repressor of photomorphogenesis or an activator of etiolation. In cop1 mutants, photomorphogenesis in darkness is mediated at least in part by the transcriptional derepression of light-inducible nuclear genes, indicating that COP1 functions, directly or indirectly, as a transcriptional repressor (1von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Deng X.-W. Matsui M. Wei N. Wagner D. Chu A.M. Feldmann K.A. Quail P.H.

Plant J. 1998; 15: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The COP1 protein contains an amino-terminal zinc binding Ring finger domain (Ring), a coiled-coil domain (Helix), a central core domain, and a carboxyl-terminal domain composed of WD-40 repeats (2Deng X.-W.

Miséra S. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). COP1 protein is expressed under both light and dark conditions, and severe cop1 mutants show a seedling-lethal phenotype even under light conditions, suggesting that COP1, besides regulating photomorphogenesis, plays a second fundamental role during late embryogenesis, seedling, and vegetative development (5Miséra S. Müller A.J. Weiland-Heidecker U. Jürgens G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A COP1 fragment composed of the Ring finger and Helix domains, the allele COP1–4, can satisfy the need for the latter, light-independent, functions of COP1, but for repression of light-inducible gene expression, the full COP1 protein is required (4McNellis T.W. von Arnim A.G. Araki T. Komeda Y. Miséra S. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).The regulatory function of COP1 appears to be mediated by interactions with other nuclear proteins, including the COP1-interactive protein-7 (CIP7), a likely transcriptional activator (6Yamamoto Y.Y. Matsui M. Ang L.-H. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the basic leucine zipper protein HY5 (7Ang L-H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Given that hy5 mutants display reduced responsiveness to light and that HY5 can bind to light-regulatory promoter elements, COP1 may repress transcription by interfering with light-regulated transcriptional activation (8Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.-H. Puente P. Deng X.-W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Light signals may regulate the activity of COP1 at least in part by modulating the nuclear level of the COP1 protein. A fusion protein between COP1 and β-glucuronidase as a reporter accumulates in the nucleus of Arabidopsis seedling stem (hypocotyl) cells in darkness, yet it is excluded from the nucleus under light conditions (9von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 10von Arnim A.G. Osterlund M.T. Kwok S.F. Deng X.-W. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The redistribution of the β-glucuronidase-COP1 protein by light is mediated by multiple photoreceptors of the phytochrome and cryptochrome families (11Osterlund M.T. Deng X.-W. Plant J. 1998; 16: 201-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic localization of COP1 is mediated by a cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS),1 which counteracts a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), located in the central core domain, in a light-dependent manner (12Stacey M.G. Hicks S.N. von Arnim A.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The COP1 protein displays a characteristic localization to discrete subnuclear sites under a variety of experimental conditions. Immunofluorescence labeling has highlighted COP1 in discrete subnuclear regions in wild-type Arabidopsis cells. Moreover, both β-glucuronidase-COP1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-COP1 fusion proteins accumulate in subnuclear foci when expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis or in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells (13von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Stacey M.G. Gene. 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Ang L-H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Like the nucleus of animal cells (14Lamond, A. I., and Earnshaw, W. C. (1998) 280, 547–553Google Scholar, 15Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the plant cell nucleus is a highly structured organelle (16Shaw P.J. Essays Biochem. 1996; 31: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). For example, telomeres appear to be located preferentially at the nuclear periphery (17Rawlins D.J. Highett M.I. Shaw P.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1991; 100: 424-431Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ribosomal gene transcription and ribosome preassembly are sequestered into nucleoli, organelles that are further subdivided into domains (18Beven A.F. Lee R. Razaz M. Leader D.J. Brown J.W.S. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shaw, P. J., Beven, A. F., Wells, B., Highett, M. I., and Jordan, E. G. (1996) 181, 178–185Google Scholar). Certain splicing components are concentrated in subnuclear granules or speckles, some of which are immunologically related to coiled bodies (20Beven A.F. Simpson G.G. Brown J.W.S. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Boudonck K. Dolan L. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 18: 1687-3694Google Scholar, 22Glyn M.C.P. Leitch A.R.

In animal cell nuclei, numerous proteins are distributed in diverse “micro-punctate” patterns, which may be functionally relevant in the regulation of gene expression (e.g. Refs. 24Brett D. Whitehouse S. Antonson P. Shipley J. Cooper C. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the subnuclear compartmentalization of the plant nucleus and its role in gene expression are comparatively poorly understood.We reasoned that a mutational analysis of the structural requirements in COP1 for localization to nuclear foci may shed light on the biological role of the foci for COP1 function and on the cooperation between the cytoplasmic, nuclear, and subnuclear targeting signals within COP1. Using primarily fusion proteins between COP1 mutants and green fluorescent protein, we found that a short subfragment of the COP1 coiled-coil domain confers localization to foci on a heterologous protein, that a domain responsible for the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be separated from the subnuclear localization signal, and that three phenotypically lethal mutations in the WD-40 domain of COP1 interfere with the subnuclear targeting of GFP-COP1. Our data represent the first mutational analysis of the subnuclear targeting of a plant protein.DISCUSSIONA variety of nuclear factors can dynamically localize to discrete subnuclear domains or foci rather than being randomly dispersed throughout the nucleus (reviewed in Refs. 14Lamond, A. I., and Earnshaw, W. C. (1998) 280, 547–553Google Scholar and 15Strouboulis J. Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These factors include catalytic protein complexes involved in replication (33Hozak P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), transcription (e.g. ribosomal RNA transcription by polymerase I (16Shaw P.J. Essays Biochem. 1996; 31: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar)), and splicing (34Huang S. Spector D.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), as well as regulatory proteins that control these processes, for instance Drosophila Polycomb (35Messmer S. Franke A. Paro R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and MSL-2 (25Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In plants, pioneering studies have confirmed the general notion derived from studies in animals that the plant nucleus possesses a well defined architecture (17Rawlins D.J. Highett M.I. Shaw P.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1991; 100: 424-431Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Shaw, P. J., Beven, A. F., Wells, B., Highett, M. I., and Jordan, E. G. (1996) 181, 178–185Google Scholar, 20Beven A.F. Simpson G.G. Brown J.W.S. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, few regulatory proteins have been examined closely for their subnuclear distribution. The COP1 protein, a fundamental plant nuclear regulator encoded by a member of the pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS genes, exhibits a characteristic localization to discrete nuclear foci besides a faint diffuse distribution (7Ang L-H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 12Stacey M.G. Hicks S.N. von Arnim A.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Stacey M.G. Gene. 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In transient co-expression assays, native COP1 is able to redistribute the basic leucine zipper protein HY5 into nuclear foci, suggesting that the COP1 protein in the foci must be in an at least partly native configuration (7Ang L-H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Here, we have begun to delineate the structural motifs that mediate the distribution of COP1 between a soluble form and a form associated with nuclear foci.Two distinct structural elements in COP1 are important for localization to nuclear foci, namely the WD-40 domain and the Helix domain. The WD-40 domain may play an indirect role, because it did not mediate foci formation alone. However, a loss or a reduction in foci formation was observed for three GFP-COP1 fusions mutated in the WD-40 domain, COP1–8, COP1–9, and COP1–11. The COP1–9 allele has a G524Q missense mutation in a residue conserved among three plant COP1 homologs from Arabidopsis, pea (Zhao et al. (36Zhao L. Wang C. Zhu Y. Zhao J. Wu X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)), and tomato. COP1–8 is an exon-skipping mutant, and COP1–11 has a premature stop codon. All three are loss-of-function alleles (4McNellis T.W. von Arnim A.G. Araki T. Komeda Y. Miséra S. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Neither mutant disrupted the localization of wild-type GFP-COP1 in our transient assay, consistent with the recessive nature of the mutations.Other than the WD-40 domain, the Helix domain was both necessary and sufficient for foci formation, as indicated first by the complete disappearance of foci upon its deletion. Second, the Helix domain, together with the central core domain containing the NLS, formed the minimum COP1 fragment that showed foci. In addition, a 58-amino acid fragment within the Helix, residues 120–177, conferred localization to foci onto the heterologous nuclear-targeted NIa protein. The NIa protein from tobacco etch virus was chosen because it contains a strong and context-independent NLS (27Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. Leinicke A.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 953-962PubMed Google Scholar). The GFP-NIa fusion, unlike GFP-COP1, was dispersed throughout the nucleoplasm, with some preferential association with nucleoli (37Baunoch D. Das P. Hari V. J. Ultrastruct. and Mol. Struct. Res. 1988; 99: 203-212Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which may be mediated by an RNA binding activity of the NIa protein (38Daros J.-A. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1997; 237: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 58-residue fragment, which we refer to as a SNLS (Fig. 7), also prevented the characteristic nucleolar enrichment of NIa. Like the GFP-COP1 foci, the foci formed by the GFP-SNLS-NIa fusion were rounded, approximately 1 μm in diameter, and evenly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, indicating that both are equivalent structures. Moreover, co-expression of the SNLS-NIa fusion with COP1 clearly showed that all the COP1 foci contained the SNLS-NIa protein.Few proteins have been examined closely for the targeting signals that actively confer localization to subnuclear sites. In the Drosophila Polycomb protein, the chromodomain is able to confer a speckled localization onto β-galactosidase (35Messmer S. Franke A. Paro R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1241-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the human ALL-1 protein, two distinct motifs, both with similarity to Drosophila trithorax, were able to localize covalently linked cytoplasmic pyruvate kinase to nuclear foci (39Yano T. Nakamura T. Blechmann J. Sorrio C. Dang C.V. Geiger B. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7286-7291Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the mammalian protein SP100, targeting to nuclear bodies containing the promyelocytic leukelia protein PML requires a domain thought to include a helical motif (40Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The SNLS of COP1 does not show obvious sequence similarity with any of these proteins nor with any other known proteins apart from COP1 orthologs. However, physiologically, COP1 functions as a repressor of gene expression, and the localization to nuclear foci may be instrumental in regulating the access of COP1 to its target sites.The SNLS between residues 120 and 177 represents a portion of the COP1 CLS (residues 67–177; Ref. 12Stacey M.G. Hicks S.N. von Arnim A.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar; Fig. 7), as well as of a COP1 fragment mediating dimerization (residues 105–211 (41Torii K.U. McNellis T.W. Deng X.-W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5577-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). The Helix domain (coiled-coil: 125–220) also mediates interactions with proteins other than COP1, namely the predominantly cytoplasmic CIP1 protein (42Matsui M. Stoop C.D. von Arnim A.G. Wei N. Deng X.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4239-4243Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the nuclear CIP7 (6Yamamoto Y.Y. Matsui M. Ang L.-H. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), neither of which, however, is known to localize to nuclear foci. It is possible that the SNLS interacts with yet other nuclear proteins to target COP1 to the foci. In addition, COP1-COP1 multimerization may play a role, given that COP1(1–282) dimerizes strongly in the yeast two-hybrid assay (32McNellis T.W. Torii K.U. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1491-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Reich B. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12555-12566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the SNLS motif retained approximately 25% of two-hybrid activity (data not shown). It is intriguing that the SNLS is part of a larger motif that mediates the cytoplasmic localization of COP1, and the CLS is itself under regulation by other COP1 domains that inhibit CLS activity in darkness (12Stacey M.G. Hicks S.N. von Arnim A.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Maybe, in the context of wild-type COP1, a factor that inhibits localization to nuclear foci is required to activate the CLS and vice versa.Currently, our data do not allow us to distinguish whether the foci represent a site of active COP1 protein or a dispensable storage site for inactive COP1. However, the observed correlation between loss-of-function and loss of nuclear foci among three mutations in the WD-40 domain is certainly consistent with a functional role of the foci. Perturbations in the subnuclear localization of specific proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease (43Kastner P. Perez A. Lutz Y. Rochette-Egli C. Gaub M.-P. Durand B. Lanotte M. Berger R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 629-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). For example, the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene product is distributed between a diffuse phase and a punctate phase, the latter containing splicing factors involved in RNA maturation (44Larsson S.H.

Loss of DNA binding of WT1 was associated with accumulation in the punctate form (28Englert C. Vidal M. Maheshwaran S. Ge Y. Ezzell R.M. Isselbacher K.J. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our data on the subnuclear localization of COP1 suggest that subnuclear partitioning of regulatory proteins is not confined to animal cells but also occurs in plants . Recently, a GFP fusion of the phytochrome B photoreceptor was shown to localize to nuclear foci highly reminiscent of those seen for COP1 (29Yamaguchi R. Nakamura M. Mochizuki N. Kay S.A. Nagatani A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), an intriguing result given that COP1 nuclear localization is negatively regulated by phytochrome B (11Osterlund M.T. Deng X.-W. Plant J. 1998; 16: 201-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional examples of subnuclear localization patterns in plant cells are likely to be discovered. Their biochemical characterization with respect to the foci formed by COP1 and by foci seen in animal cells may shed light on the structural basis of gene regulation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the constitutive photomorphogenesis 1 (COP1) protein mediates diverse developmental adaptations in response to environmental light signals. When grown under light conditions, Arabidopsis seedlings follow a developmental pathway known as photomorphogenesis, during which aerial portions of the seedling are prepared for photoautotrophic metabolism. When germinating in darkness, however, seedlings use their seed storage reserves to follow an alternative pathway, termed etiolation, in apparent adaptation for rapid growth toward a light source (1von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Loss of function mutants in the COP1 gene cause constitutive photomorphogenesis, implicating COP1 as a repressor of photomorphogenesis or an activator of etiolation. In cop1 mutants, photomorphogenesis in darkness is mediated at least in part by the transcriptional derepression of light-inducible nuclear genes, indicating that COP1 functions, directly or indirectly, as a transcriptional repressor (1von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Deng X.-W. Matsui M. Wei N. Wagner D. Chu A.M. Feldmann K.A. Quail P.H.

The COP1 protein contains an amino-terminal zinc binding Ring finger domain (Ring), a coiled-coil domain (Helix), a central core domain, and a carboxyl-terminal domain composed of WD-40 repeats (2Deng X.-W. Matsui M. Wei N. Wagner D. Chu A.M. Feldmann K.A. Quail P.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 791-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 4McNellis T.W. von Arnim A.G. Araki T. Komeda Y. Miséra S. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). COP1 protein is expressed under both light and dark conditions, and severe cop1 mutants show a seedling-lethal phenotype even under light conditions, suggesting that COP1, besides regulating photomorphogenesis, plays a second fundamental role during late embryogenesis, seedling, and vegetative development (5Miséra S. Müller A.J. Weiland-Heidecker U. Jürgens G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A COP1 fragment composed of the Ring finger and Helix domains, the allele COP1–4, can satisfy the need for the latter, light-independent, functions of COP1, but for repression of light-inducible gene expression, the full COP1 protein is required (4McNellis T.W. von Arnim A.G. Araki T. Komeda Y. Miséra S. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 487-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The regulatory function of COP1 appears to be mediated by interactions with other nuclear proteins, including the COP1-interactive protein-7 (CIP7), a likely transcriptional activator (6Yamamoto Y.Y. Matsui M. Ang L.-H. Deng X.-W. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and the basic leucine zipper protein HY5 (7Ang L-H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Given that hy5 mutants display reduced responsiveness to light and that HY5 can bind to light-regulatory promoter elements, COP1 may repress transcription by interfering with light-regulated transcriptional activation (8Chattopadhyay S. Ang L.-H. Puente P. Deng X.-W. Wei N. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Light signals may regulate the activity of COP1 at least in part by modulating the nuclear level of the COP1 protein. A fusion protein between COP1 and β-glucuronidase as a reporter accumulates in the nucleus of Arabidopsis seedling stem (hypocotyl) cells in darkness, yet it is excluded from the nucleus under light conditions (9von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Cell. 1994; 79: 1035-1045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 10von Arnim A.G. Osterlund M.T. Kwok S.F. Deng X.-W. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The redistribution of the β-glucuronidase-COP1 protein by light is mediated by multiple photoreceptors of the phytochrome and cryptochrome families (11Osterlund M.T. Deng X.-W. Plant J. 1998; 16: 201-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic localization of COP1 is mediated by a cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS),1 which counteracts a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), located in the central core domain, in a light-dependent manner (12Stacey M.G. Hicks S.N. von Arnim A.G. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 349-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The COP1 protein displays a characteristic localization to discrete subnuclear sites under a variety of experimental conditions. Immunofluorescence labeling has highlighted COP1 in discrete subnuclear regions in wild-type Arabidopsis cells. Moreover, both β-glucuronidase-COP1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-COP1 fusion proteins accumulate in subnuclear foci when expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis or in transiently transformed onion epidermal cells (13von Arnim A.G. Deng X.-W. Stacey M.G. Gene. 1998; 221: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Ang L-H. Chattopadhyay S. Wei N. Oyama T. Okada K. Batschauer A. Deng X.-W. Mol.

Essays Biochem. 1996; 31: 77-89PubMed Google Scholar). For example, telomeres appear to be located preferentially at the nuclear periphery (17Rawlins D.J. Highett M.I. Shaw P.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1991; 100: 424-431Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ribosomal gene transcription and ribosome preassembly are sequestered into nucleoli, organelles that are further subdivided into domains (18Beven A.F. Lee R. Razaz M. Leader D.J. Brown J.W.S.

Certain splicing components are concentrated in subnuclear granules or speckles, some of which are immunologically related to coiled bodies (20Beven A.F. Simpson G.G. Brown J.W.S. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Boudonck K. Dolan L. Shaw P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 18: 1687-3694Google Scholar, 22Glyn M.C.P. Leitch A.R.

In animal cell nuclei, numerous proteins are distributed in diverse “micro-punctate” patterns, which may be functionally relevant in the regulation of gene expression (e.g. Refs. 24Brett D. Whitehouse S. Antonson P. Shipley J. Cooper C. Goodwin G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1559-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V.

However, the subnuclear compartmentalization of the plant nucleus and its role in gene expression are comparatively poorly understood. We reasoned that a mutational analysis of the structural requirements in COP1 for localization to nuclear foci may shed light on the biological role of the foci for COP1 function and on the cooperation between the cytoplasmic, nuclear, and subnuclear targeting signals within COP1. Using primarily fusion proteins between COP1 mutants and green fluorescent protein, we found that a short subfragment of the COP1 coiled-coi"

In Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures, a brief burst of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron induced a persistent potentiation of neuromuscular synapses that exhibit immature synaptic functions. Induction of potentiation required an elevation of postsynaptic Ca2+ and expression of potentiation appeared to involve an increased probability of transmitter secretion from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Thus, activity-dependent persistent synaptic enhancement may reflect properties characteristic of immature synaptic connections, and bursting activity in developing spinal neurons may promote functional maturation of the neuromuscular synapse."

The amino acid sequence of this 753-residue PKAII anchor protein also includes an N-terminal myristoylation motif and a potential “phosphorylation site domain” (PSD) (6Li Z. Rossi E.A. Hoheisel J.D.

PSD modules (∼25–30 residues) of vertebrate myristoylated alanine rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) proteins bind calcium-calmodulin, phospholipids, and actin; cooperate with N-terminal myristate to attach proteins to cell membranes; constitute specific target sites for protein kinase C (PKC)-catalyzed phosphorylation; and participate in dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton that is associated with such fundamental cellular processes as motility and differentiation (7Aderem A.

Thus, predicted properties of DAKAP200 suggest that this polypeptide is polyfunctional, differentially targeted to membranes, and involved in routing and integrating signals propagated by three important second messengers: cAMP, diacylglycerol, and calcium (6Li Z.

Numerous caveats preclude acceptance of these ideas solely on the basis of information obtained from the amino acid sequence of DAKAP200. For example, incorporation of myristate at the N terminus is not an accurate predictor of membrane association. The myristoylated catalytic subunit of PKA isoforms and B subunit of calcineurin are not recruited to membranes (13Taylor S.S. Buechler J.A. Yonemoto W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 971-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 14Kennedy M.T. Brockman H. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26517-26521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, alignment of the DAKAP200 PSD-like domain with established vertebrate PSDs yields only a minimal level of sequence identity, despite similarities in amino acid composition and net charge. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of possible roles for DAKAP200 in signal transmission and integration must be preceded by systematic characterization of targeting, protein binding, and regulatory properties of predicted functional domains in the anchor protein. A series of studies addressing these topics and the properties of ΔDAKAP200, a second product of the DAKAP200 gene, are presented in this paper. A Western blot was probed with 32P-labeled RIIβ (using a subunit concentration of 0.3 nm and 2 × 105 cpm 32P radioactivity/ml), and RIIβ-binding proteins were visualized by autoradiography as described by Bregman et al.

Results were quantified by laser densitometry or PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously (17Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Segments of cDNA encoding partial DAKAP200 proteins were synthesized via polymerase chain reaction as described previously (18Land M. Islas-Trejo A. Freedman J.H. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Primers appended the following restriction sites to the amplified cDNAs: 5′-Nde I/3′-Bam HI for pET14b (Novagen) plasmid and 5′-Eco RI/3′-Bam HI for pGEX6 plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Product DNA was digested with restriction enzymes indicated above and cloned into bacterial expression plasmids that were cleaved with the same pairs of enzymes. In pET14b the cDNA insert is preceded by vector DNA that encodes a 20-residue N-terminal peptide. The N-terminal fusion peptide includes six consecutive His residues, which constitute a Ni2+-binding site. Transcription of the fusion gene is driven by the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 RNA polymerase. In pGEX6, expression is driven by an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-regulated tac promoter, and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein is generated. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with recombinant expression plasmid was grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as previously reported (18Land M. Islas-Trejo A.

After cloning the cDNA into the expression plasmid pRSETB (InVitrogen), His-tagged ΔDAKAP200 was expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity by using the strategy described above for pET14b.

Subsequently, the chimeric cDNAs were excised by digestion with Not I and Eco RV and cloned in the copper-inducible Drosophila expression vector pMK33 HS, which was cleaved with Not I and Stu I.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, S2 cells were resuspended in culture medium, washed, and then plated on 20-mm glass coverslips that were coated with poly-l-lysine. After a 16-h incubation in standard medium supplemented with 0.7 mm CuSO4, coverslips were washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (PBS). Next, cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 20 °C. After fixation and three washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized by incubation in acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. Further manipulations were performed at 20 °C. After washing three additional times in PBS, fixed/permeabilized cells were incubated in PBS containing 3% (w/v) albumin for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated with either anti-DAKAP200 serum (1:1000 in PBS) or murine anti-FLAG IgG (30 μg/ml; Sigma). Following five washes with PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20, coverslips were incubated with 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, goat IgGs directed against rabbit or mouse immunoglobulins. Samples were incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies. Next, cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After air drying, 15 μl of 50% glycerol in PBS, containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine (antibleaching agent), was placed on the specimens, and the coverslips were mounted on slides. Fluorescence signals corresponding to antigen-antibody complexes were collected with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Image Analysis Facility, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) as described previously (23Li Y.

For each series of immunofluorescence experiments, replicate samples of fixed/permeabilized cells were treated as described above except that antibodies directed against DAKAP200 were preincubated with saturating amounts of purified recombinant antigen. No fluorescence signals were obtained from these samples. Drosophila S2 cells were grown to confluence in eight 150-cm2 flasks and harvested. Cells were disrupted as described previously (6Li Z.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was collected and applied to a 1.5 × 6-cm column of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, which was equilibrated with buffer A containing 75 mm NaCl. After washing with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl, DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 were eluted with 0.2 m NaCl in buffer A. Next, the eluate was diluted 4-fold with buffer A and applied to a 0.9 × 2-cm column of SP Sepharose Fast Flow. After washing with 20 volumes of buffer A plus 0.1m NaCl, DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 were eluted with 0.35m NaCl in buffer A. Partially purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS and stored in liquid N2. Samples of recombinant ΔDAKAP200 or a GST fusion protein (GST-PSD) that contains residues 103–153 from ΔDAKAP200 (see Fig. 1) were incubated with highly purified PKC (3–5 nm) (Calbiochem) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and sonicated lipids (20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine plus 8 μg/ml diacylglycerol). After 15 min at 30 °C, GST-PSD and ΔDAKAP200 were separated from components of the reaction mixture by affinity chromatography on GSH-Sepharose 4B and Ni2+-chelate resin, respectively, as described above. When desired, 32P-labeled proteins were generated by substituting 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (3,000 cpm/pmol) for 0.1 mmnonradioactive ATP. cDNA encoding the PSD (residues 103–153) of ΔDAKAP200 was cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This enables synthesis and purification of a GST fusion protein that contains a consensus PKA phosphorylation site between GST and the C-terminal PSD. Purified fusion protein was prepared as described above. 32P-labeled GST-PSD (5 × 105cpm/pmol) was produced by incubation with Mg-[γ-32P]ATP and the purified catalytic subunit of PKA, using conditions described by Bregman et al. (15Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKA does not phosphorylate Ser or Thr residues in the PSD. 2H. Feng and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observation. Actin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was dissolved in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2 to yield a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. Polymerization to F-actin was induced by adding 2% (v/v) solution B (2.5 m KCl, 0.1m MgCl2, 50 mm ATP) and incubating for 30 min at 22 °C. Test ligands (ΔDAKAP200, GST-PSD) were incubated with 5 μm F-actin in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1.2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 22 °C in a 100-μl total volume. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 157,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C) in a Beckman Ti 42.2 rotor. The supernatant solution (containing free ligand) was collected, and 200 μl of incubation buffer was added to the pellet. After centrifugation at 157,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant solution was discarded, and the pellet (containing bound ligand) was dissolved in gel loading buffer. F-actin-bound and free GST-PSD or ΔDAKAP200 were size-fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis and detected by either Western immunoblotting or autoradiography (when proteins were labeled with 32P; see above). Gel lanes received 10% of the total supernatant or pellet fractions. Ligands did not pellet in the absence of F-actin. Calmodulin Sepharose 6B beads (1 mg/ml calmodulin) were equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Triton X-100 (v/v) (buffer C), and either 2.5 mmCaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. Samples of GST-PSD or ΔDAKAP200 were incubated with 5 μl of calmodulin-Sepharose 6B beads for 3 h at 22 °C in 0.5 ml of buffer C in the presence or absence (5 mm EGTA) of 2.5 mmCaCl2. Subsequently, beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g and washed five times (1.5 ml each wash) with modified buffer C (Triton X-100 concentration was increased to 0.1% (v/v) and albumin was omitted), by resuspension and centrifugation at 1000 × g. Washed beads containing bound ligand were incubated in 0.1 ml of SDS gel loading buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Bound GST-PSD or ΔDAKAP200 was visualized by Western immunoblotting. Ten percent of each sample was assayed. Descriptions of DNA sequence analysis, production and affinity purification of antibodies, preparation of cytosolic and particulate fractions of Drosophila S2 cells and hamster AV12 cells, electrophoresis of proteins, immunoprecipitations, cell culture and transfections, protein determination, and Western immunoblot analysis are provided in an accompanying paper (6Li Z.

The amino acid sequence (753 residues) of DAKAP200 is presented in Fig.1. ΔDAKAP200 comprises only 372 amino acids. Residues 1–344 in ΔDAKAP200 and DAKAP200 (Fig. 1) are identical. However, an exon encoding amino acids 345–725 in DAKAP200 is excised from ΔDAKAP200 mRNA (6Li Z. Rossi E.A. Hoheisel J.D. Kalderon D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27191-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, ΔDAKAP200 lacks the underlined portion of DAKAP200 (Fig. 1). The deleted segment includes the PKAII binding site (see below). Sequences of 28 amino acids at the C termini of the two proteins are identical. DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 have apparent Mr values of 200,000 and 95,000, respectively, in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (6Li Z. Rossi E.A. Hoheisel J.D. Kalderon D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27191-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences at the N termini of DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 constitute optimal acceptor sites (24Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) for protein N-myristoyltransferase. N-Myristoyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the C14 saturated fatty acyl moiety from myristoyl-CoA to the amino group of N-terminal Gly within a specific sequence context that includes Ser and Lys at positions 5 and 6, respectively, relative to Gly. Methionylaminopeptidase eliminates the initiator Met residue during translation, thereby generating a free Gly amino group that forms an amide linkage with myristate. Since myristoylation occurs co-translationally and is a relatively rare, site-specific (N terminus only), and stable protein modification, it is amenable to study by metabolic labeling with [3H]myristic acid (24Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Drosophila S2 cells were incubated with [3H]myristate for 16 h and then fractionated into cytosol and total particulate proteins. Denaturing electrophoresis and fluorography revealed that only 7–10 polypeptides in these cell fractions incorporated [3H]myristate (Fig.2 A, lanes 1 and 3). Moreover, three 3H-labeled cytosolic and three 3H-labeled pellet proteins exhibited apparent Mr values of either 95,000 or 200,000 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 3). These proteins were precipitated with anti-DAKAP200 IgGs (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and 4). Thus, both DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 are myristoylated in intact cells. The site of modification in DAKAP200 was probed by comparing [3H]myristate labeling of DAKAP200 and a mutant DAKAP200 that lacks residues 1–7 (Δ1–7) in stably transfected (hamster) AV12 cells. Control AV12 cells do not (a) contain proteins that react with anti-DAKAP200 IgGs or (b) synthesize myristoylated proteins with a Mr of 200,000. DAKAP200 and Δ1–7 DAKAP200 proteins were detected in supernatant and pellet fractions of homogenates of AV12 cells that carry the corresponding transgenes (Fig. 2, B and C). [3H]myristate was not incorporated into a 200-kDa protein in cells expressing Δ1–7 DAKAP200 (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Attempts to concentrate (and thereby identify) a minor 3H-labeled 200-kDa protein by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against DAKAP200 failed (Fig. 2, lane 6). In contrast, several3H-labeled proteins with apparent Mrvalues of ∼200,000 were evident in cells expressing DAKAP200 (Fig.2 A, lane 7). Moreover, the cluster of large myristoylated polypeptides was specifically precipitated with anti-DAKAP200 IgGs (Fig. 2 A, lane 8). Thus, residues at the N terminus are essential for myristoylation of the anchor protein. The isolation of four protein species in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2 A, lane 8) suggests that DAKAP200 undergoes multiple types of post-translational modification. The DAKAP200 polypeptide sequence (Fig. 1) includes two Cys residues whose side chains can serve as acceptors for a second type of acylation, palmitoylation (25Mumby S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although neither Cys residue is embedded within a classical palmitoylation context, the enzymology of palmitoyl transfer is not understood, and utilization of novel sites must be excluded experimentally. S2 cells that were labeled with [3H]palmitate contained six proteins that incorporated the C16 acyl moiety (data not shown). None of these proteins had an apparent Mr of 200,000 or 95,000, and none were precipitated by anti-DAKAP200 IgGs. Thus, palmitoylation does not appear to play a role in targeting/anchoring DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the intracellular disposition of endogenous, myristoylated DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 in Drosophila S2 cells (Fig.3 C). A modest level of antigen is dispersed in the cytoplasm. However, a high proportion of DAKAP200 and/or ΔDAKAP200 is associated with plasma membrane in these round embryo-derived cells. The role of N-terminal myristoylation in routing and anchoring DAKAP200 in situ was investigated by expressing wild type and mutant DAKAP200 proteins that were tagged at the C terminus with a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). Like the endogenous anchor protein, wild type DAKAP200-FLAG is targeted to the surface of S2 cells (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, anchor protein lacking myristate (Δ1–7 DAKAP200-FLAG) is distributed uniformly throughout S2 cell cytoplasm (Fig. 3 B). Thus, co-translational myristoylation of DAKAP200 apparently promotes differential accumulation of the anchor protein at the cell periphery. DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 are predicted to bear high levels of negative charge (−116 and −36, respectively) at neutral pH (6Li Z. Rossi E.A. Hoheisel J.D. Kalderon D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27191-27200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, both proteins include a compact region (residues 119–148, Fig. 1) that is positively charged (+12) and contains clusters of three types of amino acids: 13 Lys (plus one Arg), five Ser, and five residues with large hydrophobic side chains. These properties match characteristic features of PSDs in vertebrate MARCKS and MARCKS-related proteins (7Aderem A.

Despite similarities in charge, size, and composition, the analogy between the basic region of DAKAP200/ΔDAKAP200 and vertebrate PSDs is incomplete. Alignment of the basic region with conserved mouse and chicken PSD sequences reveals only a modest level (30%) of scattered identical residues (Fig. 4 A). To determine the significance of the basic region, we assayed DAKAP200/ΔDAKAP200 proteins for a critical PSD-linked function, the ability to bind F-actin. Full-length ΔDAKAP200 was expressed as a His-tagged fusion protein in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography. Although protein yields were low (<50 μg per 500-ml culture of E. coli), this approach yielded sufficient material to perform F-actin binding assays in the absence of competing actin-binding proteins, actin-severing proteins, proteases etc., thereby enabling straightforward analysis of data.

https://openalex.org/W1977087391,"The ability of the methyl-directed mismatch repair system to recognize and repair the exocyclic adducts propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG) and pyrimido[1,2-α]purin-10(3H)-one (M1G), the major adduct derived from the endogenous mutagen malondialdehyde, has been assessed both in vivo and in vitro. Both adducts were site-specifically incorporated into M13MB102 DNA, and the adducted genomes were electroporated into wild-type or mutS-deficient Escherichia coli strains. A decrease in mutations caused by both adducts was observed in mutS-deficient strains, suggesting that MutS was binding to the adducts and blocking repair by nucleotide excision repair. This hypothesis was supported by the differences in mutation frequency observed when hemimethylated genomes containing PdG on the (−)-strand were electroporated into a uvrA − strain. The ability of purified MutS to bind to PdG- or M1G-containing 31-mer duplexes in vitro was assessed using both surface plasmon resonance and gel shift assays. MutS bound to M1G:T-containing duplexes with similar affinity to a G:T mismatch but less strongly to M1G:C- and PdG-containing duplexes. Dissociation from each of the adduct-containing duplexes occurred at a faster rate than from a G:T mismatch. The present results indicate that MutS can bind to exocyclic adducts resulting from endogenous DNA damage and trigger their removal by mismatch repair or protect them from removal by nucleotide excision repair.

MDA reacts with DNA, forming a pyrimidopurinone adduct to deoxyguanosine (M1G) and an oxopropenyl adduct to deoxyadenosine (N 6-[3-(1-oxopropenyl)]deoxyadenosine) (M1A) (Fig. 1) (9Seto H. Akiyama K.

It has been detected in several human tissues at levels from 2–150 per 108 bases (14Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Reddy G.R. Yeola S.N. Morrow J.D. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J.

M1G may account for a significant portion of the genotoxic and cell cycle regulatory activity of MDA. Site-specific mutagenesis experiments indicate that M1G induces mutations to T and A on replication in Escherichia coli and is a block to replication (18Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Given the high biological activity of M1G, it is important to identify the pathways by which it may be removed from DNA. We have shown that M1G and a structural analog, propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG), are removed in E. coli by nucleotide excision repair and that PdG is excised by both E. coli and mammalian nucleotide excision repair complexes in vitro (18Fink S.P.

The experiments described in the present report were designed to test the hypothesis that M1G is recognized by the mismatch repair system. Mismatch repair exists to correct errors that arise during DNA replication, but recent studies indicate that it recognizes and acts on damaged DNA, including duplexes containing alkylated or platinated bases (20Modrich P.

In both cases, the mismatch repair system attempts to remove the normal base opposite the adduct, which sets up a futile cycle of repair and replication that leads to cell toxicity. M1G and other exocyclic adducts are relatively small adducts that resemble normal DNA bases, so they may be substrates for removal by mismatch repair. Transfection of M13 genomes containing single M1G or PdG adducts into E. coli strains deficient in mismatch repair suggested that both adducts are recognized and repaired by MutS-dependent mismatch repair. This conclusion was supported by in vitro studies of purified MutS protein binding to M1G- and PdG-containing duplexes. Ksp I was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Bss HII and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Formamide was from Aldrich Chemical. GELase was purchased from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified MutS protein were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The MutS protein ran as a single band at 95 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tris-HCl, EDTA, MOPS, calf thymus DNA, lauryl sulfate, ATP, ADP, and nonhydrolyzable analogs were purchased from Sigma. X-gal and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside were from Gold Biotechnology (St. Louis, MO). Nitrocellulose transfer membranes (BA85, 82.5-mm diameter) were purchased from Schleicher & Schuell. Ultrafree probind filters (0.45 μm) were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) was from NEN Life Science Products.

The M1G-adducted oligonucleotides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as described. Following purification, the M1G oligonucleotides were determined to be 99.7% pure by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the surface plasmon resonance assays, duplexes were 5′-biotinylated by phosphoramidite chemistry on the nonadducted strand. Oligonucleotides used as hybridization probes were prepared using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) automated DNA synthesizer in the Vanderbilt University Center in Molecular Toxicology Molecular Genetics Core and purified using a SurePureTMoligonucleotide purification kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The E. coli strains used in this study were JM105 (supE, tri, rpsL, endA, sbcB15, hsdR4, Δ(lac-proAB) [F′ traD36, proAB, lacI QZΔM15]) and several derivatives of AB1157 (thr-1, ara-14, leuB6, Δ(gpt-proA)62, lacY1, tsx-33, supE44, galK2, λ − , rac − , hisG4, rfbD1, mgl-51, rpsL31, kdgK51, xyl-5, mtl-1, argE3, thi-1). These included LM102 (AB1157; [F′, traD36, proAB, lacI QZΔM15]), LM107 (RK1517; [F′, traD36, proAB, lacI QZΔM15]), and LM119 (RPC501; [F′, traD36, proAB lacI QZΔM15]). LM102, LM107, and LM119 were constructed as described previously (18Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). RK1517 (AB1157; but mutS201::Tn5) and RPC501 (AB1157;nfo-1::kan, D(xth-pncA)90) were generous gifts from P. Modrich (Duke University, Durham, NC) and R. Cunningham (SUNY, Albany, NY), respectively. Single-stranded M13MB102 for the construction of M1G:C, M1G:T, or G:C genomes was isolated as described (27Benamira M. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Replicative form M13MB102 DNA was harvested using Qiagen columns (Chatsworth, CA).E. coli strain JM105 was used as the host bacterium for the production of M13MB102 methylated DNA and for the indicator plates.E. coli strain JM110 (dam −) was used as the host bacterium for the production of unmethylated M13MB102 in hemimethylated genome studies. Construction of gapped duplex M13MB102 DNA and ligation of adducted or unadducted 8-mers were as described previously (28Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded M13MB102 DNA was linearized with Ksp I and Bss HII and then dialyzed with a 12-fold excess of single-stranded M13MB102 DNA in decreasing concentrations of formamide. In some experiments, the single strand contained uracil in place of thymine residues to minimize replication of the nonadducted strand. The resultant gapped duplex DNA was isolated by a 0.8% low melting point agarose gel run in 40 mm Tris acetate/1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8). The gapped duplex band was excised, and the DNA recovered using the enzyme GELaseTM, according to the procedure provided by Epicentre Technologies. From this point on, the use of Tris buffers was avoided because of observations that Tris can conjugate to M1G in basic and frozen conditions (29Neidernhofer L.J. Riley M. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Sanduwaran G. Chaudhary A.K. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). M1G-, PdG-, and G-containing 8-mers (100 pmol) were phosphorylated prior to ligation using ATP (50 μm) and T4 polynucleotide kinase in 50 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.2). For the ligations, gapped duplex DNA was added to each of the phosphorylated G-, PdG-, and M1G-containing 8-mers along with 400 units of T4 DNA ligase and ATP (1 mm). The ligation reaction proceeded for 4 h at 16 °C in 50 mm MOPS buffer. The reaction mixtures were then brought up to a volume of 100 μl with water, and the DNA was purified by spinning through modified polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The ligation products were resolved on a 40 mmMOPS, 0.8% low melting point agarose gel. Doubly ligated DNA was excised from the gel and recovered using GELaseTM except the supplied 50× Bis-Tris-NaCl buffer was not used. No additional buffer was added. The amount of enzyme used for digestion was increased from 1 unit of enzyme/600 mg of gel slice to 1 unit/300 mg. Formation of G:T- and M1G:T M13MB102 DNA was the same as above except during the formamide dialysis, a 12-fold excess of single-stranded M13MB102 was used that contained a T at position 6256. Hemimethylated DNA was prepared similarly except the single-stranded DNA did not contain uracil. Gapped duplex DNA with methyl groups on the (−)-strand was prepared by formamide dialysis of methylated linear M13MB102 and unmethylated single-stranded M13MB102 DNA. Gapped duplex DNA with methyl groups on the (+)-strand was prepared by formamide dialysis of unmethylated linear M13MB102 and methylated single-stranded M13MB102 DNA. Cells were SOS-induced and transformed by electroporation as described previously (18Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria in logarithmic phase growth were SOS-induced with UV light before making them competent for transformation. The UV dose was determined by irradiating cells at increasing times from 0 to 3 min and then plating dilutions of the irradiated cells on LB plates. The optimal UV dose corresponded to roughly a 10% survival of the cells as compared with no exposure. For transformation, 3 μl of DNA sample (∼25 ng/μl) was added to 20 μl of cells. The cell/DNA mixture was placed into a chilled microelectroporation cuvette (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the electroporations were performed at 1.5 kV/cm using a Life Technologies, Inc. Cell-Porator E. coli electroporation system. After electroporation, 1 ml of SOC medium was added, and the bacteria were plated on LB plates in the presence of competent bacteria and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and allowed to grow overnight. To determine mutation frequencies, phage were eluted from the primary transformation plates, diluted, and then replated with JM105 on X-gal/isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside indicator plates to give roughly 300 plaques/plate. The plaques on the secondary plates were then lifted using nitrocellulose membranes and probed for base pair substitution mutations at position 6256 by differential hybridization with 13-mer probes. Membranes from 12 modified phage plates and 12 unmodified phage plates were split evenly into four dishes. Each dish contained one of the four probes. Because there was only one lift/plate and not four identical lifts with one membrane being placed into each dish, the summation of mutations detected along with G hybridizations sometimes did not add up to 100%. The specificity of the probes for a 1-base change at position 6256 has been shown previously (28Burcham P.C. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Benamira M. Singh U.S. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22392-22400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (−)-Strand oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 5 μl of kinase dilution buffer. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then heated to 70 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. The labeled oligonucleotide was purified by elution from a G50 microspin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column and annealed to a 5-fold excess of its unlabeled complementary strand. All binding reactions were carried out in 20-μl incubations on ice. 10 μl of 0–400 nm purified MutS protein was added to 5 μl (0.8 pmol/μl) of labeled oligonucleotide and 5 μl of reaction buffer (0.01 m MOPS-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 8.4 mm MgCl2, 3.4 mm EDTA, 10 ng/μl poly(dI·dC), 15% glycerol). Reactions were incubated on ice for 15 min, before loading onto a 4% polyacrylamide, 4% glycerol gel with a 40 mm MOPS, 1 mm MgCl2buffer run at constant voltage of 200 V for 2.5 h. Gels were then dried and analyzed using a 400E PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a streptavidin chip (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and duplex DNA containing a 5′-biotin on the nonadducted strand. Homo- or heteroduplex 31-mers were prepared by heating to 80 °C and cooling to room temperature over a 3-h period, in the presence of a 5-fold excess of the nonbiotinylated strand. All surface plasmon resonance assays were performed using a Biacore 2000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 25 °C in a running buffer of 0.01m MOPS-KOH (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 8.4 mm MgCl2, 0.008% Surfactant P20. Each streptavidin chip was washed with 20 μl of 50 nm NaOH and each flow cell derivatized with a duplex oligonucleotide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min, until a total binding of approximately 60 resonance units (RU) was achieved in each flow cell. MutS binding to the homo- or heteroduplex modified chips was assayed at various concentrations at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and the DNA derivatized chips were regenerated by washing with 20 μl of 0.5% SDS. When included, ATP, ADP, or nonhydrolyzable analogs were added to the reaction mixture in 2-fold excess of MutS concentration. Binding to each adduct was assayed at five different concentrations, and sensograms were prepared for kinetic analysis by subtraction of nonspecific binding to a G:C match. BIAEVAL 3.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) global analysis software was employed to simultaneously fit the association and dissociation data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model as described previously (31Babic I. Andrew S.E. Jirik F.R. Mutat. Res. 1996; 372: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Duplex M13MB102 genomes containing G, PdG, or M1G at position 6256 were constructed by ligation of 8-mer oligonucleotides into gapped duplexes as described previously. The resulting vectors were electroporated into SOS-induced E. coli strains that were wild type or deficient in mismatch repair, and progeny phage were probed for mutations. Single base pair substitutions were detected by differential hybridization of plaque DNA with radiolabeled 13-mer probes specific for each type of base pair substitution at position 6526. It was anticipated that the involvement of mismatch repair in the removal of M1G or PdG would result in an increased mutation frequency in cells that were deficient in mismatch repair. Such an effect is seen following transformation of PdG- or M1G-containing genomes into strains deficient in nucleotide excision repair (18Fink S.P. Reddy G.R. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8652-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, transformation of either PdG- or M1G-containing genomes into a MutS-deficient strain led to a decrease in mutation frequency (TableI). Approximately a 3-fold decrease in total mutations was observed with genomes containing PdG. The percentage of mutations induced by M1G decreased to below the limit of detection of the assay.Table IEffect of mismatch repair deficiency on the induction of mutations by PdG or M1GStrainM1G → GM1G → AM1G → TM1G → CMutationsLM102 (wt)1-aResults are expressed as percentages ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Mutation frequencies of site-specific PdG and M1G adducts transformed in repair deficient cells. The (+)-strand contained uracil residues to reduce replication of the non-adducted strand. We hypothesized that the decrease in mutations observed in mutS − cells is due to competitive binding of MutS and the uvrA2B complex to the adducts but repair only by the nucleotide excision complex (Fig.2). MutS cannot initiate repair because both the (+)- and (−)-strands of M13MB102 are methylated. Thus, in a wild-type cell, MutS protects the adduct from repair by uvr(A)BC. In the (uvrA −) strain, only MutS is present, so repair is not initiated, and the mutation frequency is increased 3–4-fold because of the prolonged half-life of the adduct. However, in the mutS − strain, uvr(A)BC is able to repair the adduct, and a decreased mutation frequency is observed. These observations and the hypothesis to explain them raise the question of whether the mismatch repair system is capable of removing PdG or M1G. To answer this question, we constructed hemimethylated plasmids containing PdG on the (−)-strand and methyl groups on either the (+)- or (−)-strand. Methylated single-stranded or double-stranded M13MB102 was isolated from JM105 (dam+), and unmethylated single- or double-stranded DNA was isolated from JM110 (dam −). Hemimethylated DNA was prepared by formamide dialysis, and gapped duplex DNA was prepared with methyl groups placed selectively on the (+)- or (−)-strand. Hemimethylated, adducted plasmids were transformed into E. coli, and the percentage of base pair substitutions at position 6526 was determined. The frequency of PdG → A transitions and PdG → T transversions were equivalent in all strains tested, so the total percentage of mutations is reported for simplicity. The percentage of base pair substitutions observed in JM105 (wt) was 1.5% when PdG was on the methylated strand and 1.0% and 1.1% when the strand opposite PdG was methylated or both strands were methylated (Table II). A similar percentage of mutations was observed in LM102. The lower mutation frequencies recorded in these experiments relative to those summarized in Table I resulted from the absence of uracil residues in the (+)-strand in the experiments summarized in Table II. The presence of uracil residues in the (+)-strand lowers the replication of the (+)-strand and increases the detection of mutations induced by adducts on the (−)-strand.Table IIEffect of methylation status on mutation frequencyBase pair substitution mutation frequencies (%) induced by PdG on hemimethylated DNA transformed into repair-deficient strains. The (+)-strand in these constructions did not contain uracil. ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Base pair substitution mutation frequencies (%) induced by PdG on hemimethylated DNA transformed into repair-deficient strains. The (+)-strand in these constructions did not contain uracil. ND, not determined. To probe for PdG removal by mismatch repair, differentially methylated genomes was transformed into uvrA-deficient cells. This was necessary to eliminate competitive nucleotide excision repair. As expected from previous results, the percentage of mutations observed in the uvrA − background was 3–4-fold higher when methyl groups were present on the PdG-containing strand or on both strands. In contrast, the percentage of mutations was much lower when methyl groups were present on the strand opposite PdG. This is consistent with removal of PdG by the methyl-directed mismatch repair system. When differentially methylated, PdG-containing genomes were transformed into mutS − cells, a decrease in mutations comparable with that reported in Table I was observed regardless of the methylation status of the genome. This suggests that removal of PdG by nucleotide excision repair is not sensitive to the presence of methyl groups on either the adducted or nonadducted strand. The results of the in vivo experiments suggested that MutS binds to PdG and M1G, triggering their removal by mismatch repair if the adduct-containing strand is not methylated. Therefore, we sought to confirm the ability of MutS to bind M1G or PdG in duplex DNA using an in vitro assay for protein-DNA interaction. Duplex 31-mers containing PdG or M1G at position 15 and C or T opposite the adduct were synthesized and bound to a streptavidin Biacore chip by the addition of a biotin residue to the 5′ terminus of the unadducted oligonucleotide. A duplex oligonucleotide of identical sequence but containing a G:T mismatch at position 15 was used as a control. Two separate flow cells were derivatized individually with approximately 60 RU of either 5′-biotinylated G:T duplex or G:C duplex. The binding of solutions containing various concentrations of MutS were assessed as the MutS-containing solutions were passed across the derivatized chips (Fig. 3). After the binding of a 400 nm MutS solution had reached equilibrium, the binding to the G:T duplex produced an absolute change of 616 RU (100%) compared with a change of 61 RU (9.9%) in the G:C duplex. The latter indicated a weak nonspecific interaction between MutS and the G:C duplex. This nonspecific binding was subtracted out of all binding sensograms produced from G:T- or adduct-containing duplexes. Binding to the G:T mismatch was assessed at various concentrations of MutS to produce binding isotherms that were subsequently analyzed for kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. At MutS concentrations of 50–400 nm, isotherms were globally fitted to a simple 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The BIAEVAL 3.0 program simultaneously determines kinetic association and dissociation constants from the rate of change of response with respect to time (slope of association and dissociation curves). The G:T mismatch had an apparent thermodynamic dissociation constant (KD) of 18 nm. Kinetic measurements indicated a kd of 2.44 × 10−3 s−1 and ka of 1.36 × 105m−1 s−1with a chi square value of 1.10, falling well within accepted statistical values for Biaeval 3.0 analysis. These thermodynamic constants compare favorably with a KD of 20 ± 5 nm determined by DNA footprinting and gel shift analysis (32Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The relative binding of MutS to PdG and M1G adducts was assessed in a manner similar to the G:T mismatch. Each adduct was probed at several different concentrations of MutS, nonspecific binding was subtracted out, and the sensograms were subjected to global kinetic analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 4, when all adduct-containing duplexes are probed with the same concentration of 200 nm MutS, the equilibrium level of binding of MutS to the M1G:T duplex is very close to that of a G:T mismatch (240 RU versus 219 RU). Binding to an M1G:C duplex gave a lower absolute response of 138 RU, and binding to both PdG:C and PdG:T duplexes was even less significant. PdG:C showed an equilibrium response of 85 RU, and PdG:T showed only 41 RU. Although the thermodynamic interactions between MutS and M1G:T or G:T duplexes are similar, Fig. 4 illustrates that there are differences in the rates of association and dissociation. Whereas MutS binds to PdG and M1G duplexes with a ka comparable with that of a G:T duplex, dissociation from PdG or M1G duplexes occurs significantly faster than dissociation from the G:T duplex. This observation is confirmed by the kinetic and thermodynamic constants that were extrapolated from sensogram data (TableIII). The dissociation of MutS from M1G and PdG duplexes occurs approximately 5-fold faster than dissociation from the G:T duplex. Because the association rates are comparable, the lower KD for the MutS-G:T duplex reflects the lower rate of dissociation.Table IIIKinetic and thermodynamic parameters of MutS binding to M1G- and PdG-containing duplexeskakdKDχ2105m−1s−110−3 s−110−8mG:T1.36 ± 0.072.44 ± 0.041.791.10M1G:T3.39 ± 0.037.82 ± 0.072.311.34M1G:C3"

In certain disease states, including pulmonary fibrosis and atherosclerosis, loss of this regulation gives rise to either excess or inappropriate fibronectin deposition (1Hynes R.O. Fibronectins.

J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 569-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased fibronectin deposition (22Wu C. McDonald J.A. Keivens V.M. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1995; 83: 715-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) upon disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D. More recent studies have defined a role for Rho-mediated contractility in the expression of matrix assembly sites and fibronectin deposition (18Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M.

Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 539-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) results in an increase in amino-terminal fibronectin fragment binding and enhanced fibronectin deposition. Taken together, these observations indicate that matrix assembly site expression and fibronectin deposition are regulated, in part, by actin stress fiber formation and the contractile state of the cell. Although it has been well documented that decreased fibronectin matrix assembly occurs in most transformed and tumor-derived cell lines, little is known about the extracellular signals that regulate matrix assembly activity in normal fibroblasts. Earlier studies have demonstrated that cells adherent to vitronectin exhibit decreased levels of cell surface matrix assembly sites compared with fibronectin-adherent cells (21Christopher R.A. Kowalczyk A.P. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 569-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dzamba B.J. Bultmann H. Akiyama S.K. Peters D.M. J. Biol.

These data suggest the possibility that the interaction of cells with vitronectin generates inhibitory signals that regulate matrix assembly site expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that the interaction of cells with vitronectin inhibits matrix assembly site expression and fibronectin deposition. The region of vitronectin responsible for the inhibition of fibronectin matrix assembly was localized to the heparin-binding domain. The inhibitory effect of vitronectin's heparin-binding domain was independent of the integrin receptor used to assemble the fibronectin matrix. Vitronectin-mediated inhibition of matrix assembly site expression could be overcome by treatment of cells with LPA, an agent that promotes actin polymerization (18Zhang Q. Checovich W.J. Peters D.M. Albrecht R.M. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1447-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Zhang Q. Magnusson S. Mosher D.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 8: 1415-1425Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interaction of fibronectin-adherent cells with the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin resulted in changes in actin microfilament organization and the subcellular distribution of the actin-associated proteins, α-actinin, and talin. These data suggest a mechanism whereby the heparin-binding domain of vitronectin down-regulates fibronectin matrix assembly through alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Gel electrophoresis supplies were from Bio-Rad. Unless other indicated, chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody was prepared by as described previously (28Kowalczyk A.P. Tulloh R.H. McKeown-Longo P.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 2335-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Etzler C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa amino-terminal fragment of fibronectin was generated by limited digestion of intact fibronectin with cathepsin D, followed by gelatin affinity chromatography as described previously (30McKeown-Longo P.J.

Vitronectin was purified from fibronectin- and fibrinogen-depleted human plasma by heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) affinity chromatography according to the method of Yatohgo et al. (31Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa cell-binding fragment of vitronectin was generated by acid cleavage of intact vitronectin (32Suzuki S. Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Nguyen K. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15307-15314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified vitronectin was dissolved in 70% formic acid and incubated at 37 °C for 46 h. The digested vitronectin was diluted 1:10 with water, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6. The 40-kDa cell-binding fragment of vitronectin was separated from heparin-binding fragments by exclusion on a heparin-Sepharose affinity column. Vitronectin fragments that bound to the heparin-Sepharose were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in 25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Both the cell-binding and heparin-binding fragments were dialyzed extensively against PBS prior to use. Purity of protein preparations was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were frozen at −80 °C until use. Rat tail collagen type I was purchased from Beckton Dickinson. Laminin (purified from EHS tumors) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Thrombospondin was purified from platelet releasate as described previously (72Murphy-Ullrich J.

Recombinant human fibronectin III9,10 (FnIII9,10) was expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) as described previously (9Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 431-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify human fibronectin cDNA encoding the 12th and 13th type III modules of fibronectin (FnIII12,13) (bases 5081–5623). This DNA encodes amino acids Ala-1689 through Thr-1869, which represents the major heparin-binding region of fibronectin (34Barkalow F.J.B. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bases are numbered from the A in the codon for the first amino acid of the mature protein (EMBL accession number X02761), and amino acids are numbered from the amino-terminal pyroglutamic acid (35Petersen T.E.

The sense primers for the FnIII12,13 construct (5′-CC GGATCC GCTATTCCTGCACCAACTGAC) and the VnHBDconstruct (5′-CCC GGATCC GCACCCCGCCCCTCCTTG) were synthesized with a Bam HI site (shown in boldface type) at the 5′-end. The antisense primers for the FnIII12,13construct (5′-CCC GAATTC CTATAGTGGAGGC GTCGATGACCA) and the VnHBD construct (5′-CCC GAATTC CTAGGCGCGGGATGGCCGGCG) were synthesized with an Eco Ri site (shown in boldface type) at the 5′-end. Underlined bases introduce a stop codon after the last base in the sequence to be amplified. PCR was performed according to established procedures (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.87Google Scholar), using human full-length fibronectin cDNA, pFH100 (a gift from Dr. Jean Thiery, Paris, France) or vitronectin cDNA (a gift from Dr. Erkki Ruoslahti, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) as a template. Following restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR-amplified DNA was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and transfected into BL21 (DE3) bacteria using standard procedures (40Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.74-1.87Google Scholar). PCR-amplified DNA was sequenced to confirm that no base changes had been introduced during amplification of the DNA. Fusion proteins were isolated by passing bacterial lysates over glutathione-agarose as described previously (8Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were dialyzed extensively against PBS prior to use. Both GST-FnIII12,13 and GST-VnHBD bound avidly to heparin-Sepharose (data not shown). Recombinant vitronectins were produced using a baculovirus expression system. Nonmutant and mutant vitronectins were PCR-amplified using the sense primer 5′-GGCTACCGTTCACAACGA and the antisense primer 5′-GGGTCTAGACTACAGATGGCCAGGAGCTGG. The VnRGEmutant was produced using recombinant PCR (41Higuchi R. PCR Technology. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 61-70Google Scholar). The two mutagenic primers were 5′-GCAAGCCCCAAGTGACTCGCGGGGA G GTGTTCACTATGCCGGAGGATGAGT (sense) and 5′-ACTCATCCTCCGGCATAGTGAACAC C TCCCCGCGAGTCACTTGGGGCTTGC (antisense). The mutated bases are shown in boldface type. The two outer primers used were the same as those used to amplify nonmutant vitronectin. PCR-amplified DNA was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector, PVL1392 (Pharmingen), using the restriction enzymes Not I and Xba I. Recombinant viruses were generated according to established procedures (42Lerch R.A. Friesen P.D.

Viral stocks were prepared using SF21 cells grown in serum-free SF900II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Supernatants from infected cells were collected 72 h postinfection. To purify the recombinant vitronectins, supernatants were treated with 8m urea for 2 h at 20 °C and passed over columns of heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Resins were washed with 130 mm NaCl, 4 m urea in 25 mmphosphate, pH 6.5, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.5m NaCl, 4 m urea in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8. The recombinant vitronectins were dialyzed extensively against PBS. Purity of the recombinant protein preparations was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were frozen at −80 °C until use. The 70-kDa fibronectin fragment was iodinated with 1.0 mCi of Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) using chloramine T as described previously (3McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, thrombospondin, anti-integrin antibodies, and FnIII9,10 were diluted to 10 μg/ml in PBS and coated onto 24-well tissue plates (Corning/Costar) for 3 h at 37 °C. Thrombospondin was reduced with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 20 °C prior to use (44Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen was coated onto culture plates at 100 μg/ml in PBS. Collagen was coated onto culture plates in 0.02 n acetic acid at 50 μg/ml at 4 °C overnight. Protein-coated wells were washed three times with PBS before use. To minimize endogenous fibronectin levels during experimental procedures, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and pretreated for 3.5 h with cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) (30McKeown-Longo P.J. Etzler C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in DMEM containing ITS+2 (Sigma) as described previously (15Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 105 cells/well in DMEM/ITS+2 with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide. Following an overnight incubation, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 1 h with 0.5 × 106 cpm/ml 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment (∼20 ng/well) in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (45McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion was quantitated in parallel wells by staining with 0.5% crystal violet as described previously (15Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For fibronectin matrix assembly assays, non-cycloheximide-treated fibroblasts were seeded onto fibronectin-coated coverslips in 12-well cluster dishes at 105 cells/well in DMEM/ITS+2 in the absence or presence of 1.7 μm GST/VnHBD, GST/FnIII12,13, or 0.75 μm recombinant vitronectin and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and fibronectin fibrils were visualized using a polyclonal anti-fibronectin antibody followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cappel). Cells were examined using an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with epifluorescence and photographed using a spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). To assay changes in actin distribution, confluent fibroblasts were washed with serum-free media and incubated overnight in serum-free DMEM. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed, and seeded onto fibronectin coverslips in 12-well cluster dishes at 1.5 × 104 cells/well in DMEM/ITS+2 in the absence or presence of 3.4 μm of GST/VnHBD, GST/FnIII12,13, or GST. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, actin filaments were visualized by staining fixed and permeabilized cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Vinculin was visualized using an anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma) followed by a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Cappel). To assay changes in the cellular distribution of α-actinin, talin, and vinculin, serum-starved, non-cycloheximide-treated fibroblast cells were fractionated into digitonin-soluble and -insoluble (cytoskeletal-associated) fractions (46Belkin A.M. Retta S.F. Pletjushkina O.Y. Balzac F. Silengo L. Fassler R. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 4 × 105 cell/well into fibronectin-coated six-well tissue culture plates in the absence or presence of 1.7 × 10−6m GST/VnHBD or GST/FnIII12,13. Following an overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated for 5 min on ice with 0.1% digitonin in 50 mm Hepes, pH 6.9, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EDTA, and inhibitors (10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmH2O2, 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Following removal of the digitonin-soluble fractions, cells were washed two times with PBS and incubated on ice with radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with 150 mm NaCl and inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were assayed for protein concentration using bicinchroninic acid (BCA) reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples (10 μg) were analyzed under nonreducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously (8Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19183-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The polymerization of a fibronectin matrix is a cell-dependent process that is regulated by the expression of specific matrix assembly sites on the surface of substrate-attached cells (2Mosher D.F. Sottile J. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 810-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These sites have been identified by radioligand binding assays using either 125I-labeled 70-kDa or125I-labeled 27-kDa fragments derived from the amino terminus of fibronectin (3McKeown-Longo P.J. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 364-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 4Quade B.J. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19602-19609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that cells adherent to vitronectin do not express matrix assembly sites (21Christopher R.A. Kowalczyk A.P. McKeown-Longo P.J. J.

To examine further the effect of extracellular matrix molecules on the expression of matrix assembly sites, cycloheximide-pretreated fibroblasts were allowed to adhere and spread on tissue culture wells coated with various adhesive proteins. Matrix assembly site expression on these cells was then measured in a 1-h binding assay using 125I-labeled 70-kDa fragment. Previous studies have identified a homophilic binding site for the amino terminus of fibronectin within the III1 module (8Hocking D.C. Sottile J. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, fibroblasts were also seeded onto the RGD-containing III9,10 modules of fibronectin, which mediate cell adhesion (9Hocking D.C. Smith R.K. McKeown-Longo P.J. J.

The initiator protein, DnaA, binds to four binding sites (DnaA boxes) forming a large nucleoprotein complex. This leads to the unwinding of an A + T-rich region at the origin. HU protein plays a critical role during this local unwinding step. The replicative helicase, DnaB, is introduced to this single-stranded region via a crucial protein-protein interaction between DnaA and DnaB (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J. J. Biol.

Subsequent additions of DnaG, the primase, and the replicative polymerase, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE),1 completes formation of the replication forks.Key protein-protein interactions have also been shown to be necessary for proper replication fork propagation. An interaction between DnaB and the τ subunit of the pol III HE is required for rapid replication fork movement (8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An interaction between the primase and the HE limits the size of the primers synthesized at the replication fork (11Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of the Okazaki fragments synthesized on the lagging strand template is governed by an interaction between DnaG and DnaB (12Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown previously that primase concentration affected the mode of DNA replication in oriC replication systems dramatically (14Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis and bidirectional initiation of replication at oriC occurred only at high concentrations of primase. We suggested that this reflected a requirement for primase to act during a “replication fork assembly” step that occurred subsequent to the loading of DnaB to the DNA, but prior to nascent chain elongation by pol III. The molecular basis of this step, however, was unclear. The high concentrations of primase involved implied the need to ensure occupancy of a binding site at a specified time, but binding could have been mediated by DnaB (12Tougu K. Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4675-4682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), DnaA (15Datta H.J. Khatri G.S. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), or a subunit of the HE (11Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this report we have continued our investigation of this effect. The role of these protein-protein interactions during initiation at oriC was investigated by using mutant primases defective in their interaction with DnaB and HE lacking the τ subunit. We show that proper bidirectional initiation depended only on accurate placement of the primers for leading strand synthesis that, in turn, depended only on the interaction between DnaB and DnaG.DISCUSSIONInitiation of DNA replication at chromosomal origins is a highly ordered process that requires identification of the origin sequence, localized denaturation of the origin region, and assembly of two replication forks that will subsequently replicate the chromosome, simultaneously synthesizing the nascent leading and lagging strands. In E. coli, the high degree of coordination demanded is specified by a sequential series of interactions between replication proteins.The initial protein to act in this cascade is DnaA, which recognizes, binds to, and locally denatures the origin (6Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1988; 54: 743-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 27Fuller R.S. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These events require extensive oligomerization of DnaA at the origin. The manner in which activities are assigned to individual protomers (or groups of them) in this DnaA aggregate is not yet appreciated. The single-stranded DNA in the resultant denaturation bubble is presumably rapidly coated with SSB. The key to subsequent replication fork assembly is the introduction of the replication fork helicase, DnaB, to the DNA. Avoidance of the promiscuous introduction of this protein to any single-stranded DNA in the cell comes about because DnaB cannot bind to SSB-coated DNA. This creates a demand for another specific interaction, this time between DnaA and DnaB (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that allows DnaB to bind the denaturation bubble.This point in the temporal sequence of events during initiation is crucial for the determination of the mode of replication. DnaB is a motor protein that can rapidly move away from the origin in an ATP-dependent manner. As we have shown previously for replication of small plasmid templates (14Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), if it does so before replication forks are established, synthesis of each strand becomes continuous and the location of initiation becomes random. We determined that a high concentration of primase was required to ensure that replication was, in fact, bidirectional, initiating at or very near oriC.Replication fork formation is driven by the obligatory development of an interaction between the τ subunit of the pol III HE and DnaB that acts to couple DNA synthesis to unwinding of the parental template (8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We sought to determine in this report whether the required high concentration of primase reflected a requirement for primer placement to facilitate establishment of the τ-DnaB interaction or a requirement to mark the origin region and the site of initiation of leading strand synthesis immediately upon localized denaturation, an event that would only be dependent on the DnaG-DnaB interaction. To address this question, we examined the mode of DNA replication in the presence of pol III HEs reconstituted both with and without the τ subunit and mutant primases that had altered interactions with DnaB.pol III HE reconstituted without the τ subunit could support oriC DNA replication in vitro. On its face, the observation that uncoupled replication forks could support DNA replication seems surprising. However, there is precedent in the mono- and dipolymerase systems for SV40 DNA replication in vitro (28Eki T. Matsumoto T. Murakami Y. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7284-7294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HE reconstituted in the absence of τ presumably synthesizes leading strands in a distributive manner, just as DNA polymerase α does in the monopolymerase system. However, it is probable that this observation is a manifestation of reconstituting DNA replication in vitro. The efficiency gain generated by the increased speed of replication fork progression as a result of the τ-DnaB interaction (8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) is likely to be required in vivo where a large amount of DNA must be duplicated in a short time. This time constraint is not operative in the in vitro system. Nevertheless, the ability to observe τ-independent oriC replication allowed us to determine that it was the DnaG-DnaB interaction that was governing the mode of replication initiation.An identical switch from asymmetric, randomly initiated replication to bidirectional replication in inverse relationship to the primase concentration was observed when oriC DNA replication was performed using HE reconstituted in either the presence or absence of τ, demonstrating that the lack of a DnaB-pol III HE interaction had no effect on oriC-specific initiation of bidirectional DNA replication that was dependent on the DnaB-DnaG interaction. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that mutant primases, having as their only defect an altered interaction with DnaB, behaved identically to the wild type with the only difference being a shift to the right in the concentration dependence of the switch in replication mode. This also argues against the possibility that it is an interaction between DnaA and DnaG that locates the primase to the origin region. If this were the case, the shift in concentration of primase required to alter the mode of replication when the mutant enzymes were used would not have been observed.The dominance of the DnaB-DnaG interaction in directing the mode of replication from oriC suggests that it is the location of the first primers synthesized that is the governing feature. These are the primers for leading strand synthesis. How this results in essentially assuring that bidirectional initiation takes place is not clear. It could be that, even if only one replication fork initiates, the second leading strand primer serves as a roadblock to conversion to rolling-circle DNA synthesis. Another intriguing, although highly speculative, possibility is that this reflects a requirement for the formation of a dimeric replisome at the origin, resulting in the coupling of the two replication forks, as has been proposed for initiation at the SV40 origin (29Wessel R. Schweizer J. Stahl H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 804-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA replication in Escherichia coli initiates at a unique site, oriC, proceeds bidirectionally around the circular chromosome, and ends in the terminus region, 180° away from oriC (1Prescott D.M. Kuempel P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 2842-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 2Bird R.E. Louarn J. Martuscelli J. Caro L. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 70: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Initiation and termination of DNA replication are tightly regulated to ensure coupling of chromosomal replication to the cell cycle (3Zyskind J.W. Smith D.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Kornberg and co-workers have reconstituted oriC DNA replication in vitro with purified proteins and small plasmid templates, defining the molecular mechanisms of initiation of DNA replication (4Kaguni J.M. Kornberg A. Cell. 1984; 38: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Funnell B.E. Baker T.A. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

The initiator protein, DnaA, binds to four binding sites (DnaA boxes) forming a large nucleoprotein complex. This leads to the unwinding of an A + T-rich region at the origin. HU protein plays a critical role during this local unwinding step. The replicative helicase, DnaB, is introduced to this single-stranded region via a crucial protein-protein interaction between DnaA and DnaB (7Marszalek J. Kaguni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4883-4890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent additions of DnaG, the primase, and the replicative polymerase, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE),1 completes formation of the replication forks. Key protein-protein interactions have also been shown to be necessary for proper replication fork propagation. An interaction between DnaB and the τ subunit of the pol III HE is required for rapid replication fork movement (8Kim S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 643-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and defines which of the two core polymerases of the HE becomes the leading strand polymerase (9Kim S.

To further our understanding of the functional significance of APLP2 in wound healing, we have measured the migratory response of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing APLP2 isoforms to a variety of extracellular matrix components including laminin, collagen types I, IV, and VII, fibronectin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). CHO cells overexpressing either of two APLP2 variants, differing in chondroitin sulfate (CS) attachment, exhibit a marked increase in chemotaxis toward type IV collagen and fibronectin but not to laminin, collagen types I and VII, and HSPGs. Cells overexpressing APLP2-751 (CS-modified) exhibited a greater migratory response to fibronectin and type IV collagen than their non-CS-attached counterparts (APLP2-763), suggesting that CS modification enhanced APLP2 effects on cell migration. Moreover, in the presence of chondroitin sulfate, transfectants overexpressing APLP2-751 failed to exhibit this enhanced migration toward fibronectin. The APLP2-ECM interactions were also explored by solid phase adhesion assays. While overexpression of APLP2 isoforms moderately enhanced CHO adhesion to laminin, collagen types I and VII, and HSPGs lines, especially those overexpressing APLP2-751, exhibited greatly increased adhesion to type IV collagen and fibronectin. These observations suggest that APLP2 contributes to re-epithelialization during wound healing by supporting epithelial cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen IV, thus influencing their capacity to migrate over the wound bed. Furthermore, APLP2 interactions with fibronectin and collagen IV appear to be potentiated by the addition of a CS chain to the core proteins.

Members of the APP/APLP family are type I integral membrane proteins that contain a single membrane-spanning domain with a large extracellular N-terminal domain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (1Kang J.

Tanzi R.E. Nature Genet. 1993; 5: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Both APP and APLP2 are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and cells and their in vivo roles largely remain to be determined (6Selkoe D. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 373-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 7Sisodia S. Price D. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). APP and APLP2 are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs (2Wasco W. Gurubhagavatula S. Paradis M.D. Romano D.M. Sisodia S.S. Hyman B.T. Neve R.L. Tanzi R.E.

Schmaier A. Neiditch B. Siege R. Raschke W. Sisodia S. Wagner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1209: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The other spliced exon encodes a 15- (APP) or 12- (APLP2) amino acid insert that disrupts a consensus sequence required for the addition of a chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain (9Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16522-16525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 10Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the isoforms of APP and APLP2 lacking these small polypeptide inserts are subject to CS modification. We previously showed that the majority of APLP2 molecules in rat corneal epithelium and in olfactory sensory axons are modified by the addition of a CS glycosaminoglycan (CSPG) chain (11Guo J. Thinakaran G. Guo Y. Sisodia S. Yu F. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 292-300PubMed Google Scholar, 12Thinakaran G. Kitt C. Roskams A. Slunt H. Masliah E. Koch C.V. Ginsberg S. Ronnett G. Reed R. Price D. Sisodia S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6314-6326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following wounding, the levels of APLP2 mRNA and protein are increased markedly in the basal epithelial cells that are actively migrating (11Guo J. Thinakaran G. Guo Y. Sisodia S. Yu F. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 292-300PubMed Google Scholar), implicating a role(s) for APLP2 in mediating epithelial migration during re-epithelialization. Cell migration plays a central role in many biological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, immunoresponses, and tumor metastasis. Cell migration requires a dynamic interaction between the cell, its substrate, and the cytoskeleton-associated motile apparatus (13Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 14Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Cell surface adhesion receptors serve to connect the substratum with the cytoskeleton, and thus they are central to the migratory process (14Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The best characterized cell surface receptors for matrix components are the integrin family of proteins (15Hynes R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). Integrins play a key role in cell migration, both as receptors connecting the ECM to intracellular cytoskeletal proteins and as receptors transducing information from ECM to affect cell behavior (15Hynes R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar,16Yamada K. Gailit J. Clark R. Clark R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Press, New York1996: 51-93Google Scholar). Another group of cell surface molecules capable of binding ECM components are cell surface proteoglycans including the syndecans, CD44 and NG2. Syndecans, via their covalently attached heparan sulfate chains, bind fibronectin (FN), interstitial collagens, thrombospondin, and tenascin (17Thesleff I. Vainio S. Salmivirta M. Jalkanen M. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 32: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 19Corless C.L. Mendoza A. Collins T. Lawler J. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Syndecans are thought to play important roles in cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (20Carey D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). CD44 binds several ECM components including hyaluronan (21Clark R.A. Alon R. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1075-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), FN (22Verfaillie C.M. Benis A. Iida J. McGlave P.B. McCarthy J.B. Blood. 1994; 84: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen type IV (23Knutson J.R. Iida J. Fields G.B. McCarthy J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and it is linked to the cytoskeleton by ezrin (24Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) and ankyrin (25Bourguignon L. Lokeshwar V. He J. Chen X. Bourguignon G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4464-4467Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another cell surface CSPG is NG2 (26Iida J. Meijne A.M. Spiro R.C. Roos E. Furcht L.T. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2177-2185PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lin X. Dahlin-Huppe K. Stallcup W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 463-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). NG2-expressing B28 glioma cells exhibited a greater migratory response toward type VI collagen than do non-NG2 expressing cells (28Burg M. Nishiyama A. Stallcup W. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These cell surface proteins, by serving as adhesion molecules, are thought to promote cell migration during normal development, in vitro tumor invasion, and wound repair. The APP family of proteins is known to interact with selected ECM proteins such as heparin sulfate proteoglycan (29Narindrasorasak S. Lowery D. Gonzalez D.P. Poorman R.A. Greenberg B. Kisilevsky R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 10: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), laminin (30Narindrasorasak S. Lowery D.E. Altman R.A. Gonzalez D.P.A. Greenberg B.D. Kisilevsky R. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 144: 46-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), FN (31Narindrasorasak S. Altman R.A. Gonzalez D.P. Greenberg B.D. Kisilevsky R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 272-282PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen (32Beher D. Hesse L. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1613-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). APP has also been shown to promote adhesion of a number of cell types in culture (33Chen M. Yankner B. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 125: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Breen K.C. Bruce M. Anderton B.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 28: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 35Ghiso J. Rostagno A. Gardella J.E. Liem L. Gorevic P.D. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the APP family of proteins might be components of a multidimensional mechanism for the regulation of spatial and temporal cell-matrix interactions during tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. To investigate the role of APLP2 in cell adhesion and cell migration, we analyzed Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines overexpressing APLP2 isoforms and report in this article that APLP2 overexpression caused a significant increase in migratory response of CHO cells to FN and type IV collagen. The ability of APLP2 transfectants to migrate toward FN and type IV collagen is closely related to the increases in cell adhesion to these ECM proteins. These findings suggest that APLP2-ECM interaction may play a functional role in cell behavior. They also provide support for APLP2 to function in epithelial wound healing. Because the APP family of proteins is highly conserved and similarly processed (2Wasco W. Gurubhagavatula S. Paradis M.D. Romano D.M. Sisodia S.S. Hyman B.T. Neve R.L. Tanzi R.E. Nature Genet. 1993; 5: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), information about the biology of APLP2 should add to our knowledge regarding the functional role of these proteins. CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (complete medium). The stable CHO lines expressing APLP2-751 and APLP2-763 were generated by co-transfecting APLP2 expression vector pSVAPLP2-751 (10Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pSVAPLP2-763 (9Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16522-16525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with a neovector, respectively, and were maintained in complete DMEM containing 200 μg/ml Geneticin. Three APLP2-751-transfected cell lines, B2, C1, and D1 (10Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and three APLP2-763-transfected cell lines D + 127, 8, and 16 were used. For control, untransfected parental and mock-transfected CHO cells were used. Cells were allowed to grow to confluence in 25-cm2 flasks. The conditioned medium from each cell line was collected and cells were then washed twice with PBS. To determine relative levels of APLP2 in transfectants, CHO cells were lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml pepstatin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove nuclei and insoluble debris. Protein concentration was determined using Pierce Micro BCA Protein assay Reagent kit. Ten-microgram aliquots of detergent lysates were digested with 0.05 unit of protease-free chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Inc., Rockville, MD) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 30 mm sodium acetate for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and the blots were probed with 1:2500 dilution of APLP2-specific antiserum, D2II (5Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Von Koch C. Lo A.C. Tanzi R.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2637-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (goat anti-rabbit, Bio-Rad; 1:1000) as a secondary antibody and the Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence System (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) for detection. To detect APLP2 at the cell surface, monolayer CHO cells in 100 mm-tissue culture dishes were washed three times with PBS and incubated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce Chemical) at 200 μg/ml, 5 min at room temperature. After biotinylation, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS/glycine and twice with ice-cold PBS and then scraped from the culture dishes and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS with proteinase inhibitors. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min to yield low speed pellets. The supernatant was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge to yield a cytosolic fraction and high speed pellet containing membrane-associate proteins. The low and high speed pellets were resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100. The biotinylated proteins were precipitated with avidin-agarose (Pierce Chemical) overnight at 4 °C. After five washes in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, biotinylated proteins were released from avidin-agarose by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cell surface APLP2 was detected by Western blotting as described above. To determine the ratio of modified/non-modified APLP2, the image of autoradiograph was captured by the BDS Image System and analyzed by NIH Image 1.55-Gel Plotting Micros. Each desired band was marked; the image was acquired and plotted. The area beneath each plotted curve (APLP2 band intensity) was automatically calculated. Human plasma FN, laminin, and type I collagen were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ); types IV and VII collagen and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) were purchased from Sigma. Migration assays were carried out in 12- or 48-well Neuroprobe chemotaxis chambers (Cabin John, MD). CHO cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed once with PBS + 10% FCS, and then washed twice with DMEM. Cells were resuspended in DMEM + 0.1% BSA and then added to the upper chamber (1.8 × 104 cells for 12-well chambers and at 8 × 103 cells for 48-well chambers). For blocking assay, chondroitin sulfate were preincubated with the cells before they were added to the upper compartment of the Boyden chamber. The lower compartment was filled with either DMEM containing 0.1% BSA as control, or with various extracellular matrix proteins at 20 μg/ml (Fig. 2). For subsequent fibronectin and collagen IV studies, 10 μg/ml protein or as otherwise indicated (see figure legends) were used. The two compartments of the Boyden chamber were separated by a polycarbonate filter (8 mm pore size, Poretics, Livermore, CA). Cells were allowed to migrate for 2–10 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The membranes were briefly fixed with methanol and stained with Diff Quick Stain (Dade Diagnostics, Aguada, Puerto Rico). Cells on the upper side of the filter were removed mechanically. The filters were mounted on glass slides and the number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface were counted or photographed and then counted on the micrograph. A random microscope field (× 200 magnification) was counted per well. Each assay was carried out in 12 wells and repeated at least once. Conditioned medium from CHO B2 cells was obtained from a confluent CHO culture (100-mm dish) that was maintained in 6 ml of serum-free medium (Opti-DMEM, Life Sciences) for 24 h. Under this condition, the maximum amount of secreted APLP2-751 molecules was accumulated in the media. One milliliter of collected medium was dialyzed twice against 200 ml of DMEM + 0.1% BSA. The dialyzed medium was used to resuspend CHO cells and added to the lower chamber to determine the effects of secreted APLP2 molecules on cell migration. Purified matrix proteins (10 μg/ml, Fig. 7) tested included collagen I, collagen IV, collagen VII, FN, laminin, and HSPG. To test concentration dependence, 0.5–10 μg/ml fibronectin or collagen IV was used with 1% BSA as control. Matrix proteins were diluted in PBS and 100-μl aliquots were added to the wells of Nunc-Immuno plates. Proteins were allowed to absorb overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed three times with PBS and nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h with 1% BSA in PBS at 37 °C. Cells were detached by treatment with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, washed once with 10% serum in PBS, twice with serum-free DMEM, and then suspended in serum-free DMEM containing 1% BSA, and added to the plates (104 cells/well). Plates were kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 for 0, 30, and 60 min and then washed twice with PBS to remove unbound cells. Attached cells were fixed with 75% ethanol, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol, 80% water for 20 min each. Excess dye was removed by rinsing the plates with PBS. Bound stain was extracted with 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.2, for 30 min and the optical density (OD) was read at 570 nm in a microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Bio-Tek Instrument, Winooski, VT). The background OD value from a control well with DMEM + 1% BSA was subtracted from the OD values for each well. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to determine if there was a significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05). When multiple means were compared, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare means between arms of each experiment. If found to be significant (p < 0.01), Scheffe's multiple comparison procedure was performed to compute adjusted p values for pairwise comparisons (e.g. CHO versus APLP2-751, CHO versus APLP2-763, and APLP2-751 versus APLP2-763). Naive CHO cells express detectable levels of APLP2 molecules. We previously reported that permanent CHO cell lines transfected with cDNAs encoding mouse APLP2-751 and APLP2-763 have markedly increased levels of APLP2 (see Refs. 9Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H.

Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 292-300PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cell lines overexpressing APLP2 also release ectodomain fragments derived from corresponding APLP2 precursor isoforms into the conditioned media (10Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22099-22104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface localization of APLP2 in CHO transfectants was determined by experiments in which cell surface proteins were biotinylated briefly (5 min at room temperature) and precipitated with avidin-agarose from high speed pellet or cytosol fractions (Fig.1). While no APLP2 immunoreactivity was detected in cytosol, APLP2 was detected for three cell lines at the surface of live CHO cells (Fig. 1, membrane, lanes 1, 2, and 3). The levels of APLP2 in the fraction of cell surface proteins from APLP2 transfectants (Fig. 1, cell line D + 1216, lanes 2 and line B2, lane 3) were markedly higher than that from untransfected cells (lane 1). Band intensity analysis with original x-ray film revealed in lane 3 (membrane) ∼60% of APLP2 staining was in ∼120–200 kDa (CS modified) forms. Similar results were obtained when biotinylation was performed at 4 °C for 30 min (data not shown).Figure 1Immunoblot detection of cell surface APLP2. To detect cell surface APLP2, CHO cells without transfection (lane 1), transfected with APLP2-763 (line D + 1216, lane 2) or APLP2-751 (line B2, lane 3) from one confluent 100-mm tissue culture dish were surface biotinylated. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated from subcellular fractions (cytosol, 100,000 × g supernatant; membrane, 100,000 × g pellet) with avidin-Sepharose and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. APLP2 was detected by immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal APLP2 antiserum D2II (1:1000 dilution) using enhanced chemiluminescence. The positions of molecular markers (myosin, 202 kDa; β-galactosidase, 109 kDa) are indicated at the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our in vivo wound healing study suggested that APLP2 isoforms might be involved in mediating epithelial sheet migration (11Guo J. Thinakaran G. Guo Y. Sisodia S. Yu F. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1998; 39: 292-300PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether APLP2 affects the ability CHO cells to migrate in response to ECM proteins, we used Boyden chamber assays to compare the relative ability of parental or mock-transfected cells, cells overexpressing APLP2-763 (non-CS-modified) and cells overexpressing APLP2-751 (CS-modified) to migrate toward a variety of ECM components (Fig.2). For these assays, ECM proteins were placed in the lower chamber of the Boyden apparatus to serve as a soluble chemoattractant. As shown in Fig. 2, ECM proteins collagen type I and VII, laminin, and HSPG had low stimulative effects on CHO cell migration. Overexpression of APLP2 did not alter the migratory response of CHO cells toward these proteins. On the other hand, while the control cells exhibited low migratory responses to type IV collagen, APLP2-transfected cell lines exhibited significantly increased migration toward this basement membrane-specific collagen (p < 0.0001). We observed approximately 1.7 times more cells crossing the membrane for APLP2-763 cells and ∼3.6 times more for cells expressing APLP2-751, compared with control CHO cells. Among the ECM proteins tested, FN had the highest stimulatory effects on CHO migration. CHO cells overexpressing APLP2 displayed markedly enhanced migration toward FN (p < 0.0001), being 1.8 times greater for APL-763 and 2.5 times greater for APLP2-751 cells when compared with parental or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2). Furthermore, while overexpression of both isoforms of APLP2 promoted CHO cell migration toward collagen IV and FN, cells overexpressing APLP2-751 exhibited a significantly greater (∼2.1 times toward collagen IV and ∼1.4 times toward FN, p < 0.0001) migratory response to these ECM proteins than those overexpressing APLP2–763. Several lines overexpressing each isoform were generated. Although these cell lines expressed different levels of APLP2 as determined by chondroitinase digestion and Western blotting (Fig.3 A), all cell lines expressing the same isoform (lines D + 127, 8 and 16 expressing APLP2-763; lines B2, C1, and D1 expressing APLP2-751) exhibited similar levels of enhanced cell migration toward FN (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the migratory response of these cell lines correlates with the isoform expressed but not with the levels of APLP2 overexpression. Fig. 4 shows migration of CHO cells toward different concentrations of FN. All three cell lines exhibited increasing migration with increasing FN concentration. The pattern of APLP2 isoforms promoting CHO migration, APLP2-751 > APLP2-763 > control cells, was observed at all concentrations tested. Fig. 5 shows that the increased migration of APLP2-transfected CHO cell lines, when compared with control cells, toward type IV collagen can be observed within the first 2 h in the modified Boyden chamber assays, but was more obvious after longer incubations (6–10 h). This effect was much more pronounced in cells overexpressing CS-modified APLP2 molecules.Figure 5Time course of migration toward type IV collagen of CHO cells expressing APLP2 isoforms. Cell migration assays were performed for control (Δ) and two cell lines expressing APLP2 isoforms (⋄, APLP2–751 line B2; ○, APLP2-763 line D + 1216) using 10 μg/ml type IV collagen. After various times as indicated, cells that migrated to the underside of the membrane were quantified. The results are averages of at least 12 random fields; error bars show standard errors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether CS modification contributes to the effects of APLP2 molecules on promoting CHO cell migration, we preincubated cell suspensions with chondroitin sulfate (20 μg/ml) before adding cells to the upper chambers in the migration assays (Fig.6). Clearly, chondroitin sulfate interfered with FN-mediated migration of CHO cells expressing CS-APLP2 (2.84 times reduction, p < 0.005), but had no effect on parental or cells expressing APLP2-763. These results suggest that modification of APLP2 by addition of CS chains potentiates the effects of APLP2 core protein on CHO cell migration"
https://openalex.org/W2051004568,"Epidermal growth factor stimulates migration of a number of cell types, yet the signaling pathways that regulate epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration are poorly defined. In this report, we employ a transient transfection migration assay to assess the role of components of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway in epidermal growth factor-stimulated chemotaxis of rat embryo fibroblasts. Expression of dominant negative Ras blocks epidermal growth factor-mediated chemotaxis, while constitutively active Ras has no effect on chemokinesis or chemotaxis. PD98059 and U0126, inhibitors of MAP kinase kinase (MEK) activity, decreased epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration, while kinase-defective MEK1, an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation, enhanced migration. To understand the paradoxical effects of these molecules on epidermal growth factor-induced migration, we examined the role of c-Raf on migration. Expression of either wild type c-Raf or the catalytic domain of c-Raf effectively inhibited epidermal growth factor-stimulated cell migration. We suggest that, whereas Ras activity is necessary to promote epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration, sustained activation of c-Raf may be important in down-regulating migratory signaling pathways triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor activation. Further, activation of c-Raf upon inhibition of the MEK-MAP kinase pathway may contribute to the inhibition of cell migration observed with pharmacological MEK inhibitors.

PD98059 and U0126, inhibitors of MAP kinase kinase (MEK) activity, decreased epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration, while kinase-defective MEK1, an inhibitor of MAP kinase activation, enhanced migration. To understand the paradoxical effects of these molecules on epidermal growth factor-induced migration, we examined the role of c-Raf on migration. Expression of either wild type c-Raf or the catalytic domain of c-Raf effectively inhibited epidermal growth factor-stimulated cell migration. We suggest that, whereas Ras activity is necessary to promote epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration, sustained activation of c-Raf may be important in down-regulating migratory signaling pathways triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor activation. Further, activation of c-Raf upon inhibition of the MEK-MAP kinase pathway may contribute to the inhibition of cell migration observed with pharmacological MEK inhibitors. epidermal growth factor extracellular matrix EGF receptor phospholipase Cγ mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase platelet-derived growth factor rat embryo fibroblasts bovine serum albumin phosphate-buffered serum phosphoinositide 3-kinase green fluorescent protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium hemagglutinin Regulated cell migration is physiologically important for embryonic development, wound healing, and immunological responses associated with inflammation. Moreover, unregulated migration is a central feature of some pathological states, most notably tumor metastasis. While it is clear that regulating cell migration is important for homeostasis of an organism, the signal transduction events that regulate motility are poorly defined. Cells can be stimulated to move toward soluble factors (chemotaxis) including growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF),1 or substrate-bound components (haptotaxis), typically ECM. EGF binding to its cell surface receptor elicits signal transduction pathways that culminate in migration (1Manske M. Bade E.G. Int. Rev.

It has been reported that EGF-stimulated migration requires receptor tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation induced upon EGF binding (2Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J.

Cells treated with the pharmacological PLC inhibitor, U73122, or expressing a mutant EGFR incapable of activating PLCγ fail to migrate to EGF indicating that PLCγ activity is necessary for migration in response to EGF (3Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Binding of Grb2 and/or Shc to the activated EGFR stimulates the Ras → Raf → MEK → ERK1/ERK2 (MAP kinase) signal transduction pathway (4Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Several groups have investigated the role of this pathway in cell motility. In particular, Ras activity appears to be indispensable for cell motility in a number of systems (9Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R.

Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of dominant interfering Ras proteins inhibits chemokinesis, PDGF-stimulated migration (13Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and wound repair (15Sosnowski R.G. Feldman S. Feramisco J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, expression of dominant negative Ras is reported to have no effect on haptotactic migration toward fibronectin (13Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The role of MAP kinase in mediating steps necessary for migration is somewhat less clear. Haptotactic migration of FG pancreatic carcinoma cells or Rat1 fibroblasts to collagen or fibronectin, respectively, can be blocked by the MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059 (17Klemke R.L. Cai S.

Such migration can be stimulated by ectopically expressed constitutively active MEK, suggesting a regulatory role for MAP kinase in haptotaxis (17Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L.

PDGF-stimulated chemotaxis of Rat1 fibroblasts was unaffected by PD98059 treatment, implying that MAP kinase is not necessary for PDGF-mediated migration (18Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Viswanathan A. Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Ruggieri R. Symons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30688-30692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Recent reports have indicated that EGF-stimulated MAP kinase activation is not sufficient to promote migration of mouse NR6 cells expressing the EGFR (3Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, treatment of these cells with PD98059 inhibits EGF-stimulated migration, suggesting that MAP kinase is necessary for migration to occur (19Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we employed a transient transfection migration assay to assess the role of components of the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAP kinase signaling pathway in EGF-stimulated REF52 cell migration. As reported previously, treatment of cells with PD98059 inhibited EGF-stimulated cell migration. However, additional experiments showed that overexpression of catalytically inactive MEK stimulated EGF-induced migration, whereas the overexpression of activated MEK failed to stimulate cell migration. Catalytically inactive MEK binds to and titrates c-Raf away from endogenous substrates while the pharmacological MEK inhibitors increase c-Raf activity. These observations prompted examination of the role of c-Raf in the regulation of EGF induced cell migration. We show that overexpression of either wild type c-Raf or activated c-Raf consistently inhibited EGF-induced cell migration of REF52 cells. We conclude that, whereas Ras activity is necessary to promote EGF-stimulated migration, the sustained activation of c-Raf in REF52 cells may be important in down-regulating the migratory signaling pathways triggered by EGF receptor activation. REF52 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 μg/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.25 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). EGF (Sigma) was reconstituted in DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma). PDGF-BB (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was reconstituted in 4 mm HCl, 0.1% BSA. PD98059 (Biomol) and U0126 (Promega), MEK inhibitors, were reconstituted in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 50 μm. U73122 (Biomol), a PLC inhibitor, and the inactive congener U73433 (Biomol) were reconstituted in chloroform and stored at −20 °C. Aliquots were dried under a nitrogen stream, resuspended in DMEM containing 1% fatty acid-free BSA, and used immediately at a final concentration of 1 μm. Wortmannin (Sigma), herbimycin (Calbiochem), and genistein (Life Technologies, Inc.) were reconstituted in Me2SO and used at final concentrations of 100 nm, 875 nm, and 100 μg/ml, respectively. All constructs in this study utilized a cytomegalovirus promoter to drive expression of a peptide-epitope-tagged protein. HA-tagged A17Ras, N17Ras, and L61Ras (20Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Burstein E.S. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9410-9415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were kind gifts of R. Mattingly and I. Macara (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA); HA-tagged V12Ras, cloned into pDCR, was supplied by M. Wigler (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY); FLAG-tagged wild type c-Raf, activated c-Raf (22W) (22Chow Y.-H. Pumiglia K. Jun T.H. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14100-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the empty vector pC were a gift of R. Jove (University of South Florida, Tampa, FL). The empty vector for A17Ras, N17Ras, and L61Ras constructs, pKH, was generated by digesting A17Ras with Bam HI and Eco RI, followed by religation to remove A17Ras coding sequence. Wild type MEK1, activated MEK1 (S218/222D), and kinase-defective MEK1 (K97A) subcloned into pCMVHA have been described previously (23Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged ERK2 was constructed by digesting murine erk2 in pBluescript with Hin dIII and Xba I and subcloning into the same sites in pcDNA3-FLAG. Extraneous pBluescript sequence between the Hin dIII site and the erk2 start site was removed using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) and an oligonucleotide spanning the FLAG coding sequence and the erk2 start site. 2S. Eblen, unpublished data. The GFP expression plasmid, pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), was used as a transfection control. For migration assays, cells (0.5–1.0 × 106/100-mm dish) were transfected with 10 μg of DNA in a 4:1 ratio of expression plasmid to GFP (which identifies positively transfected cells) using 60 μl of Superfect (Qiagen). Between 24 and 48 h after the addition of DNA, the transfection efficiency was determined by calculating the ratio of GFP-positive cells to total cells (counted in four random (magnification, ×320) fields using a Ziess Axiovert 135TV inverted fluorescence microscope). Migration of transfected cells was assessed using the Boyden chamber assay described below. For activity assays, 0.5–1.0 × 106 cells, seeded on 100-mm dishes, were transfected with 9.9 μg of mutant MEK1 DNA and 0.1 μg of FLAG-ERK2 or 9.9 μg of mutant c-Raf DNA and 0.1 μg of wild type MEK1. Twenty-four to 48 h later, the cells were stimulated, harvested, and used for protein kinase assays described previously (23Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.-J. Reuter C.W.M. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Co-expression of individual constructs together with GFP was confirmed by transfecting 2.5–5 × 104 cells plated on coverslips in 35-mm dishes with 2 μg of total DNA in a 4:1 ratio of test construct to GFP using 10 μl of Superfect (Qiagen). Twenty-four to 48 h later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells transfected with individual test constructs and GFP were stained with monoclonal antibodies to the peptide tag expressed on each ectopically expressed protein (12CA5 for HA-tagged Ras and MEK, M2 (Sigma) for FLAG-tagged c-Raf) at a final concentration of 1.5–5 μg/ml. Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody at a final concentration of 1.5–2 μg/ml. The number of cells expressing both green (GFP) and red (test protein) fluorescence was determined by counting four random 400× magnification fields using a Leitz DMR fluorescence microscope. Co-expression frequency of each test construct and GFP was always greater than 80%. Cell migration was assessed using modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5 mm diameter, 10 μm thickness, 8 μm pores; BioCoat, Becton Dickinson). For growth factor-mediated chemotaxis, the indicated concentrations of EGF or 6.7 ng/ml PDGF-BB were placed in the lower chamber in DMEM in the absence of serum (DMEM/0). To assess fibronectin stimulated haptotaxis, the underside of the membrane was coated with 1.5 μg/ml fibronectin suspended in PBS in the lower chamber and PBS was placed in the upper chamber. After incubating the chambers overnight at 4 °C, the fibronectin solutions were removed and DMEM/0 was added to each chamber. For adhesion assays, 2.5 × 104 cells were plated on either uncoated 24-well plates or plates coated with 1.5 μg/ml fibronectin overnight at 4 °C and allowed to adhere for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, and washed twice with PBS. For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with each inhibitor for 15 min (16 h for herbimycin) prior to harvest. The inhibitor remained in both chambers of each well for the duration of the migration assay. Migration assays were performed by suspending 1 × 105REF52 cells in DMEM/0 in the upper chamber and allowing the cells to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C. Nonmigrating cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the underside of the membrane were washed twice in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, and washed twice with PBS. Migration or adhesion was assessed by counting four 320× fields of cells using a Ziess Axiovert 135TV inverted fluorescence microscope. Nontransfected cells were stained with crystal violet prior to counting to aid in visualization. For experiments using transfected cells, the number of fluorescent and total cells that migrated (observed by phase microscopy without counter staining) were determined and used to calculate the percentage of fluorescent cells that migrated. This percentage was normalized to the transfection efficiency for each construct to obtain the “relative migratory index.” The data presented represent the mean ± standard deviation. Each experimental group was analyzed using single-factor analysis of variance. If the global F test for differences among any one of the groups was significant at the 5% level, we proceeded to investigate which transfected group(s) differed from vector controls using Student's t tests assuming unequal variance. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. EGF has been reported to stimulate migration of many normal and tumorigenic cells (1Manske M. Bade E.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 155: 49-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), including NR6 fibroblasts engineered to express exogenous EGFR (2Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To identify signals that regulate EGF-stimulated migration of the normal rat embryo fibroblasts, REF52, we determined the optimal concentration of EGF required to stimulate migration of these cells. Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C in response to increasing concentrations of EGF placed in the lower well of a Boyden chamber (Fig. 1). The maximal, 2-fold increase in migration was induced with 3–10 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 1). Higher, mitogenic concentrations of EGF (25 ng/ml; Fig. 1) failed to stimulate migration significantly above background levels, consistent with reports of PDGF-stimulated migration (24Abedi H. Dawes K.E. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11367-11376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). EGF-stimulated NR6 migration requires EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity (2Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) as well as PLCγ activity (3Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We assessed the requirement for these activities, as well as PI3K activity, in EGF-stimulated migration of REF52 using pharmacological inhibitors. Treatment of REF52 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein or herbimycin completely inhibited chemokinesis and EGF-mediated chemotaxis (data not shown), thereby supporting the previous report of a requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation (2Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Treatment of REF52 cells with 1 μm U73122, a PLC inhibitor, blocked EGF-stimulated migration (Table I) while having no effect on chemokinesis (data not shown). The inactive congener U73433, had no effect on cell migration. Finally, cells treated with PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002, failed to inhibit EGF-stimulated migration (Table I) at concentrations that blocked PDGF-stimulated migration (data not shown). These experiments support the previously reported requirement for PLC activation in EGF-stimulated cell migration and interestingly fail to provide evidence for a significant role of PI3K.Table IEGF-mediated chemotaxis of REF52 cells in the presence of metabolic inhibitorsStimulantInhibitorTargetRelative migration1-aRepresents mean number of cells that migrate in response to EGF (+ or − inhibitor) normalized to Me2SO-treated, mock-stimulated controls ± standard deviation for 3–6 independent measurements.p 1-bp values are determined using a paired t test comparing EGF-stimulated, Me2SO-treated samples to Me2SO-treated, unstimulated control.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and Table I) as well as receptor-mediated PLCγ activation (Ref. 3Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and Table I), we sought to determine which components of the EGF receptor signaling pathway regulated migration. Previous reports have implicated Ras as a regulator of cell migration (9Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Science. 1986; 233: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 10Bar-Sagi D. McCormick F.

Cole G.E. Innis M. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Hall A. McCormick F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, we employed a transient transfection migration assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) to assess the effects of mutant Ras expression on EGF-stimulated migration. REF52 cells were transfected with mutant Ras constructs; the transfected cells were harvested 24–48 h later, and cell migration to 10 ng/ml EGF was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both EGF-mediated chemotaxis and chemokinesis of REF52 cells expressing dominant negative Ras (A17Ras or N17Ras) were reduced compared with cells expressing an empty vector control (pKH; Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, expression of constitutively active Ras had no effect on chemokinesis or EGF-stimulated motility (Fig. 2, A and B). Overexpression of A17Ras or N17Ras had no significant effect on fibronectin-stimulated migration (Fig. 2 C), indicating that dominant negative Ras likely blocks migration by affecting EGFR-regulated signaling rather than direct inhibition of components of the migration machinery. Dominant negative Ras expression also had no effect on cell adhesion (Fig. 2 D). Western analysis indicated that Ras expression in REF52 cells was equivalent among the mutant Ras constructs (data not shown). In parallel experiments, expression of N17Ras and V12Ras in REF52 cells effectively blocked PDGF-stimulated migration in agreement with previous reports (data not shown; Ref. 13Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that a Ras-dependent signal is required for EGF-mediated migration. To identify Ras effectors that may mediate chemotaxis in response to EGF, we examined molecular components of the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAP kinase pathway. Initially, we tested the effects of PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK activation (25Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar), on EGF-stimulated migration of REF52 cells. Cells pretreated for 15 min with 50 μm PD98059 or Me2SO were stimulated to migrate to 10 ng/ml EGF in the continued presence or absence of inhibitor. PD98059 decreased EGF-stimulated cell migration to levels comparable with chemokinesis (Table I). U0126, an inhibitor of MEK activation and MEK catalytic activity (26Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magnolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), inhibited EGF-stimulated migration as well as chemokinesis (Table I; data not shown). These data are consistent with a role for MEK in EGF-stimulated migration. To further explore the requirement for MEK1 activation in migration, expression constructs encoding kinase-defective MEK1, activated MEK1 or the empty vector control (pCHA) were co-transfected into REF52 cells with GFP-expressing plasmids and EGF-stimulated migration of transfected cells was assessed (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, kinase-defective MEK1 expression enhanced EGF-stimulated migration 2-fold while having no effect on chemokinesis (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, activated MEK1 had no significant effect on chemokinesis or chemotaxis (Fig. 3, A and B), and neither of the mutant MEK1 constructs affected adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 3 C). The enzymatic activities of kinase-defective and activated MEK1 constructs were confirmed by measuring the activity of co-expressed FLAG-ERK2 (Fig. 3 D). As anticipated, kinase-defective MEK1 inhibited EGF-stimulated ERK2 activity approximately 50% while activated MEK1 increased ERK2 activity approximately 4–5-fold in unstimulated cells. These data indicate that MEK-dependent activation of MAP kinase is not sufficient for EGF-stimulated migration of REF52 cells. Since kinase-defective MEK titrates c-Raf away from endogenous substrates, the paradoxical effects of the pharmacological MEK inhibitors and kinase-defective MEK on cell migration indicated the possible involvement of c-Raf in both the regulation of MEK/MAP kinase activation and cell migration. Recently, it has been shown that PD98059, in addition to blocking ERK activity, increases c-Raf activity in Swiss 3T3 cells treated with a number of stimuli (27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3242) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effects of PD98059 and a second MEK inhibitor, U0126, on c-Raf activity in REF52 cells. Cells were pretreated with 50 μm PD98059, 50 μm U0126, or Me2SO for 15 min and stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF or vehicle for 1 h in the continued presence or absence of either MEK inhibitor. To quantitate c-Raf activity, immunoprecipitated, endogenous c-Raf was tested for its ability to phosphorylate kinase-defective MEK in vitro (Fig. 4). PD98059 had no effect on basal c-Raf activity in unstimulated cells; U0126 marginally increased basal c-Raf activity (Fig. 4 A). However, PD98059 or U0126 treatment enhanced EGF-stimulated c-Raf activity approximately 2–3- or 5–6-fold, respectively, r"

WASP contains many functional domains and has been shown to induce the formation of clusters of actin filaments in a manner dependent on Cdc42. However, there has been no report investigating what domain(s) is(are) important for the function. Here we present for the first time the results of detailed analyses on the domain-function relationship of WASP. First, the C-terminal verprolin-cofilin-acidic domain was shown to be essential for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we found that the clustering of WASP itself is distinct from actin clustering. The partial protein containing the region from the N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain to the basic residue-rich region also clustered especially around the nucleus as wild type WASP without inducing actin clustering. Finally, we obtained the quite unexpected result that a WASP mutant deficient in binding to Cdc42 still induced actin cluster formation, indicating that direct interaction between Cdc42 and WASP is not required for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. This result may explain why no Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients have been identified with a missense mutation in the Cdc42-binding site.

WASP is composed of 502 amino acid residues and contains many functional domains such as the pleckstrin homology (PH)1 domain, GTPase binding domain (GBD)/Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, proline-rich (PR) domain, verprolin homology (VPH) domain, cofilin homology domain, and C-terminal highly acidic region.

The binding to Cdc42 is thought to be of particular importance (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Cdc42 is a Rho family small GTPase that is known to play a critical role in the formation of actin microspikes in response to external stimuli (12Nobes C.D. Hall A.

Indeed, it was shown that activated Cdc42 specifically and directly bound to the GBD/CRIB motif of WASP. They also demonstrated that ectopic expression of WASP induces the formation of actin filament (F-actin) clusters that overlap with the expressed WASP itself. Another WASP family protein, N-WASP, also has the PH domain, GBD/CRIB motif, PR domain, VPH domain, and C-terminal acidic region (17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). This protein has been shown to play important roles in Cdc42-dependent filopodium formation (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), although in structure it is very similar to WASP. Both of these proteins cause actin polymerization, but with different features when they are expressed in cells; WASP mainly localizes at perinuclear areas and causes actin clustering (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), but most N-WASP is present at plasma membranes and induces filopodium formation (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In the case of N-WASP, direct binding of activated Cdc42 seems to unmask the folded inactive N-WASP (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). With regard to N-WASP, the mechanism by which it induces filopodium has been well studied. However, it still remains unknown how WASP is regulated by Cdc42 and how WASP induces actin clustering. We here report the results of expression analyses of various WASP mutants. We identified the regions that are responsible for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and the intracellular localization of WASP itself. The most unexpected and interesting result is that the direct binding between WASP and Cdc42 has no physiological function in the actin cluster formation induced by WASP, at least in these expression systems. Polyclonal anti-WASP antibody was prepared in rabbits immunized with bacterially expressed recombinant protein (amino acids 149–310). Antiserum was purified with protein A gel (Pierce). The monoclonal antibody specific for the c-Myc epitope tag was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The secondary antibodies linked to alkaline phosphatase (used in Western blotting) and fluorescein (used in immunofluorescence microscopy) were from Promega and Capel, respectively. The polyclonal antibody specific for the Arp3 was prepared in rabbits according to the method of Welch et al. (18Welch M.D. Iwamatsu A. Mitchison T.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Construction of mutants of ΔPHWI (deletion of amino acids 1–193), ΔWI (deletion of amino acids 155–193), ΔPRVCA (deletion of amino acids 311–502), and ΔPR (deletion of amino acids 311–413) was done by using the polymerase chain reaction. ΔPH (107–502) was obtained by Acc I digestion and excision of the cDNA fragment coding for amino acids 1–106. PHWI (amino acids 1–222) and PHBR (amino acids 1–240) were obtained as cDNA truncated at the Pvu II site and Apa LI site, respectively. H246DΔSH was prepared as follows. The polymerase chain reaction fragment (1–247; H246D) obtained with mutagenized primer was ligated to the PmaC I site of the wild type cDNA fragment coding for amino acids 250–502. WASP full-length (WT and H246DΔSH), CRIB (131–309; WT and H246DΔSH) and VCA (414–502) were obtained as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins or Histidine (His)-tagged proteins. GST-full length, -CRIB, and -VCA were constructed by inserting the cDNA fragments into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The His-CRIB construction was obtained by subcloning the cDNA fragments into pQE 30 (Qiagen). Cdc42 and profilin I were also obtained as GST fusion proteins (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 15Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). GST fusion and His-tagged proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 16Miki H. Miura K. Matuoka K. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Orita S. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5489-5492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). WASP (WT and mutants) and Cdc42 (G12V and T17N) were subcloned into pEF-BOS mammalian expression vectors (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were transfected with these plasmids by electroporation and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). About 70% of transfected cells indicated each phenotype. WASP (WT, H246DΔSH, or ΔPR)-expressing COS7 cell lysates were prepared as follows. Cells were harvested with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was collected as cell lysates. 150 μg of GST-Cdc42 was immobilized on 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-Cdc42 beads were incubated in 50 μl of GTPγS or GDP-binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm GTPγS or GDP) at 30 °C for 10 min, and then MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The GTPγS or GDP-loaded GST-Cdc42 beads were suspended and incubated in WASP-expressing COS7 lysates (WT or H246DΔSH) with 5 mm MgCl2 at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. In the case of profilin I, 150 μg of GST-profilin I was immobilized on 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The GST-profilin I beads were suspended and incubated in WASP-expressing COS7 lysates (WT or ΔPR) at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. After being washed with lysis buffer (without Triton X-100 and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), the beads were suspended in SDS sample buffer, and Western blotting was performed. GST and GST-CRIB (WT or H246DΔSH) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by blotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking and washing with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100), the membranes were incubated with probes for 5 min and washed with binding buffer. The signal was visualized by autoradiography. The probes were prepared as follows. Cdc42 cleaved from GST fusion protein by thrombin digestion was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA. Then the GTP-binding reaction was performed. 300 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 6 μg of Cdc42, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP) was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and then 8μl, 40, and 200 μl of this Cdc42 added to 492, 460, and 300 μl of binding buffer and MgCl2 (final 10 mm), respectively. 30 μg of GST-VCA was immobilized on 15 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were incubated with various concentrations of His-CRIB protein (WT or H246DΔSH) in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Then they were washed, and Western blotting was performed. 10 μg of GST-full length (WT or H246DΔSH) or -VCA was immobilized on 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The beads were incubated with 0.2 or 1 μmArp2/3 complex in the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mm KCl) at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Then they were washed, and Western blotting was performed. The Arp2/3 complex was purified from bovine brain by the method described previously (19Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We first tried to determine which region of WASP is essential for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. As described above, WASP is composed of many functional domains. In the case of N-WASP, another WASP family protein, both the VCA domain and the PR domain have been shown to be important for the formation of actin microspikes (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 15Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 20Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The VCA domain and the PR domain of N-WASP directly bind to actin and profilin, respectively (15Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In reference to these results, to examine which domain of WASP is important for the actin clustering, we prepared two deletion constructs ΔPRVCA (lacking both the PR and VCA domains) and ΔPR (lacking only the PR domain) schematically shown in Fig.1 A, and transfected COS7 cells with them. We checked the expression of each protein by Western blotting and confirmed that the two proteins are expressed at similar levels (Fig. 1 B). We next immunostained the cells with anti-WASP antibody and phalloidin to visualize the expressed WASP (including mutants) and actin filaments (F-actin), respectively. As a result, ΔPR was found to induce actin clustering as well as did the wild type (WT), whereas ΔPRVCA did not (Fig.2 A), suggesting that the VCA domain is essential for the formation of actin clustering. This conclusion is consistent with a previous report in which the deletion of the VCA domain was shown to abolish the actin clustering activity (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar)Figure 2Verprolin-cofilin-acidic domain is essential for the actin clustering induced by WASP. A, immunofluorescence staining of cells untransfected and transfected with WT, ΔPRVCA, and ΔPR WASP. COS7 cells were transfected with WASP constructs (WT, ΔPRVCA, or ΔPR). WASP and F-actin were visualized with anti-WASP antibody and phalloidin, respectively. B, profilin-WASP binding assay. WASP (WT or ΔPR)-expressing COS7 cell lysates were incubated with GST or GST-profilin I-immobilized glutathione beads. The bound proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with anti-WASP antibody. GST or GST-profilin was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results presented above also suggest that direct binding to profilin is not required for the actin clustering, because the PR domain in N-WASP is the site for direct binding to profilin. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the possible interaction between WASP and profilin. WASP (WT or ΔPR)-expressing COS7 cell lysate was incubated with GST or GST-profilin I immobilized on beads, and then the bound protein was examined by Western blotting with anti-WASP antibody. Fig.2 B shows that ΔPR failed to bind to profilin, whereas WT did bind. Taken together, these results indicate that WASP induces actin clustering in a manner independent of direct binding with profilin via the PR domain. It was shown that ΔPRVCA composed only of the N-terminal 310 residues of WASP clusters especially around the nucleus like the wild type WASP (Fig. 2 A). This indicates that the unidentified signal that determines the intracellular localization of WASP exists within the 310 residues. The N terminus of WASP contains many functional domains such as the PH domain, WASP insert (WI) domain, which is WASP-unique proline-rich domain compared with N-WASP, basic-rich region (BR), and GBD/CRIB motif (Fig. 1 A). To determine which domains are important for the clustering of WASP, we transfected COS7 cells with various N-terminal deletion constructs such as ΔPHWI, ΔWI, and ΔPH (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig.3 A, ΔWI was shown to cluster around the nuclei with F-actin as well as did the WT, indicating that the WI domain is not required for the clustering. In contrast, ΔPHWI and ΔPH did not cluster around the nuclei but instead induced marked retraction of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 A). Most of the expressed ΔPHWI and ΔPH proteins seemed to accumulate at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the PH domain is important for WASP clustering. We next examined whether the PH domain is sufficient for the clustering by expressing other N terminus-modified constructs such as PH, PHWI, and PHBR (Fig. 1 A). Although PH (data not shown) and PHWI were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, PHBR clustered around the nuclei as did wild type WASP (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the region from the PH domain to the basic-rich region is essential for WASP clustering. A previous study by Symons et al. (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar) showed that the expression of dominant-negative Cdc42 suppresses WASP-induced actin clustering. Indeed, we also confirmed that this inhibition occurs in COS7 cells (described later). To examine whether direct binding is required for actin cluster formation, we prepared a GBD/CRIB motif-modified construct (H246DΔSH; Fig. 1 A). We first checked whether this mutation really abolishes binding to Cdc42. First, we investigated the binding by using GST-Cdc42-immobilized beads. WASP (WT or H246DΔSH)-expressing COS7 cell lysates were incubated with GST or GST-Cdc42 (pre-loaded with GDP or GTPγS) immobilized on beads. Then Western blotting with anti-WASP antibody was performed. H246DΔSH failed to bind to GTPγS-loaded GST-Cdc42, whereas WT did bind (Fig.4 A). Second, we performed immunoprecipitation. WASP (WT or H246DΔSH) and c-Myc-tagged Cdc42G12V were co-expressed in COS7 cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-c-Myc antibody. Fig. 4 B shows that Cdc42 did not co-precipitate with H246DΔSH at all. Third, we examined the direct association between GBD/CRIB motif in WASP and Cdc42. GST and GST-CRIB (WT and H246DΔSH) blotted on membranes were incubated with Cdc42 (loaded with 32P-labeled GTP), and a positive signal was detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig.4 C, Cdc42 bound to only wild type GST-CRIB. The results of these three experiments clearly indicate that H246DΔSH does not bind to Cdc42. We next examined the effect of H246DΔSH expression by immunofluorescence microscopy. Unexpectedly, this Cdc42-binding defective mutant also induced actin clusters like wild type WASP (Fig.5 A). In the case of N-WASP, the actin-regulating VCA domain is thought to be masked at the resting state by the intra- and/or intermolecular interaction with the region containing the GBD/CRIB motif (14Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Another effector of Cdc42, p21-activated kinase is also thought to be kept inactive at the resting state, and its GBD/CRIB motif-modified mutant that does not bind to Cdc42 becomes constitutively active (21Sells M.A. Knaus U.G Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 22Bokoch G.M. Reilly A.M. Daniels R.H. King C.C. Olivera A. Spiegel S. Knaus U.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 8137-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because there is a possibility that the GBD/CRIB motif-modified mutant, H246DΔSH, is also constitutively active, we checked for interaction between WASP (WT and H246DΔSH) and its downstream effector, the Arp2/3 complex (23Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we first prepared anti-Arp3 antibody (Fig.5 B). Using this antibody, it was found that full-length WASP (WT and H246DΔSH) weakly binds to the Arp2/3 complex compared with the VCA protein and that there is no significant difference in binding to the Arp2/3 complex between the WT and H246DΔSH full-length WASPs (Fig. 5 C). This result strongly supports the idea that the H246DΔSH mutant still keeps the normal protein conformation. In support of this possibility, the GBD/CRIB motif-containing region of H246DΔSH associated with the VCA domain-containing region with the same affinity as the WT GBD/CRIB motif-containing region (Fig.5 D). Taken together, the results suggest that direct binding with Cdc42 is dispensable for actin cluster formation. Further, to examine whether H246DΔSH-induced actin cluster formation is affected by dominant-negative Cdc42, we co-transfected COS7 cells with H246DΔSH and Cdc42T17N. As shown in Fig.6, the co-expression of dominant-negative Cdc42 also suppressed the formation of actin clusters induced by H246DΔSH. Thus, we conclude that WASP has some functional interaction with Cdc42, but direct physical interaction between them is not required for actin cluster formation.Figure 6Cdc42T17N inhibits actin cluster formation induced by GBD/CRIB motif-mutated WASP, H246DΔSH. COS7 cells were transfected with both H246DΔSH and Cdc42T17N (c-Myc-tagged). The cells were stained with anti-WASP antibody, anti-c-Myc antibody, and phalloidin to visualize WASP, Cdc42, and F-actin, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been suggested that WASP plays a key role in regulating cytoskeletal reorganization. However, little is known about the mechanism by which it does so. WASP has many functional domains through which it interacts with various signaling and/or cytoskeletal proteins. Ectopic expression of WASP has been shown to induce the clustering of the expressed WASP itself (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). In addition, actin filaments are also accumulated at the clusters of WASP. Although the physiological relevance of this WASP/actin cluster is unknown, the existence of similar vesicle-like structures is reported in phorbol ester-treated MEG-01 magakaryoblastic cell line (11Miki H. Nonoyama S. Zhu Q. Aruffo A. Ochs H.D. Takenawa T. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of the clusters in vivo. It has been reported that Cdc42 regulates the formation of these WASP/actin clusters (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), because activated Cdc42 directly binds to the GBD/CRIB motif of WASP and the expression of its dominant-negative mutant completely inhibits the cluster formation (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). Thus, we started to investigate which domains are required for the actin clustering and the accumulation of WASP itself and the role of Cdc42 in the process. First, the VCA domain was shown to be essential for the accumulation of actin filaments. This result is consistent with a previous study in which the deletion of the C-terminal 59 amino acid residues resulted in the inability to induce the actin clustering (3Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. Mccormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). The VCA domain consists of a verprolin homology (VPH) domain, a cofilin homology domain, and a highly acidic region. We reported that direct interaction between the VPH domain and actin is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization in the case of N-WASP, suggesting that the VPH domain of WASP might also be required for actin clustering (20Miki H. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that the Arp2/3 complex, which plays an important role in nucleating actin filaments, binds to the C terminus of WASP (23Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). The binding region was narrowed down to the C-terminal 38 residues in the case of WAVE/Scar1, a WASP/N-WASP-related protein that also possess a similar VCA domain. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the region plays a critical role in Rac-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (23Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 24Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Arp2/3 binding region is corresponds to the cofilin homology domain and the acidic region. The deletion of eight residues in the cofilin homology domain (amino acids 473–480), as expected, resulted in the inhibition of the accumulation of actin filaments (data not shown). Thus, both the actin binding to the VPH domain and the Arp2/3-binding to the region from cofilin homology domain to the acidic region are important in actin clustering. This may trigger the actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex and induce the subsequent actin polymerization on newly formed actin filaments. The region important for the clustering of WASP itself was narrowed down to one covering from the N-terminal PH domain to the basic residue-rich region. The PH domain seemed to be essential, because the deletion mutants of the PH domain showed a different intracellular localization from the wild type WASP. It has been reported that the PH domain may be responsible for cellular localization via interactions with specific lipids and/or proteins (25Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W.

A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of phospholipase Cδ1, the PH domain specifically interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and localizes to plasma membrane (28Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PH domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase specifically recognizes the βγ subunit of the G-protein and, through the interaction with Gβγ, inactivates G-protein-coupled receptor (29Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

A. 1994; 91: 3637-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite probable and reasonable that the PH domain of WASP also recognizes some specific lipids and/or proteins and locates WASP to the special structures seen in the photographs shown in the figures. Lastly, we found that WASP does not need to associate directly with Cdc42 to induce the actin cluster formation. The GBD/CRIB motif-containing region was shown to bind to the actin-regulating VCA domain (Fig. 5 D), suggesting that WASP also takes some folded inactive structure as N-WASP. Thus, some other proteins and/or specific lipids play a role as an activator of WASP in cells. However, the results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that Cdc42 affects the actin cluster formation induced by WASP, even in the case of Cdc42-binding defective WASP mutant. Some other factors link Cdc42 and WASP, signal transduction pathways of WASP and Cdc42 are both required for actin cluster formation, or Cdc42 functions downstream of WASP. Although we cannot answer here which possibility is true, this is a new concept and gives us a novel insight into the regulation and/or function of WASP.

Since the T4 complex is probably the simplest replication system that includes separate processivity clamp and clamp loader and primosome subassemblies, the T4 system has often served as a useful paradigm to elucidate and model some of the mechanistically important interactions that also occur within the replication complexes of higher organisms. The central replication machinery of bacteriophage T4 consists of seven phage-encoded proteins that work together with the DNA of the replication fork to form the minimal complex that permits efficient leading and lagging DNA synthesis and replication fork movement (1Nossal N.G. Karam J.D. Bacteriophage T4. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar). These protein components are organized into three functional subassemblies within the replication complex. These are (i) the DNA-dependent DNA replication polymerase of T4 (gp43), which contains both synthesis and exonuclease (3′ → 5′) editing domains and works together with the T4-coded single-stranded DNA binding protein (gp32) to catalyze DNA synthesis on both strands of the replication fork; (ii) the T4-coded polymerase accessory proteins (gp44/62 and gp45), which form the processivity clamp (gp45) and ATP-dependent clamp-loading (gp44/62) machinery of the T4 system; and (iii) the T4 coded helicase (gp41) and primase (gp61) components, which interact to form a primosome subassembly that contains an ATP-dependent helicase (gp41) that “opens” the template DNA ahead of the replication fork and a primase (gp61) that catalyzes the template-directed polymerization of the RNA primers that initiate the synthesis of Okazaki fragments by gp43 in lagging strand DNA synthesis. These three subassemblies are “coupled” within the replication fork to form a replisome capable of coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strand DNA. This seven-protein replication system is organized and held together by specific protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that allow the various components to communicate with one another within the replisome, and most of them move with the replication fork to achieve complete synthesis of the T4 genome without dissociation. This multiprotein DNA replication machine can self-assemble in vitro and elongates DNA at the replication fork at rates and with fidelities that are comparable with those measured in vivo (2Hibner U. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1980; 285: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 3Sinha N.K. Morris C.F. Alberts B.M. J. Biol.

A complete molecular understanding of the T4 replication complex and its subassemblies requires the definition and “mapping” of the various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that stabilize and modulate the complex during function. Physical biochemical studies have established the overall binding stoichiometries and interaction affinities of the protein components of the polymerase accessory proteins (holoenzyme) complex (4Jarvis T.C.

In addition, details of the interactions between the components of the sliding processivity clamp and clamp loading proteins are being elucidated by a combination of cross-linking reactions and fluorescent probe techniques (8Latham G.J.

In this report, we use proteolytic digestion and kinase protection assays to begin to map the protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions that occur within the primosome subassembly of the T4 DNA replication complex. The T4 primosome consists of a hexagonal helicase of identical gp41 subunits, which forms a stable complex with a single primase (gp61) subunit in the presence of hydrolyzable or nonhydrolyzable purine ribonucleoside triphosphates. The ring-shaped gp41 hexamer (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) carries a cryptic ATPase (or GTPase) that is activated by the binding of gp41 helicase to single-stranded DNA. This ATPase is coupled to a directional (5′ → 3′) double-stranded DNA unwinding (helicase) activity, which is further stimulated by binding of the gp61 primase (12Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2821-2829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

The primase itself serves as a limited polymerase in that, in the presence of single-stranded DNA, it can catalyze a limited template-dependent polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates, yielding mainly dimers at high primase concentrations (15Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of the gp41 helicase stimulates this RNA synthesis activity of the gp61 primase and switches the reaction primarily to the template-directed formation of specific pentameric primers (15Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10873-10878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn serve to prime the synthesis of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand synthesis in vitro (12Liu C.C.

J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 135: 841-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A functional association of primase and helicase also operates within the DNA replication systems of bacteriophage T7 (19Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9818-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (20LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4738-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lee M.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14531-14542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In T7, the helicase and primase domains are fused within the same polypeptide chain, while in E. coli and T4 these functions are in separate subunits. Although many studies have demonstrated that manifestation of the full physiological activity of both the helicase and the primase components of these systems depend on the combined presence of both proteins, the details of the direct physical interactions between them have not been mapped in any system. In this paper, we report the construction of gp61 primase variants that carry a kinase tag at either the N terminus or the C terminus of the gp61 polypeptide chain. The interactions of these tagged gp61 variants within the primosome have been defined using proteolytic digestion and kinase protection footprinting techniques. By employing these methods in combination to probe the interactions that occur between the primase and helicase, in both the presence and the absence of single-stranded DNA, we have been able to identify a number of macromolecular interaction sites and conformational changes within the primosome. These studies comprise the beginnings of a detailed interaction map of subunit contacts and interaction sites within the T4 DNA replication complex. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Vent DNA polymerase for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 and DNA restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Unlabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides was obtained from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Endoproteinases, bovine heart muscle protein kinase (HMPK), and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Three gp61 derivatives were constructed for these studies and are shown schematically in Fig.1. The first construct (designated H-gp61) carries a hexa-His tag at the N terminus, while the second (H-gp61-K) carries a hexa-His tag at the N terminus and a bovine HMPK tag (sequence RRASV) at the C terminus. The third construct (HTK-gp61) contains a hexa-His-tag, followed by a thrombin cleavage site (sequence LVPRGSRRASV) to permit removal of the His tag if necessary and a HMPK tag at the N terminus. The procedures used to construct these plasmid vectors are outlined in Fig. 2, A and B. The coding sequence for the full-length gp61 primase was PCR oligonucleotide-amplified using pDH911 (22Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12858-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as the template strand. The purified PCR products of pHis-g61 and pHis-g61-K were inserted into pQE30 vector (Qiagen) at Bam HI and Sma I sites, and the resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The pQE30 vector (Qiagen) encodes an N-terminal hexa-His-tag, and transcript synthesis was initiated at a phage T5 promoter. The pQE30-HTK-gp61 construct was made using pQE30-H-gp61 as a template for a one-step PCR to insert both the thrombin site and the HMPK tag downstream of the His tag at the N terminus of the primase DNA. The gel-purified PCR products were self-ligated. The gp61 plasmids were transformed into the E. coli SG13009[pREP4] host strain carrying the pREP4 repressor plasmid and were expressed and purified using the QIAexpression system (Qiagen). The SG13009[pREP4] strain carrying the gp61 derivatives was grown overnight in LB-medium at 30 °C. The resulting culture was then diluted 100-fold and grown to the midlog stage at 30 °C. Protein overexpression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm and shifting the temperature to 37 °C for 2–3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until used. The His-tagged gp61 proteins were purified using a nondenaturing batch mode metal ion affinity chromatography procedure on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), followed by passage through a DE52 column. The T4 helicase (gp41) protein was overexpressed in E. coli strain OR1264/pDH518 (22Hinton D.M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12858-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This procedure yielded a clean preparation that migrates as a single Coomassie Blue G-250-stained band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentrations of purified gp41 and gp61 samples were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient (εM,280) of 7.6 × 104m−1cm−1 for gp41 and 6.9 × 104m−1 cm−1 for gp61. These extinction coefficients were calculated from amino acid residue composition data as described elsewhere (23Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5072) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the ATPase activity of gp41 (23Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was used as the primary assay to test the functional integrity of the various gp61 constructs. Reactions were run in 1× TAMK buffer (33 mm Tris-OAc, 50 mm K-OAc, 6 mmMg(OAc)2, pH 7.8) at a final 50 nmconcentration of wild type gp61 or gp61 variants. The reactions also contained 1 μm concentrations of single-stranded dT50 oligomers (hereafter designed ssDNA), 300 nm gp41 (monomer concentration units), 3.5 mmdATP, and 3.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. All components (except gp41) were premixed, and the ATPase assay was started by adding gp41 (in a 6:1 monomer ratio to gp61) to the other components at zero time. Two-μl aliquots were taken after 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 5, and 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose paper, and subjected to thin layer chromatography. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured by tracking both the disappearance of ATP and the formation of pyrophosphate (PPi) as a function of time, using the AMBIS (San Diego) radioactivity scanning and analysis systems. The ability of the various gp61 derivatives to participate in primosome formation reactions was tested using a gel shift assay as described previously (7Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19625-19631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 nmconcentrations of single-stranded M13mp18 DNA and 0.5 μmconcentrations of gp61 (wild-type or variants, either phosphorylated or not phosphorylated at kinase sites) in 1× TAMK buffer were mixed with 1 mm ATP and 3 μm concentrations of gp41 (monomer units) in a 20-μl reaction volume. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1–2 min before loading onto an 0.5% native agarose gel, and the gel was subjected to electrophoresis at 40 V in a minigel apparatus with a running buffer of 0.5× TAMK buffer (33 mm Tris-OAc, 50 mm K-OAc, 0.1 mmMg(OAc)2, pH 7.8). The free DNA and DNA-protein gel bands were visualized by SYBR Green I staining (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). Kinase labeling was performed as described (25Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The isolated H-gp61-K derivative was subjected to kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation for 30 min at room temperature in a 100-μl reaction containing 5 μm concentrations of H-gp61-K, 5 μl of 3000 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), and about 5 units of reconstituted bovine HMPK. Reactions were stopped by quenching on ice for 30 min. The H-gp61-K protein was freshly labeled by kinase-dependent phosphorylation prior to each protein digestion footprinting experiment. Seventy μl of 500 nm C-terminal or N-terminal HMPK-tagged gp61 derivatives were preincubated for 5 min at 25 °C with 10 μm of dT50 (concentration in nucleotides) in either the absence or the presence of 3 μm gp41 (monomer units). All reactions contained 0.5 mm of GTPγS to drive gp41 hexamer formation to completion and were run in TAMK buffer. The efficiency of the kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the HMPK tag in 1× TAMK buffer was almost the same as in the protein kinase buffer recommended by Sigma. (We used TAMK buffer in these studies to ensure proper primosome assembly, since the earlier studies of this function had been conducted in this buffer (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).) The total protein concentration in each kinase reaction was brought to 30 μg by adding purified bovine serum albumin (BSA) from New England Biolabs. At these protein and DNA concentrations, primosome formation goes to completion on a single-stranded DNA template (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Kinase tag phosphorylation reactions were initiated by adding 10 units of reconstituted catalytic subunit of HMPK (Sigma P-2645) with 0.1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Ten-μl aliquots were removed at various times and quenched with 10 mm ATP and 50 mm EDTA to a final volume of 40 μl. The time course of kinase-catalyzed incorporation of phosphate groups onto the serine residue of the HMPK tag of gp61 derivatives under various conditions was assayed by separating the protein components on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and quantitating the 32P-labeled bands with a model 860 Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Tryptic digestion footprinting of native gp61 derivatives was performed using 25 ng of trypsin in TAMK buffer at 37 °C in 100-μl reaction volumes containing 0.5 μm C-terminal [32P]ATP-labeled H-gp61-K ([32P]gp61CK). For studies in the presence of single-stranded DNA and/or gp41, 5 μm concentrations of dT50 and/or 0.5 μm concentrations of gp41 hexamer (formed in the presence of 0.5 mm GTPγS) were added. The total concentration of protein in each sample was adjusted to 210 μg/ml by adding BSA. Twenty-μl aliquots were taken after 0.2, 0.5, 1, or 5 min of incubation, and proteolysis was terminated by adding 5 μl of H2O and 5 μl of 5× protein loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, 20% β-mercaptoethnol, 8% SDS, and 50% glycerol) and immediately cooling the samples to −70 °C by plunging into dry ice. The resulting tryptic cleavage products were incubated at 80 °C for 5 min before loading onto a Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resulting gel patterns were quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Internal molecular weight markers were prepared by partial proteolytic digestion of [32P]gp61CK and were run in parallel with the footprinting reactions. These partial digests were prepared by mixing 0.5 μm of [32P]gp61CK in 100 μl of 1× TAMK buffer containing 0.1% SDS and either 20 ng of endoproteinase Lys-C or 10 ng of endoproteinase Asp-N. (These proteases cleave at lysine and aspartic acid residues, respectively.) Thirty-μl aliquots were removed after 1, 5, and 10 min of incubation at 37 °C. Partial tryptic digestion was also used to obtain molecular weight marker ladders. For this purpose, cleavage was performed using 0.5 μmconcentrations of [32P]gp61CK in a 70-μl volume of TAMK solution containing 0.1% SDS and 20 ng of trypsin. Thirty-five-μl aliquots were removed after 30 s or 1 min of incubation. All samples were quenched by adding 6 μl of protein loading buffer to each tube and incubating at 80 °C for 5 min before loaded onto a Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A plot of the logarithm of the molecular weights of these gp61 peptides as a function of distance migrated in a gel electrophoresis experiment was almost linear (see Fig. 8 B) and was used as a standard curve to establish the sizes of the gp61 fragments obtained in the tryptic footprinting studies. The time courses of digestion of H-gp61-K with Asp-N endoproteinase were obtained by mixing 0.5 μm H-gp61-K with Asp-N at a molar ratio of 100:1, in either the absence or presence of 0.1% SDS, in a 100-μl reaction volume. Twenty-μl aliquots were removed after 0, 5, 15, and 30 min and 5 h of incubation at 37 °C and quenched by the addition of 4 μl of protein loading buffer. The proteolytically cleaved fragments were separated on 10% SDS-acrylamide gels and displayed by autoradiography. Cleavage products were analyzed using discontinuous Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (26Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). This gel system can resolve cleavage products differing length by 5 residues or less in the molecular weight range used here. Electrophoresis was performed on three-layer cross-linked 20 × 22-cm slab gels that were 0.75 mm in thickness. The separating gel (16.5% T, 6% C with 6 murea) was overlaid by a 2–3-cm spacing gel (10% T, 3% C) and a 2–3-cm stacking gel (4% T, 3% C). Samples were initially run through the stacking gel at 90 V for 1–2 h and then electrophoresed at 180 V for 15–20 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and quantitated using the ImageQuant software provided by Molecular Dynamics. These data were analyzed essentially as described by Heyduk and co-workers (27Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PhosphorImager intensities of all lanes were integrated across the full widths of the lanes and plotted versus electrophoretic mobility using the ImageQuant program. Gel loading was normalized to constant efficiency across the entire lane, including the portions corresponding to uncleaved full-length protein. The resulting plots of intensity as a function of lane position were aligned to correct for lane-to-lane gel distortion using the ALIGN program (27Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Severinov K. Tang H. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10162-10166Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Data from multiple lanes were averaged. Difference plots of cleavage patterns for averaged data for each complex (ssDNA-gp61, gp41-gp61, and ssDNA-gp61-gp41) were compared with difference plots obtained using averaged data obtained with [32P]gp61CK alone by calculating the value of (IC − Igp61)/Itotal for each data set, where IC represents the corrected intensity data for each complex as described above, Igp61 represents the corrected intensity data measured with gp61 alone, and Itotal is the total intensity calculated for each pattern. Final difference plots were constructed by plotting averaged values of ((IC −Igp61)/Itotal) for each complex versus residue number. Residue numbers were obtained for gp61 from the electrophoretic mobility data, using polynomial curve fitting with KaleidaGraph. Fig.1 shows the gp61 variants (and their designations) that we constructed for this study. Successful protein footprinting measurements require the use of protein probes that have been labeled to high specific radioactivity at defined sites. These modified protein probes must also be fully functional. After checking for activity (see below), we monitored the rates of phosphorylation of specific “kinase tag sequences” by cAMP-dependent BHMP kinase, as well as by proteolytic cleavage reactions, to examine intermolecular interactions of the primase within the primosome. For this purpose, a five-amino acid residue kinase (HMPK) recognition motif (tag) was introduced at the N or the C terminus of the gp61 sequence by PCR methods, as described in Fig.2. The use of the H-gp61-K construct ensures that only full-length gp61 polypeptide chains are labeled. A thrombin cleavage site was built into the HTK-gp61 construct to permit removal of the His tag after protein purification if necessary. However, we found that treatment with the thrombin endopeptidase also resulted in some chain cleavage within the gp61 sequence, and since the His-tag was shown to have no effect on the gp41-ATPase stimulation activity of the primase (see Fig. 4 A), the His tag was not removed in these studies. As shown in Fig. 3, the N- and the C-terminal kinase-tagged gp61 derivatives were phosphorylated by kinase at approximately equal rates, which also corresponds closely to the rate of phosphorylation of the C-terminal kinase-tagged β-subunit of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme of E. coli under the same conditions (28Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As a control, a gp61 derivative carrying a His tag at the N terminus, but no HMPK tag, was subjected to the same kinase treatment. No significant phosphorylation was observed (see Fig. 3). These results with the T4 primase, taken together with those on the β-subunit of E. coli, suggest that the kinase recognition sites at both termini of gp61 are very accessible to phosphorylation by kinase and may be fully exposed on the protein surface. We note that the kinase reaction rates for both free gp61 derivatives are linear in time of incubation well beyond 10 min, validating our use of the extent of phosphorylation at 8 min (see below) as a measure of relative kinase-dependent phosphorylation rates for the various binary and ternary complexes studied with the kinase protection assay. The labeled gp61 derivatives used in this study represent significant modifications of wild type gp61, not only because several amino acid residues have been added to the termini of the polypeptide chains but also because phosphorylation of the kinase tag inserts a charged phosphate group. Thus, the activities of the labeled gp61 derivatives must be compared with those of wild-type gp61 to ensure that these modifications do not alter essential primase functions. To this end, we measured both the magnitude of the gp61-dependent stimulation of gp41 ATPase activity and the ability of gp61 derivatives to form primosomes as partial assays for the functional activities of our gp61 constructs (see “Materials and Methods”). The T4 helicase (gp41) carries a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase/GTPase activity that is significantly stimulated by the addition of stoichiometric concentrations (one primase subunit per six helicase subunits) of gp61 (7Dong F. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19625-19631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12426-12434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows a plot of the rate of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by fixed concentrations of gp41 and ssDNA cofactor in the presence and absence of stoichiometric quantities (one primase subunit to six helicase subunits) of the various gp61 derivatives. As this figure shows, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by gp41 was stimulated more than 2-fold by the gp61 addition, and the modified gp61 derivatives were just as effective as the wild-type primase in producing this stimulation. We also demonstrated that gp61 derivatives phosphorylated by kinase action stimulate the gp41 ATPase to the same extent as the unphosphorylated derivatives (data not shown). A gel retardation assay was used to test the ability of the various gp61 derivatives to participate in primosome assembly with gp41 hexamers and M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (7Dong F. von Hippel P.H.

To examine the binding of IGF-II to a marsupial CI-MPR in a homologous system, we have previously purified kangaroo IGF-II (Yandell, C. A., Francis, G. L., Wheldrake, J. F., and Upton, Z. (1998) J.

Furthermore, real-time biomolecular interaction analysis revealed that the kangaroo CI-MPR has a higher affinity for kangaroo IGF-II than for human IGF-II. The cDNA sequence of the kangaroo CI-MPR indicates that there is considerable divergence in the area corresponding to the IGF-II binding site of the eutherian receptor.

IGF-II is a polypeptide mitogen related to insulin that is believed to be particularly important during placental and embryonic development (3DeChiara T.M. Efstraiadis A. Robertson E.J.

Whereas the role of the CI-MPR in lysosomal enzyme sorting and transport has been largely elucidated (for a review, see Ref. 10Munier-Lehmann H. Mauxion F. Hoflack B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the physiological role of IGF-II binding to this receptor remains unresolved and somewhat controversial. Understanding the functions of the CI-MPR in the IGF system is complicated by the presence of two other receptors, the type 1 IGF and the insulin receptors, which also bind IGF-II. Indeed, many of the effects attributed to IGF-II are mediated via the type 1 IGF receptor (11Hammerman M.R. Gavin III, J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13511-13517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zick Y. Sasaki N. Rees-Jones R.W. Grunberger G. Nissley S.P. Rechler M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, it is widely accepted that the CI-MPR plays an important role in internalizing and degrading extracellular IGF-II (13Oka Y. Rozek L.M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9435-9442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Watanabe H. Sly W.S. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 197-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Polychronakos C.

Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hypothesis that some of the biological actions of IGF-II are mediated by the CI-MPR has been difficult to prove, and much of the evidence has been contradictory. Okamoto et al. (17Okamoto T. Katada T. Murayama Y. Ui M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1990; 62: 709-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Okamoto T. Ohkuni Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12747-12751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the receptor binds to the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein, Gi-2, by means of a specific motif within the receptor's cytoplasmic domain. However, others have not been able to demonstrate interactions between G proteins and the receptor upon stimulation by IGF-II (21Braulke T. Korner C. Rosorius O. Nurnberg B. Baxter R.C. Gluckman P.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 287-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Indeed, many studies have not supported a model in which the CI-MPR acts as a signaling protein (23Braulke T. Tippmer S. Neher E. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Thakker J.K. DiMarchi R. MacDonald K. Caro J.F. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas the CI-MPR has been highly conserved in mammalian species, purification and characterization of the CI-MPR from the chicken and frog revealed that this receptor is unable to bind IGF-II (26Canfield W.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7100-7103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Clairmont K.B. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1177-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, there is no evidence for an IGF-II-specific receptor in any other non-mammalian species examined thus far. This suggests that the CI-MPR acquired an IGF-II binding site after the separation of aves from mammals. Interestingly, the CI-MPR from a marsupial, the American opossum, does contain a binding site for IGF-II, albeit with an apparent 75-fold lower affinity for bovine IGF-II than the bovine receptor (1Dahms N.M. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam B. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the reported lower binding affinity is due to the use of a heterologous assay and possible amino acid differences between opossum and bovine IGF-II, or whether it indeed reflects the true binding affinity of this receptor. This information is important for determining where in evolution the CI-MPR acquired the ability to bind IGF-II. This knowledge, in turn, may lead to a greater understanding of the physiological role of this receptor in IGF-II action. To examine the marsupial CI-MPR in a homologous system, we have previously purified kangaroo IGF-II (2Yandell C.A. Francis G.L. Wheldrake J.F. Upton Z. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and we now report the purification and characterization of the kangaroo CI-MPR. The interaction of the kangaroo CI-MPR with IGF-II has been examined by radioreceptor assay, Western ligand blotting, and real-time biomolecular interaction analysis using both homologous and heterologous ligands. Furthermore, we have cloned the kangaroo CI-MPR cDNA sequence for the region proposed to be the IGF-II binding site on the mammalian receptor and have compared the sequences.

The material from the phosphomannan affinity column was dialyzed against water and then lyophilized. The samples were concentrated to one-tenth of the original volume by resuspending the lyophilized material in 0.25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Purified receptor was concentrated as described above before electrophoresis. Samples and standards were boiled for 15 min in the presence of 2% SDS and applied to 6% or 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

Purified kIGF-II and rhIGF-II were coupled to the dextran-modified gold surface of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling as described in the BIAcore systems manual. Briefly, the dextran surface of the chip was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (40 μl) followed by the addition of a 3 mmIGF-II solution in 0.1 m CH3COONa, pH 4.6 (30 μl). The remaining activated groups were blocked with ethanolamine (40 μl). Surface densities of 390 and 620 resonance units were generated for hIGF-II and kIGF-II, respectively. Before data collection, several methods of surface regeneration after ligand binding were evaluated. It was found that washes with 1m NaCl/0.1 m HCl (30 μl) could remove the bound protein and also preserve the binding capacity of the biosensor surface. Before analysis, receptor preparations were dialyzed against HBS buffer, and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad reagent and human γ-globulin as the standard. Different concentrations (20 μl) of either bovine or kangaroo CI-MPR were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. A non-protein, blocked surface (flow cell 1) served as a blank, and sensorgrams from this flow cell were subtracted from all others. To investigate whether rebinding was apparent during the dissociation phase, HBS buffer containing a 10-fold excess of rhIGF-II (140 μl) was injected during the dissociation phase using the COINJECT command. Membrane and receptor concentrations were determined as outlined above. Human and kangaroo IGF-II concentrations were determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (38Upton Z. Francis G.L. Kita K. Wallace J.C. Ballard F.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using a wavelength of 214 nm and extinction coefficients of 31.701 and 31.69 g liter−1 cm−1, respectively. The cDNA sequences for the putative IGF-II binding region and the G protein recognition site were obtained using mRNA extracted from kangaroo liver, followed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total kangaroo liver RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer and 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase enzyme in a total volume of 20 μl (according to the manufacturer's protocols). Amplification of the putative IGF-II binding region was performed using two non-degenerate oligonucleotide primers that were based on the cDNA sequence of the human CI-MPR. The primer pair 5′-ATCAATGTCTGCAA-3′ (IGF-1) and 5′-CGTCCAGGAGAA-3′ (IGF-2) amplify a 732-base pair fragment spanning repeats 10 and 11. The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 60 mm Tris-SO4 (pH 9.1), 18 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.5 unit of ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR enzyme mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 100 ng of oligonucleotide primers, and 4.5 μl of cDNA template. After denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, the PCR reaction proceeded for 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C (denaturation), 1 min at 50 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (extension). After electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, the correct sized fragment was excised from the agarose gel, purified using Wizard PCR DNA Purification System, and subcloned into the vector (pGEM-7f). Amplification of the putative G protein recognition site was performed using two fully degenerate oligonucleotide primers deduced from the amino acid sequences from the chicken (39Zhou M. Ma Z. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9762-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), human (40Oshima A. Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse (42Szebenyi G. Rotwein P. Genomics. 1994; 19: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) CI-MPRs. This primer pair was based on the amino acid sequences of Gln2385-Glu2386-Asn2387-Glu2388-His2389(GP1) and Phe2474-His2475-Asp2476-Asp2477-Ser2478(GP2) (numbering is based on the human sequence). Amplification using primer set GP1 and GP2 generates a 315-base pair fragment. The PCR was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl containing 60 mmTris-SO4 (pH 9.1), 18 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.5 mmMgSO4, 0.2 mm dNTP, 0.5 unit of ELONGASETM, 200 ng of oligonucleotide primers, and 2.5 μl of cDNA template. After denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, the PCR reaction proceeded for 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C. The PCR product was purified by the Wizard PCR DNA Purification System and subcloned into the vector (pGEM-7f). Cloned PCR products were sequenced in both directions using a radiolabeled terminator cycle sequencing kit, ThermoSequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To verify the sequence, two independent clones were sequenced. Phosphomannan-Sepharose was used to affinity purify the CI-MPR from membrane extracts of kangaroo and bovine livers. The Triton X-100 solubilized liver membranes were passed over the phosphomannan-Sepharose column, and the protein retained after washing with Buffer D was eluted with 4 mm mannose 6-phosphate. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig.1 a). The purified protein migrated as two forms, one with a molecular mass similar to that predicted for the CI-MPR, and a second approximately 50 kDa larger than expected. A faint band at approximately 60 kDa was also observed that most likely represents a small amount of cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor that was able to bind to the column in the absence of Mn2+. Incubation of the purified receptor under reducing conditions before SDS-PAGE inhibited the formation of the slower-migrating, high molecular mass protein, and only one band at approximately 250 kDa, along with the 60-kDa band, was present (data not shown). The purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a polyclonal antibody raised against the rat CI-MPR. Both the higher molecular mass proteins reacted with the anti-rat CI-MPR antibody (Fig. 1 b), whereas the smaller 60-kDa protein did not. The bovine and kangaroo CI-MPRs were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with either 125I-labeled rhIGF-II or125I-labeled kIGF-II (Fig. 2, a and b). Both the kangaroo and bovine receptors specifically bound 125I-labeled IGF-II, and this binding could be displaced by the addition of excess unlabeled rhIGF-II (Fig.2, a and b), but not IGF-I (data not shown). However, the kangaroo CI-MPR bound IGF-II with an apparent lower affinity than the bovine CI-MPR. Moreover, the low affinity of the kangaroo receptor for IGF-II did not appear to be dependent upon whether the heterologous or homologous ligand was used as the probe. On the other hand, when probed with 125I-labeled 4-sulfatase, both the kangaroo and bovine CI-MPRs bound this lysosomal enzyme with equal apparent affinities (Fig. 2 c). Again, this binding was specific because the radioligand was displaced by the addition of 10 mm mannose 6-phosphate. Both species of the receptor (i.e. both bands above 220 kDa) were able to bind IGF-II and 4-sulfatase. Radioreceptor binding assays confirmed the lower binding affinity of the kangaroo CI-MPR for IGF-II. The specific binding of hIGF-II to the kangaroo and bovine CI-MPRs was proportional to the amount of receptor added (Fig.3, a and b). However, greater amounts of kangaroo receptor than bovine receptor were required to achieve a similar level of specific binding. For example, at the highest concentrations tested, 34 and 2460 ng for the bovine and kangaroo CI-MPRs, respectively, specific binding was determined to be 52% and 34% of the radioligand added. Similarly, in an assay measuring the ability of unlabeled rhIGF-II to compete with125I-labeled rhIGF-II for binding to the CI-MPR, specific binding of radiolabeled rhIGF-II to the kangaroo receptor (100 ng/tube) in the absence of competing unlabeled hIGF-II was only 5% of the total counts added (Fig. 4). However, specific binding of the bovine receptor (20 ng/tube) in the absence of added unlabeled rhIGF-II was approximately 80% of the total counts added (Fig. 4), with half-maximal inhibition of radiolabeled rhIGF-II binding to the bovine receptor observed with the addition of 0.6 nmrhIGF-II. Thus, this assay was not useful for analysis of the relative binding affinities of these receptors because of the large discrepancy in the amounts of protein required to obtain a competitive binding curve. Additionally, competitive binding curves were not performed using 125I-labeled kIGF-II because of the low specific activity of this radioligand. Characterization of the interaction between IGF-II and the kangaroo CI-MPR was therefore further investigated by real-time biomolecular interaction analysis.Figure 4Competitive binding curve for the binding of125I-labeled rhIGF-II to the purified bovine (•) and kangaroo (▪) CI-MPR. Increasing amounts of unlabeled rhIGF-II were added to 20 ng of bovine or 100 ng of kangaroo CI-MPR and 10,000 cpm of 125I-labeled rhIGF-II. Nonspecific binding as determined in the absence of receptor was less than 10% of the total counts added and has been subtracted. Specific binding is expressed as a percentage of total counts added, and values represent the mean ± S.D. for one representative experiment performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preliminary experiments examining the binding of kangaroo CI-MPR to IGF-II using real-time biomolecular interaction indicated that the increase in resonance signals when analyzing different concentrations of receptor was dose-dependent (data not shown). However, the dissociation of both the bovine and kangaroo receptors appeared to be very slow. Therefore, we examined the possibility that the receptors were rebinding during the dissociation phase, thus giving a misleading indication of the dissociation rate. Co-injection of excess rhIGF-II immediately after injection of the receptor indicated that significant rebinding was occurring, and all subsequent analysis was performed using a co-injection of excess rhIGF-II. Analysis of the sensorgrams indicated that whereas the association rates of the bovine and kangaroo CI-MPRs are similar, the lower affinity of the kangaroo CI-MPR is due to the fast dissociation of this receptor from IGF-II (Fig.5). Furthermore, the dissociation of the kangaroo CI-MPR appears to be faster when binding to hIGF-II than kIGF-II, whereas the dissociation rate of the bovine CI-MPR is very similar for both IGF-II proteins. A primer pair designed to span the proposed IGF-II binding region was used for the RT-PCR amplification of mRNA isolated from kangaroo liver. A product of approximately 750 base pairs was isolated, cloned, and sequenced (Fig.6 a). The deduced amino acid sequence of the proposed IGF-II binding site, residues 1508–1575, revealed that there is a 60% identity between the kangaroo and bovine CI-MPRs (41Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 49% identity between the kangaroo and chicken receptors (39Zhou M. Ma Z. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9762-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6 b). Of the 27 amino acids that differ between the bovine and kangaroo receptors, 22 are found in the N-terminal region of repeat 11 (1533–1575). The cDNA sequence of the putative G protein recognition site was obtained using RT-PCR, and a PCR product of approximately 500 base pairs was detected. Analysis of the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence and comparison with the sequences reported for bovine (41Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chicken (39Zhou M. Ma Z. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2553-2562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed interesting differences between the species (Fig. 7). Seven of the 14 amino acids comprising the putative G protein binding site differ between the kangaroo and bovine CI-MPRs, whereas 6 of the 14 differ between the kangaroo and chicken sequences. However, 4 of the 14 differ between kangaroo and human CI-MPRs, 3 of the 14 differ between human and bovine CI-MPRs, and 1 of the 14 differs between mouse and human receptors. The CI-MPR from the opossum has previously been shown to bind bovine IGF-II with a 75-fold lower apparent affinity than the bovine receptor (1Dah"

Drosophila A kinase anchor protein 200 (DAKAP200) (753 amino acids) binds regulatory subunits of protein kinase AII (PKAII) isoforms in vitro and in intact cells. The acidic DAKAP200 polypeptide (pI ∼3.8) contains an optimal N-terminal myristoylation site and a positively charged domain that resembles the multifunctional phosphorylation site domain of vertebrate myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate proteins. The 15-kilobase pair DAKAP200 gene contains six exons and encodes a second protein, ΔDAKAP200. ΔDAKAP200 is derived from DAKAP200 transcripts by excision of exon 5 (381 codons), which encodes the PKAII binding region and a Pro-rich sequence. ΔDAKAP200 appears to be a myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate analog. DAKAP200 and ΔDAKAP200 are evident in vivo at all stages of Drosophila development. Thus, both proteins may play important physiological roles throughout the life span of the organism. Nevertheless, DAKAP200 gene expression is regulated. Maximal levels of DAKAP200 are detected in the pupal phase of development; ΔDAKAP200 content is elevated 7-fold in adult head (brain) relative to other body parts.

Current models suggest that AKAPs statically associate with docking sites in organelles. However, it is possible that AKAP·RII complexes shuttle dynamically between intracellular loci. This proposition has neither been excluded nor systematically investigated. Many physiological processes are coordinately regulated by groups of hormones. Homeostatic control is often achieved through synergistic or antagonistic interactions among signaling pathways that are activated by different second messenger molecules. A key question is how signals transmitted via AKAP·PKAII complexes are integrated with inputs from pathways controlled by other second messengers in order to regulate common effector proteins. PKA anchoring may be regulated by pretranslational mechanisms. In thyroid-derived cells, activation of adenylate cyclase elicits AKAP121 gene transcription and accumulation of AKAP121 mRNA and protein (11Feliciello A. Rubin C.S. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23361-23366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, hormonal activation of transcription of other AKAP genes has not been demonstrated. Could the concentration of anchored PKAII be governed by a post-transcriptional mechanism? Drosophila melanogaster provides an attractive model system for addressing questions posed above. Signaling pathways, molecules, and mechanisms used in Drosophila are conserved in mammals (12Miklos G.L. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1996; 86: 521-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Classical and molecular genetics indicate that accumulation and activation of PKA at discrete intracellular locations are essential for normal development and reproduction in Drosophila (13Han J.D.

Consequences of localized activation of PKA are proper anterior-posterior patterning in developing tissues, maintenance of intercellular bridges between nurse cells and oocytes, and remodeling of the microtubule-based cytoskeleton that changes microtubule polarity in embryos and facilitates differential segregation of mRNAs (14Perrimon N.

RII binding assays reveal that Drosophila has about five polypeptides with characteristic features of AKAPs. 3J.-D. Han, Z. Li, and C. S. Rubin, unpublished observations. Thus, systematic characterization of the entire constellation of Drosophila AKAPs is feasible. Such studies could ultimately yield comprehensive knowledge of regulatory properties, integrative functions and precise physiological roles of anchored PKA in the context of individual cells of an intact organism. Recently, we characterized DAKAP550, a large Drosophila anchor protein that is asymmetrically positioned in neurons, gut cells, and trachea (13Han J.D. Baker N.E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26611-26619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further the aim of elucidating the complete spectrum of AKAP structure and function in Drosophila, we now report on the characterization of a novel, multifunctional anchor protein named DAKAP200. Differential splicing of DAKAP200 gene transcripts produces a second polypeptide (ΔDAKAP200) that lacks the ability to bind and target PKAII but appears to subserve functions analogous to those of the mammalian myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein. Expression libraries of Drosophila melanogaster (Canton S strain) cDNAs were searched for inserts encoding A kinase anchor proteins by functional (RII binding) assays and DNA hybridization. cDNA libraries were generated by reverse transcription of mRNAs isolated from embryos 0–24 h after fertilization. Initially, a cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 (CLONTECH) was screened by the procedure of Bregman et al. (21Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP-β-galactosidase fusion proteins in phage plaques are detected by their ability to bind32P-labeled RIIβ. A 5′ Eco RI–Xcm I fragment (386 bp) from the largest cDNA (1.7 kbp) was employed as a template to synthesize a random-primed, 32P-labeled probe for further screening. Two additional libraries were used: a 5′ stretched Drosophila embryo cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 (CLONTECH) and a gridded library in the plasmid pNB40 (22Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol.

The 5′ primer contained an Nde I restriction site followed by nucleotides 1577–1598 of DAKAP200 cDNA; the 3′ primer consisted of the inverse complement of nucleotides 2396–2417 in DAKAP200 cDNA preceded by a Bam HI restriction site. Product DNA was digested with Nde I and Bam HI and cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pET-14b (Novagen) that was cleaved with Nde I and Bam HI. The cDNA insert is preceded by vector DNA that encodes a 20-residue N-terminal peptide. This peptide includes six consecutive His residues, which constitute a Ni2+-binding site. Fusion gene transcription is driven by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), which contains a genomic copy of T7 RNA polymerase under control of the lac operon, was transformed with recombinant pET14b. Transformed bacteria were grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (32Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested, disrupted, and separated into soluble and particulate fractions as described in previous studies (32Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The partial DAKAP200 fusion protein (designated p-DAKAP70) was recovered in the soluble fraction and was purified to near homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography (32Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1935-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 mg of His6 fusion protein was obtained from a 300-ml culture of E. coli. Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites were appended to the 5′- and 3′-ends of cDNA encoding full-length Drosophila RII (RIIDR). After cloning the cDNA into pET14b, His-tagged RIIDRwas expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity by using the strategy described above for the partial DAKAP200 protein. Purified p-DAKAP70 protein (see above) was injected into rabbits (0.35-mg initial injection; 0.2 mg for each of three booster injections) at Covance Laboratories (Vienna, VA) to generate antisera. Serum was collected at 3-week intervals. Purified His-tagged RIIDR fusion protein was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (21Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield a final concentration of 1.5 mg of protein bound per ml of resin. Antiserum (2 ml) generated against murine RIIα was incubated with 2 ml of RIIDR fusion protein-Sepharose 4B for 2 h at 20 °C. Next, the resin was packed into a column and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl until the flow-through reached an A280 of 0. The column was successively eluted with 5 ml of 0.5% acetic acid, pH 2.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 ml of 0.1 m diethylamine, pH 11.8, to release IgGs. Sufficient 1 m Na2HPO4 or 0.5 m Hepes was added to column fractions to adjust the pH to ∼7.5. IgGs were dialyzed against PBS containing 50% glycerol, quantified by absorbance at 280 nm, and stored at −20 °C. Drosophila embryos, larvae, pupae, or separated fly heads and bodies were suspended in 4 volumes of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 40 μg/ml leupeptin) and were disrupted in a Polytron homogenizer (two 30-s cycles of homogenization at the maximum setting). All operations were performed at 0–4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant solution (cytosol) was collected. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of buffer A, homogenized, and centrifuged as described above. The pelleted, particulate fraction of Drosophila homogenates was dispersed in the starting volume of buffer A by a final round of homogenization. Cytosolic and particulate proteins were prepared as indicated above, with several modifications. Buffer A was replaced with buffer B (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 20 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 mmbenzamidine·HCl, 100 μg/ml pefablock). Cells were disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer (tight) with 50 strokes of the pestle. Centrifugation was performed at 150,000 × g for 30–60 min. Proteins were denatured in gel loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis in 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS as described previously (21Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin (Mr = 200,000) phosphorylase b (97,000), transferrin (77,000), albumin (68,000), ovalbumin (45,000), and carbonic anhydrase (29,000) were used as standards for the estimation of Mr values. Anti-DAKAP200 serum (2 μl) was added to samples (300–500 μg of protein) of cytosolic proteins or Triton X-100 solubilized, membrane proteins from S2 or AV12 cells. After incubation at 4 °C for 16 h, 40 μl of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose 4B beads was added to the samples. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated 1 h with 5% milk proteins in phosphate-buffered saline, and washed three more times with PBS prior to addition to the sample containing antigen-IgG complexes. After 2 h on ice, beads were recovered by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min. The resin was then washed (4 °C) three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline lacking detergent. Finally, the beads were suspended in gel loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C in preparation for denaturing electrophoresis. The same procedure was used to immunoprecipitate RIIDR·DAKAP200 complexes with 4 μg of affinity-purified anti-RIIDR IgGs. Hamster AV12 cells (derived from a subcutaneous tumor) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Drosophila embryo-derived Schneider S2 cells were grown at 27 °C in Schneider's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Full-length cDNA encoding DAKAP200 was excised from plasmid pGEM7Z by digestion with Bam HI and Xba I. The Bam HI overhang was made blunt with Klenow DNA polymerase prior to digestion with Xba I. The cDNA fragment was then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIS2 (33Gorman C.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1990; 1: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which had been cleaved with Not I, blunted, and then cleaved with Xba I This placed DAKAP200 cDNA downstream from a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter and upstream from a polyadenylation signal. AV12 cells were transfected with recombinant pCis2 plasmid via calcium phosphate precipitation (34Li Y. Ndubuka C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16862-16869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Full-length RIIDR cDNA was excised from pGEM5Z by digestion with Sal I and Spe I. The cDNA fragment was cloned into the Drosophila expression plasmid pMK33 HS (generously provided by Dr. Nick Baker, Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) that was cleaved with Xho I and Spe I. This placed the RIIDR cDNA downstream from a strong, copper(II)-inducible metallothionein promoter/enhancer and upstream from a polyadenylation signal. pMK33 HS also contains a hygromycin resistance gene that is controlled by a constitutively active Copia promoter. S2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate·DNA co-precipitation method, and stable transfectants were obtained by growth in 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin for 14 days. Protein concentrations were determined with the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using bovine albumin as a standard. Western blots of cytosolic and particulate proteins from AV12 and S2 cells were blocked, incubated with antiserum, and washed as described previously (35Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DAKAP200, ΔDAKAP200, and RIIDR polypeptides were visualized by indirect chemiluminescence using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase coupled with goat immunoglobulins directed against rabbit IgG heavy and light chains (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 mNaCl and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 (10 ml of solution/gel lane) for 90 min at 22 °C. Filters were then washed, incubated with Luminol, and exposed to x-ray film for 2–30 s to record chemiluminescence signals. Relative amounts of proteins were determined by scanning densitometry (31Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7621-7624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Glantz S.B. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard curves were prepared with 0.5–100 ng of recombinant protein standards. Amounts of protein in experimental samples were obtained from the linear portion of the standard curve. Candidate cDNA clones for Drosophila AKAPs were isolated from an embryo cDNA expression library in bacteriophage λgt11. β-Galactosidase-AKAP fusion proteins in phage plaques were detected by their ability to bind 32P-labeled RII subunits (21Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-one cDNA clones were isolated from 4 × 105 phage. DNA hybridization analysis revealed that eight cDNAs encoded portions of the previously characterized DAKAP550 protein (13Han J.D. Baker N.E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26611-26619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts from five distinct, cross-hybridizing clones were ligated into the plasmid pGEM7Z and sequenced. The largest cDNA (1736 bp) contained an open reading frame for 476 codons, a translation stop signal, and 3′-untranslated sequence. Sequences of the smaller cDNAs were included within the 1.7-kbp cDNA. A 5′-stretched Drosophila embryo cDNA library in bacteriophage λgt11 and a gridded, high density library in the plasmid pNB40 (22Brown N.H. Kafatos F.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 23Hoheisel J.D. Lennon G.G. Zehetner G. Lehrach H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were screened by DNA hybridization to obtain sequences of upstream codons and the 5′-untranslated region. Nineteen cDNA clones were retrieved from the libraries. Eight nearly full-length or overlapping partial cDNAs were subcloned into pGEM7Z or pBluescript plasmids and sequenced to determine a derived amino acid sequence for an anchor protein named DAKAP200. The sequence of the largest DAKAP200 cDNA (3053 bp) is deposited in GenBankTM (accession number AF132884). A predicted initiator Met codon (nucleotides 155–157) is incorporated within an optimal translation start motif (ANNATGG, nucleotides 152–158) (36Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The putative 154-bp 5′-untranslated portion of the cDNA lacks alternative ATG sequences but includes translation stop codons in all reading frames. In addition, amino acid residues 1–7 constitute an acceptor site for myristoylation (see Fig.1), a modification that occurs at the N terminus of proteins. An open reading frame of 752 codons follows the initiator ATG and precedes a translation stop signal at nucleotides 2414–2416. The 3′-untranslated region comprises 614 bp and is followed by a polyadenylate tail. Processing of the 3′-end of DAKAP200 mRNA appears to be governed by either of two overlapping, atypical poly(A) addition signals (GATAAA or AATATA, nucleotides 3004–3014) that precede the polyadenylate tail by 22 or 17 nucleotides. DAKAP200 is composed of 753 amino acids and has a calculated Mr of 79,075 (Fig. 1). The anchor protein is exceptionally acidic (pI ∼3.8) and has an atypical amino acid composition. Glu, Asp, Ser, Thr, Ala, and Pro account for 61% of the residues in DAKAP200. In contrast, Cys, Met, Trp, and Tyr are included at only five positions (0.7% of total amino acids) in the polypeptide chain. DAKAP200 has an apparent Mrof 200,000 upon electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (see below). High net negative charge and aberrantly reduced electrophoretic mobility are properties shared between DAKAP200 and mammalian AKAPs (5Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar,9Chen Q. Lin R.Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most AKAPs have been assigned names that correspond to their apparent Mr values (5Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 6Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, the nameD rosophila Akinase anchor protein of200 kDa, or DAKAP200, is formulated in accord with standard nomenclature for anchor proteins. The DAKAP200 sequence is not highly homologous with sequences of previously studied polypeptides. However, several segments of the sequence shown in Fig. 1 provide clues about potential targeting, tethering (RII binding), and regulatory domains. The N terminus of DAKAP200 includes a Gly residue adjacent to the initiator Met and a Ser-Lys dipeptide at positions 6 and 7. This sequence (MG XXX SK) constitutes an optimal target site for the ubiquitous enzyme N-myristoyl-CoA transferase (38Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A segment of DAKAP200 that encompasses residues 119–148 (Fig. 1) includes a large cluster of Lys residues that create a highly basic (pI ∼11.5) and positively charged (+12) domain in the midst of a protein with a predicted overall charge of −116 at pH 7. The compositions of the basic region in DAKAP200 and a central portion of MARCKS and MARCKS-related proteins (MacMARCKS, F52, MRP) (39Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 40Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are similar, although the degree of amino acid identity is modest (≤30%) when the indicated sequences are aligned. The basic region of MARCKS proteins (named the phosphorylation site domain (PSD)) is a major target for protein kinase C-catalyzed phosphorylation in many mammalian cells (39Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar,40Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila anchor protein also possesses Pro-rich regions (amino acids 328–332 and 468–479; Fig. 1) that may serve as docking sites for proteins with Src homology 3 domains (41Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Fragments of genomic DNA that are cloned in P1 vectors are being sequenced and ordered by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (29Spradling A.C. Stern D.M. Kiss I. Roote J. Laverty T. Rubin G.M.

Newly synthesized MHC class II molecules are transported from the trans-Golgi network to MIICs, but previous studies of this important step in antigen processing have failed to conclusively determine whether most immature MHC class II complexes are transported directly to the processing compartments or are first transiently exposed at the cell surface. To attempt to resolve this question, I constructed a chimeric HLA-DRα chain containing two optimal tyrosine sulfation motifs. When expressed in a human B lymphoblastoid cell line lacking functional DRα chains, the chimera was correctly incorporated into complexes containing endogenous β and invariant chains, transported to the trans-Golgi network, and efficiently sulfated. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the sulfated complexes were rapidly transported to processing compartments with kinetics consistent with direct transport from the trans-Golgi network. The rate of maturation was not significantly altered in cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of dynamin under conditions where the endocytosis of transferrin was inhibited by 95%, confirming that endocytosis was not required for delivery to MIICs. Maturation of MHC class II-containing complexes was inhibited by aluminum fluoride and brefeldin A, indicating the involvement of heterotrimeric G-proteins and ADP-ribosylation factor in the transport event(s).

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 821-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In man, expression of MHC class II molecules is generally restricted to “professional” antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, activated macrophages, granulocytes, and T cells, although expression by other cell types can be induced by γ-interferon. In each case endosomal compartments enriched in MHC class II and referred to as MIICs (MHC II compartments) can be detected, which are believed to be the sites of peptide loading (2Nijman H.W. Kleijmeer M.J. Ossevoort M.A. Oorschot V.M.J. Vierboom M.P.M. Van de Keur M. Kenemans P. Kast W.M. Geuze H.J. Melief C.J.M. J. Exp.

B lymphoblastoid and B lymphoma cell lines constitutively express high levels of intracellular and cell surface MHC class II. Therefore, the majority of studies of human MHC class II-related antigen processing has been conducted using such cells. Although peptide exchange can occur, it is generally accepted that in B cells most antigenic peptides are loaded onto newly synthesized class II molecules (7Davidson H.W. Reid P.A. Lanzavecchia A. Watts C. Cell. 1991; 67: 105-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and that correctly formed αβ-peptide complexes are subsequently long lived (8Lanzavecchia A. Reid P.A. Watts C. Nature. 1992; 357: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus to understand fully the biochemistry of antigen processing and presentation, it is necessary to determine the nature and number of compartments through which newly synthesized MHC class II molecules pass. In most instances the intracellular trafficking of newly synthesized proteins can be defined by pulse-chase analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled molecules. However, investigation of MHC class II trafficking by this technique is severely complicated by the relatively asynchronous movement of MHC class II chains within the secretory pathway. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) newly synthesized class II α and β chains associate with the invariant chain (Ii) (9Cresswell P. Cell. 1996; 84: 505-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), a chaperone that acts both to mask the peptide binding groove (10Teyton L. O'Sullivan D. Dickson P.W. Lotteau V. Sette A. Fink P. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 11Roche P.A. Cresswell P. Nature. 1990; 345: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and direct complexes to endosomal compartments (12Bakke O. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1990; 63: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar,13Lotteau V. Teyton L. Peleraux A. Nilsson T. Karlsson L. Schmid S.L. Quaranta V. Peterson P.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Export from the ER requires the formation of a nonameric complex comprising an Ii trimer and three associated α and β chains. Assembly occurs via trimeric, pentameric, and heptameric intermediates and has an overall half-time of approximately 60 min (14Lamb C.A. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3478-3482PubMed Google Scholar). Thus export of radiolabeled molecules is asynchronous, since some labeled α or β chains associate with heptameric complexes and are exported within 10 min of the chase period, whereas others associate with Ii trimers and might still be retained in the ER 2 h later. Nonameric complexes rapidly traverse the Golgi stack but cannot readily be detected at the cell surface until 1–2 h after they have acquired terminal oligosaccharide modifications indicative of delivery to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (15Machamer C.E. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2564-2569PubMed Google Scholar). It is accepted that the complexes are retained in MIICs until peptide loading has occurred; however, there is still dispute as to whether the majority of αβIi complexes are transported directly from the TGN to MIICs (16Bénaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or transiently expressed at, and rapidly endocytosed from, the cell surface (17Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In order to address the precise post-Golgi trafficking of MHC class II molecules, an alternative strategy is required that restricts labeling to those molecules that have already been exported from the ER. Protein tyrosine sulfation is a ubiquitous late Golgi modification in mammalian cells that satisfies this requirement (reviewed in Ref. 18Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In most cells it is confined to the trans-Golgi/TGN (19Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and sulfate labeling has been used to study the biogenesis and trafficking of other TGN-derived vesicles (20Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. Cell. 1990; 60: 837-847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Miller S.G. Moore H.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 234-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A consensus sulfation motif has been defined (22Rosenquist G.L. Nicholas H.B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and Spiess and colleagues (23Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that fusion of a nonapeptide derived from procholecystokinin to the carboxyl terminus of either a soluble protein or a type II membrane protein allowed efficient sulfation of the resulting chimeras. None of the MHC class II chains contain any recognizable sulfation motif, so in order to obtain labeling I have created a novel chimeric HLA-DRα chain containing two optimal tyrosine sulfation motifs. I have expressed this chimera in a B lymphoblastoid cell line lacking functional DR molecules, and I show that it correctly associates with β and Ii chains, is efficiently sulfated, and rapidly exported from the TGN. To inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, without perturbing export from the TGN, I have utilized a temperature-sensitive mutant of dynamin 1 (24Wang K. Peterson P.A. Karlsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17055-17060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Damke H. Baba T. Van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J.

I show that under conditions where clathrin-dependent endocytosis of transferrin is inhibited by at least 95%, the rate at which sulfated MHC class II is delivered to protease-containing compartments is unchanged. This indicates that most newly synthesized MHC class II molecules transit directly from the TGN to MIICs in this B cell line. Tissue culture media and supplements were obtained from Sigma.

Plasmid pCD1 contains cDNA encoding human preprocathepsin D (34Faust P.L. Kornfeld S. Chirgwin J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4910-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) between the Hin dIII and Xba I sites of pBluescript (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). Oligonucleotides encoding the secretogranin I tyrosine sulfation site (sense 5′ TCGAGAGGATCCCCTTCGAAGAGGAACCTGAGTATGGCGCCCCCATGGT 3′; antisense 5′ CTAGACCATGGGGGCGCCATACTCAGGTTCCTCTTCGAAGGGG ATCCTC 3′) were annealed, digested with Bam HI, and ligated into pCD1 that had been digested with Bam HI and Xba I. The product (pCS1) contained the tyrosine sulfation site in frame with the cathepsin D signal peptide. A second aliquot of the annealed oligonuclotides was then digested with Bst BI and ligated into pCS1 cut with Nar I and Xba I to produce pCS2. The mature DRα chain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pE.DRα (gift of Dr. N. Holmes, University of Cambridge) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers designed to introduce unique Cla I and Xba I sites (sense 5′ CCATCGATGCACCCGGGGAAGAACATGTGATCATCC AGG 3′; antisense 5′ GGAATTCTAGAGAGGCCCCCTGCGTTCTGC 3′). The product was gel-purified, ligated into the Eco RV site of pBluescript, excised with Cla I and Xba I, and ligated into pCS2 cut with Nar I and Xba I to produce pCS3. The entire coding sequence of pCS3 was excised using Xho I and Not I and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pBJ (gift of Dr. M. Jackson, Scripps Research Institute) that contains the SRα promoter (35Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal, and aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene (36Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar), to form pYY-DRα. Plasmid for transfection was purified using Qiagen columns (Hybaid, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HMy2.DRN cells (2 × 107) were collected from culture, washed once with serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same medium. After transfer to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and incubation on ice for 10 min, 10 μg of pYY-DRα was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 min. The cells were then electroporated at 230 V and 960 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene pulser, allowed to recover on ice for 10 min, then returned to culture. After 24 h the media was supplemented with G418 (Calbiochem), initially at 0.9 mg/ml, and after an additional 24 h to a final concentration of 1.8 mg/ml. Resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution and, after 2 months at 1.8 mg/ml G418, maintained in media containing 0.9 mg/ml. A single clone expressing the modified HLA-DRα chain at high levels (YY1) was obtained and used for all subsequent experiments. Cells were collected from culture, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mg/ml BSA (PBS/BSA), and resuspended in PBS/BSA containing 5% (v/v) normal rabbit serum (1 × 107 cells/ml). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites, the cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in ice-cold PBS/BSA. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-(human HLA-DR) (clone G46-6; Becton Dickinson, Cowley, UK), or an appropriate isotype control (Sigma), was added, and the cells were incubated on ice with occasional mixing for 90 min. They were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS/BSA, once with PBS, and fixed in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSort. Clone YY1 cells (1.5 × 107) were collected from culture, washed twice with PBS/BSA, resuspended in sulfate-free basal medium Eagle's containing 5% dialyzed newborn calf serum at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated in a gassed incubator at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation at room temperature (4 min at 250 × g), washed once with sulfate-free medium lacking bicarbonate, and supplemented with 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and resuspended in 200 μl of the same medium. After preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, 50 μl of medium containing 0.25 mCi Na235SO4 (lyophilized stock; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 5–10 min with occasional mixing. The cells were then transferred to ice, diluted to 10 ml with ice-cold PBS/BSA containing 10 mm sodium sulfate, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. After a further wash in PBS/BSA-sulfate the cells were resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% newborn calf serum, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, adjusted to 1 mm sulfate, and chased at 37 °C for times as indicated. Finally the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, the medium discarded, and the cells lysed as described previously (37Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled class II was recovered with L243 + protein A (“mature”), or DA6.231 + protein G (total), and Ii with a combination of Bü45 and LN2 + protein G. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 12.5% gels and analyzed by phosphorimaging using a Fuji Bas2000 system. In some experiments eluted proteins were precipitated with 10 volumes of acetone previously chilled to −80 °C and collected by centrifugation. The precipitates were resuspended in 25 μl of 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.1% SDS, and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. The solutions were then cooled to room temperature, CHAPS added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 1 unit of N- glycanase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). An equal volume of twice concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer was then added, and the samples were analyzed as described above. Plasmid pTM1-HA-tsDyn (kindly provided by Dr. S. Schmid, La Jolla, CA) contains human dynamin 1 having an amino-terminal hemaglutinin epitope tag and the mutation G273D (25Damke H. Baba T. Van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMEP4 (Invitrogen) contains the human metallothionein IIA promotor allowing inducible expression of heterologous proteins in mammalian cells after treatment with heavy metal ions (38McNeall J. Sanchez A. Gray P.P. Chesterman C.N. Sleigh M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It also contains elements conferring resistance to hygromycin B treatment and the ability to replicate episomally in some cells. The entire coding sequence was excised with Spe I and Sal I and ligated into the Nhe I and Xho I sites of pMEP4 to form pDY8. Clone YY1 cells were transfected with pDY8 as described above and selected in medium supplemented with G418 (0.9 mg/ml) and 0.6 mg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C. A representative clone (YY1:DY8) was used for subsequent experiments. Mutant dynamin was induced by culturing clone YY1:DY8 in medium additionally supplemented with 100 μm ZnCl2 for 18–24 h at 31 °C. Following induction, high level expression was maintained in the absence of zinc for at least 8 h at 31 °C. YY1 cells (2 × 106) were collected from culture, washed once with PBS, and lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (107 cells/ml) at 0 °C. Protein in the clarified lysates was precipitated by the addition of 6 volumes of acetone previously cooled to −80 °C and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min, precipitates were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunological detection was by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal®, Pierce & Warriner, Chester, UK) and carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endocytosis of transferrin was measured using a modification of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocol of Smythe and colleagues (39Smythe E. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly this involved the use of biotinylated transferrin (Sigma) rather than BSST and two 2-min washes with 10 mm HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2, to remove surface ligand (40Subtil A. Hemar A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3461-3468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prior to solubilization. In order to focus upon movement of newly synthesized MHC class II between the late Golgi and compartments involved in antigen processing and peptide loading, I constructed a chimeric DRα chain that could be efficiently labeled with sulfate. Consideration of the crystal structure of HLA-DR1 (41Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar) suggested that a hydrophilic peptide fused to the amino terminus of the non-polymorphic α chain would be accessible to post-translational modification but unlikely to interfere with binding of Ii. Analysis of the kinetic properties of protein tyrosine sulfotransferases has shown that the apparent Km of peptide substrates decreases with increasing number of sulfation sites (42Niehrs C. Kraft M. Lee R.W.H. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8525-8532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, I constructed a chimera comprising the human cathepsin D signal peptide and two repeats of a sequence related to the sulfation site of bovine secretogranin 1, fused to Glu3 of HLA-DRα. The predicted structure of this chimera, including the expected amino terminus following signal peptide cleavage and sites of protein tyrosine sulfation, is indicated in Fig.1 A. LICR-LON-HMy2 is a variant of the plasma cell leukemia-derived B lymphoblastoid cell line ARH-77 (43Edwards P.A.W. Smith C.M. Neville A.M. O'Hare M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1982; 12: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). HMy2.DRN was generated by two rounds of γ-irradiation each followed by antibody and complement-mediated selection. The initial round was directed toward the HLA-A3 locus and isolated a line (HMy2.A3M) lacking an entire MHC haplotype. The second round was directed toward HLA-DR and identified a line (HMy2.DRN) in which the remaining DRα gene was mutated to encode a truncated protein that is rapidly degraded prior to export of αβIi complexes from the ER (27Koppelman B. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar). The cell expresses cell surface immunoglobulin G (44Diaz-Espada F. Milstein C. Secher D. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ but no HLA-DR. Western blot analysis of the HMy2.DRN-derived clone YY1 generated by transfection with cDNA encoding the chimeric α chain, using the DRα-specific antibody DA6.147 (29Guy K. Van Heyningen V. Cohen B.B. Deane D.L. Steel C.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1982; 12: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), demonstrated the stable expression of the chimeric chain (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). Similarly, FACS analysis confirmed that the chimeric chain restored surface expression of mature HLA-DR molecules (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 2, [35S]sulfate was rapidly incorporated into complexes containing the chimeric α chain. Without a subsequent chase incubation, radiolabeled proteins were efficiently precipitated with antibodies toward the lumenal domain of Ii (Fig. 2, lane 1) but could not be recovered using L243 (lane 2), an antibody whose epitope is masked in HLA-DR molecules which are associated with intact Ii (45Shackelford D.A. Lampson L.A. Strominger J.L. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1403-1410PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the radiolabel recovered using anti-Ii antibodies was present as a smear of apparent molecular mass of 45–80 kDa. This material was sensitive to digestion with chondroitinase A, B, C, consistent with previous observations that Ii is the protein core for B cell chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (46Giacoletto K.S. Sant A.J. Bono C. Gorka J. O'Sullivan D. Quaranta V. Schwartz B.D. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1422-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After a 2-h chase incubation less than 5% of the radiolabel was associated with intact Ii (lane 3) but was efficiently recovered with L243 (lane 4). Radiolabel precipitated with L243 was entirely resistant to chondroitinase digestion (data not shown). This suggests that the chondroitin sulfate present in the un-chased precipitates is exclusively associated with intact Ii chains, consistent with the conclusion that the Ii chain must be cleaved at a site membrane proximal to the site of proteoglycan addition in order to reveal the L243 epitope. At early time points the chimeric α chain migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa (Fig. 2). Subsequently it was converted in a time-dependent fashion to a 40-kDa form (Fig. 2, lane 4, and Fig.5 A). This chain could be precipitated with monoclonal DA6.147 (which recognizes both β chain-associated, and free, α chains) from denatured eluates previously precipitated with L243 (Fig.3 A, lane 2), confirming that it was indeed derived from the chimera. Conversion to the faster migrating form could be prevented by treatment with the membrane-permeant thiol protease inhibitor E64d, indicating that it was the result of proteolytic activity. Surprisingly, in addition to the 40–42-kDa band corresponding to the chimeric α chain, efficient labeling of the DRβ chain was also observed in immunoprecipitates of both immature and mature molecules (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4). This was unexpected since none of the tyrosine residues in this chain are located within the context of an optimal motif, and only minor labeling was observed in sulfate-labeled human tonsil cells (47Sant A.J. Zacheis M. Rumbarger T. Giacoletto K.S. Schwartz B.D. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar). I decided to investigate this further.Figure 3Characterization of sulfated MHC class II molecules. A, sulfate-labeled HLA-DR molecules were precipitated with L243 from detergent lysates of clone YY1 cells after a 2-h chase and eluted with non-reducing SDS sample buffer at 100 °C (lane 1). Eluted molecules were diluted 20-fold in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% CHAPS and re-precipitated with DA6.147 (lane 2) or TAL14.1 (lane 3). B, clone YY1 (lane 1) or HMy2.DRN stably expressing wild-type DRα (lane 2) were labeled with [35S]sulfate for 10 min. MHC class II molecules were recovered using anti-class II antibody DA6.231.C, clone YY1 cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (37Davidson H.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (lanes 1–4) or [35S]sulfate as decribed under “Materials and Methods” (lanes 5 and 6). Cells were chased for 4 (lanes 1–4) or 1 h (lanes 5 and 6) in an excess of “cold” label, and MHC class II molecules were collected with L243. Samples were treated with N- glycanase as described under “Materials and Methods” either directly (lanes 5 and 6) or after re-precipitation of the α (lanes 1 and 2) or β (lanes 3 and 4) chains, respectively.Lanes 1, 3, and 5 show the results of mock incubations, and lanes 2, 4, and 6 show the effects of N- glycanase digestion. The arrow shows the position of deglycosylated β chains determined in lane 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the 30-kDa sulfated species was indeed the DRβ chain, I re-precipitated denatured eluates previously recovered with L243 (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) with either DA6.147 or the DRβ chain-specific antibody TAL14.1 (30Maddox J.F. Bodmer J.G. Dupont B. Immunobiology of HLA, Immunogenetics and Histocompatibility. II. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1989: 373-375Google Scholar). As predicted, DA6.147 recognized the 40-kDa band and TAL14.1 the 30-kDa band in the denatured eluates (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2 and 3), confirming that both HLA-DR subunits were efficiently sulfated in clone YY1 cells. In contrast, neither the α nor the β chains were labeled with sulfate when HMy2.DRN cells stably expressing a DRα chain lacking the sulfation motifs were examined under identical conditions to those used for clone Y"
https://openalex.org/W2022681289,"Seismic wave reflections from Earth's core recorded at seismic arrays in North America from events in the Caribbean Islands, Venezuela, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have observed slownesses more than 64 percent greater than predicted by the IASPEI91 standard Earth model. P waves turning in the lowermost mantle beneath the same region also have anomalous slowness. The slowness anomalies are not accompanied by significant travel time residuals and appear to be caused by lateral inhomogeneities in the velocity structure of the lower mantle."
