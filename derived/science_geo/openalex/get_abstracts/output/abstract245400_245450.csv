https://openalex.org/W2168475193,"Tandemly repeated DNA sequences are highly dynamic components of genomes. Most repeats are in intergenic regions, but some are in coding sequences or pseudogenes. In humans, expansion of intragenic triplet repeats is associated with various diseases, including Huntington chorea and fragile X syndrome. The persistence of intragenic repeats in genomes suggests that there is a compensating benefit. Here we show that in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most genes containing intragenic repeats encode cell-wall proteins. The repeats trigger frequent recombination events in the gene or between the gene and a pseudogene, causing expansion and contraction in the gene size. This size variation creates quantitative alterations in phenotypes (e.g., adhesion, flocculation or biofilm formation). We propose that variation in intragenic repeat number provides the functional diversity of cell surface antigens that, in fungi and other pathogens, allows rapid adaptation to the environment and elusion of the host immune system."

In this study, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a mixture of free fatty acids (FFAs) to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying fat-induced insulin resistance. FFA treatment impaired insulin receptor-mediated signal transduction and decreased insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. FFAs activated the stress/inflammatory kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and IKKβ, and the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 3, increased secretion of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and decreased secretion of adiponectin into the medium. RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of JNK blocked JNK activation and prevented most of the FFA-induced defects in insulin action. Blockade of TNF-α signaling with neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α or its receptors or with a dominant negative TNF-α peptide had a partial effect to inhibit FFA-induced cellular insulin resistance. We found that JNK activation by FFAs was not inhibited by blocking TNF-α signaling, whereas the FFA-induced increase in TNF-α secretion was inhibited by RNA interference-mediated JNK knockdown. Together, these results indicate that 1) JNK can be activated by FFAs through TNF-α-independent mechanisms, 2) activated JNK is a major contributor to FFA-induced cellular insulin resistance, and 3) TNF-α is an autocrine/paracrine downstream effector of activated JNK that can also mediate insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance is characterized by a reduced ability of insulin to regulate glucose homeostasis in target tissues and is commonly associated with obesity, often preceding the clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

Many factors have been reported to induce insulin resistance in vitro and in vivo, including lipid- and fat-derived free fatty acids (FFAs) (2Bays H. Mandarino L. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear, evidence suggests that oversupplying FFAs causes intracellular accumulation of FFA-derived metabolic products (6Yu C. Chen Y. Cline G.W. Zhang D.

Consequently, IRS-1 activation through tyrosine phosphorylation is impaired, leading to a reduction in IR-mediated signaling and subsequent insulin resistance. Lipid infusion and high fat feeding also impair PI 3-kinase, Akt, and PKCλ/ξ activation in muscle (13Tremblay F. Lavigne C. Jacques H. Marette A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Kim Y.B. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32915-32922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and a defect in muscle PI 3-kinase and PKCλ/ξ activity is also observed in obese and diabetic subjects (15Kim Y.B. Kotani K. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is another important contributor to the development of insulin resistance (16Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). TNF-α levels are elevated in adipose tissue of various rodent obesity models and in obese humans (16Peraldi P. Spiegelman B. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Xu H. Uysal K.T. Becherer J.D. Arner P. Hotamisligil G.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1876-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), whereas a genetic defect in TNF-α signaling significantly improves IR signaling capacity and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced and genetically obese mice (18Uysal K.T. Wiesbrock S.M. Marino M.W. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). How TNF-α causes insulin resistance in adipose and skeletal muscle tissues is, however, not yet fully understood. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed that also involve the activation of JNK (19Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol.

TNF-α can also down-regulate the secretion of adiponectin, an effect that could cause insulin resistance (22Ruan H. Lodish H.F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Adiponectin is an abundant circulating cytokine secreted by adipocytes that sensitizes liver and skeletal muscle to insulin in rodents and humans. Adiponectin gene expression in both primary human preadipocytes and differentiated 3T3-L1 cells is suppressed by TNF-α treatment (23Kappes A. Loffler G. Horm. Metab. Res. 2000; 32: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Recently, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins 1 and 3 have been implicated as negative regulators of insulin signaling (24Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. Sci. STKE. 2003; 2003: PE6PubMed Google Scholar) and mediators of TNF-α-induced insulin resistance (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J. Hotamisligil G.S.

Conversely, genetic ablation of TNF-α signaling in ob/ob mice decreases white adipose tissue SOCS-3 expression and improves insulin sensitivity (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C.

Furthermore, in COS-7 cells, SOCS-3 can decrease insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its association with the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (25Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47944-47949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and SOCS-1 and -3 can bind to IRS-1 and IRS-2 to promote their ubiquitination-dependent degradation (27Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In the present study, we treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a mixture of FFAs to study the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperlipidemia-induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue. We demonstrated that FFAs induce insulin resistance by activating JNK and by increasing the secretion of TNF-α, which in an autocrine/paracrine fashion acts on cells to impair adipocyte function. Blocking JNK activation rescued the cellular and molecular defects induced by FFAs, whereas blocking TNF-α signaling only rescued some of these defects. Furthermore, blocking TNF-α signaling did not prevent activation of JNK by FFAs, indicating that TNF-α is a key but not the sole downstream effector of JNK-mediated, FFA-induced insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Materials—Antibodies against adiponectin and phosphotyrosine were purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Antibodies to Akt1/2, IRβ, and NF-κB, horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies, neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α and TNF receptors RI and RII, and control unconjugated Armenian hamster IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); and all other antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen; radioisotope was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Recombinant p110 CAAX and control recombinant adenoviruses were prepared as previously described (28Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14306-14314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Treatment—Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as previously described (29Worrall D.S. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, adipocytes were used 10–12 days after differentiation. After overnight incubation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% FFA-free bovine albumin (FFA-free BSA; ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with various concentrations of an FFA mixture composed of lauric, myristic, linoleic, oleic, and arachidonic acids (Sigma) or ethanol/PBS vehicle in the presence of 0.1% FFA-free BSA, for 1–6 h at 37 °C. FFA-free BSA was also used at 2.0% to simulate physiological serum albumin levels. These correspond to 20:1 and 3:1 ratios of FFA/BSA, respectively, given 300 μm FFA in 0.1% BSA and 1 mm FFA in 2.0% BSA, respectively. Western Blotting and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Analysis—Serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with or without FFA or insulin stimulation (bovine; Sigma) as indicated in each experiment. After harvesting conditioned medium for analysis, cells were lysed in cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates (20 μg) or conditioned media (30 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Following blocking, membranes were probed with specific antibodies and subsequently incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies for chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). Blots were stripped in Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed as indicated. Conditioned medium (50 μl) was also assayed for mouse TNF-α using an ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. GLUT4 Translocation Assay—This is a modified version of the method previously published (30Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, on day 5 postdifferentiation, 1 × 108 3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated with a plasmid containing the rat GLUT4 cDNA tagged with an HA epitope (in the first exofacial loop) and with GFP (at the carboxyl terminus; a generous gift from Dr. T. E. McGraw) using the Gene Pulser XCell (Bio-Rad) and plated onto coverslip bottom dishes (MaTek, Ashland, MA). Two days postelectroporation, the adipocytes were treated with or without 500 μm FFA for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1 or 2.0% BSA. The cells were then stimulated with 170 nm insulin for the indicated durations and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. HA-GLUT4-GFP was stained with mouse monoclonal anti-HA.11 (Covance, Princeton, NJ) followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunolabs, West Grove, PA). Fluorescence quantification was performed on a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope using a Nikon ×40 numerical aperture 1.3 oil objective, a TILL Photonics II monochromator, and a 12-bit Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera using Simple PCI software (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). At least 20 images were taken per time point, in which transfected cells were selected based on GFP expression. Calculations—In transfected cells, for each time point, the intensities of the GFP and Cy3 signals were quantified, and background GFP and Cy3 fluorescent emissions were subtracted. The Cy3 fluorescence intensity for each HA-GLUT4-GFP-expressing cell (reflecting cell surface HA-GLUT4-GFP) was divided by the GFP fluorescence intensity (reflecting total cellular HA-GLUT4-GFP level) to determine the fraction of tagged GLUT4 transporter at the membrane (arbitrary units). Translocation following insulin stimulation was expressed as -fold translocation over basal. 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DOG) Uptake—The assay for glucose uptake was described previously (29Worrall D.S. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Following overnight serum starvation, adipocytes were glucose-starved for 1 h in Hepes-salt buffer containing 0.1 or 2% FFA-free BSA. FFA was then added to the cells at the indicated concentrations for the indicated times. 10 min before the end of the FFA treatment, the cells were stimulated with insulin (1.7 or 17 nm) at 37 °C. Tracer glucose was then added for 10 min. After 20 min of insulin stimulation, glucose uptake was assayed in triplicate or quadruplicate wells for each condition using [1,2-3H]2-deoxy-d-glucose (0.2 μCi, 0.1 mm, 10 min) in at least 4–6 independent experiments. In experiments where cells were allowed to recover from the FFA treatments, the FFA-containing medium was removed, and the cells were incubated in fresh medium for 12 h prior to insulin stimulation and 2-DOG uptake assay. In experiments involving p110 CAAX overexpression, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell for 16 h at 37 °C with stocks of either p110 CAAX or control empty vector recombinant adenoviruses. At the end of the infection period, medium was replaced, and 48 h later, the cells were incubated in the starvation medium required for the 2-DOG uptake assay (see above). JNK Protein Knockdown—On day 5 postdifferentiation, 1 × 107 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation with 2.5 nmol of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified siRNA oligonucleotides to mouse JNK2 or scrambled siRNA or equal volumes of siRNA resuspension buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and plated into 12- and 24-well tissue culture plates. 24, 48, and 72 h postelectroporation, cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to evaluate intracellular JNK protein levels. In parallel, transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum- and glucose-starved, treated with FFA (500 μm, 3 h; 1 mm, 1 h) with or without insulin stimulation (17 nm, 20 min), and assayed for glucose uptake. Cell lysates were also prepared for Western blotting analysis of components of the insulin signaling cascade. Functional Rescue Experiments—Prior to the addition of FFAs, each well in a 12-well culture plate was supplemented with DN TNF-α peptide (2 μg), control peptide (2 μg), TNF-α-neutralizing antibody (2 μg), TNF-α receptor RI and RII neutralizing antibodies (1 μg each), or control Armenian IgG (2 μg), as indicated. The final concentrations of peptide and antibodies were 2 μg/ml. Experiments were also performed at final peptide and antibody concentrations of 10 μg/ml and peptide concentration of 25 μg/ml. Calculations—In 2-DOG uptake assays, the percentage rescue value was calculated as the ratio of the difference in glucose uptake between insulin-stimulated, untreated cells and insulin-stimulated FFA-treated cells over the difference in glucose uptake between insulin-stimulated, untreated cells and unstimulated, FFA-treated cells. Data Analysis—Values presented are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The statistical significance of the differences between various treatments was determined by one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction. The α level was set at 0.05. To better define how lipid infusion and high fat feeding cause insulin resistance, we used cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model system to investigate the mechanisms whereby FFAs induce cellular insulin resistance. We treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with a mixture of saturated (lauric and myristic acid) and unsaturated (arachidonic, oleic, and linoleic acid) FFAs at various concentrations and for various amounts of time and examined the impact on insulin signaling and adipocyte function. Down-regulation of IR-mediated Signaling by FFAs—Serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with various concentrations of FFAs, ranging from 300 μm to 1.0 mm, or vehicle control for 1–6 h in the presence of 0.1% BSA, with or without insulin stimulation (1.7 nm). Activation of the insulin signaling cascade was assessed in lysates of FFA-treated and control cells by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 1A shows representative results obtained from a 1-h treatment with 1 mm FFA. Similar results were obtained with 500 and 300 μm FFA treatments for 3 and 6 h, respectively, in the presence of 0.1 and 2.0% BSA and with 1.7 and 17 nm insulin stimulation (data not shown). Incubation with FFAs inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRβ and also caused a decrease in IRβ protein levels (∼40%). Similarly, insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and protein levels (∼40%) were reduced by FFAs. Downstream of IRS-1, insulin-stimulated Akt and PKCλ phosphorylation was inhibited by FFA treatment, indicating an insulin-resistant state. Total Akt and PKCλ protein levels were unaffected. Activation of Stress Kinases by FFAs—Since inflammation has been linked to insulin resistance (31Grimble R.F. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), we examined whether the stress/inflammatory kinases JNK and IKK are activated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with FFAs. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, regardless of insulin stimulation, FFA treatment dramatically increased phosphorylated JNK, despite lowering total JNK protein levels. IKKβ was also phosphorylated upon FFA treatment. Note the FFA treatment did not activate IKKα but decreased IKKα protein levels. This is in agreement with a previous report (32Anest V. Hanson J.L. Cogswell P.C. Steinbrecher K.A. Strahl B.D. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) showing that IKKα protein levels were lowered by 1 h of treatment with TNF-α. Consistent with IKKβ activation, IκBα, the inhibitor of NF-κB, was phosphorylated after 1 h of treatment with 1 mm FFA. The IκBα and NF-κB protein levels were not altered by this short incubation, in contrast to longer treatments (data not shown). Inhibition of Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 Translocation and Glucose Uptake by FFAs—To further define the effects of FFA treatment on insulin action, we examined the membrane targeting kinetics of the insulin-regulated GLUT4 transporter. We employed a single-cell GLUT4 translocation assay (30Subtil A. Lampson M.A. Keller S.R. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4787-4795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to directly quantify the amount of GLUT4 transporter targeted to the plasma membrane upon insulin addition. This technique relies on the transient transfection of a GLUT4 construct tagged with an HA epitope in the first extracellular loop and GFP in the intracellular C-terminal region (HA-GLUT4-GFP) into cells. For a given cell, the extent of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane can be quantitated by normalizing the immunofluorescent labeling of the extracellular HA epitope against total cellular GFP content. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, control cells responded to insulin by translocating HA-GLUT4-GFP to the cell surface in a biphasic mode, as previously reported; their cell surface GLUT4 increased by ∼2.8-fold at 5 min poststimulation, which persisted up to 25 min after insulin addition. At 15 min, a maximal 3.8-fold increase in membrane GLUT4 was observed. By contrast, FFA-pretreated cells (500 μm for 3 h) failed to translocate GLUT4 at 5 and 10 min poststimulation and only showed a 50% increase in cell surface GLUT4 at later time points. Thus, FFA treatment interfered with both phases of insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Note that FFA treatment, while impairing insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, increased basal translocation by ∼2-fold (data not shown). Because FFA-treated cells exhibited defective insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, we predicted that glucose uptake would also be impaired. We therefore assayed both basal and insulin-stimulated (1.7 nm) glucose uptake in these cells. Fig. 2B shows that FFA treatments (1 mm for 1 h, 0.5 mm for 3 h, and 0.3 mm for 6 h) inhibited ∼70–90% of the glucose uptake stimulated by 1.7 nm insulin. A similar inhibition was observed at 17 nm insulin (data not shown). This inhibition was fully reversed following FFA washout (Fig. 2B, hatched bars), indicating that the FFA treatment was not causing a nonspecific toxic effect. Of note is the FFA-induced increase in basal glucose transport (by ∼70%), which is consistent with the GLUT4 translocation results (Fig. 2A). To define the loci in the insulin signaling cascade where FFA-induced inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport occurs, we utilized an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active form of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, termed p110 CAAX (28Egawa K.

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, p110 CAAX adenovirus-mediated gene transfer leads to p110 CAAX expression and stimulates 2-DOG uptake by ∼4-fold in the absence of insulin (28Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N.

As illustrated in Fig. 2C, p110 CAAX expression had the expected effect of stimulating glucose uptake by 4-fold, with insulin treatment producing an additive effect to 9-fold stimulation. When the p110 CAAX-infected cells were treated with FFAs and stimulated with insulin, only the insulin-stimulated component of glucose uptake was substantially inhibited. This inhibitory effect was comparable with that seen in control cells infected with control adenovirus. These results suggest that the effects of FFAs on insulin-stimulated glucose transport are independent of PI 3-kinase. FFAs Decrease Adiponectin Secretion—Since low circulating levels of adiponectin also correlate with inflammatory states and insulin resistance (33Kershaw E.E. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that FFA treatment down-regulates adiponectin secretion directly in adipocytes. Conditioned medium was harvested from FFA-treated (1 mm, 1 h) and untreated cells for SDS-PAGE and adiponectin immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, FFA-treated cells secreted ∼35 and 15% less adiponectin without and with insulin stimulation, respectively, despite similar intracellular adiponectin protein content (Fig. 3A), indicating that FFA treatment inhibits adiponectin release at the secretory stage. Moreover, FFA treatment inhibited the increase in adiponectin secretion induced by insulin stimulation, decreasing it from 155 to 85% in the presence of FFAs. Similar results were obtained with 300 μm (6-h) and 500 μm (3-h) FFA treatments (data not shown). Inhibition of FFA-induced JNK Activation—To test whether FFA-induced JNK kinase activation mediates FFA-induced cellular insulin resistance, we blocked the FFA-induced activation of the JNK pathway via RNA interference. We electroporated 3T3-L1 adipocytes with two independent siRNAs to mouse JNK2 (mJ2A and mJ2B) and measured JNK2 protein levels 48 h later (Fig. 4A, 24 and 72 h data not shown). Both siRNAs effectively decreased endogenous JNK2 protein levels without altering intracellular levels of actin or other intracellular proteins (not shown); they also decreased JNK1 protein levels.

Studies under standard (static) culture conditions revealed that normal airway epithelia possess an adenosine-regulated pathway that blends Na+ absorption and Cl- secretion to optimize PCL volume. In cystic fibrosis (CF), the absence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator results in a failure of adenosine regulation of PCL volume, which is predicted to initiate mucus stasis and infection. However, under conditions that mimic the phasic motion of the lung in vivo, ATP release into PCL was increased, CF ion transport was rebalanced, and PCL volume was restored to levels adequate for lung defense. This ATP signaling system was vulnerable, however, to insults that trigger CF bacterial infections, such as viral (respiratory syncitial virus) infections, which up-regulated extracellular ATPase activity and abolished motion-dependent ATP regulation of CF PCL height. These studies demonstrate (i) how the normal coordination of opposing ion transport pathways to maintain PCL volume is disrupted in CF, (ii) the hitherto unknown role of phasic motion in regulating key aspects of normal and CF innate airways defense, and (iii) that maneuvers directed at increasing motion-induced nucleotide release may be therapeutic in CF patients.

The lung must continually defend itself against bacteria that deposit on airway surfaces during normal tidal breathing. It appears that mechanical clearance of bacteria mediated by mucus transport is the principal innate defense mechanism of mammalian airways (1Wine J.J. J. Clin.

In cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, it appears that the primary pathophysiologic defect is the depletion of PCL volume, resulting in a failure of mucus clearance of bacteria and persistent airways infection (7Matsui H.

However, questions have been raised as to the relevance of PCL depletion to CF pathogenesis in vivo (9Gibson R.L. Burns J.L. Ramsey B.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 918-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). For example, whereas in vitro data from standard (static) culture systems describe rapid depletion of PCL height and a complete failure of mucus transport (7Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R.

Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), young CF patients exhibit reduced but measurable rates of mucus clearance in vivo (10Robinson M. Bye P.T.B. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2002; 33: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This inconsistency suggests that mechanisms for PCL height regulation operating in vivo are absent from standard static culture systems. In addition, clinical observations suggest that CF lung disease exacerbates intermittently and is heterogeneous. Often, viral infections trigger these disease exacerbations (11Armstrong D.

To investigate these questions, we used a well differentiated airway epithelial culture system that exhibits PCL volume regulation and mucus transport (7Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Based on the observations that (i) tidal volume expansion and airflow impart shear to airway surfaces (13Basser P.J. McMahon T.A. Griffith P. J. Biomech. Eng. 1989; 111: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), (ii) shear releases nucleotides from many cell types into the extracellular environment (14Burnstock G. Clin.

Accordingly, we developed a novel culture system that mimics the best characterized shear stress in the lung, i.e. the phasic motion-induced shear that is associated with normal tidal breathing. Finally, we used a respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) encoding the GFP protein (18Zhang L. Peeples M.E. Boucher R.C. Collins P.L. Pickles R.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5654-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) to study the relationship between RSV infection and the capacity of CF cells to maintain a PCL under phasic motion culture conditions. Human Airway Epithelial Cultures—Cells were obtained from freshly excised bronchial specimens from normal (NL; n = 15; 4-55 years; 9 males, 6 females) and CF subjects (n = 21; 13-49 years; 12 males; 9 females; 13 ΔF/ΔF, 4 ΔF/other, 4 unknown genotype) by protease digestion (7Matsui H.

LaVeck M.A. J. Tiss. Cult. Meth. 1985; 9: 43-48Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar) media under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions, and studied when fully differentiated (2-5 weeks). Cultures with transepithelial resistances (Rt)of >200 ohms-cm2 were studied and were kept in a highly humidified incubator between readings (7Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy Measurement of PCL—PBS (20 μl) containing 2 mg/ml Texas Red-dextran (10 kDa; Molecular Probes) was added to cultures. To measure the average height of the PCL, 5 predetermined points, 1 central and four 2 mm from the edge of the culture, were XZ scanned (19Tarran R. Boucher R.C. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 70: 479-492PubMed Google Scholar). For all studies, perfluorocarbon (PFC; FC-77) was added mucosally to prevent evaporation of the PCL (20Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the culture was placed on the stage of the confocal microscope over a serosal reservoir (80 μl TES-buffered Ringer). Measurement of Transepithelial Potential Difference (Vt)—A macro-electrode (polyethylene tubing with 3 m KCl, 4% agar) was placed in the serosal bath, and a 3 m KCl-filled glass microelectrode was positioned by a micromanipulator into the PCL to stably record Vt. PFC was added to the mucosal surface during the period of recording to avoid PCL evaporation. Morphologic Studies—We utilized a non-aqueous fixative that preserves the topology of the PCL in situ (7Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Cultures were fixed using 1% osmium tetraoxide in perfluorocarbon (OsO4/PFC; FC-72). After fixation, samples were directly immersed in 100% ethanol, processed for epon/araldite resin embedding using conventional procedures, and sections prepared for electron microscopy. Measurement of Mucus Transport Rates—PBS (20 μl), containing a 0.02% v/v fluorescent microsphere suspension (1 μm, green fluorescence), was added to cultures screened for rotational mucus and Na+ transport. Measurements of mucus transport were made at t = 0 h and 48 h later for cultures under static versus phasic motion conditions from 5-s exposure images acquired with an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany) and a CCD camera (Hamamatsu C5985, Japan), and the linear velocity of bead transport was analyzed as previously reported (7Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Phasic Motion Culture System and Generation of Shear Forces—We elected to accelerate/decelerate the cultures inside a highly humidified incubator to deliver phasic shear stress to avoid airflow-induced evaporation of the PCL. The change in velocity caused by this phasic motion generated shear stress over the apical cell membrane with profiles similar to airflow-induced shear stress (see the supplemental material). We built a series of devices to control the magnitude and frequency of the phasic motion/shear stress exerted on human bronchial airway epithelial cultures. The prototype device was built from motorized Lego (Billund, Denmark) coupled to a signal generator, which provided the voltage to power the motor. Subsequent, computer controlled rotational devices were machined in-house with identical dimensions. Four cultures housed in a 6-well plate (4.5 cm equidistant from the center of rotation) were placed in this motorized device, and a square wave was generated at 0.5-1 Hz to drive the DC motor, rotating the cultures in a stop/go fashion. Because of the inertia of the device, this resulted in an acceleration period of 100 ms rather than an instantaneous increase in velocity as implied by the square wave signal. Consequently, the device produced a maximal velocity of 16.6 cm/s at the center of each culture for 550 ms, with acceleration/deceleration periods of 100 ms and 7 stop/starts per 360°. This change in velocity was similar to changes seen during in vivo inspiration during normal tidal breathing as a recorded by a pneumotachometer (see the supplemental material). For the dose-response to phasic motion, the rates of acceleration/deceleration were altered from 1 s (0.06 dynes/cm2) to 10 ms (6 dynes/cm2) while maintaining 28 cycles/min of phasic motion (note that to generate 0.06 dynes/cm2 of phasic motion while maintaining 28 cycles/min, it was also necessary to decrease the maximum angular velocity to generate the reduced rate of shear stress). Note, normal tidal breathing has both inspiratory and expiratory airflows, so for 14 breaths/min there are 28 cycles/min of shear stress. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) and Vt—Ca2+i and Vt were measured in CF epithelial cultures on T-Col membranes interfaced to a microfluorimeter (21Paradiso A.M. Ribeiro C.M.P. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 53-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Luminal perfusion (Na+-free KBr ± apyrase) was initiated and stopped at 5-min intervals, whereas KBr perfusion was continuous in the basolateral compartment. Calculations based on the geometry (volume) of the chamber and flow rate to predict shear force were performed as follows. The inlet flow rate of Ringers solution (ρ ∼ 1 g/cm3) into the luminal chamber was 4 cm3/min (Q) through 20-gauge tubing (r = 0.0292 cm inner radius, V = Q/πr2), which directed flow downward to the luminal surface of the culture at a 30° angle. Thus, the force exerted on the surface of the culture was F = ρQV sinθ = 0.83 dynes. This inlet jet exited from tubing 0.6 cm away from the culture surface, directed toward the center of the culture surface, a circular disk of ∼0.15 cm in radius. Jet flow upon leaving tubing entrains the surrounding fluid and expands, and the momentum of the flow is transferred to the surrounding fluid. For a water system the jet entrainment angle for a circular jet is about 14°. In this case this would distribute force over almost the entire disk culture surface of 0.1 cm2. Therefore, the expected shear stress applied in this case was ∼8 dynes/cm2. Measurement of PCL ATP and adenosine (ADO) Concentrations—Pilot studies revealed that it was difficult to sample PCL after >3 h due to the viscosity of PCL but that [nucleotide] after a maneuver reached a new steady state within 15 min. Therefore, at t = 0, 50 μl of PBS ± 5 units of apyrase was placed on the culture surface, the culture placed in the incubator under static or phasic motion conditions, and 5-10 μl of PCL was sampled 1 h later by microcapillary pipettes lowered onto the culture surface with a micromanipulator. ATP was measured by luminometry (22Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and ADO was measured by HPLC after etheno-derivatization (23Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R.

Virus Infection and ATPase Activity—CF airway epithelia were inoculated with a recombinant replication-competent RSV encoding a GFP reporter gene (18Zhang L. Peeples M.E. Boucher R.C. Collins P.L. Pickles R.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5654-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) 48 h before confocal measurements of PCL height. Parallel cultures had extracellular hydrolysis measured with [γ-32P]ATP or Ap4A by HPLC as previously described (24Picher M. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11256-11264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For media transfer studies, PCL and culture media was collected with micropipettes, exposed to UV light for 30 min to kill viruses, and transferred to uninfected cultures. Solutions and Chemicals—During thin film experiments, cultures were bathed serosally in a TES-buffered, modified Ringer solution, and PBS was used as a volume load and for washing the apical surface. Amiloride (300 μm), Ap4A (100 μm), apyrase (5 units/ml), bumetanide (100 μm), 8-SPT (10 μm), and all salts were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All fluorescent compounds and DIDS were obtained from Molecular Probes. [γ-32P]ATP (10 μm) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. PFCs (FC-72 and FC-77) were obtained from 3M and had no effect on PCL height, rotational mucus transport rate, PCL [Cl-], or Vt as previously reported (8Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Parsons D. Picher M.

Bumetanide was dissolved as a concentrated stock in Me2SO and diluted 1000-fold in the serosal bath to give the final concentration (100 μm). DIDS and CFTRinh172 were added to the initial 20 μl of PBS at t = 0 with Texas Red-dextran where appropriate. The other compounds were added as dry powders suspended in PFC (FC-72) (8Tarran R.

Statistics—Parametric statistics (analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test to determine significant differences among groups) were used where the variances were homogeneously distributed. In the case of non-homogeneity of variance, significance of difference between means was determined by either analysis of variance followed by Dunn's multiple comparison test, the Mann-Whitney U test, or the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test as appropriate. All values are expressed as the means ± S.E., where n represents the number of cultures (a minimum of three donors provided tissues per experiment). Standard (Static) Air-Liquid Interface Culture Conditions; NL Versus CF PCL Volume Regulation—We removed accumulated mucus before each experiment to measure PCL volume regulation without the buffering effect of the mucus layer (20Tarran R. Grubb B.R. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and initiated each experiment by adding an excess volume of PCL in the form of an isotonic solution similar to PCL in vivo (25Knowles M.R. Robinson J.M. Wood R.E. Pue C.A. Mentz W.M. Wager G.C. Gatzy J.T. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2588-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 26Caldwell R.A. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Barker P.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Normal bronchial epithelial cultures absorbed the added (“excess”) PCL volume over a period of ∼12 h following which absorption ceased, and PCL volume was maintained at the height of the extended cilium (∼7 μm), i.e. the definition of optimal PCL volume/height (Fig. 1, a and b). In contrast, CF bronchial epithelia absorbed PCL more rapidly and did not stop absorbing PCL until a height of ∼3 μm was reached (Fig. 1, a and b). An electron microscopy technique visualized the PCL in NL versus CF cultures after 48 h of PCL volume regulation (7Matsui H. Grubb B.R. Tarran R. Randell S.H. Gatzy J.T. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). The 7-μm height on NL culture surfaces was associated with fully extended cilia and an electron lucent zone that represented PCL (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the cilia of the CF airway epithelia were bent over and tightly packed (Fig. 1c). The ciliary shaft is heavily glycosylated so that the residual 3 μm of liquid on CF airway surfaces is likely associated with the glycocalyx on ciliary shafts and the cell surface and not available for absorption by active ion transport. The two phases of PCL volume regulation by NL airway epithelia, i.e. rapid removal of liquid from airway surfaces (0-12 h), followed by a steady state volume (12-48 h), suggested that active ion transport systems had been adjusted (Fig. 1b). To identify the ion transport processes involved in this regulation, we measured the transepithelial potential difference (Vt) under basal conditions and following sequential exposure to blockers of Cl- secretion (bumetanide) and Na+ absorption (amiloride). At t = 0, amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport dominated (Fig. 1d). When PCL had achieved a steady state height of ∼7 μm (48 h), Vt dropped (-11.2 ± 0.9 mV at t = 0; -7.5 ± 0.7 mV at t = 48 h, p < 0.05, n = 9), suggesting a slowing of total ion transport. Analysis of each component of Vt revealed that amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport fell and bumetanide-sensitive Cl- secretion persisted and became dominant. The pattern for CF cultures was distinctly different. First, Vt did not decrease over time (-11.4 ± 1.0 mV at t = 0; -10.2 ± 1.3 mV at t = 48 h, n = 6) despite the fact that PCL volume absorption was excessive (Fig. 1, a and b). Furthermore, Vt remained entirely amiloride-sensitive (Fig. 1d), suggesting that, unlike in NLs, Na+ transport rates were not regulated. Second, the amiloride-sensitive Vt was greater in CF than NL cultures at both t = 0 and t = 48 h (Fig. 1d), consistent with an abnormally high rate of CF Na+ transport. Third, no significant bumetanide-sensitive Vt was detected at either t = 0 or 48 h, suggesting that CF cultures could not secrete Cl- basally or in response to a low PCL volume. Thus, despite the excessive loss of PCL volume, CF airway epithelia exhibited an unregulated, abnormally high rate of Na+ transport and no Cl- secretion. Extracellular Nucleotide/Nucleoside Regulation of PCL Volume—Triphosphate nucleotides (e.g. ATP) have been shown both to inhibit Na+ absorption via P2Y2 receptors (16Mason S.J. Paradiso A.M. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and stimulate Cl- secretion also via P2Y2-R, perhaps in combination with P2X (17Zsembery A.

Under these static culture conditions, NL PCL [ATP] was 1.2 ± 0.2 nm (n = 6), which is insufficient to activate P2Y2-R. However, we also functionally tested for a role for ATP in PCL regulation by the addition of apyrase, an enzyme that rapidly degrades ATP to AMP (28Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). As compared with control rates of PCL volume absorption, the addition of apyrase to the PCL of NL or CF cultures had no detectable effect on the initial rate of volume absorption (compare 0-2 h data in Fig. 2b to Fig. 1b). This result suggests the basal levels of ATP were below those required to inhibit Na+ transport under static conditions (see Fig. 5a). However, apyrase was associated with a greater PCL height at 48 h in NL but not CF epithelia (Fig. 2, a and b). The response of NL epithelia to apyrase led us to speculate that this compound had increased the production of ADO that, interacting with the A2b subclass of P-1 purinoceptors to raise cellular cAMP, had increased the rate of CFTR-dependent Cl- secretion (23Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 29Lazarowski E.R. Mason S.J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C361-C369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three observations were consistent with this notion. First, the apyrase-treated cultures exhibited a raised Vt (-14.0 ± 2.0 mV) at 48 h as compared with non-apyrase-treated cultures (Vt -7.5 ± 0.7 mV), consistent with acceleration of electrogenic Cl- secretion (n = 6). Second, the absolute magnitude of the bumetanide-sensitive Vt, i.e. Cl- secretion, was increased in the presence of apyrase (Fig. 2c) versus without apyrase (Fig. 1d, p < 0.05). Third, an adenosine receptor blocker, 8-SPT, completely blocked the apyrase-induced increase in PCL and indeed reduced PCL volume to CF-like depths, i.e. 3 μm (Fig. 2b), strongly supporting a role of increased ADO production as the stimulus for raised CFTR-mediated Cl- secretion in apyrase-treated NL cultures. The observation that 8-SPT reduced PCL volume to CF-like levels (Fig. 2b) suggested that ADO may control basal CFTR activity (23Huang P. Lazarowski E.R. Tarran R. Milgram S.L. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14120-14125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The PCL ADO concentration was sufficient (100 ± 19 nm; n = 10) to activate A2b receptors (A2b-R), the dominant adenosine receptor in airway epithelia (29Lazarowski E.R. Mason S.J. Clarke L.L. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 106: 774-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, to test this notion directly, we exposed NL airway epithelial cells under basal conditions to 8-SPT and found 8-SPT alone reduced PCL heights into the range of CF cultures (3 μm) (Fig. 2d). Despite similar ADO levels (162 ± 30 nm; n = 7), 8-SPT was without effect on CF cultures (Fig. 2d). These data suggest that the presence of a partially activated CFTR channel is important for regulating PCL volume and that ADO contained within PCL is the major regulator of basal CFTR activity in our airway culture system. Phasic Motion (Shear Stress) Culture Conditions; Normal Versus CF Bronchial Epithelial PCL Volume Regulation—Breathing imparts shear on pulmonary surfaces by airflow-induced shear stress, cyclic compressive (transmural) shear, and stretch (13Basser P.J.

However, calculation of total shear-stress on pulmonary surfaces has been difficult, and comprehensive model systems are unavailable. We focused our studies on the best characterized component of breathing-induced shear, i.e. the shear stress due to tidal oscillations in airflow. Estimates of the magnitude of this shear stress range between ∼0.4 and 2dynes.cm-2 (see Fig. 3a and the supplemental material).

We have shown previously that statins inhibit a β-amyloid (Aβ)-mediated inflammatory response through mechanisms independent of cholesterol reduction. Specifically, statins exert anti-inflammatory actions through their ability to prevent the isoprenylation of members of the Rho family of small G-proteins, resulting in the functional inactivation of these G-proteins. We report that statin treatment of microglia results in perturbation of the cytoskeleton and morphological changes due to alteration in Rho family function. Statins also block Aβ-stimulated phagocytosis through inhibition of Rac action. Paradoxically, the statin-mediated inactivation of G-protein function was associated with increased GTP loading of Rac and RhoA, and this effect was observed in myeloid lineage cells and other cell types. Statin treatment disrupted the interaction of Rac with its negative regulator the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI), an interaction that is dependent on protein isoprenylation. We propose that lack of negative regulation accounts for the increased GTP loading. Isoprenylation of Rac is also required for efficient interaction with the plasma membrane, and we report that statin treatment dramatically reduces the capacity of Rac to interact with membranes. These results suggest a mechanism by which statins inhibit the actions of Rho GTPases and attenuate Aβ-stimulated inflammation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been reported to reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease.

These results suggest a mechanism by which statins inhibit the actions of Rho GTPases and attenuate Aβ-stimulated inflammation. The primary action of statins is the inhibition of HMG-CoA 2The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; Aβ, β-amyloid; AD, Alzheimer disease; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; fAβ, fibrillar β-amyloid; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; GGpp, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PAK, p21-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. reductase, blocking the de novo synthesis of cholesterol and resulting in lower plasma cholesterol levels (1Tobert J.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). However, recent observations demonstrate that statins have pleiotropic actions that are not dependent on cholesterol reduction (2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 45: 89-118Crossref Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Specifically, statins have been shown to inhibit vascular inflammation, enhance endothelial function, inhibit the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle, reduce platelet activation and aggregation, and increase atherosclerotic plaque stability. Many of these effects were postulated to arise from disruption of the actions of small G-proteins. Although blockade of HMG-CoA reductase prevents de novo synthesis of cholesterol, it also decreases the pools of intermediate metabolites in the biosynthetic pathway that have ancillary functions. The post-translational modification of various cellular proteins with the isoprenoids farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) is negatively affected by statin-mediated inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Small G-proteins of the Ras superfamily are among the principal targets of statin actions because of their isoprenylation. This modification of small G-proteins is crucial for their regulation through protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions with their regulators and effectors (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Small G-proteins are involved in many cellular functions including cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell motility, phagocytosis, intracellular trafficking, transcriptional regulation, cell growth, and development (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). The Rho subfamily of small G-proteins regulates the actin-based cytoskeleton. Activation of RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 leads to the formation of stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (5Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The Rho family also plays critical roles in inflammatory signal transduction cascades. RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 participate in the signaling pathways required for the activity of NF-κB, leading to the induction of cytokines and chemokines (6Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of NF-κB has been linked to Rho-dependent activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway (6Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C.

Rac is essential for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase, which is responsible for the defensive production of reactive oxygen species (8Lambeth J.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). Although the pleiotropic effects of statins were first observed by cardiovascular biologists, many of the anti-inflammatory actions have been demonstrated in animal models of central nervous system diseases with an inflammatory component including multiple sclerosis and ischemic stroke (9Youssef S. Stuve O. Patarroyo J.C. Ruiz P.J. Radosevich J.L. Hur E.M. Bravo M. Mitchell D.J. Sobel R.A. Steinman L. Zamvil S.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 10Miida T.

Neurol. 2003; 16: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Several epidemiological studies and small clinical studies have suggested that statins reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD); however, this linkage remains controversial (12Jick H.

Arch. Neurol. 2005; 62: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We reported that the anti-inflammatory actions of statins in Aβ-stimulated microglia are independent of cholesterol reduction but are a consequence of the reduction of cellular levels of the isoprenoid GGpp (16Cordle A. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These effects were reported to depend on the disruption of Rho family function, which was demonstrated to be the result of lack of isoprenylation of these G-proteins. Statins have clearly been demonstrated to disrupt G-protein functions, and this disruption, in turn, prevents various inflammatory responses. However, the specific effects statins have on G-protein regulation and localization have not been clearly delineated. We report that statin-mediated inhibition of isoprenylation prevented Rho family members from interacting with RhoGDI, resulting in increased levels of GTP-loaded G-proteins. Lack of isoprenylation also prevented translocation to the plasma membrane. These effects culminated in the functional inhibition of Rho-family G-proteins. We suggest that the salutary effects of statins in reducing the risk for AD may arise, in part, from inhibition of microglia-mediated inflammatory responses. Materials and Reagents—β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides Aβ-(25-35) and Aβ-(1-42), purchased from the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA), were dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 2 mm and then incubated for 5 days at 37 °C to induce fibril formation (17Burdick D.

Simvastatin and lovastatin were obtained from Calbiochem and prepared following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the statin was converted to its active form by dissolving it in absolute ethanol (20 μl/μg statin to final concentration of 55.0% (v/v) ethanol) followed by addition of 1 n NaOH (to final concentration of 0.45 m). This solution was stored at -20 °C until use. Immediately prior to use the statin solution was neutralized (pH 7.2) with 1 n HCl. Mevalonic acid and cholesterol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Calbiochem, respectively, and reconstituted in 100% ethanol. The GGpp transferase inhibitor GGTI-286 was purchased from Calbiochem and reconstituted in Me2SO. Nile red FluoSpheres (1 μm microspheres) and rhodamine phalloidin was purchased from Invitrogen. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate triammonium salt was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and dissolved in 70% ethanol. PAK-GST and rhotekin-GST fusion beads were purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Antibodies recognizing Rac (05-389) and flotillin-1 (610821) were purchased from Upstate (Waltham, MA), Calbiochem, Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and BD Biosciences, respectively. Antibodies to RhoA (SC-179) and RhoGDI (SC-360) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—THP-1 monocytes and BV-2 mouse microglial cell lines were employed because of their ability to respond to fibrillar Aβ (fAβ), (but not non-fibrillar forms of Aβ) through mechanisms that are identical to those in primary microglia (20Koenigsknecht J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human THP-1 monocytes were obtained from American Type Tissue Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, Maryland) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. RPMI medium was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; catalog number SH30397.03, Hyclone, Logan, UT), 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 15 μg/ml gentamycin. At the beginning of each experiment, THP-1 cells were collected and resuspended in RPMI medium containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Mouse BV-2 microglia were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The DMEM was supplemented with 2% FBS, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 15 μg/ml gentamycin. Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells were cultured in DMEM/Opti-MEM (4.5:5), which was supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamate. Rat PC12 pheochromocytoma were cultured in DMEM at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The DMEM was supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% FBS, and 15 μg/ml gentamycin. Phagocytosis Assay—Microglial phagocytosis was assessed exactly as described by Koenigsknecht and Landreth (20Koenigsknecht J. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9838-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) using BV-2 microglia, which faithfully reproduce the phagocytic actions of primary microglia. Briefly, BV-2 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto 35-mm plates, the serum concentration was lowered to 2%, and the cells were treated with simvastatin or lovastatin overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were then incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of 60 μm fibrillar Aβ-(25-35) (63.6 μg/ml) peptide or 5 μm fAβ-(1-42) (22.6 μg/ml) peptide. Fluorescent microspheres were then added to the cells for 30 min after having been washed in PBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The uptake of fluorescent microspheres was used as a marker of fluid phase phagocytosis. Cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and three random fields of cells (>100 cells) were counted on an inverted microscope. Phalloidin Staining—BV-2 cells (1.5 × 105) were collected, plated on coverslips resting in 24-well plates, and incubated in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were rinsed with PBS before being fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and washed again in PBS. The cells were then incubated at room temperature with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer for 5 min and washed again in PBS. F-actin was visualized by incubation of the cells with rhodamine phalloidin (final concentration of 0.007 units/μl) at room temperature and protected from light for 30 min. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides, and images were acquired at 40× or 20× magnification. Isolation of GTP-loaded Small G-proteins—THP-1 cells (10 × 106), BV-2 cells (7 × 106), N2a cells (5 × 106), or PC12 cells (6 × 106) were plated into 6-well dishes. The cells were treated with simvastatin, lovastatin, or GGTI-286 with or without the addition of mevalonic acid, cholesterol, or GGpp overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were lysed, and activated G-proteins were isolated by the ability of the active GTP-loaded species to interact with effector protein binding domains. Briefly, cells were washed with calcium/magnesium-free PBS and then lysed by the addition of lysis buffer followed by trituration. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Activated Rac and RhoA were isolated by the incubation of 1 mg of protein sample with 20 μg of PAK-GST beads or Rhotekin-GST beads, respectively, for 1 h at 4°C. The bead-protein complexes were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in 10 μl of 1.5× Laemmli sample buffer but were not boiled. The samples were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then probed with antibodies recognizing Rac or RhoA. Aliquots of the cellular lysates were probed to monitor total cellular levels of the small G-proteins. Band intensities were quantified using a Bio-Rad VersaDoc image analysis hardware/software package. RhoGDI-Rac Interaction—THP-1 cells (10 × 106) were plated into 6-well plates. The cells were treated with simvastatin overnight. Cells were lysed with a 1% Triton lysis buffer followed by sonication on ice for 10 s. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cellular lysates (1 mg) were combined with 30 μl of protein A beads and 2 μg of anti-RhoGDI antibody in a final volume of 500 μl. The samples were rotated for 2 h at 4°C and then washed extensively with lysis buffer, resuspended in 1.5× Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled. Standard Western blotting protocols were used to separate and transfer samples to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and then probed with anti-Rac antibodies to monitor the association of Rac with RhoGDI. Protein loading was evaluated by reprobing the blot with anti-RhoGDI antibodies. Band intensities were quantified using a Bio-Rad VersaDoc image analysis hardware/software package. Rac Membrane Localization—THP-1 cells (10 × 106) were plated into 6-well plates and then treated with simvastatin overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. We adapted the cellular fractionation protocol from Zhao et al. (24Zhao X. Bey E.A. Wientjes F.B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25385-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, following statin treatment for 18 h the cells were lysed by incubation in relaxation buffer (100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm EGTA, and 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.3) on ice for 15 min followed by 10 s of sonication. Cells were cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was loaded into plastic ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 1 h at 110,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman Coulter SW50.1 rotor. The resulting supernatant was removed and saved as the “cytosolic” fraction, and the membrane pellet was then resuspended in relaxation buffer. Standard Western blotting procedures were used to separate the fractions and transfer them to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes where they were probed with anti-Rac antibodies to determine the relative amount of Rac in each compartment. Membrane fractionation was assessed by stripping the blots and reprobing with the membrane marker flotillin. Band intensities were quantified using a Bio-Rad VersaDoc image analysis hardware/software package. Mean values ± S.E. were calculated, and statistical differences were determined using a one-way analysis of variance. A Tukey-Kramer post test was used to determine p values. Statin Treatment Alters Cell Morphology—We observed that BV-2 microglia exposed to statins exhibit altered cellular morphology. To explore these changes, BV-2 microglia were treated with simvastatin or lovastatin for 18 h. Following this treatment period the cells were fixed and stained with phalloidin to visualize actin filaments. At statin concentrations as low as 250 nm the BV-2 cells begin to lose their processes and become rounded (Fig. 1A). Co-treatment of BV-2 cells with simvastatin and increasing concentrations of the isoprenoid GGpp prevented the retraction of cellular processes (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that the morphological changes are due to the statin-mediated inhibition of isoprenylation. The actin-based cytoskeleton is regulated through action of the Rho family of small G-proteins and, thus, statin-mediated change in cellular morphology is likely due to the impaired Rho family function necessary to maintain cytoskeletal processes and extensions (4Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Statins Inhibit Aβ-induced Phagocytosis—The capacity of statin treatment to alter cellular morphology led us to investigate the biological effects of statins on microglial function. Exposure of microglia to fAβ results in the induction of phagocytosis through a Rac-dependent mechanism and thus should be inhibited by statin treatment through inhibition of this GTPase (20Koenigsknecht J. Landreth G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9838-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). BV-2 microglial cells were incubated with increasing concentration of statins for ∼18 h. Following pretreatment with statin, the cells were exposed to 5 μm fAβ-(1-42) or 60 μm fAβ-(25-35) for 30 min. The percentage of phagocytic cells was then determined. Both simvastatin and lovastatin reduced fAβ-(1-42)-stimulated phagocytosis to basal levels at concentrations as low as 250 nm (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were observed when Aβ-(25-35) was used to drive phagocytosis (Fig. 2, C and D). We detected inhibition of fAβ-induced phagocytosis at concentration of simvastatin as low as 100 nm (Fig. 2G). Supplementing the medium of statin-treated cells with mevalonic acid, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed the statin-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, prevention of isoprenylation with the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GTI-286 mimicked the anti-phagocytic actions of statins (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate that statins disrupt Rac function via perturbation of isoprenylation, inhibiting Aβ-stimulated phagocytosis. The statin-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis led us to directly test their effects on Rac activation in THP-1 cells. The THP-1 cells have proven valuable in examining intracellular signaling mechanisms, as they are non-adherent and thus have low background levels of integrin-mediated signaling. Rac is an important regulator of the actin-based cytoskeleton, and these non-adherent cells exhibit low basal levels of Rac activity, allowing facile detection of statin-mediated changes. We tested whether simvastatin altered GTP loading by using PAK-GST beads to isolate active, GTP-loaded Rac. THP-1 cells were treated with statins for 18 h followed by isolation of GTP-Rac. Surprisingly, we found that treatment with both simvastatin and lovastatin dramatically increased the GTP loading of Rac (Fig. 3A). Following statin treatment, Rac was observed as a doublet by Western blot. The lower mobility band corresponded to non-prenylated Rac species (25Stamatakis K. Cernuda-Morollon E. Hernandez-Perera O.

We observed a similar statin-stimulated increase in Rac GTP loading in BV-2 microglia (Fig. 3C). This response is not unique to myeloid lineage cells, as statin-induced Rac GTP loading was also detected in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 3D) and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Fig. 3E). Thus, the ability of statin treatment to provoke the conversion of Rac to its GTP-bound form is common to several cell types, including both inflammatory and non-inflammatory cell systems. In a number of experiments we found that statin treatment resulted in elevation of total cellular Rac levels, which is most evident in N2a cells. This is likely to be the result of impaired degradation of the unmodified proteins as reported by Stamatakis et al.(25Stamatakis K. Cernuda-Morollon E. Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49389-49396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We next investigated the effects of supplementing the medium with various members of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway to establish whether this effect was a consequence of the reduction of cholesterol or other intermediates in its biosynthetic pathway on statin-mediated increase in Rac GTP loading. THP-1 cells were treated with simvastatin with or without the addition of increasing concentrations of cholesterol, and the statin-induced GTP loading of Rac was found to be unchanged (Fig. 4A). Mevalonic acid supplementation of simvastatin-treated THP-1 cells was found to be associated with decreased levels of GTP-loaded Rac (Fig. 4B). Mevalonic acid supplementation also eliminated the slower migrating non-prenylated Rac species, indicating that it relieved the inhibition on isoprenylation. Adding GGpp, the isoprenoid employed for the modification of Rac (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar), to the medium of statin-treated cells prevented Rac GTP loading in response to statin treatment (Fig. 4C). Finally, prevention of GGpp isoprenylation by treatment with the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-286 increased GTP-loaded Rac, reproducing the effects of statins (Fig. 4, D and E). These data establish that statin-mediated blockade of isoprenylation paradoxically leads to increased Rac GTP loading. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the statin-mediated increase in GTP-loaded Rac, we investigated the effects of statins on the interaction between Rac and its regulator RhoGDI. Rho family G-proteins such as Rac are subject to negative regulation by the cytosolic inhibitory protein RhoGDI (28Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Under resting conditions, GDP-loaded Rac localized in the cytosol bound to RhoGDI, which prevents GDP dissociation and therefore suppresses activity. Upon stimulation the Rac-RhoGDI complex dissociates, allowing Rac to interact with its guanine nucleotide exchange factors, become GTP-loaded (active), and translocate to the plasma membrane to interact with its effectors. Importantly, the interaction between Rac and RhoGDI is mediated by both protein-protein interactions and protein-lipid interactions (29Lian L.Y. Barsukov I. Golovanov A.P. Hawkins D.I. Badii R. Sze K.H. Keep N.H. Bokoch G.M. Roberts G.C. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The C-terminal geranylgeranyl isoprenyl moiety of Rac binds to a hydrophobic region on RhoGDI, and lack of the isoprenyl modification prevents this interaction (30Di-Poi N. Faure J. Grizot S. Molnar G. Pick E. Dagher M.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10014-10022Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that statin prevention of Rac isoprenylation would disrupt the interaction with RhoGDI and account for the enhanced GTP loading. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring the interaction between Rac and RhoGDI. Following 18 h of statin treatment, RhoGDI was immunoprecipitated from THP-1 cells, and the resulting Western blots were probed with anti-Rac antibodies. Statin treatment inhibited the association of Rac with RhoGDI (Fig. 5). This result is representative of three independent experiments that, on average, lowered the amount of Rac isolated in with RhoGDI by at least 40%. We used a biochemical fractionation protocol to investigate the effect statin-mediated prevention of isoprenylation would have on subcellular localization of Rac. Following an 18-h statin treatment, cellular lysates from THP-1 cells were fractionated into membrane and cytosolic fractions and probed for Rac. We observed that statin treatment decreased the amount of Rac associated with the membrane (Fig. 6). In three independent experiments the average reduction of Rac in the membrane fractions was >50%. Cytosolic levels of Rac were not detectably altered because of proportionally larger amounts of Rac in this fraction. The primary action of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, which leads to reduction of plasma cholesterol levels (1Tobert J.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Recently these compounds have been shown to have pleiotropic effects that are unrelated to cholesterol reduction (2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 45: 89-118Crossref Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Specifically, statins have been shown to have robust anti-inflammatory actions. These effects have been attributed to the prevention of isoprenylation and the subsequent disruption of small G-protein functions (2Liao J.K. Laufs U. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 45: 89-118Crossref Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Although the pleiotropic effects of statins have been demonstrated to include attenuation of inflammation in the vasculature, their mechanisms of action in the central nervous system are just beginning to be explored (2Liao J.K.

In a recent study, we have shown that knockdown of HDAC6 by a specific small interfering RNA leads to hyperacetylation of hsp90 and that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), an established hsp90 “client” protein, is defective in ligand binding, nuclear translocation, and gene activation in HDAC6-deficient cells (Kovacs, J. J., Murphy, P. J. M., Gaillard, S., Zhao, X., Wu, J-T., Nicchitta, C. V., Yoshida, M., Toft, D. O., Pratt, W. B., and Yao, T-P. (2005) Mol. Cell 18, 601–607). Using human embryonic kidney wild-type and HDAC6 (small interfering RNA) knockdown cells transiently expressing the mouse GR, we show here that the intrinsic properties of the receptor protein itself are not affected by HDAC6 knockdown, but the knockdown cytosol has a markedly decreased ability to assemble stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and generate stable steroid binding activity under cell-free conditions. HDAC6 knockdown cytosol has the same ability to carry out dynamic GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly as wild-type cytosol. Addition of purified hsp90 to HDAC6 knockdown cytosol restores stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly to the level of wild-type cytosol. hsp90 from HDAC6 knockdown cytosol has decreased ATP-binding affinity, and it does not assemble stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes when it is a component of a purified five-protein assembly system. Incubation of knockdown cell hsp90 with purified HDAC6 converts the hsp90 to wild-type behavior. Thus, acetylation of hsp90 results in dynamic GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly/disassembly, and this is manifest in the cell as a ∼100-fold shift to the right in the steroid dose response for gene activation.

The hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery regulates a wide variety of proteins involved in cellular signaling through the assembly of client protein·hsp90 heterocomplexes (reviewed in Ref. 1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The chaperones hsp90 and hsp70 play a key role in the balance between maintenance of protein integrity and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, and inhibition of hsp90 function leads to degradation of hsp90 client proteins (2Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E. Ouerfelli O. Danishefsky S. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14536-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 3Isaacs J.S. Xu W.

This suggests that hsp90 function is affected by acetylation/deacetylation.

Nature. 2002; 417: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar) and has been shown to regulate aggresome formation in response to misfolded protein stress (8Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T-P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conducting regulator (CFTR) is a client protein of hsp90 (9Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and a mutant form, CFTR-Δ508, is prone to misfolding and aggresome formation (reviewed in Ref. 10Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Misfolded CFTR-Δ508 moves in a dynein-dependent fashion along microtubules to form the perinuclear aggresome (10Kopito R.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 524-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). HDAC6 is a component of these aggresomes and cells deficient in HDAC6 cannot form aggresomes properly, apparently because of a failure to load polyubiquitinated misfolded protein onto the dynein motor for transport to aggresomes (8Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T-P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitylated CFTR-Δ508 is coimmunoadsorbed from cytosol with HDAC6 and HDAC6 is coadsorbed with dynein, it was proposed that HDAC6 directly links ubiquitylated CFTR-Δ508 to the motor protein (8Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T-P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Other hsp90 client proteins, such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (11Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J.M. Morishima Y. Chen H. Mansfield J.F. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

In this movement system, client protein·hsp90 heterocomplexes formed by the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery are linked via hsp90-binding immunophilins to the dynein/dynactin motor protein complex (Refs. 11Harrell J.M.

Signal. 2004; 16: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Because HDAC6 could be required for proper hsp90 function in forming these movement complexes rather than acting itself to directly link the client protein to the dynein motor, we have examined the effect of HDAC6 on hsp90 acetylation and function (15Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J-T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). We showed that HDAC6 binds hsp90 in vivo and that purified HDAC6 deacetylates hsp90 in vitro (15Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J-T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A or knockdown (KD) of HDAC6 by specific small interfering RNA leads to hyperacetylation of hsp90, and hsp90 in cytosol of HDAC6 knockdown cells has much less of the hsp90 cochaperone p23 bound to it than the hsp90 in wild-type cytosol (15Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J-T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The GR in HDAC6-deficient cells is defective in ligand binding, nuclear translocation, and gene activation, suggesting that HDAC6 is required for hsp90 function in vivo (15Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M.

Although we proposed that HDAC6 activity is critical for normal GR function, it was not determined that hsp90, rather than the GR itself, p23, or another component of the hsp90/hsp70-based chaperone machinery, was the critical target of HDAC6 action. In this work, we have examined the role of HDAC6 on GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly and steroid binding activity in vitro. We show that cytosol from HDAC6 knockdown cells has a decreased ability to assemble stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and that the assembly activity can be restored to the level of wild-type cytosol by addition of purified deacetylated hsp90. The stable heterocomplex assembly activity of hsp90 purified from HDAC6 knockdown cytosol can be functionally restored by incubating it with purified HDAC6. Interestingly, despite its deficiency in stable heterocomplex assembly, the acetylated hsp90 of HDAC6 knockdown cells is still able to carry out dynamic assembly of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. The acetylated hsp90 has a lower affinity for ATP than the wild-type hsp90, and the dynamic GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly/disassembly that occurs in HDAC6 knockdown cells is manifest as a ∼100-fold shift to the right versus wild-type cells in the dose response of dexamethasone for transcriptional activation. Together with our previous report (15Kovacs J.J. Murphy P.J.M. Gaillard S. Zhao X. Wu J-T. Nicchitta C.V. Yoshida M. Toft D.O. Pratt W.B. Yao T.P. Mol.

The expression plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG-tagged HDAC6 and rabbit antisera used to immunoblot HDAC6 (α-HDAC6) and acetylated lysine (α-AcK) were generated in the Yao laboratory and have been described (7Hubbert C.

Cell Culture and Cytosol Preparation—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Cells were harvested by scraping into Hanks' buffered saline solution and centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution, resuspended in 1.5 volumes of HEM buffer (10 mm NaOH-Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm sodium molybdate, pH 7.4) with 1 μm trichostatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 tablet of Complete-Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 3 ml buffer, and ruptured by Dounce homogenization. The lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant, referred to as “cytosol,” was collected, aliquotted, flash-frozen, and stored at –70 °C. Mouse GR was expressed in Sf9 cells, and cytosol was prepared as described previously (16Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Li D.P. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18054-18060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of Mouse GR and MMTV-CAT Reporter—293T cells were grown as monolayer cultures in 162-cm2 culture flasks to ∼50% confluency, washed, and incubated with 5 ml of serum-free medium containing 25 μg of plasmid DNA and 75 μl of TransFast transfection reagent (Promega). After 1 h, 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine calf serum was added, and the incubations were continued for 48 h. For transfection of MMTV-CAT reporter, wild-type and knockdown cells were grown as monolayer cultures in 35-mm culture wells to ∼50% confluency, washed, and incubated for 1 h with 1 ml of serum-free medium containing 5 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of TransFast transfection reagent. The transfection medium was replaced with regular medium, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. During the incubation, cells were treated for 20 h with various concentrations of dexamethasone. Immunoadsorption of GR—Receptors were immunoadsorbed from aliquots of 50 μl (for measuring steroid binding) or 100 μl (for Western blotting) of Sf9 cell cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4°C with 18 μl of protein A-Sepharose precoupled to 10 μl of FiGR ascites suspended in 200 μl of TEG (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Immunoadsorbed GR was stripped of endogenously associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet for an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 350 μl of 0.5 m NaCl in TEG buffer. The pellets were then washed once with 1 ml of TEG buffer followed by a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). GR·hsp90 Heterocomplex Reconstitution—Immunopellets containing GR stripped of chaperones were incubated with 50 μl of reticulocyte lysate or 293T cell cytosol and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). For heterocomplex reconstitution with purified proteins, immunopellets containing stripped GR were incubated with 15 μg of ATP-agarose-purified knockdown or wild-type HEK 293 hsp90, 15 μg of purified rabbit hsp70, 0.6 μg of purified human Hop, 6 μg of purified human p23, 0.125 μg of purified YDJ-1 adjusted to 55 μl with HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 5 μl of the ATP-regenerating system. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with suspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 2 min. At the end of the incubation, the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold TEGM buffer (TEG with 20 mm sodium molybdate) and assayed for steroid binding capacity and for GR-associated hsp90. In the experiments shown in Fig. 7, the five-protein mixture containing purified knockdown hsp90 was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with an α-FLAG immune pellet prepared from cytosols of control or FLAG-tagged HDAC6-expressing cells prior to addition of the mixture to stripped GR immune pellets for heterocomplex reconstitution for 20 min at 30 °C. Assay of Steroid Binding Capacity—For cytosols to be assayed for steroid binding, a 50-μl aliquot of cytosol was incubated overnight at 4°Cin50 μl of HEM buffer plus 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone ± a 1,000-fold excess of non-radioactive dexamethasone. Samples were mixed with dextran-coated charcoal, centrifuged, and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/100 μl of cytosol. Washed immune pellets to be assayed for steroid binding to stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50 μl of HEM buffer plus 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone. Samples were then washed three times with 1 ml of TEGM buffer and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. For assay of steroid binding under dynamic GR·hsp90 assembly conditions, 50 nm [3H]dexamethasone was present during the assembly incubation at 30 °C, and pellets were then washed and counted. In both cases, the steroid binding is expressed as counts/min of [3H]dexamethasone bound/FiGR immunopellet prepared from 100 μl of Sf9 cell cytosol. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Immune pellets were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with 0.25 μg/ml BuGR2 for GR, 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90, 1 μg/ml JJ3 for p23, 0.1% α-AcK, or 0.1% α-HDAC6. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with the appropriate 125I-conjugated or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated counter-antibody to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Protein Purification—hsp70, Hop, YDJ-1 (the yeast homolog of hsp40), and p23 were purified as described by Kanelakis and Pratt (17Kanelakis K.C. Pratt W.B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When hsp90 was purified from HDAC6 knockdown cells by our usual three-step procedure (17Kanelakis K.C. Pratt W.B. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 364: 159-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it was deacetylated and functionally identical to purified wild-type hsp90 in supporting stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly in the five-protein assembly system. Because hsp90 binds to ATP-agarose when the salt concentration of the application buffer is low and can then be eluted with a salt gradient, we used a single-step procedure of ATP-agarose chromatography both to partially purify hsp90 and to compare the relative ATP-binding properties of hsp90 from knockdown and wild-type cells. This procedure rapidly separates hsp90 from deacetylating activity and yields acetylated hsp90 from knockdown cytosol that does not support stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly (Fig. 6). For ATP affinity chromatography, 2.0 ml of cytosol prepared in HEM buffer was applied to a 50-ml column of ATP-agarose, the column was washed with 100 ml of HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA), and the column was then eluted with a 125-ml gradient of (0–500 mm) KCl in HE buffer. hsp90 was eluted with the KCl gradient, and the matrix was subsequently cleared of hsp70 and other high affinity ATP-binding proteins by elution with 5 mm ATP. The hsp90-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting, pooled, and contracted to 200–250 μ by Amicon filtration. It is important to freeze the preparation in multiple small aliquots and to unfreeze them only once. GR-mediated Transcriptional Activation—Dexamethasone-induced CAT gene expression was assayed by measuring CAT enzymatic activity in wild-type and knockdown cell cytosol, using a modified version of the CAT assay described in Kwok et al. (18Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with MMTV-CAT reporter and treated for 20 h with various concentrations of dexamethasone were washed, harvested, resuspended in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8), and ruptured by exposing the cell suspensions to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatants was measured by Bradford assay. Aliquots of the supernatants containing 10 μg of total protein were incubated for 15 min at 70 °C in 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The aliquots were added to a CAT reaction mixture (50 nm purified [3H]chloramphenicol, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 mm butyryl-CoA) and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. An organic phase mixture consisting of 2 parts pristane and 1 part mixed xylenes was added, and the samples were thoroughly vortexed. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and 150 μl of the organic phase was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. hsp90 Binding to GR and Steroid Binding Activity Are Decreased in HDAC6 Knockdown Cells—FK228, an inhibitor of multiple histone deacetylases, has been reported to deplete cells of several hsp90 client proteins (e.g. p53, ErbB2, Raf-1) (4Yu X. Guo Z.S. Marcu M.G. Neckers L. Nguyen D.M. Chen G.A. Schrump D.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2002; 94: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, selective knockdown of HDAC6 in HEK 293T cells results in decreased glucocorticoid binding activity without any decrease in the level of endogenous human GR (Fig. 1A). To further examine the effect of HDAC6 knockdown, we wanted to immunoadsorb the GR and directly examine its activity in formation of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. Because we were unable to find an immunoadsorbing antibody against the human GR, we transiently expressed the mouse (m) GR in HEK cells. Again, we found decreased steroid binding activity in HDAC6 knockdown cells without any decrease in the level of expressed mGR (Fig. 1B). mGR was immunoadsorbed from both wild-type and HDAC6 knockdown cells, and the immune pellets were immunoblotted to detect coadsorbed hsp90 and p23. As shown in Fig. 1C, there is very little hsp90 or p23 in mGR immune pellets from knockdown cells compared with wild-type cells. The GR in HDAC6 Knockdown Cells Has Normal Ability to Form Complexes with hsp90—The cochaperone p23 stabilizes GR·hsp90 complexes, both in cell-free assembly (19Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and in vivo (20Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J.M. Lowe E.R. Jenkins G.J. Osawa Y. Sunahara R.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48754-48763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that acetylation of p23 or of the GR itself could account for decreased steroid binding activity and decreased recovery of GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes from HDAC6 knockdown cells. However, we did not detect any acetylation of either the mGR or p23 immunoadsorbed from knockdown cells under conditions where acetylation of knockdown hsp90 could be visualized (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the mGR from HDAC6 knockdown cells could form stable GR·hsp90 complexes, the mGR was incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate. As shown in Fig. 2B, the mGR from knockdown cells had the same ability to form mGR·rabbit hsp90 heterocomplexes with the same steroid binding activity as mGR from wild-type cells. Thus, the mGR from HDAC6 knockdown cells appears to be intrinsically normal and competent to become a functional receptor in the presence of wild-type hsp90 chaperone machinery. HDAC6 Knockdown Cytosol Is Deficient at Stable GR·hsp90 Heterocomplex Assembly—To determine whether HDAC6 knockdown cells were deficient at GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, baculovirus-expressed mGR was immunoadsorbed from Sf9 cytosol, stripped of insect chaperones, and incubated with cytosols prepared from wild-type and knockdown cells. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that cytosol from HDAC6 knockdown cells has a reduced ability to form GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes and generate steroid binding activity. In all cases where client proteins form heterocomplexes with hsp90 that are stable enough to survive immunoadsorption and washing, inhibition of hsp90 function (e.g. by geldanamycin) leads to degradation via the ubiquitylation/proteasome pathway (3Isaacs J.S. Xu W. Neckers L. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). This is the case for the GR (21Whitesell L. Cook P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and it is surprising that the level of GR in HDAC6 knockdown cells is the same as that in wild-type cells (Fig. 1), despite the reduced ability of knockdown cells to form GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. However, in some cases, hsp90 client proteins engage in a very dynamic cycle of heterocomplex assembly/disassembly, with disassembly being so rapid that no, or only trace amounts of, client protein·hsp90 heterocomplexes are observed with biochemical techniques. This is the case with neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, for example, which associates with hsp90 in a very dynamic manner that is sort of a “hit-and-run” mode of hsp90 regulation (22Billecke S.S. Draganov D.I. Morishima Y. Murphy P.J.M. Dunbar A.Y. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30252-30258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, such a dynamic cycle of heterocomplex assembly/disassembly nevertheless stabilizes neuronal nitric-oxide synthase to proteasomal degradation (23Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M. Demady D.R. Kanelakis K.C. Noguchi S. Pratt W.B. Osawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1472-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The GR undergoes a similar dynamic cycle of hsp90 heterocomplex assembly/disassembly in vitro when p23 is omitted from the purified assembly system (19Dittmar K.D. Demady D.R. Stancato L.F. Krishna P. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Such a dynamic assembly cycle can be detected by having radiolabeled dexamethasone present during the assembly incubation (24Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The [3H]dexamethasone binds to the receptor as GR·hsp90 complexes are formed, thus steroid binding constitutes evidence that the chaperone machinery has carried out hsp90-dependent opening of the steroid binding cleft. In Fig. 4, replicate GR immune pellets were incubated with cytosols from wild-type and HDAC6 knockdown 293T cells in the absence of dexamethasone and then washed and incubated with [3H]dexamethasone to detect stable heterocomplex assembly (Fig. 4A), or they were incubated with cytosols in the presence of [3H]dexamethasone to detect dynamic heterocomplex assembly (Fig. 4B). Although the HDAC6 knockdown cytosol is deficient at stable GR·hsp90 heterocomplex assembly, it has the same activity as wild-type cytosol at dynamic heterocomplex assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2018523450,"Peroxisomes are dynamic organelles that often proliferate in response to compounds that they metabolize. Peroxisomes can proliferate by two apparent mechanisms, division of preexisting peroxisomes and de novo synthesis of peroxisomes. Evidence for de novo peroxisome synthesis comes from studies of cells lacking the peroxisomal integral membrane peroxin Pex3p. These cells lack peroxisomes, but peroxisomes can assemble upon reintroduction of Pex3p. The source of these peroxisomes has been the subject of debate. Here, we show that the amino-terminal 46 amino acids of Pex3p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae target to a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum and initiate the formation of a preperoxisomal compartment for de novo peroxisome synthesis. In vivo video microscopy showed that this preperoxisomal compartment can import both peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins leading to the formation of bona fide peroxisomes through the continued activity of full-length Pex3p. Peroxisome formation from the preperoxisomal compartment depends on the activity of the genes PEX14 and PEX19, which are required for the targeting of peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins, respectively.

Our findings support a direct role for the endoplasmic reticulum in de novo peroxisome formation. A characteristic of eukaryotic cells is the presence of seemingly distinct subcellular compartments or organelles possessing specific sets of proteins required for specialized cellular functions. However, organelles do not exist in isolation, and interorganellar communication through the movement and exchange of different molecules is required for normal cell function. This interdependence of organelles extends beyond their biochemical and metabolic roles and necessitates that their biogenesis and turnover also be coordinated. The peroxisome has long been considered an autonomous organelle that proliferates by the growth and division of preexisting peroxisomes (1Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and is inherited as a functional organelle at cell division. But what of the concept of de novo peroxisome biogenesis? From an evolutionary point of view, peroxisome proliferation and inheritance could have evolved as a response to a slow and perhaps unreliable mechanism of de novo peroxisome biogenesis. However, de novo peroxisome biogenesis, when combined with peroxisome growth, division, and inheritance, would provide the cell with a fail-safe system for peroxisome maintenance and ultimately for its survival. Evidence implicating the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; PTS, peroxisome targeting signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CSM, complete supplement mixture; RIM, raffinose induction medium; GIM, galactose induction medium. in peroxisome biogenesis has accumulated in recent years (reviewed in Refs. 2Tabak H.F.

The amino-terminal 16 amino acids of the peroxisomal integral membrane protein Pex3p of Hansenula polymorpha were shown to be sufficient to target a reporter protein to the ER (5Baerends R.J.

Harder W. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, the peroxisomal membrane proteins Pex2p and Pex16p were shown to traffic through the ER and to acquire core N-linked glycosylation (7Titorenko V.I. Ogrydziak D.M. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5210-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Findings supporting de novo peroxisome biogenesis in close association with the ER were obtained in cells of Y. lipolytica temperature-sensitive for Pex3p function (8Bascom R.A. Chan H. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 939-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and studies in the plant Arabidopsis showed that peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase localized to a subdomain of rough ER that could serve as a compartment for posttranslational sorting to peroxisomes (9Lisenbee C.S. Heinze M. Trelease R.N. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 870-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In mouse dendritic cells, the peroxisomal membrane proteins Pex13p and PMP70 were found in subdomains of the ER that extended to a peroxisomal reticulum from which mature peroxisome arose (10Geuze H.J. Murk J.L. Stroobants A.K. Griffith J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Koster A.J. Verkleij A.J. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2900-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Little is known about the very early events of peroxisome biogenesis, particularly the formation of the peroxisome membrane. Only Pex3p, Pex16p, and Pex19p have been shown to have specific roles in biogenesis of the peroxisome membrane. Human cells lacking any of these peroxins contain neither peroxisomes nor peroxisome remnants (11Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K. Wanders R.J. Suzuki Y. Kondo N.

Here, we report the results of studies linking the ER to de novo peroxisome formation in S. cerevisiae and show using in vivo video microscopy that the amino-terminal 46 amino acids of the peroxin Pex3p initiate the formation of a peroxisomal precursor from the ER membrane from which bona fide peroxisomes can form.

Suprapto A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1465-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Microscopy—Strains synthesizing GFP+ and/or mRFP chimeras were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic minimal medium and then incubated in YPBO medium for 8 h or SCIM for 16 h. For raffinose/galactose induction, diploid cells grown overnight in YPR medium were incubated in RIM for 16 h and then transferred to GIM. Images were captured on a LSM510 META (Carl Zeiss) laser scanning microscope or on an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a digital fluorescence camera (Spot Diagnostic Instruments). Cells were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy (26Tam Y.Y.C. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2681-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and electron microscopy (27Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Four-dimensional in Vivo Video Microscopy—Cells grown in YPR medium and then incubated in RIM for 16 h were prepared for four-dimensional in vivo video microscopy by placing 1-2 μl of culture on a slide with a thin agarose pad containing 2% galactose, which was covered with a coverslip and sealed with petroleum jelly (28Adames N.R. Oberle J.R. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated at room temperature for image capture. Images were captured using a modified LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 1.4 normal aperture Plan-Apo objective (Carl Zeiss) (29Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 935-940PubMed Google Scholar). A piezoelectric actuator was used to drive continuous objective movement, allowing for rapid collection of z-stacks. A side of each pixel represented 0.085 μm of sample. Stacks of eight optical sections spaced 0.45 μm apart were captured every 60 s. GFP was excited using a 488-nm laser, and its emission was collected using a 505-530-nm band-pass filter. mRFP was excited using a 543-nm laser, and its emission was collected using a 600-nm long-pass filter. Images were filtered three times using a 3×3 hybrid median filter to reduce shot noise. Fluorescence images from each stack were projected using an average intensity algorithm that involved multiplication of each pixel value by an appropriate enhancement factor for better contrast. Correction for exponential photobleaching of GFP and mRFP was performed by exponentially increasing the enhancement factor with each projection. The transmitted light images from each stack were projected using a maximum intensity algorithm. These operations were performed using NIH Image (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Adobe Photoshop was used to merge fluorescent and transmitted light projections. Antibodies—Antibodies to amino acids 43-440 of Pex3p and to GFP were raised in rabbit and guinea pig. Antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal SKL tripeptide (30Aitchison J.D. Szilard R.K. Nuttley W.M. Rachubinski R.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 721-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to peroxisomal thiolase (31Eitzen G.A. Titorenko V.I. Smith J.J. Veenhuis M. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol.

Rabbit antibodies to S. cerevisiae glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used to detect primary antibodies in immunoblot analysis. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used to detect primary antibodies in immunofluorescence microscopy. Analytical Procedures—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (22Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J. Dilworth D.J. Ideker T. Galitski T. Dimitrov K. Rachubinski R.A. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (27Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes in immunoblots were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Truncated Pex3p Proteins Reveal Peroxisomal Localization Information for Pex3p and the Presence of an Unknown Compartment—Pex3p and Pex19p act early in the biogenesis of peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae as cells lacking either peroxin do not contain peroxisomes, and peroxisomes can be observed to form upon their reintroduction. Pex3p is reported to be the docking factor for Pex19p on the peroxisomal membrane (32Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This observation places the function of Pex3p in peroxisome biogenesis ahead of that of Pex19p; therefore, Pex3p serves as the best candidate protein with which to study the early events of peroxisome biogenesis. Genes encoding GFP fused to the amino-terminal 20 (20aa-GFP) or 46 (46aa-GFP) amino acids of Pex3p or to full-length Pex3p (Pex3p-GFP) were expressed under the control of the native PEX3 promoter from plasmid in the parental haploid strain BY4741 and in the peroxisome-deficient strains pex3Δ and pex19Δ. pmRFP-PTS1 was cotransformed into the various strains to fluorescently label peroxisomes, and cells were grown in oleic acid medium and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A). Pex3p-GFP was able to target to peroxisomes in BY4741 and pex3Δ cells, as shown by the colocalization of GFP and mRFP signals in punctate structures. However, in pex19Δ cells, Pex3p-GFP was targeted to punctate structures that did not fluorescently label with mRFP-PTS1 (which labeled the cytosol) and therefore do not correspond to peroxisomes, confirming that the formation of peroxisomes requires a copy of PEX19. The 20aa-GFP chimera localized to the cytosol of cells of all strains despite the fact that BY4741 cells contain peroxisomes. pex3Δ cells expressing 20aa-GFP were unable to form peroxisomes, suggesting that the information for the formation of peroxisomes is not encompassed by the first 20 amino acids of Pex3p. 46aa-GFP was targeted to peroxisomes in BY4741 cells. Because 20aa-GFP was unable to target to peroxisomes, the peroxisome targeting signal (PTS) of Pex3p must extend to between amino acids 21 and 46. Interestingly, in pex3Δ and pex19Δ cells, 46aa-GFP localized to an unknown compartment represented by one or two small punctate fluorescent structures. These structures were not peroxisomes, as they did not label with mRFP-PTS1, which mislocalized to the cytosol. The capacity of 46aa-GFP to be targeted to peroxisomes in BY4741 cells that contain peroxisomes and to an unknown compartment in pex3Δ and pex19Δ cells that lack peroxisomes suggested that this unknown compartment might serve as a preperoxisomal compartment from which peroxisomes could form upon provision of cells with full-length Pex3p. Targeting of 46aa-GFP to the unknown compartment is independent of Pex19p, consistent with a previous report that Pex19p is not required to target Pex3p to peroxisomes (32Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To avoid possible artifacts of gene overexpression from multicopy plasmids, genomically encoded GFP chimeras of Pex3p (gPex3p-GFP) and the amino-terminal 46 amino acids of Pex3p (g46aa-GFP) were constructed. As observed with construct expression from plasmid (Fig. 1A), epifluorescence analysis of oleic acid-incubated cells showed that gPex3p-GFP localized to punctate structures with the characteristics of peroxisomes, whereas g46aa-GFP localized to an unknown compartment that presented usually as one or two fluorescent dots (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence analysis of oleic acid-incubated cells with antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal PTS1 tripeptide Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL) or to the PTS2-containing enzyme Pot1p (thiolase) showed that cells expressing gPex3p-GFP contained peroxisomes having both Pot1p- and PTS1-containing proteins, as observed for parental BY4741 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cells expressing g46aa-GFP showed a cytosolic location for both Pot1p- and PTS1-containing proteins, as in pex3Δ cells, consistent with the absence of peroxisomes in both cell types (Fig. 1C). The functionality of the GFP chimeras was determined by growing cells on agar medium containing oleic acid as the sole carbon source, the metabolism of which requires functional peroxisomes. Cells expressing Pex3p-GFP grew at a rate similar to that of BY4741 cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that gPex3p-GFP functions like wild-type Pex3p. As expected, pex3Δ cells failed to grow. Cells expressing g46aa-GFP grew poorly or not at all, indicating that peroxisomal function is compromised in these cells. In electron micrographs, peroxisomes of BY4741 cells incubated in oleic acid-containing medium appeared as typical round vesicular structures, 0.1-0.5 μm in diameter, surrounded by a single unit membrane and containing a homogenous granular matrix (Fig. 1E) (22Smith J.J. Marelli M. Christmas R.H. Vizeacoumar F.J. Dilworth D.J. Ideker T. Galitski T. Dimitrov K. Rachubinski R.A. Aitchison J.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 259-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26Tam Y.Y.C. Rachubinski R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2681-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Eitzen G.A. Szilard R.K. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, pex3Δ cells and cells expressing g46aa-GFP lacked identifiable peroxisomes. The Amino Terminus of Pex3p Targets a Subdomain of the ER—Because cells expressing g46aa-GFP do not contain peroxisomes (Fig. 1C), we attempted to define the subcellular compartment containing the chimera by performing colocalization analyses of g46aa-GFP with known organellar markers. g46aa-GFP did not colocalize with mitochondria marked with MitoTracker dye but showed an almost absolute colocalization with a genomically encoded fluorescent chimera (gKar2p-mRFP-HDEL) of the ER-resident chaperone, Kar2p (Fig. 2A). In 100 cells, 81.5% of g46aa-GFP-containing structures colocalized with gKar2p-mRFP-HDEL (TABLE TWO). Subcellular fractionation also supported localization of g46aa-GFP to the ER compartment (Fig. 2B). Pex3p in BY4741 cells localized mainly to the 20KgP fraction enriched for heavy organelles, including peroxisomes. Kar2p also localized preferentially to the 20KgP fraction, but a substantial fraction of Kar2p was also detected in the 20KgS fraction enriched for cytosol and lighter organelles. g46aa-GFP localized almost exclusively to the 20KgS fraction. Upon ultracentrifugation of the 20KgS fraction, g46aa-GFP cofractionated to both the 250KgS and 250KgP fractions in a manner almost identical to that of Kar2p, consistent with a colocalization of g46aa-GFP and that portion of Kar2p initially found in the 20KgS fraction. Together these results suggest that the previously unknown compartment to which g46aa-GFP targets is a subdomain of the ER.TABLE TWOQuantiative analysis of GFP structures in various strains Strains Number of punctate GFP structures in 100 cells Number of punctate GFP structures colocalizing with gKar2p-mRFP-HDEL 46aa-GFP/KAR2-mRFP-HDEL 157 128 KAR2-mRFP-HDEL 0 NAaNA, not applicable. 46aa-GFP 161 NA 20aa-GFP 0 NA 20aa-GFP/KAR2-mRFP-HDEL 0 0a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab Peroxisomes Form from the Compartment Targeted by the Amino Terminus of Pex3p—Might the g46aa-GFP-containing compartment be a preperoxisomal compartment? To investigate the dynamics of this compartment upon synthesis of full-length Pex3p, haploid cells expressing g46aa-GFP were mated to haploid cells expressing Pex3p under the control of a genomically integrated galactose-inducible promoter (GAL1), and the diploid cells were analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. The diploid strains also expressed one of the fluorescently labeled versions of the peroxisomal matrix enzymes Pot1p (Pot1p-mRFP) and Fox2p (Fox2p-mRFP-SKL) or Pex3p-mRFP (under control of the GAL1 promoter). Cells were grown in raffinose/oleic acid medium (RIM) and transferred to galactose/oleic acid medium (GIM). Fluorescence images were taken at various times after transfer to GIM (Fig. 3A). At 0 h, both matrix enzymes were localized to the cytosol, and no signal for Pex3p-mRFP was observed. With increased synthesis of Pex3p-mRFP at later times, Pex3p-mRFP appeared in and colocalized with the punctate structures labeled by g46aa-GFP. Upon induction of Pex3p, both Pot1p-mRFP and Fox2p-mRFP-SKL also targeted to the g46aa-GFP-labeled structures. Electron micrographs of the diploid strain B59P showed no recognizable peroxisomal structures at 0 h but showed characteristic peroxisomes at 6 h after transfer to GIM (Fig. 3B). It is noteworthy that cells showed peroxisome clustering after being incubated in GIM for more than 4 h (Fig. 3, A and B), possibly because of high levels of synthesis of Pex3p (Fig. 3C). In contrast, during incubation in GIM, the levels of g46aa-GFP decreased over time, suggesting that galactose inhibits the normal induction pattern observed for Pex3p in oleic acid-containing medium. Four-dimensional in vivo video microscopy has proven a valuable tool with which to study the dynamics of cellular processes. It has recently been used to observe the de novo formation of transitional ER sites and Golgi structures (33Bevis B.J. Hammond A.T. Reinke C.A. Glick B.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We used four-dimensional in vivo video microscopy to visualize the dynamics of the g46aa-GFP compartment and the formation of peroxisomes. Diploid B5P3 and B59P cells were grown in RIM, transferred to GIM for 1.5 h, and then spotted onto an agarose pad containing oleic acid and a small quantity of glucose (SCIM) and galactose. Diploid B5P3 cells (Fig. 3A), which express the gene for Pex3p-mRFP from one PEX3 locus under the control of the GAL1 promoter, showed the synthesis and import of Pex3p-mRFP into g46aa-GFP-labeled structures (Fig. 4A and supplemental video 1). In contrast, diploid B59P cells, which express wild-type Pex3p from one PEX3 locus under the control of the GAL1 promoter, showed the import of gPot1p-mRFP from the cytosol into the g46aa-GFP-labeled compartment (Fig. 4B and supplemental video 2). These results suggest that the amino-terminal 46 amino acids of Pex3p contain sufficient information to target to a preperoxisome compartment but insufficient information to drive the formation of peroxisomes. Only in the presence of full-length Pex3p, which is initially targeted to the same compartment as the g46aa-GFP, can peroxisomes form. Transit of Pex3p through the ER en route to peroxisomes has not been observed in wild-type cells, perhaps because of the predominance of peroxisome division over peroxisome de novo formation or because the transit of Pex3p through the ER is so rapid that microscopy is unable to capture the event. Expression of the g46aa-GFP construct might delay the exit of the peroxisomal precursor from the ER compartment, as it lacks those sequences of Pex3p downstream of the first amino-terminal amino acids responsible for this process. As we have observed, expression of full-length Pex3p together with g46aa-GFP led to the formation of bona fide peroxisomes capable of peroxisomal matrix and membrane protein import from the cytosol (Figs. 3A and 4), consistent with information for the exit of the peroxisomal precursor from the ER being provided by sequences of the Pex3p carboxyl-terminal to its first 46 amino acids. It should be noted that some mother cells expressing g46aa-GFP and full-length Pex3p appeared to be devoid of peroxisomes (Fig. 4). However, peroxisomes capable of importing matrix (gPot1p-mRFP) and membrane (gPex3p-mRFP) proteins were observed in mother cells after prolonged periods of incubation. We did not observe the reappearance of typical g46aa-GFP-labeled structures in these cells, possibly because of rapid photobleaching of newly synthesized GFP. Peroxisome Formation from the Preperoxisomal Compartment Requires Pex14p and Pex19p—Both Pex14p and Pex19p are required for peroxisome assembly. Pex14p is the point of convergence of the PTS1 and PTS2 matrix protein import pathways (34Albertini M. Rehling P. Erdmann R. Girzalsky W. Kiel J.A. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Pex19p is required for stability in and/or targeting to the peroxisomal membrane for most peroxisomal membrane proteins (14Sacksteder K.A. Jones J.M. South S.T. Li X. Liu Y. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 35Hettema E.H. Girzalsky W. van den B.M. Erdmann R. Distel B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated what roles Pex14p and Pex19p might have in regulating the dynamics of the g46aa-GFP-labeled compartment. Cells lacking Pex14p or Pex19p were grown in RIM and then transferred to GIM, and aliquots of cells were taken at various times after transfer. The fluorescence signals for g46aa-GFP, Pot1p-mRFP, and Pex3p-mRFP were analyzed (Fig. 5). Cells deleted for either PEX14 or PEX19 showed colocalization of g46aa-GFP with Pex3p-mRFP when shifted to GIM, and the synthesis of Pex3p-mRFP was turned on. However, Pot1p-mRFP remained mostly cytosolic and was not targeted to g46aa-GFP-labeled structures. Therefore, both PEX14 and PEX19 are required for the development of g46aa-GFP-labeled structures into peroxisomes. This study shows that the amino terminus of Pex3p targets to peroxisomes in wild-type cells and a subdomain of the ER in cells lacking peroxisomes. This subdomain of the ER can develop into functional peroxisomes through the activity of full-length Pex3p. Immunoelectron microscopy of mouse dendritic cells has shown that the peroxisomal membrane protein Pex13p can be found in a specialized ER subdomain (10Geuze H.J. Murk J.L. Stroobants A.K. Griffith J.M. Kleijmeer M.J. Koster A.J. Verkleij A.J. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2900-2907Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional image reconstruction demonstrated continuity between this specialized ER subdomain and a reticular structure resembling peroxisomes. These results suggest a peroxisome maturation pathway initiating at the ER. However, a peroxisomal reticulum has not been observed in yeasts. We were unable to observe any unique membranous structure in electron micrographs that might correspond to the punctate structure targeted by g46aa-GFP. This is not surprising given that that the preperoxisomal vesicles of Y. lipolytica have a rather routine appearance that does not distinguish them from the overall population of vesicles in the cell (36Titorenko V.I. Chan H. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To support a model for peroxisome maturation that initiates at the level of the ER, it is important to show the development of peroxisomes in relation to the ER in terms of the import of both peroxisomal membrane and matrix proteins. Using four-dimensional in vivo video microscopy, we showed the targeting of the peroxisomal membrane chimeric protein Pex3p-mRFP to punctate structures (Fig. 3A) that exhibited both the morphological (Fig. 2A) and biochemical (Fig. 2B) characteristics of a subdomain of the ER. The formation of this compartment was initiated by the expression of g46aa-GFP (Fig. 2A), and this compartment was also able to import fluorescently labeled derivatives of the PTS1-containing matrix protein Fox2p (gFox2p-mRFP-SKL) and the PTS2-containing matrix protein Pot1p (gPot1p-mRFP) (Fig. 3A). How this preperoxisomal compartment actually dissociates itself from the ER remains unknown. The targeting of the membrane proteins Pex2p, Pex3p, and Pex16p to peroxisomes was unaffected in mammalian cells blocked in COPI- or COPII-mediated vesicular transport (17South S.T. Sacksteder K.A.

However, experiments in H. polymorpha showed that a subset of peroxisomal proteins was trapped in the ER in cells treated with brefeldin A (6Salomons F.A. van der Klei I Kram A.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A possible role for COPI and COPII in peroxisome formation has yet to be investigated in S. cerevisiae. How g46aa-GFP reaches the ER is also unknown. Pex3p might have intrinsic properties that direct it to the ER, or other proteins might aid in delivering Pex3p to the ER. Inactivation of the ER translocation machinery components Sec61p and Ssh1p did not have an effect on peroxisome biogenesis (18South S.T. Baumgart E. Gould S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12027-12031Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This result has been taken by some researchers as proof that the ER was not involved in peroxisome biogenesis. However, proteins could enter the ER via some undefined mechanism independent of Sec61p or Ssh1p. Future experiments aimed at reconstituting in vitro the import of Pex3p into the ER should clarify this process. Our findings demonstrating a requirement for Pex14p and Pex19p in the formation of peroxisomes from the g46aa-GFP-labeled preperoxisomal compartment that are also capable of matrix protein import from the cytosol (Fig. 5) are consistent with a scenario in which Pex19p docks to Pex3p to facilitate the import of other peroxisomal membrane proteins such as Pex14p (32Fang Y. Morrell J.C. Jones J.M. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we show that the peroxisomal integral membrane protein Pex3p traffics through the ER and participates in the formation of preperoxisomal vesicles from this endomembrane system. Through the continued activity of Pex3p, these preperoxisomal vesicles can develop into bona fide peroxisomes via the import of peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins. Our findings demonstrate a direct role for the ER in the de novo formation of peroxisomes.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An additional 30 proteins are believed to be required for the assembly of the CcO complex (3Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of these accessory proteins are important in the processing and translation of COXI-COXIII mRNA transcripts, in membrane insertion of subunits, and in either the synthesis or delivery of cofactors. The cofactors in CcO include two copper sites (CuA and CuB), two heme A moieties, and a magnesium and zinc ion (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The CuA site is a binuclear, mixed valent copper center localized in the CoxII subunit, whereas the CuB site consists of a single copper ion within a Cu-heme A binuclear center in the CoxI subunit (4Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). The CoxI and CoxII subunits are synthesized within the mitochondrion, so copper site insertion must occur during insertion of the nascent polypeptides into the inner membrane. Several proteins, including Cox11, Cox17, Cox19, Cox23, and Sco1, have been implicated in the assembly of the copper centers in CcO in yeast and all have human homologs (5Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cox17 is a soluble copper metallochaperone within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). Sco1 and Cox11 are inner membrane proteins tethered by a single transmembrane helix and are implicated in the assembly of the CuA and CuB centers, respectively (6Hiser L. Di Valentin M. Hamer A.G. Hosler J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 7Dickinson E.K. Adams D.L. Schon E.A. Glerum D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26780-26785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Both proteins are copper-binding proteins, and mutations that abrogate Cu(I) binding attenuate in vivo assembly of CcO (8Rentzsch N. Krummeck-WeiB G. Hofer A. Bartuschka A. Ostermann K. Rodel G. Curr. Genet. 1999; 35: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31237-31242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that Cox17 is capable of donating Cu(I) to both Sco1 and Cox11 (12Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The prediction is that copper ions are only transiently bound to Sco1 and Cox11 in yeast prior to donation to CoxII and CoxI, respectively. Yeast Sco1 was shown to form a transient complex with CoxII (13Lode A. Kuschel M. Paret C. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 448: 1-6Google Scholar). Assembly of CcO in mammalian cells has additional components, since two distinct Sco-like molecules are involved in the assembly process. Mutations in both human genes, SCO1 and SCO2, have been identified, and these result in respiratory chain deficiency associated with CcO assembly defects (14Papadopolou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishion I. Sadlock J.E. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Van Coster R. Lyon G. Scalais E. Lebel R. Kaplan P. Shanske S. De Vivo D.C. Bonilla E. Hirano M. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Nat.

Genet. 2000; 9: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although yeast also has a second Sco protein, designated Sco2, it has no function in CcO assembly (17Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The human Sco1 and Sco2 molecules share the Cu(I) binding motif of yeast Sco1; however, nothing is currently known about the copper binding by human Sco1, whereas limited data exist on copper binding by human Sco2 (18Jaksch M. Paret C. Stucka R. Horn N. Muller-Hocker J. Horvath R. Trepesch N. Stecker G. Freisinger P. Thirion C. Muller J. Lunkwitz R. Rodel G. Shoubridge E.A. Lochmuller H. Hum. Mol.

Metab. 2004; 81: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Neither human Sco1 nor Sco2 is able to rescue the respiratory defect of yeast sco1 null cells (20Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, a chimera containing the N-terminal segment of yeast Sco1 fused to the C-terminal segment of human Sco1 is functional in sco1 null cells (20Paret C. Ostermann K. Krause-Buchholz U. Rentzsch A. Rodel G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence suggest that both human Sco1 and Sco2 proteins probably function in copper metallation of CcO. First, overexpression of COX17 partially rescues the CcO deficiency of SCO2, but not SCO1, patient cells (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Second, the CcO deficiency in SCO1 and SCO2 patient cell lines is partially suppressed by the addition of exogenous copper to the culture medium (18Jaksch M. Paret C. Stucka R. Horn N. Muller-Hocker J. Horvath R. Trepesch N. Stecker G. Freisinger P. Thirion C. Muller J. Lunkwitz R. Rodel G. Shoubridge E.A. Lochmuller H. Hum. Mol.

J. 2002; 15: 321-327Crossref Google Scholar). It is unclear why mammalian cells require two distinct Sco molecules for CcO maturation. Patients with mutations in SCO2 have a clinical presentation that is distinct from that of SCO1 patients (15Valnot I. Osmond S. Gigarel N. Mehaye B. Amiel J. Cormier-Daire V. Munnich A. Bonnefont J.-P. Rustin P. Rotig A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1104-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jaksch M. Ogilvie I. Yao J. Kortenhaus G. Bresser H.-G. Gerbitz K.-D. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 795-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 23Jaksch M. Horvath R. Horn N. Auer D.P. Macmillan C. Peters J. Gerbitz K.-D.

SCO2 mutations are associated with neonatal encephalocardiomyopathy, whereas SCO1 patients present with neonatal hepatic failure and ketoacidotic coma. The distinctive clinical presentation is not a result of tissue-specific expression of the two genes, since SCO1 and SCO2 are ubiquitously expressed and exhibit a similar expression pattern in different human tissues (14Papadopolou L.C. Sue C.M. Davidson M.M. Tanji K. Nishion I. Sadlock J.E. Selby J. Glerum D.M. Van Coster R. Lyon G. Scalais E. Lebel R. Kaplan P. Shanske S. De Vivo D.C. Bonilla E. Hirano M. DiMauro S. Schon E.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Recent studies with immortalized fibroblasts from SCO1 and SCO2 patients suggest that Sco1 and Sco2 have non-overlapping but cooperative functions in CcO assembly (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The evidence for this conclusion is that the CcO assembly pathway is blocked at a similar step in both SCO1 and SCO2 patient cell lines and that overexpression of either gene in the reciprocal patient cell line resulted in a dominant negative effect on CcO activity (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Although Sco proteins are reported to be competent to bind copper ions, this function was questioned in a recent report on the crystal structure of human Sco1 (24Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15202-15211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Sco1 crystallized without bound copper, and the three residues implicated in Cu(I) binding to yeast Sco1 were not in optimal configuration for trigonal Cu(I) binding (24Williams J.C. Sue C. Banting G.S. Yang H. Glerum D.M. Hendrickson W.A. Schon E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15202-15211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that Sco1 is not a copper metallochaperone essential for metal transfer to CoxII but stated that the protein may have a critical role in redox sensing. In this study, we analyze the copper binding properties of human Sco1 and Sco2 and report that copper binding appears to be important for the function of each protein. We report that both proteins have the ability to bind either Cu(I) or Cu(II) and that Cu(II) binding may be an important facet of function. Yeast Strains and Human Cell Lines—All yeast strains used were in W303 background (MAT a, ade2-1, his3-1,15, leu2,3,112, trp1-1, ura3-1). The strain cox17Δ-SCO2/COX17 for the yeast cytosolic assay was generated by transforming cox17 with pRS303-MET25-SCO2/COX17 (25Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cox17-SCO2/COX17 strain was cultured on plates or in liquid in complete medium lacking uracil for pYEF2 selection or lacking leucine for pRS315 selection. sco1Δ cells were cultured on plates or in liquid in complete medium lacking tryptophan for TNDW4(SCO1) selection (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured with glucose, raffinose, or galactose as carbon sources as described before. DNA transformations were performed using a lithium acetate protocol. Primary cell lines from control SCO1 and SCO2 patient skin fibroblasts were immortalized and cultured as previously described (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Plasmids— hSCO1 (lacking the first 333 bp) or hSCO2 (lacking the first 234 bp) amplified by PCR was cloned into pHis-parallel 2 to generate pHis-hSCO1 or pHis-hSCO2 by adding BamHI and SalI restriction sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The same hSCO fragment fused to a 5′ sequence encoding a poly-His purification tag was amplified from pHis-hSCO1 or pHis-hSCO2 by PCR with NotI and EcoRI restriction sites added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The truncated SCO1 genes were subcloned into pYEF2 containing the GAL1 promoter and CYC1 terminator for transformation of cox17Δ-SCO2/COX17 cells. The plasmid is designated YEp-GAL1-hSCO1 or YEp-GAL1-hSCO2. Mutagenesis of SCO genes was carried out using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on both pHis-hSCO1 and pTNDW4 (yeast SCO1). The resulting SCO1 mutants were sequenced, and those in pTNDW4 were subcloned to ensure there were no mutations in the plasmid backbones. The construction of YCp-MET25-hCOX17 and pRS303-MET25-SCO2/COX17 was similar to the construction of YCp-MET25-COX17 and YCp-MET25-SCO2/COX17 described previously. The Sco2-Cox17 fusion contains the 5,104 residues of Sco2, including the N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence and transmembrane domain of Sco2 fused to Cox17. The correct sequences of all plasmids generated in this study were confirmed by sequencing. Wild type hSCO1 and hSCO2 cloned into the gateway-modified retroviral expression vector pLXSH or pBABE were used as templates to generate specific point mutants using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The fidelity of all resultant constructs was confirmed by sequencing prior to their use in expression studies. Protein Purification—Recombinant human and yeast Sco and mutant Sco were purified from BL21 (DE3) transformants harboring pHis-hSCO or pTNDW2 (His-tagged SCO1 or mutant SCO1) as described previously by Nittis et al. (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Nickel-NTA Superflow (Qiagen) was used for the purification of the His-tagged Sco proteins. Yeast transformants with YEp-GAL1-hSCO were cultured in raffinose medium to an A600 of 0.6. Galactose was then added to induce expression of the His-tagged Sco. Cells were harvested after 5 h for preparation of lysates by use of a French press and subsequent Ni2+-NTA purification from clarified samples. UV-visible Electronic Absorption and Electronic Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopies—Absorption spectra of a sample in a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm were recorded with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. X-band EPR spectra were obtained on a 9-GHz Bruker EMX spectrometer. All samples were run at 77 K in a liquid nitrogen finger Dewar. Spin quantitation was determined relative to a 0.5 mm CuEDTA standard. Assays—The copper and nickel concentration of the protein samples was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences (AAnalyst 100) atomic absorption spectrophotometer or a PerkinElmer Optima (3100XL) ICP spectrometer. A bathocuproine sulfonate assay was used to determine the Cu(I) content of the protein samples. The appearance of a Cu(bathocuproine sulfonate)2 complex was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 483 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 12,250 cm-1 m-1. Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl at 110 °C in vacuo on a Beckman 6300 analyzer. Oxygen consumption assays were performed on a YSI 5300A biological oxygen monitor. The rate of oxygen consumption of each strain was calculated based on the linear portion. Each strain was assayed repeatedly two or three times to get the average rate. Immunoblot Analysis—Protein (10-50 μg) from the mitochondrial fraction was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel system and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (50 mm Na2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), 0.01% Tween 20, and 10% milk solution prior to detection with appropriate antibodies and visualization with Pierce chemiluminescence reagents using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Antiserum to porin (Por1) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-Sco1 antiserum was generated as described previously (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Immortalized human fibroblasts were differentially permeabilized using digitonin in order to generate mitochondrially enriched fractions (26Klement P. Nijtmans L.G. Van den Bogert C. Houstek J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and subsequently solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5% lauryl maltoside supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blotted with polyclonal antisera raised against human Sco1 (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Sco2 (18Jaksch M. Paret C. Stucka R. Horn N. Muller-Hocker J. Horvath R. Trepesch N. Stecker G. Freisinger P. Thirion C. Muller J. Lunkwitz R. Rodel G. Shoubridge E.A. Lochmuller H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 3025-3035Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and a monoclonal anti-porin antibody (Calbiochem). Following incubation with the relevant secondary antibody, immunoreactive proteins were detected by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Miscellaneous—Phoenix amphotropic cells (Dr. G. Nolan, Stanford University) were used to transiently produce and package all individual human cDNA constructs of interest. Subsequent infection and selection of fibroblast cell lines were essentially as previously described (21Leary S.C. Kaufman B.A. Pellechia G. Gguercin G.-H. Mattman A. Jaksch M. Shoubridge E.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1839-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Protein concentration (27Bradford N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), CcO (28Capaldi R.A. Marusich M.F. Taanman J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and citrate synthase (29Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-26Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) activities were measured as described elsewhere. Recombinant Human Sco1 and Sco2 Expression—To study the biochemical properties of the globular domains of human Sco1 and Sco2, truncates were engineered lacking only the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence and single transmembrane helix (Fig. 1). Soluble domains of each protein were used for our studies to avoid the difficulties of purifying and working with membrane proteins. Soluble domains of human SCO1 and SCO2 fused to a 5′ poly-His tag were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells for the purpose of purification by Ni2+-NTA chromatography and subsequent characterization of the two proteins. Protein recovered after imidazole elution was found to contain bound copper by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Each protein fraction was subsequently chromatographed on gel filtration to recover homogeneous Sco1 and Sco2. Both proteins eluted from gel filtration in fractions corresponding to monomeric molecules. The copper content of hSco1 and hSco2 was 1.0 and 0.8 mol eq, respectively. Dialysis of the copper-containing proteins overnight in 1 mm EDTA resulted in only a slight depletion of bound copper, with human Sco1 and Sco2 each retaining 0.8 mol eq of bound copper (TABLE ONE). No metal ions other than low levels of Ni(II), derived from the Ni2+-NTA resin used in the purification, were detected using ICP spectroscopy. Samples dialyzed against EDTA were depleted of the minimal levels of Ni(II). Cleavage of the poly-His tag followed by subsequent purification of the non-tagged protein retained 80% of the bound copper. Thus, the copper ions bound to the fusion protein were associated with the Sco1 protein and not the His purification tag. The copper ions were stably associated with both Sco proteins.TABLE ONECopper binding stoichiometry of human Sco1 and Sco2 purified from bacteria The Sco proteins were purified by a combination of Ni2+-NTA chromatography and gel filtration.

The visible absorption bands resembled the S-Cu(II) charge transfer bands of nitrosocyanin (30Lieberman R.L. Arciero D.M. Hooper A.B. Rosenzweig A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5674-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Basumallick L. Sarangi R. George S.D. Elmore B. Hooper A.B. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 3531-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the presence of bound Cu(II) in human Sco1 as purified was confirmed by EPR (Fig. 3A). Integration of the EPR signal revealed a Cu(II) content of 0.3 mol eq. Titration of human Sco1 with the Cu(I) chromogenic chelator bathocuproine sulfonate revealed a Cu(I) content of 0.7 mol eq. The stoichiometry in combination with EPR spectroscopy suggests that each monomeric Sco1 molecule contains either a bound Cu(I) or a bound Cu(II). The fraction of bound Cu(I) versus Cu(II) was similar in multiple isolates of hSco1. To determine the binding stability of the two valence states of copper, hSco1 dialyzed overnight with 1 mm EDTA revealed a Cu(II) content of 0.17 mol eq, whereas the total copper content dropped to 0.78 mol eq. Although the Cu(II) content was reduced 2-fold by the EDTA dialysis treatment, the chromophore content was unchanged. The dialysis result is consistent with the EPR spectrum that forms two gz values with different hyperfine splittings, indicating the presence of two Cu(II) species in human Sco1 (Fig. 3A). Although human Sco1 contains two Cu(II) species, only one generates the chromophore. Two distinct Cu(II) species were also observed in the Sco1 protein from Bacillus subtilis (32Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Cioffi-Baffoni S. Structure. 2003; 11: 1431-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3EPR spectrum of human and yeast Sco1 samples. A, EPR spectrum of human and yeast Sco1 proteins as isolated. The concentrations of the human and yeast proteins were 2.3 and 2.4 mm, respectively. Shown are the hyperfine splittings of the gz components. The presence of two gz components suggests the presence of two distinct Cu(II) species. B, the spectrum of the human Sco1 sample (0.67 mm) dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT is shown. EPR spectra were recorded at 9.429 GHz with a power of 19.8 milliwatts with a modulation amplitude of 4 G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incubation of hSco1 with 1 mm DTT overnight reduced the Cu(II) content from 0.35 to 0.24 mol eq, but the chromophore content was unchanged (TABLE ONE). Thus, the Cu(II) species that is responsible for the visible chromophore is stable to dialysis in 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm DTT. The EPR spectrum of the CuSco1 sample after dialysis in EDTA and DTT is shown in Fig. 3B. This spectrum is characterized by only four hyperfine splittings of the gz component of the Cu(II) signal. This pattern of hyperfine splitting is consistent with a single Cu(II) species that gives rise to the visible absorption bands. Prolonged incubation of Sco1 at 4 °C did not alter the abundance of the Cu(II) chromophore. As mentioned, the chromophore was not bleached by 1 mm DTT but was abolished by dithionite. After bleaching by 2 mm dithionite followed by dialysis in buffer, the copper content was reduced by an increment corresponding to the quantity of copper originally present as Cu(II). Thus, upon reduction of Cu(II), the Cu(I) is unable to stably associate with the Sco1. Analogous experiments with human Sco2 found that the Cu(I) and Cu(II) adducts were indistinguishable from those of human Sco1. Collectively, these data argue that the unique function of each human Sco in the metallation of CcO is not attributable to differences in their copper-binding properties. The EPR spectrum of Cu(II)Sco1 (Fig. 3B) shows features that are typical of 14N ligand hyperfine interaction (a three-line pattern from the I = 1 nucleus superimposed on a four-line pattern from the I = 3/2 63,65Cu hyperfine) that is expected from a histidine nitrogen ligation of the metal. This is illustrated by the inset in Fig. 3B, which shows the second derivative of the gx-gy region of the Cu(II) EPR spectrum, with clear structure attributable to 14N ligand hyperfine to at least one such ligand. A more complete analysis of the EPR spectroscopy of Cu(II)Sco1, including multifrequency measurements will be presented in a subsequent publication. Previously, we reported the presence of Cu(I) in yeast Sco1, but only a percentage of the copper was reactive with the Cu(I) chelator bathocuproine sulfonate (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42520-42526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine whether yeast Sco1 also contained bound Cu(II), the soluble domain of yeast Sco1 was recombinantly expressed and purified as described previously (9Nittis T. George G.N. Winge D.R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2172196261,"In Escherichia coli, the periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA is thought to be a powerful but nonspecific oxidant, joining cysteines together the moment they enter the periplasm. DsbC, the primary disulfide isomerase, likely resolves incorrect disulfides. Given the reliance of protein function on correct disulfide bonds, it is surprising that no phenotype has been established for null mutations in dsbC. Here we demonstrate that mutations in the entire DsbC disulfide isomerization pathway cause an increased sensitivity to the redox-active metal copper. We find that copper catalyzes periplasmic disulfide bond formation under aerobic conditions and that copper catalyzes the formation of disulfide-bonded oligomers in vitro, which DsbC can resolve. Our data suggest that the copper sensitivity of dsbC– strains arises from the inability of the cell to rearrange copper-catalyzed non-native disulfides in the absence of functional DsbC. Absence of functional DsbA augments the deleterious effects of copper on a dsbC– strain, even though the dsbA– single mutant is unaffected by copper. This may indicate that DsbA successfully competes with copper and forms disulfide bonds more accurately than copper does. These findings lead us to a model in which DsbA may be significantly more accurate in disulfide oxidation than previously thought, and in which the primary role of DsbC may be to rearrange incorrect disulfide bonds that are formed during certain oxidative stresses.

Most periplasmic Escherichia coli proteins contain at least two cysteine residues and many are stable and active only when these cysteines form their native disulfide bond pairings (1Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In E. coli, a family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases ensures that periplasmic and secreted proteins form correct disulfide bonds. DsbA is the primary disulfide oxidant in the periplasm. It rapidly donates its disulfide directly to substrate proteins and oxidizes them (2Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). DsbA is believed to act as a relatively nonspecific oxidant, joining any two cysteines that approach each other (3Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). A dsbA– strain shows several in vivo phenotypes, including attenuated virulence and loss of motility, because of the absence of disulfide bonds in proteins involved in these pathways (4Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 5Watarai M. Tobe T. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).DsbC, a second periplasmic thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, appears to function as a disulfide isomerase both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DsbC has been shown to rearrange non-native disulfides in well studied isomerization substrates such as BPTI and RNase A (6Zapun A. Missiakas D. Raina S. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Bader M.W. Xie T. Yu C.A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26082-26088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In vivo, DsbC is required for full activity of a handful of proteins containing at least one non-consecutive disulfide bond (1Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We have found that the periplasmic proteins RNase I (four disulfides, one non-consecutive) and MepA (three disulfides, two non-consecutive) require DsbC for their stability and, in the case of RNase I, in vivo activity (1Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Berkmen et al. (3Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar) recently showed that the folding of Agp (three consecutive disulfides) becomes DsbC-dependent with the introduction of a non-consecutive disulfide bond. These results suggest that the principal role of DsbC under non-stress conditions is to rearrange disulfide bonds that DsbA forms incorrectly.A key question remaining in disulfide biology is the relative importance of disulfide oxidation and disulfide isomerization during in vivo protein folding. The disulfide oxidation pathway in the E. coli periplasm is well characterized, with about 25 proteins identified that require DsbA for correct folding and functioning (2Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 8Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, only three in vivo substrates have been found for DsbC, and none have been found for the second periplasmic disulfide isomerase DsbG (1Hiniker A. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12967-12973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3Berkmen M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas a dsbA– strain shows pleiotropic phenotypes, no consistent phenotype has yet been found for a dsbC– or dsbG– strain. This suggests that disulfide isomerization may be less important under non-stress conditions than previously believed.Here we show that mutants lacking any part of the DsbC disulfide isomerization pathway are less viable than isogenic wild-type strains under oxidative copper stress conditions. We show that copper, a redox-active metal, catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds in vivo, and appears to introduce incorrect disulfides more frequently than DsbA does. Our data suggest that the copper sensitivity of dsbC– strains arises from the inability of the cell to rearrange copper-catalyzed non-native disulfide bonds in the absence of functional DsbC. Intriguingly, this may indicate a role for DsbC in combating periplasmic oxidative stress.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in TABLE ONE. For copper sensitivity assays, bacteria were grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) 3The abbreviations used are: BHI, brain heart infusion; DTT, dithiothreitol; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; drRNase A, denatured and reduced RNase A. media (Difco). For motility assays, malF-lacZ assays, and the alkaline phosphatase assay, an M63 minimal media was used (13.6 g of KH2PO4/2 g of (NH4)2SO4/0.5 mg FeSO4·7H2O, pH 7.0) with 0.4% glucose, 0.1% casamino acids, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 μg/ml thiamine, 2 μg/ml biotin, 2 μg/ml nicotinamide, and 0.2 μg/ml riboflavin. Media was supplemented with 100 μg/ml X-gal and/or CuCl2, AgNO3, MnCl2, ZnCl2, NiSO4, CoCl2, or iron(III) citrate to a final concentration between 0.05 mm and 30 mm as required for the assays. Strains were grown at 34 °C rather than 37 °C as we found that the copper phenotype was more pronounced at this temperature. The BL21 dsbC– strain AH131 was created by P1 transduction of dsbC::kan moved out of SR3324 (MC4100 dsbC::kan obtained from George Georgiou) into wild-type BL21. AH358 (AH50 ΔdsbC::cm dsbA::kan1) was created by P1 transduction of dsbA::kan1 out of JCB571 (Bardwell laboratory strain) into AH65 (AH50 ΔdsbC::cm).

The values shown represent the average of at least three separate experiments.In Vitro Copper Oxidation—DsbC was purified as described previously using nickel chromatography via a His6 tag (10Bader M.W. Hiniker A. Regeimbal J. Goldstone D. Haebel P.W. Riemer J. Metcalf P. Bardwell J.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It was reduced for 10 min on ice with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and the DTT was removed by buffer exchange into 25 mm Hepes pH 7.5 using a Nap 5 column (Amersham Biosciences). Bovine pancreatic RNase A was purchased from Sigma, reduced and denatured in 7 m guanidinium chloride, 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 120 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA at 25 °C for 2 h, and buffer-exchanged into 0.1% acetic acid. Denatured and reduced RNase A (drRNase A) was quantified using ϵ275.5 = 9,300 m–1 cm–1, whereas native RNase A was quantified using ϵ275.5 = 9,800 m–1 cm–1 (Swiss Protein Database). The thiol content of reduced DsbC and drRNase A was measured with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described, and both were found to be >90% reduced (11Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Proteins were flash-frozen and stored at ≤ –20 °C until use.For oxidation by copper/H2O2, native RNase A or drRNase A was diluted into 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6 to a final concentration of 50 μm in the presence of 50 μm CuCl2, 2 mm H2O2, 50 μm CuCl2/2 mm H2O2, or buffer alone and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. CuCl2/H2O2 was removed and buffer was exchanged by gel filtration to 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The protein concentration after gel filtration was measured by a Bradford assay (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar); the thiol oxidation status was measured with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Samples were diluted to 20 μm, incubated with or without 20 μm reduced DsbC for 2 h at 25°C, and run under reducing and non-reducing conditions on a 14% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen). To test the ability of DsbC to restore activity to copper-oxidized RNase A, 200-μl aliquots of the above samples were added to 4 mm cCMP (final concentration) in 400 μl (final volume) of 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The hydrolysis of cCMP was followed at 296 nm for 300 s and the initial hydrolysis rate for the first 30 s of the measurement was recorded. The initial hydrolysis rate of an equimolar amount of native RNase A was set to 100% activity and all other samples expressed as percent native RNase A activity.RESULTSThe DsbC Disulfide Isomerization Pathway Is Involved in Copper Resistance—Given the importance of proper protein folding to the well being of the cell, it is surprising that no clear phenotype has yet been found for null mutations in the E. coli principal disulfide isomerase, DsbC. Missiakas et al. (13Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 14Missiakas D. Schwager F. Raina S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3415-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported that dsbC– strains are benzylpenicillin and DTT-sensitive. However, we and others have been unable to repeat the DTT sensitivity (data not shown). 4G. Georgiou, personal communication. We can reproduce dsbC– benzylpenicillin sensitivity but only in certain strain backgrounds (data not shown). Previous work by Rietsch et al. (9Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) demonstrated that dsbD– strains are sensitive to the redox-active metal copper and that thioredoxin mutants are also sensitive to copper, but less so than a dsbD– strain. It is known that thioredoxin passes electrons to DsbD, maintaining DsbD in reduced and active form (15Rietsch A. Bessette P. Georgiou G. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6602-6608Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). DsbD then passes electrons to a number of periplasmic proteins, including DsbC (16Porat A. Cho S.H. Beckwith J. Res. Microbiol. 2004; 155: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed possible that the entire disulfide isomerization pathway might be involved in copper resistance and that dsbC– strains would also be copper-sensitive, despite previous reports that did not observe dsbC– copper sensitivity (13Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).To test this, we compared the ability of wild-type strains and strains lacking individual dsb genes to grow on various concentrations of CuCl2 (strains listed in TABLE ONE). In agreement with Rietsch et al. (9Rietsch A. Belin D. Martin N. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13048-13053Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), we found that a mutation in dsbD causes increased sensitivity to copper (TABLE TWO). Whereas the MC1000-derived wild-type strain AH50 grew on BHI-copper plates at 11 mm CuCl2, the isogenic dsbD– strain, AH392, was unable to form single colonies at 8 mm CuCl2. Importantly, we found that dsbC– strains were also copper-sensitive, exhibiting the same copper-sensitive phenotype as the dsbD– strain. To ensure that our result was not dependent on strain background, we compared the copper sensitivity of wild-type and dsbC– MC4100 and BL21 strains and found that the dsbC– mutant was copper-sensitive in all three strain backgrounds tested (data not shown). We also reintroduced wild-type DsbC expressed from the pBAD33 plasmid into the dsbC– strain, and found that DsbC expressed from this plasmid restored copper resistance to wild-type levels. We note that our strongest phenotype is found when the strains are grown on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar, a very rich media. The experiments of Metheringham et al. (17Metheringham R. Tyson K.L. Crooke H. Missiakas D. Raina S. Cole J.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 95-102PubMed Google Scholar) that failed to show dsbC– copper sensitivity were done on LB agar, where we see a weaker, but still clear, phenotype.TABLE TWOCopper sensitivities of null mutations in the E. coli periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductasesStrainGenotype8 mm CuCl24 mm CuCl2AH50Wild-type++++aViability relative to wild type, ranging from wild-type-sized single colonies (++++) to not viable (-).++++aViability relative to wild type, ranging from wild-type-sized single colonies (++++) to not viable (-).AH55dsbA-++++++++AH392dsbD--++++AH65dsbC--++++AH66dsbG-++++++++AH396dsbA- dsbD---AH358dsbA- dsbC---a Viability relative to wild type, ranging from wild-type-sized single colonies (++++) to not viable (-). Open table in a new tab DsbG is a second putative periplasmic disulfide isomerase that is 30% identical to DsbC at the amino acid level (18Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7784-7792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We compared the copper sensitivity of dsbG– and wild-type strains and found no appreciable difference between the wild-type and dsbG– cells, both in MC1000 and in BL21. At 11 mm CuCl2, dsbG– colonies were slightly smaller than wild-type colonies; however, the effect was much less dramatic than for dsbC– strains, which failed to grow at all under these conditions. When wild-type DsbG was overexpressed from the pBAD33 plasmid in the dsbC– strain, DsbG could only partially rescue dsbC– copper sensitivity. We conclude that of the two disulfide isomerases, DsbC is chiefly responsible for maintaining wild-type levels of copper resistance in vivo, but that DsbG may play a small role as well.To determine whether a dsbC– strain shows increased sensitivity to other metals, the relative growth of isogenic dsbC– and wild-type strains were tested on BHI plates supplemented with silver(I) nitrate, manganese(II) chloride, iron(III) citrate, zinc(II) chloride, nickel(II) sulfate, or cobalt(II) chloride. All metals were tested in increments of 1 mm or less until the lethal concentration of the metal in the wild-type strain was reached. AH65 (dsbC–) showed no increased sensitivity to any of these metals relative to AH50, the isogenic wild type. Additionally, under anaerobic conditions, wild-type and dsbC– strains were equally resistant to copper treatment.Copper Catalyzes Disulfide Bond Formation in Vivo—Two mechanisms can explain the requirement for the DsbC disulfide isomerization pathway under conditions of copper stress. One possibility is that there exists at least one DsbC substrate protein that becomes essential under copper stress conditions but that is not essential during normal growth. In this case, the substrate would always require disulfide isomerization by DsbC for its correct folding but would only become essential in the presence of copper. Copper is a toxic metal, so periplasmic or membrane proteins involved in copper homeostasis are appropriate candidates. To be consistent with our observations that dsbC– strains are not copper-sensitive when grown anaerobically and are not sensitive to other metals tested, the substrate should be important to copper resistance under aerobic but not anaerobic conditions and should not be involved in resistance to any of the other metals tested. To require DsbC for folding, the substrate should have three or more cysteine residues and need disulfide isomerization to achieve its native structure. A number of proteins are involved in copper resistance (see Rensing and Grass for a review, Ref. 19Rensing C. Grass G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 197-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), but we have not found any that meet these criteria. Many copper resistance proteins are important both aerobically and anaerobically (such as the P-type ATPase CopA), and others are involved in resistance to multiple metals (the Cus proteins are important for silver as well as copper resistance). The multi-copper oxidase CueO functions in copper resistance only under aerobic conditions and contains three cysteine residues. However, the crystal structure of this protein has been solved, and reveals no disulfide bonds (20Roberts S.A. Weichsel A. Grass G. Thakali K. Hazzard J.T. Tollin G. Rensing C. Montfort W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2766-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). While it is possible that DsbC does act on a copper homeostasis protein, we have been unable to find a likely candidate among the known copper resistance proteins.A second possibility is that copper stress may lead to incorrect disulfide bonds in proteins that do not normally require disulfide isomerization. In this case, copper stress might cause DsbC to become essential because copper is catalyzing the formation of non-native disulfide bonds. It has recently been shown that copper can form in vitro disulfides in protein substrates (21Kachur A.V. Koch C.J. Biaglow J.E. Free Radic Res. 1999; 31: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Matsui Lee I.S. Suzuki M. Hayashi N. Hu J. Van Eldik L.J. Titani K. Nishikimi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine whether copper can catalyze disulfide bonds in vivo, we looked at the ability of copper to complement a dsbA– phenotype.A dsbA– strain exhibits a number of phenotypes caused by a generalized loss of disulfide bond formation. On minimal media, a dsbA– strain is unable to form the single disulfide in the flagellar motor protein FlgI that is required for FlgI folding. Therefore, dsbA– strains are not motile while wild-type strains are motile (23Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of copper to restore motility to a dsbA– strain. In the absence of copper, only the dsbA+ strain JCB816 exhibited motility, while JCB817, the dsbA– strain, was completely non-motile (TABLE THREE). In the presence of 0.2 mm copper, however, the dsbA– strain became nearly as motile as wild type, showing that copper was able to form the single disulfide in FlgI and restore motility.TABLE THREECopper complements mutations in the DsbA-DsbB pathwayStrainGenotypePhenotype on minimal mediaPhenotype on minimal media + CuCl2MotilityMalF-βgalMotilityMalF-βgalJCB816Wild-type+ + + +aMotility relative to wild type, ranging from wild-type levels of motility (+ + + +) to non-motile (—).White+ + + +aMotility relative to wild type, ranging from wild-type levels of motility (+ + + +) to non-motile (—).WhiteJCB817dsbA——Blue+ + +WhiteJCB818dsbA— dsbB——Blue+ + +Whitea Motility relative to wild type, ranging from wild-type levels of motility (+ + + +) to non-motile (—). Open table in a new tab The ability of copper to introduce disulfides in FlgI is possibly specific to this protein and may not apply to other periplasmic or membrane proteins. To determine whether copper introduces disulfides more widely, we looked at disulfide formation in a disulfide detector protein, a malF-lacZ fusion construct (23Dailey F.E. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This disulfide detector consists of β-galactosidase, normally a cytoplasmic protein with four thiol groups, fused to the inner membrane protein MalF (24Silhavy T.J. Casadaban M.J. Shuman H.A. Beckwith J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3423-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the presence of functional DsbA, it is believed that non-native disulfide bonds are formed in β-galactosidase, causing it to be inactive (25Tian H. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4730-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the absence of a periplasmic disulfide oxidant, β-galactosidase retains its reduced thiol groups and can fold to its active form (25Tian H. Boyd D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4730-4735Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous work, JCB816, a wild-type strain expressing the MalF-LacZ fusion protein, was white on X-gal, indicating that β-galactosidase was inactive in this strain and thus contained non-native disulfides (TABLE THREE). In contrast, JCB817, a dsbA– strain isogenic with JCB816, was blue on X-gal, illustrating that disulfide bonds could not form. In the presence of 0.1 mm CuCl2, the dsbA– strain JCB817 became white on X-gal, suggesting that copper was catalyzing disulfide bond formation in the MalF-LacZ protein.To examine whether copper rescue of disulfide bond formation depends on DsbB, the native reoxidant of DsbA, we repeated the motility and MalF-LacZ assays using a dsbA– dsbB– double mutant, JCB818. JCB818 was non-motile on minimal motility medium but also nearly as motile as wild type in the presence of 0.2 mm copper (TABLE THREE). Similarly, JCB818 was blue on X-gal alone and white on X-gal-0.1 mm CuCl2 plates. These findings indicate that copper can bypass the entire DsbA-DsbB pathway and form de novo disulfides in periplasmic proteins.Disulfide Bond Formation and DsbC– Sensitivity Are Unique to Aerobic Copper Stress—The ability of copper to complement a dsbA–dsbB– strain demonstrates that copper forms de novo disulfide bonds in vivo. If copper-catalyzed disulfide formation causes dsbC– copper sensitivity, then metals that do not cause dsbC– sensitivity should not catalyze disulfide bond formation. We therefore tested the metals that did not cause dsbC– sensitivity for their ability to form disulfide bonds by measuring their ability to both inhibit MalF-LacZ activity and restore motility in a dsbA– strain. Silver(I) nitrate, manganese(II) chloride, iron(III) citrate, zinc(II) chloride, nickel(II) sulfate, and cobalt(II) chloride were each examined at a range of concentrations from 0 mm to the lethal concentration for that metal. Addition of silver(I) nitrate, manganese(II) chloride, or iron(III) citrate did not inhibit β-galactosidase activity at any concentration tested. Although zinc(II) chloride, nickel(II) sulfate, and cobalt(II) chloride were able to inhibit β-galactosidase activity in the MalF-LacZ assay, none of the metals could restore motility in the dsbA– strain at any concentration tested. Furthermore, the wild-type strain remained motile in the presence of these metals. Of the metals tested, only copper could both abolish MalF-LacZ activity and rescue motility in a dsbA– strain. This indicates that in vivo disulfide bond formation is not a universal property of metal cations.We postulated that copper complementation of a dsbA– strain could be due to the specific redox properties of copper. The conversion of Cu2+ to Cu1+ has a redox potential of 0.153 V, likely allowing Cu2+ to oxidize free thiol groups and then become re-oxidized by oxygen species. Most other metals have properties that do not allow them to redox cycle: they either have redox potentials that do not allow re-oxidation by oxygen species, do not have multiple redox states, or are largely insoluble under physiologic conditions. Redox cycling of copper likely requires the presence of molecular oxygen species in order to re-oxidize copper after it has oxidized thiol groups. We tested the ability of copper to restore disulfide bond formation in the absence of oxygen species by testing motility under anaerobic conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, copper could not restore motility to a dsbA– strain at any copper concentration tested, supporting the idea that in vivo disulfide bond formation by copper relies on the presence of molecular oxygen. This was in good agreement with our finding that, under anaerobic conditions, wild-type and dsbC– strains were equally resistant to copper treatment.Copper Forms Non-native Disulfide Bonds in Vivo—Our motility and MalF-LacZ assays indicate that copper catalyzes periplasmic disulfide bond formation. To address whether copper forms a high proportion of non-native disulfide bonds in the cell, we examined the effect of copper on a strain with an increased number of periplasmic proteins harboring exposed thiol groups. If copper forms incorrect disulfide bonds between any free thiol groups, this strain might be especially sensitive to the effects of copper in the absence of a disulfide isomerase such as DsbC. A dsbA– strain exactly fits these criteria because it lacks DsbA and therefore acquires disulfides more slowly than a wild-type strain (2Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J.

https://openalex.org/W2156186195,"We have identified a domain in the N terminus of huntingtin that binds to membranes. A three-dimensional homology model of the structure of the binding domain predicts helical HEAT repeats, which emanate a positive electrostatic potential, consistent with a charge-based mechanism for membrane association. An amphipathic helix capable of inserting into pure lipid bilayers may serve to anchor huntingtin to the membrane. In cells, N-terminal huntingtin fragments targeted to regions of plasma membrane enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, receptor bound-transferrin, and endogenous huntingtin. N-terminal huntingtin fragments with an expanded polyglutamine tract aberrantly localized to intracellular regions instead of plasma membrane. Our data support a new model in which huntingtin directly binds membranes through electrostatic interactions with acidic phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2122623281,"Complement is the canonical innate immune system involved in host defense and tissue repair with the clearance of cell debris. In contrast to the robust armory mounted against microbial nonself-pathogens, complement is selectively activated on altered self (i.e. apoptotic and necrotic cells) to instruct the safe demise by poorly characterized mechanisms. Our data shed new light on the role of complement C1q in sensing nucleic acids (NA) rapidly exposed on apoptotic Jurkat T cell membranes and in driving C3 opsonization but without the lytic membrane attack complex. DNA/RNase-treated apoptotic cells failed to activate complement. We found that several other apoptotic cell models, including senescent keratinocytes, ionophore-treated sperm cells, and CMK-derived platelets, stained for cleaved caspase 3 were rapidly losing the key complement regulator CD46. CD46 from nuclear and membrane stores was found to cluster into blebs and shed into microparticles together with NA, phosphatidylserine, C1q, and factor H. Classical and alternative pathways of complement were involved in the recognition of H2O2-treated necrotic cells. Membrane attack complex was detected on necrotic cells possibly as a result of CD46 and CD59 shedding into soluble forms. Our data highlight a novel and universal paradigm whereby the complement innate immune system is using two synergistic strategies with the recognition of altered self-NA and missing self-CD46 signals to instruct and tailor the efficient removal of apoptotic and necrotic cells in immunoprivileged sites."
https://openalex.org/W2076643673,"Ovarian cancer G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1) and GPR4 have recently been identified as proton-sensing or extracellular pHresponsive G-protein-coupled receptors stimulating inositol phosphate production and cAMP accumulation, respectively. In the present study, we found that OGR1 and GPR4 mRNAs were expressed in human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs). Acidic extracellular pH induced inositol phosphate production, a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), and cAMP accumulation in these cells. When small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted for OGR1 and GPR4 were transfected to the cells, the acidinduced inositol phosphate production and [Ca2+]i increase were markedly inhibited by the OGR1 siRNA but not by the GPR4 siRNA. Unexpectedly, the acid-induced cAMP accumulation was also largely inhibited by OGR1 siRNA but only slightly by GPR4 siRNA. Acidic extracellular pH also stimulated prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) production, which was again inhibited by OGR1 siRNA. The specific inhibitors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and cyclooxygenase attenuated the acid-induced PGI2 production and cAMP accumulation without changes in the inositol phosphate production. A specific inhibitor of phospholipase C also inhibited the acid-induced cAMP accumulation. In conclusion, OGR1 is a major receptor involved in the extracellular acid-induced stimulation of PGI2 production and cAMP accumulation in AoSMCs. The cAMP accumulation may occur through OGR1-mediated stimulation of the phospholipase C/cyclooxygenase/PGI2 pathway.

Acidification of extracellular or interstitial space has been proposed to occur under many physiological and pathophysiological circumstances, such as ischemia, tumor, inflammation, and exercise. Acidosis has been shown to induce a variety of responses at whole animal, tissues, and cellular levels.

Therefore, acid-induced cAMP accumulation and changes in [Ca2+]i may play an important role in the acidinduced variety of physiological and pathophysiological responses that were previously reported (see above). However, the mechanism of how acidification modulates the cellular levels of cAMP and [Ca2+]i has not yet been characterized. In our search for model systems in which acidification actually induces change in cellular cAMP and [Ca2+]i levels, we found that AoSMCs respond to acidic pH leading to substantial cAMP accumulation and [Ca2+]i increase. Moreover, we found that acidification causes PGI2 production in AoSMCs. PGI2 has been known to regulate the cellular activities of SMC, for example, the inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of relaxation (23Weber A.A. Zucker T.P. Hasse A. Bonisch D. Wittpoth M. Schror K. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1998; 93: 54-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that these responses are mediated mainly by OGR1 and only slightly, if at all, by GPR4. This is the first indication that OGR1 is actually involved in the regulation of the cellular activities of vascular SMCs.

For the cAMP assay and inositol phosphate assay, the cells were plated on 12- or 24-multiplates. Twenty-four hours before the experiments, the medium was changed to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum) containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA (fraction V) for cAMP response and was changed to TCM199 (without serum) containing 2 μCi of [myo-3H]inositol (in 1 ml) and 0.1% BSA for the inositol phosphate assay. cAMP Accumulation—AoSMCs were washed once and preincubated for 20 min (with PD98059 or indomethacin) or 5 min (with U73122 or U73343) at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered medium. The HEPES-buffered medium was composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 134 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm NaHCO3,5mm glucose, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA (fraction V). The cells were then incubated for 30 min under the indicated pH in the presence of 0.5 mm IBMX and these inhibitors in a final volume of 0.6 ml. To cover a wider pH range, the incubation medium was buffered with the mixture of HEPES/EPPS/MES (8 mm each). Where indicated, appropriate test agents were supplemented with the incubation medium. All data in this report are referenced to pH at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. The cAMP in the acid extract was measured using the cAMP radioimmunoassay kit (Yamasa, Chosi, Japan). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—The cells were harvested from 10-cm dishes with trypsin and labeled with Fura2/AM. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured based on the change in Fura2 fluorescence as described previously (25Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K.

Inositol Phosphate Production—[myo-2-3H]Inositol-labeled AoSMCs were washed once and preincubated in a similar way as that for cAMP assay as described above. The cells were then further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in HEPES/EPPS/MES-buffered medium with an appropriate pH in the presence of 10 mm LiCl and test inhibitors. Total inositol phosphates including inositol mono-, di-, and tri-phosphate were measured (25Kon J. Sato K. Watanabe T. Tomura H. Kuwabara A. Kimura T. Tamama K. Ishizuka T. Murata N. Kanda T.

PGI2 Measurement—PGI2 levels were determined using an enzyme immunoassay kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). AoSMCs were washed once and preincubated for 20 min (PD98059 or indomethacin) at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered medium. The cells were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in HEPES/EPPS/MES-buffered medium (0.5 ml) with an appropriate pH and inhibitors. The supernatant (0.3 ml) was immediately taken up after the incubation and transferred to microtubes (1.5 ml) on ice. The amounts of PGI2 released in the supernatant were estimated as the levels of its stable metabolite 6-keto-PGF1α (27Damirin A. Tomura H. Komachi M. Tobo M. Sato K. Mogi C. Nochi H. Tamoto K.

Quantitative RT-PCR using Real-time TaqMan Technology—Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. After DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) treatment to remove possible traces of genomic DNA contaminating in the RNA preparations, 5 μg of the total RNA was reverse-transcribed using random priming and Multiscribe reverse transcriptase according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To evaluate the expression level of the OGR1, TDAG8, G2A, GPR4, and PGI2 receptor (IPR) mRNAs, quantitative RT-PCR was performed using real-time TaqMan technology with a Sequence Detection System model 7700 (Applied Biosystems). The human OGR1, GPR4, G2A, TDAG8, and IPR-specific probes were obtained from TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). The ID number of each specific probe is Hs00203431 for G2A, Hs00268858 for OGR1, Hs00269247 for TDAG8, Hs00270999 for GPR4, Hs00168765 for IPR and Hs99999905 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively. Other experimental conditions were described previously (28Yamada T. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Tobo M. Kimura T. Kuwabara A. Yanagita Y. Ikeya T. Tanahashi Y. Ogawa T. Ohwada S. Morishita Y.

The expression level of the target mRNA was normalized to the relative ratio of the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Each RT-PCR assay was performed at least three times, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Transfection of siRNA—AoSMCs were harvested from 10-cm dishes. Each siRNA (60 pmol) was introduced into AoSMCs (about 1 × 106 cells) using Human AoSMC Nucleofector kit (Amaxa Inc, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were further cultured for 4 days. The mRNA level was measured using real-time TaqMan technology as described above. The siRNA targeted for OGR1, GPR4, IPR, and non-silencing (NS) was obtained from Dharmacon Inc (Lafayette, CO). The ID number is M-005591-01 for OGR1, M-005570-01 for GPR4, M-005716-00 for IPR, and D-001206-13-05 for NS. Data Presentation—All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. The results of multiple observations are presented as the mean ± S.E. or as a representative result from more than three different batches of cells unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student's t test; values were considered significant at p < 0.05 (*). AoSMC Senses Extracellular pH, Resulting in Inositol Phosphate Production, [Ca2 +]i Increase, and cAMP Accumulation—We first examined whether acidification of an extracellular medium modulates the early signaling pathways in AoSMCs. Acidification of the extracellular medium induced a marked inositol phosphate production (Fig. 1A), which was accompanied by a transient [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 1B). The [Ca2 +]i increase was inhibited by a phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 but not by U77343, an inactive form of U73122, suggesting an involvement of phospholipase C (Fig. 1C). Cyclic AMP was also accumulated in response to the acidification of extracellular medium, as shown in Fig. 1D. In this experiment, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, was included in the assay medium, even though the cAMP response was also observed in its absence (data not shown). Thus, extracellular acidification activates phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase, although ED50 (a half-maximal concentration required for the response) was slightly lower for adenylyl cyclase (cAMP response) than for phospholipase C (inositol phosphate response) (see Fig. 1, A and D). To clarify the involvement of proton-sensing GPCRs in acid-induced actions, we examined the effect of psychosine, which was shown to selectively antagonize the proton-sensing GPCR-mediated actions (6Wang J.Q. Kon J. Mogi C. Tobo M. Damirin A. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Murata N. Kimura T. Kuwabara A. Wakamatsu K. Koizumi H. Uede T. Tsujimoto G. Kurose H. Sato T. Harada A. Misawa N. Tomura H. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45626-45633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Psychosine significantly inhibited the cAMP accumulation and inositol phosphate production (data not shown) at pH 6.8, whereas the lipid did not affect the increased acid (pH 6.5)-induced cAMP accumulation and PGI2-induced action at pH 7.6 (Fig. 1E). Thus, psychosine specifically inhibited the acid-induced action in a manner dependent on extracellular pH, as previously shown (6Wang J.Q. Kon J. Mogi C. Tobo M. Damirin A. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Murata N. Kimura T. Kuwabara A. Wakamatsu K. Koizumi H. Uede T. Tsujimoto G. Kurose H. Sato T. Harada A. Misawa N. Tomura H. Okajima F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45626-45633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These results suggest that proton-sensing GPCRs mediate the acid-induced early signaling events in AoSMCs. OGR1 Is Involved in Proton-induced Actions—Fig. 2A shows the mRNA expression patterns of OGR1, GPR4, TDAG8, and G2A, which have been reported to be proton-sensing GPCRs so far, measured by the real-time TaqMan PCR method in AoSMCs. Among them, the expression of OGR1 and GPR4 was clearly detected. In order to examine the possible roles of OGR1 and GPR4 in the proton-induced actions, we performed siRNA experiments. As shown in Fig. 2B, the siRNA specific to OGR1 decreased the OGR1 mRNA expression to about 25% of the initial level without any significant effect on GPR4 mRNA expression. Similarly, the siRNA specific to GPR4 decreased the GPR4 mRNA expression to about 40% of the initial expression without any significant effect on OGR1 expression. As shown in Fig. 2C, the proton-induced inositol phosphate production was markedly inhibited by OGR1 siRNA but not by GPR4 siRNA. As expected, the proton-induced [Ca2+]i increase was also significantly inhibited by OGR1 siRNA but not by GPR4 siRNA. Neither OGR1 siRNA nor GPR4 siRNA attenuated the S1P-induced [Ca2+]i increase at all (Fig. 2D), indicating that the inhibitory effect of OGR1 siRNA is specific to the proton actions. These results are quite consistent with the reported role of OGR1 in the phospholipase C/Ca2+ system (1Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a previous report showed that GPR4 is coupled to adenylyl cyclase (1Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). We, therefore, expected that the proton-induced cAMP accumulation might be inhibited by GPR4 siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2E, however, acidic pH-induced cAMP accumulation was inhibited about 70% by OGR1 siRNA but only about 20% by GPR4 siRNA. The effect of siRNAs was specific, as evidenced by the lack of any significant effect on S1P-induced cAMP accumulation by any siRNA treatment. This result suggests that acidic pH-induced cAMP accumulation is also mediated mainly through OGR1 and only slightly through GPR4. Intracellular Signaling Pathways of the Acid-induced cAMP Accumulation—The unexpected observation might be in part explained by the involvement of COX/prostaglandin (PG) pathways. Our recent study in CASMC showed that cAMP accumulation is associated with the production of PGs, especially PGI2, which was produced through the phospholipase C/ERK/COX pathway (27Damirin A. Tomura H. Komachi M. Tobo M. Sato K. Mogi C. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the protoninduced cAMP accumulation was almost completely inhibited by indomethacin, a COX inhibitor. In a previous CASMC study, ERK was shown to work upstream of PG production (27Damirin A. Tomura H. Komachi M. Tobo M. Sato K. Mogi C. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Consistent with this scheme, PD98059, an ERK kinase inhibitor, also inhibited the protoninduced cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3A). These inhibitors did not affect the proton-induced inositol phosphate production, indicating the specificity of these inhibitors (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that ERK-regulated and COX-catalyzed PG production is responsible for cAMP accumulation. We next examined the possible role of phospholipase C in the acidinduced activation of the PG/cAMP system. The proton-induced cAMP accumulation was inhibited by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (Fig. 3C) in association with the inhibition of inositol phosphate production (Fig. 3D), whereas the cAMP response to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol was hardly affected by the phospholipase C inhibitor (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, we found that either PMA, a protein kinase C activator, or A23187, Ca2+ ionophore, caused cAMP accumulation. These results suggest that phospholipase C activation and the subsequent [Ca 2+]i increase and protein kinase C activation may lead to the stimulation of the PG/cAMP system. OGR1 Is Involved in the Proton-induced PGI2 Production Leading to cAMP Accumulation—Among the PGs employed, PGI2 was the most potent stimulator of cAMP accumulation in AoSMCs (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, PGI2 was actually produced from the cells, depending on the extracellular pH. The PGI2 production at pH 6.5 corresponded to about 200 nm, which is a high enough concentration to increase cAMP accumulation, as shown in Fig. 4A (100 nm PGI2). The PGI2 production was almost completely inhibited by indomethacin and PD98059 (Fig. 4C), suggesting an involvement of the ERK/COX pathway (Fig. 3A). We further examined the role of OGR1 and GPR4. As expected, siRNA targeted for OGR1 but not for GPR4 specifically reduced the PGI2 production at pH 6.8, indicating that the PGI2 production is also mediated by OGR1. The involvement of PGI2 was further supported by a finding of an inhibition of acidification-induced cAMP accumulation by siRNA specific to PGI2 receptor (IPR). Thus, the IPR-specific siRNA decreased its mRNA expression to about 10% of the initial level without any significant effect on OGR1 mRNA expression (Fig. 4E). Under these conditions, the cAMP accumulation induced by acidification (pH 6.8 and pH 6.5), but not by isoproterenol, was significantly attenuated (Fig. 4F). OGR1 Does Not Seem to Mediate Ca2+ Response to SPC and LPC in AoSMCs—OGR1 and GPR4 have been reported as receptors for SPC (2Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and LPC (3Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41325-41335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We finally examined whether or not these lysolipids modulate the Ca 2+ metabolism in AoSMCs. As shown in Fig. 5, d-SPC but not l-SPC induced a [Ca 2 +]i increase, as reported previously (2Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The [Ca 2 +]i increase, however, was not attenuated by siRNA targeted for OGR1, whereas the proton-induced [Ca2+]i increase was markedly inhibited under the conditions. The [Ca2+]i increase by S1P was not attenuated by the siRNA treatment, indicating the specificity of the OGR1 siRNA (Fig. 5). LPC at 10 μm, which is a saturated concentration for the [Ca 2 +]i increase in the previous report (3Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol.

Proton-sensing GPCRs, including OGR1, GPR4, G2A, and TDAG8, have all been shown to be receptors for lysolipids and are known to be expressed in various tissues and cell types (3Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M.

However, little is known about the physiological role of another feature of these receptors, the “proton sensing.” The proton-sensing mechanism has been demonstrated by using cells that overexpressed these GPCRs. Among native cells, TDAG8 has been suggested to be involved in extracellular acidification-induced cAMP accumulation only in thymocytes so far (4Radu C.G. Nijagal A. McLaughlin J. Wang L. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6Wang J.Q. Kon J. Mogi C. Tobo M. Damirin A. Sato K. Komachi M. Malchinkhuu E. Murata N. Kimura T.

In the present study, we demonstrated that OGR1 and GPR4 are expressed in AoSMCs and that OGR1 is responsible for extracellular proton-induced PGI2 production and cAMP accumulation in cells. This finding suggests that the protonsensing mechanism actually plays a role in a wide area of biological systems in native cells. OGR1 and GPR4 have also been shown to be receptors for SPC (2Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and LPC (3Zhu K. Baudhuin L.M. Hong G. Williams F.S. Cristina K.L. Kabarowski J.H. Witte O.N. Xu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41325-41335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We detected a [Ca2+]i increase by d-SPC, as described previously (2Xu Y. Zhu K. Hong G. Wu W. Baudhuin L.M. Xiao Y. Damron D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas LPC was ineffective (Fig. 5). The [Ca 2+]i increase by d-SPC, however, was not inhibited by siRNA targeted for OGR1 under conditions in which the proton-induced actions were largely inhibited (Fig. 5). Thus, the [Ca2+]i increase byd-SPC is unlikely mediated by OGR1 in AoSMCs and, rather, may be mediated by S1P receptors (37Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Himmel H.M. Jakobs K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Supporting this, S1P strongly increased [Ca2+]i in a manner insusceptible to OGR1 siRNA. OGR1 and GPR4 have been shown to be coupled to the phospholipase C/Ca2+ and adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathways, respectively (1Ludwig M.G. Vanek M. Guerini D. Gasser J.A. Jones C.E. Junker U. Hofstetter H. Wolf R.M. Seuwen K. Nature. 2003; 425: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Although mRNA expression does not always reflect the protein expression, mRNA expression data suggested that GPR4 is expressed to a similar extent to OGR1 in AoSMCs (Fig. 2A). We, therefore, expected that cAMP accumulation in response to extracellular acidification might be mediated by GPR4 rather than OGR1. A small interfering RNA technique, however, revealed that OGR1 is a major receptor responsible for the acid-induced cAMP accumulation and the contribution of GPR4 is very small (Fig. 2E). Our results showed that cAMP was indirectly accumulated through COX/PGs (at least PGI2) production, and the resultant activation of adenylyl cyclase. At present, the marginal contribution of GPR4 in the cAMP accumulation in AoSMCs remains unknown. It should be noted, however, that GPR4 coupling to the adenylyl cyclase system has been demonstrated as yet only in a cell system overexpressed with GPR4. In the present study, we have not characterized in detail the mechanisms underlying OGR1 receptor-mediated PGI2 production. However, we speculate that cAMP is accumulated via the phospholipase C/ERK/phospholipase A2/COX/PGI2 pathway in a similar way to that observed in CASMCs (27Damirin A. Tomura H. Komachi M. Tobo M. Sato K. Mogi C. Nochi H. Tamoto K. Okajima F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1177-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In CASMCs, the S1P receptor activation of phospholipase C induced the activation of ERK and phospholipase A2 and, thereby, stimulated the subsequent production of arachidonic acid, which was metabolized to PGI2 by COX and PGI2 synthase. In fact, in AoSMCs as well, acid-induced cAMP accumulation was inhibited by the specific inhibitors for phospholipase C, ERK kinase, and COX. We also found that Ca2+ ionophore and PMA induced cAMP accumulation, supporting the role of phospholipase C; however, on the basis of the results of the PMA effect, any conclusion of the participation of protein kinase C should be made with caution. More experiments are needed to clarify the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the acid-induced PG synthesis in AoSMCs. It is well known that acidosis may cause vasodilation of systemic circulation, while pulmonary arteries are resistant to the vasodilator effect of extracellular acidosis (15Hyvelin J.M. O'Connor C. McLoughlin P. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: L673-L684Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both extracellular pH and intracellular pH seem to be responsible for acid-induced vasodilation of systemic circulation (15Hyvelin J.M. O'Connor C. McLoughlin P. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2004; 287: L673-L684Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 39Rosenblum W.I. Stroke. 2003; 34: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed an important role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in acid-induced vasodilation (39Rosenblum W.I. Stroke. 2003; 34: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Intracellular histidine residues have been suggested to play a role in the activation of the channel in response to intracellular acidosis (40Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Wu J. Giwa L.R. Abdulkadir L. Sharma P. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12898-12902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The potassium channel activation and the consequent hyperpolarization may cause the inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and reduction of [Ca2+]i. Thus, potassium channel inhibition is thought to be one of the mechanisms of the intracellular pH effect on vasodilation. On the other hand, the mechanism by which extracellular pH induces the relaxation of vascular SMC remains unclear. Proton-sensing GPCRs could be one of the missing players in this process. The acid-induced [Ca2+]i increase appears unfavorable for the relaxation of vascular SMC. However, careful consultation of the previous literature showed that extracellular acidification is sometimes associated with a transient vasoconstriction followed by a sustained vasorelaxation (41Krampetz I.K. Rhoades R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: L516-L521PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a transient [Ca2+]i increase has been reported in response to extracellular acidification (21Batlle D.C. Peces R. LaPointe M.S. Ye M. Daugirdas J.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C932-C943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a transient [Ca2+]i increase might be responsible for opening the Ca2+-activated potassium channel and, thereby, might induce hyperpolarization (16Hayabuchi Y. Nakaya Y. Matsuoka S. Kuroda Y. Pflugers. Arch. 1998; 436: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well known that PGI2 and its stable derivatives, such as beraprost, through cAMP accumulation, induce the relaxation of human uterine arteries (42Kimura T. Okamura T. Yoshida Y. Toda N. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, OGR1-mediated PGI2 production and the resultant cAMP accumulation might be involved in vasodilation. In addition, in vascular SMC, an increase in intracellular cAMP has been shown to be inhibitory for proliferation and migration (43Klemm D.J. Watson P.A. Frid M.G. Dempsey E.C. Schaack J. Colton L.A. Nesterova A. Stenmark K.R. Reusch J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46132-46141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, PGI2 is a potent inhibitor for platelet aggregation (44Fitzgerald G.A. Catella F. Oates J.A. Hum. Pathol. 1987; 18: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the proton/OGR1-mediated stimulation of PGI2/cAMP system is a novel vasodilation and anti-atherogenic mechanism. In vascular walls under the states of vasoconstriction and inflammation-associated neointima formation, the extracellular or interstitial pH may be decreased because of the high production of lactic acid. Thus, OGR1 activation in response to acidic circumstances may be considered to counteract vasoconstriction and inflammation. Elucidating the role of proton-sensing GPCRs, especially OGR1, in vascular SMCs, will provide not only a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms of vascular systems but also a novel potential target for vascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2109706205,"Siah1 is the central component of a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets β-catenin for destruction in response to p53 activation. The E3 complex comprises, in addition to Siah1, Siah-interacting protein (SIP), the adaptor protein Skp1, and the F-box protein Ebi. Here we show that SIP engages Siah1 by means of two elements, both of which are required for mediating β-catenin destruction in cells. An N-terminal dimerization domain of SIP sits across the saddle-shaped upper surface of Siah1, with two extended legs packing against the sides of Siah1 by means of a consensus PXAXVXP motif that is common to a family of Siah-binding proteins. The C-terminal domain of SIP, which binds to Skp1, protrudes from the lower surface of Siah1, and we propose that this surface provides the scaffold for bringing substrate and the E2 enzyme into apposition in the functional complex.

In addition, Siah interacts with adenomatous polyposis coli, a tumor suppressor involved in colon cancers (26Liu J. Stevens J. Hu Y. Neufeld K.L. White R. Matsunami N. Mol.

Nukina N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, Sina/Siah does not appear to target phyllopod, adenomatous polyposis coli, VAV, BAG-1, or Dab-1 for polyubiquitination and degradation. Thus, not all Siah-binding proteins are targets of Siah-mediated degradation. Recently, we discovered a novel pathway for β-catenin degradation involving a complex formed by Siah1, SIP, the adaptor protein Skp1 that is common to the SCF complex, and the F-box protein Ebi that binds β-catenin independent of phosphorylation (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Siah1 expression is up-regulated by p53, revealing a link between genotoxic injury and destruction of β-catenin, reduced Tcf/LEF activity, and cell cycle arrest (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Siah1 is a dimeric protein that contains an N-terminal RING domain (an E2 binding domain) followed by two zinc finger motifs and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The crystal structure of a major fragment of Siah1a lacking the RING domain (Siah1ΔR) has been determined (32Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); in this structure, the first zinc finger is highly mobile, whereas the second packs tightly against the C-terminal domain, forming a dimeric substrate-binding domain. In the multiprotein E3 complex, Siah1 plays an analogous role to the cullin-1 and Rbx1 domains in the classic SCF complex, and Siah-interacting protein (SIP) provides a novel link between Siah1 and Skp1 (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). We previously showed that SIP binds to Siah1 via determinants in its N-terminal domains (residues 1-72), whereas its C terminus (residues 73-228) binds to Skp1 (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The murine ortholog of SIP (which is 93% identical) was initially characterized as a calcyclin-binding protein (33Filipek A. Wojda U. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Filipek A. Kuznicki J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Calcyclin binding does not appear to compete with Skp1 binding, and its functional role has not been determined. A consensus motif for Siah-binding proteins, comprising the sequence PXAXVXP, has been identified (35House C.M. Frew I.J. Huang H.L. Wiche G. Traficante N. Nice E. Catimel B. Bowtell D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This motif is present in 15 of 27 known, functionally diverse, Siah-binding proteins, some of which are targets of degradation. The motif is also present in SIP. Here we present a structural and functional characterization of the interaction between human Siah1 and SIP. Our work demonstrates how SIP interacts with Siah1 in the context of the multiprotein complex. It also provides the first structure of Siah1 bound to the consensus PXAXVXP motif, providing a basis for probing a broad range of Siah functions. Protein Expression and Purification—Human SIP-S-(1-80), SIP-(1-47), and Siah1ΔR-(81-282) were cloned into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET15b (Novagen) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as N-terminal His tag fusion proteins. Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C and induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After recovery from the soluble fraction of the cell extract, SIP-S was purified by Zn2+ or Ni2+ chelating affinity chromatography (Amersham Bio-sciences), followed by removal of the histidine tag with thrombin (Sigma) and molecular sizing (Superdex 200 10/30; Amersham Bio-sciences). Typical yields were 25-30 mg/liter. SIP-(1-47) was purified using a similar protocol with yields of 40-50 mg/liter. For NMR studies, isotopically enriched SIP-S and SIP-(1-47) were expressed in the appropriate minimal media and purified according to the same protocol. Siah1ΔR was purified similarly, except that trypsin was used to remove the histidine tag. This digestion also removed nine native residues at the N terminus of Siah1, resulting in a shorter fragment comprising residues 90-282. The final yield was 2-3 mg/liter. All proteins were dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol (10 mm dithiothreitol for Siah1), concentrated to 100-200 mg/ml (SIP) or 15-25 mg/ml (Siah1), and incubated with 0.02% 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride for 1 h at room temperature prior to storage at -80 °C. Crystallization and Structure Solution of SIP-(1-47)—SIP-(1-47) was crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion. The protein at 25-35 mg/ml in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA was equilibrated at room temperature with a reservoir consisting of 2 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m CAPS, pH 10.5, 0.2 m Li2SO4. Crystals grew to a typical size of 100 × 100 × 300 μm3 in 4-8 months in space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions a = 58.8, b = 152.5, c = 37.0 Å and soaked in a cryoprotectant buffer (2.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm CAPS, pH 10.5, 100 mm Li2SO4, 20% glycerol) prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. A data set to 1.2 Å resolution (TABLE I) was collected at 100 K at the SSRL facility beamline 9.1 and processed with the HKL package (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion using a crystal soaked for 30 s in cryoprotectant solution saturated with NaBr. A four-wavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set (TABLE I) was collected at beamline 9.2 to a resolution of 1.5 Å. Initial phases were obtained with SOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), and the density was improved with ACORN (38Foadi J. Woolfson M.M. Dodson E.J. Wilson K.S. Jia-xing Y. Chao-de Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and DM (39Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). A main-chain model was built with ARP/wARP (40Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Manual model adjustments using O (41Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) to Rwork = 17.4, Rfree = 19.8 yielded the final model (TABLE I). The model contains three polypeptide chains per asymmetric unit; chains A and B form a noncrystallographic dimer, whereas C forms a dimer across a crystallographic dyad. The model includes residues 1-43 for chains A and C and 1-47 for chain B, 230 water molecules, one SO42- ion, one CAPS molecule, and one or two nonnative N-terminal residues. The stereochemistry is excellent as judged by PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Crystallization and Structure Solution of Siah1ΔR/SIP-(58-70)—Synthetic peptides (DNEKPAAVVAP-NH2 and EKPAAVVAPITTG-NH2) were purchased at 95% purity from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Core Laboratories. Siah1-(90-282) was mixed at 6 mg/ml in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, with 1 mm peptide and crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion. The reservoir solution was 1.4 m NaH2PO4/K2HPO4 in a 9:1 to 8:2 ratio, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals appeared in 3-5 days, growing to a typical size of 150 × 150 × 400 μm3. They adopt space group C2221 with unit cell dimensions a = 47.7, b = 107.7, c = 78.3 Å. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen using the crystallization solution with 20% glycerol. A complete data set to 2.2 Å resolution (TABLE I) was collected on a Rigaku FR-E generator equipped with Osmic optics and an R-axis IV image plate detector and processed with the HKL package (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using residues 150-282 of a Siah1 monomeric subunit (Protein Data Bank code 1k2f) as a search model using MOLREP (39Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out using Refmac5 (42Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Electron density for seven residues in the peptide (PAAVVAP) was clearly visible in 2 Fo - Fc maps in the early stages of the refinement, and the refined model is fully consistent with density in a 5000 °C simulated annealing omit map. The final model (Rwork = 0.215, Rfree = 0.254; see TABLE I) consists of Siah1 residues 125-282, SIP residues 59-67 (KPAAVVAPI), one Zn2+ ion, and 100 water molecules. Electron density for residues in turns 132-133, 172-175, and 197-202 was weak and is not included in the model. No electron density was observed for residues 90-124. Residues 162-282 superpose with the corresponding residues in the Siah1 probe model with a root mean square deviation (Cα) of 0.46 Å. All stereochemical parameters are excellent as analyzed with PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Coordinates and structure factors of Siah1ΔR/SIP-(58-70) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with code 2A25. NMR Measurements—Sequential assignments of SIP-(1-47) were obtained with standard techniques using appropriately labeled SIP-(1-47) at 0.5-2 mm and pH 5.1. All two- and three-dimensional spectra used for resonance assignments were recorded on a Varian UNITY PLUS 500-MHz spectrometer and processed and analyzed using FELIX (Accelrys Inc.). Sequential resonances for residues 4-47 were unambiguously assigned and have been deposited in the BioMagnRes data bank. All other spectra were collected at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance probe and z axis pulsed field gradients. 1H,15N HSQC and transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) spectra were recorded with 2048 (HN)*128 or *256 (15N) data points and a total of 4 or 16 transients per t1 increment. Proton and nitrogen spectral widths were set to 12 and 26 ppm, respectively. Spectra were recorded on a sample of 500 μm uniformly 15N/2H-labeled SIP-S in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate buffer H2O/D2O (90:10) pH 6.7, 10 μm Zn(OAc)2. 13C HMQC experiments were acquired in the same buffer on a sample of 13Cγ,1Hγ-Thr, 13Cδ1, 1Hδ1-Ile, 2H-labeled SIP-S (200 μm) in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled Siah1ΔR protein. 13C,1H HMQC spectra were recorded as 8192*150 data points with 8 transients per t1 increment; proton and carbon spectral widths were set to 12 and 20 ppm, respectively. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra were acquired with mixing times of 150 and 200 ms (spectral width 12 ppm along both f1 and f2, 4096*320 data points in t2 and t1, respectively, and 80 scans per t1 increment). Water suppression was achieved by the WATERGATE PFG technique. All spectra were processed with Bruker software (Xwinnmr 3.5) and analyzed with XEASY version 1.3.13 (45Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) and Mestrec (available on the World Wide Web at qobrue.usc.es/). For Kd evaluation, normalized intensities from] 13C,1H HMQC spectra were plotted as a function of Siah1 concentration (10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 μm). Normalized intensities were evaluated according to the relationship Ifree - Iobs/Isat - Ifree, where Iobs is the measured value of the intensity, Ifree is the value in the absence of Siah1, and Isat is the value at saturation (400 μm Siah1). Intensities were evaluated as average values of the observed peaks with the errors set to the S.D., using XEASY (45Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Data were fitted to the equation, Y = ((X + B + A) - √((X + A + B)2 - 4XB))/(2B), where B represents the concentration of SIP-S (200 μm), and A is the Kd obtained from the fit. Docking—AutoDock version 3.0.5 (46Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar) was used for the docking simulation. We used the Lamarckian genetic algorithm for SIP-(1-47) positional searching. The protonation states of Siah1 and SIP were set to pH 7.4. SIP-(1-47) domain was kept as a rigid body. The docking parameters were as follows: trials of 100 dockings, population size of 150, random starting position and conformation, translation step ranges of 1.5 Å, rotation step ranges of 35°, elitism of 1, mutation rate of 0.02, cross-over rate of 0.8, local search rate of 0.06, and 10 million energy evaluations. Final docked conformations were clustered using a tolerance of 1.5 Å root mean square deviation. Plasmids, Transfections, and Cell Culture—Mutations in SIP were generated by two-step PCR-based mutagenesis using a full-length human SIP cDNA (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) as a template. Products were purified by Qia-Quick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and then directly subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal Myc epitope tag (MEQKLI-SEEDL), thus creating pcDNA3-Myc. Alternatively, the cDNAs were subcloned into yeast two-hybrid plasmids pGilda and pJG4-5, which produce fusion proteins with a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 transcription activation domain, respectively, at the N terminus, under the control of a GAL1 promoter. HEK293T cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient transfections, cells (∼5 × 105) in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmid DNAs using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast EGY191 strain was cotransformed with pGilda plasmids encoding Lex A DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, pJG4-5 plasmids encoding B42 transactivation domain fusion protein, and β-galactosidase reporter plasmids (pRB1840) as previously described (28Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—SIP-S and Siah1ΔR were extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 μm Zn(OAc)2 with or without 10 mm MgCl2 and concentrated to 1.20-2.90 mm and 100-115 μm, respectively. 7-15-μl aliquots of SIP-S were added to the initial 2 ml of Siah1 in the cell of a Microcal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC. Values for Kd, ΔH, and ΔS were calculated using the Microcal Origin software provided by the manufacturer. For each titration point, the heat of reaction was plotted against the molar ratio, and the data were fitted as described (47Freire E. Mayogra O.L. Straume M. Anal. Chem. 1990; 62: 950A-959ACrossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The SIP-S concentration and SIP-S/Siah1 molar ratio at the end point of the titration were at least 210 μm and 4.2, respectively. Each measurement was performed independently in duplicate and was reproducible within a 4% error margin (Kd). SIP-S Comprises an N-terminal Dimer with a Pair of Widely Separated Flexible Tails—The gene for human SIP encodes two alternatively spliced proteins 228 and 80 amino acids long, called SIP and SIP-S (S for short) (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). SIP-S is identical to SIP in its first 72 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Using NMR techniques, we probed the structure of SIP-S and obtained sequential assignments for residues 4-47. The chemical shifts and the NOE patterns are consistent with a folded domain with α-helical structure. The remaining residues of SIP-S were not assigned, due to overlapping resonances at typical random coil values and the lack of sequential NOEs, suggesting that the tail is disordered. Attempts to crystallize full-length SIP or SIP-S were unsuccessful. Limited proteolysis identified a protease-resistant core (residues 4-43), consistent with the NMR data, and we made a new construct encoding SIP residues 1-47 that crystallized and diffracted X-rays to high resolution. We solved the crystal structure of SIP-(1-47) at 1.2 Å resolution (Fig. 1, TABLE I). The protein is dimeric, as expected based on our previous biophysical and biochemical studies (31Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). There are two independent copies of the dimer within the crystal lattice with essentially identical structure. The dimer forms a curved cylinder, ∼50 Å long with a maximum diameter of ∼20 Å. Each monomeric subunit forms a helical hairpin in which the two helices, α1 (residues 2-20) and α2 (residues 24-47), are connected by a tight 3-residue turn. Hairpins from two monomers associate as a four-helix bundle (Fig. 1, C and D), with the two C termini at opposite ends of the cylinder, 50 Å apart. The bundle is stabilized by a hydrophobic core across 2-fold the axis that includes hydrophobic residues (Val13, Leu16, Val25, and Leu29) from each chain; further stability arises from a number of surface-exposed salt bridges, burying a total of 1700 Å2.

Recent evidence suggests that this protein also participates in cell response to various growth factors and cytokines, influencing myeloid differentiation, tumor growth, and the antiviral activity of interferon. Whereas plasma membrane PLSCR1 was shown to be required for normal recruitment and activation of Src kinase by stimulated cell surface growth factor receptors, PLSCR1 was also found to traffic into the nucleus and to tightly bind to genomic DNA, suggesting a possible additional nuclear function. We now report evidence that PLSCR1 directly binds to the 5′-promoter region of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 1 gene (IP3R1) to enhance expression of the receptor. Probing a CpG island genomic library with PLSCR1 as bait identified four clones with avidity for PLSCR1, including a 191-bp fragment of the IP3R1 promoter. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and transcription reporter assays, the PLSCR1-binding site in IP3R1 was mapped to residues -101GTAACCATGTGGA-89, and the segment spanning Met86-Glu118 in PLSCR1 was identified to mediate its transcriptional activity. The significance of this interaction between PLSCR1 and IP3R1 in situ was confirmed by comparing levels of IP3R1 mRNA and protein in matched cells that either expressed or were deficient in PLSCR1. These data suggest that in addition to its role at the plasma membrane, effects of PLSCR1 on cell proliferative and maturational responses may also relate to alterations in expression of cellular IP3 receptors.

Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The first identified member of this family (PLSCR1) was isolated based upon its capacity to promote Ca2+-dependent accelerated transbilayer membrane phospholipid (PL) movement, mimicking the remodeling of plasma membrane PL that is observed under conditions of injury and apoptosis (2Bassé F.

PLSCR1 is a multiply palmitoylated, Ca2+-binding, Pro- and Cys-rich, endofacial plasma membrane protein that was shown to distribute into lipid raft domains and to be a substrate of the Abl and Src tyrosine kinases (4Nanjundan M.

The exact biologic function of this protein remains controversial; although PLSCR1 mediates Ca2+-dependent transbilayer movement of PL in proteoliposomes (2Bassé F. Stout J.G. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T.

Whereas its role in plasma membrane PL movement remains unresolved, there is increasing evidence that PLSCR1 serves to regulate cellular maturation and proliferative responses; mutation in PLSCR1 was shown to influence the leukemic potential of the murine monocyte cell line MM, whereas gene deletion of PLSCR1 or inhibition of PLSCR1 protein expression using antisense or small interfering RNA was found to impair myeloid cell maturation or proliferation in response to select hematopoietic growth factors (12Zhou Q.

PLSCR1, a potently stimulated interferon (IFN)-responsive gene, was also found to be required for normal expression of the antiviral activity of IFN, whereas PLSCR1 gene deletion and small interfering RNA suppression of PLSCR1 expression were found to inhibit the expression of a select subset of IFN-stimulated genes, including those with known antiviral activity (17Dong B.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PLSCR1 influences cell response to these various growth factors and cytokines remains unresolved. In the case of epidermal growth factor receptor, PLSCR1 was shown to be recruited into the activated plasma membrane epidermal growth factor receptor complex, concomitant with the phosphorylation of PLSCR1 by activated Src and its binding to the phosphotyrosine domain of the adapter Shc (4Nanjundan M. Sun J. Zhao J. Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 39: 37413-37418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Gene deletion of PLSCR1, or mutation of its Tyr residues that are phosphorylated by Src, prevented this interaction and was accompanied by attenuated growth factor-induced activation of Src kinase, implying a role for PLSCR1 in Src recruitment and feedback activation of the kinase by activated epidermal growth factor receptor. Similar interactions were also observed with related growth factor receptors. Despite the considerable evidence that PLSCR1 is an endofacial cell surface protein with apparent biologic function at the plasma membrane, recent data suggest an additional role for this protein in the nucleus. Nuclear trafficking of PLSCR1 has been observed only in circumstances where its cellular expression was induced by IFN and other cytokines or growth factors that transcriptionally activate this gene, implying nuclear import of de novo synthesized PLSCR1 rather than a redistribution of the membrane-bound pool (19Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Nanjundan M. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutation of PLSCR1 at its sites of Cys palmitoylation or inhibition of palmitoylation by cell treatment with bromo-palmitate also resulted in nuclear trafficking of the protein and abrogated its distribution to the cell surface. Nuclear import of PLSCR1 was shown to be mediated by the importin nucleopore transport chaperones and to be dependent on specific binding of PLSCR1 to importin-α via an unconventional nuclear localization signal identified within the PLSCR1 polypeptide (20Ben-Efraim I. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Gerace L. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PLSCR1 was also found to bind directly to genomic DNA, and after nuclear uptake, its extraction from the nucleus required salt elution or incubation with DNase, implying interaction with chromatin. To gain insight into the possible function of nuclear PLSCR1, we utilized genomic binding site cloning (GBSC) from a human CpG island-enriched library to identify potential gene regulatory regions to which PLSCR1 might bind. Our data suggest that PLSCR1 specifically binds to a segment of the 5′-promoter of IP3R1, enhances transcription of this gene, and is required for normal expression of cell IP3R1 protein. PLSCR1 Protein Preparation—Human PLSCR1-GST and PLSCR1-MBP fusion proteins were prepared as described before (3Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Sun J. Zhao J. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28984-28990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, PLSCR1 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences) and pMAL-C2X vector (New England Biolabs). PLSCR1-GST and PLSCR1-MBP fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and amylose-Sepharose 4B (New England Biolabs), respectively. Preparation of CpG Island Genomic Library DNA—Human CpG island genomic library in E. coli (UK HGMP Resource Center) was amplified in 0.3% low melting agarose-LB medium, and the DNA was purified with a Qiagen column. Genomic DNA inserts (average size, 760 bp) were amplified by PCR for 30 cycles using the primers 5′-CGG CCG CCT GCA GGT CGA CCT TAA-3′ and 5′-AAC GCG TTG GGA GCT CTC CCT TAA-3′ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplified genomic DNA was purified by phenol extraction. Genomic DNA-binding Site Cloning—PCR-amplified CpG library genomic DNA was precleaned by incubation of 25 μg of DNA with 250 μl of GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GST-Sepharose) and 400 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleaned genomic DNA was incubated with 21 μl (10 μg of protein) of either PLSCR1-GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (PLSCR1-GST-Sepharose) or control GST-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. The beads were washed five times with binding buffer and suspended in 300 μl of PCR buffer (BD Clontech). Bound genomic DNA was amplified by PCR for 25 cycles (denaturing for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 0.5 min, and extension for 1.5 min at 68 °C) with Advantage DNA polymerase and the primers noted above. PCR products were purified by phenol extraction and used in the next cycle of GBSC. After seven cycles of GBSC, enriched genomic DNA was separated on agarose gel and cloned into Topo-pCR2.1 T-A cloning vector (Invitrogen), and the inserts were sequenced. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Genomic DNA fragments from GBSC were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Three μl of 32P-labeled DNA (3 × 105 cpm) were mixed with 19 μl of EMSA binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) and 3 μl of either human PLSCR1-MBP (1.2 μg) or MBP (1.2 μg). After incubation for 45 min at 4 °C, PLSCR1-complexed 32P-DNA probe was separated from free 32P-DNA probe on a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) and detected by exposure to x-ray film (Kodak). Mapping Gene Transcriptional Activation Domain in PLSCR1—Full-length PLSCR1 cDNA (Met1-Trp318) or its serial deletions (Met86-Trp318, Val119-Trp318, Arg177-Trp318, and Pro212-Trp318) were cloned into pAS2-1 vector (BD Clontech) to encode fusion proteins with Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Yeast was transformed with either full-length PLSCR1-pAS2-1 or the PLSCR1 deletions or pAS2-1 vector control, and cultured on agar plates. Yeast colonies were transferred to filter paper, and expression of β-galactosidase under the control of Gal4-responsive elements was detected with X-GAL as substrate. Colonies were imaged using Kodak Image Station 440 CF (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PLSCR1- and PLSCR3-deficient Mice and Cell Lines—PLSCR1-/- and PLSCR3-/- mice were produced by Lexicon Genetics Incorporated (The Woodlands, TX) as previously described (12Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T.

Embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and kidney epithelial cells (KEC) from PLSCR1-/- and PLSCR1(1&3)-/- mice were immortalized with SV40 and cloned as previously described (4Nanjundan M. Sun J. Zhao J.

Clonal cell lines were then infected with the murine stem cell virus containing either MSCV-IRES-GFP (vector control) or the following MSCV-PLSCR1-IRES-GFP constructs: wild type PLSCR1; PLSCR1 184CCCPCC189 → 184AAAPAA189 (PLSCR1-C→A), a nuclear trafficking PLSCR1 construct in which plasma membrane attachment is prevented by mutation of all palmitoylated residues; the PLSCR1 double mutant control 184CCCPCC189 → 184AAAPAA189, 257GKISKHWTGI266 → 257GAISAAWTGI266 (PLSCR1-C→A&K→A), in which plasma membrane attachment as well as nuclear trafficking are prevented by mutation of both the palmitoylated residues and the nuclear localization signal in PLSCR1 (19Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Nanjundan M. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Ben-Efraim I. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Gerace L. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Prior to use, the cells were sorted by flow cytometry to achieve comparable GFP expression. Cell Culture and Treatment—Sorted MEF were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and KEC in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 (1:1), 10% fetal bovine serum. In some cases, the cells were treated with or without 2 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) (Sigma) for 24 h and harvested to measure gene expression by Northern and Western blots as described below. Transcriptional Activity Assay—PLSCR1 or PLSCR1-C→A (184CCCPCC189 → 184AAAPAA189) mutant were cloned into pcDNA3, and GBSC-derived IP3R1 genomic DNA was cloned into pGL3 (Promega). Immortalized PLSCR(1&3)-/- MEF were co-transfected with 1.4 μg of pcDNA3-PLSCR1 or pcDNA3-PLSCR1-C→A (184CCCPCC189 → 184AAAPAA189) mutant, 0.1 μg of pGL3-GBSC-derived genomic DNA, and 0.1 μg of PRL-TK (Promega) for calibration of transfection efficiency, using the Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was assayed with the dual luciferase system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega) by automated injection using a MicroLumatPlus microplate luminometer (EG&G Berthold). This was followed by measurement of the Renilla luciferase activity (Promega). Relative luciferase activity is presented as a ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. Alternatively, transfection efficiency was determined by co-transfection with pEGFP-C3. Forty-eight hours post-transfection luciferase activity was measured using Bright glow reagent (Promega) in a MicroLumatPlus microplate luminometer, and GFP fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The results are shown as ratios of luciferase to GFP values. Northern Blot—Total RNA in MEF was purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Eight μg of total RNA in 30 μl RNA sample buffer were loaded onto a 1% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel. After electrophoresis the RNA was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion) and hybridized with either 32P-labeled IP3R1 cDNA probe (1074 bp, from 2021 to 3094, GenBank™ accession number NM_010585.2) or 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe (982 bp, from 79 to 1060, GenBank™ accession number NM_001001978.1), respectively. The membrane was washed and exposed to x-ray film. The intensity of each band was then quantified by densitometry using a Kodak Image Station 440CF (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with background correction. Variation in mRNA loading was corrected by normalization to the band intensity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Western Blot—Mouse primary bone marrow cells, MEF, and KEC were incubated for 1 h at 4°C in cell lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Brain tissue was isolated from either WT or PLSCR1-/- mice and homogenized in 10 volumes of cell lysis buffer, kept at 4 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The proteins were resolved on a 4-20% gradient Tris-glycine gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% Blotto, immunoblotting was performed using rabbit anti-IP3R1 (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), goat anti-IP3R2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-IP3R3 (BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-PLSCR1 monoclonal antibody 4D2 (human PLSCR1) or 1A8 (mouse PLSCR1) (11Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al Zoghaibi F. Zhou A.M. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Blood. 2002; 99: 4030-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies, respectively. Following development with the appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-globulin antibodies and SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce), the bands were visualized on x-ray film. The intensity of each band was then quantified by densitometry using a Kodak Image Station 440CF (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with background correction. Variation in protein loading was corrected by normalization to the band intensity of β-actin. Identification of PLSCR1-binding DNA—Because PLSCR1 was shown to be actively imported into the nucleus and to avidly bind genomic DNA, we sought to identify candidate DNA sequences that bound PLSCR1 within a CpG island-enriched human genomic library. Seven rounds of panning and amplification against this library using GST-PLSCR1 as bait yielded four distinct clones that bound to PLSCR1 (Fig. 1): three with inserts that corresponded to sequence derived from uncharacterized genes and one with a sequence from the 5′ regulatory region of IP3R1 (residues -112 to +79, of Ensembl sequence ENST00000302640 at www.ensembl.org). The specificity of the clones that were isolated on GST-PLSCR1 for binding to PLSCR1 was confirmed by performing EMSA against MBP-PLSCR1. As shown in Fig. 1, a shift in mobility was observed for all four clones in the presence of MBP-PLSCR1 but not in the presence of MBP alone. Identification of a Gene Transcriptional Activation Domain in PLSCR1—Next we used a yeast Gal4-LacZ reporter system to examine whether PLSCR1 contains a transcriptional activation domain. When PLSCR1 was expressed as a fusion protein with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, transcriptional activity as detected by β-galactosidase gene expression was observed, in absence of a “bait” library containing the requisite transcription activation domain for the LacZ reporter. As expected, expression of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain alone did not activate transcription (Fig. 2). This suggested that PLSCR1 directly activated the minimal promoter of LacZ or interacted with an intrinsic factor in the reporter cell with such an activation domain. Expression of a series of truncated mutants of PLSCR1 revealed that PLSCR1-dependent transcriptional activity was lost upon truncation between residues Met86 and Glu118, locating a putative transcriptional activation domain to this 33-amino acid segment within PLSCR1. PLSCR1 Promotes IP3R1 Gene Transcription—Having demonstrated specific binding of PLSCR1 to DNA sequences identified by GBSC and having located a putative transcription activation domain within PLSCR1, we next investigated the effect of PLSCR1 on gene transcription in a mammalian cell line. For these experiments, the DNA inserts of the four GBSC-derived clones were cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3. Because the PLSCR1 protein sequence is highly homologous to PLSCR3 and shows similar tissue distribution, a cell line deficient in both PLSCR1 and PLSCR3 (PLSCR(1&3)-/- MEF) was selected for these experiments to analyze the transcriptional activity of PLSCR1 without potential interference by PLSCR3. As shown in Fig. 3A, of the four GBSC-derived clones that bound PLSCR1 (from Fig. 1), only GBSC clone 3 (representing nucleotides -112 to +79 of the IP3R1 promoter region) was found to activate luciferase gene expression of the pGL3 reporter when co-transfected with PLSCR1. This activation of the IP3R1 (-112 to +79)-pGL3 reporter construct by PLSCR1 was observed for both the wild type protein and for the PLSCR1-C→ A mutant, which localizes preferentially to the nucleus (Fig. 3B). To identify the sequence in the IP3R1 promoter region required for the observed PLSCR1-mediated gene transcription, pGL3 luciferase reporter constructs containing the full-length or serial deletions of the IP3R1 promoter region (-112 to +79) were transfected into PLSCR(1&3)-/- MEF for evaluation of gene transcription activity. As shown in Fig. 4, truncation of 33 bp from the 5′ end (construct -79 to +79) resulted in the loss of >90% of transcriptional activity, suggesting that the sequence from -112 to -80 of the IP3R1 promoter region was primarily responsible for the observed PLSCR1-enhanced reporter gene transcription. However, a pGL3 luciferase reporter construct containing nucleotides -112 to -80 exhibited <10% of the transcriptional activity of the full-length construct, indicating an additional contribution by sequence contained within nucleotides -79 to +79. To identify the binding site for PLSCR1 within the IP3R1 promoter region, full-length and the partial IP3R1 promoter sequences were subjected to EMSA with PLSCR1. Only full-length (-112 to + 79) and the sequence from -112 to -80 were observed to bind to PLSCR1, locating the binding site to this 33-bp sequence (not shown). The binding site for PLSCR1 within this sequence was further delineated by performing EMSA with PLSCR1 of serial mutations of this 33-bp segment (Fig. 5). These experiments mapped the minimal binding site for PLSCR1 to 13 nucleotides (-101GTAACCATGTGGA-89) of the IP3R1 promoter region. This 13-bp sequence containing the PLSCR1-binding site in human IP3R1 is identically conserved in mouse IP3R1.FIGURE 5Mapping of PLSCR1-binding site in IP3R1 gene promoter region. A, serial mutations of the 33-bp segment of the IP3R1 promoter (-112 to -80) were prepared, and their binding to PLSCR1 was assessed by EMSA. WT nucleotides are indicated in black, and mutated nucleotides are in gray. Sequences conferring binding of PLSCR1 are underlined with black. B, EMSA reveals specific binding of MBP-PLSCR1 to minimal consensus 13-nucleotide sequence of mutant T (-101 to -89). Also shown is EMSA for full-length WT and nonbinding mutant U nucleotides. The data of a single experiment are shown, representative of three so performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we examined the effect of PLSCR1 on cellular IP3R1 gene expression in situ. IP3R1 is constitutively expressed in many mammalian cells, and its expression has been shown to increase in cells treated with retinoic acid. In these experiments, PLSCR(1&3)-/- MEF stably transfected with wild type, mutant PLSCR1-C→ A, or vector control were subjected to Northern blotting for IP3R1 mRNA and Western blotting for IP3R1 protein. As shown in Fig. 6, when compared with the vector only controls, cells expressing the nuclear localized PLSCR1 mutant (PLSCR1-C→ A) exhibited >2-fold increase in expression of IP3R1 mRNA (Fig. 6A) and protein (Fig. 6B) under both basal and ATRA-stimulated conditions. Ectopic expression of wild type PLSCR1, which is normally palmitoylated and predominantly distributes to plasma membrane and not to nucleus (19Wiedmer T. Zhao J. Nanjundan M. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), resulted in only small and variable changes in either basal or ATRA-stimulated expression of IP3R1. By contrast to the observed elevation in IP3R1 expression in cells expressing the nuclear trafficking PLSCR1 mutant, we detected no consistent change in the levels of expression of either IP3R2 or IP3R3 (Fig. 6B). Consistent with these data, inspection of the promoter segments of the IP3R2 and IP3R3 genes also failed to reveal nucleotide sequence corresponding to the deduced PLSCR1-binding site in IP3R1 (GTAACCATGTGGA; see Fig. 5). In addition, an effect of PLSCR1 on constitutive IP3R1 expression was also observed when primary cells and tissue harvested from WT mice versus PLSCR1-/- mice were compared. As shown by Western blots of Fig. 7A, whole cell extracts of brain and bone marrow from PLSCR1-/- mice consistently exhibited lower levels of IP3R1 protein expression than corresponding cells obtained from wild type animals. Similarly, diminished IP3R1 expression was also observed in immortalized kidney epithelial cells obtained from PLSCR(1&3)-/- mice compared with identical cells from wild type animals (Fig. 7B). As was observed for PLSCR1 (1&3)-/- MEF (Fig. 6), the expression of IP3R1 in P"

One challenge is that of identification and assignment of structure/function to the tens of thousands of proteins encoded by prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Another challenge is accurate quantitative analysis of changes in protein levels/activities that occur within a proteome as a response to biological perturbations that are due either to normal developmental and metabolic changes or to abnormalities associated with disease.

Engl. 2004; 43: 5338-5342Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), have been employed. ABPP probes have two general features: 1) an active site-directed (mechanism-based) inactivator or affinity label that reacts with a catalytic residue and forms a covalent adduct with the target enzyme(s) and 2) one or more reporter groups that enable rapid detection (e.g. a fluorophore) and/or affinity isolation (e.g. biotin) (16Speers A.E. Cravatt B.F. ChemBioChem. 2004; 5: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As such, ABPP methods can provide direct information on post-translational forms of protein regulation (17Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, most of the ABPP research has been limited to detection of the target enzymes, usually by Western blotting or in-gel fluorescence. Recently, a gel-free, mass spectrometry-based ABPP (MS-ABPP) method was used in which the labeled active-site peptides of target enzymes were affinity-isolated from the proteolytic digest of the proteome and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) procedures to determine their amino acid sequences and the labeled catalytic residue (6Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the ABPP probe used in that attempt targeted several mechanistically distinct enzyme classes in a non-directed fashion (6Adam G.C. Burbaum J. Kozarich J.W. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 1363-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The MS-ABPP approach relies on the assumption that the active-site peptide, containing the labeled catalytic residue, is highly conserved among members of the same enzyme family and therefore provides sufficient information to decipher the enzyme family to which the target enzyme belongs (18Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). activity-based protein profiling mass spectrometry-based ABPP liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry 2,4-dinitrophenyl 4′-amino-N-{7-[N-(D-biotinoyl)-13-amino-4,7,10-trioxatridecanylamino]}-4,5-dithiaheptanoyl-2,4′-dideoxy-2-fluoro-β-xylobioside glycoside hydrolase carbohydrate-binding module hen egg white lysozyme 2,5-dinitrophenyl β-xylobioside 2,4-dinitrophenylβ-cellobioside 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine electrospray ionization high performance liquid chromatography inverse polymerase chain reaction p-nitrophenyl β-xyloside p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside p-nitrophenyl β-xylobioside p-nitrophenyl β-cellobioside 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-xylobioside. Here, we report the first MS-ABPP analysis of glycosidases in complex mixtures using the strategy shown in Fig. 1A. Biotin as the reporter group enables easy detection as well as affinity isolation using avidin/streptavidin resin (19Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Methods Enzymol.184. 1990: 1-746Google Scholar). The affinity isolation process is facile and fairly efficient because of the presence of a cleavable disulfide bond between the biotin tag and the mechanism-based inactivator (see Fig. 1, A and B). Fig. 1B shows the chemical structure of the ABPP probe 2,4-dinitrophenyl 4′-amino-N-{7-[N-(d-biotinoyl)-13-amino-4,7,10-trioxatridecanylamino]}-4,5-dithiaheptanoyl-2,4′-dideoxy-2-fluoro-β-xylobioside (DNP2FX2SSB) and the mechanism of inactivation of target enzymes. The mechanism-based inactivator moiety of DNP2FX2SSB is a 2-deoxy-2-fluoroxylobioside that targets retaining β-xylanases and mixed-function cellulases (20Ziser L. Setyawati I. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 274: 137-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Birsan C. Johnson P. Joshi M. MacLeod A. McIntosh L. Monem V. Nitz M. Rose D.R. Tull D. Wakarchuck W.W. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. White A. Withers S.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Endo-1,4-β-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) and cellulases (EC 3.2.1.4) are glycoside hydrolases (GHs) that catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of β-1,4-linked polymers or oligomers of d-xylose and d-glucose, respectively. GHs catalyze the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds with either retaining or inverting stereochemical outcome (22Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Retaining glycosidases operate via a double-displacement mechanism that involves formation of a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate (glycosylation) and its breakdown (deglycosylation) (22Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two catalytic carboxylic acid residues (5 Å apart) act as the catalytic nucleophile and the general acid/base, respectively (see Fig. 1B) (22Zechel D.L. Withers S.G. Acc. Chem. Res. 2000; 33: 11-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglycosides with a good aryl leaving group serve as excellent mechanism-based inactivators of retaining glycosidases (23Withers S.G. Street I.P. Bird P. Dolphin D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7530-7531Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Wicki J. Rose D.R. Withers S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 84-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) because, with these molecules, the glycosylation step is usually much faster than the deglycosylation step, thus the fluoroglycosyl-enzyme intermediate accumulates and can be studied (24Wicki J. Rose D.R. Withers S.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 84-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated this MS-ABPP methodology at three levels of increasing complexity. First, as a test of the strategy, we used this approach to isolate and identify the labeled active-site peptides of an endoxylanase (Bcx from Bacillus circulans) and a mixed-function endoxylanase/cellulase (Cex from Cellulomonas fimi) from their peptic digests. As retaining endoxylanases, Bcx (GH family 11) and Cex (GH family 10) were ideal candidates for targeting by our probe and had been investigated extensively (21Birsan C. Johnson P. Joshi M. MacLeod A. McIntosh L. Monem V. Nitz M. Rose D.R. Tull D. Wakarchuck W.W. Wang Q. Warren R.A.J. White A. Withers S.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Second, we applied the method to several model enzyme mixtures (artificial proteomes) including Bcx, Cex, or both as targets. Finally, we applied the method to a complex biological proteome, viz. the secreted proteome of the aerobic mesophilic xylanolytic/cellulolytic soil bacterium C. fimi. C. fimi secretes a complex array of xylanases and cellulases concurrently (25Bray M.R. Creagh A.L. Damude H.G. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Jervis E. Kilburn D.G. MacLeod A.M. Meinke A. Miller Jr., R.C.

Edman peptide sequencing, DNA sequencing, and synthesis of PCR primers were performed by the University of British Columbia Nucleic Acid and Protein Service Unit.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma and were reagent-grade. Synthesis of the ABPP probe DNP2FX2SSB will be reported elsewhere. 5S. J. Williams, O. Hekmat, and S. G. Withers, submitted for publication. Inactivation Kinetics—All kinetic studies were performed using a Unicam 8700 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a circulating water bath. The time-dependent inactivation of each enzyme or proteome by DNP2FX2SSB was monitored by measuring the residual xylanase/cellulase activity over time. This was accomplished by the addition of an aliquot of the inactivation mixture at appropriate time intervals to a solution of the substrate (DNPX2 or DNPC) in the appropriate buffer. The initial rates were then measured under steady-state conditions by spectrophotometric monitoring of the release of the 2,4-dinitrophenol(ate) or 2,5-dinitrophenol(ate) group at a wavelength of either 440 nm (DNPX2) or 400 nm (DNPC). Pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs = ki[I]/(Ki + [I])) for the decay of activity were determined in each case from fitting the decay curve to a single exponential decay equation using nonlinear regression with the program GraFit. For Bcx, the inactivation mixture contained 0.20 mg/ml Bcx and 0.500 mm DNP2FX2SSB in BSA-free buffer A. Both inactivation and control samples were incubated at 40 °C, and aliquots were taken at appropriate time intervals and added to a cuvette containing DNPX2 substrate so that the final assay contained 2.8 μg/ml Bcx (active + inactive) and 2.46 mm DNPX2 in buffer A at 40 °C. For Cex, the inactivation mixture contained 57 μg/ml Cex and 22.9 μm DNP2FX2SSB in BSA-free buffer B. Both inactivation and control samples were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken at appropriate time intervals and added to a cuvette containing DNPC substrate so that the final assay contained 0.81 μg/ml Cex (active + inactive) and 0.493 mm DNPC in buffer B at 37 °C. For the C. fimi secreted proteome, the inactivation mixture contained 5.5 mg/ml protein (from C. fimi culture medium) and 0.100 mm DNP2FX2SSB in BSA-free buffer B. Both inactivation and control samples were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken at appropriate time intervals and added to the cuvette containing either DNPX2 or DNPC substrate so that the final assay contained 0.11 mg/ml protein and 1.00 mm DNPX2 or 2.00 mm DNPC in buffer B at 37 °C. For enzyme inactivation prior to proteolysis for affinity isolation, the desired amount of enzyme or proteome was incubated in the presence of 0.100–0.500 mm DNP2FX2SSB for 2–6 h at the temperatures and conditions mentioned above for each enzyme or proteome. Where necessary, samples were dialyzed at room temperature using a non-cellulose 5-kDa cutoff membrane centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Corp.) to exchange buffer A or B with buffer C and to remove excess inactivator. If no dialysis was necessary, enough buffer C was added to the sample to bring it to pH 2.0. Proteolysis—For Bcx, a solution of inactivated Bcx in buffer C was first heat-denatured (boiling for 2 min) and then proteolyzed in the presence of pepsin (50:1 mass ratio) at room temperature for 3 h. For Cex, a solution of inactivated Cex in buffer C was proteolyzed in the presence of pepsin (100:1 mass ratio) at room temperature for 6 h. For model proteomes A–C, a solution of the inactivated enzyme mixture in buffer C was first heat-denatured (boiling for 2 min) and then proteolyzed in the presence of pepsin (50:1 mass ratio) at room temperature for 6–8 h. For the C. fimi secreted proteome, a sample of the inactivated C. fimi secreted proteome in buffer C was first heat-denatured (boiling for 2 min) and then proteolyzed in the presence of pepsin (50:1 mass ratio) at room temperature for 8–10 h. In all of the above cases, the proteolytic digest was either immediately subjected to the affinity isolation procedure or freeze-dried first. Affinity Isolation of the Labeled Peptides—The peptic digest of the inactivated enzyme or proteome in buffer C was incubated with streptavidin resin at a ratio of 1.0 ml of streptavidin resin/60 nmol of biotin-equivalent at room temperature for 1–2 h with shaking. The unlabeled peptides were washed away in buffer C using a spin filter (Novagen). The labeled peptides bound to the streptavidin resin were incubated with 30 mm TCEP in buffer D for 40 min at room temperature with shaking and eluted using a spin filter. The reduction process was repeated several times. The eluted peptide samples were then freeze-dried, redissolved in H2O, and analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) MS. LC/ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS Analyses—ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a PE-Sciex API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario) equipped with an ion spray ion source. The ion source voltage was 5 kV, and the orifice voltage was 50 V. All spectra were obtained in the positive-ion single quadrupole scan mode (LC/MS) or the tandem MS fragment ion scan mode (MS/MS). In the LC/MS mode, the quadrupole mass analyzer was scanned over an m/z range of 300–2000 atomic mass units with a step size of 0.5 Da and a dwell time of 1.0 ms/step. In the MS/MS mode, the spectra were obtained by selectively introducing the precursor peptide with the m/z value of interest from the first quadrupole (Q1) into the collision cell (Q2) and observing the fragment ions in the third quadrupole (Q3). Q3 scan range was 50–1900 atomic mass units with the same step size and dwell time as above. Protein or peptide samples were introduced by reverse-phase HPLC on an Ultrafast microprotein analyzer (Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Auburn, CA) directly interfaced with the mass spectrometer. For protein analysis, the sample was loaded onto a PLRP-S C4 column (1.0 × 50 mm; Michrom Bioresources Inc.) and eluted with a linear gradient of 5–90% solvent B over 3 min, followed by 90% solvent B over 5 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min (solvent A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and 2% CH3CN in water; and solvent B, 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% CH3CN in water). For peptide analysis, the sample was loaded onto a Jupiter C18 column (1.0 × 150 mm; Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B over 60 min at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. C. fimi Culture Growth and Secreted Protein Preparation—C. fimi cells (ATCC 484) were grown in minimal medium containing 0.1% xylan (from birchwood) as the inducer at 30 °C for 5 days. Cells were then removed by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the culture supernatant was concentrated and exchanged with buffer E at 4 °C under N2 pressure in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell (Millipore, Beverly, MA) using a non-cellulose ultrafiltration membrane disc (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). The secreted protein preparation in buffer E was then filtered through a 0.45-μm non-cellulose membrane (Millipore Corp.) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit with BSA standards (Pierce). A measure of the xylanase and cellulase activities of the secreted protein preparation was obtained by assaying with DNPX2 and DNPC as the substrates. PCR Amplification of the Internal Gene Probe—The internal gene probe encoding the part of the new C. fimi glycanase (named Cfx) lying between the acid/base and nucleophile regions was PCR-amplified using 100 ng of NotI-digested C. fimi genomic DNA, 1 μm each primer (Cfx-AB, 5′-TRS GAC GTS RTC AAC GAG-3′; and Cfx-Nu, 5′-GTC SAG CTC SGT GAT CTG SAC-3′), 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm each dNTP, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, 4 mm MgSO4, and 2.5 units of Pwo polymerase in a 50-μl reaction volume. Thirty PCR cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C) were performed in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 2400, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Both ends of the resulting PCR product were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and then the DNA fragment was subcloned into SmaI-digested pUC18. Inverse PCR—We used the inverse PCR method (iPCR) as described by Ochman et al. (36Ochman H. Gerber A.S. Hartl D.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 621-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to clone the entire sequence of the cfx gene. Genomic DNA was digested with BamHI, NotI, SacI, or XhoI, and then the self-ligated libraries were used as templates for iPCR. A total of three DNA fragments (Cfx-Sc, Cfx-Xh, and Cfx-Bm) were amplified using three primer sets as follows: a set of the iPCR-rev primer (5′-CCA GTC GTT GCC GGT GCG CTG CAG GTT GGA GTC-3′) and the iPCR-fw primer (5′-TGC GTC GGC TTC CAG GCG CAC TTC AAC TCC GGC-3′), a set of the iPCR-Sac-rev primer (5′-CCG AGC GGT CGC CGT CAG CCA TCT GCG AGT-3′) and the iPCR-rev primer, and a set of the iPCR-Bam-rev primer (5′-TCA GGG CGT GGT CAG GTC GAA GCT GCG GAC-3′) and the iPCR-Xho-fw primer (5′-GAC CGT CCG GTC GCC GCA GAA GAT CAT CGC-3′), respectively. After analysis of the sequences of the three fragments, primers for amplification of the full-length cfx gene were designed as follows: Cfx-TOP-Nc primer, 5′-GCG AGT GAC CAT GGC CAC GAA ACT CCA CGC GAC-3′; and Cfx-END-Nt primer, 5′-GTC ACG TGC GCG GCC GCA TGA CCC GCT GAC-3′. The products of PCR with these primers were subcloned into plasmid pR2TK, which has a B. subtilis α-amylase promoter (amyR2) from pAR2 (37Weickert M.J. Chambliss G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3656-3666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as multiple cloning sites, a six-histidine tag sequence, and the T7 terminator from pET28a. The resulting plasmid was designated pR2Cfx-His6. Expression of the cfx Gene in Escherichia coli—A single colony was cultured overnight in 50 ml of LB medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. The pre-culture was then re-inoculated in 1 liter of medium and grown for an additional 15 h. The cell pellet was harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French press at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the soluble extract was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The protein was then dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA™ protein assay reagent kit with BSA standards. Cfx Kinetics—Initial rates of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl β-xyloside (pNPX), p-nitrophenyl β-glucoside (pNPG), p-nitrophenyl β-xylobioside (pNPX2), and p-nitrophenyl β-cellobioside (pNPC) catalyzed by Cfx (the new xylanase from C. fimi) were determined at 37 °C by monitoring the reactions spectrophotometrically at 400 nm, where Δϵ400 = 7280 m–1 cm–1 (32Kempton J.B. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9961-9969Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in buffer F at 37 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. The substrate and enzyme concentrations in the assays were as follows: 1.0–10 mm pNPX and 1.1 μm Cfx; 1.0–10 mm pNPG and 6.8 μm Cfx; 0.02–2.0 mm pNPX2 and 0.14 μm Cfx; and 0.2–10 mm pNPC and 2.8 μm Cfx. For pNPX2 and pNPC, the plots of initial rates versus substrate concentrations were hyperbolic, and the values of Km and Vmax were determined by fitting t"

Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The A-proteins, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), competitively bind to the heptameric PA63, forming the (PA63)7-LF/EF complex which is endocytosed (7Mourez M. Lacy D.B. Cunningham K. Legmann R. Sellman B.R. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 287-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon acidification of the endosome, the heptameric PA63 is thought to undergo a conformational change, insert into the membrane, and form a functional transmembrane pore. In this model, LF and EF are subsequently translocated across the endosomal membrane into the cytosol (8Milne J.C. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Determining the mechanism of PA63-mediated translocation of EF/LF into the cytosol remains an interesting challenge. Here we present proof-of principle for a potential biosensor in anthrax diagnostics and therapeutics. Proteins—Purified PA63, LF, and EF proteins (List Biological Laboratories Inc.) from Bacillus anthracis were used for these studies. Antibody—Hybridoma PA63 1G3-1-1 was prepared by fusing spleen cells from female BALB/c mice injected with PA63 with SP2/O-Ag 14 myeloma cells and subcloning positive hybridomas twice by limiting dilution (9Little S.F. Novak J.M. Lowe J.R. Leppla S.H. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Lidgerding B.C. Friedlander A.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Little S.F. Leppla S.H. Cora E. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ascites was produced in BALB/c female mice and was clarified by centrifugation. This ascites monoclonal antibody, 1G3-1-1, prevents binding of LF to PA63 through steric hindrance (9Little S.F. Novak J.M. Lowe J.R. Leppla S.H. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Lidgerding B.C. Friedlander A.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Channel recordings were carried out with planar lipid bilayer membranes as previously described (11Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Briefly, solvent-free diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine membranes were formed on a 50-100-μm diameter hole in a thin Teflon partition. The partition separated two identical Teflon chambers that each contained ∼2 ml of aqueous solution (0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MES, pH 6.6). Voltage was applied across the membrane via Ag-AgCl electrodes. The current was amplified using a patch-clamp instrument (Axon Instruments 200B), recorded with an analog to digital converter (Axon Instruments Digi-Data 1322), and analyzed off-line. A negative transmembrane potential drove anions from the cis to the trans chamber. Details of this particular method were summarized elsewhere (12Kasianowicz J.J. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 94-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Channels were formed by adding small aliquots (∼100 ng) of the purified PA63 to the aqueous electrolyte solution bathing one side of the membrane (herein called cis). The formation of individual channels was indicated by the stepwise increases in ionic current monitored at +50 mV applied potential. During recording of the ionic current in the steady-state experiments, the membrane potential was held constant at either +50 or +100 mV. To determine the instantaneous current-voltage (I-V) relationships, we generated current by applying brief (0.5 s) voltage pulses (typically +200 to -200 mV in 10-mV steps) across the membrane and averaged the first 100 ms of the signal to obtain the instantaneous (I-V) relationship. Collection of Plasma from Infected Animals and Purification of the (PA63)7-LF Complex—The (PA63)7-LF complex was purified from the plasma of infected guinea pigs. Research was conducted in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and other statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 1996) in facilities that are fully accredited by the Assesssment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International. Infected animals that appeared moribund were anesthetized, and blood was drawn into tubes containing EDTA to inhibit cleavage of PA83 by serum proteases. Blood samples were mixed, centrifuged, and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and stored at -70 °C. Approximately 0.25 ml of the sample (diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline) was loaded on a Superose 6 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. LF activity in the different fractions collected was determined by fluorescent plate-based assay as previously described (13Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and briefly summarized below. The peak fraction corresponding to the (PA63)7-LF complex and exhibiting LF activity was used for electrophysiological studies. Fluorescent-based Kinetic Assay—Known concentrations of serially diluted free LF or unknown concentrations of complexed LF were incubated with 20 μm optimized peptide substrate (13Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements were made every minute for 30 min using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Safire). The peptide has an excitation peak at 324 nm and an emission peak at 395 nm. A calibration curve was established using free LF as a standard. The complexed LF concentration was determined using the standards. The concentration of complexed LF was also confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (14Panchal R.G. Halverson K.M. Ribot W. Lane D. Kenny T. Abshire T.G. Ezzell J.W. Hoover T.A. Powell B. Little S. Kasianowicz J.J. Bavari S. J. Biol.

Fig. 1A shows an ionic current recording for 14 PA63 channels (∼3.8 pA/channel for an applied potential V =+50 mV) in a planar phospholipid bilayer membrane. The introduction of LF (∼3 nm) causes a rapid and virtually complete reduction in PA63 channel current as revealed by the stepwise decrements (Fig. 1A). Previous reports at pH 6.6 and 5.5 suggested that various factors, such as tetraalkylammonium ions and the N-terminal binding fragments of both EF and LF (i.e. EFN and LFN), can cause a decrease in the PA63 channel conductance (15Blaustein R.O.

In these earlier studies, the ionic current blockades were removed by greater transmembrane voltages (16Blaustein R.O. Lea E.J. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 921-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Blaustein R.O. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Finkelstein A.

J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For instance, voltages greater than +40 mV increased PA63 channel conductance at pH 5.5 following the blockade by LFN (19Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, although no data were shown, the authors state that current blockade relief is not seen at pH 6.6 for LFN. Interestingly, this is exactly the case for the full-length LF-induced blockade that we report here at pH 6.6 (see Figs. 1 and 2 and below).FIGURE 2The apparent dissociation constant for EF and LF binding to PA63 ion channels estimated from instantaneous I-V relationships. The ionic current versus time for PA63 channels in the absence (A) and presence (B) of EF (∼2.5 nm). The current is caused by short voltage pulses (∼500-ms duration) that varied from +120 to -120 mV in 10-mV increments (short-lived capacitance current artifacts are not shown). EF blocks PA63 channels much more effectively for positive applied potentials. C, the instantaneous I-V relationship of PA63 channels alone (filled squares) and in the presence of ∼3 nm EF (open squares). The current is generated by short voltage pulses that varied from +130 to -130 mV.

LF = 0, filled squares; 11 pm, open squares; 32 pm, open circles; 53 pm, open triangles; 85 pm, open hexagons; and 160 pm, open diamonds. The current is caused by short voltage pulses (∼500-ms duration) that varied from +130 to -130 mV in 10-mV increments. E, the ratio of the ionic current in the presence of LF to that in its absence as a function of LF concentration for three different values of the applied potential (+50 mV, filled stars; +100 mV, crosses; and +130 mV, asterisks). The solid line through the data is the result of a least-squares fit of an equation to the data that assumes 1 LF binds to 1 PA63 channel (see “Results and Discussion”). The result suggests that the apparent dissociation constant for the binding of LF to PA63 is ∼50 pm. The buffer in both the cis and trans chambers for each panel was 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MES at pH 6.6.

Lea E.J. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 921-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Blaustein R.O. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The greater the magnitude of the applied potential, the more rapidly the channels gate to lesser conductance states. In addition, the current decays more rapidly for negative potentials than for positive voltages of the same magnitude (Fig. 1B). In the presence of LF (Fig. 1C), the blockade of PA63 channel conductance is highly asymmetric with respect to the sign of the transmembrane potential. That is, the ionic current is virtually nonextant for positive potentials, whereas negative voltages (i.e. -50 and -100 mV) produce significant current through the PA63 channels even in the presence of LF. In contrast, LF added to the trans chamber had no effect on the PA63 conductance for either sign of the potential (data not shown). In addition, LF had no effect on channels formed by the pore-forming toxin Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (data not shown). These experiments demonstrate that the creation of a rectifying ion channel by LF binding to the cap domain of PA63 is not only site specific but also pore-forming toxin specific. Similar results were observed for EF binding to the channel formed by PA63. The intrinsic gating of the PA63 channel (Fig. 1B) makes accurate determination of LF-(PA63)7 or EF-(PA63)7 binding parameters difficult. However, measuring the PA63 instantaneous I-V relationship, without and with either LF or EF, avoids that issue. In particular, several hundred ms-long voltage pulses (e.g. +120 to -120 mV, in 10-mV steps) are applied across the membrane in the absence or presence of ∼2.5 nm EF (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). EF binding to the PA63 channel changes the I-V relationship from slightly nonlinear to strongly rectifying, as was observed for full-length LF (13Panchal R.G. Hermone A.R. Nguyen T.L. Wong T.Y. Schwarzenbacher R. Schmidt J. Lane D. McGrath C. Turk B.E. Burnett J. Aman M.J. Little S. Sausville E.A. Zaharevitz D.W. Cantley L.C. Liddington R.C. Gussio R. Bavari S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Note that EF causes virtually complete extinction of the ionic current only for positive voltages. The I-V relationship for a similar experiment is shown in Fig. 2C. These functional measurements and the analysis below demonstrate that the interaction between (PA63)7 and EF or LF cannot be described as merely a passive block of the PA63 ion channel. In fact, the LF-induced blockade of PA63-mediated tracer ion flux into and out of Chinese hamster ovary-CK1 cells as demonstrated by Zhao et al. (20Zhao J. Milne J.C. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18626-18630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) supports our conclusion that LF and EF bind strongly to PA63 channels and notably decrease PA63 ionic conductance for even small positive potentials (Fig. 2B and Ref. 14Panchal R.G. Halverson K.M. Ribot W. Lane D. Kenny T. Abshire T.G. Ezzell J.W. Hoover T.A. Powell B. Little S. Kasianowicz J.J. Bavari S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10834-10839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our electrophysiological results (Figs. 1 and 2) demonstrate that both full-length LF and EF markedly occlude PA63 ion conductance only at positive applied potentials. The block may persist for zero transmembrane potential. The effect shown in Fig. 2B provides a method to probe the interaction between EF or LF and the PA63 channel. Fig. 2D illustrates the I-V relationships for PA63 channels in the absence of LF and for five different concentrations of LF. For increasing [LF] and V >0, the instantaneous current decreases markedly with respect to that for [LF] = 0. In contrast, for V <0, LF has only a slight effect on the instantaneous current. The ratio of the current in the presence of LF to that in the absence of LF for 0 ≤[LF] ≤2.5 nm for three different positive applied potentials is shown in Fig. 2E. In each case, an increase in LF concentration monotonically decreases the PA63 current for V >0. To estimate the apparent binding constant of LF to the PA63 pore, we assume that one LF molecule binds reversibly to the channel (21Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Goel S. Swain P.K. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1853-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can thereby block it. A least squares best fit of this simple model to the data in Fig. 2E suggests that the apparent dissociation constant is KD ∼ 50 pm. Despite the good fit of the model to the data, LF may bind even more strongly to PA63. For example, the actual concentration of LF might be lower if LF binds to trace amounts of PA63 (∼10 pm) in solution. The apparent binding constant deduced from the effect of LF on the PA63 channel I-V relationship (Fig. 2E) is consistent with estimates from cell-based and Biacore surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays (∼10 pm to 2.5 nm) (22Leppla S.H. Alouf J. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, New York1991: 277-302Google Scholar, 23Quinn C.P. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20124-20130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, unlike SPR, the electrophysiology method described here provides a functional test of PA63 and LF and is obtained in minutes rather than days as is required by cell-based methods. Although we do not yet understand the physical mechanism for EF- and LF-induced rectification of the PA63 channel, the schematic in Fig. 2F illustrates several hypothetical models for the effect. There are at least two possible mechanisms that can account for the LF-induced current decrease for V >0 (Figs. 1 and 2). LF could be forced into the pore entrance, perhaps by the small electric field gradient near the pore mouth, and thereby occlude the channel (Fig. 2F, top panel). Alternatively, LF might be driven completely through the channel (not illustrated). EF or LF channel blockade reversal by negative potentials may be the result of their removal from the PA63 ion conduction pathway like a swinging gate or the complete separation from the PA63 channel (Fig. 2F, bottom panel). The (PA63)7-LF interaction (Fig. 2) might prove useful for understanding the mechanism by which PA, LF, and EF traverse the endosomal membrane through further characterization of the protein-protein interactions. Another promising prospect includes identifying and screening compounds and/or antibodies that disrupt toxin function or interaction. To test this hypothesis, we use a previously characterized monoclonal antibody, 1G3-1-1, that prevents binding of LF to PA63 through steric hindrance (9Little S.F. Novak J.M. Lowe J.R. Leppla S.H. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Lidgerding B.C. Friedlander A.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, previous studies showed that 1G3-1-1 neutralized LF toxin both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, this monoclonal antibody protected 100% of animals injected with lethal toxin (i.e. LF bound to the PA63 heptamer). In vitro, the monoclonal antibody prevented LF from binding to the protective antigen and neutralized the cytolytic activity even if lethal toxin was formed prior to monoclonal antibody addition (9Little S.F. Novak J.M. Lowe J.R. Leppla S.H. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Lidgerding B.C. Friedlander A.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although it is known that this antibody inhibits the binding of LF to PA, to date there have been no reported studies showing the effect of antibodies on the channel conductance. In our electrophysiological studies, the antibody had virtually no effect on the I-V relationship of PA63 channels but completely inhibited LF-induced blockade (Fig. 3A). As a control, incubating the channels with bovine serum albumin (150 nm) had no effect on LF-induced PA63 channel blockade (data not shown). Thus, the effect of the antibody is specific. We conclude that the results in Fig. 3A provide the basis for a quantitative biosensor to rapidly screen for one type of anthrax therapeutics. Agents that bind to the PA63 channel (and do not cause current blockades) or to LF would inhibit LF-induced rectification of the instantaneous I-V relationship for PA63 channels. Other potentially useful anthrax therapeutics could conceivably bind to and occlude the PA63 pore. In a recent study, we showed the presence of a functionally active complex in the serum of infected animals (14Panchal R.G. Halverson K.M. Ribot W. Lane D. Kenny T. Abshire T.G. Ezzell J.W. Hoover T.A. Powell B. Little S. Kasianowicz J.J. Bavari S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10834-10839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the applicability of this method for diagnostic purposes, we first characterized the channel properties of anthrax lethal toxin complex purified from the serum of an infected guinea pig. Serum samples contain a large number of contaminating cellular and bacterial proteins that may possibly interfere with the channel recordings. Hence, size exclusion chromatography was used to remove most of the small contaminating proteins, although the fraction corresponding to the high molecular weight complex may also contain some contaminating proteins. The purified in vivo (PA63)7-LF complex, at an initial LF concentration of ∼30 pm in the bilayer chamber, formed strongly rectifying channels (Fig. 3, B and C), as do PA63 channels after the addition of LF (e.g. Fig. 2D) and the complex formed in vitro (14Panchal R.G. Halverson K.M. Ribot W. Lane D. Kenny T. Abshire T.G. Ezzell J.W. Hoover T.A. Powell B. Little S. Kasianowicz J.J. Bavari S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10834-10839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrate the physiological relevance of the rectifying channel in vivo. In addition, they support earlier results that suggested that PA63 was complexed with lethal factor in the blood of infected animals (25Ezzell Jr., J.W. Abshire T.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The concentration and activity of LF in the in vivo formed complex was determined using a fluorescent-based kinetic assay (Fig. 3D) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Having identified and characterized the conducting properties of the purified infected complex, we may eventually be able to isolate the signal of the complex from the noise generated by contaminating serum proteins. Studies are ongoing to detect the complex in serum samples at various stages of infection. Figs. 1, 2, 3 demonstrate that LF and EF bind to and block the PA63 channel at positive applied potentials. This observation raises the question: why is the PA63 channel blocked only at positive potentials? Recent experiments (26Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and molecular modeling (27Nguyen T.L. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2004; 22: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) indicate that the (PA63)7 channel bears a striking similarity to the crystal structure of the S. aureus α-hemolysin channel (28Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). According to the model for the PA63 channel, it has a mushroom-shaped cap domain and a long stem (Fig. 4, A and B) that consists of 14 strands that comprise an anti-parallel β-barrel. The model illustrates how three LF molecules might bind to the PA63 channel. Because the LF- and EF-induced blockades are sensitive to electric field polarity, it is reasonable to speculate that an electrostatic or electrokinetic mechanism is involved. The LF binding site on the PA63 channel is mostly basic (Fig. 4C); it is possible that when the transmembrane potential polarity is reversed, the net positive or negative surface charges of the LF molecule (Fig. 4D) cause small mechanical shifts in its position, resulting in PA63 channel blockade. Based on this hypothetical model, the blockade of the channel by LF for positive applied potentials could be caused by either a physical occlusion (by LF) or a change in the PA63 channel structure induced by the binding of LF. The view shown in Fig. 4B suggests that even a small shift in the location of a single LF molecule could block the pore entrance. It is conceivable that a positive (or negative) potential would drive LF into (or out of) the ionic conduction pathway as discussed above. Because the LF-induced block of the PA63 channel can be triggered by very small positive potentials or removed by very small negative potentials, the portion of LF that occludes the pore may lie close to or be attached to the pore mouth at all times. For example, we found that when a steady membrane potential is reversed from negative to positive polarity (50 mV) in the presence of LF at ∼2 × 1012 molecules/cm3 (Fig. 1), the occlusion occurs in less than 50 ms with no subsequent increase in current (data not shown). Simple but conservative model calculations indicate that this rapid occlusion cannot be explained by the LF flux arriving at the channel entrances via diffusion from the bulk (<2 LF molecules/s) or by LF molecules being driven there by the small electric field (∼5 × 10-9 V/cm) in the bulk electrolyte solution. The slightly reduced ionic current for negative membrane potentials observed in the presence of LF (Fig. 1) would also be consistent with LF strongly bound near the channel openings but only partially blocking the ionic current. Additional experimental results and analysis are needed to determine the mechanism by which the applied potential modulates the LF-induced PA63 current blockages. Electrophysiology measurements of PA63 channel blockade by EFN (18Finkelstein A. Toxicology. 1994; 87: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and LFN (19Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and cell-based studies that demonstrate the LF- and LFN-induced blockade of PA63-doped cells (20Zhao J. Milne J.C. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18626-18630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have led to the hypothesis that at pH 5.5 LF and EF are translocated through PA63 channels that have a diameter of ∼1.1 nm (16Blaustein R.O. Lea E.J. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 921-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Blaustein R.O. Finkelstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 96: 905-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our results using the physiologically relevant full-length LF at pH 6.6 show that the LF-induced PA63 current blockades are persistent (Fig. 1). The blockades remain even after extensive perfusion and the passage of more than 20 min (data not shown). The blockade is neither short-lived nor removed by an increase in transmembrane potential (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, there are no observed short-lived transient blockades caused by LF at pH 6.6. It has been shown that the passage of individual polynucleotides through the α-hemolysin channel causes transient current blockades (29Kasianowicz J.J. Brandin E. Branton D. Deamer D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13770-13773Crossref PubMed Scopus (2689) Google Scholar, 30Kasianowicz J.J. Henrickson S.E. Weetall H.H. Robertson B. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2268-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and that proteins can occlude other channels (31Simon S.M. Blobel G. Cell. 1991; 65: 371-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Thus, most likely, the full-length LF does not thread through the channel at pH 6.6. Our data support the model depicted in Fig. 2F that shows LF bound to PA63 for long times and that it acts as a gate that is open for negative voltages and closed for positive voltages. Our preliminary experiments at pH 5.5 suggest that full-length LF does not bind as strongly to the PA63 channel as it does at pH 6.6. However, none of those data suggest that the full-length LF translocates through the PA63 pore. Several key differences in our approach as compared with that in a recent report (19Zhang S. Udho E. Wu Z. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) are the pH (6.6), which affects the value of fixed charges on the protein surfaces, the larger size of the physiologically relevant full-length LF and EF (e.g. 89 kDa versus 30 kDa for EFN), and the use of instantaneous I-V data. In this report, electrophysiological measurements and analysis of the functional interaction between anthrax toxins in planar bilayer membranes demonstrate that LF and EF bind to the PA63 channel and convert it to a strongly rectifying pore at pH 6.6. At ∼10 pm concentration, LF occludes PA63 channels in planar lipid bilayer membranes for V >0. The marked voltage-dependent, diode-like effect suggests that PA may control the direction of ion flow across cell membranes. The toxins may also influence the transmembrane potential, as is true for other rectifying channels (for review see Ref. 32Lu Z. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 103-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). By controlling the endosomal pH and H+influx, PA could create an ideal environment for toxin translocation and/or lysis of the endosome. Exploitation of this effect as an innovative means of characterizing anthrax toxin interactions is only one demonstration of the value of this technique. In comparison to other methods, such as monoclonal antibody assays measuring competition between radiolabeled LF and unlabeled LF or EF to PA (22Leppla S.H. Alouf J. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, New York1991: 277-302Google Scholar), cell-based cytotoxicity assays (23Quinn C.P. Singh Y. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20124-20130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and surface plasmon resonance measurements (24Elliott J.L. Mogridge J. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the approach reported here is a rapid quantitative tool to determine the effective concentrations/binding constants or disruption between LF or EF with PA63. This report demonstrates three exciting applications of this method as a biosensor for anthrax diagnostics. First, full-length LF or EF can be rapidly quantitated at low concentrations. Second, therapeutic agents against anthrax can be rapidly screened. Third, purified lethal toxin from infected animal blood can be detected at low concentrations (∼30 pm). The application of the methods described herein will enhance efforts to render anthrax toxin ineffective. We thank Dr. John Ezzell and Wilson Ribot (U. S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases) for the kind gift of the purified (PA63)7-LF complex from infected animals."

A synthetic active site catalyzes tRNA aminoacylation, while an editing active site hydrolyzes mischarged tRNAs. Prolyl-tRNA synthetases (ProRS) have been shown to misacylate Cys onto tRNAPro, but lack a Cys-specific editing function. The synthetase-like Haemophilus influenzae YbaK protein was recently shown to hydrolyze misacylated Cys-tRNAPro in trans. However, the mechanism of specific substrate selection by this single domain hydrolase is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that YbaK alone appears to lack specific tRNA recognition capabilities. Moreover, YbaK cannot compete for aminoacyl-tRNAs in the presence of elongation factor Tu, suggesting that YbaK acts before release of the aminoacyl-tRNA from the synthetase. In support of this idea, cross-linking studies reveal the formation of binary (ProRS·YbaK) and ternary (ProRS·YbaK·tRNA) complexes. The binding constants for the interaction between ProRS and YbaK are 550 nm and 45 nm in the absence and presence of tRNAPro, respectively.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases maintain the high fidelity of protein synthesis by activating specific amino acids and transferring them to cognate tRNAs in a process known as aminoacylation. However, some synthetases are known to misactivate noncognate amino acids, transferring them onto their cognate tRNAs. Therefore, to ensure accurate translation of the genetic code, these enzymes, which include members of both classes of synthetases, have evolved proofreading or editing functions (1Baldwin A.N.

Pretransfer editing involves hydrolysis of the misactivated aminoacyl-adenylate, whereas post-transfer editing refers to specific hydrolysis of misacylated tRNA. To clear noncognate amino acids, a double-sieve mechanism was proposed, wherein larger amino acids are rejected by the aminoacylation active site (i.e. coarse sieve) while smaller amino acids are cleared in a second editing active site (i.e. fine sieve) (18Fersht A.R.

Recently, we showed that the Haemophilus influenzae YbaK protein, which shares significant sequence and structural homology to the Ala-specific editing domain of bacterial ProRSs, possesses post-transfer editing activity in vitro (16Wong F.C.

Interestingly, this free-standing editing domain has an altered substrate specificity relative to ProRS. Whereas the full-length synthetase edits Ala-tRNAPro, the YbaK protein hydrolyzes Cys-tRNAPro. These data support at least one mechanism by which cells can survive despite the capability of ProRSs to misacylate Cys onto tRNAPro (14Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H.

These results led to the proposal that a triple sieve mechanism of editing may be used to clear Cys-tRNAPro in at least some organisms, with the YbaK protein functioning as a third sieve in trans (28An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that mischarged Cys-tRNAPro species indeed form in Escherichia coli cells, and that the YbaK protein possesses Cys hydrolysis activity in vivo (29Ruan B. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25887-25891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, many open questions remain regarding the mechanism of this novel trans-editing function. For example, whether YbaK acts alone or in complex with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is unknown. Here, we continue to probe the substrate and co-factor requirements for specific deacylation by H. influenzae YbaK. We demonstrate that, in the absence of other factors, all Cys-tRNA species tested are edited by YbaK, including Cys-tRNACys. However, in vitro kinetic data suggest that the rate of Cys-tRNACys hydrolysis by YbaK is significantly lower than the rate of Cys-tRNACys synthesis by cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CysRS). In contrast, YbaK hydrolyzes Cys-tRNAPro at a rate that exceeds Cys-tRNAPro synthesis by ProRS. Moreover, fluorescence anisotropy measurements and chemical cross-linking studies support the formation of a novel ProRS·YbaK·tRNAPro trans-editing complex. Therefore, editing of Cys-tRNAPro is likely to be achieved in vivo via specific interactions between YbaK and ProRS·tRNAPro. This is the first demonstration that a free-standing editing protein forms a complex with a synthetase-tRNA pair, and provides a model for understanding how specific substrate selection is achieved by a single domain editing module.

The mischarged tRNAs were purified by repeated phenol extractions followed by ethanol precipitation. The aminoacyl-tRNAs were quantified by scintillation counting and stored at –20 °C in 50 mm KPO4 (pH 5.0). Deacylation Assays—Deacylation assays were carried out at room temperature according to published conditions (11Beuning P.J. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reactions contained ∼1.0 μm E. coli [35S]Cys-tRNACys, 0.1 μm E. coli [35S]Cys-tRNAPro, 0.1 μm E. coli [35S]Cys-G1 tRNAPro or 0.3 μm M. jannaschii [35S]Cys-tRNAPro. Reactions were initiated with the amount of protein indicated in the figure legends. In each case, a background reaction was carried out in which buffer (0.15 m KPO4, pH 7.0) was used to initiate the reaction. Although for clarity only one representative data set is shown in the figures, a separate background reaction was performed for each aminoacyl-tRNA species. First order deacylation rate constants (kobs) were calculated according to kobs = ln(2)/t1/2 (43Jakubowski H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The experimentally determined half-lives, t1/2, represent the average of at least three independent trials. Fluorophore Labeling of H. influenzae YbaK Protein—A solution of Alexa Fluor· (AF) 488-tetrafluorophenyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was prepared in distilled Me2SO, and the concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient supplied by the manufacturer (ϵ494 = 71,000 cm–1 m–1). The YbaK protein stock was desalted by elution through a MicroSpin™ Sephadex G25 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl. The protein (40 μm) was incubated with 10-fold molar excess of AF for 15 min at room temperature in the same buffer. Unreacted dye was immediately removed by elution through a MicroSpin™ Sephadex G25 column. The labeled protein, YbaK-AF, was applied to a Microcon YM-10 concentrator (Amicon) to remove residual free dye and to exchange into the following buffer: 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40% glycerol. The labeled protein was visualized on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and its final concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). The labeling stoichiometry was determined by Equation 1, R=[A494×(dilution factor)]/[ϵ494×Y](Eq.1) where R is the molar ratio of dye to YbaK, A494 represents the absorbance of the labeled protein solution at 494 nm, ϵ494 is the extinction coefficient of the dye, and Y is the final concentration of YbaK-AF determined by the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Prior to use in fluorescence anisotropy measurements, the activity of YbaK-AF was verified by standard deacylation assays using Cys-tRNAPro as a substrate (28An S. Musier-Forsyth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42359-42362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy of YbaK-AF as a function of increasing concentrations of an unlabeled protein or protein·tRNA complex. YbaK-AF (50 nm) was incubated with varying amounts of the desired unlabeled protein (or protein·tRNA complex) for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl. The following concentration ranges were used: E. coli ProRS (40 nm to 8 μm), CysRS (15 nm to 10 μm), AlaRS (25 nm to 6 μm), ProRS·tRNAPro (40 nm to 3 μm), CysRS·tRNACys (10 nm to 2.2 μm), AlaRS·tRNAAla (25 nm to 6 μm), and BSA (40 nm to 8 μm). The synthetase·tRNA complexes were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to incubation with YbaK-AF. Anisotropy measurements were made on a PTI spectrofluorometer (Model QM-2000; Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 490 nm and 520 nm, respectively (slit widths = 5 nm). Anisotropy was measured using the time-based function for 30 s (integration time = 1 s; resolution = 8 s), and the data were averaged. All measurements were carried out at least three times. The titration curves were fit to Equation 2, which assumes a 1:1 binding stoichiometry (44Muller B. Restle T. Reinstein J. Goody R.S.

Cross-linking Analysis—Cross-linking reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). E. coli ProRS (2.5 μm), H. influenzae YbaK (20 μm), and E. coli tRNAPro (20 μm) were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature followed by addition of Ru(bpy)3Cl2 (125 μm) (Fluka) and ammonium persulfate (2.5 mm) in the dark. Samples were irradiated with a flashlight for 1 min at a 7-cm distance. Reactions were quenched with protein loading buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. After heating for 5 min at 80 °C, samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized using Coomassie Blue stain. Some experiments were carried out using 32P-labeled tRNAPro prepared by in vitro transcription using α-[32P]GTP and visualized using phosphorimaging. In addition to reactions containing all three molecules (i.e. ProRS, YbaK, and tRNA), two-component (i.e. ProRS and YbaK, ProRS and tRNA, and YbaK and tRNA) and single component cross-linking reactions were also carried out. In some experiments, E. coli CysRS or BSA were substituted for ProRS. Negative control experiments were performed in the absence of one of the three components required for the cross-linking reaction (i.e. visible light, Ru(bpy)3Cl2, or ammonium persulfate). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—The ProRS·YbaK·tRNAPro cross-linking reaction was performed as described above, except that the quenching step was performed with only 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The sample was then subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis. Briefly, the sample was applied onto an Immobiline DryStrip gel (13 cm or 24 cm, Amersham Biosciences) to separate proteins based on their isoelectric points (between pH 3 to 10) using the Ettan IPGphor Isoelectric Focusing System (Amersham Biosciences). The strip was then loaded onto a precast 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) for separation in the second dimension. Bands were visualized using the Deep Purple™ Total Protein Stain (Amersham Biosciences). This work was performed at the Mass Spectrometry Consortium for the Life Sciences and Protein Analysis Facility at University of Minnesota. In-gel Tryptic Digestion and Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Following cross-linking, the desired bands from the polyacrylamide gel (one- or two-dimensional) were cut out and soaked in buffer (80 μl) containing 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5), 5 mm CaCl2, and 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega). After incubation on ice for 1 h, excess liquid was removed and 80 μl of buffer containing 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) and 5 mm CaCl2 was added. The reaction tube was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. After removing excess liquid, incubation in 100 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.5 was carried out for 20 min at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the gel piece using a freshly prepared 5% formic acid solution in 50% CH3CN. For mass spectrometry analysis, the sample was desalted using a Pep-Clean C18 spin column (Pierce). The desalted sample was lyophilized and submitted for electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis carried out at the Mass Spectrometry Consortium for the Life Sciences and Protein Analysis Facility (University of Minnesota). Obtained product ion mass spectra were searched using the following software package/data base: ProID (ABI)/NCBI non-redundant data base. Mass accuracy was calculated by Equation 3.

Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the kinetic and selectivity profile of OCT3 and the comparatively low levels of mRNA and protein expression of this homolog in the kidney suggest that renal secretion is dominated by some combination of OCT1 and OCT2 activity. Perhaps the most convincing evidence of the significance of OCT1 and OCT2 in renal OC secretion is the observation that secretion of the prototypic OC, tetraethylammonium (TEA), is completely eliminated in OCT1/2-/- mice (8Jonker J.W. Wagenaar E. Van Eijl S. Schinkel A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7902-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In human kidney, OCT2 appears to be the predominant OC transporter. Expression of mRNA for OCT2 far exceeds that for OCT1, and immunocytochemistry clearly shows a basolateral expression for OCT2 and little or no presence of OCT1 (9Motohashi H. Sakurai Y. Saito H. Masuda S. Urakami Y. Goto M. Fukatsu A. Ogawa O. Inui K.-I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 866-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are, however, clear species differences in this profile, with substantial expression of both OCT1 and OCT2 evident in both rat and rabbit kidney (10Karbach U. Kricke J. Meyer-Wentrup F.

Dantzler W.H. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1149-F1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, the relative functional expression of OCT1 and OCT2 has only been established in the mouse (8Jonker J.W. Wagenaar E. Van Eijl S. Schinkel A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7902-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and rabbit (12Wright S.H. Evans K.K. Zhang X. Cherrington N.J. Sitar D.S. Dantzler W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: F442-F451Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with clear evidence indicating that both OCT1 and OCT2 can play a quantitatively significant role in OC secretion. Nevertheless, OCT2, which interacts with a variety of OCs, including many clinically used drugs (e.g. procainamide and cimetidine), hormones (e.g. norepinephrine and dopamine), and toxic substances (e.g. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)), evidently plays a key role in all species in governing the entry of OCs from the blood into the renal tubule, thereby controlling the first step in renal secretion of OCs. The orthologs of OCT1 and OCT2 have been cloned from human (13Zhang L. Dresser M.J. Gray A.T. Yost S.C. Terashita S. Giacomini K.M. Mol.

Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1369: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 283: F124-F133Google Scholar), and in each species, these homologs share ∼70% amino acid identity and >90% sequence similarity. This high degree of shared structure is consistent with the shared functional characteristics of these homologous transporters. Indeed, there is strong evidence supporting the contention that these transporters arose by gene duplication (21Eraly S.A. Monte J.C. Nigam S.K. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 18: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, despite the similar affinities for some substrates generally observed between OCT1 and OCT2 homologs in any of these species (e.g. for TEA) (11Kaewmokul S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Dantzler W.H. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1149-F1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), these transporters are typically distinguished from one another by markedly different affinities for selected substrates (11Kaewmokul S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Dantzler W.H. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1149-F1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Arndt P. Volk C. Gorboulev V. Budiman T. Popp C. Ulzheimer-Teuber I. Akhoundova A. Koppatz S. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F454-F468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These differences in selectivity presumably reflect differences in the identity of a subset of the amino acid residues that distinguish OCT1 from OCT2 homologs. Here, we have tested the hypothesis that shifts in selectivity of OCT2 toward a more OCT1-like phenotype will result from mutation of one or more of the residues that distinguish these two homologous proteins. We identified one such residue in OCT2 (Glu447 in the rabbit ortholog) that exerted a marked influence on substrate selectivity. This observation has been interpreted in light of a proposed homology model of the structure of rabbit OCT2 and a recently described model of the structure of rat OCT1 (23Popp C. Gorboulev V. Muller T. Gorbunov D. Shatskaya N. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1600-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), both of which are based upon recent developments in the understanding of the structure of proteins in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters. Preparation of Site-directed Mutants—Wild-type rabbit (rb) OCT2 was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector as described previously (20Zhang X. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 283: F124-F133Google Scholar). To facilitate the immunocytochemical localization of expressed mutants within transiently transfected cells, the V5 epitope tag (amino acid sequence GKPIPNPLLGLDST, nucleotide sequence GGT AAG CCT ATC CCT AAC CCT CTC CTC GGT CTC GAT TCT ACG) was added to the C terminus of rbOCT2 using PCR amplification. Mutations of the V5-tagged rbOCT2 sequence were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was prepared using standard methods (Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA). The final plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation and the absence of PCR artifacts. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2) in plastic culture flasks. The medium was Kaighn's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cultures were split every 3 days. Cells were transfected via electroporation (ECM 630, BTX, San Diego, CA) with a plasmid containing the cDNA sequence for the desired construct. Briefly, cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA at 260 V (time constant of ∼25 ms) and seeded onto 12-well plates at 320,000 cells/well. Uptake was typically measured 48 h after transfection, after the cells had reached confluence. Measurement of Transport—CHO cells were incubated at room temperature (∼25 °C) in Waymouth buffer (135 mm NaCl, 13 mm HEPESNaOH, pH 7.4, 28 mm d-glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.8 mm MgSO4) to which labeled substrate and appropriate test agents were added. Uptake was stopped by rinsing the cells three times with 2 ml of ice-cold Waymouth buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 400 μl of 0.5 n NaOH with 1% (v/v) SDS. (The extract was neutralized with 200 μl of 1 n HCl.) Accumulated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Rates of uptake are expressed as moles/cm2 of nominal cell surface of the confluent monolayer. Immunocytochemistry—CHO cells were electroporated with plasmid DNA containing the various epitope-tagged sequences and seeded onto coverslips. Immunocytochemistry was generally performed on a confluent monolayer 24 h after plating. Cells were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 20 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.0 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mm KH2PO4,pH8;all washes were done in triplicate), and incubated for 1 h with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in PBS. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h in the dark with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Western Blotting—Crude CHO membranes were prepared as described (24Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McIlhinney R.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Thirty micrograms of total membrane protein was separated on a 10% Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 6% milk in PBS at room temperature, followed by incubation overnight with anti-V5 antibody (1:5000 dilution) at 4 °C. After extensive washing with 0.05% PBS/Tween, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega Corp.). The secondary antibody was detected with the SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate kit (Pierce). Homology Modeling of the Three-dimensional Structure of rbOCT2— The rbOCT2 sequence was used as a “probe” to search homologous sequences (PSI-BLAST, NCBI Database) and sequence-based structural relatives (3D-PSSM) (26Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). GlpT (Protein Data Bank code 1PW4) and LacY (code 1PV6) were returned as the top hits in both search algorithms. Notably, although the sequence identity (between rbOCT2 and GlpT or LacY) was low (<15%), the sequence similarity was ∼50%. The transmembrane α-helices of rbOCT2 were predicted using TMHMM (27Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar). The putative transmembrane-spanning helices (TMHs) of rbOCT2 were then aligned with the respective α-helices of LacY and GlpT using ClustalW. In parallel, we also computed the hydropathy plots and helical wheel plots. These suggested that TMH1 and TMH12 were not aligned correctly with respect to the crystal structures. Significantly, the highly conserved motifs that fall between TMH2 and TMH3 and between TMH7 and TMH8 of MFS proteins (28Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were well aligned between the rbOCT2 and GlpT sequences. Based on these factors, we performed some deletions and modifications to fine-tune the sequence alignment. The final sequence alignment was used for target-template homology modeling, which was performed using ICM 3.0 (MolSoft L.L.C., La Jolla, CA). The model was refined in SYBYL 6.9 (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) using the Powell method (29Powell M.J.D. Math. Program. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1432) Google Scholar), and the minimization routine was run for 7000 cycles. The model was validated using PRO-CHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), WHATIF (31Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), and PROVE (32Pontius J. Richelle J. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Statistics—All data are expressed as means ± S.E., with calculations of standard errors based on the number of separate experiments. Statistical comparisons were performed using either a t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed by a Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test (ProStat 3.81, Poly Software International, Pearl River, NY). Multiple alignment of the human, rat, mouse, and rabbit orthologs of OCT1 and OCT2 revealed 24 residues that are conserved in all orthologs of OCT2 as one amino acid, but are conserved as a different amino acid in all orthologs of OCT1. Most of these conserved differences involve either strongly or weakly similar amino acids, e.g. F23L (OCT2 to OCT1) and L249V. However, seven involve residues with comparatively different physicochemical characteristics, e.g. a charged residue replaced with a neutral residue or a polar residue replaced with a lipophilic residue. We further narrowed our focus to residues found in the C-terminal half of OCT2 in light of several studies that implicated the C-terminal half as playing a major role in influencing selectivity of SLC22A family members (33Feng B. Dresser M.J. Shu Y. Johns S.J. Giacomini K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Gorboulev V. Shatskaya N. Volk C. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1612-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consequently, our initial work, described here, focused on three residues in the C-terminal half of OCT2 (N353L, R403I, and E447Q) and the influence on OCT2 selectivity of mutating these residues from their conserved OCT2 identity to that expressed in OCT1. Effect of Mutations on the Kinetics of Substrate Interaction—We elected to use the rabbit ortholog of OCT2 to assess the influence of the selected mutations on transport activity because rbOCT2 generally displays a greater degree of homolog-specific selectivity over rbOCT1 than noted for the human orthologs of these transporters (35Suhre W.M. Ekins S. Chang C. Swaan P.W. Wright S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In particular, the >20-fold difference in affinity for cimetidine that distinguishes rbOCT2 from rbOCT1 (11Kaewmokul S. Chatsudthipong V. Evans K.K. Dantzler W.H. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1149-F1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Evans K.K. Wright S.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 283: F124-F133Google Scholar) was anticipated as being a valuable tool for determining the bases of such differences in selectivity. We also reasoned that structural information gained from the study of rbOCT orthologs is likely to be relevant to understanding the structure of OCTs in other species as well. Fig. 1 compares the uptake of [3H]TEA by wild-type rbOCT2 with that supported by the N353L, R403I, and E447Q single, double, and triple mutants of rbOCT2. Each mutant displayed significant transport of TEA. Uptake into transiently transfected CHO cells was nearly linear for at least 5 min (data not shown), and 5-min uptakes were generally used to generate initial rates of transport for kinetic analyses. OCT1 and OCT2 have a similar apparent affinity for TEA (Kt = 141 and 165 μm, respectively; p > 0.05) (TABLE ONE; see also Ref. 22Arndt P. Volk C. Gorboulev V. Budiman T. Popp C. Ulzheimer-Teuber I. Akhoundova A. Koppatz S. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Koepsell H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F454-F468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that replacing OCT2-specific residues with those found in OCT1 would have comparatively little effect on the affinity of the mutant transporter for TEA. As shown in Fig. 2 and TABLE ONE, this proved to be the case: although there was a general trend for a slight increase in apparent affinity of some of the mutant transporters for TEA (i.e. a decrease in IC50), it was not significant. We did expect, however, that one or more of the residue replacements would result in a decrease in affinity for cimetidine and for the fluorescent cation N,N,N-trimethyl-2-(methyl(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino)ethanaminium iodide (NBD-MTMA) (36Bednarczyk D. Mash E.A. Aavula B.R. Wright S.H. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 184-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. a shift toward a more “OCT1-like” selectivity. This proved to be the case: although neither the N353L nor R403I mutation by itself resulted in a significant change in the IC50 for inhibition of TEA uptake by cimetidine and NBD-MTMA, every protein that included the E447Q mutation displayed a significant decrease in apparent affinity for cimetidine and NBD-MTMA (Fig. 2). The IC50 for cimetidine inhibition of TEA uptake by the E447Q mutant was increased >15-fold (from 2.1 to 33.4 μm; p < 0.05), and that for NBDMTMA was increased 2.5-fold (from 11.6 to 28.3 μm; p < 0.05). The inclusion of both the E447Q and N353I conversions produced a further decrease in apparent affinity for both cimetidine (IC50 increase from 33.4 to 104 μm) and NBD-MTMA (from 28.0 to 78.9 μm) (p < 0.05). Interestingly, the affinity of the N353I/R403I/E447Q triple mutant for both cimetidine and NBD-MTMA did not differ significantly from that displayed by OCT1.TABLE ONEKinetic characteristics of site-directed rbOCT2 mutants Listed below are the Kt values for [3H]TEA uptake and the IC50 values for CIM and NBD-MTMA inhibition of [3H]TEA uptake mediated by single, double, and triple site-directed mutants of rbOCT2.

Consequently, we examined in more detail the influence of replacing Glu447 with other amino acids. Not surprisingly, replacement of the anionic glutamate with cationic residues, i.e. arginine and lysine, exerted a profound effect on activity of the resulting mutant. In fact, we could detect no transport of either TEA or the anionic substrate p-aminohippurate (PAH) by these constructs (data not shown). The failure to support transport did not appear to reflect a failure of the constructs to be synthesized following transfection; as shown in Fig. 3 (left panel), a Western blot of crude membranes isolated from CHO cells transiently transfected with a plasmid containing the E447R mutant revealed what appeared to be an even higher degree of synthesis of the mutant protein compared with the wild-type protein. The absence of transport activity did not appear to reflect a failure of these mutants to be inserted into the plasma membrane; immunocytochemical localization of E447K and E447R showed a distribution of the mutant proteins that was similar to that observed for both the wild-type protein and the functional E447Q mutant (Fig. 3, right panels). Although we cannot reject the idea that the mutant protein was restricted to an intracellular compartment just below the plasma membrane, it was clearly not confined to the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum, as might be expected if the mutant protein was misfolded. Replacement of Glu447 with either leucine or alanine was also associated with markedly decreased TEA transport. However, despite a profound reduction in TEA transport, we noted that both E447L and E447A retained the ability to accumulate the fluorescent cation NBDMTMA (data not shown). Consequently, we examined the characteristics of one of these mutants, i.e. E447L, in more detail. Fig. 4 compares the rates of TEA, MPP+, and cimetidine transport into CHO cells that stably expressed either rbOCT2 or the E447L mutant of rbOCT2. Although OCT2 supported transport of TEA, cimetidine, and MPP+, the E447L mutant displayed a profound reduction in the rate of both TEA and cimetidine transport, but retained nearly normal transport of MPP+. Indeed, the Kt for MPP+ +transport by the E447L mutant (8.8 ± 1.29 μm) was not significantly different from that of OCT2 (16.4 ± 1.80 μm) (Fig. 5B). The reduced rates of TEA and cimetidine transport in the E447L mutant could involve changes in the apparent affinity of the transporter for these substrates or in their maximum rate of transport or a combination of the two effects. Unfortunately, the rate of TEA transport into CHO cells expressing the E447L mutant was sufficiently low that the kinetics could not be measured with confidence. Consequently, the apparent affinity of OCT2 and its E447L mutant for TEA was estimated by determining the IC50 for TEA inhibition of MPP+ transport mediated by both transporters. As shown in Fig. 5A, the E447L mutation decreased the apparent affinity for TEA as shown by the significant increase in the IC50 for inhibition of MPP+ transport, from a control value of 83 ± 16.0 μm to 750 ± 127.3 μm. (Note that the IC50 for TEA inhibition of OCT-mediated MPP+ transport did not differ significantly from the Kt for TEA transport, as expected.) Given the very large decrease in TEA uptake measured in the E447L mutant in the face of maintained rates of MPP+ uptake (Fig. 4), we think it likely that the mutation also produced a substantial decrease in turnover number of the transporter when bound to TEA. This contention is further supported by the interesting observation that, although the rate of cimetidine transport was markedly reduced in the E447L mutant (Fig. 4), its apparent affinity for cimetidine (9.0 ± 0.73 μm), as determined in lines of CHO cells that stably expressed either the wild-type transporter or the E447L mutant, remained comparable with that of wild-type rbOCT2 (16.9 ± 2.48 μm) (Fig. 5C). Thus, although retaining a structure consistent with comparatively high affinity binding to cimetidine, the presence of leucine at position 447 may have caused a change in protein structure that resulted in reduced turnover of the transporter-substrate complex.FIGURE 5Inhibition of 16 nm [3H]MPP+ uptake by wild-type rbOCT2 (○) and the E447L mutant (♦) produced by increasing concentrations of unlabeled TEA (A), MPP+ (B), and cimetidine (C).

https://openalex.org/W2021548175,"Abstract Factor XIa (FXIa) is a serine protease important for initiating the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Protease nexin 2 (PN2) is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor secreted by activated platelets and a physiologically important inhibitor of FXIa. Inhibition of FXIa by PN2 requires interactions between the two proteins that are confined to the catalytic domain of the enzyme and the Kunitz protease inhibitor (KPI) domain of PN2. Recombinant PN2KPI and a mutant form of the FXI catalytic domain (FXIac) were expressed in yeast, purified to homogeneity, co-crystallized, and the structure of the complex was solved at 2.6 A (Protein Data Bank code 1ZJD). In this complex, PN2KPI has a characteristic, disulfide-stabilized double loop structure that fits into the FXIac active site. To determine the contributions of residues within PN2KPI to its inhibitory activity, selected point mutations in PN2KPI loop 1 11TGPCRAMISR20 and loop 2 34FYGGC38 were tested for their ability to inhibit FXIa. The P1 site mutation R15A completely abolished its ability to inhibit FXIa. IC50 values for the wild type protein and the remaining mutants were as follows: PN2KPI WT, 1.28 nm; P13A, 5.92 nm; M17A, 1.62 nm; S19A, 1.86 nm; R20A, 5.67 nm; F34A, 9.85 nm. The IC50 values for the M17A and S19A mutants were not significantly different from those obtained with wild type PN2KPI. These functional studies and activated partial thromboplastin time analysis validate predictions made from the PN2KPI-FXIac co-crystal structure and implicate PN2KPI residues, in descending order of importance, Arg15, Phe34, Pro13, and Arg20 in FXIa inhibition by PN2KPI."
https://openalex.org/W2119941807,"l-Arginine deiminase (ADI) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of l-arginine to citrulline and ammonia. In a previous report of the structure of apoADI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the four residues that form the catalytic motif were identified as Cys406, His278, Asp280, and Asp166. The function of Cys406 in nucleophilic catalysis has been demonstrated by transient kinetic studies. In this study, the structure of the C406A mutant in complex with l-arginine is reported to provide a snapshot of the enzyme·substrate complex. Through the comparison of the structures of apoenzyme and substrate-bound enzyme, a substrate-induced conformational transition, which might play an important role in activity regulation, was discovered. Furthermore, the position of the guanidinium group of the bound substrate relative to the side chains of His278,Asp280, and Asp166 indicated that these residues mediate multiple proton transfers. His278 and Asp280, which are positioned to activate the water nucleophile in the hydrolysis of the S-alkylthiouronium intermediate, were replaced with alanine to stabilize the intermediate for structure determination. The structures determined for the H278A and D280A mutants co-crystallized with l-arginine provide a snapshot of the S-alkylthiouronium adduct formed by attack of Cys406 on the guanidinium carbon of l-arginine followed by the elimination of ammonia. Asp280 and Asp166 engage in ionic interactions with the guanidinium group in the C406A ADI·l-arginine structure and might orient the reaction center and participate in proton transfer. Structure determination of D166A revealed the apoD166A ADI. The collection of structures is interpreted in the context of recent biochemical data to propose a model for ADI substrate recognition and catalysis. l-Arginine deiminase (ADI) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolysis of l-arginine to citrulline and ammonia. In a previous report of the structure of apoADI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the four residues that form the catalytic motif were identified as Cys406, His278, Asp280, and Asp166. The function of Cys406 in nucleophilic catalysis has been demonstrated by transient kinetic studies. In this study, the structure of the C406A mutant in complex with l-arginine is reported to provide a snapshot of the enzyme·substrate complex. Through the comparison of the structures of apoenzyme and substrate-bound enzyme, a substrate-induced conformational transition, which might play an important role in activity regulation, was discovered. Furthermore, the position of the guanidinium group of the bound substrate relative to the side chains of His278,Asp280, and Asp166 indicated that these residues mediate multiple proton transfers. His278 and Asp280, which are positioned to activate the water nucleophile in the hydrolysis of the S-alkylthiouronium intermediate, were replaced with alanine to stabilize the intermediate for structure determination. The structures determined for the H278A and D280A mutants co-crystallized with l-arginine provide a snapshot of the S-alkylthiouronium adduct formed by attack of Cys406 on the guanidinium carbon of l-arginine followed by the elimination of ammonia. Asp280 and Asp166 engage in ionic interactions with the guanidinium group in the C406A ADI·l-arginine structure and might orient the reaction center and participate in proton transfer. Structure determination of D166A revealed the apoD166A ADI. The collection of structures is interpreted in the context of recent biochemical data to propose a model for ADI substrate recognition and catalysis. l-Arginine is used by a number of pathogenic microorganisms to generate ATP via the arginine dihydrolase pathway (1Zuniga M.

Arginine deiminase (ADI 2The abbreviations used are: ADI, arginine deiminase; PaADI, ADI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa; McADI, ADI from Mycoplasma arginii; Pad4, peptidylarginine deiminase; DDAH, dimethylarginine hydrolase; r.m.s.d., root-mean-square deviation.; EC 3.5.3.6) (Fig. 1A) catalyzes the first step of the pathway, wherein arginine is hydrolyzed to citrulline and ammonia. The gene encoding ADI is absent in humans, whereas the enzyme is essential for the survival of pathogenic protozoa and bacteria. Thus, ADI is an attractive antimicrobial drug target candidate. ADI is also a potential anti-angiogenic agent (3Beloussow K. Wang L. Wu J. Ann D. Shen W.C. Cancer Lett. 2002; 183: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and an antileukemic and nonleukemic murine tumor agent (4Wheatley D.N. Campbell E. Pathol. Oncol. Res. 2002; 8: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have previously determined the crystal structure of ADI from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaADI) in its unbound state (5Galkin A. Kulakova L. Sarikaya E. Lim K. Howard A. Herzberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14001-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of significant amino acid sequence homology, the core domain structure is similar to those of other arginine-modifying or substituted arginine-modifying enzymes, Nω,Nω-dimethylarginine hydrolase (DDAH) (6Murray-Rust J.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Based on the structural similarity and conservation of several key residues in the active site of DDAH and ADI, we proposed a model of arginine binding to ADI in which the guanidinium group is positioned in close proximity to the catalytic Cys406 (5Galkin A. Kulakova L. Sarikaya E. Lim K. Howard A. Herzberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14001-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Three other residues are in close proximity to the guanidinium group of the substrate: His278, Asp280, and Asp166. The structural data suggested a nucleophilic attack by the thiol group of Cys406 on the guanidinium carbon of the arginine substrate. The role of Cys406 in nucleophilic catalysis was supported by demonstrating the formation of a covalent adduct between Cys406 and the substrate, using a combination of an intermediate trapping and rapid quench techniques with radiolabeled l-[1-14C]arginine (10Lu X. Galkin A. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5374-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reactions of either C406A ADI or C406S ADI failed to produce a 14C-labeled intermediate, thereby providing evidence of the essential role of Cys406 in nucleophilic catalysis. The structure of the ADI from Mycoplasma arginii (McADI) has also been described (11Das K. Butler G.H. Kwiatkowski V. Clark Jr., A.D. Yadav P. Arnold E. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The enzyme was co-crystallized with arginine, which gave rise to two different complexes, a tetrahedral adduct and a S-alkylthiouronium adduct. McADI shares 28% sequence identity with PaADI. In the present work, we focused on obtaining the structure of the PaADI·l-arginine complex so that we could identify conformational changes that occur upon substrate binding and determine the orientation of substrate binding and catalytic groups in the enzyme·substrate complex. The strategy for structure determination employed the C406A mutant, which we had shown in earlier work to be inactive (10Lu X. Galkin A. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5374-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The C406A-arginine structure guided the design of active site mutants in which substrate activation and/or general acid/base catalysis might be impaired. Specifically the H278A, D166A, and D180A mutants were prepared and subjected to kinetic analysis (the results of which are reported in a separate paper) 3X. Lu, L. Li, X. Feng, A. Galkin, O. Herzberg, P. S. Mariano, and D. Dunaway-Mariano, submitted for publication. and to crystallization in the presence of l-arginine followed by x-ray structure determination. The structures reported in this paper, are interpreted in the context of the biochemical data to support a model for PaADI substrate recognition and catalysis. Crystallization and Data Collection—The expression construct pET100/ADIn coding for wild-type untagged protein was used for production of ADI mutants (5Galkin A. Kulakova L. Sarikaya E. Lim K. Howard A. Herzberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14001-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out and the recombinant mutant proteins prepared as described elsewhere (10Lu X. Galkin A. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5374-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).3 Crystals of ADI mutants were obtained by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops at room temperature. Protein solutions containing 20 mm arginine were mixed with an equal volume of mother liquor containing 34-38% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 6.0-7.0% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and 20 mm arginine and equilibrated against the mother liquor reservoir. Crystals appeared within 2-8 weeks and grew to ∼0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm3. For data collection, the crystals in their solution were flush-cooled in liquid propane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were acquired at 100 K using an RAXIS IV++ image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator (Rigaku MSC Inc.). Data processing was carried out using CrystalClear, version 1.3.5 (Rigaku MSC Inc.).

The structures were therefore determined by molecular replacement techniques with the computer program CNS (crystallography NMR software) (13Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), using the ADI apostructure (Protein Data Bank code 1RXX) as the search model. The difference Fourier maps indicated some alternative tracing. Structure refinement was carried out using the CNS program. The four molecules in the asymmetric unit were refined independently. The resulting models were inspected and modified on a graphics work station using the program O (14Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added to the model based on the Fo - Fc difference Fourier electron density map (where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively), using peaks with density ≥ 3σ as the acceptance criteria. PROCHECK was used for analysis of geometry (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), QUANTA for molecular modeling and structural alignment (Molecular Simulations Inc.), and PYMOL for depiction of the structures (16DeLano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). The first goal of this work was to obtain a structure of the ADI active site with substrate bound. In a previous study, the C406A mutant, devoid of the active site nucleophile, was shown to be catalytically inert (10Lu X. Galkin A. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5374-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the C406A mutant was co-crystallized with l-arginine at pH 7.6 for x-ray structure determination. The second goal of this work was to probe the role of key catalytic residues (His278, Asp280, and Asp166) and to obtain the structures of ADI at various stages along reaction pathway by co-crystallization of mutants of these residues with l-arginine. The H278A, D280A, and D166A ADI mutants, which catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to citrulline at a negligible rate (106-107-fold slower than the wild-type enzyme),3 were co-crystallized with l-arginine at pH 7.6. The x-ray crystal structures obtained are described below. Refinement results are summarized in TABLE ONE, and electron density maps in the vicinity of the active side are shown in Fig. 2. All structures of the mutant ADIs contain four protein molecules in the asymmetric unit: A, B, C, and D. The molecules pack into tetramers with approximate 222 symmetry of the noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry axes. The four ADI structures are as follows. The C406A ADI·l-Arginine Complex—The active site is occupied by an intact l-arginine (Fig. 2A). The model includes 1618 amino acid residues and 1064 water molecules. Pairwise superposition of monomers results in a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between the α-carbon positions of 0.4 Å. The five N-terminal residues of each molecule are not visible in the electron density map. In addition, no electron density is associated with the following surface residues: 345-351, and 418 in molecule A; 275-276, 345-348, and 417-418 in molecule B; 273-275, 345-351, and 418 in molecule C; 346-351 and 418 in molecule D. These residues were omitted from the final model. H278A ADI·S-Alkylthiouronium Intermediate Complex—The model (Fig. 2B) includes 1626 amino acid residues and 802 water molecules. Superposition of monomers yields a r.m.s.d. of α-carbon positions in the range of 0.4 to 0.8 Å. The five N-terminal residues of each molecule are not visible in the electron density map. In addition, no electron density is associated with the following surface residues: 345-351 and 418 in molecule A; 345-348 in molecule B; 345-350 in molecule C; 345-351 in molecule D. These residues were omitted from the final model. D280A ADI-S-Alkylthiouronium Intermediate—The model (Fig. 2C) contains 1613 amino acid residues. The crystals obtained for this mutant were fragile and very sensitive to manipulations. They diffracted only to resolution of 2.9 Å and had high mosaic spread (2.3°). Therefore no water molecules were added to the model. The monomers exhibit a r.m.s.d. between superposed α-carbon atoms in the range of 0.4 and 0.5 Å. The five N-terminal residues of each molecule are not visible in the electron density map. In addition, no electron density is associated with the following residues: 274-276, 345-351, and 418 in molecule A; 273-274, 345-348, and 418 in molecule B; 6, 274-275, 345-350, and 418 in molecule C; 275-276, 345-351, and 417-418 in molecule D. These residues were omitted from the final model. ApoD166A ADI—The model (Fig. 2D) contains 1620 amino acid residues and 300 water molecules. The monomers exhibit a r.m.s.d. between superposed α-carbon atoms in the range of 0.4 to 0.5 Å. The five N-terminal residues of each molecule are not visible in the electron density map. In addition, electron density is missing for the following residues: 273-275, 345-351, and 418 in molecule A; 345-348 in molecule B; 6, 274-275, 345-350, and 418 in molecule C; 345-351 in molecule D. These residues were omitted from the final model. Pairwise superposition of the free wild-type ADI and the mutant enzyme·substrate complexes show that the overall fold of the structures remains similar, yet with some local changes that result in r.m.s.d. values between α-carbon atoms that range between 0.6 and 0.8 Å. In particular, four loops associated with the active site undergo conformational transitions not related to crystal packing: loop 1 comprising residues 30-46, loop 2 comprising residues 178-185, loop 3 comprising residues 271-281 (part of this loop is disordered in the apoADI structure), and loop 4 comprising residues 393-404 (Fig. 3A). Residues adjacent to the substrate exhibit the most significant shifts. For example, the α-carbon atom of Leu41 (loop 1) shifts by 2.7 Å and that of Arg185 (loop 2) by 1.8 Å; the α-carbon atom of His278 (loop 3) shifts by 0.9 Å and that of Gly400 (loop 4) by 4.4 Å. These are localized but mechanistically important conformational transitions that tighten the surrounding of the substrate. Simultaneously, substrate binding is accompanied by displacement of the side chain of Arg401 (loop 4) by more than 8 Å to enable access to the active site (Fig. 3B). The significance of the Arg401 side chain movement is discussed below. The difference Fourier electron density maps clearly show bound ligands for three mutant ADIs, C406A, H278A, and D280A, but not for the D166A mutant (Fig. 2). The structure of the H278A ADI complex was refined at higher resolution than that of D280A ADI, and both represent a S-alkylthiouronium reaction intermediate in which the guanidinium group of the l-arginine substrate forms an amidino adduct with Cys406. In the following discussion, the more accurate H278A ADI structure is used for illustration. The ADI active site lies in the center of a barrel formed by a cyclic arrangement of five ββαβ modules (Fig. 3A). Residues involved in a hydrogen bonding network with l-arginine are shown in Fig. 4. As discussed previously (5Galkin A. Kulakova L. Sarikaya E. Lim K. Howard A. Herzberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14001-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Das K. Butler G.H. Kwiatkowski V. Clark Jr., A.D. Yadav P. Arnold E. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the ADI active site organization is similar to that of the other enzymes of the superfamily: DDAH, PAD4, arginine: inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase, and arginine:glycine amidinotransferase. However, the substrate orientation in arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and arginine:inosamine-phosphate amidinotransferase is different compared with that of DDAH (6Murray-Rust J. Leiper J. McAlister M. Phelan J. Tilley S. Santa Maria J. Vallance P. McDonald N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 7Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), PAD4 (9Arita K. Hashimoto H. Shimizu T. Nakashima K. Yamada M. Sato M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and ADI. Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and arginine:inosaminephosphate amidinotransferase catalyze the amidino group transfer of arginine to a second substrate, producing the amidino derivatives of the substrates and ornithine (Fig. 1). The Cζ-Nϵ bond of the arginine is cleaved in these reactions. In contrast, DDAH, PAD4, and ADI are hydrolytic enzymes, catalyzing the Cζ-Nη bond cleavage. In ADI, the l-arginine substrate binds such that the guanidinium group exposes opposite faces to the Cys406 and His278 side chains (Fig. 4, A and B). In the H278A and D280A ADI structures, the Cys406 sulfur atom is covalently linked to the guanidinium group Cζ atom of the substrate, replacing its NH2 substituent. In the C406A, H278A, and D280A ADI structures, the guanidinium group of the ligand interacts with the carboxylate groups of Asp166 and Asp280 (except that one carboxylate group is missing in D280A ADI). The aliphatic portion of the ligand interacts with Phe163 (Fig. 2, A-C), and the Cα-carboxyl group forms ionic interactions with Arg185 and Arg243 (Fig. 4, A and B). The Cα-amino group of the ligand is fixed by electrostatic interactions with the main chain oxygen atoms of Leu41 and Gly400 and with the oxygen atom of the amide group of Asn160. Enzyme activity is exquisitely sensitive to amino acid replacements of the polar substrate binding residues, as demonstrated elsewhere.3 The overall reaction catalyzed by ADI is the hydrolytic substitution of the ηNH2 group from the guanidinium group Cζ of l-arginine, leading to citrulline and ammonia (Fig. 1). The role of Cys406 in nucleophilic catalysis is well supported by experimental data. First, single turnover reactions carried out with PaADI and l-[14C]arginine have demonstrated a kinetically competent covalent enzyme intermediate that forms in the wild-type ADI but not in the C406A or C406S ADI mutants (10Lu X. Galkin A. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5374-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The covalent adduct was presumed to be the Cys406-S-alkythiouronium intermediate (Fig. 5, depicted in complexes III and IV). The x-ray structure of the C406A ADI·l-arginine complex, described in the previous section, shows that the side chain of the Cys406 residue would be positioned for addition to the guanidinium group Cζ of the l-arginine ligand in the enzyme·substrate complex. Second, Arnold and co-workers (11Das K. Butler G.H. Kwiatkowski V. Clark Jr., A.D. Yadav P. Arnold E. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) observed intermediates linked to the active site cysteine of wild-type McADI. One intermediate was the tetrahedral adduct (Fig. 5, complex V), and the second was the Cys-S-alkythiouronium intermediate (Fig. 5, complex IV) attributed to the back reaction that occurs when citrulline accumulates. Third, in a recent study of the reaction of DDAH with the substrate analog S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline, the Cys249-S-alkythiouronium intermediate was captured at steady state by acid quench and characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (17Stone E.M. Person M.D. Costello N.J. Fast W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7069-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fourth, in this study we have determined the structure of the PaADI Cys406-S-alkythiouronium intermediate formed by co-crystallization of l-arginine and the H278A or D280A mutant emzymes. Solution studies show that the rate of citrulline formation by these two mutants is extremely slow,3 which indicates that without the His278 or without the Asp280 residues, ADI is unable to hydrolyze the Cys406-S-alkythiouronium intermediate efficiently. Finally, the demonstrated stability of the S-alkythiouronium model in water and in aqueous acid3 indicates that the covalent adduct observed in the crystal is indeed the thiouronium intermediate and not the Cys406-S-alkylthiocabamate adduct formed as a dead-end product by in situ hydrolysis of the S-alkythiouronium intermediate. It follows that the hydrolysis of the S-alkythiouronium intermediate requires activation of the water nucleophile. The active site is enriched with charged and polar groups, and the ionization states of the key catalytic residues are unknown. In previous work we have shown that the PaADI is optimally active at acidic pH (below pH 6), and yet Mycoplasma arthritidis ADI is known to function at or above pH 7 even though the two enzymes utilize the same constellation of catalytic groups (18Weickmann J.L. Fahrney D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2615-2620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the l-arginine binds to PaADI, the positively charged guanidinium group is positioned in between His278 and Cys406 and thereby perturbs the local electrostatic environment of these catalytic groups. The ionization state of His278 is further modulated by its electrostatic interaction with Glu224, which we know from kinetic analysis of the E224D and E224A mutants to contribute 3 orders of magnitude to the turnover rate (kcat).3 Asp280 is also involved in an intricate interaction network, which includes the buried residues His405, Arg165, and Glu13 (Fig. 4C). Of these four residues, Asp280 and Glu13 are invariant in all known ADIs, and His405 is sometimes replaced by an arginine, as in the case of McADI. The precise side chain orientation and the network of interactions indicate that His405 shares protons with Asp280 and with Glu13 and is likely to be protonated. This may explain the low pH optimum of PaADI (5.6) in contrast to the neutral pH optimum of McADI, the enzyme that contains an arginine residue instead of His405. The presence of another invariant residue, Arg165, in which the guanidinium group stacks against the His405 imidazolium ring, further complicates the charge distribution (Fig. 4C). This is an exquisite arrangement, in which the position of the guanidinium group is supported by the interaction of one ηNH2 atom with Thr408 Oγ, the second ηNH2 interacting with an internal water molecule bridged to Glu13, and the Nϵ atom interacting with His405 backbone carbonyl. A survey of the Protein Data Bank showed that the stacking of His-Arg side chains is the most commonly observed geometry of such pairs (19Bhattacharyya R. Saha R.P. Samanta U. Chakrabarti P. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We speculate that the stacking of the Arg165-His405 pair is mediated by π electrons and dictates the precise positioning of the imidazolium ring of His405 between the two acidic groups of Glu13 and Asp280, which in turn fixes the orientation of Asp280 carboxyl group with respect to the guanidinium group of the substrate. Based on the new information provided by the structures of the complexes, we have modified slightly the previous reaction mechanism proposed by us (5Galkin A. Kulakova L. Sarikaya E. Lim K. Howard A. Herzberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14001-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and independently by Arnold and colleagues (11Das K. Butler G.H. Kwiatkowski V. Clark Jr., A.D. Yadav P. Arnold E. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We might assume that the first step is initiated by the Cys406 thiolate group mounting a nucleophilic attack on the guanidinium group Cζ atom, leading to the tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 5, complex II). This step is followed by a proton transfer to the ηNH2 group, cleavage of the Cζ-Nη bond, and the formation of the Cys406-S-alkylthiouronium intermediate concomitant with release of NH3 (Fig. 5, complex III). Acid catalysis is required, and the structures of the McADI tetrahedral adduct and of the C406A PaADI·l-arginine complex show that His278 is best oriented for this role. The implication is that His278 is positively charged. The role of His278 in acid catalysis is consistent with, but not dictated by, the reduction in rate of S-alkylthiouronium intermediate formation observed with the H278A PaADI.3 The roles of Asp166 and Asp280 appear to be different, although both are required for citrulline formation.3 The observation that D166A PaADI does not co-crystallize with the l-arginine is consistent with its role in substrate binding, which is evident from the structure of the C406A-PaADI·l-arginine complex. In contrast, D280A PaADI binds l-arginine to produce the S-alkylthiouronium intermediate, indicating that its primary role is in enhancement of the nucleophilicity of the Cζ atom and activation of the hydrolytic water molecule, as described below, and not in countering the charge of the l-arginine guanidinium group. The kinetic characterization using [14C]arginine supports the crystallographic results, as it shows no accumulation of [14C]D166A ADI, in contrast to the accumulation of [14C]D280A enzyme.3 Next, the departing NH3 is replaced by a hydrolytic water molecule. In PaADI, His278 is positioned to bind and deprotonate the water nucleophile, and the analogous residue in McADI is His269. The S-alkylthiouronium intermediate of McADI"

In this study, we found syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4 to be constitutively expressed by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The exposure of the ectodomains of syndecan-1 and -4 to the cell surface and their constitutive shedding into the extracellular compartment was measured by immunoassays. In the presence of plasmin and thrombin, shedding was accelerated and monitored by detection and identification of 35S-labeled proteoglycans. To elucidate the cleavage site of the syndecan ectodomains, we used a cell-free in vitro system with enzyme and substrate as the only reactants. For this purpose, we constructed recombinant fusion proteins of the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomain together with maltose-binding protein and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein as reporter proteins attached to the N and C termini via oligopeptide linkers. After protease treatment of the fusion proteins, the electrophoretically resolved split products were sequenced and cleavage sites of the ectodomain were identified. Plasmin generated cleavage sites at Lys114↓Arg115 and Lys129↓Val130 in the ectodomain of syndecan-4. In thrombin proteolysates of the syndecan-4 ectodomain, the cleavage site Lys114↓Arg115 was also identified. The cleavage sites for plasmin and thrombin within the syndecan-4 ectodomain were not present in the syndecan-1 ectodomain. Cleavage of the syndecan-1 fusion protein by thrombin occurred only at a control cleavage site (Arg↓Gly) introduced into the linker region connecting the ectodomain with the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Because both plasmin and thrombin are involved in thrombogenic and thrombolytic processes in the course of the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis, the detachment of heparan sulfate-bearing ectodomains could be relevant for the development of arteriosclerotic plaques and recruitment of mononuclear blood cells to the plaque.

The family of syndecans forms a group of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that are composed of a core protein with covalently attached glycosaminoglycan chains. The four mammalian syndecan genes (syndecan-1, -2, -3, -4) have been cloned and sequenced and are expressed in most human cells and tissues (for review, see Refs. 1Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W.

The syndecans contain an N-terminal extracellular domain or ectodomain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The ectodomain bears, near the N terminus, three consecutive consensus Ser-Gly sequences for heparan sulfate chain attachment and may also contain Ser-Gly sequences near the plasma membrane that serve as attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate side chains. The length of the ectodomains varies markedly among family members, whereas the length of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain is highly conserved (5Horowitz A. Simons M. J. Biol.

Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). So far the site of cleavage has not been identified. For syndecan-1, a cleavage site has been localized within nine amino acids adjacent to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane (13Fitzgerald M.L. Wang Z. Park P.W. Murphy G. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 811-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar).

For this purpose, recombinant fusion proteins were constructed that contained the ectodomain of syndecan-1 or -4 with reporter proteins attached to the N and C terminus via linker oligopeptides.The pathophysiological relevance of our findings for the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis lays in the fact that syndecans are constitutively expressed by endothelial cells of the vascular system and that plasmin and thrombin are involved in thrombogenic and thrombolytic processes at the site of arteriosclerotic lesions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sodium [35S]sulfate (carrier free, 0.8–1.5 TBq mg–1 sulfur) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals GmbH (Eschwege, Germany). Heparan sulfate lyase (heparitinase, EC 4.2.2.8) and chondroitin sulfate lyase (chondroitinase ABC, EC 4.2.2.4) were from Medac (Hamburg, Germany). Plasmin (human plasma fibrinolysin, EC 3.4.21.7) 5.7 units/mg protein and thrombin (human plasma, factor IIa, EC 3.4.21.5) 2800 NIH units/mg protein were from Sigma. Monoclonal mouse anti-syndecan-1 (DL101), anti-syndecan-4 (5G9), polyclonal rabbit anti-syndecan-1 (H174), and anti-syndecan-4 (H140) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, polyclonal goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgG (P-0447) from DakoCytomation, and polyclonal goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG from Vector Laboratories. All other chemicals were of analytical grade or the best grade available.Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were harvested from fresh human umbilical cords as previously described (15Levi E. Fridman R. Miao H.Q. Ma Y.S. Yayon A. Vlodavsky I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7069-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Primary isolated cells were cultured in gelatin-precoated tissue flasks at 37 °C under 5% CO2/95% air. Culture medium consisted of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and supplements, as previously described (17Schmidt A. Goepfert C. Feitsma K. Buddecke E. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), including 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin (Bayer, Wuppertal, Germany). Cultures of the second to the fifth passage were used for the experiments.Immunoassays—Cell surface-exposed syndecan ectodomains were identified according to a protocol described previously (17Schmidt A. Goepfert C. Feitsma K. Buddecke E. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 164: 57-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for cell adhesion molecules. Native cells were exposed to monoclonal anti-syndecan-1 or -4 antibodies (1:200), which recognize the glycosylated form of syndecans. Plates were finally incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000). Sandwich immunoassays were designed for detection of the shed syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains according to Rioux et al. (18Rioux V. Landry R.Y. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 167-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that mouse monoclonal antibodies were employed as capture, polyclonal rabbit anti-syndecans as secondary antibodies, and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50,000) reserved for color development. The serum-free cell supernatant containing the shed ectodomains of syndecan-1 and -4 was freeze-dried, redissolved in a small volume, dialyzed, and deglycosylated by heparitinase and chondroitin sulfate lyase for an enhanced binding of antibodies. For Western blot analysis, syndecan-1 and -4 were collected from the cell supernatant by protein A-Sepharose precoated with both polyclonal anti-syndecan-1 and anti-syndecan-4 antibodies that recognize the glycosylated form of syndecans. Thereafter, the protein A-Sepharose suspension was degraded by heparitinase and chondroitin sulfate lyase, boiled in SDS buffer, and submitted to PAGE. The blotted deglycosylated syndecans were detected according to a standard protocol using monoclonal anti-syndecan-1 or anti-syndecan-4 antibodies.Construction of Syndecan-1 and Syndecan-4 Ectodomain Fusion Proteins—The pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) was used to express and purify fusion proteins produced from the cloned ectodomain of syndecan-1 and -4 with the 5′linker to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) DNA and 3′linker to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) DNA. The coding sequences of the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains were amplified by PCR from normal human fibroblast cDNA using primers containing a 5′EcoRI and a 3′XbaI site (syndecan-1) or a 5′EcoRI and 3′KpnI site (syndecan-4). The sequence coding for EYFP was amplified from the plasmid pIRES-EYFP (BD Biosciences/Clontech) using primers containing a 5′XbaI and 3′HindIII site. The syndecan-1 and EYFP PCR products were digested with XbaI, ligated, and digested again with EcoRI and HindIII. The purified Syn-1-EYFP product was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the pMal-c2 expression vector downstream of the MalE gene coding for MBP. For construction of the syndecan-4 fusion protein, a different cloning protocol was used. First, the EYFP PCR product was digested with XbaI and HindIII and ligated into the respective sites of pUC19 vector (Invitrogen), which was designated as pUC19-EYFP. Second, the syndecan-4 PCR fragment was cloned via the EcoRI and KpnI sites upstream of EYFP into the pUC19-EYFP vector. Third, after digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, the syndecan-4-EYFP construct was cloned downstream of MPB into the respective sites of the pMAL-c2 expression vector. After sequence verification, the plasmids for MBP-Syn-1-EYFP and MBP-Syn-4-EYFP fusion products were transfected into Escherichia coli BL21 plysS cells. Overexpression and purification of the MBP fusion proteins were performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, E. coli BL21 plysS cells were grown until A600 reached a value of 0.7. Thereafter, expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.3 mm) for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in column buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and sonicated. Cell extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant was bound to a 5-ml amylose resin column. After extensive washing with column buffer, the fusion proteins were eluted from the column with column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. The elution fractions were examined on SDS-PAGE to check for their purity. Fractions containing recombinant MBP-Syn-1-EYFP or MBP-Syn-4-EYFP protein were pooled and used for further digestions with plasmin or thrombin.Shedding of Cell Membrane-integrated/associated Sulfated Proteoglycans—50,000 human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded in 35 mm diameter plastic dishes, cultured to confluence, and labeled with 370 kBq (10 μCi) of [35S]sulfate/ml medium for 48 h. Thereafter, the cultures were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were incubated in 1 ml of chase medium (serum-free medium, Invitrogen) containing 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μg of ciprofloxacin/ml in HEPES at 20 mm in the absence or presence of 15 milliunits of plasmin or 15 units of thrombin for 3–6 h. In pilot experiments, the concentration of plasmin and thrombin was adjusted to maximum activity in our system. At the end of the experiment, the cell-free medium and 1 ml of washing solution (phosphate-buffered saline) were pooled (chase medium) and stored at 4 °C until use. The pericellular compartment was obtained by trypsinization of the cells and centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min (trypsin pool). The chase medium and trypsin pool were used for further analysis. Reference values for the cell number/dish were obtained from parallel cultures. The chase medium and trypsin pool were used in direct route or after digestion with chondroitinase ABC for 4 h at 37 °C, lyophylized, and submitted to a size exclusion chromatography on calibrated 25-ml Sephadex G-50 medium columns equilibrated in 1 m NaCl. The 35S-labeled radioactivity of the V0 fraction represents the total amount of total 35S-labeled proteoglycans or after chondroitinase ABC degradation the [35S]heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans. The chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans are calculated as the difference of the total and heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans.Electrophoresis and Microsequence Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions using a 12% polyacrylamide separating gel and a 3.5% stacking gel. The ectodomains were treated (4 h, 37 °C) with plasmin or thrombin at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:5 (w/w) in a total volume of 50 μl. The digest was diluted with concentrated sample buffer to the standard SDS concentration used for electrophoresis, boiled for 5 min, separated by electrophoresis (MiniProtean II, Bio-Rad), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the resolved fusion protein fragments were stained with Ponceau red. Bands indicated in Fig. 4, B and C, were cut and subjected to N-terminal sequencing (10 cycles) on an Applied Biosystems 492 gas-phase protein sequencer.RESULTSExpression of Syndecan-1 and -4 on Transcriptional and Translational Levels—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells express syndecan-1, -2, -3 and -4 in cell culture at the cell surface. Fig. 1A shows the cDNA transcripts of the corresponding mRNA. The exposure of syndecan to the cell surface was evidenced by immunoassays (see “Experimental Procedures”) using monoclonal antibodies directed against the ectodomains of syndecan-1 and -4. The values given in Fig. 1B depended on the different affinities of the antibodies and did not reflect differences of concentration. For detection of the shed ectodomain, sandwich immunoassays for syndecan-1 and -4 were designed. Because quantified standards were not available, the values are given in arbitrary units normalized for cell number. Western blot analysis demonstrates the deglycosylated protein core of syndecan-1 and -4. Fig. 1C shows bands in the order of 25–35 kDa, but a correct molecular size could not be predicted, because the cleaving sites of the ectodomain generated under cell culture conditions were not known.FIGURE 1Evidence of syndecans on transcriptional and translational level. A, total RNA was isolated from confluent cultures (HUVEC). 2 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA and submitted to PCR using syndecan-specific forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers. PCR products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The bands are representative for five experiments. B, exposure of syndecan-1 and -4 to the cell surface. Confluent HUVEC cultures were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-syndecan-1 or -4 antibodies and with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Syndecans shed into the cell supernatant were detected by sandwich immunoassays designed for syndecan-1 and -4 (see”Experimental Procedures“). Because quantified standards were not available, values are expressed in arbitrary units normalized for cell number. C, Western blot analysis of deglycosylated shed syndecans. Syndecans of the cell supernatant were collected by binding to protein A-Sepharose precoated with a combination of polyclonal rabbit anti-syndecan-1 and -4 antibodies, degraded with heparitinase, and chondroitin lyase and submitted to PAGE.

The kinetics of the constitutive and protease-accelerated shedding is shown in Fig. 2A. After a hyperbolic increase of 35S-labeled material, a nearly constant level was reached after 3–6 h. The constitutive shedding is accelerated in the presence of plasmin or thrombin 1.5-fold over the control values (p < 0.05). The 35S-labeled material that was shed into the medium included the 35S-labeled heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate bearing ectodomain of syndecans but also chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate-containing proteoglycans exported by HUVEC under physiological conditions. The shedding process could be followed also by examination of the cell membrane-integrated/associated 35S-labeled material after releasing it from the cell surface by trypsin treatment (Fig. 2B). In the control cells (constitutive shedding), the zero time value 5490 cpm/105 cells (100%) decreased within 6 h to 3304 cpm/105 cells (60.1%). In the presence of thrombin, a decrease to 40%, and of plasmin, to 33.8% was found (p < 0.05). No significant difference between the effect of plasmin and thrombin could be observed.FIGURE 2Shedding kinetics of cell membrane-integrated/associated 35S-labeled proteoglycans. Confluent endothelial cells prelabeled with inorganic [35S]sulfate were washed exhaustively and incubated in serum-free medium at 37 °C in the presence or absence of plasmin or thrombin.

In addition, syndecan-1 and -3 possess two and syndecan-4, one, membrane-proximal attachment sites for chondroitin sulfate. To evaluate the heparan sulfate-specific shedding in further experiments, the 35S-labeled chondroitin sulfate chains of syndecan and other chondroitin and dermatan sulfates containing proteoglycans were eliminated by exhaustive degradation of the shed 35S-labeled material with chondroitin sulfate lyase (EC 4.2.2.4). Fig. 3A shows that >50% of the total proteoglycans that were shed into the medium accounts for heparan sulfate in plasmin- or thrombin-treated cells, suggesting that the protease-accelerated shedding involves the membrane-integrated syndecans. The cell-associated 35S-labeled radioactivity obtained by and quantified after trypsin treatment of the cells is shown in Fig. 3B. The shedding activity of the plasmin and thrombin can be completely inhibited by 4-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride (not shown).FIGURE 3Accelerated shedding of 35S-labeled heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

This system contained substrate (fusion protein) and enzyme (plasmin, thrombin) as the only reactants excluding the cellular shedding activities. As the cleavage site was suggested to be proximal to the C terminus of the ectodomains, split products with free N termini were expected to be in the order of oligopeptides containing a few amino acids only. For better detection of split products, the syndecan ectodomains were linked with EYFP at the C terminus by a decapeptide linker. The N terminus of the ectodomain was tagged via an octapeptide linker with MBP to facilitate purification of the fusion protein.Plasmin Cleaves the Syndecan-4 Fusion Protein at the Lys114–Arg115 and at the Lys129–Val130 Bonds—SDS-PAGE of the affinity-purified fusion protein revealed, besides the expected MBP-Syn-4 ectodomain-EYFP (predicted molecular mass 92.5 kDa), fragments with lower molecular mass obviously because of a truncated synthesis. A control blot of the native syndecan-4 fusion protein is shown in Fig. 4A and gave a similar band pattern for syndecan-1 fusion protein (not shown). The fusion protein of the syndecan-4 ectodomain was used as the substrate for plasmin. The proteolytic split products obtained after plasmin treatment were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and bands I–VI were excised and analyzed by gas-phase protein sequencing. Fig. 4B shows the band pattern of the syndecan-4 fusion protein obtained after incubation with plasmin. Bands I–III showed the sequence MKTEEGKLVI corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of MBP; band IV gave ambiguous values. Bands V and VI revealed the N-terminal sequences RISPYEESE (band V) and VSMSSTVQG (band VI). These sequences indicate cleavage sites between Lys114 and Arg115 and between Lys129 and Val130 of the ectodomain of syndecan-4 localized at a distance from the cell membrane of 33 and 17 amino acids.Thrombin cleaves the syndecan-4 fusion protein at the Lys114–Arg115 bond and the bond between the C-terminal linker oligopeptide and EYFP. The degradation pattern of the syndecan-4 ectodomain fusion protein after degradation with thrombin is shown in Fig. 4C. Bands I–III had the same N-terminal sequence (MKTEEGKLVI) as the corresponding bands obtained by plasmin treatment. Sequence analysis of band V gave an identical sequence as the corresponding plasmin-generated band (RISPVEESE). Thus, plasmin and thrombin recognize the same sequence (Lys-Arg) and deliver identical split products. The linker oligopeptide connecting the ectodomain and EYFP that had the C-terminal sequence RGAG served as a control for the proteolytic activity and specificity of thrombin. Thrombin is known to cleave the Arg–Gly bond of fibrinogen, thereby converting fibrinogen to fibrin monomers. Thus, the second split product after thrombin treatment (band VI) gave the expected sequence GAGMVSKGEE, containing the start sequence of EYFP (MVSKGEE) with the last three amino acids of the decapeptide linker at the N terminus. Fig. 5 shows the amino acid sequence of the complete fusion protein of syndecan-4 and the position of the identified cleavage sites. The sequences cleaved in the syndecan-4 ectodomain are not present in syndecan-1, and therefore neither plasminnor thrombin-catalyzed cleavage of the ectodomain could be observed. However, plasmin-specific cleavage sites were found to exist in MBP (K↓V, K↓R) and EYFP (K↓R) of the fusion proteins. The corresponding split products of MBP were not found within the analyzed"

This up-regulation has been proposed to play a role in nicotine addiction and withdrawal. The regulatory mechanisms behind nicotine-induced up-regulation of surface nicotinic acetylcholine receptors remain to be determined. It has recently been suggested that nicotine stimulation acts through increased assembly and maturation of receptor subunits into functional pentameric receptors. Studies of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors suggest that the availability of unassembled subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum can be regulated by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, resulting in altered surface expression. Here, we describe a role for ubiquilin-1, a ubiquitin-like protein with the capacity to interact with both the proteosome and ubiquitin ligases, in regulating nicotine-induced up-regulation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Ubiquilin-1 interacts with unassembled α3 and α4 subunits when coexpressed in heterologous cells and interacts with endogenous nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in neurons. Coexpression of ubiquilin-1 and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in heterologous cells dramatically reduces the expression of the receptors on the cell surface. In cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons, expression of ubiquilin-1 abolishes nicotine-induced up-regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but has no effect on the basal level of surface receptors. Coimmunostaining shows that the interaction of ubiquilin-1 with the α3 subunit draws the receptor subunit and proteosome into a complex. These data suggest that ubiquilin-1 limits the availability of unassembled nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits in neurons by drawing them to the proteosome, thus regulating nicotine-induced up-regulation.

The abundance and activity of ligand-gated ion channels at neuronal membranes are dynamically regulated by extracellular stimuli, and this regulation plays a key role in modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (1Malinow R.

This up-regulation is thought to play an important role in nicotine dependence, and the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal may be linked to both the recovery of desensitized receptors and the increased number of surface receptors (13Dani J.A.

Neuronal nAChRs consist of subunits encoded by twelve different genes (α2-10 and β2-4), and their assembly in proper combinations into functional pentameric channels is necessary prior to trafficking to the surface membrane (15Wang F.

Immunostaining shows that α3, α5, β2, and β4 subunits are localized at mouse superior cervical ganglion (SCG) synapses (23Feng G. Steinbach J.H. Sanes J.R. J.

Thus, nAChRs expressed in rodent SCG contain the α3 subunit along with β2, β4, or both and, in some cases, the α5 subunit (22McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev.

Consistent with these data, mice lacking the α3 subunit or lacking both the β2 and β4 subunits show marked autonomic dysfunction and die shortly after birth (26Xu W. Orr-Urtreger A. Nigro F.

Previous studies have shown that mRNA levels of nAChR subunits do not change after nicotine treatment (10Marks M.J. Pauly J.R. Gross S.D. Deneris E.S. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Heinemann S.F. Collins A.C.

Studies using heterologous cells, in which nicotine-induced up-regulation of nAChRs occurs in a fashion similar to that in neurons, have suggested several potential mechanisms underlying this up-regulation. Nicotine has been shown to affect a range of cellular mechanisms such as decreased turnover rates of nAChRs (4Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar), increased assembly (4Peng X. Gerzanich V. Anand R. Whiting P.J. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wang F.

Recent studies suggest that the regulation of subunit assembly and maturation play an important role in nicotine-induced up-regulation. Studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer to measure the assembly of nAChRs showed that nicotine stimulation results in increased assembly of α4β2 nAChRs in somatic compartments (36Nashmi R. Dickinson M.E. McKinney S. Jareb M. Labarca C. Fraser S.E. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11554-11567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nicotine treatment has been shown to promote the assembly of pentameric channels and maturation through the secretory pathway (37Sallette J. Pons S. Devillers-Thiery A. Soudant M. Prado de Carvalho L. Changeux J.P. Corringer P.J. Neuron. 2005; 46: 595-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, a recent study also showed that interfering with receptor internalization, post-endocytic trafficking, and lysosomal degradation does not affect nicotine-induced up-regulation of surface receptors but that exocytic trafficking is required (6Darsow T. Booker T.K. Pina-Crespo J.C. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18311-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Studies of muscle nAChRs further suggest that the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway plays a role in regulating surface expression of nAChRs by modulating the availability of an intracellular pool of assembly-competent nAChR subunits for assembly and subsequent trafficking (38Christianson J.C. Green W.N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a model for nicotine-induced up-regulation of nAChRs based on the regulation of receptor subunit availability for assembly/maturation and exocytic trafficking. Currently, regulatory molecules influencing the assembly and subsequent trafficking of neuronal nAChRs to the surface membrane remain to be identified. Here we report the identification of ubiquilin-1 as a regulator of nAChR trafficking/assembly. Ubiquilin-1 (also known as Plic-1 (protein linking integrin-associated protein with cytoskeleton 1)) is a ubiquitin-like protein with the capacity to interact with both the proteosome and ubiquitin ligases (39Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 40Kleijnen M.F. Alarcon R.M. Howley P.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We found that ubiquilin-1 directly interacts with unassembled α3 and α4 subunits. Immunostaining shows that ubiquilin-1 draws the α3 nAChR subunit to distinct puncta colocalizing with proteosomal subunits. Expression of ubiquilin-1 in an α3β2 receptor-expressing stable cell line leads to down-regulation of surface receptors. In cultured SCG neurons, ubiquilin-1 prevents the up-regulation of nAChRs induced by nicotine. These data suggest a role for ubiquilin-1 in regulating the assembly/trafficking of neuronal nAChRs. SCG cDNA Library—mRNA from mouse SCGs were isolated as previously described (41Feng G. Deak P. Kasbekar D.P. Gil D.W. Hall L.M. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries were constructed using the HybriZAP 2.1 vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized with either oligo(dT) primers or random primers. Oligo(dT) and random primed cDNAs were cloned directionally into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the HybriZAP 2.1 vector. Phagemid libraries with a primary titer of 6 × 106 (oligo(dT)-primed) and 4.8 × 106 (random primed) were obtained. The average insert sizes were 1.9 and 1.4 kb for oligo(dT) and random primed libraries, respectively. The libraries were amplified once and kept at 4 °C. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The large cytoplasmic loop of the α3 nAChR subunit was cloned into the pGBKT7 plasmid (Clontech) and transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 reporter strain using a modified lithium-acetate protocol (42Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 777-785PubMed Google Scholar). The bait-bearing strain was subsequently cotransformed with the random primed SCG cDNA library. Selection for His3 reporter gene activation was performed on selection agar plates without histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, and colonies appearing after 4-5 days at 30 °C were restreaked on plates that also lacked adenine. Library plasmids were recovered from Ade2 reporter gene-positive clones following the Matchmaker 3 protocol (Clontech), and their inserts were sequenced. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. COS7 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin. For transfection, the cells were plated in 6-well plates without antibiotics and grown until 50-80% confluent. The cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after transfection, the cells were fixed or harvested for further immunohistochemical or biochemical analysis. Lentiviral Constructs—HA-tagged ubiquilin-1 was cloned into the FUGW vector (43Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar), and this construct was transfected into HEK293T cells along with the Δ8.9 HIV-1 packaging vector and VSVG using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, media from the transfected plates were collected, and cell debris was spun down. The culture medium containing viruses was kept at -80 °C until it was thawed for infection. Antibodies—The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the α3, α7, and β2 subunits were generated and affinity-purified in the laboratory using fusion proteins from a unique region of the large cytoplasmic loop of each subunit (24Parker M.J. Zhao S. Bredt D.S. Sanes J.R. Feng G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The rat monoclonal antibodies Mab299, Mab270, and Mab210 were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (44Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody to human ubiquilin-2 was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School) (39Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody to the 20 S proteosome subunit α7 (HC8) was obtained from Biomol International (Plymouth Meetings, PA). Coimmunoprecipitations—For coimmunoprecipitations from heterologous cells, HA-tagged ubiquilin-1 was expressed in HEK293T cells along with the respective nAChR subunits. Transfected cells were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing PBS, Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Triton. The lysate was incubated at 4 °C with rocking for 30 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and immunoprecipitation was performed using subunit-specific antibodies. Western blotting was performed using the HA.11 monoclonal antibody (Covance). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments in cultured SCG neurons, infection with a lentivirus expressing HA-tagged ubiquilin-1 was performed after 2 days in culture. Lentiviral expression was allowed to proceed for 5 days, and neurons were then harvested in ice-cold PBS/Triton lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the anti-α3 rabbit polyclonal antibody, and subsequent Western blotting was performed using HA.11. For coimmunoprecipitation from brain tissue, 1.2 mg of mouse brain was collected in ice-cold PBS with Complete protease inhibitors and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (50 strokes). The homogenate was spun at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, incubated with 1% Triton for 1 h at 4°C, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Aliquots representing 0.2 mg of homogenized tissue were used for each condition. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an antibody against human ubiquilin-2 (39Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 409-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and subsequent Western blotting was performed with Mab299 recognizing the α4 nAChR subunit. Control immunoprecipitation was performed using rat IgG. Immunohistochemistry—COS7 cells were transfected with the α3 nAChR subunit, HA-tagged ubiquilin-1, and/or green fluorescent protein. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and washed three times in PBS. Coverslips were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.2% Triton in PBS for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution minus Triton overnight. The coverslips were then washed four times for 5 min in PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies for 2 h, washed again, and mounted in 90% glycerol with 0.1% p-phenylenediamine for imaging. For experiments in the HEK293 stable line, the cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquilin-1 or HA-tagged ubiquilin-1 missing the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain. The coverslips were washed and fixed as described above, but blocking occurred in the absence of permeabilization with 0.2% Triton. Surface staining of surface α3 nAChR subunits was performed using Mab210. The cells were then washed four times for 5 min with PBS prior to permeabilization for staining with an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) and subsequent secondary antibody immunostaining. For surface staining of cultured SCG neurons, the coverslips were incubated with Mab270 in culture media for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed three times for 5 min in PBS at 37 °C prior to being fixed for further secondary antibody immunostaining as described above. Immunostaining quantification was performed using data analysis software (NIH Image J) to determine fluorescence intensity/pixel. Student's t test was used to determine statistical significance. HEK293 Stable Cell Line—We have shown previously that the Mab210 antibody, which recognizes an extracellular epitope of the human α3 nAChR subunit (44Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), does not recognize the α3 nAChR subunit from rodents because of differences in two amino acids in the major immunogenic region (23Feng G. Steinbach J.H. Sanes J.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To be able to stain surface α3 nAChRs using the Mab210 antibody, we changed these two amino acid residues to match those in the human α3 subunit. cDNAs encoding for the rat α3 (modified) and β2 nAChR subunits were cloned into the pBUD vector, which allows for coexpression of both subunits using a dual promoter system (Invitrogen). To obtain stably transfected lines, the construct was transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. After 2 days, the cells were switched to selection medium containing 250 μg/ml of Zeocin. The surviving clones were allowed to grow for 10-14 days prior to picking and expanding. Stable cell lines were subsequently maintained in Zeocin-containing media. SCG Neuron Culture—SCGs were dissected from deeply anesthetized P2-P4 mouse pups. Ganglia were digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington) in L15 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Ganglia were spun down and collagenase removed and replaced with 1 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) for digestion for 30 min at 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was stopped using 2 ml of culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Harlan) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin). Digested SCGs were triturated up and down ∼50 times using a polished pasteur pipette to dissociate the neurons for plating. The desired dilution of neurons was transferred to 60-mm dishes or 6-well plates containing culture medium. The next day fluorodeoxyuridine and uridine (Sigma) were added to concentrations of 20 μm each to the culture medium to limit the growth of dividing cells such as fibroblasts. Biotinylation Experiments—After 2 days in culture, SCG neurons in 60-mm plates were infected with lentiviral constructs expressing HA-tagged ubiquilin-1. Lentiviral expression was allowed to proceed for 4 days, and neurons were then stimulated for 16 h with 50 μm nicotine diluted in culture media. Neurons were washed three times with progressively colder PBS++ (containing calcium and magnesium) and placed on ice. Each 60-mm plate of neurons was incubated with 14 mg of NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce), a membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent, dissolved in 4 ml of PBS++ for 40 min on ice. The biotinylation reaction was then quenched with 10 mm glycine in PBS++ followed by two more 5-min washes with ice-cold 10 mm glycine. The neurons were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer containing PBS, Complete protease inhibitors, 1% Triton, and 0.5% deoxycholate. Biotinylated proteins were pulled down using neutravidin beads (Pierce). Subsequent Western blotting for the α3 subunit and transferrin receptor was performed on biotinylated and total lysate samples. Quantification of protein bands was performed using data analysis software (NIH Image J), and levels of the α3 nAChR subunits were normalized to transferrin receptor levels.

Identification of Ubiquilin-1 as an α3 nAChR Subunit-interacting Protein—To better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating the assembly, trafficking, and targeting of neuronal nAChRs to the surface membrane, we chose the accessible mouse SCG as our model system. All SCG neurons receive cholinergic inputs and express neuronal nAChRs, thus providing a pure population of neurons for biochemical and molecular studies. Studies in chick ciliary ganglia indicate that the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains III and IV of the α3 subunit is both necessary and sufficient to target neuronal nAChRs to the postsynaptic membrane (45Williams B.M. Temburni M.K. Levey M.S. Bertrand S. Bertrand D. Jacob M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that potentially regulate the trafficking and targeting of neuronal nAChRs, we therefore performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the large cytoplasmic loop of the α3 subunit as the bait (Fig. 1A). To facilitate the identification of proteins interacting with neuronal nAChRs, we constructed yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries from mouse SCG. These SCG libraries have a significant advantage over brain libraries for the isolation of proteins interacting with the α3 nAChR subunit because the α3 subunit is not widely expressed in the central nervous system (46Yeh J.J.

Screening of the mouse SCG library with the large cytoplasmic loop of the α3 nAChR subunit resulted in the isolation of several overlapping clones partially encoding for a protein showing high sequence homology with the human ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin-1. The clones from the yeast two-hybrid screen were further used to isolate full-length clones by screening a mouse SCG cDNA library. Complete sequencing of these clones revealed that they encode the mouse ortholog of the human ubiquilin-1 gene product, and the full sequence completely matches the mouse ubiquilin-1 gene recently reported in the GenBank™ data base (accession number BC028857). The ubiquilin family of proteins (ubiquilin-1, -2, and -3) has been shown to play a role in the trafficking and degradation of a variety of proteins (39Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S.

Structurally, ubiquilins contain a ubiquitin-like (UBQ) domain at the amino terminus and a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1B); both domains have been shown to bind the proteosome complex (39Kleijnen M.F.

https://openalex.org/W2093488752,"The Lol system, comprising five Lol proteins, transfers lipoproteins from the inner to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Periplasmic LolA accepts lipoproteins from LolCDE in the inner membrane and immediately transfers them to LolB, a receptor anchored to the outer membrane. The unclosed β-barrel structures of LolA and LolB are very similar to each other and form hydrophobic cavities for lipoproteins. The lipoprotein transfer between these similar structures is unidirectional and very efficient, but requires no energy input. To reveal the mechanisms underlying this lipoprotein transfer, Arg and Phe at positions 43 and 47, respectively, of LolA were systematically mutagenized. The two residues were previously found to affect abilities to accept and transfer lipoproteins. Substitution of Phe-47 with polar residues inhibited the ability to accept lipoproteins from the inner membrane. No derivatives caused periplasmic accumulation of lipoproteins. In contrast, many Arg-43 derivatives caused unusual periplasmic accumulation of lipoproteins to various extents. However, all derivatives, except one having Leu instead of Arg, supported the growth of cells. All Arg-43 derivatives retained the ability to accept lipoproteins from the inner membrane, whereas their abilities to transfer associated lipoproteins to LolB were variously reduced. Assessment of the intensity of the hydrophobic interaction between lipoproteins and Arg-43 derivatives revealed that the LolA-lipoprotein interaction should be weak, otherwise lipoprotein transfer to LolB is inhibited, causing accumulation of lipoproteins in the periplasm."

Antibodies generated against the unique C-terminal tail of MyoXVIIIA revealed that MyoXVIIIA, MyoIIA, and SP-R210 have overlapping tissue distribution, all being highly expressed in myeloid cells, bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, and lung. Western blot analysis of COS-1 cells stably transfected with either MyoXVIIIA or MyoIIA indicated that SP-R210 antibodies recognize MyoXVIIIA. Furthermore, MyoXVIIIA but not MyoIIA localized to the surface of COS-1 cells, and most importantly, expression of MyoXVIIIA in COS-1 cells conferred SP-A binding. Western analysis of recombinant MyoXVIIIA domains expressed in bacteria mapped the epitopes of previously derived SP-R210 antibodies to the neck region of MyoXVIIIA. Antibodies raised against the neck domain of MyoXVIIIA blocked the binding of SP-A to macrophages. Together, these findings indicate that MyoXVIIIA constitutes a novel receptor for SP-A.

In the present study, we used a variety of biochemical, molecular, and cellular experiments to determine that cell-surface MyoXVIIIA is the high affinity SP-R210 receptor.

Hawgood S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8894-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Surfactant aggregate was concentrated by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and suspended in 50 ml of PBS, and 5-ml aliquots were stored frozen at –20 °C. Surfactant lipid was extracted by a dropwise addition of concentrated lavage to isobutyl alcohol (1:5 volume ratio). Delipidated protein was centrifuged at 20,000 × g, partially dried under nitrogen gas, completely dried in a lyophilizer, and then rehydrated in extraction buffer overnight (EB: 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 20 mm octyl-β-d-glucoside). Rehydrated surfactant was extracted three times by vigorous vortexing and centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min in EB. Insoluble SP-A was then dialyzed for 48 h against four changes of solubilization buffer (SB: 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.02% azide). Insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation at 50,000 × g. The supernatant was adjusted to 20 mm in CaCl2 and 1 m in NaCl by addition of 0.5 m CaCl2 and NaCl crystals to re-precipitate SP-A. SP-A was then collected at 20,000 × g for 20 min and washed three times in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm CaCl2,1 m NaCl. The precipitated SP-A was solubilized in 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and dialyzed extensively against SB to remove EDTA. The purified protein was sterilized over a Whatman 0.2-μ PES filter, and 1-mg aliquots were lyophilized and stored frozen in an anhydrous environment at –20 °C. This procedure removed contaminating IgG and albumin. Noncovalent Immobilization of SP-A—Purified SP-A (1 mg/ml) was dialyzed against MES, pH 6.5, and incubated for 2 h on ice with 0.1 volume of fresh 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin to label SP-A at its N terminus. Biotinylated SP-A was purified on PD-10-Sepharose pre-equilibrated in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Biotinylated SP-A (0.5 mg/ml) was then added to 1.5 ml of packed streptavidin-agarose beads equilibrated in a modified detergent extraction buffer containing CHAPS (50Zhu Q. Zelinka P. White T. Tanzer M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (DEB: 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% CHAPS, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm CaCl2). Biotinylated SP-A and streptavidin beads were rotated for 2 h at 4°C and then washed with DEB to remove unbound SP-A. Approximately 75% of biotinylated SP-A bound to the streptavidin-agarose beads under these conditions. Cell Culture—All cell lines were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained in a humidified tissue culture incubator under an atmosphere of 95% air, 10% CO2 for DMEM grown cells and 5% CO2 for RPMI grown cells. Isolation of SP-R210—Rat SP-R210 was obtained by detergent and salt extraction of rat lung membranes as described previously (44Chroneos Z.C. Abdolrasulnia R. Whitsett J.A. Rice W.R. Shepherd V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16375-16383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mouse SP-R210 was isolated from murine alveolar monocytes (mAM) (51Shibata Y. Berclaz P.Y. Chroneos Z.C. Yoshida M. Whitsett J.A. Trapnell B.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Frozen stocks of mAM cells were seeded in 10 150-mm2 tissue culture flasks and cultured to confluence. Confluent adherent cells were lifted in DMEM containing 0.05% trypsin and 5 mm EDTA, and cells were reseeded into 10 roller bottles containing 200 ml of DMEM. The cells were cultured 4 days in a humidified roller bottle incubator to a density of 300 million cells per flask. The cells in each flask were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in 20 ml of DEB buffer containing a protease inhibitor mix (44Chroneos Z.C. Abdolrasulnia R. Whitsett J.A. Rice W.R. Shepherd V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16375-16383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Post-nuclear supernatants were obtained at 600 × g and allowed to stand overnight. Insoluble protein aggregates were then removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Clarified supernatants were concentrated 10-fold over 30,000 Mr cut-off Centricon-Plus filtration units. The concentrated extracts were pooled and pre-adsorbed with 10 ml of streptavidin-agarose beads. Pre-adsorbed extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 25,000 × g and rotated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated SP-A·streptavidin-agarose beads. Bound proteins were washed in a 1 × 5-cm glass column with 25 ml each of DEB buffer and then with detergent free-DEB buffer. SP-A-bound proteins were eluted in 0.15-ml fractions using DEB containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were visualized on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and SP-R210 was monitored on Western blots using SP-R210 antibodies (44Chroneos Z.C. Abdolrasulnia R. Whitsett J.A. Rice W.R. Shepherd V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16375-16383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation to a final volume of 20 μl over a 100,000 Mr cut-off Microcon-100 filtration unit. Mass Spectrometry—The rat membrane SP-R210 was separated by SDS-PAGE as described previously and visualized using colloidal blue (Bio-Rad). The SP-R210 band was excised and in-gel digested with trypsin, and iodoacetamide-treated peptides were extracted according to a standard procedure (52Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Andrew J.L. 2-D Proteome Analysis Protocols. 112. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 487-512Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectra were obtained on a MALDI-TOF SPEC SE mass spectrometer in reflectron mode (Waters, Milford, MA). Peptides were searched against Swiss-Prot and TREMBL data bases using the Peptident tool (53Wilkins M.R. Williams K.L. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 186: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The search was restricted to mammalian or rodent species for proteins between 160 and 240 kDa and pI 5–7. The pI restriction was based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results indicating a heterogeneous SP-R210 band within the 5–7 pI range. The mass tolerance was set at ±0.1–0.5 Da. For peptide sequence analysis, mAM SP-R210 was isolated as described above, fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a Tris acetate gel (3–8%), and visualized by silver staining according to the procedure of Sanchez et al. (54Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D. Rabilloud T. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 221-225PubMed Google Scholar). The silver-stained SP-R210 band was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed by nanoflow HPLC interfaced to electrospray ionization on a quadrupole ion mass spectrometer (LCQ) (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) (55Shabanowitz J. Settlage R.E.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 163-177Google Scholar). MS/MS spectra were searched against a nonredundant protein data base using SEQUEST (56Yates J.R. II I Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 3202-3210Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Sequence assignments were verified by manual interpretation of the corresponding MS/MS spectra. Primary Structure Analysis—Domain identification was accomplished using Pfam (57Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D138-D141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transmembrane segments were evaluated using TMbase (58Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar). Short sequence motifs were determined using the eukaryotic linear motif resource (59Puntervoll P. Linding R. Gemund C. Chabanis-Davidson S. Mattingsdal M. Cameron S. Martin D.M. Ausiello G. Brannetti B. Costantini A. Ferre F. Maselli V. Via A. Cesareni G. Diella F. Superti-Furga G. Wyrwicz L. Ramu C. McGuigan C. Gudavalli R. Letunic I. Bork P.

Sequence alignment was performed using MacVector software. Expression of MyoXVIIIA and MyoIIA in COS-1 Cells—A blunt-end BsaAI cDNA fragment of human MyoXVIIIA from KIAA0216 cDNA clone hs04661 was inserted into the EcoRV site of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. This cDNA fragment encompasses the predicted open reading frame with flanking 68 and 250 bp of 5′- and 3′-UTR. The protein encoded by this cDNA is designated as MyoXVIIIAβ/SP-R210S (see “Results”). Expression plasmids containing MyoXVIIIAβ/SP-R210S in the sense or antisense orientations were produced in Escherichia coli, purified by standard procedures, and transfected into COS-1 cells using GeneJuice. Stable transfectants with plasmid in the sense orientation (MyoXVIIIAβ/SP-R210S-COS-1 cells) or antisense orientation (control-COS-1 cells) were selected in the presence of 300 μg/ml neomycin. The entire 7.5-kb MyoIIA cDNA was subcloned into the NotI restriction site of the pcDNA3.1 vector. Polyclonal Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies against gel-purified rat SP-R210 were described previously (44Chroneos Z.C. Abdolrasulnia R. Whitsett J.A. Rice W.R. Shepherd V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16375-16383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains (MyoXVIIIAct) and the neck (MyoXVIIIAn) domains of MyoXVIIIA were expressed in bacteria (60Szeliga J. Jordan J. Yang C.-H. Sever-Chroneos Z. Chroneos Z.C. Anal. Biochem. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), and polyclonal antibodies were generated commercially in rabbits (CoCalico Biological Laboratories, Reamstown, PA) by a standard protocol using TiterMax (Sigma) as primary adjuvant. Antigen boost was in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The MyoXVIIIAct antigen was supplied as a lyophilized powder. Immuno-affinity-purified MyoXVIIIAct antibody was obtained by affinity chromatography using recombinant MyoXVIIIAct covalently attached to NHS-activated Sepharose. The MyoXVIIIAn antigen was rendered insoluble by dialysis in PBS and supplied as a lyophilized powder. Total polyclonal IgG was purified by affinity chromatography on a HiTrap protein G-Sepharose column. Northern Blot Hybridization—Total RNA from indicated tissues and cells was isolated using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's directions. For Northern hybridization, 10 μg of total RNA was separated using 1.2% agarose denaturing gels. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in ExpressHyb buffer and hybridized in the same buffer with indicated 32P-labeled cDNA probes for 1 h at 65°C. Membranes were washed three times for 30 min each in 3, 2, and 1× SSC in the presence of 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein was isolated from the indicated tissues using Trizol reagent after the isolation of total RNA according to the manufacturer's directions. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay and BSA as standard. Protein was used immediately after isolation. Proteins, 20–40 μg, were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed first with indicated primary and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation—mAM ce"

Five positive regulatory regions together control lineage-restricted and activation-dependent IL-2Rα induction in response to antigen and IL-2. We now show that TGF-β cooperates with T cell receptor (TCR) signaling to increase IL-2Rα gene expression.

Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1937-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 48Gray J.D. Hirokawa M. Ohtsuka K. Horwitz D.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2248-2254PubMed Google Scholar). We now show that IL-2Rα expression is increased following exposure to TGF-β1. Moreover, we describe a novel positive regulatory region (PRRV) in the IL-2Rα gene that contains binding sites for Smad, AP-1, and CREB/ATF proteins, which mediate PRRV function in response to costimulation via the T cell receptor and TGF-β1. The discovery of PRRV clarifies the basis for TGF-β-mediated IL-2Rα regulation, providing a mechanism by which TGF-β1 can affect IL-2 signaling. Given the importance of IL-2 signaling for the development of regulatory T cells (4Malek T.R. Yu A. Vincek V. Scibelli P. Kong L. Immunity. 2002; 17: 167-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), our data suggest a mechanism by which TCR and TGF-β1 augment the development of these cells. Mice and Cell Culture—C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Smad3-/- mice (C57BL/6xSv129) were generated by targeted gene disruption in murine embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination (42Yang X. Letterio J.J. Lechleider R.J. Chen L. Hayman R. Gu H. Roberts A.B. Deng C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Smad4 gene was disrupted in T cells of mice by crossing the Smad4-floxed mice (49Yang X. Li C. Herrera P.L. Deng C.X. Genesis. 2002; 32: 80-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) with p56lck-Cre (Lck-Cre) transgenic mice. The mice used in these experiments were 8–10 weeks of age. All of the experiments were performed under protocols approved by the National Institutes of Health Animal Use and Care Committee and followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines “Using Animals in Intramural Research.” Single-cell suspensions from spleen were prepared, and these splenocytes (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated for 24 h in plates coated with 2 μg/ml each of anti-CD3ϵ and soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) in the absence or presence of 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Splenocytes were stained with phycoerythrin-labeled CD4, allophycocyanin-labeled CD8, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD25 (all from PharMingen) and analyzed using a FACSort with CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). EL4 and PC60 cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were made using the Omniscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real time PCR was performed on a 7900H sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the primers and Taqman probes were as follows: murine IL-2Rα: 5′-TACAAGAACGGCACCATCCTAA-3′, 5′-TTGCTGCTCCAGGAGTTTCC-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-TGAATGCAAGAGAGGTTTCCGAAGACTAAAGG-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′; murine 18S rRNA: 5′-CCTTTAACGAGGATCCATTGGA-3′,5′-ACGAGCTTTTTAACTGCAGCAA-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-CGCGGTAATTCCAGCTCCAATAGCGTATATT-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′. Plasmid Constructs—To generate the WT murine PRRV luciferase reporter construct, we subcloned the murine -135 to +93 IL-2Rα promoter fragment 5′ to the luciferase gene between the XhoI and HindIII sites in the polylinker of the pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The PCR fragment containing murine PRRV (-7664 to -7566) was then subcloned between the KpnI and SacI sites in the polylinker upstream of the promoter fragment. Site-directed mutagenesis of this PRRV-WT plasmid was performed using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Three mutagenic primers, mSBE (5′-GTTACTATAGTTACATACATCTTTACATAAAAGGTGACACAGACATGACTTCACCTTCC-3′), mAP1 (5′-GTTACTATAGTTACATAGACGTCTAGACAAAAGGTGACATGGACATGACTTCACCTTCC-3′), and mCREB (5′-GACACAGACATGACTTTGCCTTCCTCCCCAAAC-3′) were used, respectively, to introduce the underlined 6- or 2-bp changes into the murine PRRV. The dominant-negative Smad3 3S→A plasmid was provided by Anita Roberts, and the CMV-TAM67 plasmid encoding a dominant-negative mutant variant of c-Jun plasmid (50Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from M. J. Birrer. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—EL4 and PC60 cells were transiently transfected using DEAE-dextran (51Sompayrac L.M. Danna K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7575-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In each case, 5 × 106 cells in logarithmic growth phase were transfected with 10 μg of supercoiled test plasmid and 40 ng of pRL-SV40 as a transfection efficiency control; the cells were then allowed to recover for 24 h at 37 °C. Transfected cells were stimulated for 18 h with either medium alone or 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1 in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus 1 μg/ml of ionomycin, and the cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase activity using a luminometer (Victor2 1420 Multilabel Counter; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a dual luciferase assay system kit (Promega). Transient transfections of normal murine T cells were performed by electroporation, as previously described (22Kim H.P. Kelly J. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Restriction Endonuclease Accessibility—Restriction enzyme accessibility assays were based on a published procedure (52Liu H. Kang H. Liu R. Chen X. Zhao K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6471-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 53Guo L. Hu-Li J. Paul W.E. Immunity. 2004; 20: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with certain modifications. In brief, splenic T cells (1 × 106/ml) were stimulated for 24 h in plates coated with 2 μg/ml each of anti-CD3ϵ and soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies in the absence or presence of 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1. These cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine) to allow isolation of nuclei. The nuclei were washed once with 200 μl of nuclear buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine), resuspended in 50 μl of 1× digestion buffer (New England buffer 2), and digested with 1 μl of HaeIII (10 units) for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of stop buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS, 0.6 mg/ml of proteinase K) and incubated at 50 °C for a minimum of 4 h. Following purification by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation, the DNA (3 μg) was ligated overnight to an annealed adaptor in a reaction volume of 50 μl containing 60 pmol of adaptor and 800 units of T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). A nested PCR strategy was used to identify the sites of linker ligation. Samples were amplified for 12 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by a final 10-min extension step at 72 °C. The primers used in the first step PCR were a gene-specific primer and a common primer (T7 primer) complementary to the long strand of the linker. The reaction product (2 μl) was then used to perform an additional 45 cycles of PCR in a 9700HT Sequence Detection System. The probe and primers used in the real time PCR were a gene-specific probe, the gene-specific primer used in the first PCR reaction, and a nested common primer (nested primer), which is also complementary to the long strand of linker but 3′ of the common T7 primer. The linearity of the assay does depend upon the linearity of the first amplification step. The oligonucleotides used for the adaptor are: 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3 (long strand) and 5′-ACCTGCCCGG-3′ (short strand). The primers and probes used for the PCR are: 5′-CTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ (T7 primer); 5′-TCGAGCGGCCGCCCGGGCAGGT-3′ (nested primer); 5′-GAAGCACTAGTCTGTGGGTTTGG-3′ (PRRV primer); 5′-(6-FAM)-AAAAGGTGACACAGACATGACTTCACCTTCCT-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′ (PRRV probe); 5′-GACAGCTCAGAGTTTCCACAGTTC-3′ (PRRIV primer); 5′-(6-FAM)-CAGCAGCAGCTAACTGAAGCCACCTTTCTT-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′ (PRRIV probe); 5′-AGCCAAACGGGTCATCATCT-3′ (GAPDH primer); and 5′-(6-FAM)-TGCATCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′ (GAPDH probe). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described (22Kim H.P. Kelly J. Leonard W.J. Immunity. 2001; 15: 159-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CD4 splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice were either left unstimulated or stimulated with 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1 in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml of anti-CD3ϵ and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen) for 18 h at 37 °C, followed by cross-linking with formaldehyde. Formaldehyde-treated nuclear lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for Smad3 (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). After treatment with proteinase K to remove protein and reversal of cross-links, the amounts of selected DNA sequences were assessed by real time PCR. The sequences of the primers and Taqman probe for PRRV were 5′-CAATGATGTCAGTCGGAAAGCTA-3′, 5′-GAAGCACTAGTCTGTGGGTTTGG-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-AAAAGGTGACACAGACATGACTTCACCTTCCT-(TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′, respectively. The sequences of the primers and Taqman probe for PRRIII are 5′-AGCAAAGGCTCACCTCTAACCTAA-3′, 5′-TTGCTCAACTCTCTTATCAGAAATGTC-3′, and 5′-(6-FAM)-AGGCAATCTGGGTCAGATAGTTGATGCATGATA- (TAMRA-6-FAM)-3′, respectively. IL-2Rα Protein and mRNA Are Cooperatively Induced in Splenocytes by Costimulation via TCR and TGF-β1—Because TGF-β1 can inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation and has a range of actions in T cells, including inhibition of apoptosis and augmentation of effector cell expansion (43de Jong R. van Lier R.A. Ruscetti F.W. Schmitt C. Debre P. Mossalayi M.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44Zhang X. Giangreco L. Broome H.E. Dargan C.M. Swain S.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45Cerwenka A. Bevec D. Majdic O. Knapp W. Holter W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4367-4377PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cerwenka A. Kovar H. Majdic O. Holter W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 459-464PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect of TGF-β1 on IL-2Rα (CD25) expression. TGF-β1 had no effect by itself, but it increased IL-2Rα mRNA levels in C57BL/6 splenic T lymphocytes activated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (Fig. 1A), as well as in EL4 and PC60 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin (PI) (Fig. 1B). TGF-β1 also increased IL-2Rα protein levels in both CD4 and CD8 cells activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the IL-2Rα gene might have a TGF-β response element. Identification of a TGF-β Response Element in the IL-2Rα Gene—Previously it was demonstrated that four PRRs and a CD28 response element are essential for mitogen-induced and/or IL-2-induced activation of IL-2Rα gene expression. PRRI, PRRII, PRRIII, and PRRIV correspond to DNase I-hypersensitive sites and are conserved in the human and murine IL-2Rα genes. We thus searched for conserved noncoding sequences in the human and mouse IL-2Rα gene using the VISTA program (54Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 55Dubchak I. Brudno M. Loots G.G. Pachter L. Mayor C. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1304-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). One highly conserved region was ∼7.6 kb 5′ to the transcription initiation site in both species. Strikingly, this region contains three “AGAC” Smad2/Smad3 consensus binding elements (SBEs), as well as potential binding sites for AP-1 and CREB/ATF (Fig. 2A). Because Smad3 and Smad4 can cooperate with c-Jun/c-Fos to mediate TGF-β-induced transcription (56Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), the juxtapositioning of these sites suggested that this region might be a TGF-β response element. Fragments spanning this region were PCR-amplified, cloned 5′ to the murine IL-2Rα promoter (-135 to +93) in pGL3-Basic, and transfected into EL4 and PC60 cells, and the cells were analyzed for transcriptional activity. TGF-β1 induced ∼9.2- and 19.4-fold inducibility in EL4 and PC60 cells, respectively (Fig. 2B, top construct). Although stimulation with PI had only a modest effect in both cell types, the inducibility was increased when the cells were additionally incubated with TGF-β1. In contrast, the -2543 to +93/luciferase/+93 to +4533 construct, which lacks the putative TGF-β response element, did not respond to TGF-β1, and TGF-β1 actually lowered PI-mediated induction (Fig. 2B, middle construct), presumably because of general suppressive action of TGF-β1. Transfection of EL4 cells with a “full-length” -8888 to +93/luciferase/+93 to +4533 construct, showed only modest TGF-β1-mediated induction of promoter activity; however, TGF-β1 greatly increased the inducibility mediated by treatment with PI (Fig. 2B, bottom construct). Thus, TGF-β1 could increase PI-induced IL-2Rα promoter activity, and this effect was mediated by the PRRV TGF-β response element located ∼7.6 kb 5′ to the transcription initiation site in both humans and mice. TCR and TGF-β-induced Restriction Endonuclease Accessibility at PRRV—To determine whether PRRV exists in an open or closed chromatin conformation, a restriction endonuclease accessibility (REA) assay was used and quantitated by real time PCR. The degree to which HaeIII cut its cognate site was used as a measure of the accessibility of the PRRV and PRRIV region and was measured with a two-step nested PCR strategy (see “Materials and Methods”). A similar analysis of the GAPDH exon was used as a control. The results are expressed as a ratio of cutting at PRRV or PRRIV to cutting at GAPDH. Naive splenic T cells (106/ml) were stimulated for 24 h in plates coated with 2 μg/ml each of anti-CD3ϵ and soluble anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies in the absence or presence of 2 ng/ml of TGF-β1. An increase in REA of cells treated with αCD3 + αCD28 was observed at PRRV as well as at the PRRIV TCR response element (Fig. 3, lane 4), whereas the treatment with TGF-β had no effect on the REA at either site (Fig. 3, lane 6). TGF-β1 further increased the REA at PRRV in cells activated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (Fig. 3, lane 8), whereas there was no further increase of REA at PRRIV. These data suggested that the chromatin structure of PRRV is converted to an open conformation by both TCR stimulation and TGF-β1, facilitating IL-2Rα transcription. The Smad, AP-1, and CREB/ATF-binding Sites in PRRV Are Essential for TGF-β1-induced IL-2Rα Gene Expression—To analyze the functional significance and the relative contribution of the Smad-, AP-1-, and CREB/ATF-binding sites, we mutated each site alone and in combination in the context of the -7664 to -7566 murine IL-2Rα-luciferase reporter construct and assayed the TGF-β responsiveness of each construct (Fig. 4A). In EL4 and PC60 cells, selective mutation of the SBE (PRRVm1), AP-1 site (PRRVm2), CREB/ATF site (PRRVm4), or simultaneous mutation of both AP-1- and CREB/ATF-binding sites (PRRVm6) diminished TGF-β inducibility. Simultaneous mutation of SBE- and AP-1-binding sites (PRRVm3), of SBE- and CREB/ATF-binding sites (PRRVm5), or of all sites together (PRRVm7) essentially abrogated TGF-β1-induced IL-2Rα promoter activity (Fig. 4A). Although TGF-β1 only induced a 1.8-fold increase in activity of the WT construct in normal mouse T cells versus the high inducibility in EL4 and PC60 cells (Fig. 4A, top construct), selective mutation of components of PRRV reproducibly diminished even this induction, with the SBE mutants having the lease activity (Fig. 4A, constructs PRRVm1 through PRRVm7). The significance of PRRV for TGF-β1-induced IL-2Rα expression was verified using a long (> 13 kb) reporter construct that contains all of the PRRs (Fig. 4B). This construct exhibited lower activity with TGF-β alone than was seen with the PRRV-IL2Rα promoter construct shown in Fig. 4A. WT and mutant constructs all exhibited marked PI-inducibility in EL4 and PC60 cells. However, TGF-β1-mediated induction was abrogated, and the synergistic effect of PI with TGF-β1 was also markedly decreased in constructs in which the SBEs were mutated (Fig. 4B, see m1, m3, m5, and m7). Thus, TGF-β specifically acts via the Smad-binding elements. Essential Role for Smad3/4 and c-Jun Proteins in TGF-β1-induced IL-2Rα Gene Expression—To investigate the importance of Smad3 and AP-1 proteins for PRRV activity in vivo, we next used DN mutants of Smad3 and c-Jun (Smad3 3S→A, in which three C-terminal serines are converted to alanines (57Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and TAM67, in which the N-terminal trans-activation domain is deleted (50Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar), respectively). In EL4 cells stimulated with PI and TGF-β1, transfection of DN-Smad3 or TAM67 diminished PRRV activity, and the effect was greater when these constructs were combined (Fig. 5A). The essential role of Smad3 and Smad4 in TGF-β1-mediated IL-2Rα induction was next tested using Smad3 knock-out (KO) mice and T cell-specific Smad4 conditional KO mice. The TGF-β1-mediated increase in IL-2Rα expression seen in WT splenocytes treated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (Fig. 5B, top panel) was eliminated in Smad3 KO or Smad4 KO splenocytes (Fig. 5B, lower two panels). Together, the studies in Fig. 5 (A and B) demonstrate the vital role of Smad3/4 and c-Jun proteins in TGF-β1-induced IL-2Rα expression. Smad3 Binding to PRRV in Vivo Requires Both TGF-β and TCR Stimulation—We hypothesized that Smad3 and Smad4 were acting via the SBEs in PRRV. We therefore performed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to examine Smad binding to PRRV in vivo. As expected, stimulation with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 did not induce the binding of Smad3 to PRRV (Fig. 6, lane 12). Unexpectedly, Smad3 binding in vivo was not seen in cells stimulated with TGF-β1(lane 14). Strikingly, however, there was a high level of binding in cells stimulated with the combination of TGF-β1 and anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 (lane 16), demonstrating that both signals are required for potent Smad3 recruitment to PRRV. As a negative control for the chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we used PRRIII, which contains GAS motifs and Ets-binding sites but lacks an SBE. Although the mean Smad3 binding to PRRIII was slightly increased when anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 + TGF-β1 were combined (Fig. 6, open bars, lanes 15 versus lanes 9, 11, and 13), in two other experiments, there was no increase at all, indicating the specificity of the binding of Smad3 to PRRV (Fig. 6, closed bars, lane 16). Transcriptional regulation of the IL-2Rα gene has been extensively studied related to its induction in response to TCR and IL-2. Previously, four upstream and one intronic positive regulatory regions (PRRI, PRRII, PRRIII, PRRIV, and CD28rE) have been characterized, and the relevant DNA-binding proteins have been determined (9Lin J.X. Leonard W.J. Sehgal P.B. Levy D.E. Hirano T. Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (Stats). Dordrecht, The Netherlands2003: 435-463Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the nucleosomal organization has been partially analyzed (58Reeves R. Leonard W.J. Nissen M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4666-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These studies have collectively elucidated the basis for TCR-mediated and IL-2-mediated activation of the gene. We now demonstrate potent cooperative induction of the IL-2Rα gene in response to TGF-β and TCR signals. By searching for additional sequences conserved between humans and mice, we now have discovered PRRV, an element that contains a Smad3-binding element as well as motifs for AP-1 and CREB/ATF. We show that PRRV is required for TGF-β1-mediated induction of the IL-2Rα gene and that Smad3 binds to PRRV in vivo in a TGF-β1-inducible fashion when cells are also stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28. Moreover, analysis of Smad3 and c-Jun DN constructs as well as Smad3 and Smad4 KO mice reveal the critical role of Smad3, Smad4, and c-Jun in TGF-β-mediated IL-2Rα expression. Smad3 and Smad4 bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The minimal SBE contains only four base pairs, 5′-AGAC-3′ (59Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar, 61Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), although most naturally occurring SBEs are 5′-CAGAC-3′ motifs. Several copies of the SBE are required for TGF-β activation of a minimal promoter (61Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). This requirement may reflect the relatively low affinity of single SBEs for Smad proteins. We now demonstrate that PRRV contains three copies of the consensus SBE as well as adjacent AP-1 and CREB/ATF sites. The fact that most Smad-responsive enhancers contain only one copy of the SBE and that Smad proteins must cooperate with other Smad proteins and with other DNA-binding proteins such as AP-1 or CREB/ATF to elicit specific transcriptional responses (29Derynck R. Zhang Y.E. Nature. 2003; 425: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar) strongly suggested that PRRV be an efficient TGF-β response element. Both SMAD3 binding to PRRV by chromatin immunoprecipitation and enhanced restriction endonuclease accessibility at PRRV in vivo in response to TGF-β were observed only in the context of TCR stimulation. Because chromatin structure is known to be altered by T cell activation (62Siebenlist U. Durand D.B. Bressler P. Holbrook N.J. Norris C.A. Kamoun M. Kant J.A. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3042-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 63Agarwal S. Rao A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 64Rao S. Procko E. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4494-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that such alteration is needed for the effects of TGF-β at PRRV. TGF-β is a critical factor in regulating T cell-mediated immune responses and in the induction of immune tolerance (27Gorelik L. Flavell R.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Abrogation of TGF-β signaling in T cells in mice expressing a DN TGF-βR transgene results in dysregulated T cell proliferation and inflammatory and auto-immune-like diseases (39Gorelik L. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 171-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 40Lucas P.J. Kim S.J. Melby S.J. Gress R.E. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Although TGF-β regulation of immune responsiveness has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, the range of the actions of TGF-β and how it mediates these effects is not fully understood. In humans, after culturing naive CD4+ T cells with alloantigen in the presence of TGF-β, CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells are induced and potently suppress the development of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (65Yamagiwa S. Gray J.D. Hashimoto S. Horwitz D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7282-7289Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), indicating the cooperation of TGF-β and TCR signals. It is conceivable that the TGF-β response element in PRRV might exhibit differential specificity for IL-2Rα regulation in different T cell subsets, although support for such a model does not yet exist. Additional studies in this area may be informative. Recently, it was reported that murine CD4+ CD25+ anergic/suppressor T cells can be induced and may be derived from peripheral CD4+ CD25- naive responder T cells through costimulation via the TCR and TGF-β (66Chen W. Jin W. Hardegen N. Lei K.J. Li L. Marinos N. McGrady G. Wahl S.M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1875-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar). Importantly, our findings provide a molecular mechanism as to how TGF-β affects CD25 expression in a fashion that requires costimulation with the TCR. The integration of TCR, cytokine, and TGF-β response elements distributed over discrete positive regulatory regions spanning more than 10 kb provides a basis for the compartmentalized yet coordinated complex regulation of the IL-2Rα gene as summarized in Fig. 7. These findings have important implications for the regulation of the IL-2Rα gene not only in activated T cells but also in regulatory T cells and other lymphoid lineages. We thank Drs.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors and uncouplers decreased mitochondrial membrane potential leading to DAPK dephosphorylation and activation. The class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors attenuated DAPK dephosphorylation induced by mitochondrial toxins. Complex I inhibition by mitochondrial toxins (e.g. MPP+) resulted in mitochondrial swelling and lysosome reduction. Inhibition of class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase attenuated MPP+-induced lysosome reduction and cell death.

Defects in complexes I, II, and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain have been detected in several neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) (1Parker Jr., W.D.

Thus, it is of interest to fully understand the signaling consequences of inhibiting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Drugs inhibiting mitochondrial function decrease mitochondrial potential, depolarize mitochondria, and inhibit ATP production (8Nakai M. Mori A. Watanabe A. Mitsumoto Y. Exp.

Mitochondria, as stress-integration machinery, play a pivotal role in the determination of the life and death of cells in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (12Wright A.F. Jacobson S.G.

Identification of mitochondrial signaling pathways and the key lipid or protein affecting the cell death could provide new therapeutic targets for neurodegeneration and cancer. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) and lysosomes in autophagy and apoptosis induced by mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitors. DAPK is a cytosolic multidomain protein containing a catalytic domain, death domain, Ca2+/calmodulin domain, and ankyrin repeats that are involved in protein-protein interactions (18Shohat G. Shani G. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The pro-cell death mechanisms and the regulatory signaling pathways of DAPK are not fully understood. The present results indicate that DAPK is an effective sensor of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss in cells treated with respiratory chain inhibitors and mitochondrial uncoupling agents. The relevance of DAPK as a sensor of ΔΨm loss in cells treated with neurotoxic agents has been addressed. Materials—1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), rotenone, antimycin A, glucose oxidase, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, 3-nitropropionic acid, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), dinitrophenol, cyclosporin A, okadaic acid, rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, bafilomycin A, ammonium chloride, phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1, and mouse anti-phosphorylated DAPK were purchased from Sigma. BAPTA and JC-1 were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, Oregon). Mouse anti-DAPK protein antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse anti-actin antibody was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, California). Synthesis of Mito Vit-E—The method of Murphy and co-workers was used with some modifications (19Smith R.A.

This chroman was converted to the corresponding nitrile, which upon hydrolysis with aqueous ethylene glycol in potassium hydroxide, gave the corresponding acid. The acid was reduced to the alcohol that was converted to the bromo derivative by using carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in dimethyl formamide. The bromo derivative was heated with triphenylphosphine in dioxane for 10 days. The solid product was separated and purified by repeated precipitation from a dichloromethane solution by the addition of ether. The overall yield was nearly 25%. Synthesis of Mitoquinone (Mito-Q)—Mito-Q was synthesized according to the published method (20Dhanasekaran A. Kotamraju S. Kalivendi S.V. Matsunaga T. Shang T. Keszler A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J.

Briefly, 11-bromoperoxyundecanoic acid prepared from 11-bromoundecanoic acid was coupled with 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone to yield the 6-(10-bromodecyl) ubiquinone. The quinone was reduced to the quinol using sodium borohydride and heated with triphenylphosphine in dioxane for 4 days. The oily product separated from the reaction medium was purified and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. Culturing of Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells—Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) obtained from the American Type Cell Collection were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (4 mmol/liter), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. For the experiments, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to a confluence of 70-80%. Subcellular Fractionation and Aconitase Measurements—After treatment, cells were washed three times and scraped in 1-ml isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm potassium EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 20 μm fluorocitrate, 0.0035% digitonin, pH 7.4) (22Li Q.Y. Pedersen C. Day B.J. Patel M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cell suspension was homogenized in a tight-fitting glass/teflon homogenizer using 20 up-and-down strokes. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was resuspended in a 100 μl of isolation buffer. The activity of aconitase in the cytosol and mitochondrial fractions were measured in a 100-μl Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 8.0) containing 20 mm d,l-trisodium isocitrate. The rate of change of absorbance was followed for 3 min at 240 nm in a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer at room temperature. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitase of 3.6 mm-1 cm-1 at 240 nm was used to calculate the enzyme activity. Determination of DAPK Protein Levels—SH-SY5Y cells were washed with an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm sodium fluoride). To a 10-ml solution of the above were added 1% phosphatase inhibitors mixture 1 and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were homogenized, and the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with a mouse anti-phosphorylated DAPK monoclonal antibody. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Protein bands were detected using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, the blots were stripped twice and reprobed with an antibody against DAPK and actin, respectively. Electron Microscopy—SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes. After treatment with MPP+ at 1 mm for 24 h, media were removed as much as possible. The cells were washed once with prewarmed 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then 5 ml of cold freshly made fixative (2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) were poured into dishes to cover the cells. The cells were then placed on ice. Routine electron microscopy was performed after a 30-min fixation. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Measurement—Mitochondrial potential was assessed using the fluorescent potentiometric dye JC-1 as described previously (23Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with JC-1 (5 μg/ml) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min at 37 °C. After staining, the cells were collected at room temperature and washed three times with pre-warmed 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. JC-1 fluorescence was quantitated using a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer. The fluorescence of the JC-1 monomer was measured at 485 nm of excitation/530 nm of emission wavelength. The fluorescence of the JC-1 aggregate was measured at 535 nm of excitation/590 nm of emission wavelength. For each experiment, the aggregate monomer ratios were normalized to untreated controls (100%). MTT Assay—After treatment, the culture media were removed and cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mg/ml MTTfor 2 h at 37 °C. Media were removed and cells were solubilized and mixed thoroughly in isopropyl alcohol/0.08 n HCl (1:1). The absorption was measured at 562 nm with reference at 630 nm. Data Analysis—Statistical significance was obtained using a Student's t test employing the Sigmastat software. Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Inhibitors (Complexes I-IV) Induce DAPK Dephosphorylation and Cell Death—Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with MPP+ (1 mm) for 36 h increased cell toxicity, as measured by the cell viability assay (Fig. 1A). To investigate the mechanism of cell death, we monitored DAPK, which is involved in autophagic cell death. DAPK is activated by dephosphorylation via an unknown phosphatase. The dephosphorylation of DAPK was measured by Western blot using an antibody against phosphorylated DAPK. MPP+ treatment induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 1B, top row, and C). Next we examined the effects of rotenone, another mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, and antimycin A, the inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III. Rotenone (0.5 μm) treatment decreased the cell viability with time (Fig. 1D) and induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 1, E and F). The complex III site is another major site of ROS formation in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (24Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Antimycin A (4 μg/ml) treatment decreased the cell viability in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1G). It induced DAPK dephosphorylation as well (Fig. 1, H and I). Additional information concerning the mechanism of DAPK dephosphorylation was obtained using the inhibitors of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. Complex IV is not a major site of ROS production in mitochondria. Mitochondrial complex II inhibitors, 3-nitropropionic acid, and thenoyltrifluoroacetone time-dependently decreased the cell viability (Fig. 2, A and D) and induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and E). Treatment with sodium azide (2 mm), a mitochondrial complex IV inhibitor, also decreased the cell viability with time (Fig. 2G) and induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 2, H and I). Role of ROS in Mitochondrial Toxin-induced DAPK Dephosphorylation—Mitochondrial complexes I and III are major sites of ROS formation (24Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 25Lenaz G. Bovina C. D'Aurelio M. Fato R. Formiggini G. Genova M.L. Giuliano G. Merlo Pich M. Paolucci U. Parenti Castelli G. Ventura B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To investigate whether exogenously added oxidants induce DAPK dephosphorylation, we examined the effects of glucose/glucose oxidase (glucose/GO) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tert-BuOOH). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was generated in the media using the glucose/glucose oxidase (glucose/GO). Treatment with glucose/GO (10 milliunits/ml) or tert-BuOOH (200 μm) decreased the cell viability with time (Fig. 3, A and E). Aconitase serves an important sensor of intracellular oxidant formation (26Paraskeva E. Hentze M.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 24: 40-43Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Treatment with glucose/GO (10 milliunits/ml) or tert-BuOOH (200 μm) only decreased the cytosolic and not the mitochondrial aconitase activity (Fig. 3, B and F), suggesting a high level of cytosolic ROS compared with that in mitochondria. However, glucose/GO or tert-BuOOH treatment did not correspondingly induce DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 3, C and G), coinciding with increased cell death. These results suggest that cytosolic ROS may not be involved in DAPK dephosphorylation and activation. Mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor-induced ROS formation in the cytosol and mitochondria was examined by monitoring the corresponding aconitase activity. Treatment with MPP+ or antimycin A for 12 h decreased both the cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitase activities, indicating the formation of ROS in both compartments (Fig. 4, A and C). Treatment with rotenone for 12 h only decreased the cytosolic aconitase activity, not the mitochondrial aconitase activity, suggesting only cytosolic ROS formation at this time point (Fig. 4B). However, with prolonged incubation time (e.g. 18-36 h), rotenone treatment caused a decrease in the mitochondrial aconitase activity as well, suggesting ROS formation both in cytosol and mitochondria (data not shown). To investigate whether mitochondrial ROS are involved in DAPK dephosphorylation, the effects of mitochondrially targeted antioxidants, Mito-Q and Mito Vit-E, were determined. Mito-Q and Mito Vit-E are derivatives of ubiquinone and vitamin E, respectively. Ubiquinol has been reported to function as an antioxidant by donating a hydrogen atom from one of its hydroxyl groups to a lipid peroxyl radical, thereby decreasing lipid peroxidation within the inner membrane (19Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The ubisemiquinone radical formed during this process disproportionates into ubiquinone and ubiquinol. The respiratory chain subsequently recycles ubiquinone back to ubiquinol, restoring its antioxidant function (19Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The tocopheroxyl radical formed from the one-electron oxidation of vitamin E was proposed to regenerate vitamin E by reacting with ubiquinol (19Smith R.A. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Murphy M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Neither Mito-Q nor Mito Vit-E prevented MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, D and F). The effects of thiol antioxidants glutathione and N-acetylcysteine were investigated. Neither glutathione nor N-acetylcysteine prevented MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, H and J). These results suggest that mitochondrial ROS may not be involved in DAPK dephosphorylation and activation. However, additional studies with mitochondrial superoxide dismutase or catalase overexpressing cells are needed to further corroborate this conclusion. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨm) Loss Induces DAPK Dephosphorylation—As most mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors could effectively decrease ΔΨm, the effects of mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors on ΔΨm were determined using the JC-1 staining technique. As shown in Fig. 5A, all mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors decreased ΔΨm, as did the mitochondrial uncouplers CCCP and DNP. In contrast, glucose/GO and tert-BuOOH, which had no effect on DAPK dephosphorylation, did not decrease the ΔΨm. To confirm that ΔΨm reduction induces DAPK dephosphorylation, we investigated the effect of CCCP and DNP. Both CCCP and DNP induced DAPK dephosphorylation and activation (Fig. 5, B and C), indicating that DAPK is a sensor of ΔΨm. DAPK Dephosphorylation Is Mediated by a Class III PI 3-Kinase-dependent Phosphatase and Not by the mTOR Pathway—Next we defined the phosphatase that is responsible for DAPK dephosphorylation. PP1 and PP2A, which are inhibited by okadaic acid, were studied. Okadaic acid did not prevent the MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 6, A and B). ATP depletion was reported to activate PP2A (14Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Therefore, glucose (10, 20, or 50 mm) was added to the medium to increase the intracellular ATP levels. Previous reports indicated that the addition of glucose attenuated MPP+ toxicity in neuroblastoma cells via enhanced ATP synthesis (27Mazzio E. Soliman K.F. Brain Res. 2003; 962: 48-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Storch A. Kaftan A. Burkhardt K. Schwarz J. Brain Res. 2000; 855: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Glucose treatment, however, did not prevent MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D). These results suggest that PP1 and PP2A are unlikely to trigger DAPK dephosphorylation. The calcium-dependent phosphatase (PP2B), which is inhibited by cyclosporin A, was examined. Cyclosporin A treatment did not prevent MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 6, E and F). As the activity of PP2B is calcium-dependent, the effect of the calcium chelator, BAPTA, was examined. BAPTA treatment did not prevent MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 6, E and F). These results suggest that PP2B is not involved in DAPK dephosphorylation. The class I PI 3-kinase inhibits autophagy through the mTOR pathway, whereas inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin stimulates autophagy (29Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). mTOR is also a sensor of mitochondrial dysfunction. It was reported that ATP depletion and ΔΨm loss inhibit mTOR activity, resulting in the activation of PP2A and an undetermined phosphatase (14Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 23Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Rapamycin treatment did not prevent MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B). Interestingly, rapamycin treatment had a synergistic effect on MPP+-induced cell toxicity, as measured by the cell viability assay (Fig. 7C). MPP+ treatment for 36 h decreased cell viability to 65% of control; the cell viability significantly decreased to nearly 39% of control in the presence of rapamycin. The class III PI 3-kinase stimulates autophagy and is inhibited by 3-methyladeninine (3-MA) (29Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). 3-MA treatment attenuated MPP+-induced DAPK dephosphorylation (Fig. 7, D and E). 3-MA also increased the cell viability as compared with MPP+ alone (Fig. 7F). DAPK dephosphorylation and cell death induced by antimycin A (complex III inhibitor) were attenuated by 3-MA (Fig. 7, G-I). These results suggest that a class III PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphatase is involved in DAPK dephosphorylation. MPP+ Induces Lysosome Diminution and Not Autophagy in SH-SY5Y Cells—Unexpectedly, we observed a significant diminution of the lysosomes in MPP+-treated (24 h) SH-SY5Y cells as revealed by electron microscopy (Fig. 8). In MPP+-treated cells, there was mitochondrial swelling. Under these conditions, there was no nuclear condensation, suggesting a non-apoptotic mechanism of cell death. In the presence of 3-MA, there were more normal mitochondria and lysosomes compared with MPP+ alone. The double membranes of mitochondria were maintained in MPP+-treated cells, even under severely swollen conditions. The Western blotting technique was used to examine whether cytochrome c was released under these conditions. The majority of the cytochrome c was retained in the mitochondria, confirming that there was no intrinsic apoptotic cell death under these conditions (data not shown). It should, however, be noted that high concentrations of MPP+ induced apoptotic cell death in SH-SY5Y cells (31Kalivendi S.V. Kotamraju S. Cunningham S. Shang T. Hillard C.J. Kalyanaraman B. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Lysosome Inhibition Has Additive Effects on Mitochondrial Toxin-induced Cell Death—Lysosome activity was inhibited by NH4Cl and BafA. Treatment of cells with either MPP+, NH4Cl, or BafA alone resulted in cell death. In the presence of both MPP+ and NH4Cl or BafA, there was an additive decrease in the cell viability (Fig. 9, A and B). Similar results were obtained using the antimycin A (Fig. 9, C and D). Here we report that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. This was accompanied by an increase in DAPK dephosphorylation through a class III PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. The complex I inhibition by MPP+ and other mitochondrial toxins inhibited lysosomes. Inhibition of class III PI 3-kinase attenuated MPP+-induced lysosome reduction and cell death. Loss in ΔΨm induced DAPK dephosphorylation and activation leading to cell death. We propose that DAPK is an important sensor of ΔΨm (Scheme 1). We propose that depolarized mitochondria release a factor that leads to their specific removal. Previous results demonstrated that the direction of mitochondrial transport is modulated through a pathway that involves phosphatidylinositol (Scheme 1, Ptdins) (32De Vos K.J. Sable J. Miller K.E. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3636-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our findings connecting DAPK dephosphorylation and activation to a class III PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway also suggest that mitochondrial membrane-derived lipid second messengers are possibly involved in ΔΨm-induced mitochondrial turnover. Membrane lipid second messengers are generated when plasma membrane is depolarized (33Di Paolo G. Moskowitz H.S. Gipson K. Wenk M.R. Voronov S. Obayashi M. Flavell R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Ryan T.A. De Camilli P. Nature. 2004; 431: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Thus, similar messenger molecules are also generated during mitochondrial membrane depolarization (Scheme 1). Release of peptides from mitochondrial proteins presumably triggers the mitochondrial stress signaling pathway (34van Gurp M. Festjens N. van Loo G. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that a phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), which is an antagonist of the PI 3-kinase signaling cascade, was reported to be sensitive to mitochondrial redox status (17Connor K.M. Subbaram S. Regan K.J. Nelson K.K. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Bartholomew P.J. Aplin A.E. Tai Y.T. Aguirre-Ghiso J. Flores S.C. Melendez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16916-16924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PTEN antagonizes the class I PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and positively regulates autophagy (29Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that the mitochondrial membrane lipid second messenger is closely coupled to the mitochondrial function and is involved in the signaling cascade induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. ΔΨm-mediated DAPK Signaling in Mitochondrial Turnover—Mitochondria undergo a continuous turnover in cells (35Lipsky N.G. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8652-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depolarized or aged mitochondria are selectively eliminated by autophagy (36Xue L. Fletcher G.C. Tolkovsky A.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 361-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In neurons, mitochondria are synthesized in the cell bodies and are transported down the axon. Previously it was shown that the direction of mitochondrial transport correlated with ΔΨm (37Miller K.E. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2791-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Mitochondria with high ΔΨm values were transported toward the growth cone, and mitochondria with low ΔΨm values were transported toward the cell body for elimination by autophagy. The mechanism of directional transport and turnover of mitochondria is likely to be controlled by a sensor. This sensor should be able to sense ΔΨm and coordinate the regulation of the anterograde and retrograde motors, activating the autophagy-lysosome system. The following characteristics of DAPK enable it to function as a sensor in the mitochondrial stress-signaling pathway. First, using different mitochondrial toxins, we showed that DAPK is dephosphorylated and activated when ΔΨm is decreased. Second, bound to cytoskeleton, DAPK contains eight ankyrin repeats, suggesting that it is involved in a large number of cytoskeleton-protein interactions and phosphorylations (18Shohat G. Shani G. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transport involves cytoskeleton rearrangement and motor protein phosphorylation, such as kinesin and dynein (38Tanaka Y. Kanai Y. Okada Y. Nonaka S. Takeda S. Harada A. Hirokawa N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1147-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 39Habermann A. Schroer T.A. Griffiths G. Burkhardt J.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 229-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondrial transport mechanisms could be activated after DAPK is dephosphorylated and activated. Finally, DAPK is involved in autophagy, which is responsible for mitochondrial recycling (40Inbal B. Bialik S. Sabanay I. Shani G. Kimchi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). As DAPK can sense ΔΨm, regulate cytoskeleton and motor proteins, and activate autophagy, we propose that DAPK is an important signal transduction molecule in ΔΨm-induced mitochondrial turnover. Implications of ΔΨm Loss, DAPK Activation, and Cell Death in Neurodegenerative Diseases—It should be pointed out that DAPK dephosphorylation precedes cell death, and consequently, DAPK-mediated non-apoptotic cell death occurs at a later time point when compared with apoptotic cell death. Thus, any mismatch between the amount of DAPK dephosphorylation and the degree of cell death might be attributed to temporal differences in the onset of apoptotic and non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms. Environmental mitochondrial toxins (e.g. rotenone, MPP+) are thought to play an important role in sporadic Parkinson disease (41Lockwood A.H. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2000; 13: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These agents were used as model compounds to investigate the mechanism of pathogenesis of Parkinson disease in laboratory animals and humans (5Burns R.S. Chiueh C.C. Markey S.P. Ebert M.H.

Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). ΔΨm is involved in many physiological and pathological conditions, including apoptosis-dependent and -independent cell death (43Cohen I. Castedo M. Kroemer G. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 293-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 44Dan Z. Popov Y. Patsenker E. Preimel D. Liu C. Wang X.D. Seitz H.K. Schuppan D. Stickel F.

A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). By demonstrating that DAPK is activated by ΔΨm diminution, the present data incorporate DAPK into the mitochondrial death pathway. Although the exact cell death mechanisms are still not clearly understood, detailed investigations of the interactions with other proteins (e.g. Bcl-2 family proteins) involved in the mitochondrial pathway will provide important insights on the regulatory mechanism of DAPK in apoptosis and autophagy. Our findings that mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors result in ΔΨm diminution and DAPK activation suggest that DAPK may play a role as a sensor in mitochondrial diseases. DAPK is highly expressed in brain, especially in the hippocampus (30Yamamoto M. Takahashi H. Nakamura T. Hioki T. Nagayama S. Ooashi N. Sun X. Ishii T. Kudo Y. Nakajima-Iijima S. Kimchi A. Uchino S. J. Neurosci Res. 1999; 58: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). DAPK exists as an inactive form under physiological conditions, so the active form (dephosphorylated form) is a likely target for drug development in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson disease) and cancer."

A crucial step in this process is the binding of Sm proteins onto the SMN protein. For Sm B/B′, D1, and D3, efficient binding to SMN depends on symmetrical dimethyl arginine (sDMA) modifications of their RG-rich tails. This methylation is achieved by another entity, the PRMT5 complex. Its pICln subunit binds Sm proteins whereas the PRMT5 subunit catalyzes the methylation reaction. Here, we provide evidence that Lsm10 and Lsm11, which replace the Sm proteins D1 and D2 in the histone RNA processing U7 snRNPs, associate with pICln in vitro and in vivo without receiving sDMA modifications. This implies that the PRMT5 complex is involved in an early stage of U7 snRNP assembly and hence may have a second snRNP assembly function unrelated to sDMA modification. We also show that the binding of Lsm10 and Lsm11 to SMN is independent of any methylation activity. Furthermore, we present evidence for two separate binding sites in SMN for Sm/Lsm proteins. One recognizes Sm domains and the second one, the sDMA-modified RG-tails, which are present only in a subset of these proteins.

Schümperli D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although this cleavage reaction is biochemically distinct from the transesterifications involved in pre-mRNA splicing (reviewed in Ref. 2Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-357Google Scholar), the U7 snRNP particle resembles spliceosomal U snRNPs in various aspects of its structure and biogenesis. The spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) contain a conserved single-stranded sequence element, the Sm binding site, which interacts with the seven Sm proteins, B/B′, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G, to form an ring-shaped heteroheptamer, the so-called Sm core (3Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin.

In contrast, U7 snRNA has a somewhat degenerate Sm binding site. Earlier studies indicated that, when this U7-specific Sm binding site (AAUUUGUCUAG; U7 Sm WT) was changed to resemble the spliceosomal Sm binding sequence (AAUUUUUGGAG, Sm OPT), the resulting snRNPs were non-functional in histone RNA processing (6Grimm C. Stefanovic B. Schümperli D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Stefanovic B. Hackl W. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3141-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Later, when U7 snRNPs were purified to homogeneity, they were found to contain two U7-specific Sm-like proteins, Lsm10 and Lsm11, which replace Sm D1 and D2 in a U7-specific Sm core (8Pillai R.S.

Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The non-functionality of U7 Sm OPT snRNPs could be explained by the findings that U7 Sm OPT RNA forms a standard Sm core containing Sm D1 and D2 and that Lsm11 plays an essential functional role in histone RNA 3′-processing (8Pillai R.S. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Müller B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The assembly of Sm core structures occurs in the cytoplasm and is mediated by the multisubunit SMN complex (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Meister G. Eggert C. Fischer U.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This complex consists of intrinsic components, often referred to as Gemins, and substrate proteins, i.e. the Sm/Lsm proteins, which are transferred onto the U snRNA during assembly. We have obtained evidence that the spliceosomal and U7-specific kinds of Sm cores are assembled by separate SMN complexes that contain either Sm D1/D2 or Lsm10/11 along with the five common Sm proteins (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The presence of these separate and specialized SMN complexes raised the important question of how D1/D2 and Lsm10/11 gain access to the SMN complex and whether they occupy corresponding, mutually exclusive positions within this complex. Another complex involved in the assembly of at least a subset of Sm proteins into Sm core structures is the PRMT5 complex (also termed methylosome). One of its subunits, the protein methyl transferase PRMT5, catalyzes symmetrical dimethyl arginine (sDMA) modifications within RG repeats found in the Sm proteins B/B′, D1, and D3. It has also been shown that sDMA modifications are essential for binding of these proteins to the SMN complex (13Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In vivo, the PRMT5 complex may temporarily or permanently associate with the SMN complex to form a larger assembly engine (15Meister G. Fischer U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5853-5863Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here, we have addressed the question of whether the PRMT5 complex is involved in U7 snRNP assembly and how Lsm10/11 are incorporated into the SMN complex prior to U7 snRNP assembly. We find that both Lsm10 and Lsm11 associate with the pICln subunit of the PRMT5 complex in vitro and in vivo. The basis for this association appears to be a direct binding of both proteins to pICln through their respective Sm domains. However, neither Lsm10 nor Lsm11 appear to be substrates for sDMA modification, and their binding to SMN is independent of any methylation activity. Furthermore, we present evidence that the SMN protein has two binding modes for Sm/Lsm proteins. It can interact with the Sm domains of unmethylated Sm/Lsm proteins such that different members of this protein family can compete with each other for binding. Moreover, the methylated Sm/Lsm proteins exhibit another, strong binding mode, presumably through their sDMA-modified RG repeats, which cannot be competed by Sm domains. Plasmids—Plasmids derived from pcDNA3-HA (8Pillai R.S. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Müller B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) used for the expression of HA-tagged human Sm B, D1, D2, human Lsm10, or murine Lsm11 and of various truncations of the latter have been described elsewhere (8Pillai R.S.

Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and Lsm10 and Lsm11 cDNAs cloned in pET28a were used. For bacterial expression of fusion protein with an N-terminal GST tag, the coding region for the SMN N terminus and tudor domain (amino acids 1–160) was cloned into the pGex4T3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to yield a plasmid termed GST-SMN-(1–160). The full-length open reading frame of pICln was similarly cloned into pcDNA3-HA and pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Details of the constructs are available on request. GST Pull-down and Competition Assays—To study protein-protein interactions, recombinant proteins were isolated from Escherichia coli BL21 Gold transfected with pGex4T3 (negative control) or with pGex-derived plasmids containing SMN-(1–160) or pICln (see above). Unless indicated otherwise, 1–3 nmol of purified GST or GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated with [S35]methionine-labeled proteins obtained by coupled in vitro transcription/translation (see below). For competition experiments, 3.7 nmol of bacterially produced heterodimers of SmD1/D2 (16Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Lührmann R. Li J. Nagai K.

The beads and proteins were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 2 h while slowly turning on a rotating wheel, washed with phosphate-buffered saline/Nonidet P-40, and the bound and input materials were analyzed by 12% high TEMED SDS-PAGE (17Will C.L. Kastner B. Lührmann R. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 141-177Google Scholar) and detected on a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Coupled in Vitro Transcription/Translation—Protein substrates used for binding were produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation of pcDNA3-HA-derived plasmids for Lsm10, Lsm11, or Sm B, D1, or D2 in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT kit, Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine (Hartmann Analytic). To produce unmethylated Sm D1 or Sm B proteins, the reactions contained ∼100 nm of the methylation inhibitor S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). Coupled in vitro transcription/translation/methylation reactions were performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of 1 μm l-methionine and 2 μCi of S-[3H]adenosyl methionine. Reactions were analyzed by 15% high TEMED SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were subjected to fluorography using a Biomax transcreen LE (Kodak). Interaction Studies in Cell Extracts—Human 293-T cells were cultured as described (8Pillai R.S. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Müller B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For transfection, they were grown in 10-cm dishes to 50–60% confluency and transfected with 10 μg of the pcDNA3-HA-derived plasmids complexed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). Cells were harvested 48-h post-transfection. The preparation of small scale whole cell extracts, nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts, and precipitations with biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-ends of U7 or U1 snRNA were performed as described (8Pillai R.S.

Hames B.D. RNA Processing. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 141-177Google Scholar), blotted, and probed with appropriate antibodies and developed by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—The following antibodies were used: Monoclonal antibodies 7B10 for SMN (18Meister G. Bühler D. Laggerbauer B. Zobawa M. Lottspeich F. Fischer U. Hum.

For indirect immunodetection in Western blots anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Promega) were used. The HA epitope was detected with anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) directly coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Interaction of Lsm10 and Lsm11 with pICln through Their Respective Sm Domains—In a yeast two-hybrid screen of 174,000 primary transformants using human Lsm10 as the bait, we isolated two full-length cDNA clones encoding the pICln subunit of the PRMT5 complex. These clones produced very strong β-galactosidase signals and did not transactivate the reporter genes in combination with four unrelated proteins used as baits or with the DNA binding domain alone (data not shown). To confirm this interaction and to analyze whether the other U7-specific Lsm protein, Lsm11, might also bind to pICln, we performed in vitro binding experiments. Lsm10, Lsm11, and Sm B were translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and then incubated either with GST or with a GST-pICln fusion protein attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were precipitated, washed, and their protein content was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. All three proteins clearly bound to GST-pICln (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9). For Lsm10 and Lsm11 this binding was caused by the pICln moiety, as no protein bound to GST alone (lanes 4 and 5). A trace of Sm B was precipitated by GST (lane 6), but the amount precipitated by GST-pICln was much higher, indicating that this previously described interaction (14Meister G. Eggert C. Bühler D. Brahms H. Kambach C. Fischer U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) also preferentially occurred through the pICln moiety. To study the relevance of these interactions, we analyzed whether they can also be detected in cell extracts. To this end, extracts from human 293-T cells expressing HA-tagged Lsm10, Lsm11 or various deletion mutants of the latter were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-pICln antibodies, and the precipitated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. Both Lsm10 (Fig. 2A) and full-length Lsm11 (Fig. 2B, top) were specifically precipitated by the anti-pICln antibody but not by the beads alone. In the large Lsm11 protein, the first Sm motif is preceded by an N-terminal extension of 170 amino acids, and the Sm motifs 1 and 2 that form the Sm domain are separated by 138 amino acids (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two different deletions of the N terminus (ΔN104, ΔN140) or a deletion of 77 amino acids from the spacer separating the two Sm motifs (Δsp77) still allowed the interaction with pICln in vivo to occur (Fig. 2B). Note that all of these deleted proteins are also incorporated into U7 snRNPs in these cells (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D.

In contrast, an HA-tagged fragment of amino acids 1–136, which does not contain any of the Sm motifs did not associate with pICln in vivo (Fig. 2B, N136). Taken together, these results indicate that Lsm10 and Lsm11 interact with pICln both in vitro and in vivo and that, for Lsm11, this interaction occurs primarily if not exclusively through the Sm domain. Interaction of Lsm11 with Other Members of the PRMT5 Complex—To test whether the U7-specific proteins interact with the complete PRMT5 complex or only with pICln, we performed a similar immunoprecipitation experiment with extracts from 293-T cells expressing full-length HA-Lsm11 and with antibodies specific for PRMT5 and WDR77. As shown in Fig. 2C, Lsm11 interacts not only with pICln but also with these other subunits of the PRMT5 complex. Binding of pICln to Free Sm/Lsm Proteins Prior to snRNP Assembly—Because pICln binds Sm and Lsm proteins through their Sm motifs, we wanted to know whether it interacts with these proteins prior to or after their assembly into snRNPs. To address this question, HA-tagged pICln was transiently transfected into human 293-T cells. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from these cells were then precipitated with magnetic streptavidin beads after the addition of biotinylated oligonucleotides complementary to either U7 or U1 snRNAs or without oligonucleotide. The presence or absence of HA-tagged pICln in the precipitates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. No precipitation of HA-pICln was observed with either the U7- or U1-specific oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A, top panels), although the method readily precipitated the Sm B/B' that is associated with both kinds of snRNPs (lower panels). Note that the U7 snRNP is less abundant and that, therefore, less B/B′ was precipitated. In control experiments, the expressed HA-pICln was readily precipitated from the cytoplasmic extract with antibodies against Sm proteins (Y12) or against Lsm11 (Fig. 3B, right panel), indicating that it shows the same interactions as observed for endogenous pICln (see Fig. 2 above). As the Y12 antibody is known to react primarily with the sDMA-modified repeats of Sm B, D1 and D3 (20Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Lührmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), we also tested an antibody raised against a bacterially produced, unmethylated heterodimer of Sm D1 and D2. This antibody also precipitated HA-pICln (data not shown). We note that, although HA-pICln is mostly cytoplasmic, a small fraction of it is also present in the nucleus. However, only traces of the nuclear HA-pICln (which may reflect a low level of cytoplasmic contamination) are associated with Sm proteins or with Lsm11. Taken together with the previous results, these findings indicate that pICln (or the PRMT5 complex) does not bind mature assembled snRNPs but only free Sm or Lsm proteins before their assembly into mature snRNPs. Binding of Lsm10 and Lsm11 to SMN Is Independent of Symmetrical Arginine Dimethylation—Having found that Lsm10 and Lsm11 interact with pICln, which is part of the PRMT5 complex that mediates sDMA modification of RG repeats in certain Sm proteins (13Friesen W.J.

Bühler D. Brahms H. Kambach C. Fischer U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we asked whether the two U7-specific proteins are substrates for this kind of modification. Human/mouse Lsm11 contain 10/6 RGs and 9/6 GR dipeptides, respectively (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For human/mouse Lsm10, there are 0/1 RGs and 4/3 GRs (8Pillai R.S. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Schümperli D. Müller B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5470-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However there is only one cluster of RG or GR dipeptides in the N terminus of Lsm11, which is removed by both of the N-terminal deletions described in Fig. 2. It is possible to determine whether proteins are substrates for methylation by coupled transcription/translation in the presence of tritiated S-adenosyl methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate which contains the PRMT5 methylation complex (and possibly PRMT7, which also catalyzes sDMA modifications (21Miranda T.B. Miranda M. Frankel A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22902-22907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Lee J.H. Cook J.R. Yang Z.H. Mirochnitchenko O.

Such assays were carried out with plasmids encoding Sm B, Lsm10, and Lsm11. Control reactions carried out in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine either without (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3) or with 3S-[H]adenosyl methionine (lanes 4–6) proved that all three proteins were efficiently synthesized in the rabbit reticulocyte system. However, only Sm B (lane 7), but not Lsm10 (lane 8) or Lsm11 (lane 9), were detectable by fluorography after translation in the presence of S-[3H]adenosyl methionine and unlabeled methionine. These results confirm that Sm B is a methylation substrate. Most importantly, however, they strongly suggest that Lsm10 and Lsm11 are not substrates for sDMA modification, although a weak signal from only one or a few methylated arginines might have escaped detection. In the case of the Sm/Lsm proteins that are substrates for sDMA modification by the PRMT5 complex (i.e. Sm B/B′, D1 and D3, as well as Lsm4), the methylations are important for efficient binding to SMN and the SMN complex (13Friesen W.J.

Bühler D. Brahms H. Kambach C. Fischer U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1990-1994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached, among others, by experiments in which the proteins were translated either in the absence or presence of the methylation inhibitor S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH). We therefore analyzed whether translation of Lsm10 and Lsm11 in the presence of SAH had similar effects on the subsequent binding to SMN as was the case for Sm B. As a test for binding, precipitation experiments were performed with recombinant proteins GST-SMN (1–160) or GST (as negative control) that had been immobilized on glutathione beads. Note that the SMN fragment used consists of amino acids 1–160 and contains the binding site for Sm proteins (23Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Bühler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In such binding assays, all three Sm/Lsm proteins interacted with GST-SMN-(1–160) (Fig. 5A, lane 5) but not with GST alone (lane 3). As expected, the binding of Sm B to SMN was strongly reduced when the in vitro translation had been carried out in the presence of SAH (lane 6). We also observed a shift in electrophoretic mobility of Sm B that presumably reflected the difference in sDMA modification (compare lanes 1 and 2 or 5 and 6). In contrast, the binding of Lsm10 and Lsm11 to GST-SMN-(1–160) was not affected by the inhibition of methylation (lane 6), and there also was no detectable mobility shift. Thus methylation of Lsm10 and Lsm11, if it occurs at all, is not important for the interaction of these proteins with SMN. Next we analyzed whether the two N-terminal truncations described in Fig. 2 could still interact with GST-SMN-(1–160). In these truncation mutants, all RG/GR dipeptide repeats have been deleted. Both Lsm11ΔN104 and Lsm11ΔN140 specifically bound to GST-SMN-(1–160) (Fig. 5B, lanes 10–12), but not to the GST control (lanes 6–8). Moreover, in immunoprecipitation experiments with extracts from transfected cells similar to those shown in Fig. 2, we found that the same HA-tagged Lsm11 deletions could be precipitated by anti-SMN antibody upon transient expression in 293-T cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we have previously shown that the N-terminally deleted Lsm11 proteins still assemble into U7 snRNPs in vivo (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore these experiments indicate that the N terminus of Lsm11 is not required for interactions with SMN protein or the SMN complex, be it in vitro or in vivo. Considering all the above results, binding of Lsm10 or Lsm11 to SMN occurs independently of arginine methylation. Evidence for Separate Binding Sites on SMN for Sm Domains and Methylated RG-rich Tails of Sm/Lsm Proteins—Both the spliceosomal and U7-specific Sm core structures are assembled in the cytoplasm with the help of the SMN complex (9Pillai R.S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We have previously obtained evidence for two separate kinds of SMN complexes that contain either Sm D1/D2 or Lsm10/11 and which are devoted to spliceosomal or U7 snRNP assembly, respectively (9Pillai R.S. Grimmler M. Meister G. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Fischer U. Schümperli D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2321-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To begin to address the question how these different types of SMN complexes are formed, we analyzed whether the relevant proteins, Sm D1, D2, and Lsm10, Lsm11, bind to SMN in the same way. In particular, we wanted to know whether Sm D1, D2 can compete with Lsm10, Lsm11 for binding to SMN or vice versa. For this purpose, the binding of these proteins to GST-SMN-(1–160) was analyzed in the absence or presence of an excess of purified recombinant Sm D1/D2 heterodimer used as competitor. As expected, in the absence of competitor all four proteins bound to the immobilized GST-SMN-(1–160) (Fig. 6A, lane 3) but not to the GST negative control (lane 2). Interestingly, however, the recombinant Sm D1/D2 heterodimer competed for the binding to GST-SMN-(1–160) with the in vitro translated Lsm11, Lsm10, and Sm D2 proteins, but not with Sm D1 (compare lanes 4 to 3). An important difference between the in vitro translated Sm D1 used as binding substrate and the recombinant D1 present in the heterodimer used as competitor resides in the sDMA modification of the C-terminal RG tail. It is possible that SMN may have"

To quantitatively characterize the contribution of the F0 subunits to the binding of F1 within the assembled holoenzyme, the isolated subunit b dimer, ab2 subcomplex, and fully assembled F0 complex were specifically labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide at bCys64 and functionally reconstituted into liposomes. Proteoliposomes were then titrated with increasing amounts of Cy5-maleimide-labeled F1 (at γCys106 and analyzed by single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer.

F-type ATPases (F1F0) are ubiquitously abundant in the inner membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria, where they catalyze the synthesis of ATP by oxidative or photophosphorylation. In bacteria, the enzyme can also work in the opposite direction to generate proton or sodium gradients at the expense of ATP. Despite slight variations in subunit composition among species, F1F0 complexes share a high homology with respect to the mechanism of catalysis, in which ion translocation through the membrane-embedded F0 part is rotationally coupled to ATP synthesis/hydrolysis in F1 (1Weber J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because of the rotary mechanics, in addition to the structural classification of this multisubunit enzyme complex in F1 (subunit composition α3β3γδϵ in Escherichia coli) and F0 (ab2c10) (2Fillingame R.H. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), a functional classification into rotor and stator is also used.

Accordingly, a similar mode of elastic coupling during catalysis has recently been suggested for the subunit c ring of the rotor part from the Na+-translocating ATP synthase of Ilyobacter tartaricus (13Meier T.

Because of the transient storage of elastic energy during catalysis, subunit interactions between components of the stator have to be rather strong to withstand a rotary strain of up to 55 kJ mol-1, i.e. the maximum ΔG observed for ATP synthesis (19Pänke O.

Although there are several binding partners for subunit b within the stator in F1, each of which contributes to binding affinity (21Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol.

In the case of the interaction of subunit b with F1, binding affinities have so far been determined only in solution by several techniques, including fluorometric tryptophan quenching (1Weber J.

However, in these assays, only truncated forms of subunit b lacking the membrane part were used, thereby confusing the interpretation of the corresponding results with a rather weak dissociation constant for dimerization (20Diez M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two copies of subunit b were shown to interact also within the transmembrane portion of the polypeptide (26Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the use of soluble F1 and single F0 subunits in titration assays does not allow testing of functional F1/F0 interactions because of the lack of the membrane-embedded F0 part of the enzyme. It has previously been shown that, in the case of reconstituted F0 and its subcomplexes, all three subunits a, b, and c are necessary for the functional binding of F1 (11Greie J.-C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3040-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Stalz W.-D. Greie J.-C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol.

In this study, F1/F0 interactions were quantified for the first time using functionally reconstituted protein complexes. The binding of F1 to the subunit b dimer and ab2 stator subcomplexes as well as to fully assembled F0 has been observed by single-molecule FRET, also introducing a new approach in the spectroscopic analysis of binding constants in F1/F0 interaction. The binding constants clearly demonstrate that both rotor and stator components of F0 contribute to F1 binding affinity in the assembled holoenzyme.

To purify the ab2 subcomplex, everted membrane vesicles were prepared at 4 °C by resuspending 50 g of DK8/pTOM3.1aHis12 cells in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 μg/ml DNase, followed by cell disruption with a Constant Systems Basic Z cell disrupter (IUL Instruments GmbH) at a pressure of 1.36 kilobars. The membrane suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. To separate everted membrane vesicles from the cytosolic fraction, the supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h. To remove F1, membranes were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol; resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 m urea, and 10% (v/v) glycerol; and incubated overnight. Membranes were collected by centrifugation and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10% (v/v) glycerol. For solubilization, membranes (10 mg/ml) were stirred with 1.4% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Glycon Corp.) at 4 °C for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged at 232,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen Inc.)/10 mg of membrane protein at 4 °C for 1 h. The agarose matrix was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The agarose was then packed into an empty glass column and washed with 5–10 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. To remove unspecifically bound protein, the imidazole concentration was temporarily increased to 60 mm for 5–10 column volumes, followed by a decrease to 10 mm for another 5–10 column volumes. Detergent was exchanged from DDM to Na+ cholate using 5–10 column volumes of the equilibration buffer containing 1% (w/v) Na+ cholate instead of DDM. Elution of the ab2 subcomplex with 250 mm imidazole was preceded by a gradient from 10 to 55 mm imidazole within 10 column volumes. Eluted protein was concentrated to 0.5–1 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter devices (molecular weight cutoff of 10,000; Millipore Corp.) and dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% (w/v) Na+ cholate, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 24 h with changing the buffer once. Labeling F0 Components and F1—Isolated F0, subunit b, and ab2 subcomplex were labeled with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR) (Molecular Probes, Inc.), whereas purified F1 was labeled with Cy5-maleimide (referred to as Cy5; Amersham Biosciences). The dyes were determined after a 1000-fold dilution with methanol using the extinctioncoefficients provided by the supplier. The Forster radius (R0) for this FRET pair is ∼6.4 nm (7Diez M. Zimmermann B. Börsch M. König M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A. Gräber P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). F0 and subcomplexes thereof were labeled at bCys64 with TMR in 10 mm Tris/NaOH (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Na+cholate, and 10% (v/v) glycerol on ice in the presence of a 5-fold excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Molecular Probes, Inc.) with respect to protein to prevent the formation of disulfides. To avoid the labeling of both b subunits within the dimer, the degree of labeling was adjusted to ∼35% by applying the fluorescent dye at different molar ratios and incubation times, i.e. for F0, a molar ratio of 1:1 for 3 h; for the ab2 subcomplex, a molar ratio of 1:5 for 4.5 h; and for subunit b, a molar ratio of 1:5 for 1.5 h. In the latter case, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm MgCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) DDM was used. Unbound dye and tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride were removed using pre-equilibrated Sephadex G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The labeling degrees (β) were calculated from the concentration ratio of bound dye and protein according to the following: β = ([labeled protein]/[total protein]) × 100% = ((A556/ϵ556(TMR))/(A278(protein)/ϵ278(protein))) × 100% and A278(protein) = A278(total) - A278(TMR) = (A278(total) - (ϵ278(TMR)/ϵ556(TMR)) × A556, where A278 and A556 are the absorbance at 278 and 556 nm, respectively; and ϵ278 and ϵ556 are the extinction coefficients at 278 and 556 nm, respectively. The concentrations were determined from UV-visible absorption spectra of the labeled proteins using ϵ278(F0) = 136,000 m-1 cm-1, ϵ278(ab2) = = 108,000 m cm-1, ϵ278(TMR) = 19,500 m-1 cm-1, and ϵ556(TMR) = 95,000 M-1 cm-1, yielding TMR labeling rates of 32% for F0 and 36% for the ab2 subcomplex. The rather low absorbance of subunit b (ϵ278 = 7100 m-1 cm-1) was masked by the absorbance of TMR itself. Thus, for TMR-labeled subunit b, the protein concentration was determined with the enhanced BCA protein assay (Pierce) using unlabeled subunit b as a standard. The TMR concentration was then measured by UV-visible spectroscopic absorption analysis, from which a labeling degree of 29% was calculated. F1 was labeled at γCys106 with Cy5 at a molar ratio of 1:0.9 in 50 mm MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.0) and 100 μm MgCl2 on ice for 4 min (36Börsch M. Turina P. Eggeling C. Fries J.R. Seidel C.A. Labahn A. Gräber P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unbound dye was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50. A labeling degree (α) of ∼58% was calculated from UV-visible absorption spectra (for details, see above) using ϵ650(Cy5) = 250,000 m-1 cm-1, ϵ278(Cy5) = 41,100 m-1 cm-1, and ϵ278(F1) = 205,500 m-1 cm-1. Solutions of labeled protein were frozen in liquid nitrogen after addition of 10% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Reconstitution of F0, the ab2 Subcomplex, and Subunit b into Liposomes and Reassembly with F1—Liposomes from phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid were prepared by dialysis (37Fischer S. Gräber P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). TMR-labeled F0, ab2 subcomplex, and subunit b were reconstituted according to Fischer et al. (38Fischer S. Etzold C. Turina P. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Gräber P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The final concentration of proteoliposomes was 8 mg/ml of lipid in 20 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0), 20 mm succinate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.6 mm KOH. For the determination of catalytic activities and ensemble fluorescence measurements, the enzyme concentration was adjusted to 40 nm. In the case of single-molecule fluorescence measurements, the concentration of reconstituted protein was 15 nm, resulting in an average number of less than one enzyme molecule/liposome (8Zimmermann B. Diez M. Nawid Z. Gräber P. Börsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were incubated with different concentrations of labeled F1 (0, 0.09, 0.9, 9, 49, 89, 222, and 444 nm) in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm NaCl for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by a 90-min incubation on ice. Unbound F1 was removed by subsequent centrifugation at 265,000 × g for 90 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0), 20 mm succinate, 0.6 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 4% (v/v) glycerol. Fluorescence Measurements—Ensemble fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C using an SLM-AMINCO 8100 spectrofluorometer with a slit width of 4 nm. Spectra were corrected for lamp intensity and detection efficiency. Single-molecule fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C using a confocal microscope (100-μm pinhole size) of local design. The laser beam (532 nm, frequency-doubled neodymium/yttrium aluminum garnet; Coherent Inc.) was attenuated to 100 microwatts and directed into an Olympus water immersion objective (UApo 40×, numerical aperture of 1.15). This power level created sufficiently high fluorescence signals, but still kept photobleaching negligible. For epiillumination, a 545 nm DCLP dichroic mirror (AHF Corp.) was used. Fluorescence was subdivided by a 630 nm DCLP dichroic mirror into two spectral ranges with λ < 630 nm for TMR and λ > 630 nm for Cy5 and detected with two avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-AQR 151, EG&G). Filters (HQ 575/65 nm for TMR and HQ 665 nm LP for Cy5) were used to block laser light scattering and to reduce the cross-talk of TMR into the Cy5 detection channel to 5.4%. The excitation efficiency of Cy5 at 532 nm was <0.03 times that of TMR. Photons were recorded simultaneously (1-ms time resolution) with a multiscaler photon counter (PMS-300, Becker & Hickl GmbH). Samples were analyzed on a microscope slide with a cavity of ∼85 μl covered with a cover glass. Labeled proteoliposomes were diluted to a final concentration of ∼100 pm in 20 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.0), 20 mm succinate, 0.6 mm KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2. At this concentration, one liposome at most was present in the confocal volume at the same time. For fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), only the photons of the TMR channel were used to calculate the autocorrelation function (G(τc)) by an ALV 5000/E FAST real-time correlator. For a quantitative interpretation, we used the following function, which contains a diffusion term and a contribution of one triplet state (Equation 1),G(τc)=1+1NF11+τc/τD·11+(ω0/Z0)2τc/τD1/2·(1-T+T(-τc/τT))(Eq. 1) where G(τc) is the autocorrelation function; NF is the average number of fluorescent molecules in the detection volume; τc is the correlation time; τD = ω20/4D is the characteristic time of diffusion with D (diffusion coefficient); τT is the characteristic triplet time; T is the average fraction of molecules in the excited triplet state; and ω0 and z0 are the 1/e2 radii of the gaussian detection volume in the radial and axial directions, respectively. The actual confocal detection volume (V = 7.7 fl) was calculated from the FCS data of rhodamine 6G in water as described (36Börsch M. Turina P. Eggeling C. Fries J.R. Seidel C.A. Labahn A. Gräber P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For FCS, samples were diluted to a final concentration of 2–5 nm, which yielded a mean value of 5–10 molecules within the confocal volume at the same time. For every single-molecule FRET titration experiment, three independent measurements were performed. To determine the diffusion times (τD), the autocorrelation functions were fitted by Equation 1. All best fits of FCS data resulted in similar values for the triplet contribution, i.e. τT (4 μs) and T (0.03–0.07). Determination of Kd by Single-molecule FRET Analysis—Single-molecule FRET data were analyzed by the custom-made software Burst Analyzer. After correction of background count rates (0.5–2 counts/ms) and cross-talk of TMR into the Cy5 channel, photon bursts were selected by the following criteria. 1) A duration time of >20 ms identified photon bursts originating from labeled proteoliposomes with a corresponding mean diffusion time through the confocal detection volume. 2) Count rates higher than 10 photons/ms for the TMR channel or higher than seven photons/ms for the Cy5 channel enabled the unambiguous determination of the presence of both fluorophores in the proteoliposome. 3) Photon bursts were excluded from further analysis if the total count rate, i.e. the sum of photons in the donor and acceptor channels, was >7000 because these bursts presumably indicate aggregates of liposomes. For each selected burst, the apparent mean FRET efficiency was calculated by Eapp = IA/(IA + ID), with IA and ID being the corrected intensities of Cy5 (acceptor) and TMR (donor), respectively. Bursts were classified as either donor-only events (Eapp ≤ 0.05) or FRET events (Eapp > 0.05), and the ratio of FRET events to all events was calculated and plotted against the F1 concentration. Assays—Protein concentrations were determined either by the BCA assay used as recommended by the supplier or by UV absorption spectroscopy using the extinction coefficients given above (39Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (16.5% T and 6% C separating gels together with 4% T and 3% C stacking gels) (40Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) and detected by silver staining (41Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). Specificity of subunit labeling was controlled by fluorescence detection of protein bands. ATPase activities were measured in an ATP-regenerating system (42Fischer S. Gräber P. Turina P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30157-30162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 18 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 16 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 mm NADH. ATP synthesis was measured after an acid-base transition in the presence of an additional K+/valinomycin diffusion potential at room temperature (43Turina P. Samoray D. Gräber P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 20 μl of F1F0 liposomes (40 nm) were incubated for 3 min with 80 μl of 20 mm succinate/NaOH (pH 4.7), 5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.6 mm KOH, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ADP, and 20 μm valinomycin. 100 μl of the acidified suspension were then mixed with 900 μl of 200 mm Tricine/NaOH (pH 8.8), 5 mm NaH2PO4, 160 mm KOH, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ADP. The formation of ATP was monitored with a luciferin/luciferase assay. Purification and Fluorescence Labeling of Proteins—To observe binding of F1 to F0 and components thereof by intramolecular FRET, it was necessary to specifically label one subunit of each of the binding partners. All subunits were isolated and labeled with TMR (F0, ab2 subcomplex, and subunit b) or with Cy5 (F1) as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). Labeling degrees were determined by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy as described under “Experimental Procedures” and calculated to be 29–36% for TMR-labeled bCys64 in F0, the ab2 subcomplex, and subunit b and 58% for Cy5-labeled F1 γCys106. For the ab2 subcomplex and subunit b, UV illumination of the SDS gel revealed an additional slightly fluorescent protein band corresponding to the subunit b dimer. In the case of F0, the remaining impurities did not superimpose on the fluorescence of TMR at bCys64, which was required for the FRET analysis. γCys106 of purified F1 showed highly specific labeling with Cy5. The silver-stained SDS gel also revealed partial degradation of subunit δ, which has already been observed as a common problem in F1 preparations (44Rodgers A.J. Wilkens S. Aggeler R. Morris M.B. Howitt S.M. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31058-31064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Functionality of Labeled Proteins—Previous studies revealed the functionality of isolated F0, ab2 subcomplex, and subunit b by passive proton translocation through F0 reconstituted from subcomplexes as well as from single subunits (11Greie J.-C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3040-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Stalz W.-D. Greie J.-C. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 3036-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To exclude a possible influence of the dye on the catalytic function of F1 and the coupling to F0, the rates of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis were determined with both the labeled and unlabeled enzymes. Isolated F0 was reconstituted into liposomes; and after binding of F1, all samples revealed nearly the same rate of ATP synthesis of ∼15 s-1 (TABLE ONE). Accordingly, ATP hydrolysis turnover rates of ∼120 s-1 were determined for isolated F1, whether Cy5-labeled or not. Both assays clearly demonstrate that the functionality of F1 and F0 was not affected by the"
https://openalex.org/W2136185341,"A novel bioactive form of neurotensin post-translationally modified at a Glu residue was isolated from porcine intestine. Purification of the peptide was guided by detection of intracellular Ca2+ release in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Using high resolution accurate mass analysis on an ion trap Fourier transform mass spectrometer, the post-translational modification was identified as arginine linked to the γ-carboxyl of Glu via an isopeptide bond, and we named the newly identified peptide “arginylated neurotensin” (R-NT, N-(neurotensin-C5–4-yl)arginine). Although arginylation is a known modification of N-terminal amino groups in proteins, its presence at a Glu side chain is unique. The finding places neurotensin among the few physiologically active peptides that occur both in post-translationally modified and unmodified forms. Pharmacologically, we characterized R-NT for its ligand activity on three known neurotensin receptors, NTR1, -2, and -3, and found that R-NT has similar pharmacological properties to those of neurotensin, however, with a slightly higher affinity to all three receptors. We expressed the intracellular receptor NTR3 as a soluble protein secreted into the cell culture medium, which allowed characterization of its R-NT and neurotensin binding properties. The creation of soluble NTR3 also provides a potential tool for neutralizing neurotensin action in vivo and in vitro. We have shown that SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells express NTR1 and NTR3 but not NTR2, suggesting that the Ca2+ mobilization elicited by R-NT is via NTR1.

Orphan G-protein-coupled receptors are present in established cell lines and may serve as screening systems to find their endogenous ligands. In the present study, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were utilized to screen for novel peptides in porcine duodenal extracts using intracellular Ca2+ release as a reporter system. However, SK-N-SH cells also express other G-protein-coupled receptors and may respond to a number of neuropeptides. The bioactivities were followed by peptide purification and subsequent structural characterization, yielding peptides of potential physiological significance, among them a unique form of neurotensin. Neurotensin is a 13-residue peptide that was first isolated from bovine hypothalamus during purification of substance P and was named from its neuronal localization and a vasodilatation after local administration (1Carraway R. Leeman S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6854-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neurotensin is localized to both the central nervous system and peripheral tissues mainly in the gastrointestinal tract (2Kitabgi P. Carraway R. Leeman S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7053-7058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, neurotensin plays the role of a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator of dopamine transmission and of anterior pituitary hormone secretion (3Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It also shows potent hypothermic and analgesic effects in the brain (4Bissette G. Nemeroff C.B. Loosen P.T. Prange Jr., A.J. Lipton M.A. Nature. 1976; 262: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Neurotensin has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several brain diseases, such as schizophrenia and Huntington and Parkinson diseases (5Garver D.L. Bissette G. Yao J.K. Nemeroff C.B. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1991; 148: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the periphery, neurotensin acts as a local hormone exerting a paracrine and endocrine modulation of the digestive tract (3Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Kitabgi P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 302-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It also stimulates the growth of various gastrointestinal tissues, including the pancreas and the gastric antrum (6Feurle G.E. Muller B. Rix E.

Botto J.M. Honore E. Bourdel E. Martinez J. Costentin J. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Mazella J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 503-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For signal transduction, NTR1 is coupled with Ca2+ signaling. Activation of NTR1 by neurotensin leads to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. NTR2 was discovered based on its homology to NTR1. Recent studies show that NTR2 is involved in neurotensin-induced analgesia (12Dubuc I. Sarret P. Labbe-Jullie C. Botto J.M. Honore E. Bourdel E. Martinez J. Costentin J. Vincent J.P. Kitabgi P. Mazella J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 503-510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NTR2 has been shown to bind neurotensin and can be activated by neurotensin when NTR2 is expressed in Xenopus oocyte. However, unlike NTR1, which stimulates Ca2+ in mammalian cells, recombinant NTR2, when expressed in HEK293 cells, does not activate Ca2+ signaling in response to neurotensin stimulation. NTR3 normally exists in intracellular compartments and not on the cell surface. NTR3 expression has been reported in rat adipocytes in vesicles containing the glucose transporter GLUT4 and mouse neurons (13Morris N.J. Ross S.A. Lane W.S. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Keller S.R.

Insulin or neurotensin stimulation of rat adipocytes or mouse neurons, respectively, has been reported to trigger the translocation of NTR3 from the intracellular compartment to the cell surface.

Earlier structural analyses of hormonal peptides have shown that several peptides are post-translationally modified. The most frequently occurring post-translational modification is C-terminal amidation found in peptide hormones such as secretin (14Jorpes J.E. Mutt V. Magnusson S. Steele B.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). However, other types of post-translational modifications also exist in peptide hormones, including tyrosine sulfation of cholecystokinin (16Mutt V. Jorpes J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 6: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), serine phosphorylation of peptide YY (25Chen Z. Eriste E. Jonsson A.P. Norberg Å. Nepomuceno D. Lovenberg T.W. Bergman T.

We now describe, in isolation from porcine intestine, the structural and pharmacological characterizations of neurotensin post-translationally decorated with arginine (R-NT; N-(neurotensin-C5–4-yl)arginine)). We have shown that it has a potent biological activity. During this purification, two N-terminally truncated neurotensin forms, neurotensin-(2–13) and neurotensin-(3–13), both biologically active, were also isolated and characterized. Materials—Arg8-vasopressin (acetate salt), recombinant human insulin, and α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid were from Sigma. α-Cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid was recrystallized from ethanol/water and dissolved in 0.3% TFA/50% acetonitrile/water at 10 mg/ml. Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) (Roche Applied Science) was reconstituted in 30 mm citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 0.5 μg/μl and stored in 50-μl aliquots at –20 °C, thawed immediately before the experiments, and used within 1–2 days. R-NT was synthesized by NeoMPS (Strasbourg, France). Ca2+ Assay—SK-N-SH cells were plated onto 96-well black viewplates (Packard, CT) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with 4 μm Fluo-3 dye (Teflabs, Austin, TX), 0.04% pluronic F-127, 2.5 mm probenecid in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 without phenol red. Chromatographic fractions were lyophilized and dissolved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and plated onto 96-well V-bottom plates (Greiner, Longwood, FL). Several receptor ligands were used as positive and negative controls. From these plates, the solutions were removed by an automatic 96-tip pipette and added to the 96-well plates with Fluo-3-loaded cells. Fluorescence intensities were recorded during 2 min and plotted as a dependence of fluorescence intensity (%) versus time (2 min full scale). The ligand additions and intracellular Ca2+ measurements were carried out on a FLIPR (fluorometric imaging plate reader) instrument (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Purification of R-NT—The general procedure is shown by the flow-chart in Fig. 1. The starting material was obtained as a side fraction from the purification of secretin and its precursor forms (28Bonetto V. Jörnvall H. Mutt V. Sillard R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11985-11989Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) after chromatography on CM-cellulose (Whatman) with 22.5 mm sodium-phosphate (pH 6.4) and a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl. Fractions were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 Coarse column (Amersham Biosciences) using 0.2 m acetic acid and purified further on ÄKTA Explorer and Purifier HPLC systems (Amersham Biosciences). The lyophilized material from fractions 1 and 2 (in total 118 mg) was dissolved in 40 ml of sodium-acetate, pH 5.2, after which 26 ml was chromatographed on a Resource S 6-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) using a solvent system consisting of A (20 mm sodium-acetate, pH 5.2, containing 20% acetonitrile) and B (A + 2 m NaCl) with a gradient of 1–6% B in 35 column volumes (CV). Fractions of 4.5 ml were collected. Fractions 1–21 were pooled, diluted with water to 336 ml, adjusted to pH 2.5, and further chromatographed on the Resource column with a solvent system consisting of A at pH 2.5 and B with a gradient 4–23% B over 30 CV, with collection of 4.5-ml fractions. The material was purified further by three steps of reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 2). Fractions 12–15 were pooled, diluted with 2 volumes of water, and chromatographed on ODS-AP (10 × 100 mm, 5 μm) (YMC, Schermbeck, Germany) using a solvent system consisting of A, 0.1% TFA/water, and B, 0.1% TFA/water/95% acetonitrile, and a gradient of 14–42% B over 30 CV, with collection of 3.5-ml fractions. This chromatography was performed three times, and two active regions (fractions 19–20 plus fractions 22–23) were observed and further purified separately. Use of fractions 19 and 20 is given in the next section, whereas fractions 22 and 23 were pooled, diluted with water, and chromatographed on the Source 5RPC (ST 4.6/150, Amersham Biosciences) column with the solvent system as in the previous step. The gradient was 19–31% B in 15 CV, and 500-μl fractions were collected. Fraction 36 was diluted with water and chromatographed on μRPC C2/C18 (ST 4.6/100, Amersham Biosciences) using the same solvent system as in the previous step and a gradient of 20–30% B over 15 CV. Fraction 28 was subjected to structural analysis. Purification of Neurotensin-(2–13)—Fractions 19 and 20 from the YMC ODS-AP chromatography (Figs. 1 and 2), with the activity as described above, were pooled and diluted with water to 31 ml. The resulting solution was chromatographed on the Source 5RPC column using the same solvent system as above. A gradient of 17–32% B over 15 CV was employed, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Fraction 35 was diluted with 400 ml of water and chromatographed on Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 50 mm, 3 μm, 300 Å) using a solvent system consisting of A, 0.1% TFA/water, and B, 0.1% TFA/water/95% methanol. A gradient of 28–44% B over 30 CV was used, and 300-μl fractions were collected. Fraction 11 was subjected to structural analysis. Purification of Neurotensin-(3–13)—The starting material for this part was prepared as described previously (29Eriste E. Norberg Å. Bonetto V. Nepomuceno D. Lovenberg T.W. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The material (1.5 g) from the methanol extraction and precipitation at neutral pH (acidic methanol-soluble neutral insoluble fraction) (29Eriste E. Norberg Å. Bonetto V. Nepomuceno D. Lovenberg T.W. Sillard R. Jörnvall H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was dissolved in 500 ml of degassed water; the pH was adjusted to 5.2 with 2 m NaOH and passed through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter. The liquid was divided into 10 aliquots and applied onto the Resource S column. After equilibration with 6 CV of 20 mm sodium-acetate, pH 5.2, peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0–15% B (2 m NaCl in the same buffer) in 20 CV, and in total, 10 runs were performed. The activity was detected in fraction 12 and collected for the next step. The active fractions were diluted 10-fold with degassed water, and the pH was adjusted to 2.5. The sample was applied onto the same column and run with a solvent system of 20 mm sodium-phosphate, pH 2.5, 20% acetonitrile (eluent A). The peptides were eluted with a gradient of 9–23.5% B (2 m NaCl in the same buffer) over 30 CV. The active fractions 9–11 were pooled. These combined fractions were applied onto the YMC ODS-AP column. The solvents used were A, 0.1% TFA/water, and B, 0.1%TFA/95% acetonitrile/water. The peptides were eluted with a gradient of 20–40% B over 30 CV. The active fractions from 2 runs were pooled for the next step. The material was then diluted 2-fold with 0.1% TFA/water (eluent A) and applied onto the μRPC C2/C18 column. The solvent system was the same as in the previous step. Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 20–30% B over 15 CV. The active fractions 17–20 were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS), and fraction 17 was analyzed by Edman degradation for 20 cycles. The remaining material from fractions 17–20 after MALDI MS was pooled and purified further. The peptides were applied onto cation exchange Mini S PE 4.6/50 (4.6 × 50 mm, 3 μm, Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm acetate, pH 4.1, 20% acetonitrile (eluent A). Peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0–15% eluent B (2 m NaCl in the same buffer) over 25 CV. Activity was detectable in fractions 31–34. The most active fractions, 32 and 33, were pooled for the next purification step on a μRPC C2/C18, as described above, with the same solvent system. The material was eluted with a gradient 20–30% B in 15 CV. Fraction 13 was active. Mass Spectrometry and Sequence Analysis—MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE Pro instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples from the HPLC separations (0.7–1 μl in 0.1% TFA/water/acetonitrile) were mixed on a stainless steel MALDI plate with 0.7 μl of standard solution and 0.7 μl of matrix solution and allowed to dry at room temperature. A standard solution was prepared in 0.1% TFA/water yielding Arg8-vasopressin at 0.28 pmol/μl and human insulin at 18 pmol/μl. The spectra were calibrated using the values for monoisotopic singly charged ions of Arg8-vasopressin (m/z 1084.4457) and insulin (m/z 5804.6455). Accuracy of mass measurement was 0.05 Da. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight MS spectra were recorded on an Ettan electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Amersham Biosciences). Collision-induced dissociation spectra were recorded on a quadrupole-TOF tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a Z spray nano-electrospray interface (Waters/Micromass, Manchester, UK) as described previously (30Bonetto V. Eriste E. Jonsson A.P. Efendic S. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For C-terminal ladder sequence analysis (31Bonetto V. Bergman A.-C. Jörnvall H. Sillard R. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 1314-1319Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), samples from the HPLC separation (0.7–1 μl) were mixed on a MALDI plate with 0.7 μlof CPY solution and allowed to dry at room temperature. 0.7 μl of standard solution and 0.7 μl of matrix solution was added to the same spot and allowed to dry again at room temperature. N-terminal sequence analysis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Procise HT sequencer. Accurate measurements of mass were carried out on a Finnigan LTQ-FT (Thermo Electron GmbH, Bremen, Germany) instrument. The LTQ-FT is a hybrid instrument and consists of two mass analyzers, a linear ion trap, and a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance cell. The linear ion trap is characterized by high scan rates also in the MS/MS mode of operation. The Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance analyzer routinely achieves a mass resolution of r = 100.000 at m/z 400 with a scan rate of 1 scan/s, while providing mass measurement accuracies <2 parts/million utilizing external calibration. Detection of mRNA Expression of Neurotensin Receptors in the Human Cell Line SK-N-SH—Total RNA from SK-N-SH cells was treated with DNase I (Epicenter Technologies) to remove genomic DNA. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 100 ng of oligo(dT)18–21 (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min and then heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 3 min and chilled on ice. The cDNA was diluted 20-fold, and 2 μl of sample was analyzed by quantitative PCR using the SmartCycler (Cepheid) in duplicates. The PCR mix consisted of 0.2× Sybr Green I (Invitrogen), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 unit of TaqStart antibody (BD Biosciences), 3 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Veridex), 200 mm trehalose (Sigma), and 200 μm dNTPs (Amersham Biosciences). PCR primers were from GenBase (San Diego, CA). PCR cycle parameters were: initial hold at 95 °C for 90 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, 62 °C for 7 s, and 72 °C for 12 s. At the end, a melt curve analysis was done. PCR products were also analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. The primer sequences were: NTR1, 5′-CTG GAT GAG ACT GTC CTG GA-3′ and 5′-TCA ACG GGA AAG CCG ACT TC-3′; NTR2, 5′-AGC CAG GGC GAC TTC TAT CA-3′ and 5′-CGC ACC AGG TTC TGT GCT AA-3′; and sortilin 1, 5′-AGG AAG GGA TTC GGC TTT CA-3′ and 5′-CCC ATG GCA GAC AGA ACA GA-3′. Molecular Cloning of Human NTR1, NTR2, and NTR3—The human NTR1 complete coding region was amplified by PCR using forward primer (5′-TCT CGC TAG CGC CAC CAT GCG CCT CAA CAG CTC CGC GCC GGG AAC CCC GGG CAC GC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ACT AGA GCG GCC GCC TAG TAC AGC GTC TCG CGG GTG GCA TTG-3′) and human brain cDNA pool (BD Biosciences) as the template. Human NTR2 cDNA was PCR-amplified from the human brain cDNA pool using two primers (forward primer 5′-ACG GAA TTC GCC ACC ATG GAA ACC AGC AGC CCG CG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ACG AGT GCG GCC GCT CAG GTC CGG GTT TCT GGG GGA TCC-3′). Similarly, the human NTR3 extracellular domain (amino acids 1–756) coding region was amplified using forward primer 5′-ATA GAA CTC GAG GCC ACC ATG GAG CGG CCC TGG GGA GCT GCG GA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCT CTA TCT AGA TTA CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC AGA ATT TGA CTT GGA ATT CTG TTT TTC CGG A-3′. NTR1, -2, and -3 extracellular domain coding regions were then cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. All DNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the sequence identities. Characterization of Neurotensin Receptors Using Radioligand Binding Assays—For NTR1 and NTR2, the binding assays were performed as described previously (32Liu C. Chen J. Sutton S. Roland B. Kuei C. Farmer N. Sillard R. Lovenberg T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50765-50770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with the membranes, radioligand, and unlabeled ligands as described below. NTR1- and NTR2-expressing DNA constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine as the transfection reagent. Two days after transfection, the cell membranes were prepared and used for 125IY0-neurotensin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) binding assays in the presence of different concentrations of neurotensin or R-NT as the competitors. The final concentration used for NTR1 and NTR2 binding assays is 30 pm. For NTR3, which was expressed as a soluble form with a FLAG tag at the C terminus, was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Three days after transfection, the conditioned medium was collected, and the soluble NTR3/125IY0-neurotensin binding was performed similarly as described previously (49Liu C. Liu X.J. Barry G. Ling N. Maki R.A. DeSouza E.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3548-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, the conditioned media, either from mock or NTR3 cDNA-transfected cells, were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove the cell debris. The clear supernatants were aliquoted in 1.5-ml tubes at 1 ml/tube; 125IY0-neurotensin was added to each tube at a final concentration of 30 pm. Different concentrations of neurotensin or R-NT were added to the tubes, respectively, as the competitors. 20 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) was added to each tube to capture the NTR3-FLAG-soluble receptor. The tubes were incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight. The NTR3-FLAG-soluble receptor with the bound 125IY0-neurotensin complex, which was captured by anti-FLAG beads, was precipitated by centrifugation. The supernatants, which contain the unbound ligand, were aspirated, and the pellets, containing the bound radioligand, were counted in a γ counter (Quantum Cobra, Packard Instrument). Functional Characterization of NT1 and NT2 Receptors—Recombinant NTR1- and NTR2-expressing DNA constructs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells either alone or in co-expression with Gα16 (33Amatruda III, T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine as the transfection reagent. Two days after transfection, cells were detached from the cell culture plates using phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm of EDTA and then seeded in 96-well black well poly-d-lysine-coated tissue culture plates as described above. After Ca2+ dye Fluo-3 was loaded to the cells, different concentrations of neurotensin or R-NT were used to stimulate the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, which was monitored using a FLIPR instrument. Characterization of Post-translationally Modified Neurotensin—Purification was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The peptide from fraction 28 of the μRPC step, which eluted at 19 ml, was active in the Ca2+ release assay. Initially, the peptide was analyzed by MALDI-TOF and electrospray ionization time-of-flight MS, which gave an m/z of 1829.04, indicating a 156.1 Da higher mass than that of intact neurotensin. N-terminal sequence analysis was attempted several times without result, indicating that it was N-terminally blocked. The peptide was then subjected to C-terminal ladder sequence analysis with CPY-producing fragments at m/z 1602.86, 1715.96, and 1829.01, which gave mass values 113.10 and 113.05 Da for the two C-terminal residues, consistent with Leu/Ile for the last two residues. Further digestion with higher concentrations of CPY revealed an additional amino acid with 163.05 Da, consistent with Tyr (163.06 Da). Thus, the three-residue C-terminal sequence is Y(I/L)(I/L), and is in accordance with the neurotensin structure. The peptide was digested on the MALDI target with trypsin, after which analysis by MALDI-TOF MS showed two values of m/z 1186.65 and 661.43. The latter value is in good agreement with the theoretical mass value of the C-terminal neurotensin fragment RPYIL (calculated value, 661.40), but the former"
https://openalex.org/W2012600562,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and is associated with several human malignancies. The EBV protein latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) promotes viral latency in memory B cells by interfering with B cell receptor signaling and provides a survival signal for mature B cells that have lost expression of surface immunoglobulin. The latter function has suggested that LMP2A may enhance the survival of EBV-positive tumors. EBV is associated with several T cell malignancies and, since LMP2A has been detected in several of these disorders, we examined the ability of LMP2A to transmit signals and interfere with T cell receptor signaling in T cells. We show that LMP2A is tyrosine-phosphorylated in Jurkat TAg T cells, which requires expression of the Src family tyrosine kinases, Lck and Fyn. Lck and Fyn are recruited to the tyrosine-phosphorylated Tyr112 site in LMP2A, whereas phosphorylation of an ITAM motif in LMP2A creates a binding site for the ZAP-70/Syk tyrosine kinases. LMP2A also associates through its two PPPPY motifs with AIP4, a NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligase; this interaction results in ubiquitylation of LMP2A and serves to regulate the stability of LMP2A and LMP2A-kinase complexes. Furthermore, stable expression of LMP2A in Jurkat T cells down-regulated T cell receptor levels and attenuated T cell receptor signaling. Thus, through recruiting tyrosine kinases involved in T cell receptor activation, LMP2A may provide a survival signal for EBV-positive T cell tumors, whereas LMP2A-associated NEDD4 E3 ligases probably titer the strength of this signal.

Infection is common, and it is estimated that ∼90% of the world's population is latently infected with EBV (3Henle G. Henle W. Clifford P. Diehl V. Kafuko G.W. Kirya B.G. Klein G. Morrow R.H. Munube G.M. Pike P. Tukei P.M. Ziegler J.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1969; 43: 1147-1157PubMed Google Scholar). This latent infection is maintained in the body's memory B cells through the expression of a number of latency-associated viral genes, one of which is latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) (4Miller C.L.

It has been reported to aggregate into “cap-like” structures at the plasma membrane (5Longnecker R. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2319-2326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Longnecker R. Druker B.

Virol. 2001; 75: 10941-10949Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).LMP2A is thought to maintain B cells in the latent state by interfering with signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR) and thus prevent activation of the lytic promoting viral BZLF-1 gene (4Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Longnecker R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 12Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Longnecker R. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of LMP2A to interfere with BCR signaling and maintain viral latency is due to a number of protein-protein interaction motifs located within the amino-terminal tail (see Fig. 1). These include a YEEA site that, when phosphorylated on the tyrosine residue (Tyr112), can bind the Src homology 2 domain of the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn (12Miller C.L. Lee J.H. Kieff E. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Longnecker R. Infect. Agents Dis. 1994; 3: 128-136PubMed Google Scholar, 13Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Kieff E. Longnecker R. J.

In addition, LMP2A possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) motif with the consensus sequence YXX(I/V)X6-8-YXX(I/V), which is found in a number of immunoreceptors including the BCR, the T cell receptor (TCR), and the Fcϵ receptor that binds IgE (15Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). This motif in LMP2A, when phosphorylated on tyrosines 74 and 85, provides a binding site for the dual Src homology 2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Syk (16Fruehling S. Longnecker R. Virology. 1997; 235: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 17Miller C.L. Burkhardt A.L. Lee J.H. Stealey B. Longnecker R. Bolen J.B. Kieff E. Immunity. 1995; 2: 155-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). LMP2A also possesses two PPPPY (PY) motifs that can bind to the WW domains of the NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, including AIP4, NEDD4-2, and WWP2 (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Ikeda M. Ikeda A. Longan L.C. Longnecker R.

Binding to NEDD4 proteins is abrogated by mutation of both tyrosines in the PY motifs (Tyr60 and Tyr101). NEDD4 family proteins contain HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus) domains that catalyze the ubiquitylation of proteins such as those associated with the WW domains and target them for degradation via either the 26 S proteasome or a lysosomal pathway (21Ingham R.J. Gish G. Pawson T. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1972-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). LMP2A and the LMP2A-associated kinases are substrates for the NEDD4 family of proteins, suggesting that LMP2A may not only sequester tyrosine kinases away from the BCR but may also direct them to ubiquitin-mediated pathways such as degradation.Somewhat paradoxically, LMP2A has also been shown to mimic BCR signaling. When expressed as a transgene specifically in the B-lineage in mice, LMP2A can both drive B cell development and promote the survival of mature B cells in the absence of surface Ig expression (22Caldwell R.G. Wilson J.B. Anderson S.J. Longnecker R. Immunity. 1998; 9: 405-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 23Caldwell R.G. Brown R.C. Longnecker R. J.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this signal appears to be attenuated by the NEDD4 family protein, Itch, since crossing mice homozygous for a deficiency in Itch into the LMP2A transgenic background enhanced LMP2A-mediated signaling (25Ikeda A. Caldwell R.G. Longnecker R. Ikeda M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5529-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, LMP2A may provide a survival factor for EBV-positive B cell tumors that have lost expression of surface Ig as well as preventing virus reactivation.EBV can also infect T cells and is found associated with a wide range of peripheral T cell and NK-/T-cell lymphomas, particularly localized to the upper respiratory tract (26Hamilton-Dutoit S.J. Pallesen G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1315-1325PubMed Google Scholar, 27Van Gorp J. De Bruin P.C. Sie-Go D.M. Van Heerde P. Ossenkoppele G.J. Rademakers L.H. Meijer C.J. Van Den Tweel J.G. Histopathology. 1995; 27: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These lymphomas are particularly prevalent in Southeast Asia, overlapping with the high incidence region for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (28Peh S.C. Sandvej K. Pallesen G. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). EBV-positive T cell malignancies are also associated with Japanese patients with chronic active EBV infection and EBV-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (29Kanegane H. Nomura K. Miyawaki T. Tosato G. Ohga S. Nomura A. Takada H. Hara T. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 44: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Wakiguchi H. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

In these potentially fatal disorders, EBV-infected T cells produce large numbers of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α that cause fever, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, with patients often succumbing to hepatic or cardiac problems. Whereas LMP1 has been suggested to regulate cytokine production in these EBV-infected T cells (33Lay J.D. Chuang S.E. Rowe M. Su I.J. J. Biomed. Sci. 2003; 10: 146-155PubMed Google Scholar), they also express LMP2A (34Imai S. Sugiura M. Oikawa O. Koizumi S. Hirao M. Kimura H. Hayashibara H. Terai N. Tsutsumi H. Oda T. Chiba S. Osato T. Blood. 1996; 87: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the function of LMP2A in these and other T cell malignancies (35van Gorp J. Brink A. Oudejans J.J. van den Brule A.J. van den Tweel J.G. Jiwa N.M. de Bruin P.C. Meijer C.J. J. Clin. Pathol. 1996; 49: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has not been established. In this regard, the similarities between BCR and TCR signaling raise the possibility that LMP2A may be able to manipulate TCR signaling as it does BCR signaling. We have therefore, examined the potential functions of LMP2A in T cells. Here we show that in the Jurkat T antigen (TAg) human T cell line, LMP2A is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associates with the tyrosine kinases Lck and ZAP-70 through the phosphorylated YEEA and ITAM motifs, respectively. Also, the two PY motifs in LMP2A bind the NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 in T cells, which can consequently ubiquitylate LMP2A. Mutation of the PY motifs in LMP2A greatly stabilizes the protein and increases the stability of LMP2A-kinase complexes. This may have the consequence of titering signaling through LMP2A. In this model system, stable expression of LMP2A down-regulated TCR levels and moderately inhibited signaling events downstream of the TCR. Our demonstration that LMP2A interacts with key T cell signaling proteins suggests a role for this viral protein in EBV-positive T cell tumors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies, Constructs, and Other Reagents—The M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (mAb) and anti-α-tubulin mAb, DM 1A, were purchased from Sigma. The anti-LMP2A rat mAb, 14B7, was purchased from ITN GmbH (Neuherberg, Germany). The anti-Lck, anti-Fyn, anti-Syk polyclonal, and anti-ZAP-70 antisera were provided by Dr André Veillette (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). The anti-AIP4 polyclonal antiserum has been previously described (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

The phosphospecific anti-phospho-Erk (Thr202, Tyr204) and phospho-ZAP-70 (Tyr319) antisera were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). The phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CDϵ (UCHT1), anti-CD69 (H1.2F3), anti-CD28 (CD28.2), and isotype control mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences (Mississauga, Canada).The Myc-tagged murine ZAP-70 was provided by Dr. Andrey Shaw (Washington University, St Louis, MO). The HA-ubiquitin construct was a gift from Dr. Ivan Dikic (Goethe University Medical School, Frankfurt, Germany). The mutant LMP2A constructs (see Fig. 1) have either been previously described (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or were generated by PCR and sequence-verified. The 4× FLAG constructs were generated by cloning singly FLAG-tagged LMP2A constructs into the pCMV 3× FLAG vector (Sigma). The resulting proteins consist of three FLAG epitopes, a spacer of 14 amino acids, an additional FLAG epitope, and a spacer of 6 amino acids, followed by the LMP2A protein. The doubly Myc-tagged AIP4 constructs were generated by PCR of our previously published constructs (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with the amino terminus of the published AIP4 sequence (19Ikeda M. Ikeda A. Longan L.C. Longnecker R. Virology. 2000; 268: 178-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) replacing the amino-terminal Itch portion of the fusion used in our earlier study. These constructs were cloned into the pCDNA3.1A expression vector (Invitrogen). The synthesis of the biotinylated peptides has been previously described (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) with peptide sequences indicated in Fig. 1.Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—Jurkat, Jurkat TAg, and the Syk/ZAP-70-deficient (P116) T cells were obtained from Dr. André Veillette. The JCAM-1 cells (Lck-deficient) and JCAM-1 cells reconstituted with Lck were a gift from Dr. David Strauss (Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). The stable LMP2A-expressing Jurkat cell lines were generated using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer using the pLXPOP vector containing the LMP2A cDNA (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the primate-tropic packaging line, PG13 (36Miller A.D. Garcia J.V. von Suhr N. Lynch C.M. Wilson C. Eiden M.V. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2220-2224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stably expressing cells were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin, and LMP2A expression was verified by anti-LMP2A immunoblotting.Transfection of Jurkat and Jurkat-derivative Cell Lines—Jurkat or derivative cell lines were electroporated with a BTX ECM 830 square wave electroporator (BTX, San Diego, CA) with three 225-V pulses of 8-ms pulse length and waiting for 1 s between pulses. The total amount of DNA electroporated in each experiment, indicated in the figures and figure legends, was kept constant through the addition of empty vector. After electroporation, cells were resuspended in fresh RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.Cell Lysis and Precipitations—Cells were collected by centrifugation at ∼500 × g at 24 h post-electroporation and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min on a rocker in the cold. Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation of the lysate at ∼18,000 × g for 10 min. Cleared lysates were incubated with 2-4 μg of the indicated antibodies and either protein A- or G-Sepharose or anti-mouse Ig agarose for 1 h on a rocker at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For precipitations with the biotinylated peptides, 10 μl of peptide-saturated streptavidin-agarose beads, corresponding to ∼1 nmol of peptide, was used. Dephosphorylation of the tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides was achieved by incubating the peptides on streptavidin-agarose with 1 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to performing precipitation experiments.Western Blotting—Samples were run out on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blocked in 5% skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST. Blots were incubated with primary Ab in TBST with 5% bovine serum albumin either overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then rinsed several times in TBST followed by incubation with a secondary Ab, either goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, or protein A-horseradish peroxidase-coupled reagent (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were rinsed several times in TBST and, finally, rinsed once in TBS before being exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). Blots were stripped with TBST, pH 2, for 30 min before being reprobed as above.Cycloheximide and Ubiquitylation Experiments—For cycloheximide experiments, Jurkat TAg cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then either left untreated or treated for the indicated times with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) prior to lysing the cells as described above. For ubiquitylation experiments, transfected cells were grown for 24 h and then treated for 1 h with 50 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (BACHEM, King of Prussia, PA). Cells were then lysed as described above with the exception that 50 μm MG132 and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) was added to the lysis buffer.Stimulation of Jurkat T Cells—Jurkat T cells were resuspended to 1 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 medium. 1 ml of the cell suspension was incubated with the anti-TCR CD3ϵ chain mAb, OKT3, anti-CD28 mAb (a gift from Dr. Philippe Poussier, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada), or both at 10 μg/ml for 30 min on ice with occasional mixing. The cells were then pelleted and rinsed with serum-free RPMI. Cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of fresh RPMI 1640 medium (no serum) containing 20 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Can, Mississauga, Canada) for the indicated times at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cells were then spun down and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as described above, and the protein concentration of the cleared lysate was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce).Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—1 × 106 cells were pelleted and washed in FACS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% serum and 0.02% NaN3). Cells were resuspended in 50 μl of FACS buffer to which 20 μl of PE-conjugated Ab was added. Cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with occasional mixing and washed a final time with FACS buffer before being resuspended in 1 ml of FACS buffer and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur cell sorter. For stimulation of cells prior to sorting, 5 × 105 cells were incubated for 24 h with 2 μg of the anti-CD3 mAb (UCHT1) or 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in 24-well plates.RESULTSExpression of LMP2A and LMP2A Mutant Constructs in Jurkat TAg Cells—To explore if LMP2A is tyrosine-phosphorylated in T cells, associates with T cell tyrosine kinases, and affects TCR signaling, we expressed wild type (WT) LMP2A containing a quadruple FLAG tag at the amino terminus (4× FLAG-LMP2A) in Jurkat TAg cells (Fig. 2). In addition, we constructed mutants in the 4× FLAG background that lack the putative binding sites for Src family tyrosine kinases (Y112F; SFK-), the tandem Src homology 2 domains of the Syk/ZAP-70 tyrosine kinases (Y74/85F; ITAM-), or the WW domains of NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases (Y60/101A; PY-) (see Fig. 1). To first assess the relative expression level of the different 4× FLAG-tagged LMP2A proteins, expression vectors encoding WT or mutant LMP2A were electroporated into Jurkat TAg cells, and expression was assessed 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The expression level of the PY- mutant with substitutions in both PPPPY motifs was consistently severalfold higher than either WT LMP2A or any of the other mutant proteins (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Titering the amount of transfected cDNA for the WT and PY- mutant showed that the mutant was expressed at 5-10 times the level of the WT protein (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Furthermore, incorporating substitutions in either the SFK (Y112F) binding site or the ITAM (Y74/85F) motif into the PY- mutant background (4× FLAG-PY-/SFK- LMP2A and 4× FLAG-PY-/ITAM- LMP2A, respectively) significantly increased the expression levels of both the SFK- and ITAM- mutants (Fig. 2C, upper panel). To determine whether the increased level of the PY- mutant was due to stabilization of the LMP2A protein, we treated Jurkat TAg cells with cycloheximide and compared the stability of the WT and PY- mutant proteins. The WT protein showed a significant decrease in expression over time in the cycloheximide-treated samples that was attenuated with the PY- mutant (Fig. 2D). This was especially evident at the 12-h time point. Taken together, these data suggest a role for the PY motifs in controlling the stability of LMP2A in Jurkat TAg cells.FIGURE 2The PY- mutant is stabilized in Jurkat TAg cells. A, Jurkat TAg cells were electroporated with 50 μg of the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared and expression of the 4× FLAG-tagged constructs visualized by Western blotting with the M2 anti-FLAG mAb (upper panel). The blot was subsequently stripped and reprobed with an anti-α-tubulin antibody to show equal loading (lower panel). B, Jurkat TAg cells were transfected with the plasmids at the indicated amounts and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoblotted as in A. C, Jurkat TAg cells were electroporated with 50 μg of the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells lysates were immunoblotted as in A. D, Jurkat TAg cells were transfected with 50μg of the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were then either left untreated (-) or treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (+) for the indicated times prior to lysis and blotting the lysates as in A. Molecular mass standards (in kDa) are indicated on the left of each blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LMP2A Associates with the NEDD4 Family Protein, AIP4, and Is Ubiquitylated in Jurkat TAg Cells—Since mutation of the PY motifs within LMP2A has previously been shown to abolish interaction with the NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases in B cells (18Winberg G. Matskova L. Chen F. Plant P. Rotin D. Gish G. Ingham R. Ernberg I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8526-8535Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 20Ikeda M. Ikeda A. Longnecker R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5711-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the increased abundance and stability of this mutant protein in Jurkat TAg T cells may reflect an inability to bind NEDD4 family proteins and consequently a defect in ubiquitylation and degradation. We therefore tested whether WT LMP2A associates with the NEDD4 family member AIP4 in Jurkat TAg cells. Fig. 3A shows that endogenous AIP4 co-precipitates with WT LMP2A (4× FLAG-LMP2A) and with the putative Src family kinase (4× FLAG-SFK- LMP2A) and ITAM (4× FLAG-ITAM- LMP2A) mutants, but not with the PY- mutant (4× FLAG-PY- LMP2A) in Jurkat TAg cells. Thus, LMP2A associates with NEDD4 family proteins through its PY motifs in Jurkat T cells, and the inability to bind this family of proteins correlates with an increase in LMP2A stability. We therefore next tested whether LMP2A was ubiquitylated in Jurkat TAg cells. Co-transfection of Jurkat TAg cells with FLAG-tagged LMP2A and an HA-tagged ubiquitin construct showed that the HA-tagged ubiquitin was incorporated into LMP2A, with species probably corresponding to mono-, di-, and tri-ubiquitylated LMP2A predominating (Fig. 3B, upper panel; indicated with arrows). Co-transfection of a Myc-tagged AIP4 construct enhanced LMP2A ubiquitylation, whereas co-transfecting a Myc-tagged mutant AIP4 protein that had been rendered enzymatically inactive by mutation of the catalytic cysteine (Myc-C830A AIP4) did not augment (and in most experiments slightly inhibited) the ubiquitylation of LMP2A in Jurkat TAg cells. Since we could readily identify ubiquitylation of LMP2A in Jurkat TAg cells, we tested whether the PY- LMP2A mutant was detectably ubiquitylated. cDNAs encoding the 4× FLAG-LMP2A or 4× FLAG-PY- LMP2A were co-transfected with the HA-tagged ubiquitin into Jurkat TAg cells. To equalize for protein expression, one-fifth the amount of the cDNA was transfected for the PY- mutant. The results show that in contrast to the WT protein, the PY- LMP2A mutant that lacks binding sites for the WW domains of AIP4 was not appreciably ubiquitylated in these cells (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Therefore, LMP2A is ubiquitylated by NEDD4 family E3 protein-ubiquitin ligases in Jurkat TAg cells, and the lack of ubiquitylation of the PY- mutant probably explains the increased stability of this protein.FIGURE 3LMP2A associates with the NEDD4 family protein, AIP4, and is ubiquitylated in Jurkat TAg cells. A, Jurkat TAg cells were transfected with 25 μg of the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the M2 anti-FLAG mAb, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-AIP4 polyclonal antiserum (upper panel). The blot was then stripped and reprobed with the M2 anti-FLAG mAb (lower panel). B, Jurkat TAg cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 50 μm MG132 1 h prior to lysis and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 μm MG132 and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the 14B7 anti-LMP2A rat mAb, and precipitated proteins were analyzed for ubiquitylated proteins by immunoblotting with an anti-HA polyclonal antiserum (upper panel).

At the NH2 terminus, two different promoters generate the full-length and the ΔN isoforms, with or without the transactivating domain. At the COOH terminus, seven isoforms generated through alternative splicing have been cloned. Previous studies have demonstrated that ΔNp73 isoforms exert a dominant-negative effect on p73 by blocking their transactivation activity and hence the ability to induce apoptosis. Considerable efforts are made to identify the functional diversity of the COOH-terminal p73 variants. In this study, we found that p73α inhibited drug-induced apoptosis in small cell lung carcinoma cells, whereas p73β promoted it. p73α prevented Bax activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase activation. In addition, p73α was also able to reduce apoptosis induced by the BH3-only protein PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis). Furthermore, we discovered that p73α is able to inhibit the pro-apoptotic effect of p73β, demonstrating the existence of equilibrium between these two p73 isoforms. In conclusion, the reported overexpression of p73α in certain tumor types, and our findings that p73α exerts anti-apoptotic functions, indicate a potential oncogenic activity for p73.

It can substitute for p53 when the latter is deleted or mutated. p73 has a high sequence homology with p53 within the amino-terminal transactivation domain (TA), 2The abbreviations used are: TA, transactivation domain; AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; DBD, DNA binding domain; ΔΨm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; SCLC, small cell lung carcinoma; STS, staurosporine; OD, oligomerization domain; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PUMA, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis; VP16, vepeside, etoposide; SAM, sterile α motif; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester.2The abbreviations used are: TA, transactivation domain; AIF, apoptosis inducing factor; DBD, DNA binding domain; ΔΨm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; SCLC, small cell lung carcinoma; STS, staurosporine; OD, oligomerization domain; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PUMA, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis; VP16, vepeside, etoposide; SAM, sterile α motif; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. the sequence specific DNA-binding region (DBD), and the oligomerization domain (OD). In fact, like p53, p73 induces cell growth arrest (1Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 1997; 389: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 6Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A.

However, despite similarities with p53, it is clear that p73 presents significant differences in terms of regulation and function. In contrast to p53-deficient mice, the p73-null mice show no increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis (8Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4021) Google Scholar). On the other hand, they exhibit profound developmental defects, including dysgenesis in the brain (9Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In contrast to the human p53 gene, which is found to encode one protein, the human p73 gene gives rise to 14 isoforms by both alternative splicing and by the use of alternative promoters (p73(α-η) and ΔNp73(α-η)) (7Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The isoforms generated by two promoters are called p73 and ΔNp73, the former contains a TA domain and the latter has a shorter amino terminus without the TA domain. In addition, alternative splicing generates at least seven transcripts with different carboxyl termini (α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, and η). p73α is the longest form of the p73 proteins, and contains in its carboxyl-terminal extension a sterile α motif (SAM) domain. p73β is a smaller polypeptide, missing the extreme carboxyl-terminal region and most of the SAM domain present in p73α (6Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Of all the p73 isoforms, p73β seems to be the most potent in transactivation and growth suppression. p73α, p73δ, and p73η are less active than p73β, whereas p73γ and p73ϵ are ineffective in this respect (11De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 12De Laurenzi V.D.

Whereas p73 isoforms function as transcription factors that might induce cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, the ΔNp73 isoforms that lack the TA domain are incapable of activating transcription and do not induce growth arrest or cell death. However, the ΔNp73 variants have a very important regulatory role, as they exert a dominant-negative effect on p53 and p73 by blocking their transactivation activity, and hence their ability to induce apoptosis (13Ishimoto O. Kawahara C. Enjo K. Obinata M. Nukiwa T. Ikawa S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 636-641PubMed Google Scholar). This scenario suggests that the p73 gene exemplifies the “two genes in one” idea with products that play opposite roles. Their impact on cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death might therefore depend on the balance between “pro” p73 isoforms and the “anti” ΔNp73 isoforms. p73α, which is most abundantly expressed in many tissues and cells among the alternatively spliced forms of p73, has an additional long carboxyl-terminal tail that might explain the distinct function of p53 and p73α or other p73 splicing variants. The SAM domain is found in p73-related proteins, and in several unrelated proteins that are involved in the regulation of development (10Chi S.W. Ayed A. Arrowsmith C.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4438-4445Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In some signaling proteins, the SAM domain is involved in protein-protein interactions. However, it is not clear whether the SAM domain in p73α has similar activity. A current idea is that the diverse functions of p73 in controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, might be because of the different ability of its isoforms to regulate these processes. In the attempt of delineating the functions of the different p73 isoforms, we found that, in the small cell lung carcinoma cells (SCLC), p73α inhibits drug-induced apoptotic cell death. On the contrary, p73β enhances that process. The observed inhibitory effect is dependent on the carboxyl terminus region of p73α containing the SAM domain and required the DNA binding domain. The inhibition of cell death occurs upstream of caspase activation and mitochondrial events, such as cytochrome c release, suggesting that p73α acts at the initiation phase of apoptosis and has a rather broad range inhibitory effect preventing the caspase- and mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways. Furthermore, we observed that p73α is able to inhibit the pro-apoptotic effect of p73β and, inversely, that p73β could counteract the anti-apoptotic function of p73α, demonstrating an equilibrium between these two isoforms. In addition to the previously described antagonistic effect of ΔNp73 on the p73 isoforms, our finding of the existence of pro- and anti-apoptotic members within the p73 variants reveal the complexity of the outcome of p73 gene expression. Reagents—Etoposide (VP16) and cisplatin were both from Bristol-Myers. Staurosporine (STS) and MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos were purchased from Sigma and Molecular Probes, respectively.

Protein expression level and subcellular localization of each p73 variant used in these studies was examined. No significant difference in their expression at the protein level was noticed. In addition, their localization was found to be mainly nuclear (Figs. 2 and 4, and data not shown).FIGURE 4p73α prevents caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in H82 cells.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium (NCI-H82 and U1285) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (H1299 and Saos-2), both supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Twenty-four hours after setting in culture dishes with fresh medium, cells were transfected. Transfections were performed in 24-well plates with Lipofectamine PLUS for Saos-2 and H1299 cells or with Lipofectamine 2000 for H82 and U1285 cells, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were treated with 5 μm VP16, 1 μm STS, or 40 μm cisplatin. The cell density was kept at levels allowing exponential growth. Western Blot Analysis—Laemmli's loading buffer (100 μl/106 cells) was added to harvested cells and samples were boiled for 3 min. Thirty μl of protein extracts were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were then probed with a monoclonal antibody anti-p73α/β (Ab-4; NeoMarker) or monoclonal antibody anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoblot with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase rabbit polyclonal antibody (Trevigen) was used for standardization of protein loading. Primary antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgGs (Pierce). After repeated washing in phosphate-buffered saline bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus) following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—At the indicated time points post-treatment, 15 × 104 H82 cells were harvested, and cytospins were prepared. Slides were stored at -20 °C and thawed for 1 h prior to staining. The following antibodies were used in these studies: monoclonal anti-p73α/β (Ab-4 (clones ER-13 + ER-15 + GC-15), NeoMarker), polyclonal anti-p73α/β (Chemicon), polyclonal anti-AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-active Bax (clone 6A7, BD Pharmingen), polyclonal anti-cleaved (Asp175) caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (clone 6H2-B4; BD Pharmingen), polyclonal anti-cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling), and polyclonal anti-PUMA (Cell Signaling). Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated anti-IgG were used as secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells and sections were blocked in HEPES, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton and incubated with primary (4 °C, overnight) and secondary antibodies (room temperature, 1 h). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). Samples were mounted with 90% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed under Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with an inverted Leica DM IFBE microscope with an ×63 oil immersion objective. Mix dyes were acquired by sequential multiple channel fluorescence scanning to avoid bleedthrough. Routinely, 0.15-0.20-μm thick focal planes were scanned. Assessment of Mitochondrial Depolarization—After treatment at the indicated time points, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was determined using MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos (Molecular Probes), a cationic, lipophilic fluorochrome dye that is retained in the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix but is lost if the mitochondrial inner membrane potential is lost. Staining was done following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min under growing conditions with 200 nm MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos. Cells were washed in growth medium, and fixed in the same medium containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. After fixation, cytospin preparations were made and immunofluorescence assay for p73 was performed as described above. Cytofluorometric analysis of mitochondrial membrane depolarization was assessed by uptake of TMRE (Molecular Probes), a lipophilic, cationic fluorochrome dye that is only taken up by mitochondria having an intact electrochemical gradient. Following TMRE exposure (added 30 min before harvesting to a final concentration of 25 nm), cells were centrifuged and resuspended in a TMRE-containing buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 25 nm TMRE). Analysis was carried out on 10,000 gated EGFP-expressing cells using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer equipped with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Flow Cytometric Analysis of Bax Activation—Bax-associated conformational changes were assessed as previously described (17Viktorsson K. Ekedahl J. Lindebro M.C. Lewensohn R. Zhivotovsky B. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation (0.25% paraformaldehyde, 5 min) and washing, cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of digitonin (100 μg/ml) with antibodies recognizing NH2-terminal epitopes of Bax (clone 6A7; BD Pharmingen). After incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 30 min, cells (10,000 per sample) were analyzed on a FACS-Calibur flow cytometer, using Cell Quest software. Caspase Activity Assay—Activities of caspase-3-like enzymes and caspase-9 were determined fluorometrically using DEVD-AMC and LEHD-AMC, respectively, as substrates in a buffer containing 100 mm HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10-6% Nonidet P-40, and 10% sucrose (DEVD-AMC) or 10% polyethylene glycol (LEHD-AMC), as previously described (18Joseph B. Marchetti P. Formstecher P. Kroemer G. Lewensohn R. Zhivotovsky B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed by following the Upstate Biotechnology ChIP assay kit protocol. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-p73 antibody clone Ab4 (NeoMarker). PCR amplification of the proximal PUMA promoter region spanning the two putative p53 response elements was performed using the following primers: 5′-CTGTGGCCTTGTGTCTGTGAGTAC-3′ and 5′-CCTAGCCCAAGGCAAGGAGGAC-3′ at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. Five ng of extracted DNA and 30 rounds of amplification were used. Reporter Gene Assays—Transfections were performed in 24-well plates with Lipofectamine 2000, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each well was transfected with 100 ng of reporter plasmid, 300 ng of expression vector, and 100 ng of pCMX-βgal reference plasmid containing a bacterial β-galactosidase gene. Additions to each well were adjusted to contain constant amounts of DNA and pCMX expression vector. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and lysed, and extracts were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in a microplate luminometer/photometer reader (Orion Microplate Luminometer; Berthold detection systems). Values shown are average of triplicates, with error bars representing S.D. p73α Expression Inhibits Drug-induced Apoptosis in SCLC Cells—At present, at least seven alternatively spliced p73 mRNAs named α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, and η have been identified. However, at the protein level α and β variants are the most abundant (for review see Ref. 7Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of these two most expressed p73 isoforms to modulate apoptotic cell death we used a panel of cell lines, namely, SCLC H82 and U1285, non-SCLC H1299, and osteocarcinoma Saos2. H82, U1285, H1299, and Saos2 are p53-null cells, and do not show detectable levels of p73 (Refs. 19Sirzen F. Nilsson A. Zhivotovsky B. Lewensohn R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 111-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 20Khan Q.A. Anderson L.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 173: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, and data not shown). These cells are therefore a convenient experimental model for evaluation of induction of apoptosis by p73. The different cell lines were transiently transfected with expression vector for p73α, p73β, and ΔNp73α. H82, U1285, and H1299 cells were then treated for 24 h with etoposide (VP16), and Saos2 cells (insensitive to VP16 treatment) for 4 h with STS. Full-length p73 isoforms induced apoptosis, and potentiated drug-induced cell death in H1299 and Saos2 cells. On the contrary, ΔNp73α reduced both spontaneous and drug-induced cell death in these cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Similar effects were observed with embryonic kidney 293 and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown). p73α, p73β, and ΔNp73α expression had only minor effects on the basal level of apoptosis in the H82 and U1285 cells. However, whereas p73β potentiated VP16-induced cell death, both the amino terminus-truncated ΔNp73α and the full-length p73α isoforms exhibited inhibitory effects (Fig. 1, A and B). The contrasting effects of p73α, p73β, and ΔNp73α on apoptosis were not because of differences in their level of expression or subcellular localization (Fig. 2, and data not shown). p73α appears to act in a cell type-specific manner, acting either as a pro-apoptotic (in Saos2, H1299, HEK-293, and SH-SY5Y cells), or as an anti-apoptotic molecule (in H82 and U1285 cells). Next we examined whether the inhibitory effect of p73α, observed in SCLC cells, was dependent on the type of treatment used. p73α was able to reduce the ability of cisplatin and STS to induce cell death in H82 cells, suggesting that it had a broad range inhibitory effect (Fig. 1, E and F). The Amino-terminal Activation Domain Is Not Required for the Anti-apoptotic Activity of p73α in H82 Cells—Full-length p73 isoforms function as transcription factors and regulate the expression of groups of genes by means of direct binding to what was originally identified as the p53-binding site within promoters. To determine whether the transcriptional activity domain of p73α is necessary to inhibit apoptotic cell death, a TAmutp73α construct carrying a point mutation in the TA region, which inactivates this domain, was used (Ref. 3De Laurenzi V. Raschella G. Barcaroli D. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Ranalli M. Catani M.V. Tanno B. Costanzo A. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15226-15231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and data not shown). This mutation did not affect the anti-apoptotic function of p73α. These results pointed out that a functional TA domain is not required for the anti-apoptotic effect of p73α in H82 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, TAmutp73β, with a similar mutation was unable to increase VP16-induced cell death, demonstrating that the TA domain of p73β is necessary for its pro-apoptotic function in H82 cells. The DNA Binding Domain and SAM Motif Containing Carboxyl Terminus Are Required for the Anti-apoptotic Activity of p73α in H82 Cells—Because it appeared that the TA domain of p73α is not required for its anti-apoptotic effect it was important to understand whether binding to DNA is essential for this function. A DBDmutp73α construct with a double point mutation in the DNA binding domain (14Deb D. Lanyi A. Scian M. Keiger J. Brown D.R. Le Roith D. Deb S.P. Deb S. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 401-409PubMed Google Scholar) was not able to modulate apoptosis induced by VP16, suggesting that this domain of p73α and possibly its binding to sequences into the promoter region of target genes are necessary for its inhibitory effect. Because both p73α and ΔNp73α present inhibitory functions, we hypothesized that these functions should be at least in part carried by their common COOH terminus. To prove this idea we took advantage of the deletion construct Δ84p73β, which lacks the TA domain and the carboxyl terminus extension found in p73α. This construct was unable to modulate drug-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that the COOH terminus of p73α and even ΔNp73α are required for their anti-apoptotic function in H82 cells (Fig. 2B). ΔNp73α has been reported to exert a dominant-negative effect on p53 and p73 by blocking their transactivation function hence their ability to induce apoptosis. However, it seems that in H82 cells the anti-apoptotic function of ΔNp73α is largely because of its carboxyl terminus extension, even if transactivation dominant-negative activity may participate. To further investigate the requirement of the p73α carboxyl-terminal region, a series of p73α truncation mutants, including p73αΔC424 (lacking the entire carboxyl-terminal region), p73αΔC505 (lacking the last 131 residues, including part of the SAM domain), and p73αΔC566 (lacking the last 70 residues, deleting an extreme carboxyl-terminal region but with an intact SAM domain), were used (15Ueda Y. Hijikata M. Takagi S. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, whereas p73αΔC566 showed a similar inhibitory effect as p73α, both p73αΔC424 and p73αΔC505, which lack part or the entire SAM motif, were incapable of suppressing VP16-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, C and D). It is of note that p73αΔC505, which is structurally close to the p73β isoform did not promote apoptosis, in H82 cells. This could be because of different conformations or post-translational modifications inherent to the five unique residues at the end of the β isoform, or to the 6 last amino acids coming from the carboxyl terminus of the α isoform. These data suggest that both the DNA binding domain and the SAM domain within the distal carboxyl-terminal region of p73α are involved in the inhibition of cell death. The DNA Binding Domain and Transactivation Domain Are Required for the Pro-apoptotic Activity of p73α in H1299 Cells—To determine whether the death promoting effects of p73α also depend upon the same domains as the survival ones, we analyzed the effect of p73α construc"

Two redox-active centers in the protein are initially reduced, assigned as the high potential [3Fe-4S] center and the bound ubiquinone, followed by intramolecular equilibration with the b heme in both cases. Electron equilibration at 25 °C from the ubisemiquinone proceeds with an observed rate constant of 7,200 s-1 and from the more distant [3Fe-4S] reduced center at a rate constant of 1,200 s-1. Temperature dependence studies have revealed that both reactions have large free energies of activation, with ΔG‡ values of +0.53 and +0.58 eV, respectively. Cumulative spectral changes, as well as accompanying decreases in the rates of intramolecular electron transfer, observed upon adding electrons to progressively reduced protein, indicate that 4 electrons must be introduced into the protein before the heme center is fully reduced. Overall, evidence is presented that the heme, far from being a bystander in the efficient transfer of reducing equivalents from succinate to the ubiquinone via the flavin-Fe/S centers, plays a pivotal role in providing a lower energy pathway for the transfer of an electron from the high potential [3Fe-4S] center to ubiquinone. Electron transfer within Escherichia coli succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase has been examined by the pulse radiolysis technique using spectrophotometric detection. Electrons have been introduced into the protein by the bimolecular reaction with quantified concentrations of the low potential N-methylnicotinamide radical at a rate constant of 7 × 108 m-1 s-1. Two redox-active centers in the protein are initially reduced, assigned as the high potential [3Fe-4S] center and the bound ubiquinone, followed by intramolecular equilibration with the b heme in both cases. Electron equilibration at 25 °C from the ubisemiquinone proceeds with an observed rate constant of 7,200 s-1 and from the more distant [3Fe-4S] reduced center at a rate constant of 1,200 s-1. Temperature dependence studies have revealed that both reactions have large free energies of activation, with ΔG‡ values of +0.53 and +0.58 eV, respectively.

Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (SQR), 2The abbreviations used are: SQR, succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase; NMN+, N-methylnicotinamide; NMN·, 1-electron reduced NMN+; UQ, ubiquinone; USQ, ubisemiquinone; UHQ, ubihydroquinone; Gy, gray. or succinate dehydrogenase, is the complex II of aerobic respiration in organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to man. It is responsible for the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with reducing equivalents thus obtained transferred to the membrane quinone pool. It is an integral membrane protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and inner membrane of Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, and although it does not pump protons across the membrane as do complexes I, III, and IV, its broad species distribution reflects both its early development in the course of evolution and the selective advantage it imparts. Succinate dehydrogenase from vertebrates and many bacteria consists of four subunits as follows: a matrix-exposed FAD-containing subunit (SdhA) that oxidizes succinate; an iron-sulfur-containing subunit (SdhB) that is also largely exposed to the matrix; and two integral membrane subunits (SdhC and SdhD), both of which provide the binding site for a b-type cytochrome and the quinone-reducing site of the enzyme. The recently reported x-ray crystal structure of the E. coli SQR enzyme (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) has substantiated and extended a great body of work on members of this family. The SdhA subunit has a flavin, present as a covalently linked 8-histidyl FAD. The SdhB subunit is composed of two structural domains, one containing a [2Fe-2S] center of the spinach ferredoxin variety proximal to the FAD of the SdhA subunit, and another is composed of a central [4Fe-4S] center and a distal [3Fe-4S] center. The redox-active centers comprise an approximately linear electron transport chain with edge-to-edge distances from FAD to the [3Fe-4S] center (via the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] centers) of 11.1, 9.3, and 9.1 Å. The [3Fe-4S] center is 7.6 Å from the ubiquinone (UQ)-binding site and 11.4 Å from its b heme that is coordinated by the hydrophobic SdhC and -D subunits. The reduction potentials for several of the redox-active centers are known; the three iron-sulfur centers potentials in order are +10, -175, and +65 mV, and the b heme is +35 mV (2Cecchini G. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Maklashina E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The FAD site and the bound UQ are assumed to have midpoint potentials similar to those for bovine SQR, -79 and +90 mV respectively. Thus, although electron transfer from succinate to UQ is thermodynamically favorable overall, the redox-active centers are not laid out in order of increasing affinity for reducing equivalents, a situation that is frequently encountered in enzymes possessing multiple redox-active centers. The several redox-active centers of SQR are well within the maximum distance of 14 Å thought to allow efficient electron transfer between successive redox-active centers (3Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), and the system is thus fully defined both structurally and thermodynamically. Although internal electron transfer is not thought to limit overall catalysis (kcat = 82 s-1 at 30 °C, succinate:phenazine ethosulfate-dichlorophenolindophenol reaction (4Maklashina E. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), it is of fundamental interest to understand the kinetic as well as thermodynamic aspects of electron transfer in the enzyme, and to this end we have undertaken a study of SQR using pulse radiolysis. In this method, radiolytically generated reducing equivalents are rapidly introduced into the enzyme (typically at the more solvent-exposed sites) using well defined conditions and intramolecular equilibration with other sites followed spectrophotometrically. The method has been successfully employed by us in studies of complex systems such as xanthine oxidase and trimethylamine dehydrogenase (5Hille R. Anderson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5608-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Anderson R.F. Jang M.-H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30781-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), enabling kinetic parameters between redox centers in the proteins to be defined. The role of the b heme in E. coli and mammalian complex II remains enigmatic. It is clear that the heme is necessary for proper assembly and stability of the enzyme (4Maklashina E. Rothery R.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 521-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, a role in catalytic turnover is less clear. The b heme in E. coli SQR is fully reducible by succinate under anaerobic conditions consistent with its redox potential of +35 mV (2Cecchini G. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Maklashina E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). By contrast the lower potential b heme of mammalian SQR (-185 mV) is not reducible by succinate (9Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its role as a participant in succinate oxidation is considered less likely. It is suggested, however, to play a role in fumarate reduction (reverse electron transfer) by mammalian complex II (9Yu L. Xu J.-X. Haley P.E. Yu C.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of E. coli and mammalian SQR (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H.

Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) suggests, however, that in E. coli the b heme may play a role as an electron sink preventing the formation of reactive oxygen species by the enzyme (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The lower redox potential for the heme in the mammalian enzyme may make this mechanism less effective, although the atomic distances between the heme, quinone, and iron-sulfur redox centers are very similar in both x-ray structures (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 10Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su D. Bartlam M. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), suggesting the centers play similar roles in both SQRs. The present pulse radiolysis study provides for the first time a direct role for the heme of SQR in transfer of electrons from the iron-sulfur clusters to the quinone, demonstrating it is an intrinsic component of the electron pathway in complex II. Recombinant SQR was produced by growth of E. coli transformed with plasmid pFAS, extracted from E. coli membranes using the detergent C12E9 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH), purified, and activated to remove inhibitory oxaloacetate as described previously (4Maklashina E. Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Pulse radiolysis was performed using the Dynaray 4 MV linear accelerator facility at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, which has an adjunct computer-controlled optical detection system fitted with Supracil optics (11Anderson R.F. Denny W.A. Li W. Packer J.E. Tercel M. Wilson W.R. J. Phys. Chem. 1997; 101: 9704-9709Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Electron pulses of 200-ns duration were used to deliver radiolytic doses on the order of 3 Gy (J/kg) to the temperature-controlled reaction cell (set at 25 °C), as determined by using the standard potassium thiocyanate dosimeter (12Schuler R.H. Patterson L.K. Janata E. J. Phys. Chem. 1980; 84: 2088-2089Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) to calibrate a surrounding charge collection plate to correct for small variations in the delivered doses. Under the experimental conditions used in the present study, the initially generated radiolytic radicals are eaq-, and H·, which in N2O-equilibrated buffer solutions containing 0.1 m sodium formate are quantitatively converted to CO2˙- within the duration of the 200-ns electron pulse. CO2˙- in turn quantitatively reduces N-methylnicotinamide (at a concentration of 2.5 mm in the present experiments), generating NMN· radicals within <1 μs of the electron pulse at a radiolytic concentration of 0.68 μm per Gy (13Mulazzani Q.G. Venturi M. Hoffman M.Z. Rodgers M.A.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1986; 90: 5347-5352Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is the strongly reducing NMN· radical (the reduction potential for the NMN+/NMN· couple is -1.01 ± 0.2 V (14Anderson R.F. Patel K.B. J. Chem. Soc. Faraday Trans. I. 1984; 80: 2693-2702Crossref Google Scholar)) that represents the proximal reductant of enzyme in the present protocol; NMN· radicals have been shown to react with xanthine oxidase and trimethylamine dehydrogenase with second-order rate constants in excess of 108 m-1 s-1 (5Hille R. Anderson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5608-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Anderson R.F. Jang M.-H. Hille R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30781-30786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), making it possible to follow subsequent slower (but up to in excess of 104 s-1) intramolecular electron transfer processes spectrophotometrically. UV-visible Reductive Titration of SQR—In order to understand the transient spectral changes observed in the pulse radiolysis experiments described below, a reductive titration of SQR was undertaken, using the nonphysiological reductant sodium dithionite to introduce reducing equivalents into the enzyme. Dithionite has the advantage over succinate in that it introduces reducing equivalents into the enzyme one at a time (S2O42- having dissociated into ·SO2- in aqueous solution), whereas succinate is an obligatory 2-electron donor. The results of such a titration are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of oxidized enzyme at the outset of the titration is dominated by the contribution of the b-type heme, with an absorption maximum in the Soret region at 412 nm. Contributions from the FAD and iron-sulfur clusters above 440 nm are unresolved in the absorption spectrum of the oxidized enzyme. Progressive reduction results in a shift of the heme Soret band from 412–425 nm and the appearance of α and β bands of the reduced heme at 558 and 530 nm, respectively. There is a progressive loss of absorbance in the 440–510-nm range due to reduction of the flavin and iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme. Overall equilibration of reducing equivalents within SQR is quite rapid (see below), and progressive reduction of the several redoxactive centers in the enzyme will be in the order of their reduction potentials, from highest to lowest. As a consequence, early in the course of the titration the spectral change above 400 nm associated with reduction of SQR is expected to be due to reduction of the heme and the [3Fe-4S] center (the two highest potential sites in the enzyme that give spectral changes in this region). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 (inset), the uniformity of the spectral change early in the course of the titration is reflected in the maintenance of a good isosbestic point at 418 nm for at least the first third of the titration (as judged by the absorbance change at 412 nm). Beyond this point, however, isosbesty is lost as reduction of the FAD occurs to an increasing degree. This is reflected not only in the loss of isosbesty at 418 nm but in reversal of the absorption increase at 425 nm toward the end of the titration; the final aliquots of reductant result in a slight bleaching at this wavelength (Fig. 1, inset). This behavior is at least qualitatively consistent with the ∼8:1 ratio of extinction changes for heme:flavin reduction at this wavelength. It is evident from the spectral change at 424 nm (or 558 nm) that the amount of change seen upon addition of each of the first 3 aliquots of reductant is approximately constant, and approximately doubles as the amount of reductant added in subsequent additions is doubled (Fig. 1, inset). Toward the end of the titration, however, the extent of absorbance change seen for each addition diminishes as the heme becomes fully reduced and reduction of flavin increases. As the full 8 reducing eq/enzyme is approached toward the end of the titration, the incremental absorbance change due to heme reduction diminishes (as this center becomes fully reduced), whereas that for flavin reduction continues (as reflected in continued absorbance decreases at 450 nm). The relative order of heme versus flavin reduction can also be gauged in plots of the type shown in Fig. 2, where the fractional absorbance change at 558 nm (due principally to heme reduction but with a small contribution of the iron-sulfur centers) is plotted against that at 450 nm (principally flavin reduction but with some contribution of the iron-sulfurs) or 424 nm (principally heme reduction). The deflection down and to the right for the 558 versus 450 nm plot reflects the earlier reduction of heme versus flavin in the course of the titration. By comparison, the 558 versus 424 nm plot is very close to strict proportionality throughout the majority of the titration (deviating only at the very end of the titration for the reasons described above). These results provide the context in which to understand the spectral changes seen transiently in the course of the reductive experiments described below, and in particular those experiments in which the enzyme is first partially reduced by a train of radiolytic pulses prior to examining the kinetics of electron introduction and equilibration subsequent to an additional pulse. Reaction of the NMN · Radical with SQR and Subsequent Intramolecular Electron Equilibration—The reaction of the NMN· radical with fully oxidized native protein was first examined by following the large spectral changes in the 360–560 region, where the principal absorption changes are due to reduction of the b heme. When SQR at a concentration of 50 μm was subjected to an ∼3 Gy dose, sufficient to generate 2 μm NMN· radicals, three kinetically distinct and wavelength-dependent spectral changes were seen (Fig. 3). First, the characteristic spectrum of the NMN· radical (λmax 420 nm, ϵ 3,200 m cm-1) (5Hille R. Anderson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5608-5615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Land E.J. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 162: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) is produced by 1 μs after the pulse. This spectrum decays rapidly, as monitored by a bleaching of SQR absorption in the 360–420- and 440–540-nm regions over 200 μs, followed by a further bleaching in the 360–420-nm region and a large increase in absorption in the 420–440-nm region, indicative of heme reduction, on the longer time scale to 4 ms. Three kinetic phases could be monitored over the microsecond to millisecond time range subsequent to the formation of the NMN· radical. The fastest phase (k0) was observable in the 450–500-nm region, leading to a small bleaching at these wavelengths, and the two subsequent phases (k1 and k2) were best monitored at 430 nm. Although the absorption change with time at 450 nm could be well fitted by a single exponential function, the increase in absorption at 430 nm was best fitted to two concurrent exponentials yielding k1 and k2. These data are presented in Fig. 4 for different concentrations of the oxidized protein. The fast kinetic phase increased linearly with the concentration of the protein up to ∼50 μm protein, yielding a bimolecular rate constant with standard deviation, k0, of 7.0 ± 1.6 × 108 m-1 s-1. The pseudo first-order dependence for the reaction of the NMN· radical on SQR concentration was lost at high concentrations (>50 μm), possibly due to some association between the N-methylnicotinamide and SQR. Both k1 (7200 ± 2000 s-1) and k2 (1200 ± 300 s-1) were found to be independent of the concentration of the protein with k1 showing some dependence below 10 μm. This behavior is consistent with the enzyme initially being reduced by the NMN· radical at two sites on the protein, followed by intramolecular equilibration leading to heme reduction. At sufficiently low SQR concentrations, the apparent first-order reduction of the protein becomes rate-limiting, accounting for the onset of the apparent concentration dependence of k1.FIGURE 4The dependence of the observed rate constants for the reaction of NMN· radicals with SQR on protein concentration and the subsequent protein-independent kinetic phases. Conditions are the same as in Fig. 1. Squares represent data obtained at 450 nm. Open circles and closed circles represent data obtained at 430 nm.

No spectral or kinetic changes in the reaction with the NMN· radical was observed on binding oxaloacetate to the active site containing the flavin center, suggesting that the flavin site is not involved in the reaction with NMN· radical. On the other hand, both spectral and kinetic changes were seen upon treatment of the protein with pentachlorophenol, which is a potent competitive single exchange inhibitor of SQR, displacing UQ in the protein (16Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The NMN· radical reduced pentachlorophenol-blocked protein at a similar rate to that seen with unblocked protein, but resulted in a larger proportion of the heme being reduced, an increase of some 45 ± 6%, at the end of this reaction (Fig. 5). The first of the two intramolecular electron transfer phases seen with native protein appeared to have been lost; only the initial protein concentration-dependent reduction phase, k0, was seen on the 100-μs time scale. Further reduction of the heme followed with a rate constant similar to that observed for the second intramolecular electron transfer phase in unblocked protein, k2, leading to an overall greater reduction of the heme (on a per electron basis) compared with native protein. It can be concluded from the observed lack of effect of oxaloacetate on the reaction of the NMN· radical, as well as the absence of any absorption changes that could be associated with the transient formation of either anionic or neutral flavosemiquinone, that the NMN· radical does not rapidly reduce the FAD of SQR. The observed kinetic changes upon the replacement of UQ by pentachlorophenol are consistent with a proportion of the NMN· radicals directly reducing the heme rather than the absent UQ, and therefore it follows that the faster of the 2 intramolecular electron equilibration phases in the native protein is from USQ to the heme. The observed initial bleaching of the absorption of SQR in the 360–420- and 440–540-nm regions, both in the native and blocked protein, is consistent with one of the Fe/S centers being reduced by the NMN· radical, most likely the [3Fe-4S] center on structural grounds as it is the Fe/S center most exposed to solvent (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). USQ exhibits an absorption maximum in a similar region of the spectrum as does the NMN· radical (17Land E.J. Simic M.G. Swallow A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 226: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with the neutral form having an ϵ of 3,000 m-1 cm-1 at 420 nm. The observed increase in absorption at 420–440 nm at the end of the first of the intramolecular phases is consistent with the formation of a small amount of reduced heme by this time, 200 μs after the pulse, which overcompensates for the bleaching in this region arising from the reaction of the NMN· radical with the Fe/S center. Reaction of the NMN · Radical with Partially Reduced SQR and Subsequent Intramolecular Electron Transfer—To provide information on the deposition of electrons from the NMN· radical into progressively reduced SQR, the protein (22 μm) was subjected to trains of pulses (10 × 3 Gy per pulse) that effectively titrate in 1 reducing eq of electrons per train, with observations made on a subsequent pulse at a number of wavelengths. The accumulated changes in absorption associated with each of the two intramolecular electron-transfer processes are presented in Fig. 6. Although little further increase in absorption is seen at 430 and 425 nm on adding an electron to more than 3-electron reduced proteins (4 electrons in total), bleaching continues at 410 and 450 nm until after the addition of an 8th electron. These data are interpreted as SQR requiring 4 electrons before the heme is fully reduced, whereas a total of 8 electrons are required to fully reduce all the redox centers in the protein. (This electron count is consistent with the known redox constitution of the protein, where the three Fe/S centers and heme account for 1 electron each, whereas FAD and UQ are each fully reduced by 2 electrons.) The rate constants for the intramolecular electron equilibrations, k1 and k2 measured at 430 nm, were observed to decrease with the increasing pre-pulse level of SQR reduction (Fig. 7). Both measured rate constants decrease exponentially with increasing levels of reduced protein, presumably because the ΔE decreases between the initially reduced redox-active centers and the other sites in the protein.FIGURE 7The dependence of the observed intramolecular electron transfer rate constants on the prepulse level of reduction of SQR. Conditions and method for reducing the protein are the same as for Fig. 4.

The reaction was followed at two wavelengths 430 and 410 nm for the fully oxidized protein (k1 and k2) and 410 nm for the 4-electron reduced protein (k3), because at this wavelength spectral changes continue to be seen at this level of reduction (Fig. 8). Two kinetic phases were seen when using 4-electron reduced protein, although the first phase tracked transients observed at 450 nm implying that the first phase is the bimolecular reaction of the NMN· radical with the reduced protein (which decreases in rate with progressive reduction of the protein). Data obtained over the temperature range of 6.2 to 43 °C are presented in Fig. 8 as Eyring plots to determine the thermodynamics of activation, which are presented in TABLE ONE. All reactions are endergonic, with positive ΔG ‡ and large negative ΔS ‡ values.TABLE ONEThermodynamics of activation parameters for intramolecular electron transfer in SQR Reactions 1 and 2 are the intramolecular electron transfer reactions observed following the fast one-electron of native (fully oxidized, ox) SQR by the NMN radical.

The fraction of the heme reduction can be gauged by comparing the absorption change at 430 nm (Δϵ = 19,088 ± 2529 m-1 cm-1, 10 measurements), with that for the fully reduced heme after several reducing equivalents have been added (Δϵ = 79,300 m-1 cm-1) (Fig. 6). By assuming the electron is fully equilibrated between these two centers, then the calculated ΔE = (RT/nF)ln (reduced heme)/(reduced 3Fe-4S) = 29 mV. This figure exactly matches the reported difference between the 1-electron reduction potentials of the [3Fe-4S] center, +65 mV, and the heme, +36 mV (18Ohnishi T. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Yano T. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: R23-R32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Replacement of the UQ in the protein with pentachlorophenol results in a higher proportion of heme reduction (Fig. 5) (Δϵ = 27,794 ± 1294 m-1 cm-1, 4 measurements). This is equivalent to a ΔE = 16 mV and may reflect either UQ lowering the 1-electron reduction potential of the heme or pentachlorophenol raising the reduction potential of the heme. Although the midpoint potential of UQ at pH 7, E(UQ/UHQ) is commonly quoted as +90 ± 10 mV (19Ding H. Moser C.C. Robertson D.E. Tokito M.K. Daldal F. Dutton P.L.

The E(UQ/USQ) couple is -240 mV in the quinone pool (18Ohnishi T. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Yano T. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: R23-R32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) where the semiquinone anion (pKa = 6.45 (20Land E.J. Swallow A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1890-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is formed. The USQ is likely to be protonated in the protein, possibly by proton translocation from the neighboring SdhD Tyr-D83 (1Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), thus raising the potential of the E(UQ/USQ) couple. The E(UQ/USQ) for E. coli SQR is unknown, although the value for beef heart SQR of +40 mV at pH 7.4 is often taken with E(USQ/UHQ) as +128 mV (18Ohnishi T. Moser C.C. Page C.C. Dutton P.L. Yano T. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: R23-R32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The closeness of fit of the calculated ΔE between the [3Fe-4S] and the heme centers above to the literature value implies that the 1-electron reduction potential of the bound UQ is considerably less than +36 mV, otherwise the electron would be spread over all three centers. The observation that up to 4 electrons must be introduced into SQR before the heme center is fully reduced implies that the E(UQ/USQ) couple must be high enough that the UQ is substantially reduced after addition of 2 reducing eq. Given the comparative high E(USQ/UHQ) couple, uptake of 4 electrons can be accounted for as 2 electrons on the UQ and 1 each on the [3Fe-4S] center and heme (although some reduction of the [2Fe-2S] center, with a reduction potential of +10 mV, is expected). The NMN· radical is able to fully reduce the protein beyond 4 electrons, indicating that it is active even after the high potential centers have been reduced. This implies that secondary sites such as the flavin may be reduced by the NMN· radical, although no flavosemiquinone is seen to be stabilized throughout the reductive titration series of experiments. The binding of oxaloacetate at the active sight of SQR had no discernible effect on the 1-electron reduction of fully oxidized protein, which can be understood as the NMN· radicals reacting much faster with the [3Fe-4S] and UQ centers than the flavin. The lack of discernible flavosemiquinone formation upon the reaction of the NMN· radical with partially reduced protein could arise from the intramolecular electron transfer between flavosemiquinone to the higher potential neighboring [2Fe-2S] center being faster than the pseudo first-order reduction of the protein. Again, as in the case of UQ, the formation of the hydroquinone (FH2) is most favored as the second 1-electron potential, E(F., 2H+/FH2), is much higher than the first (E(F/F.) for all flavins. Rate Constants of Intramolecular Electron Transfer in SQR—The two intramolecular kinetic phases, observed after the rapid 1-electron reduction of fully oxidized SQR, have been argued above to represent electron equilibration between 1-electron reduced (i) UQ and heme, and (ii) [3Fe-4S] center and heme. The second of these reactions proceeds with a rate constant, k,of1.2 × 1032 s-1, which represents the sum of the forward and back reactions between the two centers. The ΔE between the [3Fe-4S] center and heme is -29 mV, which gives an equilibrium constant of 0.32 from which k2f (reduced [3Fe-4S] to heme) = 290 s-1 and k2r (reduced heme to [3Fe-4S]) = 910 s-1 may be calculated. The 1-electron reduction potential of the UQ center in E. coli SQR, E(UQ/USQ), is not known but on the basis of the above is likely to be in the region +10 to +20 mV. The measured rate constant for electron transfer between these centers is 7.2 × 103 s-1, and taking the ΔE between the heme and UQ centers as approximately +20 mV gives an equilibrium constant of 2.18, from which k1f (USQ to heme) of ∼4,950 s -1 and k1r (reduced heme to UQ) of ∼2,250 s-1 may be calculated. The possibility of significant electron transfer between the [3Fe-4S[and UQ centers in 1-electron reduced protein can be ruled out because the faster of the two intramolecular phases is lost in pentachlorophenol-blocked protein, whereas the second phase is unchanged. If electron transfer along a [3Fe-4S]-UQ-heme pathway occurs, the rate constant for electron transfer between [3Fe-4S]-UQ must be <<290 s-1 to explain our observations. The preferred electron transfer pathway of [3Fe-4S]-heme-UQ may arise from the large negative ΔE of ∼50 mV between the [3Fe-4S] and UQ centers acting as a barrier to [3Fe-4S]-UQ electron transfer compared with the smaller negative ΔE between the [3Fe-4S] center and heme and between the heme and UQ, as diagrammed in Fig. 9. According to electron transfer theory (21Marcus R.A. Eyring H. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1964; 15: 155-196Crossref Google Scholar, 22Marcus R.A. Sutin N. Biochim. Biophys.

Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar) have described the dependence of the observed kET as being proportional to exp(-β rDA), where rDA is the edge-to-edge donor-acceptor distance, and β is the decay factor in the order of 1.4 ± 0.2 Å-1 for most exergonic reactions. The large negative changes in ΔS‡ and positive ΔG‡ (0.53–0.59 eV) (see TABLE ONE) indicate that the electron transfer processes investigated in this study are endergonic, not spontaneous, and lead to charge separation. Dutton and co-workers (3Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar) have addressed the effect of endergonic changes in several multiredox-centered proteins, successfully accounting for slow tunneling rates in terms of a number of parameters as follows: rDA, ΔG, β, λ (the energy required to reorganize nuclear coordinates), and ρ (the packing density between the redox centers). The calculated tunneling rates are maximal (∼3 × 1011 s-1) when ΔG matches -λ, decreasing as ΔG becomes positive and is of the order 102 s-1 for a +0.5 eV endergonic step. Such calculations for endergonic reactions qualitatively match the data in this study, although our measured rates are larger than predicted by the developed theory for the particular ΔG and rDA combinations. The results from this study provide insight into a possible role of the heme center of E. coli SQR in the overall transfer of pairs of electrons from the substrate to the quinone. The chain of Fe/S centers ensures that electrons are transferred one at a time from the substrate site through the protein. Our results indicate that the most favored sequence is electron transfer from the [3Fe-4S] center to the heme and then on to the UQ. In line with the known reduction potentials of the protein, the 1st electron will reside mainly on the [3Fe-4S] center with spread to the heme. The subsequent arrival of the 2nd electron increases the reduction level of these and other centers, but now the high E(USQ/UQH2) couple is active in taking a further electron from the heme. 4-electron reduction (by two substrate molecules) is required before the heme, UQ, and [3Fe-4S] centers are virtually filled. By directly reducing the [3Fe-4S] center with the NMN· radical species, pulse radiolysis studies have enabled the study of the key endergonic reactions in E. coli SQR to be investigated for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W1990421818,"The functional significance of the actin-binding region at the N terminus of the cardiac myosin essential light chain (ELC) remains elusive. In a previous experiment, the endogenous ventricular ELC was replaced with a protein containing a 10-amino acid deletion at positions 5–14 (ELC1vΔ5–14, referred to as 1vΔ5–14), a region that interacts with actin (Sanbe, A., Gulick, J., Fewell, J., and Robbins, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 32682–32686). 1vΔ5–14 mice showed no discernable mutant phenotype in skinned ventricular strips. However, because the myofilament lattice swells upon skinning, the mutant phenotype may have been concealed by the inability of the ELC to reach the actin-binding site. Using the same mouse model, we repeated earlier measurements and performed additional experiments on skinned strips osmotically compressed to the intact lattice spacing as determined by x-ray diffraction. 1vΔ5–14 mice exhibited decreased maximum isometric tension without a change in calcium sensitivity. The decreased force was most evident in 5–6-month-old mice compared with 13–15-month-old mice and may account for the greater ventricular wall thickness in young 1vΔ5–14 mice compared with age-matched controls. No differences were observed in unloaded shortening velocity at maximum calcium activation. However, 1vΔ5–14 mice exhibited a significant difference in the frequency at which minimum complex modulus amplitude occurred, indicating a change in cross-bridge kinetics. We hypothesize that the ELC N-terminal extension interaction with actin inhibits the reversal of the power stroke, thereby increasing isometric force.

Muscle myosin (myosin II) is a hexamer that contains two heavy chains (MHCs) 3The abbreviations used are: MHCs, myosin heavy chains; ELC, essential light chain; NTG, non-transgenic; wt, wild-type; BES, N,N-bis(2-hydroexyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 3The abbreviations used are: MHCs, myosin heavy chains; ELC, essential light chain; NTG, non-transgenic; wt, wild-type; BES, N,N-bis(2-hydroexyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance., with each heavy chain having two types of light chains: the essential light chain (ELC) and the regulatory light chain. The MHCs separate into two globular heads at their N terminus, with the remainder being a coiled coil that, with the other MHC tail regions, forms the backbone of the thick filament. Muscle contraction is generated by the cyclic interaction of the myosin heads with actin in the thin filaments, drawing the filaments past one another. Both myosin light chains are involved in stabilizing the lever arm, the long α-helix extending from the catalytic motor part of the myosin head to the coiled-coil backbone. Most regulatory light chains modulate the interaction of the myosin head with actin through phosphorylation of residues near the N terminus (1Sweeney H.L. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. Am. J.

In human skeletal muscle, the A1-type fast (ELC1f) and slow (ELC1s) ELC isoforms contain 40–45 additional amino acids compared with the A2-type fast isoform (ELC3f) (14Timson D.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The longer skeletal muscle ELC isoforms cross-link to the C-terminal region of actin through their N-terminal α-amino group and four lysines within the first 10 residues (10Sweeney H.L. Biophys.

In human cardiac muscle, both ventricular (ELC1v) and atrial (ELC1a) ELC isoforms have N-terminal extensions of approximately the same length as their A1-type counterparts in skeletal muscle. The atrial isoform N-terminal extension has been shown to interact with actin (13Timson D.J. Trayer H.R. Smith K.J. Trayer I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18271-18277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the ventricular isoform extension is generally assumed to do so as well. A previous study examined the role of the actin-binding region at the N terminus of the ventricular ELC in a transgenic mouse model (18Sanbe A. Gulick J. Fewell J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32682-32686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension of the ventricular ELC in the mouse is similar to that in the human (14Timson D.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Sanbe A.

In skinned atrial and ventricular strips from transgenic mice in which ELC residues 5–14 (ELC1vΔ5–14, referred to as 1vΔ5–14) were deleted, some of which interact with actin (10Sweeney H.L. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2480-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), there was a surprising lack of morphological and functional differences between transgenic (1vΔ5–14) and non-transgenic (NTG) controls. The calcium sensitivity of isometric tension of 1vΔ5–14 was similar to that of controls (absolute tensions were not reported), and there were no observed differences in MgATPase activity and shortening velocity at maximum calcium activation (pCa 5) (18Sanbe A. Gulick J. Fewell J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32682-32686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The lack of morphological and functional differences was unexpected because other experiments involving the addition of 10-residue peptides consisting of the deleted region or portions thereof (ELC residues 1–10 (19Nieznanska H. Nieznanski K. Stepkowski D. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2002; 49: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and 5–14 (20Morano I. Ritter O. Bonz A. Timek T. Vahl C.F. Michel G. Circ.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) showed effects on cross-bridge kinetics. For example, adding ELC residues 5–14 to rat ventricle myofibrils resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in MgATPase at submaximum calcium concentrations (pCa 6.5–5.875) (21Rarick H.M. Opgenorth T.J. von Geldern T.W. Wu-Wong J.R. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27039-27043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Likewise, a peptide corresponding to A1-type fast ELC residues 1–10 added to myofibrillar preparations from rabbit fast muscles enhanced MgATPase, but over a higher range of calcium concentrations (pCa 5.75–4.59) (19Nieznanska H. Nieznanski K. Stepkowski D. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2002; 49: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) compared with the other peptide. In contrast, a peptide corresponding to slow ELC residues 1–10 added to myofibrils from slow muscles decreased MgATPase over the entire range of calcium concentrations examined. Incubating human heart strips in solutions containing peptides corresponding to human ELC extension residues 5–14, 5–10, and 5–8 resulted in increased isometric tension (20Morano I. Ritter O. Bonz A. Timek T. Vahl C.F. Michel G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Treatment with peptide 5–14 (which enhanced isometric tension more than the other peptides) also produced an increased maximum rate of tension rise, an increased maximum rate of relaxation, and increased shortening velocity compared with untreated strips. Thus, given the contrasting experimental results, the functional significance of the actin-binding residues in the N terminus of the cardiac ELC remains elusive. Lattice spacing (the distance between thick and thin filaments) increases upon skinning of intact muscle fibers (22Irving T.C. Konhilas J. Perry D. Fischetti R. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2568-H2573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Irving T. Bhattacharya S. Tesic I. Moore J. Farman G. Simcox A. Vigoreaux J. Maughan D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased distance between filaments may have compromised the ability of the ELC N-terminal extension to reach actin in previous skinned strip experiments using the 1vΔ5–14 mouse (18Sanbe A. Gulick J. Fewell J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32682-32686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), thereby masking the effect of the 10-amino acid deletion. A similar concern was expressed with regard to the effect of lattice spacing on the function of the regulatory light chain extension in Drosophila flight muscle, which bears a striking resemblance to the vertebrate ELC extension (23Irving T. Bhattacharya S. Tesic I. Moore J. Farman G. Simcox A. Vigoreaux J. Maughan D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Moore J.R. Dickinson M.H.

In this study, we re-examined the phenotype of the 1vΔ5–14 transgenic mouse both in vivo and in isolated skinned strips that were osmotically compressed to intact lattice spacing. We also examined the effect of age because the phenotype may be age-dependent. Our results strongly suggest that an interaction between residues 5–14 of the ELC N terminus and the C-terminal residues of actin enhances cardiac performance. Materials—All reagents were purchased from Sigma except where noted. Mouse Model—We used the same 1vΔ5–14 transgenic and control (NTG) lines as in previous studies (5Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J.

Female mice were used in all experiments. Echocardiography—1vΔ5–14 and NTG female mice were examined by echocardiography at two ages: young (20 weeks) and old (53 weeks). Mice were lightly anesthetized with halothane and placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Parasternal short-axis images of the heart at the mid-papillary level were obtained using a clinical echocardiograph machine (ACUSON Sequoia, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA) equipped with a 13-MHz probe. Using the two-dimensional short-axis image to correctly position the probe, M-mode echo data were recorded. Left ventricular volumes and wall thickness values were quantified from the digitized M-mode images using standard software (ACUSON Sequoia). Three representative cardiac cycles, each obtained from separate traces, were analyzed during each study to minimize selection bias. Transcript and Myosin Heavy Chain Analyses—Transcript analysis with sequence-specific oligonucleotides was performed as described previously (5Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J. Osinska H. Lorenz J.

Solutions—Relaxing solution (pCa 8) contained 20 mm BES, 5 mm EGTA, 40 mm disodium creatine phosphate, 240 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5.38 mm N2ATP, 7.71 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm KH2PO4, 0.12 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol titrated with 1.78 mm KOH to pH 7.0 and adjusted with 17.48 mm sodium methanesulfonate to an ionic strength of 190 milliequivalents, yielding 5 mm MgATP, 1 mm Mg+2, and 0.25 mm free phosphate according to a computer program that solves the ionic equilibria (28Godt R.E. Lindley B.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1982; 80: 279-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Activating solution (pCa 4, pH 7, 190 milliequivalents) contained the same concentrations of MgATP, Mg+2, and free phosphate and other constituents as in relaxing solution, except for an increased calcium concentration (5.28 mm CaCl2) and slight adjustments in the concentrations of other salts (5.53 mm Na2ATP, 7.55 mm MgCl2, 11.3 mm KOH, and 7.01 mm sodium methanesulfonate). ATP-free rigor solution (pCa 4.5, pH 7, 190 milliequivalents) contained 4.97 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 9.8 mm KOH, and 154.8 mm sodium methanesulfonate. Storage solution had the same constituents as relaxing solution plus 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 50% (w/v) glycerol. Skinning solution had the same constituents as storage solution plus 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 (a nonionic detergent). For the x-ray diffraction experiments, 0–10% (w/v) dextran T-500 (an osmotic compression agent) was added to relaxing solution to establish the concentration required to compress the skinned strip lattice to its intact spacing. For the mechanical experiments, 5.4% (w/v) dextran T-500 (the concentration required to compress the skinned strip lattice to its intact spacing) was added to relaxing, activating, and rigor solutions. Myocardial Strip Preparation—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the hearts were rapidly excised and placed in O2 (95%)/CO2 (5%)-bubbled Krebs solution containing 30 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime at 22 °C (29Mulieri L.A. Hasenfuss G. Ittleman F. Blanchard E.M. Alpert N.R. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The right ventricle was trimmed, and the papillary muscles from the left ventricle were removed. Papillary muscles were dissected to yield at least three thin strips (∼100–140 μm in diameter and ∼600 μm in length) consisting of longitudinally oriented bundles of myocytes as described previously (29Mulieri L.A. Hasenfuss G. Ittleman F. Blanchard E.M. Alpert N.R. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Blanchard E. Seidman C. Seidman J.G. LeWinter M. Maughan D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Strips were skinned for 2 h at 22 °C and stored at –20 °C for no more than 1 week. (Generally, myocardial strip experiments were performed the day of dissection or the day after.) Shortly before each experiment, an aluminum T-clip was attached to each end, producing an undisturbed central segment of ∼200 μm. X-ray Diffraction—Papillary muscle strips from four 1vΔ5–14 and four NTG mice at 13 weeks of age were prepared as described above, secured between adjustable hooks in a perfusion chamber that contained relaxing solution, and stretched to 2.2-μm sarcomere length. The perfusion chamber had thin Mylar windows that allowed the x-ray beam to pass through the strip. X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained using the small angle instrument on the BioCAT beam line (31Irving T.C. Fischetti R. Rosenbaum G. Bunker G.B. Nucl. Instr. and Meth. A. 2000; 448: 250-254Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a CCD detector at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) as described previously (22Irving T.C. Konhilas J. Perry D. Fischetti R. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2568-H2573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The separation of the 1,0 equatorial reflections in diffraction patterns is inversely proportional to the distance between the crystallographic lattice planes of hexagonally packed thick filaments (d1,0). Lattice spacing (d1,0) was converted to interfilament spacing (d1,0× 2/√3) as a measure of the center-to-center spacing between thick filaments (22Irving T.C. Konhilas J. Perry D. Fischetti R. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2568-H2573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interfilament spacing was measured in relaxing solution before skinning (intact spacing) and after skinning in the presence of 0–10% (w/v) dextran T-500. Skinned Myocardial Strip Mechanics—We conducted sinusoidal analysis on skinned myocardial strips obtained from mice that had echocardiograms. Papillary muscle strips were isolated from 1vΔ5–14 and NTG mice at 24 (young) and 58 (old) weeks, skinned, and T-clipped as described above. A strip was mounted between a piezoelectric motor (Physik Instrumente, Auburn, MA) and a strain gauge (SensorNor, Horten, Norway), lowered into a 30-μl droplet of relaxing solution maintained at 27 °C, and incrementally stretched to (and maintained at) 2.2-μm sarcomere length as determined using a filar micrometer (30Blanchard E. Seidman C. Seidman J.G. LeWinter M. Maughan D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Papillary muscle strips were calcium-activated by exchanging equal volumes of bathing solution for activating solution, thereby incrementally increasing the free calcium concentration from pCa 8.0 to pCa 4.25. Individual recordings of normalized isometric tension were fit to the Hill equation: [Ca2+]n/([Ca2+]50n + [Ca2+]n), where [Ca2+]50 is the calcium concentration at half-activation, pCa50 is –log [Ca2+]50, and n is the Hill coefficient. At each calcium concentration, sinusoidal perturbations of amplitude 0.125% strip length were applied at 42 discrete frequencies (0.125–100 Hz). Complex stiffness (expressed as the amplitude ratio and the phase shift between the force response and length perturbation) was calculated at each frequency (30Blanchard E. Seidman C. Seidman J.G. LeWinter M. Maughan D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Kawai M. Saeki Y. Zhao Y. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Kawai M. Brandt P.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Complex modulus (i.e. normalized complex stiffness) was calculated by multiplying the complex stiffness by the length of the muscle preparation and then dividing by the cross-sectional area. Thus, the amplitude of the complex modulus is the ratio of the stress response to the strain perturbation, whereas the phase of the complex modulus is the shift of the stress with respect to the strain. Because the strain perturbation was held constant in these experiments, the amplitude and phase of the complex modulus provide insight into changes in stress. At maximum calcium activation (pCa 4.25), the velocity of unloaded shortening was determined using the Edman slack test (34Edman K.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1979; 291: 143-159Crossref Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Experimental runs were concluded by conducting sinusoidal analysis on strips bathed in rigor solution, followed by chemical fixation (10% (v/v) glutaraldehyde added to rigor solution) that allowed a measure of end compliance (i.e. the compliance of the T-clipped portion in series with the fixed central muscle segment). Data Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Version 11.0. Statistical tests were considered significant at the p < 0.05 level. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the strain effects (1vΔ5–14 versus NTG) on the interfilament spacing data. A two-way ANOVA was performed to determine the effects of strain (1vΔ5–14 versus NTG) and age (young versus old) on the echocardiogram, morphology, velocity, isometric tension, power, and frequency of maximum power data (data independent of strip oscillation frequency). A one-way ANOVA was also performed on the same data to determine additional relationships between the various means. If the one-way ANOVA differences were significant, the least significant difference post hoc test was used to determine which means differed. A repeated measures ANOVA with strip oscillation frequency as the repeated measure was performed on the elastic and viscous moduli to examine whether these data changed with oscillation frequency. If a significant frequency by strain or age interaction was found, then a two-way ANOVA was performed at each frequency to determine the effects of strain and age. Echocardiographic and Weight Measures—Although echocardiographic methods indicated a significant increase in posterior wall thickness for young 1vΔ5–14 mice (TABLE ONE), overall, the ventricular-to-body weight ratios were not significantly different between the cohorts (TABLE TWO). The end systolic and end diastolic left ventricular diameters of 1vΔ5–14 mice were similar to those of NTG mice (TABLE ONE), demonstrating that the internal chamber volumes and hence ejection fraction were comparable between the different strains and ages. Heart rates decreased significantly (18%) with age for 1vΔ5–14 mice, whereas the heart rates for NTG mice did not change with age (TABLE ONE), as reported in a previous study (35Yang B. Larson D.F.

No overt changes could be detected in the transcript levels among the NTG and 1vΔ5–14 cohorts (Fig. 1A). α- and β-MHC protein levels were also similar among 1vΔ5–14, NTG, and ELC1v-wt mice (Fig. 1B). The similarity in gene expression and MHC protein levels indicates that no significant pathological hypertrophic response occurred at the molecular and protein levels. X-ray Diffraction—Prior to conducting the mechanical experiments on isolated skinned myocardial strips, we carried out small angle x-ray diffraction experiments to determine the osmotic pressure required to restore the myofilament lattice of the skinned preparation to its intact spacing. The thick-to-thick filament distance (44.9 nm) in the intact strip from 1vΔ5–14 mice was not significantly different compared with NTG mice (Fig. 2). The lattice of both strains expanded by ∼8% upon skinning, consistent with the loss of the osmotic constraint to swelling ordinarily imposed by the pla"

The anti-gp350 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-72A1 Fab inhibits this binding and therefore blocks EBV invasion of target cells. However, gp350/220 regions interacting with mAb 72A1 and involved in EBV invasion of target cells have not yet been identified.

Peptides 11382, 11389, and 11416 bound to CR2(+) but not to CR2(-) cells, inhibited EBV invasion of cord blood lymphocytes (CBLs), were recognized by mAb 72A1, and inhibited mAb 72A1 binding to EBV. Peptides 11382 and 11416 binding to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) induced interleukin-6 protein synthesis in these cells, this phenomenon being inhibited by mAb 72A1. The same behavior has been reported for gp350/220 binding to PBLs. Anti-peptide 11382, 11389, and 11416 antibodies inhibited EBV binding and EBV invasion of PBLs and CBLs.

It is known that gp350 binds to B-lymphocyte CR2 (known as C3d receptor) with a 3.2 nm affinity constant (12 nm affinity has been determined for B-lymphocyte surface) (1Maruo S. Yang L. Takada K.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20576-20582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This simple 1:1 interaction is involved in adsorption, capping, and EBV endocytosis and is considered to be a primary determinant of EBV tissue tropism (3Ahearn J.M. Hayward S.D. Hickey J.C.

The CR2 region binding to gp350 overlaps the CR2 region binding to C3dg. The gp350 N-terminal region contains part of the B-lymphocyte binding domain (5Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E.

Virol. 1987; 61: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binds to purified CR2 and to CR2(+) but not to CR2(-) B- and T-lymphoblastoid cell lines; this peptide coupled to BSA inhibits CR2 binding to EBV and gp350 (7Nemerow G.R. Houghten R.A. Moore M.D. Cooper N.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This peptide inhibits C3dg binding to B-cells (as well as EBV) and also inhibits C3-induced Raji cell proliferative response (7Nemerow G.R. Houghten R.A. Moore M.D. Cooper N.R.

However, the 470-mer N-terminal recombinant protein and gp220, containing this peptide sequence, present single-component binding, whereas gp350/220 presents a higher affinity two-component binding to CR2 (5Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sarrias M.R. Franchini S. Canziani G. Argyropoulos E. Mooer W.T. Sahu A. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and inhibits only 50% of EBV binding and EBV infection of Raji cells (5Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the monomer gp350 peptide (16IHLTGEDPGFFNVE29) does not inhibit gp350/220 or C3dg binding to CR2(+) cells; BOS-1 monoclonal antibody (recognizing peptide 14SLIHLTGEDPGFFN27) does not inhibit peptide 16IHLTGEDPGFFNVE29 Raji binding or block virus adsorption or infectivity (5Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C3dg region (homologous to this gp350 peptide) is not in contact with CR2 in the reported complex structure (10Szakonyi G. Guthridge J.M. Li D Young K. Holers V.M. Chen X.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is thus very likely that other gp350/220 regions are involved in EBV binding to B-lymphocytes. The gp350/220 region containing the epitope recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibody 72A1 is one of the most important regions involved in gp350/220 binding to B-lymphocyte CR2, because the mAb 72A1 Fab fragment inhibits EBV binding and invasion of host cells (5Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Stocco R. Sauvageau G. Stefanescu I. Menezes J. Intervirology. 1990; 31: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, mAb 72A1 inhibits EBV invasion of monocytes (12Salek-Ardakani S. Lyons S.A. Arrand J.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), neutrophils (13Roberge C.J. Poubelle P.E. Beaulieu A.D. Heitz D. Gosselin J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4884-4891PubMed Google Scholar), and T-cells (14Hedrick J.A. Lao Z. Lipps S.G. Wang Y. Todd S.C. Lambris J.D. Tsoukas C.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4418-4426PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-gp350/220 mAb 72A1 also inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein synthesis induced in PBLs by gp350/220 binding to CR2 (15Tanner J.E. Alfieri C. Chatila T.A. Diaz-and Mitoma F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 570-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); it also inhibits EBV invasion of B-lymphocytes (5Tanner J. Whang Y. Sample J. Sears A. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4452-4464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the gp350/220 region involved in EBV invasion of host cells is recognized by this monoclonal antibody; however, its precise localization remains unknown. The purpose of this work was thus to identify B-lymphocyte binding sequences that are involved in EBV virus infection of B-lymphocytes. Peptide Synthesis—Forty-six peptides, covering the total length of EBV gp350-reported sequence (16Baer R.J. Bankier A.T. Biggin M.D. Deininger P.L. Farrell P.J. Gibson T.J. Hatfull G.F. Hudson G.S.

These peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Synthesized peptide sequences are shown in Fig. 1. Tyrosine (Y) was C-terminally added, allowing those peptides not containing this amino acid to be radiolabeled. Lymphoblastoid Cell Line Cultures—The cloned Raji (19Epstein M.A. Achong B.G. Barr Y.M.

Virol. 1978; 28: 444-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kept in culture in adjusted RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. All of the cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% humidified CO2 atmosphere. HeLa cells, cultured in monolayers, were harvested by adding PBS-EDTA followed by spinning at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed three times for 5 min at 1,000 × g with PBS and then counted in a Newbauer chamber, and their viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. Human Leukocyte Isolation—Cord blood and peripheral blood were collected in EDTA-treated sterile tubes from patients attending the Materno Infantil Hospital in Bogotá. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Cord blood lymphocytes (CBLs) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were separated by sedimentation on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients. The obtained lymphocytes were washed five times with RPMI 1640, spun at 300 × g for 7 min at room temperature, and counted in a Newbauer chamber (23Delves P.J. Delves P.J. Antibody Productions: Essential Techniques. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, NY1997: 64-65Google Scholar). Epstein-Barr Virus—The EBV used for studies was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC catalogue no. VR-1492). 125I Peptide Labeling—Peptides were 125I-labeled by the chloramine-T protocol. Briefly, 3.2 μl of Na125I (17.2 mCi/μg) reacted with 28 μg of chloramine-T and 5 μg of peptide. The reaction was stopped by adding 14 μg of sodium bisulfite in isotonic PBS (pH 7.4). The radiolabeled peptide was purified by using size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-10 column. 125I-Labeled peptide specific activities were between 80 and 160 μCi/nmol. Peptide Cell Binding Assay—2, 4, 8, and 12 nm concentrations of 125I-labeled peptide were incubated in triplicate with a Raji, Ramos, or P3HR-1 cells or erythrocyte cell suspensions (104 cells μl-1) in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of unlabeled peptide (1.25 μm) for 1 h at 18°C. Cells were then separated from the medium by spinning at 10,000 × g for 1 min through a dibutylphthalate-dioctylphthalate cushion (d = 1.015 g ml-1). Cell-bound 125I-labeled peptide was measured, and specific binding for each peptide was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. Cell binding activity for each peptide was defined as the ratio of specific binding over the amount of added radiolabeled peptide. Nemerow's peptide (peptide 11420), which specifically binds to Raji cell (7Nemerow G.R. Houghten R.A. Moore M.D. Cooper N.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (used as the positive binding control peptide), presented 0.034 binding activity. High activity binding peptide saturation curves were performed incubating 104 cells μl-1, with 125I-labeled peptide at a 5-700 nm concentration in the absence or presence of 40 μm unlabeled peptide. Hill analysis was performed as reported previously (24Weiland G.A. Molinoff P.B. Life Sci. 1981; 29: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Briefly, bound (b) and non-bound (free) peptide was measured in saturation assays. Hill analysis were done by determining log(b/(bmax -b) in function of log(free); bmax represents the maximum number of cell receptors to which the peptide could bind (depending on the total number of peptide cell receptors). The slope of this plot gives the Hill coefficient. Immunization Protocol—Each New Zealand rabbit was immunized subcutaneously with 500 μg of a HABP of interest plus 150 μg of the T-helper epitope FISEAIIHVLHSR (25Prieto I. Hervas-Stubbs S. Garcia-Granero M. Berasain C. Riezu-Boj J.I. Lasarte J.J. Sorobe P. Prieto J. Boras-Cuesta F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), emulsified with 250 μl Freund's complete adjuvant (500 μl final volume), and boosted on days 20, 40, 60, and 80 with the same antigen dose in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Blood was drawn 20 days after the second, third, and fourth doses. ELISA—Plates coated with 1 μg of peptide/well in 100 μl of PBS at 4 °C overnight were subsequently blocked with a 2% of fat-free dry milk in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (PBSMT) for 2 h at 37 °C. 100 μl of the appropriate serial rabbit serum dilutions were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then incubated with a 1/5,000 dilution of anti-rabbit peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) at 37 °C for 1 h followed by color development with a solution prepared by 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine peroxidase substrate (KPL) for 15 min; absorbency was read at 620 nm. For sandwich ELISA, plates were coated with 100 μl of mAb 72A1 (2.5 μg/ml) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. Plates were then blocked with PBSMT for 1 h at 37°C. Wells were subsequently incubated with increasing peptide solutions (0.3125-10 μg/ml) or with different EBV dilutions (1/10 to 1/320) for 2 h at 18 °C. Wells were then incubated with 100 μl of a 1/4000 anti-EBV or anti-HABP rabbit serum dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Control wells were treated in a similar way but using PBS instead of mAb 72A1. The conditions for the competitive sandwich ELISA (established by using HABP or EBV mAb 72A1 binding curves) were 4 μg/ml 11382, 0.15 μg/ml 11389, or 4 μg/ml 11416 HABPs bound to mAb 72A1 in the presence of 1/20 to 1/1280 EBV dilutions; 1/20 EBV dilution were bound to mAb 72A1 in the presence of 0.0024-10 μg/ml HABPs for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were then incubated with 100 μl of anti-HABP (1/4,000 dilution) or anti-EBV (1/500 dilution) sera for 2 h at 18 °C. Color development was performed as mentioned above (26Koizumi S. Zhang X.K. Imai S. Sugiura M. Usui N. Osato T. Virology. 1992; 188: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis—500,000 cells were washed twice with 0.5% PBS-BSA, spinning at 2,500 rpm for 5 min, for flow cytometry analysis. The cells were then treated with a flow cytometry fixation and permeabilization kit (Dako) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cellular pellet was suspended in 100 μl of 0.5% PBS-BSA containing a 1/640 serum dilution or with 100 μl of a 1/400 72A-1 monoclonal antibody dilution on ice for 45 min. This mixture was incubated for 50 min at 18 °C. The cells were then washed three times with PBS-BSA, spun at 2,500 rpm for 5 min, incubated with 100 μl of a 1/200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 and phycoerythrin-labeled rat anti-human T-cell receptor for 30 min at 4 °C or with 100 μl of a 1/50 dilution fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2 (Vector Laboratories), and finally washed twice with PBS. Fluorescence cells were read by a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Rabbit Antibody Isolation—Rabbit sera were diluted four times with 60 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.0); the pH was then raised to 4.5 by adding 0.1 n NaOH. 25 μl/ml caprylic acid was added and stirred for 30 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was separated. A 1/10 volume of 10×PBS was added to the obtained supernatant and the pH adjusted to 7.4 with 0.1 n NaOH. The immunoglobulin fraction was precipitated with 0.35 g/ml ammonium sulfate overnight at 4 °C. The pellet was separated by spinning at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and suspended in PBS. The immunoglobulin solution was dialyzed extensively with PBS. The isolated protein concentration was determined by the Bradford test (100-170 μg/ml) and antibody activity by ELISA and immunofluorescence (27McKinney M.M. Parkinson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Epstein-Barr Virus Invasion of CBLs—2×105 cord blood lymphocytes (in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.4 μg/ml cyclosporin A, and 5 mm CaCl2) were incubated with 30 μl of EBV-containing supernatant for 30 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. 70 μl of RPMI 1640 medium was then added and the samples incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After incubation, cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640 medium (fetal bovine serum-free), and their DNA was obtained for PCR amplification. CBLs were preincubated with 8 μm HABPs for 15 min at 37 °C, or 30 μl of EBV was preincubated with 30 μl of rabbit isolated antibodies (100-170 μg/ml), for 1 h at 37 °C before EBV invasion assays were performed to determine the effect of HABP or anti-HABP antibodies on EBV invasion of CBLs. EBV invasion of CBLs without HABPs or isolated antibodies was used as positive control. CBLs, treated under the same conditions as a positive control but without EBV supernatant, were used as negative control. EBV DNA Identification by PCR Amplification—DNA was obtained by proteinase K digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. This DNA was dissolved in 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA), 0.5 mg/ml final concentration (28Sambrook J Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 2.1.1-2.1.7Google Scholar). PCR was performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and each of the following 200 μm deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 0.1-0.5 μg of template DNA, each primer at 0.5 μm, and 1.0 unit of Taq polymerase. Previously reported primers (29Chen P.C. Pan C.C. Yang A.H. Wang L.S. Chiang H. J. Pathol. 2002; 197: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Salimi B. Alonso E.M. Cohn R.A. Mendley S.R. Katz B.Z. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2002; 21: 433-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to specifically amplify EBV DNA: 5′-TTCATCACCGTCGCTGACT-3′ upstream sequence and 5′-ACCGCTTACCACCTCCTCT-3′ downstream sequence. These primers specifically amplified a 300-bp DNA fragment from EBV(+) cells (Raji or B95-8), but not EBV(-) cells (CBLs, erythrocyte fraction, or HeLa cells). PCR conditions consisted of 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s in a 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (29Chen P.C. Pan C.C. Yang A.H. Wang L.S. Chiang H. J. Pathol. 2002; 197: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was separated and ethidium bromide-stained on 2.5% agarose gels; the PCR product was visualized on a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Producing mAb 72A1—Female 4-week-old Balb/c mice were immunized with 200 μl of Pristane (ICN) and 10 days later with 1 × 106 hybridoma cells (ATCC HB-168) in 200 μl of sterile PBS. Ascitic fluid was drained between the 15th and 30th day following hybridoma cell immunization. Antibody presence was determined by ELISA, sandwich ELISA, and cytometry analysis. IL-6 Protein Quantification—300 μl 1 × 106 PBLs were incubated with 150 μl of EBV or each HABP at 13.3 μm for 96 h at 37 °C. The supernatant thus obtained was stored at -20 °C until IL-6 protein was determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The effect of 10 μg/ml mAb 72A1 on IL-6 protein synthesis induced by HABP-11382 or -11389 (11 μm) or EBV was determined. In other experiments, EBV was treated for 15 min at 4 °C with 100-160 μg/ml anti-HABP or anti-EBV isolated antibodies or with 10 μg/ml mAb 72A1 to determine the effects of these antibodies on EBV-induced IL-6 protein synthesis. Also, the effect of 10 μg/ml mAb 72A on EBV-induced IL-6 protein synthesis was determined in the presence of 8 μm HABP-11382, -11389, or -11416. Identifying B-lymphocyte-binding Regions in gp350—gp350/220 specifically binds to the CR2 molecule, which has been found on Raji and Ramos but not P3HR-1 cells (31Klein E. Di Renzo L. Yefenof E. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1343-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Reisert P.S. Spiro R.C. Townsend P.L. Standford S.A. Sairenji T. Humphreys R.E. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3776-3780PubMed Google Scholar). Raji and Ramos cells were thus chosen as positive cell binding control and P3HR-1 as negative cell binding control for selecting B-lymphocyte-binding gp350 peptides. The CR2 molecule was determined on Raji and Ramos cells, but not on P3HR-1, by using flow cytometry analysis with the previously reported CR2-recognizing monoclonal antibody (33Weis J.J. Tedder T.F. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Peptides 11381, 11382, 11388, 11389, and 11394 from the gp350 N-terminal region and 11415 and 11416 from the gp350 C-terminal region presented CR2(+) Raji and Ramos cell binding activity higher than or equal to 0.034 (the known value for the binding activity of Nemerow's peptide), but these peptides did not bind to CR2(-) P3HR-1 cells (Fig. 1). These peptides were named CR2(+) cell HABPs, of which 11381, 11382, 11388, 11389, and 11416 presented conserved amino acid sequences in the gp350/220 protein reported to date, whereas the HABPs 11394 and 11415 presented Lys401 and Pro812 amino acid variations in their respective sequences. Raji cell affinity constants determined for these CR2(+) cell HABPs (except for HABP-11381 for which the affinity constant could not be determined from the obtained data) were in the 40-340 nm range, with HABP-11415 exhibiting the highest binding affinity (Kd = 40 nm), slightly higher than control peptide 11420 (Kd = 68 nm). HABPs 11388, 11389, and 11394 showed affinity constants of around 300 nm and HABPs 11382 and 11416 around 150 nm. HABPs 11382, 11388, 11389, 11394, and 11416 presented Hill coefficients of around 1, suggesting a single type of receptor-ligand interaction, but HABP-11415 presented a Hill coefficient of 2.0, suggesting positive cooperativity (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEPeptide binding constants and Hill coefficients to Raji cellsPeptideKdHill coefficientnm11381aThe Kd and Hill coefficient could not be determined from the obtained data.NDbND, not determined.ND113821701.4113883301.3113893401.0113942900.911415402.0114161201.111420cThis is Nemerow's peptide.681.0a The Kd and Hill coefficient could not be determined from the obtained data.b ND, not determined.c This is Nemerow's peptide. Open table in a new tab CR2(+) Cell HABPs Inhibited EBV Attachment to B-lymphocytes—gp350/220 binding to CR2 on PBLs induces IL-6 synthesis (15Tanner J.E. Alfieri C. Chatila T.A. Diaz-and Mitoma F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 570-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34D'Addario M. Libermann T.A. Xu J. Ahmad A. Menezes J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Tanner J.E. Menezes J. Blood. 1994; 84: 3956-3964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBLs were thus exposed to CR2(+) cell HABPs, and IL-6 protein synthesis level was determined in the supernatant of these cell cultures. PBLs exposed to HABPs 11381, 11388, 11389, 11394, or 11415 showed IL-6 protein levels similar to that of non-treated PBLs, suggesting that these peptides did not have any effect on IL-6 synthesis. On the contrary, PBLs exposed to HABPs 11382 and 11416 increased four times the IL-6 protein levels, similar to IL-6 protein levels induced in PBLs by exposure to EBV (Fig. 2A). It is probable that mAb 72A1 binds to some of these HABP sequences. ELISA revealed that HABPs 11382, 11389, and 11416 specifically bound to mAb 72A1 in a dose-dependent way, showing 72, 100, or 55% EBV binding to mAb 72A1, respectively, with antibody titers higher than or equal to 25,600 at 10 μg/ml peptide. On the other hand, HABPs 11381, 11388, 11394, and 11415 presented no significant binding to mAb 72A1 at the same peptide concentrations (less than 20% of the binding obtained with EBV) (Fig. 2B). Moreover, HABPs 11382, 11389, and 11416, but not the nonrelevant peptide, inhibited mAb 72A1 binding to EBV in a dose-dependent manner, just as EBV did, as determined by ELISA (Fig. 2C). PBLs were also exposed to HABP-11382, -11389, or -11416 or EBV in the presence or absence of mAb 72A1, and IL-6 protein levels were then determined; mAb 72A1 inhibited more than 50% of IL-6 protein synthesis induced by HABP-11382 or -11416 or EBV (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the effect of mAb 72A1 on EBV-induced IL-6 synthesis was eliminated when mAb 72A1 had been incubated previously with HABP-11382, -11389, or -11416 (Fig. 2E). CR2(+) Cell HABPs Induced Antibodies Recognizing EBV-infected Cells and Inhibited IL-6 Protein Synthesis Induced by EBV Binding to PBLs—Each rabbit was immunized with one of the CR2(+) cell HABPs; these peptides induced antibodies with anti-HABP antibody titers between 6,400 and 51,200 as determined by ELISA. These anti-HABP antibodies also recognized EBV by ELISA but with lower antibody titers (between 3,200 and 25,600) (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, anti-EBV antibodies were able to recognize these HABPs with antibody titers between 1,600 and 6,400. Anti-HABP antibodies isolated from rabbit sera through precipitation with caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate specifically recognized a 11.3 ± 3.2% mean of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-stimulated B95-8 cells (EBV-infected cells) but only 1.6 ± 0.5% of CBLs (non-EBV-infected cells) by flow cytometry. Anti-EBV antibodies recognized around 31.64% of B95-8 cells and only 3.86% of CBLs. On the contrary, antibodies isolated from sera obtained before the first immunization or anti-nonrelevant peptide antibodies recognized only a 2.6 ± 1.8 mean of the B95-8 cells or CBLs (Fig. 3B). EBV binding to PBLs induced IL-6 protein synthesis in these cells; but when EBV was treated previously with anti-HABP-11382, -11389, or -11416 antibodies, the IL-6 protein synthesis induction diminished between 50 and 70%, in the same way that anti-EBV antibodies did. This effect was not seen with anti-nonrelevant peptide antibodies (Fig. 4). CR2(+) cell HABPs 11382, 11389, and 11416 or Their Anti-HABP Antibodies Inhibited EBV Invasion of CBLs—EBV was able to invade CBLs not only because the virus presence in these cells could be determined by PCR amplification of the highly specific 300-bp DNA fragment but also because anti-gp250/350 mAb 8174 (Chemicon) recognized 31.6% of EBV-treated CBLs while recognizing only 2% of EBV-nontreated CBLs by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). EBV invasion of CBLs was performed in the presence of each CR2(+) cell-HABP or anti-HABP antibody. HABPs 11381, 11388, 11394, and 11415, or their anti-HABP antibodies, did not have a significant effect on EBV invasion of CBLs, because EBV DNA was detected by PCR in these cells (Fig. 5). On the contrary, EBV invasion of CBLs in the presence of HABPs 11382, 11389, and 11416, or their anti-HABP antibodies, was significantly inhibited, because EBV DNA was not detected in these cells (Fig. 5). The aim of this work was to find gp350/220 regions involved in EBV binding to CR2(+) cells by using synthetic peptides. This approach has been used previously for defining protein regions involved in virus and host cell interactions (36Bertoni G. Kostyal D.A. Reisert P.S. Humphreys R.E. Sairenji T.

Under certain conditions electron flow through the Q-cycle is blocked at the level of a reactive intermediate in the quinol oxidase site of the enzyme, resulting in “bypass reactions,” some of which lead to superoxide production. Using analogs of the respiratory substrates ubiquinol-3 and rhodoquinol-3, we show that the relative rates of Q-cycle bypass reactions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cyt bc1 complex are highly dependent by a factor of up to 100-fold on the properties of the substrate quinol. Our results suggest that the rate of Q-cycle bypass reactions is dependent on the steady state concentration of reactive intermediates produced at the quinol oxidase site of the enzyme. We conclude that normal operation of the Q-cycle requires a fairly narrow window of redox potentials with respect to the quinol substrate to allow normal turnover of the complex while preventing potentially damaging bypass reactions.

Although the cyt bc1 complex usually conserves energy across the membrane, deleterious side reactions can occur that bypass normal electron flow in the enzyme, robbing the cell of energy and potentially producing reactive oxygen species (3Kramer D.M.

The key feature of this mechanism is the bifurcated oxidation of UQH2 at the quinol oxidase (Qo) site of the enzyme that sends one UQH2 electron to a high potential chain (composed of the Rieske 2Fe2S cluster and cyt c1), whereas the other electron reduces a low potential chain (cyt bL and bH) and is eventually recycled back into the Q pool through UQ reduction at a quinone reductase (Qi) site on the opposite side of the membrane.

Most Q-cycle bypass reactions are thought to result from the buildup of a highly reactive SQo species, although some are suggested to occur via reduced cyt bL (18Gong X. Yu L. Xia D. Yu C.A. J. Biol.

Although each of these reactions is thermodynamically favorable in comparison to the Q-cycle, they are typically not detected during uninhibited turnover of the complex, leading to the hypothesis that the cyt bc1 complex has evolved a mechanism to steer its reactive intermediate toward productive, rather than harmful, reactions. Several variants of the Q-cycle have been proposed to explain the prevention of bypass reactions, most of which impart strict constraints on the chemical and thermodynamic properties of the substrate QH2 and its proposed initial oxidation product, SQo (6Osyczka A.

We suggest that both these factors tailor QH2 oxidation in the Qo site to minimize the concentration of reactive intermediates that can participate in these bypass reactions, which can be achieved through the use of a substrate whose oxidation results in a less reducing redox poise in the Qo site (i.e. by preventing the accumulation of either SQo or reduced cyt bL). In this work we use synthetic analogues of the quinone substrates UQ and rhodoquinone (RQ (2), see Fig. 1) to test boundary conditions on how the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of the substrate and its associated SQ stability influence the rate of Q-cycle bypass reactions.

This alternative electron transport chain is used during anoxia to maintain cellular redox balance by using fumarate as a terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen.

This occurs even under aerobic conditions where biosynthesis of RQ is down-regulated but not entirely absent, providing the potential for the interaction of RQ or RQH2 with the cyt bc1 complex. The use of the synthetic substrates ubiquinone-3 (UQ3) and rhodoquinone-3 (RQ3), where n = 3 isoprene units (instead of 9 or 10 in the natural substrates), allow us to probe the Q-cycle and bypass reactions as well as to measure the relevant redox potentials of the electrochemical couples involved in these reactions. From these results we predict the potential impact due to bypass of the Q-cycle in organisms that contain a mixed UQ/RQ pool (32Hoffmeister M. van der Klei A.

Chemicals for RQ3 Synthesis—All reactions were performed under a positive pressure of Ar with minimal exposure to light. Diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, hexanes, methanol, and tetrahydrofuran were purchased from Fisher (ACS-certified grade). Tetrahydrofuran was distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl, and methanol was dried over 3-Å molecular sieves. Mesyl chloride, sodium azide, sodium sulfate, triethylamine, and triphenylphosphine were purchased from Aldrich. Thin layer chromatography was performed on Whatman (F254) 0.25-mm coated silica gel plates and visualized using 254-nm light or by heating samples with vanillin stain. Column chromatography was carried out using 230–245 mesh silica gel from Bodman Scientific. 5-Farnesyl-2-mesyl-3-methoxy-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (4)—Demethylubiquinone-3 (3, 200 mg, 0.54 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 ml) and cooled to -20 °C before treating with triethylamine (0.082 ml, 0.59 mmol). The color of the solution changed from red to purple upon deprotonation. Mesyl chloride (0.046 ml, 0.59 mmol) was then added dropwise, and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. By thin layer chromatography, the reaction was complete after 3 h (3, Rf = 0.5; 4, Rf = 0.8 in 6:4 hexanes:ethyl acetate). The reaction was quenched with H2O (5 ml) and extracted three times with diethyl ether (Et2O, 15 ml total). The organic layers were combined and rinsed with brine (10 ml). The organic layers were dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo to yield compound 4, a yellow solid (162 mg, 73% yield). 4: 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.05 (m, 2H), 4.89 (t, 1H, J = 6.9 Hz), 4.20 (s, 3H), 3.47 (s, 3H), 3.19 (d, 2H, J = 7.1 Hz), 1.97 (s, 3H), 1.83 (m, 8H), 1.62 (m, 12H); 13C NMR (75 MHz, CDCl3): 182.6, 182.4, 149.0, 142.3, 139.5, 138.2, 135.3, 132.6, 131.3, 124.3, 123.8, 118.2, 61.5, 40.4, 39.7, 29.7, 26.7, 26.4, 25.7, 25.5, 17.6, 16.3, 16.0, 12.0; IR (thin film on NaCl): 2924, 2853, 1670, 1654, 1615, 1448, 1371, 1262, 1176, 970, 789 cm-1.

The solution turned from a reddish-orange color to a reddish-brown color after 5 min. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h before quenching with H2O (5 ml). The mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate (15 ml total), and the organic layers were washed with brine (10 ml), dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatography (9:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate) afforded 5, a reddish-orange solid (58 mg, 33% yield).

The solution immediately turned dark purple, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with H2O (2 ml), and a standard ethyl acetate/brine work-up was performed to provide 6.

Purification of the Cyt bc1 Complex—Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cyt bc1 complex was isolated from store-bought bakers' yeast using the protocol of Ljungdahl et al. (49Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with modifications (4Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The concentration of the cyt bc1 complex was determined by the ferricyanide-ascorbate-dithionite absorbance difference spectra using published values of the extinction coefficients (49Ljungdahl P.O. Pennoyer J.D. Robertson D.E. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Steady State Turnover Measurements—Steady state turnover was measured after the reduction of cyt c using an extinction coefficient of 17 mm-1 cm-1 for the 550-nm - 542-nm difference absorption (3Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Just before measurement, synthetic substrate, Q3H2 (UQ3H2 or RQ3H2), was mixed in a cuvette containing 50 μm cyt c and 1 mm NaN3 in reaction buffer (50 mm MOPS, 50 mm Tricine, and 100 mm KCl at pH 8.0). In previous work (3Kramer D.M. Roberts A.G. Muller F. Cape J. Bowman M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 382: 21-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) we used only MOPS as a buffer but have now included Tricine to ensure a high buffering capacity in the pH range 8.0 and above; this additional component did not cause any measurable changes in the activity of the complex. Cyt bc1 (1–3 nm) was added and mixed in the cuvette after collection of 20 s of background cyt c reduction. Turnover numbers were calculated by subtracting the background cyt c reduction rate from the initial rate observed after the addition of cyt bc1. Measurement of Q-cycle bypass reactions under partially inhibited conditions was performed by the addition of 30 μm antimycin-A (AA) to the cuvette before Q3H2 addition and mixing. Cyt bc1 (20–40 nm) was used for bypass reaction measurements involving UQ3H2 due to the very low rate of this reaction (1–5 s-1). All experiments were repeated once with the addition of stigmatellin as a control, which completely abolished activity in all cases. Measurement of Superoxide Production—Under partially inhibited conditions, i.e. conditions where AA blocks reduction of Q at the Qi site, the intermediate SQo can reduce oxygen to superoxide, which then reduces cyt c directly in a diffusion-limited reaction (4Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate of superoxide production from the Qo site can be determined by taking the difference in rates of AA-resistant cyt c reduction with and without added manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD). In most cases the addition of SOD inhibits the rate of cyt c reduction by 25–50%; the residual non-SOD-inhibitable cyt c reduction is caused by other Q-cycle bypass reactions such as the direct reduction of cyt c by SQo or double reduction of the high potential chain (4Muller F. Crofts A.R. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7866-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A typical superoxide production assay measuring cyt c reduction was performed by the addition of 300 units of manganese SOD to the steady state assay mixture described above. The Extent of Cyt b Reduction in the Steady State—Measurement of the reduction state of both cyt b hemes during steady state turnover was performed by mixing 30 μm Q3H2 into a cuvette containing 265 nm cyt bc1 and 5 μm cyt c. The low concentration of cyt c was used to slow depletion of the substrate through normal turnover and background cyt c reduction, which allowed us to observe steady state turnover of the complex over a timescale of minutes. The reaction was followed using the 561-nm minus 578-nm wavelength pair using an extinction coefficient of 26 mm-1 cm-1 for total cyt b. Saturating concentrations of AA and stigmatellin were added as needed. Sodium azide was omitted from the assay medium to allow re-oxidation of cyt c by the cyt c oxidase, which is a trace impurity in our preparations of cyt bc1 complex. The reduction state of the cyt c pool was measured optically to verify that the complex had actually reached the steady state. Re-oxidation of reduced cyt c after an initial spike in the concentration (up to 300 nm) brought the steady state reduced cyt c concentration to ∼60 nm. Over this time, the extent of cyt b reduction was nearly constant after the initial increase in reduction, suggesting rapid establishment of steady state conditions in the low potential chain. Cyclic Voltammetry and Determination of Redox Potentials—Voltammetric measurements of the Q/QH2 and Q/Q⋅¯? couples for UQ3 and RQ3 were performed in aqueous solution under an Ar atmosphere at 23 °C using a BAS C50-W potentiostat with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, glassy carbon working electrode, and Pt wire auxiliary electrode. The working electrode was washed with dilute H2SO4, repeatedly rinsed with distilled water, and then polished with alumina before all measurements. Determination of E(Q/Q⋅¯) was performed in unbuffered solution (100 mm KCl) as described in Shim and Park (50Shim Y.B. Park S.M. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1997; 425: 201-207Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar) at pH > 5.0. Aqueous E(Q/Q⋅¯) values were determined at several pH values above pH 5.0 to ensure that the E½ and ΔE values were independent of pH and, thus, reflect a pure electron transfer process. The two-electron Q/QH2 potential was measured in 50 mm phosphate, 100 mm KCl buffer at pH 7.0. E½ values for each couple were taken as the average of the cathodic and anodic peaks at half height. All potentials given in the text are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode. We used experimentally determined values for the Q/Q⋅¯ and Q/QH2 couples of UQ3 and RQ3 in aqueous solution to estimate reasonable values of the aqueous stability constant, KS, and Em values for the various redox couples contributing to KS, according to Equation 1 (51Roginsky V.A.

However, the mechanism of atRA-mediated regulation of IFNγ signaling is poorly understood. In this study, we have used the human lung epithelial cell line A549 to examine the effect of atRA on IFNγ-induced expression of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), an important transcription factor involved in cell growth and apoptosis, differentiation, and antiviral and antibacterial immune responses. At least 4 h of pretreatment with atRA followed by suboptimal concentrations of IFNγ induced a faster, higher, and more stable expression of IRF-1 than IFNγ alone. Actinomycin D completely blocked the induction of IRF-1 by the combination, suggesting regulation at the transcriptional level. Further, we found that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 was induced more dramatically by atRA and IFNγ than by IFNγ alone. Expression of IFNγ receptor-1 on the cell surface was also increased upon atRA pretreatment. Experiments using receptor-selective retinoids revealed that ligands for retinoic acid receptor-α (RARα), including atRA, 9-cis-retinoic acid, and Am580, sequentially increased the levels of IFNγ receptor-1, activated signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, and IRF-1 and that an RARα antagonist was able to inhibit the effects of atRA and Am580. In addition, atRA pretreatment affected the transcriptional functions of IFNγ-induced IRF-1, increasing its nuclear localization and DNA binding activity as well as the transcript levels of IRF-1 target genes. These results suggest that atRA, an RARα ligand, regulates IFNγ-induced IRF-1 by affecting multiple components of the IFNγ signaling pathway, from the plasma membrane to the nuclear transcription factors."

Previous studies showed that expression of the immediate early gene tis7 is markedly up-regulated in intestinal enterocytes during the adaptive response. To study its role in the enterocyte, transgenic mice were generated that specifically overexpress TIS7 in the gut. Nucleotides -596 to +21 of the rat liver fatty acid-binding protein promoter were used to direct abundant overexpression of TIS7 into small intestinal upper crypt and villus enterocytes. TIS7 transgenic mice had increased total body adiposity and decreased lean muscle mass compared with normal littermates. Oxygen consumption levels, body weight, surface area, and small bowel weight were decreased. On a high fat diet, transgenic mice exhibited a more rapid and proportionately greater gain in body weight with persistently elevated total body adiposity and increased hepatic fat accumulation. Bolus fat feeding resulted in a greater increase in serum triglyceride levels and an accelerated appearance of enterocytic, lamina propria, and hepatic fat. Changes in fat homeostasis were linked to increased expression of genes involved in enterocytic triglyceride metabolism and changes in growth with decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 expression. Thus, TIS7 overexpression in the intestine altered growth, metabolic rate, adiposity, and intestinal triglyceride absorption. These results suggest that TIS7 is a unique mediator of nutrient absorptive and metabolic adaptation following gut resection. Following loss of functional small bowel surface area due to surgical resection, the remnant gut undergoes an adaptive response characterized by increased crypt cell proliferation and enhanced villus height and crypt depth, resulting in augmented intestinal nutrient absorptive capacity.

Thus, TIS7 overexpression in the intestine altered growth, metabolic rate, adiposity, and intestinal triglyceride absorption. These results suggest that TIS7 is a unique mediator of nutrient absorptive and metabolic adaptation following gut resection. The small intestine contains a dynamic epithelium that can rapidly adapt to changes in its luminal environment. Following loss of functional small bowel surface area resulting from small bowel resection, crypt cell proliferation is stimulated in the remnant gut, and this contributes to an adaptive response characterized by enhanced villus height and crypt depth and increased nutrient absorptive capacity. To identify the mechanisms responsible for adaptation, we cloned intestinal genes that are differentially expressed in a rat small bowel resection model of adaptation (1Dodson B.D. Wang J.L. Swietlicki E.A. Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G347-G356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine tis7 (homologous to rat PC4) was one of several genes that showed increased mRNA expression in the remnant small bowel during the intestinal adaptive response following surgical resection in rodents. The TIS7/PC4 orthologue is expressed in the adapting gut in upper crypt and villus-associated small bowel enterocytes (2Rubin D.C. Swietlicki E.A. Wang J.L. Levin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G506-G513PubMed Google Scholar). The tis7/PC4 orthologue is an immediate early gene that is up-regulated in response to growth factors (3Tirone F. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4Herschman H.R. Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Ma Q. Varnum B.C. Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

It encodes a plasma membrane-bound protein that translocates to the nucleus upon growth factor stimulation (6Guardavaccaro D. Montagnoli A. Ciotti M.T. Gatti A. Lotti L. Di Lazzaro C. Torrisi M.R.

We have shown previously that its expression increases in intestinal epithelial cells in response to a variety of growth factors, including glucagon-like peptide 2 and epidermal growth factor (8Swietlicki E.

TIS7 has been shown in cultured cells to function as a transcriptional co-regulator (7Vietor I. Vadivelu S.K. Wick N. Hoffman R. Cotten M. Seiser C. Fialka I. Wunderlich W. Haase A. Korinkova G.

By 24 months of age, these mice have significantly decreased body weight due, at least in part, to decreased skeletal muscle mass. No specific intestinal or other phenotype was noted, but intestinal morphology and response to injury and/or resection were not examined. To investigate the role of TIS7 in the normal and adapting murine intestine, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress this gene in enterocytes of the small intestine and colon, thus mimicking the pattern of gene expression seen during adaptation to resection. We used promoter sequences from the rat liver fatty acid-binding protein gene (Fabpl-596 to +21) to direct high levels of target gene expression to the crypt and villus epithelium of the proximal small bowel with lower levels of transgene expression in the distal small bowel and proximal colonic epithelium (11Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stappenbeck T.S. Gordon J.I. Development. 2000; 127: 2629-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stappenbeck T.S. Gordon J.I. Development. 2001; 128: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TIS7 transgenic mice exhibited a distinct phenotype. As early as postnatal day 4, they weighed less than wild type littermates. By 1 month, they exhibited decreased total body surface area but had increased adiposity and decreased lean body mass. TIS7 overexpression also decreased small bowel length and villus height. Despite these changes, triglyceride absorption was enhanced in the transgenic gut, and following small bowel resection, the transgenic mice exhibited an intact morphologic adaptive response. Our data indicate that TIS7, induced in the gut epithelium in response to nutrient stress and deprivation, has direct effects on enterocytic fat absorption and thus acts to enhance functional adaptation following resection. These results also suggest that modulation of fat metabolism in the gut can affect whole body metabolic rate and adiposity/obesity. FVB/N mice were housed in Washington University School of Medicine animal facilities and were maintained on a strict 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle. Animals were fed a standard rodent chow diet (Picolab 20, Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO) containing 4.5, 20.0, and 36.8 g/100 g from fat, protein, and carbohydrate, respectively) except as described below for the fat feeding and small intestinal resection experiments. The Animal Studies Committee of the Washington University School of Medicine approved all animal experimentation. Mice were sacrificed at various time points; small intestines were collected, rinsed, and weighed; and length was measured by suspension with a fixed weight. Intestines were then divided into four segments including duodenum, proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, and ileum. All other organs were harvested and weighed. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein isolation and placed in optimal cutting temperature solution and in formalin for histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis. Nucleotides -596 to +21 of the liver fatty acid-binding protein (Fabpl) gene (a gift of Jeffrey Gordon, Washington University) were utilized to direct abundant expression of TIS7 into the crypt and villus epithelial cells of rodent small intestine (11Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fabpl-596 to +21 was fused to the full-length mouse tis7 cDNA generated by RT 4The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcription; GH, growth hormone; hGH, human growth hormone; DEXA, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; WT, wild type; TG, transgenic; NS, non-significant; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; MTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. -PCR of mouse intestinal RNA (Fig. 1A). The tis7 cDNA sequence was confirmed by automated sequencing analysis performed by the Protein Chemistry Facility of Washington University School of Medicine. The full-length cDNA was inserted into the BamHI site of the vector pLPNDon. Twenty spacer nucleotides were placed between the Fabpl promoter and the ATG of tis7 to ensure efficient transcription. In addition, nucleotides +3 to +2150 of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene were linked to the 3′ end of tis7 cDNA to ensure appropriate processing of the transgenic mRNA. The insertion of three termination codons between the tis7 cDNA and hGH+3 to +2150 sequences and the lack of an initiation codon and internal ribosomal reentry site in the hGH+3 to +2150 sequence prevents translation of hGH transcripts. The transgene was excised from the vector by NotI/SalI digestion, and the purified construct was injected into the pronuclei of FVB/N oocytes, courtesy of the Animal Models Core of the Digestive Diseases Research Core Center. Four transgenic founders were generated, and experiments were performed using two independent transgenic lines derived from two founders (lines 2412 and 2454). The presence of the transgene was determined by RT-PCR of tail genomic DNA to detect a portion of the hGH gene. The forward 5′ hGH oligonucleotide primer is 5′-CTG CAC CAG CTG GCG TTT GAC ACC TAC CAG-3′. The reverse 3′ hGH oligo primer is 5′-TTT CTG TTG TGT TTC CTC CCT GTT GGA GGG-3′. RT-PCR was performed using KlenTaq LA polymerase. For analysis of growth rates, transgenic mice and their normal littermates were weighed every 2-3 days after birth. Body composition analyses were performed on anesthetized mice by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using a small animal densitometer (PIXImus, Lunar Instruments, Fitchburg, WI) as described in Ref. 14Bernal-Mizrachi C.

Quantitative Food Consumption Study—Mice from both transgenic lines 2412 and 2454 and normal littermates were caged individually in metabolic cages containing inserts that permit collection of wasted food. Six-week-old and 2-month-old transgenic mice and wild type littermates were studied. The quantity of food ingested per mouse was measured every 2 days for 10-14 days (n = 4 per group). High Fat Feeding Experiment: Chronic—Transgenic mice and normal littermates were maintained for 14 days on a synthetic, high fat diet (21% (w/w) with 42% of total calories from fat; Adjusted Calories Diet TD 88137, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Mice were weighed on days 2, 5, 10, and 14 after beginning the high fat diet and sacrificed on day 14 (n = 4 per group for males and females). Livers and intestines were harvested for Oil Red O staining. Intestinal Triglyceride Absorption in Vivo: Acute High Fat Feeding— Experiments were performed as described previously (16Narisawa S. Huang L. Iwasaki A. Hasegawa H. Alpers D.H. Millan J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7525-7530Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice and normal littermates were fasted overnight, and serum was removed for fasting triglyceride and free fatty acid levels. Mice received a bolus (500 μl by gavage) of corn oil and were sacrificed at either 1 h (wild type (WT), n = 4; transgenic (TG), n = 3)or 3 h (WT, n = 5; TG, n = 3) after gavage feeding. Serum triglyceride, free fatty acid, and cholesterol levels were measured, and tissues were harvested for histochemical analysis. Routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, Oil Red O staining to detect fat, and electron microscopy were performed. Mice were caged individually in metabolic cages with inserts that permit collection and prevent ingestion of fecal material. Mice were maintained either on a normal chow diet or high fat diet for 14 days, and feces were collected every 2 days. Fecal fat was quantified by extraction with 2:1 chloroform:methanol according to Ref. 17Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Bjorkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

An end-toend anastomosis was formed between the remnant jejunum and ileum using 9-0 silk sutures. All animals received gentamicin (0.2 mg in 0.5 ml of saline intraperitoneally) and buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg subcutaneously) for analgesia. Mice were sacrificed 2 weeks postoperatively under isoflurane anesthesia by cervical dislocation. The remnant intestines were divided into duodenal-jejunal and ileal segments and were either fixed in formalin or frozen in optimal cutting temperature solution for histochemical and immunohistochemical analysis or placed into liquid nitrogen for RNA and protein isolation. All histologic studies were performed in the Morphology Core of the Digestive Diseases Research Core Center. Oil Red O stains were performed on cryostat sections of flash frozen tissues as described previously (19Tang Y. Swartz-Basile D.A. Swietlicki E.A. Yi L. Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Routine hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues for morphometric analyses (2Rubin D.C. Swietlicki E.A. Wang J.L. Levin M.S. Am. J.

Villus heights, crypt depths, and crypt cell numbers were measured in all intestinal segments in at least 10 well oriented, full-length crypt-villus units. Morphometry was performed by AxioVision analysis of digitally acquired images (Zeiss, version 2.0). Crypt cell proliferation was measured by 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into DNA. Mice were injected subcutaneously with a solution of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (8 g/liter) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (0.8 g/liter; total dose, 120 mg/kg) and were sacrificed 90 min after injection. 5-BrdUrd was detected with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and streptavidin-biotin amplification. Crypt cell proliferation is expressed as the percentage of labeled cells per full-length crypt (number of labeled cells divided by the total number of cells per crypt). Only full-length crypts were evaluated. Quantification of apoptotic cell index was performed by morphologic assessment of tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin (19Tang Y. Swartz-Basile D.A. Swietlicki E.A. Yi L. Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. Gastroenterology. 2004; 126: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The number of apoptotic cells per crypt and per 1000 crypt cells was measured. In the acute fat feeding experiments, intestines were fixed at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer and were sequentially stained with osmium tetroxide, tannic acid, and uranyl acetate; then dehydrated; and embedded in Polybed 812. Samples were thin sectioned on a Reichert-Jung Ultra-Cut, poststained in 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed on a Zeiss 902 electron microscope. Photographs were recorded with Eastman Kodak Co. electron microscope film. Hepatic lipids were extracted by homogenizing 100-400 mg wet weight of liver in 1.5-2.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and adding 0.1% sulfuric acid as well as 5 ml chloroform:methanol (2:1). The organic phase was collected and treated with chloroform containing 1% Triton X-100 in a glass tube, which was then vortexed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Triglyceride and cholesterol content were assessed according to Ref. 21Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar. Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined using Cholesterol E and L-type TG-H kits, respectively, and serum free fatty acids were determined using the NEFA C kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). Serum levels of mouse growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin, leptin, and glucagon were measured by Ani Lytics, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Serum for growth hormone levels was collected strictly between 8:00 and 8:30 a.m. For immunoblots, a rabbit polyclonal anti-TIS7 antibody was prepared. TIS7 protein was expressed and purified using the IMPACT-CN system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The mouse tis7 cDNA was subcloned into the pTYB2 vector and expressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 cells. The intein-TIS7 fusion protein was purified after loading onto a chitin bead column followed by cleavage with dithiothreitol. TIS7 protein was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to check for the adequacy of purification. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to mouse TIS7 protein was generated by BioDesign (Saco, ME). Intestinal extracts were prepared, and protein aliquots were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride plus membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-TIS7 antibody (1:2000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (1:10,000, Amersham Biosciences) and developed with chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate (ECL Western blotting kit, Amersham Biosciences). For Northern blot hybridization, RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and run on agarose gels. Nylon transfer membranes were probed with a radiolabeled [α-32P]dCTP cDNA probe (RediPrime II, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were visualized either by exposure of Kodak Biomax MS film or by using an Amersham Biosciences phosphor screen analyzed with Amersham Biosciences software. Total RNA from duodenum, proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, ileum, and liver was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNAs were treated with DNase I using the DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamer primers (Invitrogen). Real time PCR analysis was performed on an SDS 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 2× Sybr Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotide primers were chosen using the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). Primers used in quantitative RT-PCR are as follows: TIS7: forward, 5′-CGC TGT CTG AAA AAA GGA AAG AGT-3′; and reverse, 5′-GGC CCA GCT GAA TAC AAA GAA C-3′; IGF-I: exon 1 forward, 5′-GAT GGG GAA AAT CAG CAG CC-3′; exon 2 forward, 5′-TGC TGT GTA AAC GAC CCG-3′; and common reverse, 5′-CAA CAC TCA TCC ACA ATG CC-3′; apolipoprotein A-IV: forward, 5′-CAA TGC CAA GGA GGC TGT AGA-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGT TTG TCC TTG AAG AGG GTA CTG-3′; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1: forward, 5′-TCC GCC TCT GGG CAT TC-3′; and reverse, 5′-GAA TCG GCC CAC AAT CCA-3′; diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2: forward, 5′-AGA ACC GCA AAG GCT TTG TG-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGG AAT AAG TGG GAA CCA GAT CAG-3′; microsomal triglyceride transfer protein: forward, 5′-AAG ACA GCG TGG GCT ACA AAA-3′; and reverse, 5′-TCA TCA TCA CCA TCA GGA TTC C-3′; intestinal fatty acid-binding protein: forward, 5′-ACT AAT CCA GAC CTA CAC ATA TGA AGG A-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCT CCA GGC TCT GAG AAG TTG A-3′; liver fatty acid-binding protein: forward, 5′-GAA CTT CTC CGG CAA GTA CCA A-3′; and reverse, 5′-GTC CTC GGG CAG ACC TAT TG-3′; cellular retinol-binding protein 2: forward, 5′-ACA TGA AGG CCC TAG ATA TTG ATT TT-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGT GAT GAT CTT CGT CTG AGT CAG A-3′; sodium/glucose cotransporter 1: forward, 5′-CAC CAT CTT GAT CAT CTC CTT CCT-3′; and reverse, 5′-TGC GAT GAC TCC AAC ACA AAC G-3′; and 18 S ribosomal RNA: forward, 5′-CGG CTA CCA CAT CCA AGG AA-3′; and reverse, 5′-GCT GGA ATT ACC GCG GCT-3′. For all primer sets, the kinetics of the PCR was confirmed by serial dilutions of different cDNA preparations. These analyses verified that the efficiencies of amplification were equal for both primer sets, thereby allowing quantification by the comparative Ct method (User Bulletin Number 2, Applied Biosystems). Means were compared between normal and transgenic mice using a Student's t test. Values in the text are means ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Generation and Analysis of Transgenic Mice with Intestine-specific Overexpression of TIS7—Transgenic mice were generated that specifically overexpress TIS7 in the intestine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TIS7 transgenic mRNA levels in gut and other organs were quantified by Northern blot hybridization and quantitative real time RT-PCR assays, and TIS7 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. Hybridization of total RNA with tis7-specific cDNA probes detected transcripts of sizes varying from 2.3 to ∼4.3 kb in the intestines of transgenic mice, whereas native tis7 mRNAs of 2.3 kb were detected in wild type mice as expected (Fig. 1B). Several higher molecular weight tis7 transcripts were produced by alternative splicing of hGH as found for other transgenic mouse constructs utilizing the hGH gene to ensure appropriate RNA processing. 5T. Simon, personal communication. Intestines of transgenic animals typically presented a cephalocaudal gradient of TIS7 expression; steady state mRNA levels were increased in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum compared with wild type littermates with the greatest increase in expression in duodenum (Fig. 1C). tis7 protein levels were also detected in the small intestine of transgenic mice (Fig. 1D). As reported in other transgenic animals containing this promoter, expression in the liver was increased (11Simon T.C. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18345-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we found increased liver expression in only one of the two transgenic lines examined. The phenotype of the mice was the same in both lines irrespective of the liver expression. All experiments described below were performed in both lines. Expression was not increased in the kidney, and tis7 mRNA levels were unchanged in transgenic compared with wild type mice in various other non-digestive organs, including heart, lung, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, and brain (data not shown). Reduced Body Weight and Small Bowel Weight and Increased Adiposity in TIS7 Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice appeared healthy without excess mortality for up to 1 year of observation. However, TIS7 overexpression resulted in several phenotypic changes. Small bowel weight was significantly reduced in TIS7 mice compared with normal littermates, but the weights of other organs were unchanged (Fig. 2A). TIS7 transgenic mice showed reduced total body weight from postnatal day 4 through the suckling-weaning transition and into adulthood (Fig. 2, B and C; representative growth curves for males and females from individual litters). Both male and female mice showed body weight differences beginning shortly after birth. Analysis of mice aged 120 days revealed that the weight differences remained constant for males and females (data not shown). To further evaluate the difference in body weight, food consumption was quantified, organs were harvested and weighed, DEXA analyses were performed to determine body composition, and oxygen consumption was measured to determine basal metabolic rates. To examine the temporal regulation of the phenotypic changes in relation to growth, 6-week-, 2-3-month-, and 9-month-old mice were studied. There were no significant differences in consumption of a normal chow diet measured for 10-14 days in 6-8-week-(data not shown) or 2.5-3-month-old male and female transgenic and wild type mice (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly dual energy x-ray absorptiometry showed that although the TIS7 mice weighed less and had decreased body surface area, they had a higher percentage of body fat and reduced lean body mass compared with wild type littermates (Fig. 2E and TABLE ONE). Body composition was significantly different as early as 6 weeks after birth and became even more apparent by 3 months after birth (Fig. 2E and TABLE ONE). The percentage of body fat mass was increased in both male and female transgenic mice (e.g. at 3 months, 16 versus 25% for wild type and transgenic mice, respectively). There was no significant difference related to gender in fat mass in normal or transgenic mice at the ages examined (data not shown). To determine the phenotype in aged mice, DEXA was performed at 270 days; body surface area remained reduced (7.66 versus 9.85 cm2, p < 0.000001), yet adiposity was further increased (35 versus 22%, p < 0.00001), and as a result, weights were no longer significantly different. The calculated body mass indices for these aged mice (measured as g/cm2) were 3.89 for TG mice and 3.14 for wild type mice.TABLE ONEBody composition and oxygen consumption measurements in 3-month-old wild type control and TIS7 transgenic mice Body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. n = 13-15 control or transgenic mice per group.

Significant increase in gene delivery efficiencies has thus been obtained by using endosome-disrupting multiple histidine functionalities in the molecular architecture of various cationic polymers. To take advantage of this unique feature, we have incorporated L-histidine (N,N-di-n-hexadecylamine) ethylamide (LH) in the membrane of hepatocyte-specific Sendai virosomes containing only the fusion protein (F-virosomes (Process for Producing a Targeted Gene (Sarkar, D.

Completion and annotation of the human genome sequence has significantly enhanced the possibility of using designer DNA for gene therapy. Nonetheless, in spite of the first gene therapy trial 14 years ago, and numerous clinical trials thereafter, successful gene therapy remains elusive. The three main hurdles of widespread belief have been bolstered as (i) delivery, (ii) delivery, and (iii) delivery (1Luo D. Trends Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 101-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It turns out that the most up-hill task toward ensuring clinical success of gene therapy is to design safe, efficacious and target-specific transfection vectors. Toward designing such gene carriers, significant progress has been made on gene transfection by novel non-glycerol-based histidylated cationic amphiphiles, presumably via the endosome-disrupting properties of the histidine functionalities (2Kumar V.V. Pichon C. Refregiers M. Guerin B. Midoux P. Chaudhuri A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1206-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Histidine residues in amphipathic peptide antibiotics are also known to promote efficient DNA delivery into mammalian cells in vitro by favoring endosomal escape of the DNA molecules at low pH (3Kichler A. Leborgne C. März J. Danos O. Bechinger B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1564-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Complexes of recombinant adenoviruses and cationic lipids/polymers have been tested for the enhancement of therapeutic index for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (4Fasbender A. Zabner J. Chillón M.

The beneficial role of such complexes was clearly envisaged by the amplification of binding and entry of adenovirus particles into host cells. However, despite all these encouraging results, its failure in targeted gene transfer in whole animal and inherent cytopathic/cytotoxic side effects limit its applications in liver gene therapy (5Cavazzana-Calvo M. Thrasher A. Mavilio F. Nature. 2004; 427: 779-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because liver is an ideal organ for somatic gene delivery as well as the therapeutic target for hepatic diseases (6Yamada T. Iwasaki Y. Tada H. Iwabuki H. Chuah M.K. VandenDriessche T. Fukuda H.

Patent 5,683,866Google Scholar) efficient in transferring foreign genes into human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2) in culture and mouse/rat hepatocytes in vivo. F-virosomes exploit the membrane fusogenic property of Sendai virus F glycoprotein and the high affinity terminal β-galactose-containing ligands (present on F glycoproteins) for the asialoglycoprotein receptors on the hepatocyte surface (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon tight binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptors, F-virosomes undergo fusion both at the level of plasma membrane and endosomal membrane followed by receptor-mediated endocytosis and deliver the entrapped molecules into the cytosol (8Bagai S. Sarkar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1966-1972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ramani K. Bora R.S. Kumar M. Tyagi S.K. Sarkar D.P.

We also observed that fusion efficiency of Sendai virus F protein is much reduced in the absence of its native attachment glycoprotein, hemagglutinin neuraminidase (HN) (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome such impediments, we tested the efficacy of histidine functionality in disrupting endosomes. Thus, we have incorporated LH molecules in the F-virosomal membrane and systematically assessed its ability to enhance the binding and fusion with the target cells (cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver) as monitored by transgene expression. We report for the first time that histidine functionality of a cationic amphiphile specifically enhances F glycoprotein-induced membrane fusion and results in efficient gene delivery. 5Patent applied. 5Patent applied. The possible mechanisms of LH-induced activation of F-virosome-target membrane fusion have also been investigated.

Pichon C. Refregiers M. Guerin B. Midoux P. Chaudhuri A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1206-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, DPBS, fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody against GFP was procured from BD Bioscience Clontech. VITROGEN® was purchased from COHESION Technologies Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Other reagents used were also of the highest grade commercially available. Sendai virus (Z strain) and influenza virus X:31 (A/Aichi/68;H3N2) were grown in the allantoic sac of 10–11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was harvested and purified following standard procedures (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicular stomatitis virus (Indiana) was grown on monolayer cultures of baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and purified as described elsewhere (11Paternostre M.-T. Lowy R.J. Blumenthal R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (human hepatoblastoma cell line) and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were grown as described earlier (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh red blood cells were prepared from healthy Swiss albino mice in accordance with the norms of the Animal Ethics Committee, University of Delhi South Campus laws and regulations. F-virosomes were prepared following published/patented procedures. Cationic amphiphiles (LH and LC) were incorporated in reconstituted viral membrane as described earlier for making NBD-PE-labeled virosomes (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the LH and LC compounds dissolved in solvents (chloroform:methanol, 2:1, v/v) were dried in a glass vial separately under nitrogen to form a thin film. The supernatant from the detergent extract of pure Sendai virus (50 mg of protein), containing only the viral F protein and the lipids, was added to the respective LH and LC films and incubated at 20 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. The detergent was removed by SM2 Bio-Beads to form the virosomes. The amount of amphiphiles incorporated into the virosomal membranes (LHFV and LCFV) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography after purifying the virosomal preparations through a continuous sucrose gradient as described elsewhere (12Hsu M. Scheid A. Choppin P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3557-3563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NBD-PE-labeled influenza virosomes (HA containing virosomes) with LH and LC were made according to earlier protocols with modifications as above (13Bagai S. Sarkar D.P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Similarly, labeled vesicular stomatitis virus virosomes (GV) with LH and LC were prepared following a published procedure (11Paternostre M.-T. Lowy R.J. Blumenthal R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, isolated using a Qiagen Megaprep unit) coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter and RITC-lysozyme were entrapped in various virosomal preparations following our patented protocol (8Bagai S.

Guerin B. Midoux P. Chaudhuri A. Gene Ther. 2003; 10: 1206-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The virosome preparations were passed through 26-gauge needle 20 times and their particle size analyzed by a Photon Correlation Spectrometer (photon correlation spectrometry model: Photocor FC) using the software Flexcor/DynaLS provided by the Photocor company. The system was calibrated using 200-nm silica/latex particles (supplied by Photocor FC). Trypsinization, limited proteolysis by proteinase K, heat treatment (56 °C for 30 min), and DNase I digestion of virosome samples were carried as described elsewhere (8Bagai S. Sarkar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1966-1972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ramani K. Bora R.S. Kumar M. Tyagi S.K. Sarkar D.P.

Hemolysis and lipid mixing (fluorescence dequenching of NBD-PE) assay for virosome-cell fusion were carried out as described earlier (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of NBD-PE-labeled virosomes and fusion-mediated delivery of RITC-lysozyme to the target cells were performed following our published protocol (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bagai S. Sarkar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1966-1972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted cytosolic delivery of pEGFP-N1 DNA to HepG2 cells in culture was essentially carried out as described elsewhere (9Ramani K. Bora R.S. Kumar M. Tyagi S.K. Sarkar D.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For fusion-mediated delivery (of entrapped RITC-lysozyme and DNA) experiments to target cells in culture with bafilomycin A1 (175 nm, a potent inhibitor of endosome acidification), the drug was mixed with loaded virosomes after dilution with the medium. The gene expression was assessed by recording EGFP fluorescence in a Nikon Eclipse TE 300 epifluorescent microscope attached to a digital camera (Digital sight DS-5M). For immunofluorescence studies, cells were washed with PBS twice and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 0.5 m NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min. The cells were blocked in 5% fetal bovine serum containing PBS at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with anti-GFP A.v. monoclonal antibody (JL-8) overnight at 4 °C followed by washing with PBS and incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma). The cells were then visualized in a Nikon microscope for fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence as above. In a parallel assay, cell extracts were processed for evaluation of EGFP expression by Western analysis using the ECL detection system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and also by fluorometric quantitation (15Dandekar D.H. Kumar M. Ladha J.S. Ganesh K.N. Mitra D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Total DNA/RNA isolation and PCR/RT-PCR amplification from the cells in culture were performed as described below for in vivo studies with mice. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times. Twelve-week-old female Balb/c mice (∼18 g) were injected intravenously into the tail vein (in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee, University of Delhi South Campus), with DNA-loaded virosomes (0.8 mg F protein containing 4 μg of pEGFP-N1) in a final volume of 0.2 ml of DPBS containing 2 mm Ca2+. Injection of the equivalent amount of free DNA and heat-treated loaded virosomes in DPBS served as appropriate controls. After 2 days post-injection, parenchymal cell types (hepatocytes) were isolated as described in an earlier report by a member of our group (10Ramani K. Hassan Q. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Sarkar D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11886-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and plated on 12-well plastic plates (Falcon®, BD Biosciences) coated with VITROGEN® as per their protocol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Following incubation in CO2 for 24 h, plates were examined for EGFP expression as described above. The genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted by standard procedures (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and subjected to PCR amplification/RT-PCR of the EGFP gene (transcripts). (i) PCR Amplification of EGFP Gene—Total genomic DNA isolation from hepatocytes was done using TRIzol. The primer set designed for EGFP amplification included the following: sense, 5′-TGACCCTGAAGTTCATCTGCACCA-3′; antisense, 5′-TTGATGCCGTTCTTCTGCTTGTCG-3′. PCR amplification was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with a cycling profile of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, for 30 cycles, and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min (same in the case of β-actin primers, Stratagene). A specific amplified product of 361 bp of the EGFP gene was visualized by ethidium bromide staining on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane. As a control, the β-actin gene was also amplified and a product of 650 bp was obtained. Southern hybridization was performed to further confirm the specificity of the PCR products using a 720-bp NotI/HindIII EGFP gene fragment derived from the plasmid pEGFP-N1, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (by the random primer-labeling technique). (ii) RT-PCR Amplification of EGFP Gene-specific Transcript—Total hepatic RNA from various mice or from HepG2 cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). DNase I (Invitrogen)-treated RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript RNase H- RT (Invitrogen) and gene-specific antisense primer as per the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification (30 cycles) of the RT product was performed using high-fidelity Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with a cycling profile as mentioned before. The amplified product of 361 bp of the EGFP gene was visualized by ethidium bromide staining on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to nylon membrane and subsequently Southern hybridized. As a control, β-actin mRNA was also amplified by RT-PCR for each sample and a product of 650 bp was obtained. Following intravenous (tail vein) injection (0.8 mg of F protein containing 4 μg of plasmid DNA) of various pBVluc (containing the firefly luciferase gene under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter as described earlier by Ramani et al. (10Ramani K. Hassan Q. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Sarkar D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cells were washed twice with Tricine-buffered saline and suspended in the same. For luciferase assay, the Triton X-100-solubilized cell lysate (from 1 × 107 cells) was mixed with luciferase assay buffer containing 1 mm luciferin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Luciferase activity (in mV) was measured in a 1250 Luminometer (BIO-Orbit, Finland) as described earlier (10Ramani K. Hassan Q. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Sarkar D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11886-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Four groups of mice (three mouse per group) were injected (0.8 mg of F protein containing 4 μg of plasmid DNA) with various pEGFP-N1-loaded virosomes (FV, LCFV, LHFV, and LHFV(H)). After 6 months a portion of each liver from the injected mice was immediately fixed in Bouins fixative and dehydrated through graded alcohol and xylene followed by embedding in paraffin wax. Such embedded tissues were cut into 5-μm sections, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. For immunostaining, sections were washed in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Subsequently, sections were incubated with EGFP-specific monoclonal antibody (JL-8) for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG at 37 °C for 1 h. All antibody dilutions were made in 1.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Following extensive washes with PBS, the slides were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin, washed in distilled water, and mounted in glycerol. The specificity of immunostaining was verified by the use of PBS in place of primary antibody (data not shown). The sections were examined using fluorescence microscopy (Nikon fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set) and photographed (magnification, ×20). The CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco (J-715) spectropolarimeter fitted with a Peltier-based temperature controller (PTC-43). The instrument was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid. Subsequently, the spectral measurements of the virosome samples (0.04 mg/ml F protein in LHFV and LCFV samples) were made using a 0.2-cm path-length cell at room temperature with constant purging of nitrogen. Each protein sample was subjected to 30 scans to obtain the final spectrum. The respective buffer baseline was subtracted from the spectra of the protein samples and data were presented as ellipticity expressed in millidegree. Fusion of F-virosomes with Target Cell Membrane Is Enhanced by Histidylated Cationic Lipid—To evaluate the particle size, virosomal preparations were subjected to photon correlation spectrometry measurements. It revealed the mean diameter of FVs to be 181 nm, which conforms well to the average size reported earlier by transmission electron microscopy (17Bagai S. Sarkar D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), on the other hand, LHFV and LCFV preparations were found to be 298 and 232 nm, respectively (data not shown). ξ potential measurements of these virosomes reflected net negative charge for FV and net positive charge for both LHFV and LCFV. The membrane fusion activity of F protein in FV is well correlated with its ability to hemolyse various RBCs upon WGA-mediated binding of F protein to cell surface sugar molecules (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to begin with mouse, RBC was chosen as appropriate target cells with a view to check and compare the efficiency of membrane fusion by various virosomal preparations in the presence of WGA. As shown in Fig. 2a, various doses of LH molecules significantly enhanced the hemolytic activity of LHFVs. With 2 mg, LH incorporated into 50 mg of total Sendai virus protein resulted in a 4-fold increase in hemolytic activity. The specificity of the effect of LH was established by parallel control with LC (having the same amount of positively charged head group but lacks histidine moiety, Fig. 1), which did not affect hemolysis over FVs alone. Strikingly, same amount of LH in LH/CHOL liposomes mixed with FVs did not affect hemolysis over FVs alone. HNFVs, containing HN that markedly enhances its lytic activity (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), served as a positive control, and incorporation of LH and LC molecules in HNFVs did not enhance the hemolytic activity any further. Similar results were also obtained with RBCs from human and rabbit (data not shown). The high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the sucrose density gradient-purified virosomes showed 85% efficiency of incorporation using 2 mg of LH against 50 mg of Sendai virus (Fig. 2a, inset). The gradient purification of virosomes (12Hsu M. Scheid A. Choppin P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3557-3563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) ensured the co-grafting of LH and LC molecules with F protein in the viral membrane. Similar profile of incorporation (and size) was also obtained with HA containing virosomes and GV (data not shown). The incorporation profile of LC in FVs followed the same trend (data not shown). Calculations based on the protein/lipid composition of virosomes, molecular weights of F (HA and G) and cationic lipids, about 60 molecules LH (and LC), were estimated to be associated with one molecule of F (HA and G) protein in the respective virosomal membranes (having 2 mg of LH with 50 mg of Sendai, influenza, and vesicular stomatitis virus). All further experiments were performed at this stoichiometry. NBD-PE-labeled FVs, LHFVs, and LCFVs, containing equivalent amounts of F protein of identical electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2b), had equal affinity for mouse RBCs and HepG2 cells but showed negligible attachments to HeLa cells at 4 °C (Fig. 2, c and d). Because our main goal is to demonstrate targeted gene delivery in liver cells using LH-modified FVs, HepG2 cells are included at this point as the only target cells of choice (7Bagai S. Puri A. Blumenthal R. Sarkar D.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3312-3318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to establish the role of LH molecules in enhancing membrane fusion induced by F protein in culture conditions. HeLa cells are taken as negative controls to reveal the binding specificity of the terminal β-galactose moieties of F protein to the asialoglycoprotein receptors on the hepatocyte cell surface. As shown in Fig. 2e, the presence of LH in the viral membrane markedly enhanced the kinetics (∼8-fold increase) as well as the extent of hemolysis. LH/cholesterol liposomes mixed with FVs failed to exert such an effect. Fluorescent micrographs showing escalated movement of NBD-PE (dequenching of fluorescence) from LHFVs to mouse RBCs indicated membrane fusion (compare panels A and B with C in Fig. 3) and the transfer of RITC-lysozyme from loaded virosomes to an increased number (about 2-fold) of HepG2 cells (compare panel 1 and 2 with 3 in Fig. 4a) indicated core mixing.

https://openalex.org/W1994066895,"The yeast exocytic SNARE complex consists of one molecule each of the Sso1/2 target SNAREs, Snc1/2 vesicular SNAREs, and the Sec9 target SNARE, which form a fusion complex that is conserved in evolution. Another protein, Sec1, binds to the SNARE complex to facilitate assembly. We show that Mso1, a Sec1-interacting protein, also binds to the SNARE complex and plays a role in mediating Sec1 functions. Like Sec1, Mso1 bound to SNAREs in cells containing SNARE complexes (i.e. wild-type, sec1-1, and sec18-1 cells), but not in cells in which complex formation is inhibited (i.e. sec4-8 cells). Nevertheless, Mso1 remained associated with Sec1 even in sec4-8 cells, indicating that they act as a pair. Mso1 localized primarily to the plasma membrane of the bud when SNARE complex formation was not impaired but was mostly in the cytoplasm when assembly was prevented. Genetic studies suggest that Mso1 enhances Sec1 function while attenuating Sec4 GTPase function. This dual action may impart temporal regulation between Sec4 turnoff and Sec1-mediated SNARE assembly. Notably, a small region at the C terminus of Mso1 is conserved in the mammalian Munc13/Mint proteins and is necessary for proper membrane localization. Overexpression of Mso1 lacking this domain (Mso1-(1–193)) inhibited the growth of cells bearing an attenuated Sec4 GTPase.

SNAREs are membrane-associated proteins bearing α-helical domains (termed SNARE motifs) that can assemble into intermolecular four-helix bundles (1Fasshauer D. Biochim. Biophys.

Assembly of the SNARE complex, which is composed of vesicular (v) and target (t) SNAREs (or R- and Q-SNAREs, depending upon the nomenclature followed), bridges apposed bilayers and allows for the extrusion of interposed water molecules, resulting in membrane fusion.

At the level of exocytosis, these include the Rab family of small GTPases; the vesicle-tethering exocyst complex; the Sec1/Munc18 family of SNARE assembly factors, which are conserved from yeast to mammals; and the complexin, Mint, Munc13, and synaptotagmin families of SNARE regulators, which appear to act only upon stimulus-coupled exocytic processes (7Gerst J.E.

In yeast, the exocytic SNARE complex consists of one representative molecule each of the Sso1/2 t-SNAREs (Q-SNARE) (11Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and Snc1/2 v-SNAREs (R-SNARE) (12Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) as well as one molecule of the Sec9 t-SNARE (Q-SNARE) (13Brennwald P. Kearns B. Champion K. Keranen S. Bankaitis V. Novick P. Cell. 1994; 79: 245-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, all Q-SNARE complexes composed either of a mutated Snc v-SNARE and one molecule each of Sso and Sec9 (14Katz L. Brennwald P. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) have also been shown to be functional and to confer exocytosis. In addition, Sec1, a conserved regulator of the Sso/syntaxin t-SNAREs, is known to bind to the assembled SNARE complex and may play a definitive role in facilitating assembly (17Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sec1 in yeast is known to interact with Mso1, a protein of unknown function that is not essential for membrane fusion, but in its absence, has defects in secretion and accumulates secretory vesicles (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the functions of neither Munc13 (or the related Mint proteins) in mammals nor Mso1 in yeast have been fully resolved, these proteins are known to interact with Sec1/Munc18 (20Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Biederer T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Mso1 is functionally related to Munc13/Mint, we examined the genetic and physical interactions of Mso1 with components of the yeast exocytic SNARE complex. We found that Mso1 bound to the SNARE complex in cells that can assemble or accumulate such complexes (i.e. wild-type, sec1-1, sec9-7, and sec18-1 cells), but not in cells in which complex formation is inhibited (i.e. sec4-8 cells). In contrast, Mso1 binding to Sec1 was not affected under these conditions, indicating that it is a partner of Sec1 whether or not Sec1 is bound to the SNARE complex. Thus, Sec1 and Mso1 constitute a functional pair that confers exocytosis in yeast. Mso1 localizes to the plasma membrane in a manner sensitive to mutations that affect SNARE complex assembly and requires a domain from the C terminus that is conserved in the Munc13 and Mint proteins from higher organisms (22Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31459-31464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24Koch H. Hofmann K. Brose N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These and other results suggest that Mso1 is functionally homologous to the Munc13/Mint proteins. In addition, we propose that it helps bridge the connection between Sec4 function and SNARE assembly via the recruitment and release of Sec1 from the SNARE complex. Media, DNA, and Genetic Manipulations—Yeast cells were grown in standard growth medium containing either 2% glucose or 3.5% galactose. The preparation of synthetic complete and dropout media was similar to that described previously (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). Standard methods were used for the introduction of DNA into yeast and the preparation of genomic DNA (25Rose M.D. Winston F.

Growth Tests—Yeast cells were grown on synthetic and rich growth media (25Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual.

For growth tests on plates, yeast cells were grown to mid-log phase, normalized for absorbance at 600 nm, diluted serially, and plated by drops onto solid medium preincubated at different temperatures.

A plasmid expressing HA-tagged Sso1 was described previously (16Marash M. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing HA-tagged Mso1 was created by amplifying MSO1 by PCR from genomic DNA using oligonucleotides bearing SalI and SmaI sites, respectively, and cloning into the same sites of pAD54 to yield pADH-HAMSO1. This construct lacks the initial two methionines of Mso1 and utilizes the initiator methionine preceding the HA epitope. A plasmid expressing HA-tagged Sec1 was created in a similar fashion to yield pADH-HASEC1. A single-copy plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Mso1 under the control of the inducible MET25 promoter was created by amplifying MSO1 plus 536 bp of its 3′-untranslated region by PCR using oligonucleotides bearing SpeI and ClaI sites, respectively, and cloning into the same sites in pUG36 (26Longtine M.S.

C-terminal truncation mutants of Mso1 (Mso1-(1–193)) were created in pADH-HAMSO1 and pMET-GFPMSO1 by mutagenesis with Pfu polymerase using the appropriate oligonucleotides to yield pADH-HAMSO1-(1–193) and pMET-GFPMSO1-(1–193). A plasmid containing monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) in pGEM (Clontech), pmRFP-SalI, was created by PCR using oligonucleotides bearing SalI sites and an mRFP template obtained from R. Tsien (University of California, San Diego, CA). Next, a SalI-SalI mRFP fragment (lacking the start and stop codons) was cloned in-frame into the SalI site of pADH-HAcSNC1, yielding pADH-HAmRFPcSNC1. pADH-HAcSNC1 was created by PCR using pADH-cSNC1 (27Gerst J.E.

Yeast cells were grown to log phase on selective synthetic medium containing methionine and then transferred to medium lacking methionine for 2 h prior to visualization to induce expression from the MET25 promoter. For temperature-sensitive strains, cells were either maintained at 26 °C or shifted to 37 °C for an additional 45 min. Immunoprecipitation of SNARE Complexes from Cell Lysates— SNARE complexes present in cell lysates were monitored by immunoprecipitation of SNAREs from cell extracts as described (28Couve A. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23391-23394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the following additions to the lysis and immunoprecipitation buffers were made: 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (instead of Triton X-100); MG132 (100 μm), ATPγS (20 μm), EDTA (2 mm), and N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm) to inhibit SNARE complex dissociation and degradation (16Marash M. Gerst J.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for immunoprecipitation (4 μl/reaction) and detection (1:1000 dilution). Polyclonal antibodies against Sec9 (gift of P. Brennwald, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC); Mso1, Sso1, Sec4, and Sec1 (gifts of S. Keranen, VTT Technical Research Centre, Espoo, Finland); Sed5 and Tlg1 (gifts of H. Pelham, Medical Research Council, London, UK); and Snc1 (12Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies against the HA epitope (gift of M. Wigler, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) were used for detection. Samples of total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by electrophoresis and detected by Western blotting. Detection was performed by chemiluminescence (ECL). MSO1 Overexpression Rescues sec1-1 Cells but Inhibits the Growth of Late sec Mutants—Yeast MSO1 was characterized earlier as a multicopy suppressor of defects in the yeast SEC1 gene (i.e. sec1-1 cells) (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MSO1 rescues cells bearing mutations in SEC1 at restrictive temperatures, whereas its deletion in the sec1-1, sec2-41, and sec4-8 mutant backgrounds leads to synthetic lethality. In other late-acting sec mutants, the deletion of MSO1 leads to reduction in cell growth (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggests that Mso1 acts to confer exocytosis and, in particular, may enhance the functioning of Sec1. Indeed, Mso1 was found to bind to Sec1 using the yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting a physical interaction that may be meaningful in regulating SNARE assembly (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because the function of Mso1 is still unknown, we further examined its ability to interact with components of the SNARE complex. First, we performed multicopy suppression assays with other late-acting sec mutants (Fig. 1). We found that overexpression of HA-MSO1 rescued sec1-1 cells at restrictive temperatures (Fig. 1A), as previously demonstrated (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that HA-MSO1 overexpression inhibited growth of the sec4-8, sec8-9, and sec15-2 mutants, which act upstream of SNARE assembly, at both permissive and semirestrictive temperatures (Fig. 1B). SEC4 encodes the Rab GTPase necessary to activate vesicle tethering and docking, and both SEC8 and SEC15 encode components of the exocyst that acts as the downstream effector for Sec4 (19Aalto M.K.

This interesting dichotomy suggests that Mso1 may have two functions, one to enhance the functioning of Sec1 and a second perhaps to attenuate Sec4. MSO1 overexpression also inhibited the growth of yeast with mutations in other proteins that function in the late secretory pathway (Fig. 1B), such as sec18-1 cells, which are defective in SNARE complex disassembly (34Grote E. Carr C.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); sso2-1 cells, which bear a temperature-sensitive Sso2 t-SNARE (11Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); and sncΔ cells, which lack the Snc1/2 exocytic and endocytic v-SNAREs (12Protopopov V. Govindan B. Novick P. Gerst J.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 855-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 35Gurunathan S. Chapman-Shimshoni D. Trajkovic S. Gerst J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3629-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of sncΔ cells, growth inhibition upon MSO1 overexpression was observed only on glucose-containing medium, which prevents expression of a plasmid-borne copy of SNC1 that is under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. When SNC1 was induced in these cells, however, no deleterious effect on growth was seen (Fig. 1B). We note that the inhibitory effects of MSO1 overexpression were seen in these late sec mutants primarily at permissive or subpermissive temperatures, although sec9-7 cells, which may be blocked in the trans-SNARE complex (36Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Brennwald P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), were found to be inhibited at elevated temperatures. In contrast to the effects on the late sec mutants, MSO1 overexpression had little to no effect on wild-type cells or early mutants of the secretory pathway (i.e. sec23-2 and sec31-1 cells) under the same conditions (Fig. 1, A and C). Thus, MSO1 overexpression preferentially inhibits the growth of late-acting mutants of the secretory pathway. Similar to the effects seen with MSO1 overexpression in the different sec mutants, we found that overexpression of Myc-SEC1 also had deleterious effects on the growth of sec4-8, sec8-9, and sec15-2 cells, but not the other mutants tested (Fig. 1B). In contrast, we note that myc-SEC1 overexpression mildly rescued the growth of sso2-1 cells at elevated temperatures (Fig. 1B), implying a positive role in restoring SNARE assembly and exocytosis therein. The parallel effect of MSO1 and SEC1 overexpression on Sec4 and the Sec4 effector pathway suggests a common mode of action for Mso1 and Sec1 in exocytosis. As Sec1 is likely to act downstream of Sec4 (34Grote E. Carr C.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), deficiencies in Sec4 GTPase function appear to hinder Sec1. Mso1 Is a Component of the Exocytic SNARE Complex—Recent studies have suggested that proteins of the Sec1/Munc18 family facilitate SNARE assembly at the level of the Golgi (37Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), endosomes (39Bryant N.J. James D.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3380-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and plasma membrane (17Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in yeast and are components of the assembled SNARE complex. This suggested to us that Mso1 might be a component of the complex, particularly if it acts to stimulate Sec1 function, as might be predicted from the genetic studies (Fig. 1A) (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we expressed HA-tagged Mso1 in wild-type cells and various secretion mutants (i.e. sec1-1, sec4-8, sec9-7, and sec18-1 cells) and examined its ability to precipitate Sec1 and components of the exocytic apparatus (Fig. 2, A and B). We found that Sec1 was able to coprecipitate with HA-Mso1 from lysates derived from wild-type cells grown at permissive and elevated temperatures (Fig. 2A), as shown previously (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notable, we found that v- and t-SNAREs of the exocytic complex (i.e. Sso1/2, Sec9, and Snc1/2) also co-immunoprecipitated with Mso1 in a specific fashion (Fig. 2A). No precipitation of Sec4 was observed in these immunoblots, suggesting that Mso1 does not stably associate with this small GTPase in wild-type yeast. Nevertheless, these results show that Mso1 is a likely component of the exocytic SNARE complex. Mutations in components of the secretory apparatus often increase or decrease the stability of SNARE complexes at non-permissive temperatures. To verify that Mso1 is a component of the exocytic SNARE complex, we examined whether Sec1 and SNAREs interact with HA-Mso1 in yeast secretion mutants by co-immunoprecipitation. At permissive temperatures, we found that both Sec1 and the exocytic t-SNAREs co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Mso1 from cells known to accumulate SNARE complexes (Fig. 2B, upper panel), such as sec1-1 and sec9-7 cells, which are defective in fusion (17Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 36Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. Brennwald P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and sec18-1 cells, which are defective in the AAA-ATPase that disassembles cis-SNARE complexes (40Sogaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Sollner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these SNAREs could not be co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Mso1 from lysates derived from sec4-8 cells, which are defective in their ability to assemble SNARE complexes (34Grote E. Carr C.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite this, the Mso1-Sec1 interaction remained intact in these cells. Thus, even at temperatures permissive for growth, the Mso1-SNARE interaction, but not the Mso1-Sec1 interaction, is inhibited in cells bearing an attenuated allele of Sec4. We found similar results when examining sec mutants that were shifted to the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The exocytic t-SNAREs were still complexed with HA-Mso1 in lysates derived from sec1-1, sec9-7, and sec18-1 cells. In contrast, HA-Mso1 was unable to precipitate these SNAREs from lysates derived from sec4-8 cells (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Thus, normal Sec4 function is necessary to recruit Mso1-Sec1 to the SNARE complex. We note that the amount of Sso1 that coprecipitated with Mso1 was consistently reduced in the sec9-7 background (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating a possible defect in SNARE complex assembly or stability in this background. We also note that some Sso was observed to precipitate with Mso1 in sec4-8 cells at 26 °C (Fig. 2B, upper panel); however, this was not consistently observed (lower panel). Thus, although Sec1 has also been shown to bind to monomeric Sso in vitro (18Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Mso1 does not seem able to readily precipitate uncomplexed Sso from cell lysates (this study and Ref. 17Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Given that Mso1 and Sec1 form a stable complex in wild-type cells and late sec mutants (Fig. 2, A and B) (19Aalto M.K. Jantti J. Ostling J. Keranen S. Ronne H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7331-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that Sec1 function is required to facilitate assembly of the exocytic SNARE complex (17Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Scott B.L. Van Komen J.S. Irshad H. Liu S. Wilson K.A. McNew J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we examined whether Sec1 can interact with the Sec9 and Sso t-SNAREs in cells lacking MSO1 (Fig. 2C). We immunoprecipitated HA-Sso1 from cells lacking MSO1 (e.g. mso1Δ cells) and found that both Sec9 and Sec1 could still co-immunoprecipitate in a specific fashion. Thus, Mso1 is not absolutely required for SNARE assembly or for the association of Sec1 with the SNARE complex. Finally, we examined whether the interaction of Mso1-Sec1 with the v- and t-SNAREs of the exocytic complex is specific. We immunoprecipitated HA-Mso1 from wild-type cells and probed the precipitates with antibodies against the Sed5 Golgi t-SNARE (41Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Cro"

Previous studies have shown that v-src stimulates basal transcription of bsp in osteosarcoma (ROS 17/2.8) cells by targeting the inverted CCAAT element (ICE) in the proximal promoter. To identify possible downstream effectors of Src we studied the effects of the proto-oncogene c-jun, which functions downstream of Src, on basal transcription of bsp using transient transfection assays. Increased expression of endogenous c-Jun induced by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate and ectopic expression of c-Jun increased basal transcription of chimeric reporter constructs encompassing the proximal promoter by 1.5–3-fold in ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells, with more modest effects in a normal bone cell line, RBMC-D8. The effects of c-Jun were abrogated by mutations in the ICE box and by co-expression of dominant negative nuclear factor Y, subunit A (NF-YA). The increase in bsp transcription did not require phosphorylation of c-Jun and was not altered by trichostatin treatment or by ectopic expression of p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) or mutated forms lacking histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. Similarly, ectopic expression of p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF), which transduces p300/CBP effects, or of HAT-defective P/CAF did not influence the c-jun effects. Surprisingly, E1A, which competes with P/CAF binding to p300/CBP, also stimulated BSP transcription through NF-Y independently of c-jun, p300/CBP, and P/CAF. Collectively, these studies show that c-Jun and E1A regulate basal transcription of bsp in osteosarcoma cells by recruiting the NF-Y transcriptional complex to the ICE box in a mechanism that is independent of p300/CBP and P/CAF HAT activities.

Kim R.H. Sodek J. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Although the expression of BSP is essentially restricted to mineralizing connective tissues, it is also expressed in various pathologies in which ectopic mineralization occurs. The involvement of BSP in physiological and pathological mineralization can be attributed to its ability to bind to collagen (2.Tye C.E. Hunter G.K. Goldberg H.A. J. Biol.

Although the mineral binding properties of BSP could also be involved in the formation of bone metastases, BSP has been shown to promote angiogenesis (6.Bellahcene A. Bonjean K. Fohr B. Fedarko N.S.

Recent studies have also reported that BSP can increase the invasive potential of metastatic cells by activating proMMP-2 (8.Fedarko N.S. Jain A. Karadag A. Fisher L.W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).Studies on the transcriptional regulation of bsp have identified a highly conserved proximal promoter region in which an inverted CCAAT element (ICE) and TATAA box are separated by 21 nucleotides (9.Sodek J. Li J.J. Kim R.H. Ogata Y. Yamauchi M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition to its critical role in basal transcription, the ICE is a target of src regulation through nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) (10.Kim R.H. Sodek J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). NF-Y comprises three subunits (A, B, and C), each having the DNA-binding domain required for CCAAT binding and transactivation. Subunits B and C form a stable dimer through interaction between complementary histone fold motifs. The dimer offers a complex surface for NF-YA association with co-activators. Subunits A and C also contain conserved Q-rich domains that have a transcriptional activation function (11.Bellorini M. Lee D.K. Dantonel J.C. Zemzoumi K. Roeder R.G. Tora L. Mantovani R.

Because p300/CBP also binds P/CAF, which interacts with TFIID, a complex of these proteins has been suggested as transactivating NF-Y-mediated transcription in the proximal promoter of the human ferritin H gene (14.Faniello M.C.

The AP-1 complex regulates gene transcription of specific target genes in a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, stress response, and tumorigenicity by binding to a specific nucleotide sequence known as the AP-1 element. However, c-jun can also regulate transcription by interactions with other transcription factors including Sp1 (16.Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol.

Ogata Y. Kim R. Li J. Freedman L. Sodek J. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, suppressed transcription was not observed in short constructs. Because c-jun functions downstream of c-src, we studied the effects of c-jun on basal transcription of bsp and show that c-jun stimulates BSP transcription by recruitment of NF-Y to the ICE box independent of DNA binding. In contrast to other studies (14.Faniello M.C. Chirico G. Quaresima B. Cuda G. Allevato G. Bevilacqua M.A. Baudi F. Colantuoni V. Cimino F. Venuta S. Avvedimento V.E. Costanzo F. Biochem.

Both ROS 17/2.8 cells (provided by Dr. Gideon Rodan, Merck-Frost, Philadelphia, PA) and the clonal osteogenic rat bone marrow cell line (RBMC-D8) generated from spontaneously established rat bone marrow cells (provided by Dr. Sandu Pitaru, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel) were grown in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 300 μg/ml Fungizone).Construction of Rat bsp Promoter Constructs—Constructs of different lengths of rat bsp promoter –116/+60, –84/+60, and –60/+60, were cloned as described previously (10.Kim R.H.

Briefly, rat bsp promoter inserts –116/+60, –84/+60, and –60/+60 were blunt end-ligated into the SmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega Life Science, Madison, WI). Constructs of single point-mutated CCAAT box (ptTTGG) and reverted (rvt) CCAAT box (prvtCCAAT) were cloned based on –60/+60 using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primer sets used for cloning ptTTGG were 5′-GTGACCGTGTTTGGCTGCTGAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGTGCGACGTCAGGCTGT-3′, and those used for cloning prvtCCAAT were 5′-CCGGCCGTGACCGTGGCCAATTGCTGAGAGGAGAAGAAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTCTTCTCCTCTCAGCAATTGGCCACGGTCACGGCCGG-3′ (the sequences of mutated and reverted CCAAT boxes are underlined).

Jun Ala, a c-Jun expression vector in which the serines and threonines targeted for phosphorylation were mutated to alanines (28.Weiss C. Schneider S. Wagner E.F. Zhang X. Seto E. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3686-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. D. Bohmann (Department of Biomedical Genetics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY).The E1A expression vector pCMX-Flag Ad5 13S was generously provided by Dr. J. S. Mymryk (London Regional Cancer Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). Expression vector pCMV5-E1A was a gift from Dr. L. Penn (Dept. of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto). The first Met was deleted in pCMV5-E1A; thus, the translation practically starts from amino acid 15, which is the first Met in the sequence. PCMV5-E1A is thus termed as E1A(–15) in this study. E1A+ was constructed by PCR using pCMV5-E1A as template. The primers used were 5′-CGGGATCCGAAAATGAGACATATTATCTGCCACGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAATTCCTTGGCCTGGGGCGTTTACAGCTCAAGTC-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and then phosphorylated and inserted in-frame into pCMV5Tag4B at the BamHI/EcoRI site. E1A+(–25), in which amino acids 4 –25 were deleted, was cloned in the same way except that the forward primer used was 5′-CGGGATCCGAAAATGAGACATGAGGTACTGGCTGATAAT-3′. pE1A cDNA, in which the 116-nucleotide intron sequence between amino acids 185 and 186 in pCMV5-E1A is deleted, was cloned by the following steps. First, E1A+ was digested with PpuMI. Then the 5-kb product was dephosphorylated and ligated with the phosphorylated double-stranded oligonucleotides 5′-GACCCAGATATTATGTGTTCGCTTTGCTATATGAGGACCTGTGGCATGTTTGTCTACA-3′ and 5′-GACTGTAGACAAACATGCCACAGGTCCTCATATAGCAAAGCGAACACATAATATCTGG-3′ (both from Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). pE1A cDNA(–25) was constructed in the same way, except that the starting plasmid was E1A+(–25).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts used for electrophoretic mobility shift assays were prepared from ROS 17/2.8 cells as described (10.Kim R.H. Sodek J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 565-571PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the nuclear extract were measured using the Bio-Rad assay. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were synthesized by Invitrogen. The sequences of the probes (only the sense strand is shown) are: s-CCAAT (ICE), 5′-CCGTGACCGTGATTGGCTGCTGAG-3′; rvt-CCAAT (RICE), 5′-CCGTGACCGTGCCAATCTGCTGAGAG-3′; rvt-CCAAT+f2, 5′-CCGTGACCGAGCCAATCAGCTGAGAG-3′; rvt-CCAAT+f7, 5′-CCGTTCAGCAGCCAATCACGGTCGAG-3′; and rvt-CCAAT+f10, 5′-CCTCTCAGCAGCCAATC-ACGGTCACG-3′, where f2, f7, and f10 refer to 2, 7, and 10 flanking nucleotides, respectively. The double-stranded oligos were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen). 2.5 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated with 50,000 cpm of labeled oligos at room temperature (21 °C). NF-Y binding was confirmed using antibodies to the NF-YA and NF-YB subunits (24.Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated with or without antibody at room temperature for 10 min, and then the probe was added and incubated for an additional 20 min. The ability of the different reverted constructs to bind NF-Y was determined using radiolabeled probes and to inhibit NF-Y binding to the radiolabeled s-CCAAT probe by competition assays in which a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled probes was used.Northern Hybridizations—Rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) were grown to confluence in 60-mm culture dishes. The cells were treated with either 28 μg/ml cycloheximide or a combination of cycloheximide and 100 ng/ml TPA. Using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), total RNA was extracted from triplicate dishes for each treatment at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h following the addition of the reagents. Following purification, 20 μg of total RNA from each time point was used for Northern hybridization analysis as described (29.Yao K. Todescan R.J. Sodek J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 42 °C with 32P-labeled probes to rat fos and human jun cDNA probes (generously provided by T. Curran of St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN and M. Breitman of Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, respectively). Following hybridization, membranes were washed four times for 5 min each wash at 22 °C in 2× SSC (30 mm sodium citrate and 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 0.1% SDS. This was followed by two 20-min washes at 55 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The hybridized bands were photographed from radioautographs prepared by exposure on Kodak X-Omat film at –70 °C and quantitated by Quantify One (Bio-Rad).Transcription Assays—ROS 17/2.8 and RBMC-D8 cells were plated on 24-well cell culture plates (0.4 × 105/well) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells (60% confluent) were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). A total of 1–1.5 μg DNA was used for transfection, normally 0.4 μg of bsp promoter construct (–116 bspLuc, –84 bspLuc, –60 bspLuc, tTTGGC, or rvtCCAAT), 0.4 μg of expression vector (for c-Jun, P/CAF, JNK kinase, or E1A, etc.) and, as indicated, 0.4 μg of YA DN or YA wild-type (wt) expression vector. A Renilla luciferase expression vector, phRL-SV40 (Promega), was used as an internal control (one one-thousandth of total DNA). Some cells were treated with TPA or trichostatin (TSA) (using ethanol and Me2SO as vehicle controls, respectively) 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested either 24 h after transfection or 24 h after the addition of TPA or TSA. Cell lysates were prepared with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), and luciferase was analyzed by Berthold Lumat LB-9501.siRNA—p300/CBP siRNAs were generated by cloning two pairs of siRNA oligos for p300 and two pairs of siRNA oligos for CBP (30.Liu G. Xia T. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17557-17565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), respectively, into pSilencer 3.1 H1-Hygro (Ambion, Austin, TX). A mixture of equal amounts (100 ng per siRNA per well) of the four siRNAs was used in transient transfections. The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection of the siRNAs, and the luciferase activity was analyzed.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The ChIP procedure used has been described previously (31.Mao D.Y. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Ho C.S. Watson J.D. Stojanova A. Penn L.Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3462-3468Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with –60 bspLuc construct plus control vector or E1A-expression vector, pCMX-FLAG Ad5 13S. The cells were incubated for 24 h and fixed in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde. The chromatin was extracted, sonicated, and immunoprecipitated using antibodies that recognize NF-YB (24.Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.Y. Knapp A.M. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3315-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), FLAG tag (M2, Sigma-Aldrich), and c-Jun (H-79, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The chromatin immunoprecipitate was PCR-amplified using promoter-specific primers, resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, and then visualized by UV fluorescence. The ChIP PCR primers 5′-GTGACCGTGATTGGCTGCTGAG-3′ (bsp; forward) and 5′-TTGCTCTCCAGCGGTTCCAT-3′ (Luc; reverse) generated a DNA fragment of 254 bp.Statistical Analysis—Transcription assay results depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 are from one set of experiments in triplicate that were repeated at least twice.
