https://openalex.org/W2101605059,"Blood pressure is a heritable trait1 influenced by several biological pathways and responsive to environmental stimuli. Over one billion people worldwide have hypertension (≥140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure)2. Even small increments in blood pressure are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events3. This genome-wide association study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which used a multi-stage design in 200,000 individuals of European descent, identified sixteen novel loci: six of these loci contain genes previously known or suspected to regulate blood pressure (GUCY1A3–GUCY1B3, NPR3–C5orf23, ADM, FURIN–FES, GOSR2, GNAS–EDN3); the other ten provide new clues to blood pressure physiology. A genetic risk score based on 29 genome-wide significant variants was associated with hypertension, left ventricular wall thickness, stroke and coronary artery disease, but not kidney disease or kidney function. We also observed associations with blood pressure in East Asian, South Asian and African ancestry individuals. Our findings provide new insights into the genetics and biology of blood pressure, and suggest potential novel therapeutic pathways for cardiovascular disease prevention."

https://openalex.org/W2087665466,"Osteoclasts resorb the mineralized matrices formed by chondrocytes or osteoblasts. The cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) is essential for osteoclast formation and thought to be supplied by osteoblasts or their precursors, thereby linking bone formation to resorption. However, RANKL is expressed by a variety of cell types, and it is unclear which of them are essential sources for osteoclast formation. Here we have used a mouse strain in which RANKL can be conditionally deleted and a series of Cre-deleter strains to demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes and osteocytes, both of which are embedded in matrix, are essential sources of the RANKL that controls mineralized cartilage resorption and bone remodeling, respectively. Moreover, osteocyte RANKL is responsible for the bone loss associated with unloading. Contrary to the current paradigm, RANKL produced by osteoblasts or their progenitors does not contribute to adult bone remodeling. These results suggest that the rate-limiting step of matrix resorption is controlled by cells embedded within the matrix itself."

https://openalex.org/W2104048484,"People with brain cancers called gliomas often have seizures due to secretion of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from the tumor. Now, Harald Sontheimer and his colleagues report that blockade of a cystine-glutamate transporter in tumor cells by an FDA-approved drug can reduce glioma-induced epilepsy in mice. Epileptic seizures are a common and poorly understood comorbidity for individuals with primary brain tumors. To investigate peritumoral seizure etiology, we implanted human-derived glioma cells into severe combined immunodeficient mice. Within 14–18 d, glioma-bearing mice developed spontaneous and recurring abnormal electroencephalogram events consistent with progressive epileptic activity. Acute brain slices from these mice showed marked glutamate release from the tumor mediated by the system xc− cystine-glutamate transporter (encoded by Slc7a11). Biophysical and optical recordings showed glutamatergic epileptiform hyperexcitability that spread into adjacent brain tissue. We inhibited glutamate release from the tumor and the ensuing hyperexcitability by sulfasalazine (SAS), a US Food and Drug Administration–approved drug that blocks system xc−. We found that acute administration of SAS at concentrations equivalent to those used to treat Crohn's disease in humans reduced epileptic event frequency in tumor-bearing mice compared with untreated controls. SAS should be considered as an adjuvant treatment to ameliorate peritumoral seizures associated with glioma in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2024910015,"Although the human amygdala and striatum have both been implicated in associative learning, only the striatum's contribution has been consistently computationally characterized. Using a reversal learning task, we found that amygdala blood oxygen level-dependent activity tracked associability as estimated by a computational model, and dissociated it from the striatal representation of reinforcement prediction error. These results extend the computational learning approach from striatum to amygdala, demonstrating their complementary roles in aversive learning."
https://openalex.org/W2068104262,"Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, involves specification of endothelial cells to tip cells and stalk cells, which is controlled by Notch signalling, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 and VEGFR-3 have been implicated in angiogenic sprouting. Surprisingly, we found that endothelial deletion of Vegfr3, but not VEGFR-3-blocking antibodies, postnatally led to excessive angiogenic sprouting and branching, and decreased the level of Notch signalling, indicating that VEGFR-3 possesses passive and active signalling modalities. Furthermore, macrophages expressing the VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 ligand VEGF-C localized to vessel branch points, and Vegfc heterozygous mice exhibited inefficient angiogenesis characterized by decreased vascular branching. FoxC2 is a known regulator of Notch ligand and target gene expression, and Foxc2(+/-);Vegfr3(+/-) compound heterozygosity recapitulated homozygous loss of Vegfr3. These results indicate that macrophage-derived VEGF-C activates VEGFR-3 in tip cells to reinforce Notch signalling, which contributes to the phenotypic conversion of endothelial cells at fusion points of vessel sprouts."
https://openalex.org/W2107629837,"Photoswitchable fluorescent proteins have enabled new approaches for imaging cells, but their utility has been limited either because they cannot be switched repeatedly or because the wavelengths for switching and fluorescence imaging are strictly coupled. We report a bright, monomeric, reversibly photoswitchable variant of GFP, Dreiklang, whose fluorescence excitation spectrum is decoupled from that for optical switching. Reversible on-and-off switching in living cells is accomplished at illumination wavelengths of ∼365 nm and ∼405 nm, respectively, whereas fluorescence is elicited at ∼515 nm. Mass spectrometry and high-resolution crystallographic analysis of the same protein crystal in the photoswitched on- and off-states demonstrate that switching is based on a reversible hydration/dehydration reaction that modifies the chromophore. The switching properties of Dreiklang enable far-field fluorescence nanoscopy in living mammalian cells using both a coordinate-targeted and a stochastic single molecule switching approach."
https://openalex.org/W1980546626,"Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable region exons are assembled from VH, D and JH gene segments in developing B lymphocytes. Within the 2.7-megabase mouse Igh locus, V(D)J recombination is regulated to ensure specific and diverse antibody repertoires. Here we report in mice a key Igh V(D)J recombination regulatory region, termed intergenic control region 1 (IGCR1), which lies between the VH and D clusters. Functionally, IGCR1 uses CTCF looping/insulator factor-binding elements and, correspondingly, mediates Igh loops containing distant enhancers. IGCR1 promotes normal B-cell development and balances antibody repertoires by inhibiting transcription and rearrangement of DH-proximal VH gene segments and promoting rearrangement of distal VH segments. IGCR1 maintains ordered and lineage-specific VH(D)JH recombination by suppressing VH joining to D segments not joined to JH segments, and VH to DJH joins in thymocytes, respectively. IGCR1 is also required for feedback regulation and allelic exclusion of proximal VH-to-DJH recombination. Our studies elucidate a long-sought Igh V(D)J recombination control region and indicate a new role for the generally expressed CTCF protein. The variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) is generated by selecting one segment each from the VH, D and JH loci. Many studies have proposed the existence of a control region between the VH and D loci that would regulate VH-to-D recombination, but its identity has been elusive. Frederick Alt and colleagues have now located this regulatory sequence, IGCR1 (intergenic control region 1), and show that it uses CTCF sites to promote looping and interaction with distal enhancer elements. It also suppresses other events that would disrupt the ordered rearrangement of the VH, D and JH loci."
https://openalex.org/W2085081842,"The midbody is a singular organelle formed between daughter cells during cytokinesis and required for their final separation. Midbodies persist in cells long after division as midbody derivatives (MBds), but their fate is unclear. Here we show that MBds are inherited asymmetrically by the daughter cell with the older centrosome. They selectively accumulate in stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells and potential cancer ‘stem cells’ in vivo and in vitro. MBd loss accompanies stem-cell differentiation, and involves autophagic degradation mediated by binding of the autophagic receptor NBR1 to the midbody protein CEP55. Differentiating cells and normal dividing cells do not accumulate MBds and possess high autophagic activity. Stem cells and cancer cells accumulate MBds by evading autophagosome encapsulation and exhibit low autophagic activity. MBd enrichment enhances reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells and increases the in vitro tumorigenicity of cancer cells. These results indicate unexpected roles for MBds in stem cells and cancer ‘stem cells’. Doxsey and colleagues report that midbodies accumulate in stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells and potential cancer-initiating cells. Loss of midbodies accompanies stem-cell differentiation and is mediated through binding of the autophagy receptor NBR1 to the midbody protein CEP55. Downregulation of NBR1 is associated with enrichment of midbodies, enhanced reprogramming and increased tumorigenicity in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971250890,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and RAS oncogenic signalling modules are frequently mutated in sporadic human cancer. Although each of these pathways has been shown to play critical roles in driving tumour growth and proliferation, their activation in normal human cells can also promote cell senescence. Although the mechanisms mediating RAS-induced senescence have been well characterised, those controlling PI3K/AKT-induced senescence are poorly understood. Here we show that PI3K/AKT pathway activation in response to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) knockdown, mutant PI3K, catalytic, α polypeptide (PIK3CA) or activated AKT expression, promotes accumulation of p53 and p21, increases cell size and induces senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. We demonstrate that AKT-induced senescence is p53-dependent and is characterised by mTORC1-dependent regulation of p53 translation and stabilisation of p53 protein following nucleolar localisation and inactivation of MDM2. The underlying mechanisms of RAS and AKT-induced senescence appear to be distinct, demonstrating that different mediators of senescence may be deregulated during transformation by specific oncogenes. Unlike RAS, AKT promotes rapid proliferative arrest in the absence of a hyperproliferative phase or DNA damage, indicating that inactivation of the senescence response is critical at the early stages of PI3K/AKT-driven tumourigenesis. Furthermore, our data imply that chronic activation of AKT signalling provides selective pressure for the loss of p53 function, consistent with observations that PTEN or PIK3CA mutations are significantly associated with p53 mutation in a number of human tumour types. Importantly, the demonstration that mTORC1 is an essential mediator of AKT-induced senescence raises the possibility that targeting mTORC1 in tumours with activated PI3K/AKT signalling may exert unexpected detrimental effects due to inactivation of a senescence brake on potential cancer-initiating cells."

https://openalex.org/W2150458375,"The α(7) acetylcholine receptor (AChR) mediates pre- and postsynaptic neurotransmission in the central nervous system and is a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric and inflammatory disorders. We determined the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of a receptor chimera constructed from the human α(7) AChR and Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), which shares 64% sequence identity and 71% similarity with native α(7). We also determined the structure with bound epibatidine, a potent AChR agonist. Comparison of the structures revealed molecular rearrangements and interactions that mediate agonist recognition and early steps in signal transduction in α(7) AChRs. The structures further revealed a ring of negative charge within the central vestibule, poised to contribute to cation selectivity. Structure-guided mutational studies disclosed distinctive contributions to agonist recognition and signal transduction in α(7) AChRs. The structures provide a realistic template for structure-aided drug design and for defining structure-function relationships of α(7) AChRs."

https://openalex.org/W2026324708,"We present evidence that the cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer lines, A2780S/CP1 (S/CP1), A2780S/CP3 (S/CP3) and A2780S/CP5 (S/CP5), derived by subjecting the sensitive A2780S ovarian cancer line to multiple rounds of cisplatin treatments followed by recovery and are resistant to 1, 3 and 5 μM cisplatin, respectively, have increased colony-forming ability and altered morphology that is consistent with enhanced motility, migration and invasiveness in vitro. The malignant phenotype progresses with increasing resistance and is associated with hyperactive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2 and janus kinases (Jaks), aberrant signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3 activation promoted by EGFR and Jaks, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. Survivin and FLIP anti-apoptotic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase activities are also elevated in the resistant cells. Accordingly, the ectopic expression of constitutively-active Stat3C in the sensitive A2780S cells diminished cisplatin sensitivity. The inhibition of EGFR or Stat3 activity repressed Survivin, VEGF and Vimentin expression and the colony-forming potential, viability, motility and migration of the resistant cells, and sensitized them to cisplatin. Analysis of human ovarian cancer patients’ tumor tissues shows aberrantly-active EGFR and Stat3 that in certain cases correlate with Vimentin over-expression. Intra-peritoneal mouse xenograft studies revealed, compared with the sensitive A2780S line that had low tumor incidence restricted to the ovary, a high tumor incidence for the resistant S/CP3 and S/CP5 lines that formed tumor nodules at several locations on the small intestine and colon, and which responded poorly to cisplatin, but were sensitive to concurrent treatment with cisplatin and EGFR or Stat3 inhibitor. Hyperactive EGFR signaling through Stat3 and the Jak-Stat3 activity together promote ovarian cancer progression to cisplatin resistance and therefore represent targets for preventing the development of cisplatin resistance and the recurrent disease during cisplatin therapy in ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1974426088,"Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a non-selective ion channel, which is expressed in nociceptor sensory neurons and transduces chemical, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain signals. Numerous non-reactive compounds and electrophilic compounds, such as endogenous inflammatory mediators and exogenous pungent chemicals, can activate TRPA1. Here we report a 16-Å resolution structure of purified, functional, amphipol-stabilized TRPA1 analyzed by single-particle EM. Molecular models of the N and C termini of the channel were generated using the I-TASSER protein structure prediction server and docked into the EM density to provide insight into the TRPA1 subunit organization. This structural analysis suggests a location for critical N-terminal cysteine residues involved in electrophilic activation at the interface between neighboring subunits. Our results indicate that covalent modifications within this pocket may alter interactions between subunits and promote conformational changes that lead to channel activation."
https://openalex.org/W2092974673,"The mechanism of activation of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) in the extracellular matrix remains a fundamental mystery in our understanding of the biology of this multifunctional mammalian enzyme. Earlier investigations have highlighted the role of a disulfide bond formed by vicinal Cys residues in maintaining calcium-bound TG2 in an inactive state. Here, we have shown that the redox potential of this disulfide bond is approximately -190 mV, a high value for a disulfide bond in proteins. Consistent with this observation, TG2 activity in a freshly wounded fibroblast culture depends upon the redox potential of the environment. We sought to identify a physiological mechanism for the activation of oxidized TG2. With a k(cat)/K(m) of 1.6 μm(-1) min(-1), human thioredoxin (Trx) was a highly specific activator of oxidized human TG2. Trx-mediated activation of TG2 was blocked by PX-12, a small molecule Trx inhibitor that is undergoing clinical trials as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. In a mixed culture containing fibroblasts and monocytic cells, interferon-γ stimulated Trx release from monocytes, which in turn activated TG2 around the fibroblasts. Recombinant human Trx could also activate extracellular TG2 in cryosections of human and mouse small intestinal biopsies. In addition to explaining how TG2 can be activated by dietary gluten in the small intestinal mucosa of celiac sprue patients, our findings reveal a new strategy for inhibiting the undesirable consequences of TG2 activity in this widespread, lifelong disease."
https://openalex.org/W2092515857,"Adaptation helps sensory neurons optimize in a steady environment, but can cause a failure in transmission when the environment changes suddenly. The authors report that the retina overcomes this limitation by complementing adaptation with an opposing process that sensitizes a separate population of neurons following a strong stimulus. The range of natural inputs encoded by a neuron often exceeds its dynamic range. To overcome this limitation, neural populations divide their inputs among different cell classes, as with rod and cone photoreceptors, and adapt by shifting their dynamic range. We report that the dynamic behavior of retinal ganglion cells in salamanders, mice and rabbits is divided into two opposing forms of short-term plasticity in different cell classes. One population of cells exhibited sensitization—a persistent elevated sensitivity following a strong stimulus. This newly observed dynamic behavior compensates for the information loss caused by the known process of adaptation occurring in a separate cell population. The two populations divide the dynamic range of inputs, with sensitizing cells encoding weak signals and adapting cells encoding strong signals. In the two populations, the linear, threshold and adaptive properties are linked to preserve responsiveness when stimulus statistics change, with one population maintaining the ability to respond when the other fails."
https://openalex.org/W2016202053,"Agonist-induced internalization was observed for both inducible and constitutively expressed forms of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor. These were also internalized by the peptide orexin A, which has no direct affinity for the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor, but only when the orexin OX(1) receptor was co-expressed along with the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor. This effect of orexin A was concentration-dependent and blocked by OX(1) receptor antagonists. Moreover, the ability of orexin A to internalize the CB(1) receptor was also blocked by CB(1) receptor antagonists. Remarkably, orexin A was substantially more potent in producing internalization of the CB(1) receptor than in causing internalization of the bulk OX(1) receptor population, and this was true in cells in which the CB(1) receptor was maintained at a constant level, whereas levels of OX(1) could be varied and vice versa. Both co-immunoprecipitation and cell surface, homogenous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer based on covalent labeling of N-terminal ""SNAP"" and ""CLIP"" tags present in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the receptors confirmed the capacity of these two receptors to heteromultimerize. These studies confirm the capacity of the CB(1) and OX(1) receptors to interact directly and demonstrate that this complex has unique regulatory characteristics. The higher potency of the agonist orexin A to regulate the CB(1)-OX(1) heteromer compared with the OX(1)-OX(1) homomer present in the same cells and the effects of CB(1) receptor antagonists on the function of orexin A suggest an interplay between these two systems that may modulate appetite, feeding, and wakefulness."

Mutations in the ZIC2 gene are associated with human holoprosencephaly, but the etiology is still unclear. Here, we report a novel function for ZIC2 as a regulator of β-catenin·TCF4-mediated transcription. We show that ZIC2 can bind directly to the DNA-binding high mobility group box of TCF4 via its zinc finger domain and inhibit the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin·TCF4 complex. However, the binding of TCF4 to DNA was not affected by ZIC2. Zic2 RNA injection completely inhibited β-catenin-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos and strongly blocked the ability of β-catenin to induce expression of known Wnt targets in animal caps. Moreover, Zic2 knockdown in transgenic Xenopus Wnt reporter embryos led to ectopic Wnt signaling activity mainly at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary.

A total of 5 μg of the indicated anti-TCF4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ZIC2 (Millipore, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-ZIC2 antibody generated by Dr. S. Brown) were incubated with the sheared cross-linked chromatin and BSA-blocked protein G beads. Input and immunoprecipitated DNAs were subjected to quantitative PCR using primers designed against the Tcf-bound or unbound region as a negative control as described by Mahmoudi et al. (24Mahmoudi T. Boj S.F. Hatzis P. Li V.S. Taouatas N. Vries R.G. Teunissen H. Begthel H. Korving J. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Clevers H. PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000539Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ZIC2-bound region at the ApoE promoter was described previously (25Salero E. Pérez-Sen R. Aruga J. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1881-1888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript transcriptase II (Invitrogen). The relative amount of gene transcripts was determined by real-time RT-PCR using the ABI 7500 system (Applied Biosystems). The PCR protocol was carried out as recommended by Applied Biosystems. Standard curves for targets and the housekeeping control gene were based upon the Ct (threshold cycle) values, and the relative concentrations of the standards and the relative concentrations for samples were calculated from the detected Ct values and the equation of the curves. Values obtained for targets were divided by the values of housekeeping genes to normalize for differences in reverse transcription. Genomic contamination of the samples was checked by no-amplification control samples, which did not contain reverse transcriptase enzyme during the cDNA preparation. 3The primer sequences used and real-time PCR conditions are available upon request. 293T cells were transiently transfected in duplicates or triplicates with a combination of plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The total DNA concentration for each transfection was matched with the empty vector. β-Galactosidase-expressing plasmid (20 ng/well) was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. 36 h after transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer from Promega. Luciferase reporter enzyme activity (Promega) and β-galactosidase (Applied Biosystems) assays were performed according to the manufacturers' protocol. The results are the mean of at least three experiments. Xenopus embryos were obtained from adult frogs by hormone-induced egg laying and in vitro fertilization using standard methods. Synthesis of capped RNA was performed with an mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and injection was carried out as described previously (26Bellefroid E.J. Bourguignon C. Hollemann T. Ma Q. Anderson D.J. Kintner C. Pieler T. Cell. 1996; 87: 1191-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG-ZIC2 and its truncation mutants together with pFLAG-CMV4-TCF4. After 48 h, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitor mixture and Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1 (Sigma). After sonication, the mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 for 30 min. The cell lysates were precleared on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 3 h on a rotating wheel. Meanwhile, antibody against FLAG, ZIC2 (Sigma), or TCF4 (Upstate) was coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads during incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 3 h. The precleared cell lysates were divided over the antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose beads and an equal amount of protein G-Sepharose beads coupled with IgG as a control. After several washing steps in TBS/Tween, the bound protein complexes were solubilized in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using the appropriate antibody. Different deletion peptides of ZIC2 and TCF4 were made using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The synthesized peptide was used for pulldown experiments. EMSAs were performed using the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) with slight modifications. Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extract was preincubated with 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 for 10 min at room temperature. After preincubation, the samples were either directly used in the binding assay or incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with anti-TCF4 antibody. 30 fmol of biotin-labeled probe (Eurogentec) was added in a total volume of 20 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA·protein complexes were separated from the free probes by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 4 °C. After transferring to a Hybond-C membrane (GE Healthcare), the blot was cross-linked at 120 mJ/cm2 using a Stratalinker cross-linker (Stratagene). The membrane was developed using a streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase system according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the upper strands of the oligonucleotides used were CGGGCTTTGATCTTTGCTTAA (TCF4-Wild-for) and CGGGCTTTGGCCTTTGCTTAA (TCF4-Mut-for). 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitors. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was precleared at 4 °C for 2 h with Strep-Tactin beads (IBA) and then incubated at 4 °C for 16 h with 300 ng of biotinylated double-stranded probe corresponding to the TCF4-binding sequence with wild-type sequence 5′-CGGGCTTTGATCTTTGCTTAA-3′ or mutant sequence 5′-CGGGCTTTGGCCTTTGCTTAA-3′. After several washing steps, precipitated DNA·protein complexes were analyzed by Western blotting. To determine whether ZIC2 interferes with β-catenin·TCF transcriptional activity, we studied the effect of ZIC2 on a luciferase reporter construct containing the wild-type consensus LEF/TCF-binding sites (TOPflash) or the same construct with mutant LEF/TCF-binding sites (FOPflash). ZIC2 overexpression in 293T cells, as well as in other cell lines such as Caco-2, SW480, HCT116, and DLD-1, consistently decreased the TOPflash reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas FOPflash reporter activity did not change (Fig. 1A and data not shown). ZIC2 strongly inhibited reporter activity even in the presence of excess β-catenin. In 293T cells, overexpression of a constitutively active form of β-catenin (ΔN90-β-catenin) induced TOPflash activity by 15-fold. This activation was significantly (95%) inhibited by coexpression of ZIC2 (Fig. 1B). Increasing amounts of ΔN90-β-catenin failed to abrogate the inhibition of reporter activity by ZIC2 (Fig. 1B). In addition to β-catenin activation by overexpression, ZIC2 significantly inhibited the TOPflash activity induced by LiCl treatment, which is known to stabilize endogenous β-catenin by inhibiting GSK3β activity (Fig. 1C). Together, these data show that ZIC2 overexpression is able to strongly abrogate β-catenin·TCF transcriptional activation of responsive promoters. To investigate whether the observed regulatory effect of ZIC2 on the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin·TCF complex occurs via the interaction of ZIC2 with TCF4 and/or β-catenin, we performed immunoprecipitation using 293T cells transfected with expression vectors for ZIC2, TCF4, and β-catenin. ZIC2 was able to immunoprecipitate TCF4 (Fig. 2A). However, β-catenin was co-immunoprecipitated with ZIC2 only in the presence of ectopic TCF4 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that ZIC2 binds to TCF4 but not directly to β-catenin. Next, we sought to analyze if ZIC2-mediated repression of β-catenin·TCF transcriptional activity occurs through inhibition of the binding between β-catenin and TCF4. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of ZIC2 on a chimeric protein that directly fuses the N-terminally truncated form of LEF1, which lacks the β-catenin-binding domain and the two transactivation domains, to β-cateninΔN53, which lacks the N-terminal 53 amino acids, i.e. the destabilizing region of β-catenin (22Aoki M. Hecht A. Kruse U. Kemler R. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). If ZIC2 inhibits β-catenin signaling by altering β-catenin binding to LEF/TCF, it should not inhibit the LEFΔN-β-cateninΔN53 fusion protein. The TOPflash reporter was activated by up to 6-fold after transfection with the fusion protein compared with the control, and activation of the TOPflash reporter was reduced to basal levels after ZIC2 cotransfection (Fig. 2C), suggesting that repression by ZIC2 does not rely on competition with β-catenin for LEF/TCF binding. Furthermore, to rule out any effect of ZIC2 on β-catenin protein levels, we analyzed expression of the protein in cells overexpressing ZIC2. As shown in Fig. 2D, ZIC2 overexpression decreased the level of cyclin D1 protein, a well known Wnt target, but had no effect on β-catenin protein levels, indicating that ZIC2 can inhibit a Wnt target gene and that this effect is not due to β-catenin down-regulation or degradation. In addition, ZIC2 did not change the nuclear translocation of β-catenin (data not shown). To map further the ZIC2·TCF4 interaction domains, we transfected 293T cells with a ZIC2 expression vector together with truncated forms of FLAG-tagged TCF4. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-ZIC2 antibody (Fig. 3, A–C). In this experiment, full-length TCF4 and constructs carrying the HMG domain (DN101 and DN316), as well as a deletion mutant carrying only the C-terminal domain (DN394), were found to bind ZIC2, whereas the construct lacking both the HMG domain and the C-terminal domain (DC317) failed to co-immunoprecipitate ZIC2 (Fig. 3C). We next tried to confirm these results in a cell-free system by performing an in vitro protein binding assay. In vitro translated ZIC2 was incubated with FLAG-tagged TCF4 and its truncated forms purified with anti-FLAG beads. Only proteins carrying the HMG domain (full-length TCF4, DN101, and DN316) were found to bind ZIC2 (Fig. 3D), suggesting that the HMG domain of TCF4 is essential for direct interaction. We could not confirm the interaction between the C-terminal domain of TCF4 distal to the HMG domain (DN394) and ZIC2 in vitro. This suggests that the interaction of ZIC2 with the C terminus of TCF4 relies on another protein or a post-translational modification that is present in 293T cells but not in reticulocyte lysate. Next, we generated different ZIC2 deletion constructs (Fig. 3, E–G) and evaluated the ability of the truncated ZIC2 proteins to bind TCF4. Full-length ZIC2 and truncation mutants harboring the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 were able to bind to TCF4, whereas mutants lacking the zinc finger domain failed to interact (Fig. 3G), indicating that the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 is essential for TCF4 binding. Together, these data demonstrate that ZIC2 can bind to TCF4 and that the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 and the HMG domain of TCF4 are important for this interaction. Because of the DNA-binding ability of the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 and the HMG domain of TCF4, we sought to determine whether ZIC2 binds to the TCF4 target sequence. To test this possibility, EMSA was performed using nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with ZIC2, TCF4, or TCF4 deletion mutants and incubated with a wild-type (ATCTTT) or mutant (GCCTTT) HMG consensus target sequence. ZIC2 neither bound nor changed the TCF4 binding affinity for the target sequence (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the effect of ZIC2 on the TCF4 complex is not due to inhibition of DNA binding. Only TCF4 and its mutants still harboring the HMG domain were found to specifically bind the probe (Fig. 4B). To confirm that ZIC2 was still bound to TCF4 in the presence of DNA, DNA precipitation assay was performed using DNA probes containing only consensus TCF4-binding sequences. As shown in Fig. 4C, full-length ZIC2 and TCF4 could be pulled down by the DNA probe, suggesting, first, that TCF4 can bind to the probe in the presence of ZIC2 and, second, that ZIC2 can be pulled down by the DNA via TCF4. To address whether TCF4 and ZIC2 are bound to TCF4-binding sites in vivo, we performed ChIP experiments. Using the TCF target sequence in the AXIN2 promoter as a readout in 293T cells, we could show binding of both ZIC2 and TCF4 to this region (Fig. 4D). The known binding sequence of ZIC2 for the ApoE promoter and the known binding sequence of TCF4 for the AXIN2 promoter were used as positive controls, and as a negative control, we used an unbound region of the AXIN2 promoter. ZIC2 enrichment was specific to the TCF4-bound region of AXIN2 and not the unbound downstream control region. These results together suggest that ZIC2 is likely a cofactor of the TCF4 transcriptional repression complex rather than being involved in DNA binding competition. To investigate which domains of ZIC2 contribute to TCF4 transcriptional repression, we mapped the repressor domains of ZIC2 protein using different ZIC2 deletion constructs and TOPflash as a reporter. As shown in Fig. 4E, only the constructs harboring the N-terminal domain as well as the zinc finger domain were able to repress the reporter. The repressor activity was somewhat stronger when the C-terminal tail of ZIC2 was deleted (ZIC2(1–415)). A C370S mutant, which can no longer bind DNA (27Brown L. Paraso M. Arkell R. Brown S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was still able to bind TCF4 (data not shown) and repress TOPflash reporter activity, suggesting that the DNA-binding ability of ZIC2 is not required for TCF4 repression. Collectively, these data indicate that both the zinc finger and the N-terminal domain of ZIC2 are necessary for ZIC2 inhibition of the β-catenin·TCF4 transcriptional activity and that ZIC2 DNA-binding ability is not necessary for this function. We next examined whether Zic2 inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vivo. Dorsal axis formation in Xenopus embryos is a well established model for studying regulators of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (28Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Ectopic activation of this pathway in early embryos leads to double axis formation. Injection of β-catenin RNA (100 pg) into the ventral blastomeres of eight-cell stage embryos resulted in double axis formation in 70 of 98 embryos, whereas co-injection of Zic2 RNA (500 pg) completely blocked secondary axis formation in all embryos (28 of 28) (Fig. 5B). Secondary axis induction with higher doses of β-catenin (250 pg) was still completely blocked by Zic2 co-injection (33 of 33). We further studied whether Zic2 could down-regulate canonical Wnt target genes in Xenopus animal caps. Synthetic RNA of β-catenin was injected into the four animal blastomeres of eight-cell embryos. We documented induction of target genes of the canonical Wnt pathway, such as Siamois, Xnr3, and Chordin (29Mann B. Gelos M. Siedow A. Hanski M.L. Gratchev A. Ilyas M. Bodmer W.F. Moyer M.P. Riecken E.O. Buhr H.J. Hanski C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), by RT-PCR (Fig. 5C). Co-injection of Zic2 RNA led to a strong inhibition of Siamois and Xnr3 expression, whereas the transcript levels of the control genes, XH4 and VegT, remained unaffected. Zic2(1–339), a truncated form of Zic2 lacking the C-terminal domain and the last three zinc fingers, failed to inhibit β-catenin induction of Siamois and Xnr3. We next determined whether knockdown of Zic2 would expand TOP-GFP expression in transgenic Xenopus Wnt reporter embryos. This reporter line has already been shown to faithfully illustrate domains of β-catenin activity in responsive cell populations (30Tran H.T. Sekkali B. Van Imschoot G. Janssens S. Vleminckx K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 16160-16165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we selected a transgenic line with relatively low GFP expression. To block the translation of Zic2, we injected morpholino antisense oligonucleotides targeting Zic2 as well as its corresponding control morpholino (mismatch morpholino) at the one-cell stage with 40 ng of morpholino/embryo. The Zic2 morpholino specifically blocked translation of the respective expression plasmids in reticulocyte lysates (data not shown). We examined Wnt reporter expression in late stages, focusing primarily on brain expression. Following injection of Zic2 morpholino, there was a striking increase in TOP-GFP expression in several derivatives of the CNS from the early tadpole stage (stage 35) onwards (87%, n = 15). This was particularly visible in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, but GFP expression was also increased in the forebrain, dorsal hindbrain, and eye (shown at stage 43) (Fig. 6, compare B and D). Zic2 morpholino was also injected unilaterally at the two-cell stage. To mark the injected site, a red fluorescent tracer was co-injected. Embryos injected with Zic2 morpholino on one side clearly displayed increased unilateral GFP expression combined with a reduction in eye size and a smaller cartilaginous skeleton, resulting in bending of the embryonic axis toward the injected site (Fig. 6, E and F). Interestingly, the asymmetric GFP expression was lost around stage 45, i.e. 5 days after injection. In summary, these results indicate that Zic2 is required for the repression of Wnt activity in vivo, particularly in CNS derivatives. The findings of this study highlight a novel role for ZIC2 as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling. We have shown in mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos that ZIC2 overexpression inhibits the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin·Tcf complex and down-regulates the expression of direct Wnt target genes. Previous genetic studies in Drosophila suggest that opa (odd-paired), the homolog of zic, is required upstream of Wnt signaling for activation of wg (wingless) gene expression (31Benedyk M.J. Mullen J.R. DiNardo S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, our data add new information in that we found another mechanism by which Zic regulates downstream of Wnt signaling via inhibition of β-catenin·Tcf transcriptional activity. Hence, ZIC2 has a dual effect in regulation of Wnt signaling: induction of Wnt proteins and inhibition of β-catenin·Tcf transcriptional activity. Whether these effects occur in a cell autonomous versus non-autonomous manner remains unknown. To study the interaction of ZIC2 and TCF4, because available anti-Zic2 Abs were inefficient to study the endogenous interaction by co-immunoprecipitation, we used FLAG-tagged proteins expressed in 293T cells. We found that the HMG domain of TCF4 and the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 are required for this interaction. It has been shown that the zinc finger domain of Zic proteins can also interact with DNA (32Ishiguro A. Ideta M. Mikoshiba K. Chen D.J. Aruga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9983-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); however, our data strongly suggest that inhibition of the TCF4 complex by ZIC2 is not DNA-dependent. First, in EMSA, ZIC2 neither bound to the TCF4 target sequence nor altered the TCF4 DNA-binding affinity. Second, a single mutation in the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 that results in loss of DNA-binding ability (27Brown L. Paraso M. Arkell R. Brown S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) exhibited the same repressor activity as normal ZIC2 while still binding to TCF4. These data are in agreement with previous observations in Drosophila where the sequence-specific DNA-binding ability of Opa was not required for its transcriptional activation (33Sen A. Stultz B.G. Lee H. Hursh D.A. Dev. Biol. 2010; 343: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, our ChIP results clearly confirmed that both overexpressed ZIC2 and TCF4 were localized at the TCF4 target sequence of the AXIN2 promoter, a ubiquitous Wnt target. Together, these data suggest that ZIC2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of the TCF4 complex by direct binding to TCF4 and that this function is DNA-independent. There are limited data on the proteins that bind to ZIC2. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal domain of ZIC2 interacts with I-mfa (inhibitor of MyoD family domain-containing protein) (34Mizugishi K. Hatayama M. Tohmonda T. Ogawa M. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Aruga J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been shown that I-mfa interacts with the HMG domain of Tcf3, thereby preventing the β-catenin·Tcf3 complex from binding to DNA (35Snider L. Thirlwell H. Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Groudine M. Tapscott S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1866-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Deletion of the N-terminal domain of ZIC2 including the ZOC (Zic-Opa conserved) domain, a sequence conserved between mouse Zic1–3 and fly opa and known to interact with I-mfa, results in almost complete loss of repressor activity of ZIC2, suggesting that the N-terminal domain has significant repressor activity. To what extent I-mfa proteins are required for ZIC2 inhibition of the β-catenin·TCF4 complex remains unknown, particularly because most experiments were done on whole cells in which I-mfa would have been present. Moreover, the N-terminal domain must be combined with the zinc finger domain of ZIC2 to effectively repress the Wnt reporter activity. Thus, multiple domains within ZIC2 are required for observed repression. Further work needs to identify the proteins that interact with these domains. When overexpressed in 293T cells, the C-terminal domain of TCF4 was found to interact with ZIC2, whereas the in vitro translated ZIC2 protein failed to interact with the C-terminal domain of TCF4. This suggests that modulation of the ZIC2 interaction by a factor(s) present in the 293T lysate or indirect binding via other proteins is involved in this interaction. Post-translational modifications cannot be excluded by our data and remain to be investigated. However, previous studies have identified that PARP-1 interacts with the C-terminal domain of TCF4 distal to the HMG domain (21Idogawa M. Yamada T. Honda K. Sato S. Imai K. Hirohashi S. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 1919-1936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been shown independently that both PARP-1 and ZIC2 interact with the Ku70·Ku80·DNA-PKcs complex, known to be required for transcriptional regulation (32Ishiguro A. Ideta M. Mikoshiba K. Chen D.J. Aruga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9983-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Idogawa M. Masutani M. Shitashige M. Honda K. Tokino T. Shinomura Y. Imai K. Hirohashi S. Yamada T. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that ZIC2, PARP-1, and TCF4 are present in the same complex regulating transcription. These data strongly suggest that ZIC2 can modulate Wnt signaling by regulation of the transcriptional activity of the β-catenin·TCF4 complex. We also examined in the TOPflash reporter system the interaction of ZIC2 with known coactivators (p300/CBP (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein) and PARP-1 37Belenkaya T.Y. Han C. Standley H.J. Lin X. Houston D.W. Heasman J. Lin X. Development. 2002; 129: 4089-4101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and corepressors (CtBP (38Brannon M. Brown J.D. Bates R. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Development. 1999; 126: 3159-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), HDAC1 (histone deacetylase-1) (39Billin A.N. Thirlwell H. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6882-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and Groucho/TLE (40Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destrée O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar)) of the β-catenin·Tcf complex. ZIC2 was able to strongly inhibit the inductive effect of the coactivators, whereas its effect on the corepressors could not be determined in this system due to the low TOPflash activity (data not shown). Further investigations are needed to determine the regulatory mechanisms behind ZIC2 inhibition of the β-catenin·TCF4 complex. ZIC2 mutations were initially described in HPE, the most common structural anomaly of the developing forebrain in humans. It has been shown that Zic2 is involved in hindbrain development by contributing to the formation of transient segmented structures called rhombomeres, which are fated to become the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata (41Elms P. Siggers P. Napper D. Greenfield A. Arkell R. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Moens C.B. Prince V.E. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Our Zic2 morpholino knockdown experiment in transgenic Xenopus Wnt reporter embryos showed a robust induction of Wnt reporter activity in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary of injected frogs. Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in formation of the brain signaling center located at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (43Buckles G.R. Thorpe C.J. Ramel M.C. Lekven A.C. Mech. Dev. 2004; 121: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This suggests that Zic2 may tune the activity of Wnt signaling in this region. A similar role has been suggested for SIX3, another HPE gene, as a repressor of Wnt1 expression in the anterior neuroectoderm (44Lagutin O.V. Zhu C.C. Kobayashi D. Topczewski J. Shimamura K. Puelles L. Russell H.R. McKinnon P.J. Solnica-Krezel L. Oliver G. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). How ZIC2 is involved in the dynamic regulation of Wnt signaling during brain formation and its precise biologic role remain to be determined. We are grateful to Drs. Mathijs Baens and Marc Tjwa for helpful discussions and Dr. Stephen A. Brown for providing the antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2036092039,"A chemical genetics approach was taken to identify inhibitors of NS1, a major influenza A virus virulence factor that inhibits host gene expression. A high-throughput screen of 200,000 synthetic compounds identified small molecules that reversed NS1-mediated inhibition of host gene expression. A counterscreen for suppression of influenza virus cytotoxicity identified naphthalimides that inhibited replication of influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The mechanism of action occurs through activation of REDD1 expression and concomitant inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) via TSC1-TSC2 complex. The antiviral activity of naphthalimides was abolished in REDD1(-/-) cells. Inhibition of REDD1 expression by viruses resulted in activation of the mTORC1 pathway. REDD1(-/-) cells prematurely upregulated viral proteins via mTORC1 activation and were permissive to virus replication. In contrast, cells conditionally expressing high concentrations of REDD1 downregulated the amount of viral protein. Thus, REDD1 is a new host defense factor, and chemical activation of REDD1 expression represents a potent antiviral intervention strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2083912864,"Transition between epithelial and mesenchymal states is a feature of both normal development and tumor progression. We report that expression of chloride channel accessory protein hCLCA2 is a characteristic of epithelial differentiation in the immortalized MCF10A and HMLE models, while induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by cell dilution, TGFβ or mesenchymal transcription factors sharply reduces hCLCA2 levels. Attenuation of hCLCA2 expression by lentiviral small hairpin RNA caused cell overgrowth and focus formation, enhanced migration and invasion, and increased mammosphere formation in methylcellulose. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin and fibronectin. Moreover, hCLCA2 expression is greatly downregulated in breast cancer cells with a mesenchymal or claudin-low profile. These observations suggest that loss of hCLCA2 may promote metastasis. We find that higher-than-median expression of hCLCA2 is associated with a one-third lower rate of metastasis over an 18-year period among breast cancer patients compared with lower-than-median (n=344, unfiltered for subtype). Thus, hCLCA2 is required for epithelial differentiation, and its loss during tumor progression contributes to metastasis. Overexpression of hCLCA2 has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation and is accompanied by increases in chloride current at the plasma membrane and reduced intracellular pH (pHi). We found that knockdown cells have sharply reduced chloride current and higher pHi, both characteristics of tumor cells. These results suggest a mechanism for the effects on differentiation. Loss of hCLCA2 may allow escape from pHi homeostatic mechanisms, permitting the higher intracellular and lower extracellular pH that are characteristic of aggressive tumor cells."

TXNIP is a potent negative regulator of glucose uptake, and hence its regulation by MondoA·Mlx triggers a feedback loop that restricts glucose uptake. This feedback loop is similar to the “hexose transport curb” first described almost 30 years ago. We show here that MondoA responds to the non-glucose hexoses, allose, 3-O-methylglucose, and glucosamine by accumulating in the nucleus and activating TXNIP transcription. The metabolic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate blocks the transcriptional response to allose and 3-O-methylglucose, indicating that their metabolism, or a parallel pathway, is required to stimulate MondoA activity. Our dissection of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway suggests that in addition to sensing glucose 6-phosphate, MondoA can also sense glucosamine 6-phosphate. Analysis of glucose uptake in wild-type, MondoA-null, or TXNIP-null murine embryonic fibroblasts indicates a role for the MondoA-TXNIP regulatory circuit in the hexose transport curb, although other redundant pathways also contribute.

Glucose is a fundamental nutrient required for the growth of all organisms. In higher eukaryotes, cells tightly control glucose uptake and glucose utilization through a variety of mechanisms that are understood with different levels of detail. It is clear that alterations in glucose homeostasis have pleiotropic effects in pathobiology. For example, it has been known for >80 years that tumor cells take up and utilize more glucose than their normal counterparts. Furthermore, a base-line change in glucose homeostasis in liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle is a common feature associated with insulin resistance and diabetes. Knowing exactly how cells sense and adapt to changes in extracellular and/or intracellular glucose concentrations is one key to understanding glucose homeostasis. For example, pancreatic β-cells sense elevated intracellular glucose and rapidly secrete insulin into the bloodstream as a primary response. In this case, glucose sensing and response occur exclusively in the cytoplasmic compartment. By contrast, a family of transcriptional regulators has been characterized more recently that play an important role in glucose homeostasis by sensing glucose metabolism and triggering an adaptive transcriptional response (1Kaadige M.R. Elgort M.G. Ayer D.E. Transcription. 2010; 1: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There are two members in this family of transcriptional regulators, MondoA and the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), 3The abbreviations used are: ChREBPcarbohydrate response element-binding protein3-BrPA3-bromopyruvateChoREcarbohydrate response element2DG2-deoxy-d-glucose6DGdeoxy-d-glucoseDNP2,4-dinitrophenolDON6-diazo-5-oxonorleucineMEFmurine embryonic fibroblast3MG3-O-methylglucoseOXPHOSoxidative phosphorylationPGIphosphoglucose isomeraseTXNIPthioredoxin-interacting protein. also known as WBSCR14 or MondoB. MondoA and ChREBP are members of the basic region helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHZip) family of transcription factors. Both MondoA and ChREBP interact with another bHLHZip protein, Mlx. Following elevations in intracellular glucose-derived metabolites, MondoA·Mlx or ChREBP·Mlx complexes bind target promoters and primarily activate their transcription. MondoA and ChREBP are most highly expressed in skeletal muscle and liver, respectively, which is consistent with their function as glucose sensors (2Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Eisenman R.N. The Myc/Max/Mad Transcription Factor Network. Springer, Heidelberg2006: 255-278Google Scholar). Further, each is a prominent regulator of glucose-induced transcription (3Ma L. Robinson L.N.

Our laboratory is focused on MondoA. MondoA does not respond to glucose directly; rather it monitors flux through glycolysis by sensing glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W.

In the absence of glucose, MondoA shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, with the equilibrium strongly favoring a cytoplasmic localization (7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2887-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the presence of increasing glucose levels, MondoA accumulates in the nucleus and occupies the promoters of its targets (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N.

TXNIP has several functions (8Kim S.Y. Suh H.W. Chung J.W. Yoon S.R. Choi I. Cell. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 4: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar, 9Muoio D.M.

Collectively, these data suggest a model where MondoA senses elevations in Glc-6-P and activates TXNIP transcription, thereby initiating a negative feedback mechanism that restricts further glucose uptake (1Kaadige M.R.

This proposed negative feedback loop is conceptually similar to the hexose transport “curb” described in the literature nearly 30 years ago (13Kalckar H.M. Ullrey D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Ullrey D.B. Kalckar H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The key features of this blockade of hexose uptake are that it can be triggered by a number of different sugars, e.g. glucose, allose, and glucosamine, and that it requires protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Given these similarities, we examined whether MondoA could regulate TXNIP expression in response to different sugars and whether the MondoA-TXNIP regulatory circuit contributes to the previously described hexose transport curb. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM containing penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% FBS (HyClone) unless otherwise indicated. HA1ER cells (gift of William Hahn, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) are human embryonic kidney epithelial cells expressing hTERT, the early region from simian virus 40 and H-RasG12V (17Hahn W.C.

MondoA-deficient murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were created by harvesting cells from a MondoAloxP/loxP embryo at day 14 of gestation and transducing the cells in vitro with retroviral pBabePuro-Cre to delete both alleles of MondoA. MondoAloxP/loxP and MondoA−/− MEFs were passaged on a 3T3 protocol to create the immortalized cell lines used here. Additionally, immortalized MondoA−/− cells were transduced with pWZL retroviral vector encoding full-length human MondoA. Plasmids expressing MondoA-V5 and Mlx-FLAG have been described (19Billin A.N.

Wild-type and carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) point mutant TXNIP luciferase reporter constructs have also been described (12Kaadige M.R. Looper R.E. Kamalanaadhan S. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14878-14883Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated overnight in glucose-free DMEM containing 2% serum, followed by a 3-h treatment in the same medium supplemented with a 20 mm concentration, unless otherwise specified, of one of the following hexoses: glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG), 6-deoxy-d-glucose (6DG), 3-O-methylglucose (3MG), or allose. Glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine were used at 5 mm or 10 mm as indicated in the figure legends. Cells at subconfluent densities in 35-mm plates were washed with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer and then incubated for 10 min in KRH containing 1 mm 2DG and 1 mCi of 2-[3H(G)]DG (specific activity 5–10 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were washed with ice-cold KRH to terminate glucose uptake and were then solubilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 + 0.5 m NaOH in H2O, and an aliquot of the lysate assessed by scintillation counting for radiolabel incorporation. Assay results were normalized by determining radiolabel incorporation in control cells pretreated with cytochalasin B (10 mm; Sigma) as well as protein content for each sample. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-MondoA 1:500 (20Sans C.L. Satterwhite D.J. Stoltzman C.A. Breen K.T. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); anti-VDUP1 (TXNIP) 1:1,000 (Medical and Biological Laboratories); anti-tubulin 1:10,000 (Sigma). Secondary antibodies were used at 1:5,000 (Amersham Biosciences). Western Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for detection. Cells were fixed on glass coverslips using PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then labeled by standard indirect immunofluorescence procedures. Mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen) was used at 1:1,000, Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was used at 1:500, and Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) was used at 2 mg/ml to label nuclei. Subcellular immunolocalization of MondoA-V5 protein within individual cells was scored as described previously (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Data are presented as the average ± S.D. resulting from cell counts in five random fields per sample, performed in triplicate. Nonspecific or MondoA-specific shRNA were introduced into the HA1ER cells as described previously (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The glycolysis inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate (3BrPA) (Aldrich), was used concurrently with hexose treatment in glucose-free DMEM. Cells were incubated overnight in glucose-free medium and then treated with glucose, 3MG or allose. Cells were washed once with PBS and scraped into 100 μl of PBS and snap frozen. Metabolites were extracted from cell extracts as described (21Ai J. Trygg J. Gullberg J. Johansson A.I. Jonsson P. Antti H. Marklund S.L. Moritz T. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 8086-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Dried and protein-free pellets were suspended in 40 μl of O-methyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) in pyridine (40 mg/ml), sonicated for 5 min to fully dissolve the dried sample followed by 1 h of incubation at 34 °C. After incubation the solid debris was removed by centrifugation for 3 min at 10,000 × g. Samples were loaded onto a MPS 2 autosampler (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD) where a second derivatization step was programmed. To each sample was added 10 μl of N-methy-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (Pierce) followed by a 30-min incubation with shaking at 37 °C. After incubation, 1 μl was injected to an Agilent split/splitless injector at a 20:1 split ratio. Injector temperature was 250 °C. An Agilent 6890 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) gas chromatograph was employed with the initial temperature held at 95 °C for 2 min followed by a 40 °C/min ramp to 110 °C. A second 5 °C/min ramp was employed to a temperature of 250 °C followed by a final 25 °C/min ramp to 350 °C. This final temperature was held for 3 min. A Restek (Bellefonte, PA) 30-m RTX-5MS column fitted with a 5-m guard column was employed for metabolite separation. A Waters (Beverly, MA) GCT Premier TOF mass spectrometer was used for metabolite detection. For the experiments examining the hexose curb in the different MEF populations, two-way ANOVA models with interaction were fit to log-transformed data. Two-sided Wald p values for the interaction term are reported. MondoA·Mlx complexes accumulate in the nucleus and activate TXNIP expression directly in cells treated with either glucose or its nonmetabolizable analog, 2DG (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 20Sans C.L. Satterwhite D.J. Stoltzman C.A. Breen K.T. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previous experiments suggested that nuclear accumulation of MondoA requires the enzymatic activity of hexokinase (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings in different cell types (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), TXNIP was induced in the HA1ER kidney epithelial cells that were starved for glucose overnight and then treated with either glucose or 2DG for 3 h (Fig. 1A). The nonphosphorylatable glucose analog 6DG did not trigger the nuclear accumulation of MondoA·Mlx complexes and failed to induce TXNIP protein expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, the regulation of TXNIP in HA1ER cells is identical to that observed in other cell lines representing a variety of cell lineages. Thus, the regulation of MondoA by glucose and 2DG is likely a ubiquitous adaptation to changing glucose concentration. 3MG and the rare sugar epimer of glucose, d-allose, up-regulate TXNIP in insulinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, respectively (22Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 23Yamaguchi F. Takata M. Kamitori K. Nonaka M. Dong Y. Sui L. Tokuda M. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar), but MondoA has not been implicated in this regulation. Consistent with these previous reports, TXNIP protein was elevated in both 3MG- and allose-treated control HA1ER cells (Fig. 1A). However, none of the hexoses tested induced TXNIP in cells with reduced MondoA. Thus, TXNIP can be induced by multiple hexoses and in every case its induction was strongly dependent on MondoA. In response to glucose or 2DG, MondoA·Mlx complexes accumulate in the nucleus and occupy the ChoRE of the TXNIP promoter (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2887-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This ChoRE consists of a pair of CACGAG E-box sequences separated by 5 bp and is essential for glucose- or 2DG-dependent activation of TXNIP transcription (22Minn A.H. Hafele C. Shalev A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2397-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Consistent with their induction of TXNIP, 3MG and allose, but not 6DG, drove significant nuclear accumulation of epitope-tagged MondoA in HA1ER cells (Fig. 1B). As with glucose, 3MG and allose strongly increased transcriptional activity of the TXNIP luciferase reporter, and all transcriptional activity was eliminated by mutation of the first E-box sequence of the ChoRE (Fig. 1C). Consistent with MondoA regulating TXNIP directly, glucose, 2DG (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2887-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and allose (data not shown) induced MondoA binding to a region in the TXNIP promoter that contains the ChoREs. MondoA nuclear accumulation requires the phosphorylation of glucose or 2DG by hexokinases, which is the first enzymatic step in the glycolytic pathway (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To investigate further the role of hexose metabolism in MondoA transcriptional activity, we used the glycolytic inhibitor 3-BrPA. Treatment with 3-BrPA significantly reduced the nuclear accumulation of MondoA in cells treated with the different hexoses (Fig. 2A). 3-BrPA also inhibited transcriptional activity from the TXNIP promoter following treatment with each hexose (Fig. 2B). Finally, the hexose-dependent transcriptional activity of the TXNIP luciferase reporter was reduced in MondoA knockdown cells (Fig. 2B), confirming its role in the hexose-dependent activation of TXNIP. Together, these data demonstrate that the hexose-dependent activation of TXNIP requires MondoA, an activity blocked by 3-BrPA, and an intact ChoRE in the TXNIP promoter. Glucose and 2DG are well known substrates for hexokinases; however, the previous results suggest that allose and 3MG are also metabolized to trigger MondoA nuclear accumulation and its activation of TXNIP. Allose phosphate is easily detectable in cell lysates (24Ullrey D.B. Kalckar H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 1504-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas 3MG is generally assumed to be nonmetabolizable. However, several papers provide direct evidence that 3MG can be phosphorylated (25Gatley S.J. Holden J.E. Halama J.R. DeGrado T.R. Bernstein D.R. Ng C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Cortès S. Gromova M. Evrard A. Roby C. Heyraud A. Rolin D.B. Raymond P. Brouquisse R.M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To address this point, we determined the level of each hexose and the corresponding phosphorylated counterpart in MEFs by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2C). Consistent with their rapid flux through glycolysis, glucose and glucose phosphate accumulated to low levels, By contrast, 2DG phosphate, which is not further metabolized by glycolysis, accumulated to high levels. Allose phosphate and 3MG phosphate were also easily detectable in this assay, indicating that they are also substrates for hexokinases. The levels of glucose phosphate and 3MG phosphate were comparable, suggesting 3MG phosphate accumulated to a sufficient level to drive MondoA activation of TXNIP. 2DG drives MondoA nuclear accumulation and activity at the TXNIP promoter more effectively than does glucose (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this differential effect reflects an accumulation of 2DG 6-phosphate, whereas Glc-6-P is rapidly shunted into other metabolic pathways (Fig. 2C) (1Kaadige M.R. Elgort M.G. Ayer D.E. Transcription. 2010; 1: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We used a mutant cell line highly defective in phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI−) and its wild-type counterpart to investigate more thoroughly the role of hexose phosphates in regulating MondoA activity (18Pouysségur J. Franchi A. Salomon J.C. Silvestre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980; 77: 2698-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Pouysségur J. Franchi A. Silvestre P. Nature. 1980; 287: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). PGI converts Glc-6-P to fructose 6-phosphate; thus, the PGI-null cells accumulate higher levels of Glc-6-P than the wild-type controls. The wild-type parental cell line, CCL39, displayed marked nuclear MondoA accumulation following treatment with 2DG and allose, but not with low or high glucose or 3MG. This finding is consistent with the higher accumulation of 2DG phosphate and allose phosphate in MEFs (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the PGI− DS7 cells displayed strong nuclear accumulation of MondoA in the presence of all of the hexoses (Fig. 3A). Thus, loss of PGI allows glucose and 3MG to drive nuclear accumulation of MondoA to a similar level as that observed with 2DG and allose, a finding consistent with MondoA sensing a phosphorylated hexose. Each hexose induced TXNIP expression in the parental CCL39 cells (Fig. 3B), similar to the induction observed in the HA1ER cells (Fig. 1A). The low level of TXNIP in 2DG-treated cells likely results from reduced translational efficiency because 2DG inhibits mTOR kinase, as evidenced by a reduction in phosphorylated S6 in HA1ER cells (Fig. 1A) and as reported in the literature (28Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Bardeesy N. DePinho R.A. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The PGI− DS7 cells showed a similar pattern of TXNIP induction with the different hexoses, although TXNIP levels were generally lower in the mutant cell line. This result is not surprising because the nuclear levels of MondoA and its activity at the TXNIP promoter can be uncoupled (7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2887-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In both cell lines, each sugar induced a hexose transport curb and reduced glucose uptake by about 50% (Fig. 3C). Thus, TXNIP induction generally correlated with the hexose transport curb. Paradoxically, glucose uptake in the PGI− DS7 cells was lower under each condition compared with those observed in the CCL39 cells (Fig. 3C). Together, these data suggest a role for TXNIP in the hexose transport curb, but other TXNIP-independent mechanisms altered in the PGI mutant cells must govern basal glucose uptake. The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is implicated in blocking glucose uptake and inducing insulin resistance (29McClain D.A. J. Diabetes Complications. 2002; 16: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Further, glucosamine, which enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, is sufficient to trigger a hexose transport curb (15Ullrey D.B. Kalckar H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 3678-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we thought that glucosamine might also regulate MondoA transcriptional activity. Glucosamine 6-phosphate is generated through the donation of the amine from glutamine to fructose 6-phosphate in the first step of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Consistent with our previous reports in other cell lines (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14878-14883Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Elgort M.G. O'Shea J.M. Jiang Y. Ayer D.E. Genes Cancer. 2010; 1: 893-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we found that glucose stimulated TXNIP expression in the 143B osteosarcoma cell line and that glutamine repressed the glucose-dependent activation (Fig. 4A). Glucosamine stimulated TXNIP expression in the complete absence of glucose. Glucosamine also stimulated TXNIP expression in BxPC3 cells, indicating that its effect is not restricted to 143B cells (data not shown) Two mechanisms may account for the glucosamine-dependent activation of TXNIP: (i) MondoA may sense glucosamine 6-phosphate directly, or (ii) glucosamine 6-phosphate may be processed by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and MondoA may sense a downstream metabolite. N-Acetylglucosamine, which enters the hexosamine pathway just below glucosamine 6-phosphate did not drive TXNIP expression (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that MondoA does not sense hexosamine biosynthetic pathway intermediates downstream of glucosamine 6-phosphate, but may sense glucosamine 6-phosphate directly. To test whether MondoA can sense glucose flux into glucosamine 6-phosphate we blocked the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate via glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase using the glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine (DON). DON potently inhibited the glucose-dependent induction of TXNIP (Fig. 4B), suggesting that intermediates downstream of fructose 6-phosphate and glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase contribute to TXNIP induction. Glucosamine completely rescued the DON blockade, whereas N-acetylglucosamine had a minimal effect. Thus, these data suggest that glucosamine 6-phosphate, but not other downstream components of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, regulate TXNIP expression. Furthermore, we conclude that flux into the hexosamine pathway and not just flux through glycolysis can stimulate TXNIP expression. To determine the roles of MondoA and TXNIP in the hexose transport curb, we investigated the curb in wild-type, MondoA knock-out or TXNIP knock-out MEFs (7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2887-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We also investigated the role of TXNIP as a MondoA effector by expressing a TXNIP-mCherry chimera in MondoA knock-out cells. TXNIP protein was strongly induced by allose in wild-type MEFs, but was completely absent in MondoA knock-out cells under all growth conditions (Fig. 5A). TXNIP-mCherry expression in MondoA knock-out cells was unresponsive to changes in hexose status. Identical to our previous results (7Peterson C.W. Stoltzman C.A. Sighinolfi M.P. Han K.S. Ayer D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 2887-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), MondoA knock-out MEFs had elevated glucose uptake compared with wild-type controls in normal growth medium and following an overnight period in glucose-free medium (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Addition of allose to wild-type MEF cells reduced glucose uptake 2.2-fold. In contrast, allose reduced glucose uptake just 1.6-fold in MondoA knock-out MEFs. Thus, MondoA contributes to the hexose transport curb. Introduction of TXNIP-mCherry into MondoA knock-out MEFs reduced glucose uptake to levels below those observed in wild-type cells in control and glucose-starved cells (Fig. 5B and data not shown). Addition of allose to the complemented cells resulted in an intermediate reduction of 1.9-fold in glucose uptake compared with wild-type or MondoA knock-out MEFs (Fig. 5B). Thus, TXNIP is sufficient to function as a MondoA effector in the hexose transport curb. As a final test of the contribution of the MondoA-TXNIP circuit to the hexose transport curb, we determined glucose uptake in wild-type and TXNIP-null MEFs. As expected, genetic deletion of TXNIP resulted in increased glucose uptake (Fig. 5C). Similar to the effect of MondoA deletion, TXNIP deletion reduced the magnitude of the allose-induced hexose curb. In this experiment, allose reduced glucose uptake 2.8-fold of control levels in wild-type MEFs, but only reduced glucose uptake 1.7-fold in TXNIP knock-out cells. Thus, like MondoA, TXNIP contributes to the hexose transport curb. In addition to hexose treatment, the hexose transport curb also depends on oxidative phosphorylation (31Kalckar H.M. Christopher C.W. Ullrey D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 6453-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of the proton gradient uncoupler DNP on TXNIP expression and glucose uptake in MEFs. DNP treatment almost completely prevented the robust allose-dependent up-regulation of TXNIP (Fig. 6A). Consistent with the changes in TXNIP expression, glucose uptake was significantly lower in allose-treated MEFs (Fig. 6B), and treatment with DNP almost completely eliminated the allose-induced glucose uptake curb. To investigate the role of MondoA in mediating the effects of DNP, we examined MondoA-null MEFs and MondoA-null MEFs complemented with wild-type MondoA. As expected, following allose treatment, TXNIP expression was absent in the MondoA-null cells, but completely restored in the rescued MEFs (Fig. 6C). Allose + DNP co-treatment blocked TXNIP expression in the complemented MEFs. Similar to findings shown in Fig. 5B, MondoA-null MEFs responded partially to allose treatment and reduced glucose uptake 1.6-fold (Fig. 6D). Complemented MEFs showed a more dramatic 4-fold allose-triggered reduction in glucose uptake. DNP did not reverse the hexose transport curb in MondoA-null MEFs, but the DNP effect was restored in the complemented cells (Fig. 6D). Thus, MondoA is required for DNP to block the hexose transport curb. Cells sense and respond to glucose in an effort to maintain the delicate balance of glucose homeostasis. The MondoA and ChREBP transcription factors are predominant glucose sensors in mammalian cells (1Kaadige M.R. Elgort M.G. Ayer D.E. Transcription. 2010; 1: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Postic C. Dentin R. Denechaud P.D. Girard J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Uyeda K. Repa J.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 107-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Here, we show that MondoA also responds to other hexoses and is required for full elaboration of the previously described hexose transport curb. TXNIP contributes as a MondoA effector of the hexose transport curb, but other factors also play a role. Finally, we show that uncoupling of the electron transport chain abrogates TXNIP expression, reduces the hexose transport curb, and increases glucose uptake. These data are consistent with MondoA transcriptional activation at the TXNIP promoter being controlled by flux through glycolysis and mitochondrial activity. Thus, MondoA can interpret and integrate intracellular bioenergetic cues. Previous studies showed that 3MG and allose induce TXNIP expression (23Yamaguchi F. Takata M. Kamitori K. Nonaka M. Dong Y. Sui L. Tokuda M. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 377-385PubMed Google Scholar, 32Minn A.H. Couto F.M. Shalev A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11047-11051Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These two sugars drive MondoA nuclear accumulation and activate TXNIP transcription in a manner that is entirely dependent on the ChoRE in the TXNIP promoter. Induction of TXNIP by 3MG and allose is severely impaired in MondoA knockdown cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, allose fails to induce TXNIP in cells with a genetic deletion of MondoA (Figs. 5A and 6C), yet this induction is restored when the knock-out cells are complemented with wild-type MondoA. Collectively, these data suggest that the induction of TXNIP by 3MG and allose results from their stimulation of MondoA transcriptional activity at the TXNIP promoter. Interestingly, the glucose epimers psicose, altrose, mannose, and galactose do not induce TXNIP (data not shown), demonstrating that not all hexoses are capable of regulating MondoA function. We originally proposed that MondoA senses Glc-6-P (4Stoltzman C.A. Peterson C.W. Breen K.T. Muoio D.M. Billin A.N. Ayer D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6912-6917Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and our experiments here using the PGI-defective cells provides further evidence to support that conclusion (Fig. 3). Glucosamine can also activate TXNIP expression. Glucosamine feeds the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which is implicated in insulin resistance and diabetes (29McClain D.A. J. Diabetes Complications. 2002; 16: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, glucosamine may contribute to insulin resistance by up-regulating TXNIP. The glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase inhibitor, DON, reduces the glucose-dependent induction of TXNIP, and this blockade can be overcome with glucosamine, but not N-acetylglucosamine (Fig. 4). The lack of rescue by N-acetylglucosamine suggests that MondoA is not regulated by flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and makes it unlikely that MondoA itself is sugar-modified in a way that controls its transcriptional activity. Interestingly, a recent paper demonstrates that ChREBP is β-N-acetylglucosamine-modified which increases its transcriptional activity (33Guinez C. Filhoulaud G. Rayah-Benhamed F. Marmier S. Dubuquoy C. Dentin R. Moldes M. Burnol A.F. Yang X. Lefebvre T. Girard J. Postic C. Diabetes. 2011; 60: 1399-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Apparently, MondoA and ChREBP are functionally divergent in this regard. Glucosamine induced nuclear accumulation of MondoA (data not shown), suggesting that it functions similarly to glucose. This is not surprising as Glc-6-P and glucosamine 6-phosphate only differ at the 2 position. We propose that the glucose-induced transcriptional activation of TXNIP reflects the combined effects of Glc-6-P, its flux into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, and production of glucosamine 6-phosphate. TXNIP is also activated by allose and 3MG, and this activation requires MondoA. Allose phosphate has been detected in mammalian cells, but the kinase responsible has not been identified (24Ullrey D.B. Kalckar H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 1504-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By contrast, 3MG is generally considered to be nonmetabolizable; however, several publications challenge this convention (25Gatley S.J. Holden J.E. Halama J.R. DeGrado T.R. Bernstein D.R. Ng C.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 119: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Cortès S. Gromova M. Evrard A. Roby C. Heyraud A. Rolin D.B. Raymond P. Brouquisse R.M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We detected allose phosphate and 3MG phosphate using mass spectrometry approaches, and their activation of TXNIP is blocked by the metabolic inhibitor 3-BrPA. The level of 3MG phosphate is low likely because it is a poor substrate for hexokinases. However, it does accumulate to levels similar to Glc-6-P, suggesting that even at low levels 3MG phosphate is sufficient to drive the nuclear accumulation of MondoA·Mlx complexes. 3MG phosphate accumulates to a level below that of 2DG phosphate, yet both hexoses induce TXNIP to a similar level. This finding suggests that MondoA·Mlx transcriptional activity is limited by mechanisms other than the absolute level of hexose phosphate. Thus our data are consistent with MondoA nuclear activity being regulated by the phosphorylated forms of allose and 3MG. The hexose transport curb is not a passive response of cells to accumulated Glc-6-P, but rather requires initial feeding with a hexose, an intact oxidative phosphorylation pathway, and protein synthesis (13Kalckar H.M. Ullrey D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 14Ullrey D.B. Kalckar H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 5858-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 27Pouysségur J. Franchi A. Silvestre P. Nature. 1980; 287: 445-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31Kalckar H.M.

U.S.A. 1982; 79: 3777-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the MondoA-TXNIP negative feedback circuit is a required component of the hexose transport curb. Multiple experiments support this contention. First, the hexose transport curb is reduced in MondoA- or TXNIP-null MEFs (Fig. 5, B and C), directly implicating both proteins in the curb. Second, the hexose transport curb is restored in MondoA-null MEFs complemented with wild-type MondoA (Fig. 6D), indicating that the defect in the curb in MondoA knock-out cells can be attributed to MondoA. Third, the hexose transport curb is also restored in MondoA-null MEFs by complementation with TXNIP, indicating an important role for TXNIP as a MondoA effector. Finally, both the hexose transport curb and TXNIP protein synthesis are extinguished by DNP (Fig. 6, A and B), demonstrating a strict requirement for mitochondrial function in regulating TXNIP protein levels and maintaining the curb. Thus, we propose that the hexose-and MondoA-dependent regulation of TXNIP is required for the full elaboration of the hexose transport curb. The curb is only partially reduced in MEFs lacking MondoA or TXNIP, indicating contributions by other factors. The nuclear function of ChREBP is also glucose-regulated (5Postic C. Dentin R. Denechaud P.D. Girard J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2007; 27: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Uyeda K. Repa J.J. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 107-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), thus it is possible that ChREBP functions redundantly with MondoA in the hexose transport curb. Similarly, the TXNIP paralog, ARRDC4, is also up-regulated by glucose and allose in a MondoA-dependent manner (data not shown). Like TXNIP, ARRDC4 is a potent negative regulator of glucose uptake (11Patwari P. Chutkow W.A. Cummings K. Verstraeten V.L. Lammerding J. Schreiter E.R. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24996-25003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that TXNIP and ARRDC4 function together downstream of MondoA, and possibly ChREBP, to drive the majority of the hexose transport curb. Our work here provides the foundation to address this important question. DNP effectively blocked the allose-dependent and MondoA-dependent induction of TXNIP, suggesting that MondoA requires a signal generated by OXPHOS to activate TXNIP transcription. Furthermore, consistent with previous reports (34Ullrey D.B. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Kalckar H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1982; 79: 3777-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), DNP reversed the hexose transport curb (Fig. 6B). We are currently working to identify this signal. Given that MondoA senses phosphorylated hexoses, it is possible that OXPHOS-derived ATP is required for MondoA nuclear activity. Although precise mechanism(s) by which OXPHOS controls MondoA activity and TXNIP expression remains to be determined, our studies highlight cross-talk between mitochondrial activity and glycolytic flux in regulating MondoA and the hexose transport curb. We thank the Ayer laboratory for reviewing the manuscript and W. Chutkow for the TXNIP+/+ and TXNIP−/− MEFs."
https://openalex.org/W2047937385,"SQN (SQUINT) is the Arabidopsis ortholog of the immunophilin CyP40 (cyclophilin 40) and promotes microRNA activity by promoting the activity of AGO1. In animals and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CyP40 promotes protein activity in association with the protein chaperone Hsp90. To determine whether CyP40 also acts in association with Hsp90 in plants, we examined the interaction between SQN and Hsp90 in vitro and tested the importance of this interaction for the function of SQN in planta. We found that SQN interacts with cytoplasmic Hsp90 proteins but not with Hsp90 proteins localized to chloroplasts, mitochondria, or the endoplasmic reticulum. The interaction between SQN and Hsp90 in vitro requires the MEEVD domain of Hsp90, as well as several conserved amino acids within the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of SQN. Amino acid substitutions that disrupt the interaction between SQN and Hsp90 in vitro also impair the activity of SQN in planta. Our results indicate that the interaction between CyP40 and Hsp90 is conserved in plants and that this interaction is essential for the function of CyP40."
https://openalex.org/W1982147571,"The anti-VEGF targeted antibody bevacizumab (BVZ) has been approved for treating renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Although BVZ increases the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic RCC, the effect on overall survival is poor. To gain insight into the limited efficacy of BVZ on overall survival, we analyzed patient samples of RCC for angiogenic factors that may participate in escape from anti-VEGF therapy. Our study shows that the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumors was increased compared with normal tissue. The level of interleukin-8/CXCL8, a pro-angiogenic member of the CXCL family of cytokines, was also increased in tumors. These observations gave us a good reason to analyze the combined effects of BVZ and anti-CXCL8 antibodies on tumor growth. Surprisingly, we report that BVZ accelerates the growth of RCC in nude mice with in vivo selection of tumor cells with an increased growth capacity. Downregulation of receptor tyrosine phosphatase-κ, a phosphatase implicated in EGF receptor regulation, may partly explain this phenomenon. Modification of the vascular network and development of lymphatic vessels through VEGF-C production and compensatory production of pro-angiogenic CXCL cytokines were also observed. The apparent normalization of the vascular network prompted us to associate BVZ with the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. While efficient in vitro, paclitaxel did not reverse the anti-VEGF effects in vivo. Anti-CXCL8-targeting antibodies were promising as they decreased intra-tumor VEGF production; decreased the pro-angiogenic CXCL/anti-angiogenic CXCL ratio and did not induce lymphangiogenesis. These observations hold clinical implication as they highlight putative markers implicated in escape from BVZ treatment. They also recommend proceeding with caution in the use of anti-VEGF therapy alone for treatment of RCC."
https://openalex.org/W2111528037,"Cell migration plays a crucial role in numerous cellular functions, and alterations in the regulation of cell migration are required for invasive transformation of a tumor cell. While the mechanistic process of actin-based migration has been well documented, little is known as to the specific function of the nonmuscle actin isoforms in mammalian cells. Here, we present a comprehensive examination of γ-actin's role in cell migration using an RNAi approach. The partial suppression of γ-actin expression in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells resulted in a significant decrease in wound healing and transwell migration. Similarly, the knockdown of γ-actin significantly reduced speed of motility and severely affected the cell's ability to explore, which was, in part, due to a loss of cell polarity. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the size and number of paxillin-containing focal adhesions, coupled with a significant decrease in phosphorylated paxillin in γ-actin-knockdown cells. In addition, there was a significant increase in the phosphorylation of cofilin and myosin regulatory light chain, suggesting an overactivated Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway in γ-actin-knockdown cells. The alterations in the phosphorylation of paxillin and myosin regulatory light chain were unique to γ-actin and not β-actin knockdown. Inhibition of the ROCK pathway with the inhibitor Y-27632 restored the ability of γ-actin-knockdown cells to migrate. This study demonstrates γ-actin as a potential upstream regulator of ROCK mediated cell migration."

We aimed to identify novel targets of DNMT3B and their potential regulatory mechanisms in HCC. Metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) was one of the DNMT3B targets and selected for further study. DNMT3B overexpression was detected in 81.25% of clinical HCC specimens and was negatively associated with MTSS1 in HCC cells and clinical samples. The underlying mechanism by which DNMT3B silences MTSS1 was studied using a combination of methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bisulfite genome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR and luciferase reporter assays. We found that the MTSS1 promoter region was sparsely methylated, and the methylation inhibitors failed to abolish DNMT3B-mediated MTSS1 silencing. DNMT3B protein bound directly to the 5′-flanking region (−865/−645) of the MTSS1 gene to inhibit its transcription. The functional role of MTSS1 was investigated using in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity assays. As a result, MTSS1 exerted tumor suppressor effects and arrested cells in the G2/M phase, but not the G1/S phase of the cell cycle when it was depleted or overexpressed in HCC cells. Taken together, MTSS1, a novel target of DNMT3B, is repressed by DNMT3B via a DNA methylation-independent mechanism. MTSS1 was further characterized as a novel tumor suppressor gene in HCC. These findings highlight how DNMT3B regulates MTSS1, and such data may be useful for the development of new treatment options for HCC."

https://openalex.org/W2011018737,"Manganese superoxide dismutase is a nuclear encoded primary antioxidant enzyme localized exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix. Genotoxic agents, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, generates oxidative stress and cause mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage. The mtDNA polymerase (Polγ), a major constituent of nucleoids, is responsible for the replication and repair of the mitochondrial genome. Recent studies suggest that the mitochondria contain fidelity proteins and MnSOD constitutes an integral part of the nucleoid complex. However, it is not known whether or how MnSOD participates in the mitochondrial repair processes. Using skin tissue from C57BL/6 mice exposed to UVB radiation, we demonstrate that MnSOD has a critical role in preventing mtDNA damage by protecting the function of Polγ. Quantitative–PCR analysis shows an increase in mtDNA damage after UVB exposure. Immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies demonstrate p53 translocation to the mitochondria and interaction with Polγ after UVB exposure. The mtDNA immunoprecipitation assay with Polγ and p53 antibodies in p53+/+ and p53−/− mice demonstrates an interaction between MnSOD, p53 and Polγ. The results suggest that these proteins form a complex for the repair of UVB-associated mtDNA damage. The data also demonstrate that UVB exposure injures the mtDNA D-loop in a p53-dependent manner. Using MnSOD-deficient mice we demonstrate that UVB-induced mtDNA damage is MnSOD dependent. Exposure to UVB results in nitration and inactivation of Polγ, which is prevented by addition of the MnSOD mimetic MnIIITE-2-PyP5+. These results demonstrate for the first time that MnSOD is a fidelity protein that maintains the activity of Polγ by preventing UVB-induced nitration and inactivation of Polγ. The data also demonstrate that MnSOD has a role along with p53 to prevent mtDNA damage."

Despite many efforts, all attempts so far have failed to culture the disease-relevant multiplying amastigote stage of L. major. Here, we established a stably growing axenic L. major amastigote culture system that was characterized genetically, morphologically, and by stage-specific DsRed protein expression. We found parasite stage-specific disease development in resistant C57BL/6 mice. Human neutrophils, as first host cells for promastigotes, do not take up amastigotes. In human macrophages, we observed an amastigote-specific complement receptor 3-mediated, endocytotic entry mechanism, whereas promastigotes are taken up by complement receptor 1-mediated phagocytosis. Promastigote infection of macrophages induced the inflammatory mediators TNF, CCL3, and CCL4, whereas amastigote infection was silent and resulted in significantly increased parasite numbers: from 7.1 ± 1.4 (after 3 h) to 20.1 ± 7.9 parasites/cell (after 96 h). Our study identifies Leishmania stage-specific disease development, host cell preference, entry mechanism, and immune evasion. Since the amastigote stage is the disease-propagating form found in the infected mammalian host, the newly developed L. major axenic cultures will serve as an important tool in better understanding the amastigote-driven immune response in leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W1993550047,"B cell lymphoma survival requires tonic or ligand-independent signals through activation of Syk by the B cell receptor. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein latent membrane 2a (LMP2a), a mimic of the B cell receptor, provides constitutive survival signals for latently infected cells through Syk activation; however, the precise downstream mechanisms coordinating this survival response in EBV+ B cell lymphomas remain to be elucidated. Herein, we assess the mechanism of Syk survival signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphomas from post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) to discover virally controlled therapeutic targets involved in lymphomagenesis and tumor progression. Using small molecule inhibition and siRNA strategies, we show that Syk inhibition reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of PTLD-derived EBV+ B cell lines. Syk inhibition also reduces autocrine IL-10 production. Although Syk inhibition attenuates signaling through both the PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways, only PI3K/Akt inhibition causes apoptosis of PTLD-derived cell lines. Loss of the endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP is observed after Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition. The loss of XIAP and apoptosis that results from Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition is reversed by inhibition of the mitochondrial protease HtrA2. Thus, Syk drives EBV+ B cell lymphoma survival through PI3K/Akt activation, which prevents the HtrA2-dependent loss of XIAP. Syk, Akt, and XIAP antagonists may present potential new therapeutic strategies for PTLD through targeting of EBV-driven survival signals. B cell lymphoma survival requires tonic or ligand-independent signals through activation of Syk by the B cell receptor. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein latent membrane 2a (LMP2a), a mimic of the B cell receptor, provides constitutive survival signals for latently infected cells through Syk activation; however, the precise downstream mechanisms coordinating this survival response in EBV+ B cell lymphomas remain to be elucidated. Herein, we assess the mechanism of Syk survival signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphomas from post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) to discover virally controlled therapeutic targets involved in lymphomagenesis and tumor progression. Using small molecule inhibition and siRNA strategies, we show that Syk inhibition reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of PTLD-derived EBV+ B cell lines. Syk inhibition also reduces autocrine IL-10 production. Although Syk inhibition attenuates signaling through both the PI3K/Akt and Erk pathways, only PI3K/Akt inhibition causes apoptosis of PTLD-derived cell lines. Loss of the endogenous caspase inhibitor XIAP is observed after Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition. The loss of XIAP and apoptosis that results from Syk or PI3K/Akt inhibition is reversed by inhibition of the mitochondrial protease HtrA2. Thus, Syk drives EBV+ B cell lymphoma survival through PI3K/Akt activation, which prevents the HtrA2-dependent loss of XIAP. Syk, Akt, and XIAP antagonists may present potential new therapeutic strategies for PTLD through targeting of EBV-driven survival signals. Syk activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt prevents HtrA2-dependent loss of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) to promote survival of Epstein-Barr virus+ (EBV+) B cell lymphomas.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 287Issue 17PreviewVOLUME 286 (2011) PAGES 37368–37378 Full-Text PDF Open Access"
https://openalex.org/W1972933892,"Obesity is associated with hepatic steatosis, partially due to increased lipogenesis and decreased fatty acid β-oxidation in the liver; however, the underlying mechanism of abnormal lipid metabolism is not fully understood. We reported previously that obesity is associated with LCN13 (lipocalin 13) deficiency. LCN13 is a lipocalin family member involved in glucose metabolism, and LCN13 deficiency appears to contribute to hyperglycemia in obese mice. Here, we show that LCN13 is also an important regulator of lipogenesis and β-oxidation in the liver. In primary hepatocytes, recombinant LCN13 directly suppressed lipogenesis and increased fatty acid β-oxidation, whereas neutralization of endogenous LCN13 had an opposite effect. Transgenic overexpression of LCN13 protected against hepatic steatosis in mice with either dietary or genetic (ob/ob) obesity. LCN13 transgenic overexpression also improved hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in ob/ob mice. Short-term LCN13 overexpression via an adenovirus-mediated gene transfer similarly attenuated hepatic steatosis in db/db mice. LCN13 inhibited the expression of important lipogenic genes and stimulated the genes that promote β-oxidation. These results suggest that LCN13 decreases liver lipid levels by both inhibiting hepatic lipogenesis and stimulating β-oxidation. LCN13 deficiency is likely to contribute to fatty liver disease in obese mice."
https://openalex.org/W2031032918,"The pro-survival kinase Akt requires phosphorylation at two conserved residues, the activation loop site (Thr-308) and the hydrophobic motif site (Ser-473), for maximal activation. Previous reports indicate that mTORC2 is necessary for phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif and that this site is not phosphorylated in cells lacking components of the mTORC2 complex, such as Sin1. Here we show that Akt can be phosphorylated at the hydrophobic motif site (Ser-473) in the absence of mTORC2. First, increasing the levels of PIP(3) in Sin1(-/-) MEFs by (i) expression of a constitutively active PI3K or (ii) relief of a negative feedback loop on PI3K by prolonged inhibition of mTORC1 or S6K is sufficient to rescue hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Akt. The resulting accumulation of PIP(3) at the plasma membrane results in Ser-473 phosphorylation. Second, constructs of Akt in which the PH domain is constitutively disengaged from the kinase domain are phosphorylated at the hydrophobic motif site in Sin1(-/-) MEFs; both myristoylated-Akt and Akt lacking the PH domain are phosphorylated at Ser-473. Thus, disruption of the interface between the PH and kinase domains of Akt bypasses the requirement for mTORC2. In summary, these data support a model in which Akt can be phosphorylated at Ser-473 and activated in the absence of mTORC2 by mechanisms that depend on removal of the PH domain from the kinase domain."

To identify β-citrylglutamate hydrolase, this enzyme was partially purified from mouse testis and characterized. Interestingly, in the presence of Ca2+, the purified enzyme specifically hydrolyzed β-citrylglutamate and did not act on N-acetyl-aspartylglutamate (NAAG). However, both compounds were hydrolyzed in the presence of Mn2+. This behavior and the fact that the enzyme was glycosylated and membrane-bound suggested that β-citrylglutamate hydrolase belonged to the same family of protein as glutamate carboxypeptidase 2 (GCP2), the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-aspartylglutamate. The mouse tissue distribution of β-citrylglutamate hydrolase was strikingly similar to that of the glutamate carboxypeptidase 3 (GCP3) mRNA, but not that of the GCP2 mRNA.

A comparison of the structures of the catalytic sites of GCP2 and GCP3, as well as mutagenesis experiments revealed that a single amino acid substitution (Asn-519 in GCP2, Ser-509 in GCP3) is largely responsible for GCP3 being able to hydrolyze β-citrylglutamate.

https://openalex.org/W1963508841,"Contemporary evolution following assisted colonization may increase the probability of persistence for refuge populations established as a bet-hedge for protected species. Such refuge populations are considered ""genetic replicates"" that might be used for future re-colonization in the event of a catastrophe in the native site. Although maladaptive evolutionary divergence of captive populations is well recognized, evolutionary divergence of wild refuge populations may also occur on contemporary time scales. Thus, refuge populations may lose their ""value"" as true genetic replicates of the native population. Here, we show contemporary evolutionary divergence in body shape in an approximately 30-year old refuge population of the protected White Sands pupfish (Cyprinodon tularosa) resulting in a body-shape mismatch with its native environment.Geometric morphometic data were collected from C. tularosa cultures raised in experimental mesocosms. Cultures were initiated with fish from the two native populations, plus hybrids, in high or low salinity treatments representing the salinities of the two native habitats. We found that body shape was heritable and that shape variation due to phenotypic plasticity was small compared to shape variation due to population source. C. tularosa from the high salinity population retained slender body shapes and fish from the low salinity population retained deep body shapes, irrespective of mesocosm salinity. These data suggest that the observed divergence of a recently established pupfish population was not explained by plasticity. An analysis of microsatellite variation indicated that no significant genetic drift occurred in the refuge population, further supporting the adaptive nature of changes in body shape. These lines of evidence suggest that body shape divergence of the refuge population reflects a case of contemporary evolution (over a 30-year period).These results suggest assisted colonization can introduce novel, and/or relaxed selection, and lead to unintended evolutionary divergence."

However, unlike DUSP6/MKP-3, DUSP9/MKP-4 also inactivates the p38α MAP kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of both ERK1/2 and p38α by DUSP9/MKP-4 is mediated by a conserved arginine-rich kinase interaction motif located within the amino-terminal non-catalytic domain of the protein. Furthermore, DUSP9/MKP-4 is unique among these cytoplasmic MKPs in containing a conserved PKA consensus phosphorylation site 55RRXSer-58 immediately adjacent to the kinase interaction motif. DUSP9/MKP-4 is phosphorylated on Ser-58 by PKA in vitro, and phosphorylation abrogates the binding of DUSP9/MKP-4 to both ERK2 and p38α MAP kinases. In addition, although mutation of Ser-58 to either alanine or glutamic acid does not affect the intrinsic catalytic activity of DUSP9/MKP-4, phospho-mimetic (Ser-58 to Glu) substitution inhibits both the interaction of DUSP9/MKP-4 with ERK2 and p38α in vivo and its ability to dephosphorylate and inactivate these MAP kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2073368001,"Growth factor signaling coupled to activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. The key regulatory kinase of Akt has been identified as mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), which functions as the PI3K-dependent Ser-473 kinase of Akt. This kinase complex is assembled by mTOR and its essential components rictor, Sin1 and mLST8. The recent genetic screening study in Caenorhabditis elegans has linked a specific point mutation of rictor to an elevated storage of fatty acids that resembles the rictor deficiency phenotype. In our study, we show that in mammalian cells the analogous single rictor point mutation (G934E) prevents the binding of rictor to Sin1 and the assembly of mTORC2, but this mutation does not interfere with the binding of the rictor-interacting protein Protor. A substitution of the rictor Gly-934 residue to a charged amino acid prevents formation of the rictor/Sin1 heterodimer. The cells expressing the rictor G934E mutant remain deficient in the mTORC2 signaling, as detected by the reduced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 and a low cell proliferation rate. Thus, although a full length of rictor is required to interact with its binding partner Sin1, a single amino acid of rictor Gly-934 controls its interaction with Sin1 and assembly of mTORC2."
https://openalex.org/W2015707644,"Thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system in humans. To understand the molecular genetic events underlying thyroid carcinogenesis, we have generated a mouse model that spontaneously develops follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human thyroid cancer (ThrbPV/PV mouse). This mutant mouse harbors a dominant-negative mutated thyroid hormone receptor β (denoted PV). The PV mutation was identified in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (TH). ThrbPV/PV mice exhibit highly elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and increased TH. We have previously shown that thyroid-stimulating hormone is required, but not sufficient to induce metastatic follicular thyroid cancer in ThrbPV/PV mice. However, whether the elevated TH also contributes to the thyroid carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice was not elucidated. To understand the role of TH in thyroid carcinogenesis, we blocked the production of TH by treating ThrbPV/PV mice with propylthiouracil (ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice) and compared the development of thyroid cancer in ThrbPV/PV-PTU and untreated ThrbPV/PV mice. We found that thyroid tumor growth was reduced by ∼42% in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice as compared with ThrbPV/PV mice. Analysis by bromodeoxyuridine-nuclear labeling showed decreased incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in thyroid tumor cells of ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice, indicative of decreased tumor cell proliferation. However, cleaved-caspase 3 staining showed no apparent changes in apoptosis of tumor cells in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. Molecular studies identified a marked attenuation of the PI3K–AKT–β-catenin signaling pathway that led to decreased protein levels of cyclin D2, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation in ThrbPV/PV-PTU mice. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase-2, a downstream target of β-catenin and a key regulator during tumor invasion and metastasis, was also decreased. Thus, the present study uncovers a critical role of TH in promoting the thyroid carcinogenesis of ThrbPV/PV mice via membrane signaling events. Importantly, these findings suggest that anti-thyroid drugs could be considered as possible therapeutic agents of thyroid cancer."

Deregulated Myc expression in cancers can result from MYC gene amplification and translocation but also from alterations in mitogenic signaling pathways that affect Myc levels through both transcriptional and post-transcription mechanisms. For example, mutations in Ras family GTPase proteins that cause their constitutive activation can increase cellular levels of c-Myc by interfering with its rapid proteasomal degradation. Although enhanced protein stability is generally thought to be applicable to other Myc family members, here we show that c-Myc and its paralog N-Myc respond to oncogenic H-Ras (H-RasG12V) in very different ways. H-RasG12V promotes accumulation of both c-Myc and N-Myc, but although c-Myc accumulation is achieved by enhanced protein stability, N-Myc accumulation is associated with an accelerated rate of translation that overcomes a surprising H-RasG12V-mediated destabilization of N-Myc.

This mechanism of c-Myc degradation can be blocked by oncogenic mutations in Ras family GTPases that constitutively maintain Ras in an active state (17Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Oncogenic H-Ras signaling promotes c-Myc stability in two ways; first, it induces Ser-62 phosphorylation by activating ERK through the MAPK pathway, and second, it blocks Thr-58 phosphorylation by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (12Sears R.

The well established cooperation between c-Myc and oncogenic Ras in promoting cellular transformation (18Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar) may in part be due to Ras-mediated stabilization of c-Myc (17Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Like c-Myc, N-Myc can cooperate with oncogenic H-Ras and K-Ras to transform normal embryonic fibroblasts into cells with tumorigenic potential (19Yancopoulos G.D. Nisen P.D. Tesfaye A. Kohl N.E.

Biochem. 1998; 124: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying cooperation between N-Myc and oncogenic Ras was suggested to be due to Ras-mediated stabilization of N-Myc (21Yaari S. Jacob-Hirsch J. Amariglio N. Haklai R. Rechavi G. Kloog Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 4321-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is a reasonable assumption, because the Ser and Thr phosphorylation sites in MBI of c-Myc that control its degradation are conserved in N-Myc (the equivalent sites in the mouse N-Myc homolog being Thr-50 and Ser-54). However, several studies call into question whether N-Myc degradation is controlled in the same manner as c-Myc. First, Kenney et al. (22Kenney A.M. Widlund H.R. Rowitch D.H. Development. 2004; 131: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) found that mutating N-Myc Ser-54 to alanine stabilized N-Myc, whereas mutation of the equivalent site in c-Myc, Ser-62, to alanine destabilizes c-Myc (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Second, protein phosphatase 2A activity promotes c-Myc degradation (14Yeh E. Cunningham M. Arnold H. Chasse D. Monteith T. Ivaldi G. Hahn W.C. Stukenberg P.T. Shenolikar S. Uchida T. Counter C.M. Nevins J.R. Means A.R. Sears R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) but appears to stabilize N-Myc (23Sjostrom S.K. Finn G. Hahn W.C. Rowitch D.H. Kenney A.M. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finally, although the prolyl isomerase Pin1 appears to control protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Ser-62 of c-Myc (15Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H. Ishida N. Okumura F. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), Pin1 does not alter the phosphorylation status of the equivalent Ser-54 of N-Myc in mouse neuronal precursors (23Sjostrom S.K. Finn G. Hahn W.C. Rowitch D.H. Kenney A.M. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 327-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although these differences in regulation might be attributable to different cell types or the specific conditions in which the studies were conducted, they might also reflect fundamental differences in how c-Myc and N-Myc respond to the activation of growth factor receptors and the activities of oncogenic Ras. To address this issue, we specifically examined how growth factor signaling and oncogenic Ras controls N-Myc protein levels and activity and compared this to c-Myc. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and oncogenic Ras similarly triggered robust N-Myc and c-Myc accumulation, but in contrast to c-Myc, we found no evidence that N-Myc accumulation was due to enhanced protein stability. To the contrary, oncogenic Ras promoted N-Myc turnover and its increased accumulation was instead associated with a marked increase in N-Myc translation. Furthermore, we show that proteasomal degradation of N-Myc and c-Myc is associated with enhanced transcriptional activity. Our results suggest that hyperactivated growth factor and Ras signaling may promote oncogenesis in N-Myc-expressing cells by coupling augmented N-Myc translation with N-Myc proteolysis and transcriptional activity. SK-N-BE(2) cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen), SMS-KCNR cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), and C3H 10T½ cells (ATCC) and EcoPack 2-293 cells (Clontech) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen). All cell lines were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin. For inhibitor assays, cells were treated with the following compounds: cycloheximide (CHX; 100 μg/ml), MG132 (10 μm, unless otherwise indicated), PD98059 (50 μm), UO126 (10 μm), SB230508 (10 μm), or LY249002 (50 μm) (all from Sigma). The following plasmids have been previously described (24Ota S. Zhou Z.Q. Link J.M. Hurlin P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2609-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar): pBABEpuro-c-Myc (c-Myc NCBI accession number ABW69847), pBABEpuro-GFP, pFBneo-WT-FGFR2c (Bek), pFBneo-FGFR2cK659E, pFBneo-GFP, pLXSN-FGFR2cS252W, and pBABEpuro-H-RasG12V. For pBABEpuro-N-Myc, the mouse N-Myc cDNA (coding sequence only, NCBI accession number AAH49783) was cloned into BamHI and EcoRV sites of pBABEpuro. Mutant N-Myc (N-MycT50A, N-MycT50D, N-MycS54A, and N-MycS54D) and c-Myc (c-MycT58A, c-MycT58D, c-MycS62A, and c-MycS62D) genes were generated from the pBABEpuro-N-Myc or pBABEpuro-c-Myc plasmids using the Change-IT Multiple Mutation site-directed mutagenesis kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To construct pcDNA6 N-Myc, N-Myc was amplified from pBABEpuro-N-Myc with primers that added NotI sites and cloned into the NotI site of pcDNA6. The pcDNA6-H-RasG12V plasmid was constructed by removing H-RasG12V from pBABEpuro-H-RasG12V using BamHI and EcoRI and inserting it into pcDNA6. The full-length N-Myc mouse cDNA (obtained from OpenBiosystems) was cloned into pcDNA6 using EcoRI and NotI sites. Viral infection and the establishment of stable cell lines were performed as previously described (24Ota S. Zhou Z.Q. Link J.M. Hurlin P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 2609-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For stable cell lines expressing more than one ectopic gene, cells were infected with a second virus 24 h after the initial infection. Cells were selected with puromycin (1 mg/ml), Geneticin (1 mg/ml), or both after all rounds of infection. Transient transfections in the C3H 10T½ and neuroblastoma cell lines were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according the manufacture's protocol. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of protein were separated on 4–12% Novex Bis-Tris acrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) using the following antibodies: N-Myc (C-19), c-Myc (9E10), c-Myc (N-262), BEK (C1–7), and phospho-Erk1/2 (E-4) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Ras (Ras10) from Upstate Biotechnology; actin (Ac-40) from Sigma; green fluorescent protein (GFP; ab290) and phospho-c-Myc (S62) from Abcam; phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phospho-eIF4E (Ser-209), phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (S9), phospho-c-Myc (Thr-58/Ser-62), and phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389) from Cell Signaling Technology. Quantitation of protein expression was performed by densitometry. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000c instrument (Thermo Scientific). cDNA was generated from 1 μg of RNA sample using the SuperScript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out using 1 μl of cDNA per sample and 0.2–0.3 μm concentrations of each primer. Each target was amplified using an empirically determined cycle number allowing for gel-based visualization of samples within the exponential amplification phase of each reaction. Equivalent volumes of each PCR reaction were separated through 1.2% Tris borate-EDTA-agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) expression analysis was performed with 10–30×-diluted cDNA (prepared as described above) using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and analyzed with an iQ5 Real-Time PCR detection System (Bio-Rad). All reactions were carried out in triplicate, and measurements were analyzed using the relative quantization 2−ΔΔCt method with actin as the calibrator. Stable C3H 10T½ cell lines were seeded at 6 × 105 per 10-cm dish 48 h before labeling. Transfected cells were labeled 24 h after transfection. Where indicated, transfected cells were treated with DMSO or the indicated inhibitor 2 h before and during labeling. Cells were starved of l-methionine and l-cysteine by incubation for 15 min in l-methionine/l-cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and l-glutamine (20 mm). After starvation, cells were labeled with 250 μCi/ml (for stable cells) or 100 μCi/ml (for transfected cells) of [35S]methionine/cysteine (MP Bio) at 37 °C for 30 min for protein stability assays or as indicated in protein synthesis assays. For stability assays, metabolically labeled cells were washed twice with cold “chase” media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 15 mg/liter l-methionine, and 20 mg/liter l-cysteine) and then incubated in chase media for the indicated times. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were incubated at 4 °C overnight with 1 μg of antibody against N-Myc (NCM100-II, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology for ectopically expressed c-Myc, or N-262, Santa Cruz Biotechnology for endogenous c-Myc), or GFP (ab290, Abcam) and then incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h with G plus-agarose beads. Immune complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized using a low intensity phosphor screen. Quantification of immunoprecipitated proteins was performed by densitometry using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Background values were calculated from an equivalent area in each lane and subtracted from the signal value for the labeled protein. Data points were plotted on a linear scale with time 0 being set at 100%. The protein half-life was calculated using a one-phase decay equation (GraphPad Prism). The -fold change in translation rate was defined as the rate of protein accumulation for oncogenic Ras-expressing cells divided by the rate of protein accumulation for control cells. Cells (5 × 106) were plated in 15-cm culture dishes and grown for 48 h. Before harvest, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and collected into Wash Buffer A (110 mm potassium acetate, 2.0 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml CHX). Cells were pelleted, resuspended in a hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml CHX, 1× protease inhibitor mixture), and lysed by passing cells through a 22-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged, and the resulting cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was separated through a sucrose gradient (17–51%) by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm with a SW-41-Ti Rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) for 120 min at 4 °C. Gradients were then collected into 12 equal fractions (Bio-Rad system), whereas the absorbance at 254 nm was continuously monitored (Kipp & Zonen chart recorder). Total RNA from each fraction was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation followed by DNase treatment. A one-third volume of total RNA was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to assess RNA quality and the distribution of tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA. The remaining two-thirds of total RNA was used for RT-PCR analysis as described above. Semiquantitative analysis of the polysome gradients was performed by measuring band intensities and subtracting the background readings from equivalent areas using ImageQuant Version 7. HEK 293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar) with expression vectors or control empty vector together with pGL2M4 reporter plasmid (26Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1993; 72: 211-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and pCMV β-galactosidase reporter. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with MG132 (5 μm) for 1 h, and the luciferase activity was assessed using the Dual-Light system (Applied Biosystems) on a Centro XS3 LB Microplate Luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Luciferase activity was adjusted for β-galactosidase activity. Our finding that loss of N-Myc disrupted proximal-distal patterning of the developing mouse limb buds (27Ota S. Zhou Z.Q. Keene D.R. Knoepfler P. Hurlin P.J. Development. 2007; 134: 1583-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a process controlled by FGF signaling prompted our initial interest in investigating if and how FGF signaling controls N-Myc expression. N-Myc is not expressed in C3H 10T½ cells, and we first tested whether FGF stimulation of the mouse mesenchymal cell line C3H 10T½ could induce N-Myc transcription. FGF2 treatment activated FGF signaling based on phosphorylation of FGF receptor (FGFR) (supplemental Fig. S1), but N-Myc was not induced. However, when an N-Myc cDNA containing only the coding region was expressed ectopically, FGF2 addition induced high levels of N-Myc protein (Fig. 1A). Induction of N-Myc protein occurred post-transcriptionally as N-myc mRNA levels were unaffected by FGF2 (Fig. 1B). Both the MAPK and PI3K pathways were stimulated in response FGF2 addition (supplemental Fig. S1), and we used pharmacological inhibitors to delineate which pathway(s) was involved in the induction of N-Myc. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway with PD98059 or UO126 prevented N-Myc induction, whereas inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 had no effect on N-Myc protein levels (Fig. 1C). Chemical inhibition of other downstream targets of the MAPK and PI3K pathways, such as Mnk1 by CPG 57380 and mTOR by rapamycin, did not alter N-Myc protein levels (data not shown). Therefore, in this system FGF signaling functions through the MAPK pathway to increase N-Myc protein levels. To further establish a link between FGFR activation and N-Myc up-regulation, we examined the effect of two FGFR2 mutants associated with cancer and developmental defects: FGFR2S252W and FGFR2K659E. FGFR2S252W, which has broadened ligand binding specificity and increased ligand affinity, causes the developmental disorder Apert syndrome and is found in some cancers (28Jang J.H. Shin K.H. Park J.G. Cancer Research. 2001; 61: 3541-3543PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dutt A. Salvesen H.B. Chen T.H. Ramos A.H. Onofrio R.C. Hatton C. Nicoletti R. Winckler W. Grewal R. Hanna M. Wyhs N. Ziaugra L.

A. 2008; 105: 8713-8717Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). FGFR2K659E is a ligand-independent, constitutively active mutant that has been found in uterine cancer (30Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 33: 233-237PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of FGFR2S252W or FGFR2K659E into C3H 10T½ cells elevated ectopic N-Myc protein levels over that of WT FGFR2 (Fig. 1D), and N-Myc induction by the mutant receptors required activation of the MAPK pathway (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results indicate that the MAPK pathway is responsible for the post-transcriptional-mediated increase in N-Myc that is stimulated by FGFR signaling. Previous studies conducted with c-Myc showed that mutant-activated H-Ras promoted its stability as mentioned above (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). We, therefore, used a constitutively active form of H-Ras, H-RasG12V (or oncogenic Ras), to further investigate how MAPK signaling up-regulates N-Myc and whether this was due to increased N-Myc protein stability. Similar to what was observed with FGF2 treatment, H-RasG12V increased N-Myc protein levels but had little effect on N-myc transcript levels (Fig. 2, A and B). Using CHX to block de novo protein synthesis, we monitored the rate of N-Myc degradation and were surprised to find that H-RasG12V consistently reduced the half-life of N-Myc (Fig. 2C). To control for potential off-target effects by CHX, N-Myc turnover was also examined by [35S]methionine pulse-chase analysis. Like the CHX experiments, pulse-chase analyses consistently showed that H-RasG12V accelerated N-Myc turnover (Fig. 2D). Because these findings are opposite to what has been described for c-Myc (12Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), we performed parallel studies with c-Myc. H-RasG12V increased the amount of ectopic c-Myc protein but did not affect c-myc transcript levels (Fig. 2, A and B), and consistent with published data, [35S]methionine pulse-chase analysis showed that H-RasG12V slowed c-Myc degradation (Fig. 2E). We conclude that oncogenic Ras has the opposite effect on N-Myc and c-Myc protein stability; it destabilizes N-Myc while stabilizing c-Myc. The observation that H-RasG12V elevated steady-state N-Myc protein levels without affecting N-myc mRNA levels but also accelerated N-Myc turnover suggested that H-RasG12V might act at the level of translation. To test this, we examined the rate of N-Myc protein synthesis by [35S]methionine pulse analysis. Newly synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled N-Myc protein accumulated faster in the presence of H-RasG12V and peaked at 20 min (Fig. 3A, left). The slight decrease in [35S]methionine-labeled N-Myc at 30 min was consistently observed in the H-RasG12V-expressing cells and is likely due to its already short, but further shortened half-life (17–23 min) in the presence of oncogenic Ras. In this 30-min assay, H-RasG12V increased the rate of N-Myc protein synthesis ∼2-fold (Fig. 3A, right), but this rate is likely greater as the accelerated rate of protein degradation is not factored into this calculation. In contrast to N-Myc, H-RasG12V did not affect the rate of ectopic or endogenous c-Myc protein synthesis (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S2). We considered that the increased rate of N-Myc protein synthesis might be due to H-RasG12V activity targeting elements within the vector used to expresses N-Myc (i.e. 3′-untranslated region promoter). To control for this possibility, the gene encoding GFP was expressed in the same expression vector, and the rate of GFP protein synthesis was determined. In contrast to N-Myc, the translation rate of GFP was n"
https://openalex.org/W2056912104,"ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related) contains 16 conserved candidate autophosphorylation sites that match its preferred S/TQ consensus. To determine whether any is functionally important, we mutated the 16 candidate residues to alanine in a single cDNA to create a 16A-ATR mutant. The 16A-ATR mutant maintains kinase and G(2) checkpoint activities. However, it fails to rescue the essential function of ATR in maintaining cell viability and fails to promote replication recovery from a transient exposure to replication stress. Further analysis identified T1566A/T1578A/T1589A (3A-ATR) as critical mutations causing this separation of function activity. Secondary structure predictions indicate that these residues occur in a region between ATR HEAT repeats 31R and 32R that aligns with regions of ATM and DNA-PK containing regulatory autophosphorylation sites. Although this region is important for ATR function, the 3A-ATR residues do not appear to be sites of autophosphorylation. Nevertheless, our analysis identifies an important regulatory region of ATR that is shared among the PI3K-related protein kinase family. Furthermore, our data indicate that the essential function of ATR for cell viability is linked to its function in promoting proper replication in the context of replication stress and is independent of G(2) checkpoint activity."
https://openalex.org/W1984787625,"Micro-RNAs are deregulated in cancer cells, and some are either tumor suppressive or oncogenic. In addition, a link has been established between decreased expression of micro-RNAs and transformation, and several proteins of the RNA interference pathway have been shown to be haploinsufficient tumor suppressors. Oncogenic micro-RNAs (oncomiRs) could represent new therapeutic targets, and their identification is therefore crucial. However, structural and functional redundancy between micro-RNAs hampers approaches relying on individual micro-RNA inhibition. We reasoned that in cancer cells that depend on oncomiRs, impairing the micro-RNA pathway could lead to growth perturbation rather than increased tumorigenesis. Identifying such cells could allow functional analyses of individual micro-RNAs by complementation of the phenotypes observed upon global micro-RNA inhibition. Therefore, we developed episomal vectors coding for small hairpin RNAs targeting either Drosha or DGCR8, the two components of the microprocessor, the nuclear micro-RNA maturation complex. We identified cancer cell lines in which both vectors induced colony growth arrest. We then screened for individual micro-RNAs complementing this growth arrest, and identified miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-27b as major growth-sustaining micro-RNAs. However, the effect of miR-19a and miR-19b was only transient. In addition, embryonic stem cell-derived micro-RNAs with miR-20a seeds were much less efficient than miR-20a in sustaining cancer cell growth, a finding that contrasted with results obtained in stem cells. Finally, we showed that the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10, a shared target of miR-19 and miR-20, was functionally involved in the growth arrest induced by microprocessor inhibition. We conclude that our approach allowed to identify microprocessor-dependent cancer cells, which could be used to screen for growth-sustaining micro-RNAs. This complementation screen unveiled functional differences between homologous micro-RNAs. Phenotypic characterization of the complemented cells will allow precise functional studies of these micro-RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2001567818,"Temperate bacteriophage lytic development is intrinsically related to the stress response in particular at the DNA replication and virion maturation steps. Alternatively, temperate phages become lysogenic and integrate their genome into the host chromosome. Under stressful conditions, the prophage resumes a lytic development program, and the phage DNA is excised before being replicated. The KplE1 defective prophage of Escherichia coli K12 constitutes a model system because it is fully competent for integrative as well as excisive recombination and presents an atypical recombination module, which is conserved in various phage genomes. In this work, we identified the host-encoded stress-responsive molecular chaperone DnaJ (Hsp40) as an active participant in KplE1 prophage excision. We first show that the recombination directionality factor TorI of KplE1 specifically interacts with DnaJ. In addition, we found that DnaJ dramatically enhances both TorI binding to its DNA target and excisive recombination in vitro. Remarkably, such stimulatory effect by DnaJ was performed independently of its DnaK chaperone partner and did not require a functional DnaJ J-domain. Taken together, our results underline a novel and unsuspected functional interaction between the generic host stress-regulated chaperone and temperate bacteriophage lysogenic development."
