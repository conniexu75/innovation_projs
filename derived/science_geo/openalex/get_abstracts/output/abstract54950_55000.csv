https://openalex.org/W1553982335,"Abstract The interaction between human plasma lipoproteins and glycosaminoglycans has been studied by use of gels consisting of cross-linked hyaluronic acid and of sulfated glycosaminoglycans covalently attached to agarose (Sepharose 4B). When chromatographed on a column of granulated hyaluronic acid gel at physiological pH and ionic strength, very low density (VLDL), low density (LDL), and high density (HDL) lipoproteins were shown to emerge with the void volume, indicating that no significant binding to the polysaccharide had occurred. Equilibration of the same lipoproteins with glycosaminoglycan-substituted agarose gels at pH 7.4 showed that VLDL as well as LDL were bound to gels containing heparin, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin 4-sulfate, provided the ionic strength was sufficiently low. In contrast, HDL and acetylated specimens of VLDL and LDL did not bind to the gels at any ionic strength. The observed interactions have been interpreted as an ionic binding of positively charged amino groups on apolipoprotein B to negatively charged groups on the glycosaminoglycans. The range of ionic strength at which each lipoprotein was released from a polysaccharide was relatively narrow and depended on the type of polysaccharide. For the release of half the amounts of VLDL, or LDL, bound to gels of heparin, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin 4-sulfate, ionic strengths of 0.26, 0.15, 0.09, and 0.08, respectively, were required. The results were interpreted in terms of an electrostatic binding between polyvalent anionic and cationic sites with the charge density of the polysaccharide being an important parameter for the strength of the ionic bond. At equal charge density, polysaccharides containing l-iduronic acid seemed to interact more strongly than those containing d-glucuronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1574835894,"Abstract Paramagnetic complexes of iron (III), manganese (II), and cobalt (II) protoporphyrins IX and apohemoproteins react with nitric oxide to form spectroscopically distinct compounds. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies suggest that a 1-electron transfer between nitric oxides and metal ions which occurs in these reactions results in the formation of spin-paired complexes of these metalloporphyrins with nitric oxide. However, manganese (III) and cobalt (III) protoporphyrin-apohemoprotein complexes do not react with nitric oxide. Ferrous hemoproteins react reversibly with nitric oxide to form paramagnetic complexes, which exhibit an intense EPR absorption centered around g = 2.0. The complexes of nitric oxide with ferrous cytochrome c peroxidase and horseradish peroxidase show well defined EPR absorptions with rhombic symmetry (gx = 2.08, gy = 1.96, and gz = 2.004). The hyperfine structure in the z absorption has been analyzed through isotope substitutions with 15NO and 57Fe-enriched heme. It is concluded that the unpaired electron of nitric oxide is considerably delocalized and that the proximal ligand of both peroxidases is a nitrogen-containing group, probably a histidyl residue. Hemoproteins have been arbitrarily classed into two groups on the basis of the EPR characteristics of their nitric oxide complexes: Type I (gy l 1.96) and Type II (gy g 1.97). Cytochrome c peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase, and lactoperoxidase belong to Type I, whereas cytochrome oxidase, catalase, cytochrome c, hemoglobin, and myoglobin belong to Type II. EPR parameters of nitric oxide complexes of ferrous hemoproteins are not significantly affected by substitutions of two vinyl groups (protoheme) at positions 2 and 4 of the porphyrin ring with two ethyl groups (mesoheme) or hydrogens (deuteroheme), indicating that the nucleophilicity of porphyrin side chains has no appreciable effect on the metal-ligand bond strength."
https://openalex.org/W2049851008,Thalamocortical relay neurons whose axons project into a penicillininduced cortical epileptogenic focus generate bursts of action potentials during spontaneous interictal epileptiform discharges. These bursts originate in intracortical axons and propagate antidromically into thalamic neurons. Repetitive spike generation in cortical axons and presynaptic terminals could produce a potent excitatory drive and contribute to the generation of the large depolarization shifts which are seen in cortical elements during focal epileptogenesis.
https://openalex.org/W1527526272,"The response of several Escherichia coli membranous enzymes to hydrolysis of up to 95% of membrane phospholipid has been investigated. Purified phospholipase C of Bacillus cereus was utilized in these studies. The rate and extent of digestion of E. coli phospholipids was independent of whether the lipid was associated with membrane protein or extracted from membranes and sonically dispersed. Phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were completely hydrolyzed, while cardiolipin was partially resistant to hydrolysis by phospholipase C. Acyl-CoA:glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase and NADH oxidase were inactivated at a rate very similar to the rate of hydrolysis of total lipids. Acyl-CoA:1-acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase was inactivated to an extent of 50% during hydrolysis of 50% of membrane phospholipid. The remaining activity was stable to continued hydrolysis of phospholipid. Glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase remained completely active after hydrolysis of 95% of membrane phospholipids. These results show the heterogeneity of membranous enzymes with respect to their dependence upon the presence of intact membrane phospholipids. The lack of effect of membranous lipid-protein interactions on the accessibility of phospholipids to phospholipase C hydrolysis was shown in general by the similarity in the rates of hydrolysis by phospholipase C of membranous and isolated phospholipids. More specifically, the similarity in the rate of hydrolysis of phospholipids and the rates of inactivation of certain membranous enzymes suggests that these enzymes are dependent on phospholipids whose susceptibility to phospholipase C hydrolysis is similar to the bulk of membrane phospholipids."

This inhibition is rapid, reversible, and is achieved at very low concentrations of the metabolite. Cytochalasin A also inhibits sugar uptake, but the magnitude and reversibility of inhibition differs from that produced by cytochalasin B."
https://openalex.org/W1496684118,"Abstract The interaction of human plasma high density apolipoproteins (apoHDL) with lipids was examined by circular dichroism (CD) of the peptide and aromatic chromophores. By CD criteria native HDL contained about 70% α helical, 5 to 15% β, and 15 to 20% disordered structure. Delipidation decreased the helical content by about 20% with a corresponding increase in disordered structure. The two major apoproteins of HDL (apoA-I and apoA-II), isolated by chromatography in urea, refolded to different extents after removal of urea; apoA-I had more ordered structure than apoA-II (approximately 55% and 35% α helix, respectively). Reconstitution of apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoHDL with both phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl ester restored, respectively, 119%, 87%, and 100% of the helical structure of the parent HDL. Phosphatidylcholine alone restored 50 to 70% of the increase produced by both phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl oleate. With each substrate, the increase in helical content on lipid-protein recombination was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in disordered structure. Spectra of HDL in the near-ultraviolet range showed peaks at 258, 264, 283.5, and 290.5 nm. Delipidation reduced and markedly altered the ellipticity bands of the near-ultraviolet CD spectrum. The bands at 283.5 and 290.5 nm, tentatively assigned to one or more of the tryptophan chromophores in apoA-I, were reversed in sign and shifted to 286 and 292 nm, respectively. The near-ultraviolet CD spectrum of the parent HDL was partially restored by recombination of apoHDL with phosphatidylcholine alone and almost completely restored by recombination with both phosphatidylcholine and cholesteryl oleate. Recombination with phosphatidylcholine alone was sufficient to restore the 286 and 292 nm peaks to their original sign and position. These studies indicate that about 20 to 30% of the amino acid residues in the two major HDL apoproteins are involved in a helix-disordered transition on lipid removal or restoration. The near-ultraviolet CD spectrum is especially sensitive to these lipid-induced structural changes. Both phospholipid and cholesteryl esters are required for complete reorganization of the secondary and tertiary structure of HDL."
https://openalex.org/W1498996659,"Abstract Suspensions of rat liver cells from starved rats converted three carbon precursors to glucose and responded to hormones such as glucagon and insulin. Cells were isolated by perfusion of rat livers with calcium-free Hanks' solution containing 0.01 g% of collagenase and 0.08 g% of hyaluronidase in the presence of 4% defatted albumin. Cells from 18- to 24-hour starved rats synthesized glucose de novo from l-alanine at rates comparable to those observed in the perfused liver. Glucagon increased cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in liver cells with the maximal effect being observed some 2 min after its addition. In cells from fed rats there was an immediate increase due to glucagon of glucose release which could be accounted for by glycogenolysis. In cells from starved rats there was almost no glycogen (0.5% for starved rats as compared to 7.5% for fed rats), and there was a 20-min lag period before glucose output was increased by glucagon. Glucagon stimulated gluconeogenesis in the presence of alanine, lactate, or pyruvate whereas added fatty acids inhibited gluconeogenesis from alanine and stimulated that from lactate or pyruvate. Insulin increased glycogen deposition in cells from starved rats, and this accounted for the decrease in glucose output seen with insulin. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP also stimulated gluconeogenesis in isolated liver cells. The effects of insulin and glucagon on liver cells were abolished by short term treatment of cell suspensions with trypsin. In contrast, the response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP was not altered in the trypsin-treated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524156212,"Abstract 1. In an attempt to evaluate the significance of the latency, which is characteristic of the various phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase reactions catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphatase, a detailed study was undertaken of the specificity of the enzyme before and after liver microsomes were disrupted by the addition of detergent or exposure to high pH. Activities with PPi, carbamyl-P, mannose-6-P, ATP, glucosamine-6-P, 2-deoxy-d-glucose-6-P, and glucose-6-P were examined. 2. The following observations were made. (a) With the exception of the activities with PPi and glucose-6-P, all reactions catalyzed by glucose 6-phosphatase of untreated microsomes showed levels of latency in excess of 85%. Mild heating (30°) at pH 5.5 caused some unmasking of the activities and PPi potentiated this effect. Since these are the conditions of assay in untreated microsomes the manifestation of activities with PPi appear to be artifacts and glucose-6-P hydrolysis remains as the only activity with a low level of latency. (b) The Michaelis constant for glucose-6-P was markedly reduced by disruption of microsomes while Michaelis constants for the other substrates were unaffected. (c) Compounds which were good substrates in disrupted preparations (e.g. mannose-6-P, PPi, and carbamyl-P) were weak inhibitors of glucose-6-P hydrolysis by untreated microsomes. In contrast, glucose-6-P was an equally potent inhibitor of mannose-6-P hydrolysis with either treated or untreated microsomal preparations. (d) Disruption of microsomal structure markedly reduced the energy of activation of glucose-6-P phosphohydrolase without altering the value for the activation energy of mannose-6-P phosphohydrolase. 3. These observations can be explained by a model for glucose 6-phosphatase in which the enzyme is positioned within the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in an orientation that permits interaction of the catalytic site with glucose-6-P but excludes other phosphate substrates, unless the membrane is disrupted. Fresh, untreated microsomes are considered to consist of two forms: (a) intact structures in which the enzyme is specific for glucose-6-P and (b) disrupted structures in which the enzyme is broadly specific. Exposures to hypotonic media, extremes of pH, detergents, or ultrasound increase the proportion of the disrupted form. 4. We suggest that the physiologically functional form of the enzyme is specific for glucose-6-P."
https://openalex.org/W1562597048,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase was studied in plasma membranes prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle. Such preparations represented an increase in specific activity of 10- to 20-fold over the whole homogenate with a yield of activity of approximately 30%. Various parameters, such as phase contrast microscopy, marker enzyme activities, and chemical composition, suggested that the preparation constituted sarcolemma in a high degree of purity. The Km for substrate (MgATP) was 0.3 to 0.5 mm. The Ka for Mg2+ was 3 to 5 mm. Binding of Mg2+ to a second site resulted in increased reactivity of the catalytic site for substrate. Stimulation by fluoride resulted from an increase in maximal velocity; the Ka for Mg2+ and the Km for substrate were not appreciably altered. The effect of F- was markedly temperature-sensitive and partially irreversible. Fluoride-stimulated activity was particularly sensitive to inhibition by pyrophosphate and this inhibition was competitive with respect to ATP (Ki, 0.45 mm). Catecholamines stimulated the enzyme in a typical β adrenergic fashion. The prominent kinetic effect of epinephrine was (like F-) to increase reaction velocity without affecting affinity for Mg2+ or ATP. The regulation of adenylate cyclase in skeletal muscle may be classified as a V allosteric system since metal ions, F-, and epinephrine all result in increased maximal velocity of the enzyme reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1588048142,"Abstract The subcellular distribution of phosphoprotein phosphatases which release orthophosphate from phosphoprotein was studied in rat cerebral cortex. In contrast to several other tissues examined, more than 50% of the total protein phosphatase activity in rat cerebral cortex was found in the particulate fractions; the activity was especially high in the crude mitochondrial fraction. Further subfractionation of the crude mitochondrial fraction by sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that, among the membrane fractions, the specific activity of protein phosphatase was highest in the fractions rich in synaptic membranes and lowest in the mitochondria. A considerable amount of the enzyme activity in synaptic and microsomal membranes existed in a latent form which could be partially unmasked by treatment with Triton X-100. The specific activity of the protein phosphatase of the cell sap and of the synaptoplasm was considerably higher than that of the membrane fractions. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose resolved the protein phosphatase activity of the cell sap into three distinct protein phosphatases, which were clearly distinguished from membrane enzyme by differences in substrate specificity and metal ion requirements. The soluble protein phosphatases, but not the enzyme released from the synaptic plasma membrane fraction by Triton X-100 treatment, were specifically activated by manganese chloride. Endogenous membrane protein was found to be the best among several phosphorylated proteins examined as substrates for membrane-bound protein phosphatase. Both membrane-bound and soluble protein phosphatase exhibited pH optima in the neutral range. Protein phosphatase catalyzed the stoichiometric release of orthophosphate from a phosphoserine residue of protamine. This was the only amino acid residue in protamine and histones which appeared to be phosphorylated by an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase purified from bovine brain."
https://openalex.org/W1488112422,"Abstract Structural changes at the active site of creatine kinase which occur upon binding of substrates and inhibitory anions have been examined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and proton relaxation rate (PRR) studies of manganous complexes with the enzyme. EPR spectra for solutions of ternary complexes involving enzyme and Mn(II)-nucleotides are quite similar to those for the binary Mn(II)-nucleotide complexes in solution and in the solid state. However, there are significant changes in the EPR spectra upon addition of creatine to solutions of E-MnADP or to E-MnATP. The changes show that the binding of creatine induces a rearrangement at the active site which results in a more asymmetrical electronic environment for the Mn(II). Substitutions of ligand groups from the protein into the Mn(II) coordination sphere are suggested as a possible source of the spectral changes. Anions such as nitrate and chloride produce further changes in the EPR spectrum of E-Mn-ADP-creatine and decrease the PRR of water for this complex. The anions apparently bind at the vacant phosphoryl site in the abortive quaternary complex, and their binding induces additional structural changes. Considerable specificity is observed in the effectiveness of various anions on the EPR spectrum or on the PRR of water, nitrate inducing the maximal effect. Experiments with modified substrates show that even minor differences e.g. dADP versus ADP in the molecular structure of the substrates bound to the enzyme are reflected in the EPR spectrum of Mn(II) at the active site. Creatine kinase modified at the essential sulfhydryl groups by reaction with iodoacetamide does not undergo a conformational response upon addition of either creatine or creatine and anions to solutions of its ternary complex with MnADP."
https://openalex.org/W1762551473,"Abstract Human low density lipoprotein (LDL) was prepared by successive ultracentrifugations of serum at different densities. Apo-LDL, prepared by delipidation of LDL by successive extractions with ethanol-ether and ether, was reduced and carboxymethylated in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of apo-LDL was determined by three methods: sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, equilibrium ultracentrifugation in 7.6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and Sepharose 4B gel filtration in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The molecular weights, as determined by the first two methods, were 255,000 ± 10% and 250,000 ± 5%, respectively. As the polypeptide eluted close to the void volume on the gel filtration column only a range of 275,000 ± 15,000 can be established for its molecular weight. However, significantly, these chromatographic experiments indicated the absence of smaller components. The data provide evidence that only two polypeptide chains, of equal size, can be found in LDL (native molecular weight 2.7 x 106, 20% protein by weight), and that these chains are not aggregates of smaller polypeptide chains. These results are not consistent with the model for LDL proposed by Pollard, H., Scanu, A. M., and Taylor, E. W. ((1969) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 64, 304)."

This enzyme has been isolated and has been found to be a blue-green, copper- and zinc-containing enzyme, similar to that already described from bovine tissues and from garden peas. The molecular weight was approximately 31,000, and the enzyme appeared to be composed of 2 subunits of equal size joined only by noncovalent interractions. The Neurospora enzyme contains two Cu++ and two Zn++ per molecule. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum indicates a lack of tryptophan. Amino acid analyses are reported as are the spectral and catalytic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1657809798,Activation of K+-dependent p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity occurs concurrently with inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity when either glycerol or dimethyl sulfoxide is added to the reaction medium. The effects on both activities are reversible. The Na+-dependent ADP-ATP phosphotransferase reaction and K+-dependent acetyl phosphatase activities are also inhibited by dimethyl sulfoxide. The effects of these solvents are consistent with a decreased interaction of phosphokinase and phosphatase sites with the phosphoryl acceptor site and an increased accessibility of p-nitrophenylphosphate to the phosphatase site.
https://openalex.org/W1612399653,"Abstract The levels of activity of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (1.1.1.34), mevalonate kinase (2.7.1.36), phosphomevalonate kinase (2.7.4.2), pyrophosphomevalonate decarboxylase (4.1.1.33), isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase (5.3.3.2), dimethylallyltransferase (2.5.1.1), and squalene synthetase, and the rates of conversion of [2-14C]-acetate and [2-14C]mevalonate to nonsaponifiable compounds and digitonin-precipitable sterols have been measured in subcellular fractions of livers of rats that were either fasted or fasted and refed a fat-free diet. These activities were also measured in subcellular fractions of livers of rats at varying times of day. Only β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and the activity for the conversion of acetate to cholesterol showed a significant diurnal variation. In contrast, all the enzyme activities tested except mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase declined rapidly on fasting and then returned to normal or above-normal levels during refeeding. The variation in the level of β-hydroxy-β-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase activity under these conditions is sufficient to account for the variation observed in the conversion of acetate to cholesterol by liver homogenates. However, the changes in the rate of conversion of mevalonate to cholesterol and the behavior of the intermediate enzymes indicate that there are at least two secondary regulatory processes active in controlling the flux of material through this pathway. Rate constants were estimated for the formation and break-down of each of the enzymes except the kinases during the fasting state and for squalene synthetase during the refeeding state. The enzymes of the segment of the pathway of cholesterol synthesis studied are not coordinately controlled."
https://openalex.org/W1505117697,"Abstract Liver plasma membranes rapidly convert glucagon, at physiological concentrations, to a substance that no longer binds to its specific binding sites or activates adenylate cyclase. Inactivation occurs in the presence of albumin and is not completely blocked by a 1000-fold excess of insulin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and secretin. Des-His-glucagon, which competitively inhibits binding of glucagon and activation of adenylate cyclase by the hormone, binds to liver membranes with an affinity approximately one-tenth that of glucagon. Binding of des-His-glucagon is also reduced after incubation with liver membranes but to a much lesser extent than is the binding of glucagon. As previously found for the processes of glucagon binding and activation of adenylate cyclase, the process of inactivation of glucagon is blocked by treatment of liver membranes with heat, urea, trypsin, or phospholipase A. The specific activity of the glucagon-inactivation process increases to the same extent as does glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the membranes compared to a 1500 x g sediment of liver homogenate. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I, a soluble liver enzyme which can degrade glucagon, is present in the membrane fraction but is not responsible for glucagon inactivation by the membranes, to which the inactivation process is firmly bound. The product of glucagon inactivation has not been identified but is very similar to glucagon in its chromatographic behavior and appears not to be des-His-glucagon. These findings indicate that liver plasma membranes may be an important site for specific inactivation of glucagon. A possible relationship between the glucagon inactivation process and the receptor for glucagon is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526034428,"Abstract The primary sequence of nucleotides has been defined for 4.5 S RNAi, which is one type of low molecular weight nuclear RNA of Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells. This RNA is the first unique nuclear species of mammalian RNA to be sequenced. It is specifically localized to the extranucleolar portion of the nucleus and is not a precursor of tRNA. Highly labeled 4.5 S RNAi was obtained from cells incubated with [32P]orthophosphate in vitro. The RNA was purified by successive gel electrophoresis and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex. The primary sequence of nucleotides of this RNA shows that it has a purine-rich 5' end and a pyrimidine-rich 3' end: [see PDF for sequence]."
https://openalex.org/W1546218730,"Abstract Sialidase activity towards ganglioside substrate, including hematoside, paralleled activity of 5'-nucleotidase and was found to be enriched in the plasma membrane fractions (Touster, O., Aronson, N. N., Jr., Dulaney, J. T., and Hendrickson, M. (1970) J. Cell. Biol. 47, 604) prepared from rat liver cells. Lesser sialidase activity towards ganglioside substrate was found in fractions (Leighton, F., Poole, B., Beaufay, H., Baudhuin, P., Coffey, J. W., Fowler, S., and deDuve, C. (1968) J. Cell. Biol. 37, 482) containing the lysosomal marker, acid phosphatase. Concentration of gangliosides, and total bound sialic acid per mg of protein, also paralleled the plasma membrane marker, 5'-nucleotidase. Subcellular fractions were prepared from rat liver cells by a recently developed procedure (Touster et al.) which favors the isolation of the plasma membrane fraction, and by an independent method (Leighton et al.) favoring the isolation of lysosomes. These findings indicate that a major fraction of sialidase with activity towards ganglioside substrate is localized in the plasma membrane of the liver cell, and that ganglioside substrate is also localized in this cellular structure."

https://openalex.org/W1546158912,"Embryonic chick calvaria (cranial bones) were cultured in the presence of [35S]cysteine and labeled procollagen, a collagen precursor, was isolated. Incorporation of the 35S label in the pro-α1 chain of procollagen permitted its use as a relatively specific marker for the chain during purification, since neither the α1 nor the α2 chain of collagen contains cysteine. Determinations of the molecular weight of pro-α1 by calibrated molecular sieve chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a value of 115,000 in good agreement with previous estimates using [3H]proline-labeled chains. Collagenase digestion of [35S]cysteine- and [3H]proline-labeled pro-α1 chains revealed that the additional non-triple helical sequence of the precursor chain is divided into (a) collagenase-resistant regions which contain cysteine and little or no proline and (b) collagenase-susceptible regions lacking cysteine and containing proline but not hydroxyproline. Amino acid analysis of the pro-α1 chain confirmed the presence of 5 or 6 half-cystines per chain and revealed a composition which differs considerably from that of collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1540110578,"Abstract 1. The effects of deoxycholate, cholate, taurocholate, Triton X-100, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (cetrimide), and NH4OH on liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphatase have been investigated. Treatment of microsomal preparations with detergents activate and inhibit (not inactivate) the phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities of the enzyme. The inhibitory action of detergents was substantially reversed by the inclusion of bovine plasma albumin in the assay media. The glucose-binding site on the enzyme was implicated as a principal site of interaction of detergents with enzyme by the following observations. (a) The extent of inhibition by detergents was considerably more pronounced with the phosphotransferase activity, and (b) in the absence of albumin a substantial fraction of the PPi-phosphohydrolase activity of detergent-treated microsomes was insensitive to inhibition by glucose. Detergent treatment significantly decreased the Michaelis constant for glucose-6-P, and this decrease was potentiated by albumin. The Michaelis constants for PPi in both the phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase reactions also appeared to be decreased by treatments with detergents, particularly the anionic compounds. However, in the presence of albumin the values for Kppppi were equal to those of the untreated microsomes. The kinetic constants determined for NH4OH-treated microsomes were not altered by albumin and were identical with those obtained in the presence of albumin with detergent-treated microsomes. 2. In confirmation of earlier studies by others, cetrimide effected marked reductions in Km and Vmax values. These effects were found to be the result of uncompetitive inhibition by this cationic detergent. 3. The extent of inhibition by deoxycholate as well as the effectiveness of albumin in reversing the inhibition were identical with enzyme preparations from adrenalectomized, normal, and cortisol-treated animals. This finding strengthens the earlier conclusion that glucocorticoids in vivo stimulate activities of glucose 6-phosphatase by activating existing, but latent, enzyme. 4. An automated method for determining glucose-6-P is described."
https://openalex.org/W1583881275,"Abstract A new procedure is described for the solubilization and purification of nucleoside diphosphatase from rat liver microsomes. The enzyme was solubilized from microsomes by an alkaline treatment (pH 10.7) in the presence of a low concentration (0.05%) of sodium deoxycholate, and purified to a nearly homogeneous state by chromatographic procedures using DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-Sephadex, and hydroxylapatite. A rabbit antiserum was prepared against the purified nucleoside diphosphatase. The antibody gave a single precipitation line with the purified enzyme as well as with the crude enzyme preparation, and strongly inhibited the nucleoside diphosphate-hydrolyzing activity of purified enzyme preparations. The nucleoside diphosphatase in intact microsomes is in a latent state, and its activity is greatly stimulated by treatments which affect the lipoprotein membrane structure of microsomal vesicles. The activation and solubilization of the enzyme by various treatments were studied in detail, and it was concluded that the enzyme is bound to the inner surface of the membrane, enclosing the microsomal vesicles. The permeability barrier of the microsomal membrane to the substrate seems to be responsible for the latency of the enzyme in intact microsomes. This conclusion was supported by the following immunochemical experiments utilizing rabbit antiserum against the purified enzyme. The enzyme in intact microsomes failed to react with the antiserum, whereas the activity of solubilized enzyme was strongly inhibited by the antiserum. When microsomes were treated with phospholipase C, the nucleoside diphosphatase became susceptible to the inhibition by the antiserum. The proteolytic digestion of intact and phospholipase C-treated microsomes also gave results which were compatible with the supposed inside localization of the nucleoside diphosphatase in microsomal vesicles. The turnover rate of the enzyme in vivo was also determined by using the specific precipitation of the microsomal nucleoside diphosphatase with the antibody. The half-life of the enzyme was 1 to 1½ days which was considerably shorter than the half-life of total microsomal protein. This finding offers additional evidence for the independent turn-over of microsomal membrane components, as suggested in several recent publications."
https://openalex.org/W1542827339,"Abstract Physiological doses of radioactive vitamin D3 are administered to vitamin D-deficient chicks 16 hours prior to the preparation of lipid extracts of small intestine, plasma, kidney, and bone. Analysis of the vitamin D metabolite pattern is carried out via column chromatography on silicic acid, Sephadex LH-20, and Celite (liquid-liquid partition), countercurrent distribution and treatment with periodic acid. The predominant form of the vitamin in the intestine is a polar metabolite (Peak 4Bi) which is homogeneous in all four separation systems, migrates in the area of known dihydroxy-D3-vitamins, loses 46% of its tritium in the course of metabolic formation from [1α, 2α-3H2]vitamin D3 and is insensitive to cleavage by periodate. These data are consistent with the recent identification of Peak 4Bi as 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 by Holick, Schnoes, and DeLuca (1971) (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 68, 803) and the original proposal by Haussler, Myrtle, and Norman (1968) (J. Biol. Chem. 243, 4055) that this metabolite is the active form of vitamin D in the intestine. The major metabolite present in plasma, kidney, and bone is 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3, but significant amounts of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 are detected in all three sites. The plasma dihydroxy-vitamin D3-metabolite profile differs markedly from that of the kidney and bone in that the predominant species is 25, 26-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, with 21,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 also being present in measurable quantities. Virtually all dihydroxy-vitamin D3 in kidney and bone exists as the 1,25-dihydroxy derivative. The presence of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 in kidney strengthens the proposal that it is produced metabolically from 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 by a renal enzyme. The association of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 with bone and its considerable activity in promoting skeletal dissolution, raises the question as to whether 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 or the 1,25-dihydroxy-sterol represents the active form directing bone resorption."

https://openalex.org/W2113970272,"Aspartate transcarbamylase from a Pseudomonas fluorescens has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 360,000. It is composed of 2 apparently identical subunits with molecular weights of 180,000. Activity can be recovered from the enzyme denatured with mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate when the dodecyl sulfate is dialyzed away. The renatured enzyme has the molecular weight of the native enzyme. Carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity is lost continuously during purification, so that it is unlikely that this bacterium possesses a carbamyl phosphate synthetase-aspartate transcarbamylase complex such as is found in Neurospora and yeast. The kinetic and regulatory properties of aspartate transcarbamylase from P. fluorescens were also studied. The substrate saturation curves in the absence and presence of all inhibitors tested are hyperbolic. With limiting carbamyl phosphate, all trinucleotides tested, and CDP, pyrophosphate, and orthophosphate inhibit competitively at micromolar concentrations. When carbamyl phosphate is saturating a second binding site for the nucleotides is evident, but pyrophosphate and orthophosphate no longer inhibit. At millimolar concentrations, the nucleotides are noncompetitive inhibitors with aspartate. The function of this regulatory site cannot be separated from the catalytic site by mild heat treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1524844977,"Abstract Phospholipid changes which appear to be related to density-dependent inhibition of cell division were identified in cultured 3T3 mouse cells. After these cells grew to confluency, the rate of incorporation of phosphate into total phospholipids remained about the same. However, the rate for phosphatidylcholine increased 2-fold, while the rates for phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine decreased 7-fold and 2-fold, respectively. The phospholipid composition of nonconfluent and confluent 3T3 cells was about the same, indicating that these differences in incorporation reflected changes in turnover rates rather than rates of net synthesis. In addition, initiation of division of confluent 3T3 cells by fresh serum brought about some rapid phospholipid changes. This treatment resulted in increased incorporation of phosphate into all of the major cell phospholipids during the first 2 hours. It also brought about increased phosphate transport, but this could not account for all of the increased incorporation into phospholipids. The same changes did not take place in polyoma virus-transformed 3T3 (Py3T3) cells, and so they appear to be related to serum- and density-dependent growth control characteristic of 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1615878305,"Abstract Adenylate cyclase activity has been examined in adrenocortical tumor cell cultures which exhibit adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated steroidogenesis (Y-1) and in mutant adrenal cell lines which are insensitive to added ACTH (Y-6 and OS3). Adenylate cyclase activity is stimulated by ACTH in Y-1 cells but not in Y-6 or OS3 cells. The absence of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity accounts for the variant phenotypes of Y-6 and OS3 cells, and provides evidence for the obligatory roles of adenylate cyclase and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis. Adenylate cyclase is present in Y-6 and OS3 cells as evidenced by F--stimulated activity. The enzyme activities in the ACTH responsive and mutant cell lines are indistinguishable with respect to requirements for fluoride ion, pH optima, stability at 37°, optimum ATP:Mg2+ ratio, and apparent Km values. The enzyme from each of the three cell lines appears to utilize ATP·Mg as substrate. The lack of hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity in Y-6 and OS3 cells results from defects in ACTH receptors and/or in processes whereby the formation of ACTH receptor complexes is coupled to activation of adenylate cyclase. The dissociation of ACTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity from fluoride-stimulated activity in adrenal cell mutants indicates that ACTH and fluoride act on adenylate cyclase at different sites."
https://openalex.org/W1599491542,"Abstract To extend the use of affinity labeling for the characterization of macromolecular steroid binding sites, we have synthesized 16α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone and studied its reactions with various amino acids and 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Streptomyces hydrogenans. This compound alkylates cysteine, histidine, methionine, lysine, and β-mercaptoethanol under physiological conditions. Progesterone derivatives containing 16α-bromoacetoxy, 16α-chloroacetoxy, and 16α-acetoxy substituents are substrates of 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with apparent Km values of 1.45 x 10-4, 0.11 x 10-4, and 1.25 x 10-4 m, respectively. Under similar conditions progesterone and cortisone have respective values of 3.95 x 10-6 and 5.1 x 10-5 m. Of the three progesterone esters employed, only 16α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone inactivates the enzyme. It does so in a time-dependent, irreversible manner. When 16α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone is present in 100-fold molar excess, the rate of inactivation follows pseudo-first order kinetics with t½ = 3 hours. Progesterone, cortisone, NAD+, and NADH slow the rate of enzyme inactivation. Excess β-mercaptoethanol stops it but does not restore enzyme activity. Tritiated 16α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone, prepared by condensation of 16α-hydroxyprogesterone with [2-3H]bromoacetic acid in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, was used to radiolabel the enzyme-active site during inactivation. The amount of radioactivity incorporated during 30, 50, and 80% enzyme inactivation, indicated that in all cases 2 moles of steroid are bound per mole of enzyme. Amino acid analysis of the hydrolysates of 50 and 80% inactivated enzyme revealed that most of the radioactive material (70% of total counts per min) corresponded to known 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine. Further, the radioactivity in this enzyme hydrolysate cocrystallizes with authentic 1,3-dicarboxymethylhistidine. These observations are compatible with a mechanism whereby the progesterone moiety of 16α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone delivers the alkylating group to the active site of 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, where it reacts with a histidine residue at that site. They provide the first direct evidence for the presence of this amino acid at a dehydrogenase catalytic site. Furthermore, this supports the view that histidine probably participates in dehydrogenation. Finally, 16α-bromoacetoxyprogesterone is offered as a compound which may be used to characterize certain steroid binding sites of high affinity present in receptor proteins of target organs."
https://openalex.org/W1570964304,"Abstract Salicylate hydroxylase has been shown to react with certain analogues, effecting an uncoupling of oxygen reduction from hydroxylation (White-Stevens, R. H., and Kamin, H. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2358–2370; (1970) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 38, 882). The mechnism of action of this enzyme has now been examined by spectrophotometric and stopped flow techniques. Compounds which facilitate DPNH binding and oxidation perturb the absorption spectrum of the enzyme. From this perturbation, an apparent Ks commensurate with catalytic Km values for benzoate and salicylate can be obtained. With salicylate, one salicylate is bound per flavin. Anaerobic reduction with limiting DPNH yields only fully reduced and fully oxidized flavin; semiquinone is formed only with photoreduction in the presence of EDTA. The two flavins act independently. As observed in the stopped flow, formation of enzyme-substrate complex is very rapid; the presence of salicylate facilitates DPNH binding and determines the rate of enzyme reduction to E-FADH2. The catalytic Vmax for DPNH oxidation with several organic compounds appears to be reflected specifically in the rate constants for enzyme reduction. The reoxidation of reduced enzyme by O2 is independent of the nature or even the presence of aromatic compound and is strictly proportional to O2 tension over a wide [O2] range. Depending upon the aromatic molecule, either the rate of reduction of enzyme, the rate of oxidation, or a combination of both can be rate-limiting for catalysis. The hydroxylating species, designated E-FAD-H2O2, must be short lived and can either (a) stoichiometrically hydroxylate a suitable such as salicylate, (b) decompose rapidly and quantitatively to H2O2 if the is totally unsuitable (i.e. benzoate), or (c) hydroxylate with erratic formation of H2O2, for substrates which act in a manner intermediate between the substrate (salicylate) or pseudosubstrate (benzoate) modes."

https://openalex.org/W1594497161,"Abstract Several analogues of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) have been tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of cyclic AMP to cyclic AMP receptor (CRP) and to inhibit the cyclic AMP-CRP-dependent transcription of the gal operon. A number of the cyclic AMP derivatives are able to inhibit cyclic AMP binding to CRP, but of all the analogues studied only tubercidin 3',5'-monophosphate is able to replace cyclic AMP in promoting gal transcription. Those analogues which inhibit cyclic AMP binding also decrease cyclic AMP-CRP-dependent transcription. Derivatives with a modified cyclic phosphate structure are potent inhibitors of gal transcription although they do not influence cyclic AMP binding to CRP as observed in the ammonium sulfate precipitation assay. These results indicate a marked specificity for cyclic AMP in stimulating gal mRNA synthesis and also point to the probability that the purine base, the ribose moiety, and the cyclic phosphate group all are involved in binding to CRP and eliciting the correct conformational change of the protein required to mediate cyclic AMP-dependent gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1558347049,"Abstract The relative rates of tRNA, rRNA, and DNA synthesis were measured for steady state cultures of Escherichia coli B/r growing in succinate and glucose minimal media which support growth rates of 0.67 and 1.46 doublings per hour, respectively. Following a 2-fold increase in growth rate, the rate of tRNA synthesis increased approximately 2-fold relative to the rate of DNA synthesis and decreased 10 to 15% relative to the rate of rRNA synthesis. It is concluded that the synthesis of tRNA is regulated in a manner similar to the mechanism regulating rRNA synthesis. The 10 to 15% difference in the relative rates of synthesis is not the result of an increase in the relative frequency of ribosomal RNA cistrons at the higher growth rates, and therefore it seems that the mechanisms controlling rRNA and tRNA synthesis are at least partially independent."

https://openalex.org/W1657726410,"Abstract Isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli K-12 rapidly degrade adenosine to adenine and inosine to hypoxanthine, using membrane-localized nucleoside phosphorylase activity, without transporting them across the membrane. The free bases are then transported and accumulated intravesicularly as the nucleoside monophosphate. The kinetics of formation of the nucleoside monophosphates, AMP and IMP, respectively, shows the same response to temperature, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate concentration, and nucleotide inhibitors whether the free base or ribonucleoside is the substrate for uptake. The mechanism of purine nucleoside uptake in E. coli is therefore postulated to occur by two enzymatic steps involving two membrane enzymes: (a) extramembranal cleavage of nucleoside to free base and (b) group translocation of the free bases mediated by membrane phosphoribosyltransferases resulting in the intramembranal accumulation of nucleoside monophosphate. The second reaction is the means of adenine and hypoxanthine uptake and therefore the utilization of free purine base and purine nucleoside share a common pathway in this organism. The kinetics of uptake with respect to concentration of nucleoside or free base suggests that there may be interaction or association, or both, between the two enzymes themselves on the membrane surface."
https://openalex.org/W1557916203,"Abstract A magnetic resonance study of the paramagnetic contribution to the longitudinal (1/T1) and the transverse (1/T2) relaxation rates of the carbon-bound protons of citrate and trans-aconitate has been made utilizing Mn(II), Fe(II), and aconitase. The width of the methylene resonances in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of citrate (an AB pattern) increases linearly with Mn(II) concentration from 0 to 200 µm due to a paramagnetic effect on 1/T2 of these protons. Aconitase enhances the effect of Mn(II) on the 1/T1 and 1/T2 relaxation rates of the methylene protons of citrate and enhances the effect of Fe(II) on both relaxation rates of the —CH2— and —CHD—protons of pro-R monodeuterocitrate. From the Solomon-Bloembergen equation for 1/T1, the Mn(II) to proton distance in the aconitase-manganese-citrate ternary complex is 4.3 ± 0.5 A, and the Fe(II) to proton distances in the aconitase-iron-monodeuterocitrate ternary complex are 3.8 ± 0.2 A (—CH2—) and 3.1 ± 0.2 A (—CHD—). The absolute and relative values of these distances are in good agreement with crystallographic distances in the binary Mn(II)-citrate chelate complex. Hyperfine coupling of the unpaired electrons of enzyme-bound Fe(II) with the protons of citrate is detected. The data are, therefore, consistent with direct coordination of the substrate, citrate, by the metal ion on aconitase. In contrast with citrate, the NMR spectrum of the inhibitor trans-aconitate shows a nonlinear dependence of the width of the coupled methylene and methine resonances on the concentration of Mn(II) below 30 µm due to chemical exchange spin decoupling (Frankel, L. S. (1969) J. Mol. Spectrosc. 29, 273). Above 30 µm Mn(II), the resonance widths increase linearly with Mn(II) due to a simple paramagnetic effect on 1/T2. A ternary aconitase-manganese-trans-aconitate bridge complex is detected since aconitase enhances the effect of Mn(II) on the 1/T2 relaxation rate of the protons of trans-aconitate. From 1/T1, Mn(II) to proton distances in this ternary complex are 4.8 ± 0.5 A (—CH2—) and 5.3 ± 0.6 A (—CH—). As shown by NMR, both citrate and trans-aconitate compete for the metal site on aconitase at concentrations consistent with their respective dissociation constants as determined kinetically. From 1/T2, the aconitase-Fe(II)-citrate complex forms and dissociates rapidly enough to participate in enzyme catalysis. Hence the metal bridge complexes detected by NMR may be equated with the enzymatically active substrate complex and the enzymatically inactive inhibitor complex observed kinetically. Three mechanisms for the role of Fe(II) in the catalysis, consistent with the data, the forward and reverse ferrous wheel mechanisms, and the Bailar twist mechanism, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1598085990,"Abstract We have examined in greater detail the derepression of uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase synthesis in capR mutants of Escherichia coli first observed by Markovitz. (Markovitz, A. (1964) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 51, 239–246). All three enzymes of the gal operon are derepressed from 2- to 4-fold by this mutation. This derepression may be superimposed on the conventional derepression seen when the gal operon is induced with fucose or by a regulatory mutation. Measurement of the level of gal messenger ribonucleic acid indicates that the derepression caused by the capR mutation probably occurs at the level of transcription since there is a coordinate increase in gal enzyme activity and in the level of gal mRNA. The effect of the capR mutation on the gal operon appears to be independent of cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate or glucose-mediated repression. Thus the product of the capR locus behaves as if it is an additional negative control element affecting the expression of the gal operon."

The resulting digests were analyzed for the quantity of 14C in the deoxyribonucleoside and 5'- or 3'-deoxyribonucleotide fractions. With the sole exception of the dinucleotide 5-methyl-CpT, very little 5-methylcytosine is located at the 5' terminus of pyrimidine clusters in this DNA. Most DNA-5-methylcytosine occurs at the 3' end of pyrimidine clusters although substantial percentages of label can be found internally. Solitary cytosine residues (i.e. ...PupCpPu...) are also methylated in this DNA.

Noncovalent interactions between the smaller peptide of 75 amino acid residues and the larger, 158 to 170 amino acid segment provide a conformation which binds flavin and retains the structural features essential for NADH cytochrome b5 reductase activity. The maximum velocity is 65% of that of the unmodified enzyme. Procedures have been described for the isolation of the separate peptide fragments, and recombination experiments show that both peptides are necessary for refolding to form a catalytically active flavoprotein.

https://openalex.org/W1487505323,"Abstract The occurrence of a pyrophosphate:l-serine phosphotransferase in extracts of Propionibacterium shermanii is reported. A 102-fold purification, with 15% recovery, was obtained by successive use of protamine sulfate precipitation, acidification, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and on Bio-Gel P-150 columns. This purification eliminates inorganic pyrophosphatase and serine phosphatase activity present in the crude extract, but a serine-serine phosphate exchange activity remains. Evidence is presented that this exchange is catalyzed by a second enzyme. The enzyme is stable at room temperature, but rapidly loses activity above 50°. In the presence of l-serine the enzyme exhibits a somewhat higher lability to preliminary incubation at elevated temperatures. The Km for PPi is 1.0 x 10-4 m; the Km for l-serine is 1.9 x 10-3 m. The enzyme is specific for both substrates. ATP is not a substrate. Tripolyphosphate can substitute to some extent for PPi. d-Serine and l-cysteine are not phosphorylated. dl-Homoserine is phosphorylated to a slight extent, as is l-threonine. Mg++ greatly stimulates the reaction. Some stimulation is obtained with Mn++ and with Co++. The Km for Mg++ at 1 mm PPi is 1.3 x 10-4 m, very close to the Km for PPi at 1 mm Mg++.
