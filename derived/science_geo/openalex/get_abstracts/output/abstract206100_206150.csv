https://openalex.org/W2051216013,"FROM a number of recent papers it appears that the mobilization and transport of fat from fat depots to sites of its further utilization take place mostly in the form of non-esterified fatty acids1. Evidence that this is so is provided by Dole2 and Gordon3 who observed during states with an inadequate utilization of carbohydrates an elevated blood level of non-esterified fatty acid. When the utilization of carbohydrates was increased (after ingestion of glucose or after administration of insulin) the blood level of non-esterified fatty acids decreased. Experiments with adipose tissue in vitro also confirmed that under certain conditions non-esterified fatty acids can be released. The amount released depends on whether at the moment the animal was killed the energy requirements were satisfied from reserves. Gordon and Cherkes4 have demonstrated an increased release of non-esterified fatty acids from incubated epididymal fat of fasting rats, while during satiety the release was insignificant. It was also revealed that the release of non-esterified fatty acids from incubated adipose tissue of normal animals is increased by various hormones added in vitro: adrenalin4, noradrenalin, corti-cotropin5,6, while its release is arrested after the addition of insulin4. Thus, it can be assumed that the adipose tissue of diabetic animals, which must mobilize fat reserves, will also, in vitro, release more non-esterified fatty acids than the tissue of healthy animals. Our experiments confirm this assumption."

https://openalex.org/W2084093253,"Rabbit spermatozoa from the epididymis lack the antigenic material present on seminal spermatozoa, which these latter cells have in common with the seminal plasma. This observation provides further support for the indirect evidence, obtained previously, that antigenic material is taken up by the spermatozoa from the seminal plasma."

https://openalex.org/W2059348862,"ENZYMES capable of oxidizing mono- and diphenols are widely distributed in insects; some of these compounds are involved in the biosynthesis of exoskeletal substances, notably sclerotin1. While several ortho- and para-diphenols have been extracted from cuticle, relatively little is known about the corresponding synthetic enzymes. Recent work in connexion with the reaction of phenolic derivatives with proteins (‘tanning reaction’) has been reviewed by Hackman2, Mason3 and Dennell4. The present results form part of an investigation of the intermediary metabolism of phenolic substrates involved in sclerotin formation in Periplaneta."

https://openalex.org/W2076726000,Unilateral or bilateral stimulation of the region surrounding the sulcus principalis of the cortex of the monkey interferes with delayed alternation performance. It is without effect on auditory discrimination performance. Bilateral stimulation is more disrupting than unilateral stimulation. The impairment is limited in time to the period of stimulation and is fully reversible.

https://openalex.org/W2035598049,Unisexual strains of both mating types of Saccharomyces kluyveri produce exceedingly high yields of extracellular invertase. Yields generally increase with an increase in the number of sets of chromosomes possessed by the unisexuals. The bisexual forms give small amounts in comparison.
https://openalex.org/W2069639302,"Birds living on the Oak Ridge White Oak Lake bed, an area contaminated by low-level atomic wastes, revealed a striking seasonal difference in uptake of fission products. Because the omnivorous diet of passerine birds is ecologically comparable to the mixed diet of man, uptake of radionuclides by wild birds provides an assay of amounts to be expected at the trophic level of primary interest to man."

https://openalex.org/W2059167129,"The experiments reported here demonstrate the unexpected finding that, in mice, the pH of nitrogen mustard solution at the time it is injected into the animal appears to determine the toxicity of the material. At certain doses, highly acid solutions of nitrogen mustard show no toxic effects, while alkaline solutions at the same dose are invariably lethal. From further experiments on the antitumor activity of acid solutions of nitrogen mustard, it is cojpcluded that the toxic effect is separable from the antitumor effect."
https://openalex.org/W2040619028,"In a study of cerebral function by electroencephalographic techniques the following observations have been made. (i) In intact subjects, repeated stimulation with bright light causes a predictable change (alpha blocking) in the electroencephalogram, whereas repeated auditory stimulation does not. (ii) If, however, an auditory stimulus is presented repeatedly just before the visual stimulus, the sound temporarily but predictably acquires the property of the light to suppress the alpha activity. (iii) This linkage between sound and light occurs much less frequently in human subjects with known amounts of structural brain damage. (iv) A similar electrophysiological defect, implying impairment of brain function, occurs in patients showing severe anxiety during prolonged periods of difficulty in over-all adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2027435739,"IN 1955, among 76,542 chicks hatched from the cross, Brown Leghorn sire by Light Sussex dam, there appeared two males which, instead of having the expected white (silver) coloured down of the Light Sussex, were brown. One was sold before its genetic importance was realized. The other cock when adult was light brown in colour, being of a similar hue to that of Brown Leghorn pullets, with a few black feathers on the wings and a black tail. The black and bright brown colours which are found on the bodies of Brown Leghorn cocks were absent. The bird was strong and vigorous, and lived until killed in 1958."

https://openalex.org/W2047543499,"THE effect of staphylolysin on isolated organs has been hitherto studied mainly on isolated strips of rabbit or guinea pig gut1–5. The administration of the toxin causes a slow contraction, followed by unresponsiveness to the further application of toxins or drugs. It seemed to be of interest to perform experiments on the isolated uterus of the rat which does not respond to histamine."
