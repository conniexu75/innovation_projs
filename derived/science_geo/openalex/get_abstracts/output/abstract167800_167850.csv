https://openalex.org/W1998129814,"A very early step in the response of mammalian cells to DNA double-strand breaks is the phosphorylation of histone H2AX at serine 139 at the sites of DNA damage. Although the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, DNA-PK (DNA-dependent proteinkinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasiamutated), and ATR (ATM andRad3-related), have all been implicated in H2AX phosphorylation, the specific kinase involved has not yet been identified. To definitively identify the specific kinase(s) that phosphorylates H2AX in vivo, we have utilized DNA-PKcs−/− and Atm−/− cell lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We find that H2AX phosphorylation and nuclear focus formation are normal in DNA-PKcs−/− cells and severely compromised in Atm−/− cells. We also find that ATM can phosphorylate H2AX in vitro and that ectopic expression of ATM in Atm−/− fibroblasts restores H2AX phosphorylation in vivo. The minimal H2AX phosphorylation in Atm−/− fibroblasts can be abolished by low concentrations of wortmannin suggesting that DNA-PK, rather than ATR, is responsible for low levels of H2AX phosphorylation in the absence of ATM. Our results clearly establish ATM as the major kinase involved in the phosphorylation of H2AX and suggest that ATM is one of the earliest kinases to be activated in the cellular response to double-strand breaks.

DSBs are generated by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation (IR) or by endogenously generated reactive oxygen species and occur as intermediates during meiotic and V(D)J recombination (1Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). A very early step in the cellular response to DSBs is the phosphorylation of a histone H2A variant, H2AX, at the sites of DNA damage (2Modesti M. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R229-R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated (within seconds) at serine 139 when DSBs are introduced into mammalian cells (3Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar) resulting in discrete γ-H2AX (phosphorylated-H2AX) foci at the DNA damage sites (4Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). In experiments involving the use of “laser scissors” to introduce breaks into living cells, γ-H2AX foci localized specifically with the laser path through the cell nuclei clearly demonstrating that H2AX phosphorylation is specific to the sites of DNA damage (4Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). H2AX phosphorylation also appears to be a general cellular response to processes involving DSB intermediates including V(D)J recombination in lymphoid cells (6Chen H.T. Bhandoola A. Difilippantonio M.J. Zhu J. Brown M.J. Tai X. Rogakou E.P. Brotz T.M. Bonner W.M. Ried T. Nussenzweig A. Science (Wash. D. C.). 2000; 290: 1962-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and meiotic recombination in mice (7Mahadevaiah S.K. Turner J.M.A. Baudat F. Rogakou E.P. de Boer P. Blanco-Rodriguez J. Jasin M. Keeney S. Bonner W.M. Burgoyne P.S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of yeast H2A at serine 129 (homologous to serine 139 of mammalian H2AX) causes chromatin decondensation and is required for efficient DNA double-strand break repair (8Downs J.A. Lowndes N.F. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In mammals, phosphorylation of H2AX appears to play a critical role in the recruitment of repair or damage-signaling factors to the sites of DNA damage (5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 9Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As H2AX phosphorylation plays a very early and important role in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks, it is important to specifically identify the kinase(s) involved in this event. Members of the PI 3-kinase family, including DNA-PK (DNA-dependent proteinkinase), ATM (ataxia telangiectasiamutated), and ATR (ATM andRad3-related), are involved in the responses of mammalian cells to DSBs (10Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). γ-H2AX focus formation is inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and H2AX phosphorylation is reduced in the DNA-PK-deficient human cell line M059J (5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that DNA-PK and at least one other kinase, possibly ATM and/or ATR, can phosphorylate H2AX upon DNA damage (2Modesti M. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R229-R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 11van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). To unambiguously define the roles of ATM and DNA-PK in H2AX phosphorylation, we utilized cells derived from knockout mice for ATM or DNA-PKcs (the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK). We observed normal H2AX phosphorylation and γ-H2AX focus formation in irradiated fibroblasts derived from wild type or DNA-PKcs−/− mice. In contrast, H2AX phosphorylation and γ-H2AX focus formation were strikingly reduced to near background levels in fibroblasts from Atm−/− mice. Ectopic expression of ATM in Atm−/− cells restored H2AX phosphorylation. Moreover, we show that immunoprecipitated ATM can phosphorylate recombinant H2AX in vitro. These results indicate that ATM, not DNA-PK, is the major kinase responsible for modifying H2AX upon irradiation. The minimal H2AX phosphorylation in Atm−/− cells could be abolished by low concentrations of wortmannin suggesting that DNA-PK, rather than ATR, is responsible for low levels of γ-H2AX formation in the absence of ATM. Spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts, derived from wild type, DNA-PKcs−/− (12Kurimasa A. Ouyang H. Dong L.J. Wang S. Li X. Cordon-Cardo C. Chen D.J. Li G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1403-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or Atm−/− mice (13Xu Y. Ashley T. Brainerd E.E. Bronson R.T. Meyn M.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2411-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in α-minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from 13.5-day-old embryos and maintained in α-minimum Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown to about 70% confluence and irradiated with x-rays (300-kV, 12-mA, 0.5-mm Cu) at the rate of 5.5 gray/min to achieve a cumulative dose of 10 gray for all experiments unless otherwise mentioned. Cells were UV-irradiated at the rate of 0.15 J/m2/s to achieve a cumulative dose of 10 J/m2. Cells were harvested after 30 min, except in the case of time courses where they were harvested at time points ranging from 5 min to 8 h. Drug treatment of cells was carried out by the addition of the following DNA-damaging agents to the culture media for 1 h at the indicated concentrations: neocarzinostatin (0.2 μg/ml), bleomycin (50 μg/ml), etoposide (30 μg/ml), methyl methanesulfonate (50 μg/ml), and hydroxyurea (1 mm). Anti-γ-H2AX antibody was generated against a synthetic peptide consisting of the last nine amino acids of H2AX with phospho-Ser-139 as described before (3Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar). SDS extracts for Western blotting were prepared from mock-irradiated or irradiated cells as described previously (14D'Anna J.A. Valdez J.G. Habbersett R.C. Crissman H.A. Radiat. Res. 1997; 148: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for Western blotting are anti-γ-H2AX, anti-H2A (H-124; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-ATM monoclonal antibody MAT3–4G10/8 (15Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mitelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection of exponentially growing Atm−/− spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts with the ATM cDNA expression vector pMAT1 (16Zhang N. Chen P. Khanna K.K. Scott S. Gatei M. Kozlov S. Watters D. Spring K. Yen T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8021-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was carried out using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) as per the manufacturer’s protocols. Immediately after transfection, cells were induced for ATM expression with 5 μm CdCl2 for 16 h and then mock-irradiated or irradiated as described above. ATM immunoprecipitations were carried out as described (17Ziv Y. Banin S. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Shiloh Y. Chan D.W. Gately D.P. Urban S. Galloway A.M. Lees-Miller S.P. Yen T. Allalunis-Turner J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 99-108PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107spontaneously immortalized mouse fibroblasts were grown to 70% confluence, mock-irradiated or irradiated, harvested after 30 min, and lysed in fresh cold lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of anti-ATM monoclonal antibody MAT3–4G10/8 (15Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mitelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose beads for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed repeatedly with lysis buffer, once with high salt buffer, and twice with kinase buffer. The beads were then incubated in a kinase mix (20 μl of kinase buffer, 500 ng of recombinant H2AX (purified from bacteria), 2 μl of 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of γ[32P]ATP) at 30 °C for 10 min. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. Spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts were grown on chamber slides to about 70% confluence and then mock-irradiated or irradiated and incubated for 30 min. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized for 10 min in 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were incubated with anti-γ-H2AX antibody for 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratory, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence images were captured using an Olympus BH2 epifluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera and Cytovision software (Applied Imaging, Santa Clara, CA). To allow direct comparisons, all the cells were irradiated and processed simultaneously, and all the images were obtained using the same parameters (brightness, contrast, etc.). To examine H2AX phosphorylation in mouse cells, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (anti-γ-H2AX) was generated against a synthetic phosphorylated polypeptide consisting of the last nine amino acids of H2AX with phospho-Ser-139 (CKATQAS(PO4)QEY). The purified anti-γ-H2AX antibody reacted specifically with the immunizing polypeptide (phosphorylated at serine 139) but not with the unphosphorylated peptide (CKATQASQEY) (Fig. 1 a). Thus, the anti-γ-H2AX antibody is immunoreactive only with H2AX specifically phosphorylated at serine 139. Spontaneously immortalized wild type mouse fibroblasts were mock-irradiated or irradiated with x-rays and harvested after 30 min, and H2AX phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting of SDS extracts with anti-γ-H2AX antibody. We observed significant phosphorylation of histone H2AX in response to ionizing radiation (Fig. 1 b). The observed phosphorylation was specific to serine 139 as no signal was detected in irradiated samples when the immunizing polypeptide (phosphorylated at serine 139) was used as competitor in Western blotting (data not shown). Significant phosphorylation of H2AX was also observed after treatment of cells with the DSB-inducing agents neocarzinostatin, bleomycin, and etoposide. In contrast, there was no increase in γ-H2AX formation when these cells were irradiated with UV rays or treated with the DNA-alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate confirming that H2AX is phosphorylated at serine 139 specifically in response to DNA double-strand breaks. Low levels of H2AX phosphorylation were also observed in cells treated with the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. This is probably because cells treated with hydroxyurea accumulate DSBs because of replication fork collapse (18Saintigny Y. Delacote F. Vares G. Petitot F. Lambert S. Averbeck D. Lopez B.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3861-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Skog S. Heiden T. Eriksson S. Wallström B. Tribukait B. Anticancer Drugs. 1992; 3: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As the PI 3-kinases, DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR, have all been implicated in H2AX phosphorylation (2Modesti M. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R229-R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar,10Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 11van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine which of these three kinases played a major role in the process. The fungal PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibits the kinase activities of ATM and DNA-PK in intact cells with half-maximal inhibition at concentrations of about 5 μm(20Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase activity of ATR is significantly more resistant to this drug with half-maximal inhibition at concentrations higher than 100 μm. Spontaneously immortalized wild type mouse fibroblasts were treated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min, irradiated with x-rays, harvested after 30 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. We found that H2AX phosphorylation was inhibited by low concentrations of wortmannin (1–10 μm) indicating that ATM and/or DNA-PK, but not ATR, is involved in this process (Fig. 1 c). Spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts from wild type, DNA-PKcs−/−, or Atm−/− mice were mock-irradiated or irradiated, harvested at time points ranging from 5 min to 8 h, and assayed for H2AX phosphorylation by Western blotting. H2AX phosphorylation in both wild type and DNA-PKcs−/− cells occurred very rapidly (within 5 min) and lasted for about 2 h, with maximum levels of phosphorylation observed at 30 min (Fig. 2 a). In striking contrast, we observed minimal H2AX phosphorylation in irradiated Atm−/− cells. Although we observed robust H2AX phosphorylation in DNA-PKcs−/− cells at 30 min post-irradiation, γ-H2AX formation in Atm−/− cells was reproducibly reduced to about 5% of that in wild type cells (Fig. 2 b) indicating that ATM is the major kinase responsible for H2AX phosphorylation upon DNA damage. Atm−/− fibroblasts were treated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin for 30 min, irradiated with x-rays, harvested after 30 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. We found that the minimal H2AX phosphorylation in Atm−/− cells was completely abolished by low concentrations of wortmannin (1–10 μm) (Fig. 2 c). As ATR is inhibited by high concentrations of wortmannin (>100 μm) (20Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that DNA-PK, rather than ATR, is responsible for low levels of γ-H2AX formation in the absence of ATM. It is possible that other mutations in the Atm−/− cell line used could also be responsible for the lack of H2AX phosphorylation in these cells. We, therefore, examined H2AX phosphorylation in a panel of isogenic, early passage (p2 or p3) ATM+/+ or −/− MEFs. Normal H2AX phosphorylation was observed in irradiated Atm+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3 a, upper panel). In contrast, very low levels of γ-H2AX formation was observed in two independent Atm−/− MEFs confirming that ATM is required for H2AX phosphorylation in response to IR. No significant difference in H2AX phosphorylation was observed between irradiated DNA-PKcs+/− and −/− MEFs (Fig. 3 a, lower panel). To confirm that ATM is required in vivo for H2AX phosphorylation, the ATM cDNA expression vector pMAT1 (16Zhang N. Chen P. Khanna K.K. Scott S. Gatei M. Kozlov S. Watters D. Spring K. Yen T. Lavin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8021-8026Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected into Atm−/− spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts. The ectopic expression of ATM in the transfected cells resulted in restoration of H2AX phosphorylation upon irradiation (Fig. 3 b, compare lanes 2 and 4). On the other hand, cells transfected with the vector alone showed no increase in γ-H2AX formation (Fig. 3 b, compare lanes 2and 6). The correlation between ATM expression and H2AX phosphorylation establishes that ATM is required in vivo for γ-H2AX formation in response to ionizing radiation. To determine whether ATM can directly phosphorylate H2AX in vitro, ATM was immunoprecipitated from spontaneously immortalized wild type fibroblasts using an anti-ATM monoclonal antibody raised against a peptide representing positions 1967–1988 of murine ATM (15Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mitelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated ATM efficiently phosphorylated recombinant H2AX in vitro (Fig. 3 c, lane 1). Furthermore, irradiation of cells resulted in a significant increase in H2AX phosphorylation (Fig. 3 c, lane 2). Essentially no ATM protein or kinase activity was detected when immunoprecipitation was performed with normal mouse IgG or from Atm−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 3 c, lanes 3–6). The in vitro phosphorylation of H2AX by ATM suggests that ATM could directly phosphorylate H2AX within the cell in response to DNA damage. H2AX phosphorylation in response to DNA damage results in the formation of discrete γ-H2AX foci at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks (4Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar). To determine the status of γ-H2AX focus formation in wild type, DNA-PKcs−/−, and Atm−/− spontaneously immortalized fibroblasts, these cells were irradiated and allowed to recover for 30 min before fixation and immunostaining with anti-γ-H2AX antibody. We observed robust γ-H2AX focus formation upon irradiation of both wild type and DNA-PKcs−/− cells (Fig. 4). In striking contrast, focus formation was very poor in Atm−/− cells confirming that ATM is required for γ-H2AX focus formation at the sites of DSBs. Histone H2AX is rapidly phosphorylated at serine 139 in response to DNA double-strand breaks (3Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinases, DNA-PK, ATM, and ATR, have all been implicated in this process (2Modesti M. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R229-R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 11van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Although the substrate specificities of these kinases are overlapping in vitro, they have clearly distinct functions in vivo(10Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). For example, whereas ATM phosphorylates p53, Chk2, and Nbs1 leading to cell cycle arrest, DNA-PK is not required for any of these processes (21Burma S. Kurimasa A. Xie G. Taya Y. Araki R. Abe M. Crissman H.A. Ouyang H. Li G.C. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17139-17143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DNA-PK, unlike ATM, may be involved in the recruitment of XRCC4 and DNA ligase IV to the sites of DSBs (23Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to definitively delineate the roles of these kinases in the phosphorylation of H2AX. We demonstrate that ATM can phosphorylate H2AX in vitro and that H2AX phosphorylation and γ-H2AX focus formation are severely compromised in Atm−/− cells. Ectopic expression of ATM corrects this defect. In contrast, these functions are normal in DNA-PKcs−/− cells. Interestingly, DNA-PK, but not ATR, may be responsible for the minimal levels of H2AX phosphorylation in Atm−/− cells as this can be abolished by low concentrations of wortmannin. We also find that immunoprecipitated ATM can directly interact with recombinant H2AX in vitro, 2Sandeep Burma and David J. Chen, unpublished results. and experiments will be performed to examine complex formation between H2AX and ATM in vivo. Our results establish that ATM is the major kinase responsible for histone H2AX phosphorylation in response to DNA double-strand breaks in murine fibroblasts. The reduced H2AX phosphorylation reported in M059J cells (5Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) could, therefore, be because of the low levels of ATM in these cells (24Hoppe B.S. Jensen R.B. Kirchgessner C.U. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2361-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 26Chan D.W. Gately D.P. Urban S. Galloway A.M. Lees-Miller S.P. Yen T. Allalunis-Turner J. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1998; 74: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) rather than because of the absence of DNA-PK. ATM plays a crucial role in the rapid induction of multiple signaling pathways in response to DSBs, leading to repair of DNA damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and cellular stress responses (27Rotman G. Shiloh Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6135-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As γ-H2AX focus formation is a very early event occurring within seconds of DNA damage infliction (3Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4049) Google Scholar), our results indicate that ATM is one of the earliest kinases to be activated in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks. Supporting the important role of ATM in damage-induced chromatin modification is a report indicating that ATM is also required for the IR-induced transient dephosphorylation of histone H1, which is thought to contribute to chromatin decondensation (28Guo C.Y. Wang Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18715-18720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with a recent report indicating that a fraction of nuclear ATM co-localizes with γ-H2AX at the sites of DSBs in response to DNA damage (15Andegeko Y. Moyal L. Mitelman L. Tsarfaty I. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38224-38230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A very striking correlation was reported between the kinetics of appearance and dissolution of γ-H2AX foci and DNA-bound ATM aggregates. This suggests that DNA localization by ATM and H2AX phosphorylation occur concomitantly, very rapidly after DNA damage, and decrease at the same rate thereafter. In the light of this report, our findings suggest that once ATM is activated at a DSB, it could immediately phosphorylate histone H2AX at the site of the break thereby signaling to the cell that a DSB has occurred. This very early event could then initiate the recruitment of DNA repair or damage-signaling factors to the break mediated by chromatin modification and/or direct interactions of these factors with phospho-H2AX. We are grateful to Dr. William Bonner (National Institutes of Health) for the anti-γ-H2AX antibody used in preliminary studies, Dr. Yosef Shiloh (Tel Aviv University) for anti-ATM antibody, and Dr. Martin Lavin (Queensland Institute of Medical Research) for pMat1 plasmid.

https://openalex.org/W1979895839,"Recent studies demonstrated the neuronogenic role of radial glial cells (RGCs) in the rodent. To reveal the fate of radial glial processes, we intensively monitored divisions of RGCs in DiI-labeled slices from the embryonic day 14 mouse cortex. During RGC division, each pia-connected fiber becomes thin but is neither lost nor divided; it is inherited asymmetrically by one daughter cell. In divisions that produce a neuron and a progenitor, the neuron inherits the pial fiber, also grows a thick ventricular process for several hours, and is therefore indistinguishable from the progenitor RGC. The ventricular process in the radial glial-like neuron (""radial neuron"") then collapses, leading to ascent of the neuron by using the ""recycled"" radial fiber."
https://openalex.org/W2082807347,"Within the developing vertebrate nervous system, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal subtype identity with generic features of neuronal differentiation are poorly defined. We show here that a bHLH protein, Olig2, is expressed selectively by motor neuron progenitors and has a key role in specifying the subtype identity and pan-neuronal properties of developing motor neurons. The role of Olig2 in the specification of motor neuron subtype identity depends on regulatory interactions with progenitor homeodomain proteins, whereas its role in promoting pan-neuronal properties is associated with expression of another bHLH protein, Ngn2. Both aspects of Olig2 function appear to depend on its activity as a transcriptional repressor. Together, these studies show that Olig2 has a critical role in integrating diverse features of motor neuron differentiation in the developing spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2146517909,"Olig2, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is expressed in a restricted domain of the spinal cord ventricular zone that sequentially generates motoneurons and oligodendrocytes. Just prior to oligo-dendrocyte precursor formation, the domains of Olig2 and Nkx2.2 expression switch from being mutually exclusive to overlapping, and Neurogenins1 and 2 are extinguished within this region. Coexpression of Olig2 with Nkx2.2 in the spinal cord promotes ectopic and precocious oligodendrocyte differentiation. Both proteins function as transcriptional repressors in this assay. This effect is blocked by forced expression of Neurogenin1. By contrast, misexpression of Olig2 alone derepresses Neurogenins and promotes motoneuron differentiation. Olig2 therefore functions sequentially in motoneuron and oligodendrocyte fate specification. This dual action is enabled by spatio-temporal changes in the expression domains of other transcription factors with which Olig2 functionally interacts."
https://openalex.org/W2071199993,"We provide physiological, pharmacological, and structural evidence that axons of hippocampal principal cells are electrically coupled, with prepotentials or spikelets forming the physiological substrate of electrical coupling as observed in cell somata. Antidromic activation of neighboring axons induced somatic spikelet potentials in neurons of CA3, CA1, and dentate gyrus areas of rat hippocampal slices. Somatic invasion by these spikelets was dependent on the activation of fast Na(+) channels in the postjunctional neuron. Antidromically elicited spikelets were suppressed by gap junction blockers and low intracellular pH. Paired axo-somatic and somato-dendritic recordings revealed that the coupling potentials appeared in the axon before invading the soma and the dendrite. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that putative axons of principal cells were dye coupled. Our data thus suggest that hippocampal neurons are coupled by axo-axonal junctions, providing a novel mechanism for very fast electrical communication."

It remains elusive how specification of neuronal identity coordinates with acquisition of pan-neuronal properties.

Olig2 and Ngn2 are specifically coexpressed in motoneuron progenitors. Misexpression studies in chick demonstrate the specific, combinatorial actions of Olig2 and Ngn2 in motoneuron generation. Our results further revealed crossregulatory interactions between bHLH and homeodomain transcription factors in the specification of motoneurons. We suggest that distinct classes of transcription factors collaborate to generate motoneurons in the ventral neural tube."

https://openalex.org/W2167372515,"Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the role of medial temporal regions during active maintenance of information over short delays or working memory. In experiment 1, we observed sustained bilateral hippocampal activation during maintenance of novel faces across a short delay period but not during face encoding or recognition. In contrast, we observed transient right parahippocampal activation during encoding and recognition but not during maintenance. We replicated these findings in experiment 2 and further determined that anterior hippocampal activation was greater during maintenance of novel than familiar faces. Our results reveal the importance of medial temporal lobe regions for the active maintenance of novel information in the absence of perceptual stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1990264946,"Western blot analysis of neuronal tissues taken from fear-conditioned rats showed a selective activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) in the amygdala. PI-3 kinase was also activated in response to long-term potentiation (LTP)-inducing tetanic stimulation. PI-3 kinase inhibitors blocked tetanus-induced LTP as well as PI-3 kinase activation. In parallel, these inhibitors interfered with long-term fear memory while leaving short-term memory intact. Tetanus and forskolin-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was blocked by PI-3 kinase inhibitors, which also inhibited cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These results provide novel evidence of a requirement of PI-3 kinase activation in the amygdala for synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation, and this activation may occur at a point upstream of MAPK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2098409714,"SLAP-130/Fyb (SLP-76-associated phosphoprotein or Fyn-binding protein; also known as Fyb/Slap) is a hematopoietic-specific adapter, which associates with and modulates function of SH2-containing leukocyte phosphoprotein of 76 kilodaltons (SLP-76). T cells from mice lacking SLAP-130/Fyb show markedly impaired proliferation following CD3 engagement. In addition, the T cell receptor (TCR) in SLAP-130/Fyb mutant cells fails to enhance integrin-dependent adhesion. Although TCR-induced actin polymerization is normal, TCR-stimulated clustering of the integrin LFA-1 is defective in SLAP-130/Fyb-deficient cells. These data indicate that SLAP-130/Fyb is important for coupling TCR-mediated actin cytoskeletal rearrangement with activation of integrin function, and for T cells to respond fully to activating signals."

Functionally, Fyb/Slap has no apparent role in the activation of known TCR signaling pathways, F-actin polymerization, or TCR clustering. Rather, Fyb/Slap regulates TCR-induced integrin clustering and adhesion. Thus, Fyb/Slap is the first molecular adapter to be identified that couples TCR stimulation to the avidity modulation of integrins governing T cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2144274759,"Specification of neuronal fate in the vertebrate central nervous system depends on the profile of transcription factor expression by neural progenitor cells, but the precise roles of such factors in neurogenesis remain poorly characterized. Two closely related transcriptional repressors, Nkx6.2 and Nkx6.1, are expressed by progenitors in overlapping domains of the ventral spinal cord. We provide genetic evidence that differences in the level of repressor activity of these homeodomain proteins underlies the diversification of interneuron subtypes, and provides a fail-safe mechanism during motor neuron generation. A reduction in Nkx6 activity further permits V0 neurons to be generated from progenitors that lack homeodomain proteins normally required for their generation, providing direct evidence for a model in which progenitor homeodomain proteins direct specific cell fates by actively suppressing the expression of transcription factors that direct alternative fates."
https://openalex.org/W1967794631,"We have developed a presenilin-1 (PS1) conditional knockout mouse (cKO), in which PS1 inactivation is restricted to the postnatal forebrain. The PS1 cKO mouse is viable and exhibits no gross abnormalities. The carboxy-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein differentially accumulate in the cerebral cortex of cKO mice, while generation of beta-amyloid peptides is reduced. Expression of Notch downstream effector genes, Hes1, Hes5, and Dll1, is unaffected in the cKO cortex. Although basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression at hippocampal area CA1 synapses are normal, the PS1 cKO mice exhibit subtle but significant deficits in long-term spatial memory. These results demonstrate that inactivation of PS1 function in the adult cerebral cortex leads to reduced Abeta generation and subtle cognitive deficits without affecting expression of Notch downstream genes."

All of these disorders are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein PrPC, denoted PrPSc, which represents the major component of infectious scrapie prions (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5149) Google Scholar). The formation of PrPSc from PrPC is accompanied by profound changes in structure and biochemical properties. PrPC, which is rich in α-helical regions, is converted into a molecule with mainly β-sheeted structure, and PrPSc becomes partially resistant to proteolytic digestion (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl.

During biogenesis PrPCtransits through the secretory pathway and is modified by the attachment of two N-linked carbohydrate chains and a glycolipid (GPI)1 anchor connecting it with the cell surface. In addition, two different transmembrane forms have been described (5Hegde R.S. Tremblay P. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Lingappa V.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The conversion of PrPC into PrPSc is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized (6Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Prusiner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16188-16199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. Avraham D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), although the molecular mechanisms of the conversion reaction remains enigmatic. Biosynthesis of PrPC is a prerequisite for PrPSc formation, as mice lacking PrP are resistant to scrapie (9Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Studies in transgenic animals favor a model in which PrPC and PrPSc interact directly, possibly in a complex with auxiliary factors (1,10). The physiological function of the cellular prion protein is still unclear. It is mainly expressed on neurons (11Kretzschmar H.A. Prusiner S.B. Stowring L.E. DeArmond S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar) and is evolutionarily highly conserved (12,13). As PrPC can bind Cu(II) ions (14,15) and may have some superoxide dismutase activity (16Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), it could have a possible protective function against oxidative stress. Mice lacking PrPC show no obvious abnormalities in behavior and reproductivity (17,18). There are some reports of impairments of knockout mice on the neuronal level, such as altered long term potentiation and defects in GABA-ergic receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition (19,20). Other studies found no electrophysiological differences in the hippocampal region of PrP null mice compared with wild type mice (21Lledo P.M. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Nicoll R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2403-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Attempts at further insight into the putative function of PrPC were made by searching for interacting proteins using various biophysical assays. Candidate proteins found were Bcl-2 (22Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 37: 249-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Hsp60 (23Edenhofer F. Rieger R. Famulok M. Wendler W. Weiss S. Winnacker E.L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4724-4728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the 37-kDa LRP (24Rieger R. Edenhofer F. Lasmezas C.I. Weiss S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Recently, PrPC has been suggested to play a role in signal transduction, as cross-linking leads to activation of the tyrosine kinase Fyn, which is involved in intracellular signaling (25Mouillet-Richard S. Ermonval M. Chebassier C. Laplanche J.L. Lehmann S. Launay J.M. Kellermann O. Science. 2000; 289: 1925-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). As neurons have a high PrP expression, the highest probability of finding interactors of the prion protein should be given by screening proteins expressed in the brain. Therefore, we used a cDNA library derived from brain of adult BALB/c mice to perform a yeast two-hybrid assay with murine PrP. We identified synapsin Ib, Grb2, and a yet unknown protein with high homology to several EST sequences, to be referred to as Pint1 (forprion interactor 1). Interaction with PrP was confirmed in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Fractionation assays indicated a common subcellular compartment, where all of the proteins can be present. As synapsin Ib and Grb2 are both involved in neuronal signaling pathways, our findings strongly indicate that the function of PrPC is connected with signal transduction processes. All plasmids used for the screening of the cDNA library were included in the Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system (Matchmaker2 kit, CLONTECH). The ORF of murine PrP-A encoding aa 23–231 (without signal peptides) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic mouse DNA (derived from N2a cells) using appropriate primers providing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites and ligated in frame into the bait vector pAS2-1. An analogous procedure was used to generate N- and C-terminal fragments of PrP ranging from aa 23–100 or 90–231, respectively. The mouse brain cDNA library was derived from BALB/c mice (CLONTECH). Inserts were cloned into pACT2 viaEcoRI and XhoI sites. For the vaccinia virus expression system (see below), inserts were subcloned from the original plasmids via EcoRI and XhoI sites into the bait plasmid pGBKT7, which encodes an N-terminal c-Myc-derived epitope tag (Myc) and into the prey plasmid pGADT7, encoding an N-terminal hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA). Both contain a T7 promoter (in contrast to pAS2-1 and pACT2) between the Gal4 transcriptional activation/Gal4 DNA binding domains and the HA/Myc epitopes. The use of the T7 promoter leads to the expression of N-terminally tagged inserts without the mentioned Gal4 domains. For performing the yeast two-hybrid screen, we used a Gal4-based system (Matchmaker2,CLONTECH). The mouse brain cDNA library was purchased from CLONTECH and amplified.Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains Y190 and Y187 have been described (26Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5238) Google Scholar). Y190 cells were transformed with the bait plasmid followed by large scale transformation of the library, plated on selective media lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ura, and incubated for 5–10 days. Plates were analyzed by a β-galactosidase colony filter lift assay. Blue colonies were restreaked, and positive staining was confirmed by repeating the assay. After isolation of the pACT2 plasmids encoding the library clones, these plasmids were tested for autoactivation of the reporter gene in yeast by co-transforming them with either the empty bait plasmid pAS2-1 or the same plasmid encoding an unrelated negative control (lamin c). Activation of the reporter genes was further confirmed in the yeast strain Y187. Isolates resulting in blue staining without the presence of the PrP bait were excluded from further investigation. All other plasmids were sequenced, and a search for data base homologies was performed using the BLAST algorithm (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59892) Google Scholar). Screening of parts of the library was performed twice independently. Murine neuroblastoma cell line N2a (ATCC CCL 131) and their persistently scrapie-infected and PrP-overproducing counterpart ScN2a have been described (28Butler D.A. Scott M.R. Bockman J.M. Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A. Hsiao K.K. Kingsbury D.T. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat insulinoma cells Rin2a were from ATCC. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplied with 10% fetal calf serum, glutamate, and antibiotics. Postnuclear supernatants were produced by rinsing the cells with PBS, followed by the addition of cold lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate) for 5 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. Supernatants were supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, and aprotinin; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and precipitated in 80% methanol at −20 °C. The resulting pellet was solubilized in 200 μl of TNE (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA), and the protein content was measured by a BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard before adding 100 μl of SDS loading buffer (7% SDS, 30% glycerine, 20% Mercapto-ethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue in 90 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed by transferring the proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and detection was performed as described below. BHK cells were grown in BHK-21 medium (Glasgow medium, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. At 75% confluence cells were infected with the vaccinia virus strain vT7-3 encoding recombinant T7 polymerase (29Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1874) Google Scholar) at an multiplicity of infection of 3–5 for 45 min immediately prior to DNA transfection. The infection results in the production of the desired proteins in high amounts, as they are transcribed under the control of the T7 promoter independently of the cellular RNA polymerases. This makes radioactive labeling dispensable and reduces the unspecific binding of cellular proteins. Five μg of DNA from both bait and prey plasmids were used for co-transfection of the cells using a calcium phosphate-based method (Stratagene). Cells were incubated for an additional 24–48 h until harvesting. Transformation efficiency was controlled with a green fluorescent protein plasmid under control of a T7 promoter. BHK cells co-expressing Myc-tagged PrP and a HA-tagged interactor detected by the yeast two-hybrid screening were rinsed twice with PBS and lysed for 5 min on ice with lysis buffer B (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cellular debris was pelleted and the supernatants were precleared with 50 μl of pre-equilibrated Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. The precleared lysates were then incubated with 1 μg of HA antibodies (Santa Cruz) for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for 1 h. Beads were washed five times with cold lysis buffer, and the precipitated proteins were eluted by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min in 50 μl of sample buffer and used in SDS-PAGE. The complete ORF of Grb2 was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from murine RNA using appropriate primers and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Full-length murine PrP ranging from aa 1 to 254 was also subcloned into this vector. Point mutations generating the 3f4 epitope and the 3AV mutation were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The 3AV construct has three alanine to valine substitutions and has been described to increase the transmembrane forms of PrP (30Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). BHK cells were infected and transfected as described above. Cell lysates were subjected to co-precipitation in buffer B using a polyclonal Grb2 antibody (kindly provided by A. Ullrich). Detection of precipitated PrP/Grb2 complexes was done by immunoblotting with PrP mAb 3f4 (Signet Laboratories) and Grb2 mAb 3f2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a gel containing 10% acrylamide and were blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry method. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Monoclonal anti-c-Myc and anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used at a dilution of 1:1000 in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Antibodies against synapsin I (mAb A10C; Biozym) and Grb2 (Stressgen) were used at a dilution of 1:2000 and 1:2500, respectively. β-Actin antibodies (Sigma) were used 1:5000, the monoclonal PrP antibody 4F2 at 1:1000, and 3f4 at 1:5000. Detection was performed using peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies and the ECL plus kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Confluent N2a and Rin2a cells were scraped off the culture plates in 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA. Cells were disrupted on ice with a Dounce homogenizer, and the efficacy was tested by trypan blue staining. Sucrose was increased to 1.2 m and overlaid with three buffers containing 1.1, 1.0, and 0.5 msucrose. This gradient was centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 ×g, resulting in opaque bands at 0.8 m (Golgi fraction) and 1.15 m (ER fraction) sucrose. The purity of the fractions was tested by Western blotting with antibodies against Rab6 (Santa Cruz) and calnexin (Stressgen). A RNA dot blot (CLONTECH) containing mRNA from different mouse organs was used to identify tissue-specific expression of Pint1. DNA probes were prepared by labeling the plasmids containing the clones of interest with radioactive [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the Megaprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization and washing was performed with Express-Hyb solution (CLONTECH). Signals were detected by phosphorimaging. An analogous approach was used on a classical mRNA blot (Ambion) representing different murine tissue to determine the size of the mRNA. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins physically interacting with the cellular prion protein. By using a homologous combination of bait and prey proteins both derived from mouse, we improved the probability of detecting putative neuronal interactors of PrPC. The mature sequence of murine PrPC (residues 23–231; Fig.1 B) fused in frame to the Gal4-binding domain was used as bait to screen a cDNA library generated from murine brain fused to the Gal4-transactivation domain. The screening of the library revealed several yeast clones resulting in positive signals in the β-galactosidase assay. Sequencing of the isolated plasmids and search for homologous sequences in data bases were performed. Most of the isolates were homologous to proteins described to give typically false positive results in a yeast two-hybrid assay, such as mitochondrial proteins or proteins of the citric acid cycle (31Luban J. Goff S.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and were therefore excluded from further investigations. However, some clones not belonging to the above groups showed an extremely high homology to known proteins and/or published gene sequences and were chosen for further biochemical characterization. One was coding for the murine growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) (32Suen K.L. Bustelo X.R. Pawson T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5500-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Grb2 contains a central SH2 domain flanked by an N- and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Fig.2 A). Structurally our isolate includes about half of the central SH2 and the C-terminal SH3 domain from aa 85 to aa 217. The second clone represents the D/F region of murine synapsin Ib ranging from residue 460 to the stop codon at aa 670 (Fig. 2 B). The third isolate was coding for an ORF encoding a protein of 162 aa residues (Fig.3 A). Significant parts of its sequence are identical to several EST clones (Fig. 3 B). A stretch of 90 aa has an almost complete homology to one derived from human brain and one from human heart (GenBank™ accession nos.AAC19158 and AAH01072). The same part of the sequence additionally has a striking similarity to several other hypothetical proteins of humans and Caenorhabditis elegans. Of note, no similarity was found for the C-terminal part of the isolated protein. As this protein was not yet described in data bases, we designated it Pint1 (for prion interactor 1, GenBank™ accession number AY029599).Figure 3Amino acid sequence of the prion interactor Pint1 and alignments.

To confirm the interaction of the identified proteins with PrP by a method completely unrelated to the yeast interaction trap, we used a vaccinia virus-based expression system in mammalian cells. A vaccinia strain encoding the T7 polymerase was used to infect BHK cells harboring plasmids containing both PrP and the putative interactors under the control of a T7 promoter. The infection led to high expression of the desired proteins in the cytoplasm, fused to either an N-terminal c-Myc (bait) or HA epitope (c-DNA isolates). They were not fused to the Gal4 transcriptional activator or DNA binding domains that were present in yeast. Lysates of the cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation, and the co-precipitated bait protein (PrP) was detected by immunoblot. The full-length construct PrP-(23–231) was used to test whether the interaction of synapsin Ib, Grb2 and Pint1 could be reproduced in mammalian cells. A band indicating the co-precipitation of PrP-23–231 is visible with all three isolates (Fig.4 A, lanes 2,4, and 6). No signal is detectable in cells co-expressing the yeast-isolates with the unrelated negative control (Myc-tagged rabies virus M protein; lanes 1, 3, and 5) and in cells expressing only Myc-tagged PrP-(23–231) or mock-infected cells (lane 7 and 8). Neither the bait nor the prey proteins showed an intrinsic affinity to Protein A-Sepharose or to the Myc epitope per se. Additionally, when lysates of cells that separately expressed PrP and the interactors were mixed after lysis, no signals indicating a co-precipitation of PrP were detectable (data not shown). Our data show that PrP-(23–231) can specifically interact with synapsin Ib, Grb2, and Pint1, not only in yeast but also in mammalian cells. After the initial screening of the library with full-length PrP-(23–231), the identified clones were subjected to binding assays with truncated constructs of PrP to determine the region of interaction. Two constructs encoding the N-terminal (aa 23–100) or the C-terminal part of PrP (aa 90–231) were used to test their ability to interact with the identified clones in BHK cells by co-immunoprecipitation. PrP-(23–100) includes the putative copper-binding octarepeats and, having no defined NMR structure, is thought to be highly flexible, whereas PrP-(90–231) contains the ordered, mainly α-helical structure (33Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Consequently, we tested our isolates for interaction with these two parts of the protein. For confirmation, PrP-(23–231) was again used for co-immunoprecipitation and a specific band was detectable in the precipitate of all three proteins (Fig.5, lanes 1–3). Similarly, C-terminal PrP-(90–231) gave rise to a specific band visible with all three interactors (Fig. 5, lanes 4–6). A specific signal was obtained with N-terminal PrP-(23–100) with synapsin I and Grb2 (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 9), but no interaction with Pint1 was detectable (lane 8). In summary, we have shown that synapsin Ib and Grb2 can physically interact with both PrP-(23–100) and PrP-(90–231), whereas the binding motif to Pint1 is encoded in PrP-(90–231). These findings indicate that PrP-(23–231) has at least two distinct sites enabling it to interact with synapsin Ib and Grb2. SH3 domains are known to interact with proline-rich proteins bearing the consensus motifXPXXP. Such a site is present in wild type PrP at position 101–105, but absent in two mutations leading to Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) in humans (P102L and P105L, respectively) (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5149) Google Scholar). We showed above that Grb2 is able to bind both to PrP-(23–100) and to PrP-(90–231). To avoid binding to the putative N-terminal binding site, we introduced the GSS mutations only in C-terminal PrP-(90–231) and tested the influence on Grb2 binding by co-precipitation (Fig. 4 B). As seen in lanes 9–11, neither of the two mutations inhibited binding under these experimental conditions. Consequently, interaction of Grb2 with the C terminus of wild type and mutated PrP seems to be independent of the presence of a classicalXPXXP motif. Next, we tested whether the mature and authentic forms of Grb2 and PrP also interact. Therefore, BHK cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either full-length Grb2 or PrPC including the N- and C-terminal signal sequences or both constructs were transfected simultaneously. Cells were lysed, and a co-immunoprecipitation was performed using polyclonal Grb2 antibodies (Fig. 6). By immunoblotting, no PrPC was detectable in precipitates of cells expressing only one protein (lanes 1 and 2) or in the mixed lysates of those cells (lane 5). This indicates that the observed interaction was present before lysis and is not just an artifact occurring during cell lysis. A strong PrP signal was visible in cells co-expressing Grb2 with wild type PrPC and PrP containing the transmembrane-favoring mutations 3AV (described in Ref.30Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar (lanes 3 and 4). Additionally, two HA-tagged PrP variants (HA inserted at positions 23 and 92, respectively;lanes 6 and 7) co-precipitated with Grb2. Of note, the inserted tags resulted in slightly slower migration of PrPC in those lanes. Our data indicate that not only PrP-(23–231), but also mature and authentic PrPC, can specifically interact with full-length Grb2 in living mammalian cells. To determine the subcellular compartment where a possible interaction of the detected interactors with PrPCcould occur, we prepared microsomes from N2a cells and Rin2a cells (Fig. 7). These cell lines were chosen because they showed high expression of synapsin. First, the integrity of ER and Golgi fractions was tested by staining with the markers Rab6 and calnexin. Duplicate fractions representing either Golgi or ER vesicles were then analyzed for the presence of PrP, Grb2, and synapsin I. PrPC was found in Golgi fractions of N2a cells. No detectable PrP signal was present in the ER fractions. Grb2 was detectable solely in Golgi fractions of both Rin2a and N2a cells with no visible staining in ER. Strong signals for synapsin I were present in Golgi microsomes and weaker signals in ER fractions. This assay indicates that the proteins do fractionate at identical subcellular compartments, presumably Golgi vesicles. We conclude that the interaction of the proteins could not only occur on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, but also at intracellular vesicles. To identify the organs where Pint1 is expressed, we examined an mRNA dot blot representing different murine tissues by probing it with a Pint1 DNA fragment. A strong expression was detectable in brain as well as in heart, thyroid, and testis (Fig.8). A faint signal was visible in muscle cells, liver, pancreas, and kidney. No transcripts were detectable in embryonic development stages and in ovary, uterus, eye, lung, and spleen. The hybridization of a classical Northern blot bearing mRNA of different murine tissue revealed that the length of the corresponding mRNA has a uniform size of about 3.8 kilobases in all tissues with a positive signal (data not shown). The tissue distribution of PrP mRNA has been published previously. A high expression was reported in brain, lung, kidney, and heart, and a weaker expression was seen in liver, spleen, and other organs (34Yehiely F. Bamborough P. Da Costa M. Perry B.J. Thinakaran G. Cohen F.E. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 3: 339-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Pint1 is not only expressed in neuronal tissue, but also in a variety of other organs. The pattern is partially overlapping with the known mRNA tissue distribution of PrPC, indicating a coexpression in these organs. As we were able to show that synapsin Ib and PrPC can physically interact, we looked for cells with high endogenous levels of synapsin I. Different cell types were screened for the presence of synapsin I by immunoblot analysis. As expected, expression was detectable in cells of neuronal origin (e.g.neuroblastoma and hypothalamic cells) as well as in cells with neuroendocrine function, like insulinoma cells or β-cells of the pancreas, whereas cells derived from other tissues, like fibroblasts, lacked detectable synapsin I (data not shown). These findings are in line with the known distribution of synaptic-like vesicles in secretory cells (35Matsumoto K. Ebihara K. Yamamoto H. Tabuchi H. Fukunaga K. Yasunami M. Ohkubo H. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By comparing normal and persistently prion-infected N2a cells, we investigated whether expression of synapsin I and PrPC are correlated to prion production. Our initial studies indicated a high level of synapsin I in persistently prion-infected ScN2a cells and a weaker expression in uninfected N2a cells (data not shown). However, a closer analysis showed that the increased expression of synapsin I was not strictly dependent on the presence of PrPSc, but rose with the density of cultured cells (Fig.9 A"

We show here that the excitability of terminal apical dendrites differs from that of the apical trunk. In response to fluorescence-guided focal photolysis of caged glutamate, individual terminal apical dendrites generated cadmium-sensitive all-or-none responses that were subthreshold for somatic action potentials. Calcium transients produced by all-or-none responses were not restricted to the sites of photolysis, but occurred throughout individual distal dendritic compartments, indicating that electrogenesis is mediated primarily by voltage-gated calcium channels. Compartmentalized and binary behavior of parallel-connected terminal dendrites can greatly expand the computational power of a single neuron."
https://openalex.org/W1995477021,"Members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H protein family, H, H′, F, and 2H9, are involved in pre-mRNA processing. We analyzed the assembly of these proteins from splicing extracts onto four RNA regulatory elements as follows: a high affinity hnRNP A1-binding site (WA1), a sequence involved in Rev-dependent export (p17gag INS), an exonic splicing silencer from the β-tropomyosin gene, and an intronic splicing regulator (downstream control sequence (DCS) from the c-<i>src</i> gene. The entire family binds the WA1, instability (INS), and β-tropomyosin substrates, and the core-binding site for each is a run of three G residues followed by an A. Transfer of small regions containing this sequence to a substrate lacking hnRNP H binding activity is sufficient to promote binding of all family members. The c-<i>src</i> DCS has been shown to assemble hnRNP H, not hnRNP F, from HeLa cell extracts, and we show that hnRNP 2H9 does not bind this element. The DCS contains five G residues followed by a C. Mutation of the C to an A changes the specificity of the DCS from a substrate that binds only hnRNP H/H′ to a binding site for all hnRNP H family members. We conclude that the sequence GGGA is recognized by all hnRNP H family proteins."

IκB-dependent modulation of NF-κB subcellular localization represents one of the more poorly understood processes in the NF-κB signaling pathway. In this study, we have combined in vitro biochemical and cell-based methods to elucidate differences in NF-κB regulation exhibited by the inhibitors IκBβ and IκBα. We show that although both IκBα and IκBβ bind to NF-κB with similar global architecture and stability, significant differences exist that contribute to their unique functional roles. IκBβ derives its high affinity toward NF-κB dimers by binding to both NF-κB subunit nuclear localization signals. In contrast, IκBα contacts only one NF-κB NLS and employs its carboxyl-terminal proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich region for high affinity NF-κB binding. We show that the presence of one free NLS in the NF-κB·IκBα complex renders it a dynamic nucleocytoplasmic complex, whereas NF-κB·IκBβ complexes are localized to the cytoplasm of resting cells.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

The multiple cellular activities of NF-κB are controlled through interactions with members of the IκB family inhibitor proteins. In resting cells, NF-κB dimers reside in the cytoplasm in complex with IκB proteins, which function by masking the nuclear localization signals (NLSs)1 of NF-κB. Upon cellular stimulation, the NF-κB-associated IκB proteins are specifically phosphorylated at two amino-terminal serines by the IκB kinase complex (IKK) (4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). This leads to the removal of IκB by a ubiquitin-linked proteasome degradation pathway and to the migration of active NF-κB into the nucleus. Five homologous polypeptides, p50, p65, c-Rel, RelB, and p52, comprise the mammalian Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family. The subunits associate in a combinatorial fashion to form transcriptionally active homo- and heterodimers. The most prevalent and well characterized species of NF-κB dimer is the p50/p65 heterodimer (Fig.1 a). Rel/NF-κB polypeptides are defined by the presence of the Rel homology region (RHR), a 300-amino acid segment responsible for site-specific DNA binding, subunit dimerization, nuclear translocation, and inhibitor binding (5Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The regions responsible for the transcriptional activation lie outside of the RHR (6Chen F.E. Ghosh G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6845-6852Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). IκB is a diverse family of transcription factor inhibitors that includes IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε (7Simeonidis S. Liang S. Chen G. Thanos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14372-14377Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 9Li Z. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6184-6190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IκBγ, Bcl-3, p105, and p100 (10Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Each of the IκB family proteins contains six or seven imperfect copies of the 33-amino acid structural motif known as ankyrin repeats. Ankyrin repeat-containing domains, present in numerous proteins of diverse functions, are primarily protein-protein interaction modules (11Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Principal among IκB family proteins are the inhibitors IκBα and IκBβ (Fig.1 b). Both proteins possess an amino-terminal signal response domain, which contains a pair of conserved serine residues for inducible phosphorylation. IκBα and IκBβ also bear carboxyl-terminal segments rich in the amino acids proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST). This highly acidic PEST region represents a site for constitutive phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase II) (12Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14McElhinny J.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκBα and IκBβ both bind preferentially to p65- and c-Rel-containing NF-κB homo- and heterodimers (3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 16Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Despite extensive primary structural similarities, IκBα and IκBβ exhibit significant functional differences in vivo. The most striking of these differences is that IκBβ activates NF-κB persistently in a cell type- and stimulus-specific manner, whereas regulation of NF-κB by IκBα is rapid but transient (16Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 17Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell.

The distinct functional roles arise due in part to the fact that active NF-κB up-regulates expression of IκBα but not IκBβ. Newly synthesized IκBα can enter the nucleus and dissociate transcriptionally competent NF-κB·DNA complexes (19Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J.

IκBβ has been shown to be a weaker inhibitor of NF-κB DNA binding as compared with IκBα (18Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not precisely clear how an inhibitor that exhibits such weak binding affinity is capable of properly regulating NF-κB activity. Finally, several recent studies have shown that both free IκBα and NF-κB·IκBα complexes shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (23Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Little is known about the subcellular localization status of free IκBβ and NF-κB·IκBβ complexes. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism of NF-κB inhibition by IκBβ and compared it with IκBα. We report that, as with IκBα, IκBβ binds NF-κB dimers with 1:1 stoichiometry. However, the mechanisms by which the two inhibitors interact with NF-κB dimers differ significantly. IκBα and IκBβ vary with regard to their NF-κB DNA-inhibitory binding properties as well as in their abilities to mask the NF-κB nuclear localization sequences. IκBβ gains significant binding energy by contacting both of the NLSs of a NF-κB dimer as opposed to IκBα, which contacts only one NF-κB NLS. We report that NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer·IκBα complexes shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm by virtue of a free p50 NLS. Inactive NF-κB·IκBβ complexes, on the other hand, reside permanently in the cell cytoplasm as both the NLSs of the NF-κB dimer are masked. The cloning, expression, and purification of the NF-κB subunits and amino-terminal deletion mutants has been described previously (27Chen F. Kempiak S. Huang D. Phelps C. Ghosh G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Five serine amino acids within the carboxyl-terminal PEST region of IκBβ (residues 312, 313, 314, 316, and 318) were replaced by glutamic acids to create the E5-IκBβ protein. IκBα-(67–302), IκBβ-(54–309), IκBβ-(54–331), and E5-IκBβ-(54–331) proteins were purified by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography according to published protocols (29Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32800-32806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Full-length GST-IκBβ (residues 1–359) was purified by glutathione-agarose column chromatography following the procedures prescribed by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10% native polyacrylamide gels were prepared with 0.25× Tris-borate EDTA (TBE) buffer. Proteins and protein complexes were diluted in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 4% glycerol, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 1 h. Native gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1.25 mm β-mercaptoethanol) was then added to each sample. The gels were run in 0.25× TBE for 1.5 h at 3-mA constant current. Fluorescence polarization competition assays were performed as described previously (30Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, varying concentrations of IκBβ were mixed with constant amounts of NF-κB pre-equilibrated with fluorescein-labeled DNA. A decrease in polarization was observed with increased IκBβ concentrations. The competition assay binding curves were analyzed for IC50 values, defined as the concentration of IκBβ at 0.5 fractional occupancy. KI values, the dissociation constant for the NF-κB/IκBβ interaction, were calculated as an average of three experiments. There was less than a 20% error between individual experiments. A 6% polyacrylamide gel was prepared in 0.25× TBE, and IκBα was 32P-radiolabeled according to published methods (31Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled IκBα (18 nm) in complex with NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer (35 nm) was incubated with 10–450 nm unlabeled IκBα and IκBβ and electrophoresed at 120-mA constant current. Gels were analyzed by autoradiography. Similarly, radiolabeled IκBα (100 nm) in complex with NF-κB p65 homodimer (100 nm) was incubated with 10–450 nm IκBα and IκBβ and electrophoretically separated and analyzed. NF-κB p65-(191–321)·E5-IκBβ complex at 50 mg/ml was diluted with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 8 mg/ml. Thermolysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a zinc metalloproteinase with specificity toward isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and valine, was activated with 2 mmCaCl2, 0.145 mm ZnSO4, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0). 0.1 μg of thermolysin was added to a 50-μl reaction containing 1.5 mg/ml p65-(191–321)·E5-IκBβ complex or p65-(191–321) alone in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm CaCl2, 0.145 mmZnSO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 mm EDTA and 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading dye (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) followed by 1 min of boiling and immediate storage at −20 °C. Samples were analyzed on an 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie staining. Using a similar experimental design, NF-κB p65-(191–321)·IκBa-(67–302) complexes were treated with thermolysin, and their proteolysis patterns were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. cDNAs encoding full-length human p65, p50, and p50ΔNLS (residues 1–352) were cloned into a pcDNA vector (Invitrogen) containing either an amino-terminal FLAG (p50) or HA tag (p65). 293, HeLa, p65 wild type, and p65−/− mouse endothelial fibroblast (MEF) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown on eight-well chamber slides (Lab Tek). Cells were transfected with a total of 0.2 μg of plasmid DNA by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 1 min and blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were incubated with rabbit antibody alone or in a mixture as required for the experiment in PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and covered with a drop of mounting solution (Vector). One molecule of IκBα binds to one NF-κB dimer (32Ernst M.K. Dunn L.L. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to determine the stoichiometry of the complex between NF-κB and IκBβ. Size exclusion chromatography on NF-κB·IκBβ and NF-κB·IκBα complexes revealed that they share similar molecular masses (data not shown). This suggests that IκBβ also binds NF-κB dimers with 1:1 stoichiometry. To test this hypothesis, we performed native polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of NF-κB·IκBβ complexes (Fig. 2). Two different murine IκBβ proteins, IκBβ-(54–331) and GST-IκBβ (residues 1–359), were incubated with the RHR of NF-κB p65 (residues 19–325). The two IκBβ molecules bind NF-κB dimers with identical affinities (see below) but display unique electrophoretic mobilities in complex with p65-(19–325). When equimolar amounts of IκBβ-(54–331), GST-IκBβ, and p65-(19–325) homodimer were mixed and allowed to equilibrate, they ran as two discrete bands on the native polyacrylamide gel, the first representing the IκBβ-(54–331)·p65-(19–325) homodimer complex and the second corresponding to the GST-IκBβ·p65-(19–325) homodimer complex. Higher order binding of IκBβ to NF-κB would have resulted in the appearance of additional, intermediate mobility bands corresponding to combinations of both IκBβ molecules and p65. The absence of any such species confirms that IκBβ binds to NF-κB dimers with 1:1 stoichiometry. We determined the efficiency by which IκBβ functions as an inhibitor of NF-κB dimer DNA binding. A solution-based competition assay was performed in which fixed amounts of fluorescein-labeled κB DNA bound to the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer or p65 homodimer were incubated with increasing concentrations of IκBβ. In this assay, the IκB-dependent removal of NF-κB from DNA and the associated decrease in fluorescence polarization is monitored to determine the DNA binding inhibition constant at equilibrium (30Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). First, experiments were performed to confirm that, like IκBα, the amino-terminal signal response domain of IκBβ does not contribute to NF-κB binding affinity (data not shown). IκBβ-(54–331) inhibits the wild type DNA binding of p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325) heterodimer with an apparent inhibition constant (KI ) of 150 nm (Fig.3 a and TableI). This value is ∼10-fold weaker than that exhibited by IκBα. We next mutated all five serines within the PEST sequence of IκBβ to phosphomimetic glutamic acids (E5-IκBβ) (33McKinsey T.A. Chu Z.L. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22377-22380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This resulted in only a slight enhancement ofKI for E5-IκBβ-(54–331). Using the same fluorescence polarization competition assay, we determined the inhibition constants of these IκBβ proteins for the NF-κB p65 homodimer in complex with κB DNA (see Fig. 3 b). IκBβ-(54–331) exhibited a 2.5-fold lower affinity for p65-(19–325) homodimer as compared with the p50/p65 heterodimer (TableI). E5-IκBβ-(54–331) disrupts the p65 homodimer·DNA complex only marginally better.Table IRelative inhibition constant (Ki ) values of IκBβ for NF-κB dimer·DNA complexes as calculated from fluorescence polarization competition experimentsIκBβNF-κBKI 1-aKI = [IκBβ][NF-κB]/[IκBβ·NF-κB].RelativeKInmIκBβ-(54–331)p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325)150 ± 291E5-IκBβ-(54–331)p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325)144 ± 141IκBβ-(54–309)p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325)1533 ± 23010IκBβ-(54–331)p65-(19–325)/p65-(19–325)414 ± 1492.8E5-IκBβ-(54–331)p65-(19–325)/p65-(19–325)378 ± 922.5IκBβ-(54–309)p65-(19–325)/p65-(19–325)6700 ± 48045The KI values were determined using equations derived previously (30Malek S.

X-ray crystal structures of the NF-κB·IκBα complex reveal how the segment encompassing the NLS of the NF-κB p65 subunit (murine residues 291–319) is important for the stability of this complex (34Jacobs M.D. Harrison S.C.

Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Specifically, IκBα mediates numerous ionic interactions with the NF-κB p65 subunit NLS residues and makes van der Waals contacts with several hydrophobic side chains carboxyl-terminal to it. This region of the NF-κB RHR does not exhibit an ordered structure in the DNA-bound NF-κB crystal structures (36Müller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 37Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 38Huang D.B.

To determine whether the p65 NLS polypeptide is as important for IκBβ binding, we generated a shorter version of the p65 subunit RHR that ends at residue Arg304. Fluorescence polarization competition assays were performed to determine the binding affinity of IκBβ for both the wild type p65-(19–325) RHR homodimer and the truncated p65-(19–304) (Fig. 3 b). As seen in Table II and Fig.3 b, the binding affinity of IκBβ for p65-(19–325) is 24-fold tighter than for p65-(19–304). In contrast, IκBα binds to the corresponding p65 homodimers with similar affinities. In a separate study, in which direct binding of recombinant NF-κB and IκB proteins was assayed, we observed that IκBα binds to p65-(19–325) homodimer with 5–6-fold higher affinity than p65-(19–304) (31Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We currently have no explanation for the discrepancy in the values obtained from the two methods. Regardless, both assays indicate that this NLS polypeptide segment of NF-κB plays a lesser role in binding to IκBα as compared with IκBβ.Table IIRelative contribution of the carboxyl-terminal segments of the NF-κB Rel homology region toward IκB bindingIκBNF-κBKIRelativeKInmIκBα-(67–317)p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325)15 ± 51IκBα-(67–317)p50-(39–363)/p65-(19–304)8 ± 30.5IκBα-(67–317)p65-(19–325)/p65-(19–325)140 ± 151IκBα-(67–317)p65-(19–304)/p65-(19–304)145 ± 111IκBβ-(54–331)p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325)150 ± 291IκBβ-(54–331)p50-(39–363)/p65-(19–304)1470 ± 27010IκBβ-(54–331)p65-(19–325)/p65-(19–325)414 ± 1491IκBβ-(54–331)p65-(19–304)/p65-(19–304)10000 ± 212024As in Table I, binding values are determined by the ability of IκB protein to inhibit NF-κB/DNA complexes in vitro.aKI = [IκBβ][NF-κB]/[IκBβ·NF-κB]. Open table in a new tab As in Table I, binding values are determined by the ability of IκB protein to inhibit NF-κB/DNA complexes in vitro. aKI = [IκBβ][NF-κB]/[IκBβ·NF-κB]. We also determined the binding affinities of IκBβ-(54–331) for both the wild type NF-κB p50-(39–376)/p65-(19–325) heterodimer and the truncated heterodimer p50-(39–363)/p65-(19–304). As summarized in Table II, the binding affinity of the truncated heterodimer is nearly 10-fold weaker as compared with the wild type p50/p65 heterodimer. In contrast, IκBα binds both the long and short NF-κB heterodimers with nearly equal affinities (Table II). Again, analysis of IκBα·NF-κB complex formation by direct binding assay showed a 4-fold higher affinity for the longer p50/p65 heterodimer as compared with p50-(39–363)/p65-(19–304) (31Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In all, these experiments indicate that the NLS polypeptide segment of NF-κB p65 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers makes greater contributions to overall binding affinity in the case of IκBβ but not IκBα. In addition to fluorescence polarization experiments, the stability of these complexes was analyzed by qualitative analytical size exclusion chromatography. A 5-fold molar excess of IκBβ was incubated with either the truncated p65-(19–304) or p65-(19–325) homodimer, and the complexes were separated on a size exclusion column (data not shown). The NF-κB p65-(19–304)·IκBβ complex exhibits one broad peak, suggestive of an unstable complex. The p65-(19–325) homodimer·IκBβ complex, on the other hand, displays one sharp peak corresponding to the NF-κB·IκBβ complex followed by a second peak that contains free IκBβ. These experiments lend support to the hypothesis that the NLS polypeptides of NF-κB subunits play a greater role in binding to IκBβ than they do with IκBα. The fact that IκBβ inhibits the DNA binding of NF-κB more weakly than does IκBα may not necessarily indicate that interactions between IκBβ and NF-κB dimers are of low affinity. To test the affinity of direct physical association between IκBβ and NF-κB dimers, we employed an electrophoretic gel mobility shift competition assay (31Phelps C.B. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29840-29846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this assay, 32P-radiolabeled IκBα in complex with NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer was competed out by increasing amounts of unlabeled IκBβ (Fig. 4 a). We performed similar experiments using IκBα as the unlabeled competitor. Each experiment was performed at least four times, and the concentrations of unlabeled IκBβ and IκBα required to dissociate half of the radiolabeled IκBα were calculated. It is clear from these experiments that IκBα is a stronger competitor than IκBβ, suggesting that IκBα binds more tightly to the NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer. However, the difference in affinity of IκBα and IκBβ toward NF-κB is only on the order of 2–3-fold compared with a much larger disparity observed in the abilities of these inhibitors to disrupt NF-κB DNA binding. Furthermore, the pattern of competitive replacement of radiolabeled IκBα differs between the unlabeled IκBα and IκBβ. IκBβ begins to interfere with NF-κB·IκBα binding at a lower concentration and exhibits a more gradual competitive binding profile (Fig. 4 a, compare lanes 7 and13). Similar experiments have been performed with the p65 homodimer (Fig. 4 b). Again we observe that IκBβ binds p65 homodimer with only 4-fold lower affinity than IκBα. A model that accounts for both the increased dependence of IκBβ on the NF-κB NLS polypeptides and its weaker ability to inhibit NF-κB DNA binding is that, in contrast to IκBα, IκBβ forms high affinity complexes with NF-κB by contacting both NLSs. To test this hypothesis, we performed controlled proteolysis experiments and observed the protection patterns of NF-κB subunit NLSs. E5-IκBβ-(54–331) was complexed with a p65 subunit construct containing only the protease-resistant dimerization domain with the p65 NLS polypeptide attached (amino acids 191–321). After a 1-h incubation with the nonspecific protease thermolysin, most of this p65 remains intact (Fig.5 a, lanes 3–5). Only at longer time points does the NF-κB p65-(191–321) homodimer begin to exhibit partial digestion. The resulting doublet, corresponding to one intact p65-(191–321) and one with the NLS polypeptide removed, suggests that both p65 NLS polypeptides contact IκBβ, albeit asymmetrically. We have analyzed the digested product of the complex by mass spectrometry and observe that the lower band of the doublet corresponds to p65 amino acids 191–311. By comparison, both NLS polypeptides of free p65-(191–321) homodimer are proteolyzed to the stable dimerization domain fragment within minutes of thermolysin treatment (Fig. 5 a,lanes 6–8). Interestingly, when the p65-(19–321)·IκBα complex is treated with thermolysin, approximately half of the p65 is proteolyzed to the dimerization domain fragment within minutes (Fig. 5 b, lanes 2–8). The resulting doublet remains stable indefinitely. This suggests that, unlike IκBβ, IκBα is capable of protecting only one p65 NLS polypeptide from proteolytic cleavage. Having established that IκBβ masks both NF-κB subunit NLSs, we investigated the in vivoconsequences of differential NF-κB interactions by IκBα and IκBβ. First, we determined the subcellular distribution of endogenous IκBβ in p65−/− MEF cells (Fig.6 a). We observe that IκBβ is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, while IκBα is present both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, although a larger fraction is present in the cytoplasm. While the vast majority of IκB proteins exist as complexes with NF-κB, it is possible that at least a fraction of IκBα and IκBβ are present as free proteins in p65−/− MEF cells. Compartmental distribution of IκBα and IκBβ was also determined in cells treated with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) (39Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S.

This result indicates that endogenous IκBβ is cytoplasmic irrespective of its status as a free protein or in complex with NF-κB dimers such as the p50/c-Rel heterodimer or c-Rel homodimer in p65−/− MEF cells. On the other hand, the addition of LMB results in nuclear staining of IκBα. This result suggests that the entire population of IκBα, both free and in complex with NF-κB, participates i"
https://openalex.org/W2171919992,"To what extent the quantal hypothesis of transmitter release applies to dense-core vesicle (DCV) secretion is unknown. We determined the characteristics of individual secretory events in calf chromaffin cells using catecholamine amperometry combined with different patterns of stimulation. Raising the frequency of action potential trains from 0.25–10 Hz in 2 mM [Ca2+]o or [Ca2+]o from 0.25–7 mM at 7 Hz elevated the amount released per event (quantal size). With increased stimulation, quantal size rose continuously, not abruptly, suggesting that release efficiency from a single population of DCVs rather than recruitment of different-sized vesicles contributed to the effect. These results suggest that catecholamine secretion does not conform to the quantal model. Inhibition of rapid endocytosis damped secretion in successive episodes, implying an essential role for this process in the recycling of vesicles needed for continuous secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1994979141,"In this study, we show that the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by N-cadherin is inhibited by a recently developed and highly specific fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) antagonist. To test whether the N-cadherin response also requires FGF function, we developed peptide mimetics of the receptor binding sites on FGFs. Most mimetics inhibit the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by FGF in the absence of any effect on the N-cadherin response. The exceptions to this result were two mimetics of a short FGF1 sequence, which has been shown to interact with the region of the FGFR containing the histidine-alanine-valine motif. These peptides inhibited FGF and N-cadherin responses with similar efficacy. The histidine-alanine-valine region of the FGFR has previously been implicated in the N-cadherin response, and a candidate interaction site has been identified in extracellular domain 4 of N-cadherin. We now show that antibodies directed to this site on N-cadherin inhibit the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by N-cadherin, and peptide mimetics of the site inhibit N-cadherin and FGF responses. Thus, we can conclude that N-cadherin contains a novel motility motif in extracellular domain 4, and that peptide mimetics of this motif can interact with the FGFR.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Similar to other members of this family, the extracellular portion of the molecule is composed of five cadherin domains with a large body of evidence, suggesting that the homophilic binding site resides in the first extracellular domain (ECD1)1 (2Shan W.S. Koch A. Murray J. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Biophys. Chem. 1999; 82: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Koch A.W. Bozic D. Pertz O. Engel J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In the nervous system, N-cadherin function has been implicated in a number of key events that range from the control of axonal growth and guidance (4Matsunaga M. Hatta K. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M.

Neuron. 2000; 28: 245-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In addition to homophilic binding, cadherins have been shown to interact with a number of adaptor or signaling molecules. For example, the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of the classical cadherins with the actin-based cytoskeleton, which is important for adhesion, is mediated by the catenins (10Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 11Hirano S. Kimoto N. Shimoyama Y. Hirohashi S. Takeichi M. Cell. 1992; 70: 293-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). An interaction with a cell surface N-acetylgalactosaminylphosphotransferase has also been reported and implicated in N-cadherin function (12Balsamo J. Lilien J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2923-2928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1β and the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPμ have been shown to bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin and other cadherins and modulate function by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin and/or catenins (13Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Brady-Kalnay S.M. Mourton T. Nixon J.P. Pietz G.E. Kinch M. Chen H. Brackenbury R. Rimm D.L. Del Vecchio R.L. Tonks N.K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 287-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The notion, that the activation of signaling cascades in cells rather than adhesion per se might drive some N-cadherin responses, is supported by the a recent observation that a soluble form of N-cadherin can promote axonal growth (15Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A number of groups have implicated the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in N-cadherin function. For example, neurite outgrowth stimulated by N-cadherin has been shown to be inhibited by a wide variety of agents that inhibit FGFR function in neurons (16Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), including the expression of a dominant negative FGFR (15Utton M.A. Eickholt B. Howell F.V. Wallis J.

Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, N-cadherin can promote “contact-dependent” survival of ovarian granulosa cells in an FGFR-dependent manner (19Trolice M.P. Pappalardo A. Peluso J.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More recently, N-cadherin has been reported to promote the motility of cancer cells with some data suggesting that the FGFR might be involved in this response (20Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 21Nieman M.T. Prudoff R.S. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 631-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear as to whether N-cadherin homophilic binding modulates FGF interactions with the FGFR (20Hazan R.B. Phillips G.R. Qiao R.F. Norton L. Aaronson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), or whether the FGFR requirement reflects a more direct interaction among these molecules (22Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In support of the latter possibility, it has recently been shown that the antibody clustering of N-cadherin in cells is associated with the co-clustering of the FGFR (15Utton M.A. Eickholt B.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have used the structures of a number of FGF/FGFR crystals to develop peptide mimetics of the receptor binding sites on FGFs. The majority of these peptides inhibit the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by FGF in the absence of any effect on the same response stimulated by N-cadherin. The exceptions to this finding are two mimetics of a short sequence on FGF1 that interacts with the histidine-alanine-valine (HAV) region of the FGFRs; these peptides inhibited the FGF and N-cadherin responses with similar efficacy. Previous studies have implicated the HAV region of the FGFR in the N-cadherin response (16Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) and identified a candidate interaction motif in ECD4 of N-cadherin (22Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that antibodies that bind to this motif in neurons specifically inhibit N-cadherin function. Furthermore, peptide mimetics of the N-cadherin motif inhibit N-cadherin and FGF function with similar efficacy. Thus, we have defined a novel functional motif in the ECD4 of N-cadherin and provided a clear framework for understanding, at least in part, the molecular basis for an N-cadherin/FGFR interaction. BT-549, MCF-7, MDA-MB-436, and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell lines, COS-7 cells, the L6 muscle cell line, and various 3T3 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). L6 cells expressing the full-length human FGFR1(25) (denoted as L6* cells in this study) were maintained in DME/10% FCS containing 0.72 mg/ml G418. Co-cultures of cerebellar neurons on monolayers of parental 3T3 cells or established transfected 3T3 cell lines that express physiological levels of chick N-cadherin (the LK8 cell line), human L1, or human NCAM were established as described previously (16Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). ∼80,000 3T3 cells in DME/10% FCS were plated into individual chambers of an 8-chamber tissue culture slide coated with poly-l-lysine and fibronectin. After 24 h to allow for monolayer formation, the medium was removed, and 3000 dissociated cerebellar neurons (taken from postnatal day 2 rats) were plated into each well in SATO medium supplemented with 2% FCS. Test reagents including FGF2 at 1 ng/ml were added as indicated in the text, and the co-cultures were maintained for 18 h. The co-cultures were then fixed and stained for GAP-43 immunoreactivity. The mean length of the longest neurite/cell was measured for ∼120–150 neurons in each population, again as described previously (for review see Ref. 16Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P.

A rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide that corresponds to a region of N-cadherin ECD4 (RYTKLSDPANWLKIDPVNGQIT). The antiserum was affinity purified against the peptide immunogen and stored as a stock at 40 μg/ml in PBS/glycerol at −20 °C (50:50). A monovalent F(ab′) fraction of the whole antiserum was also prepared by standard methods and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and stored as a stock at 33 mg/ml at 4 °C. The titer of the affinity purified antibody against native N-cadherin was characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 2 μg/ml N-cadherin-Fc chimera (15Utton M.A. Eickholt B.

The plates were then washed twice with DME followed by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin/DME at 37 °C for 30 min to block nonspecific protein binding sites. The plates were incubated with a range of concentrations of the affinity purified anti-N-cadherin antibody in DME/10% FCS overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed 3 times with DME and bound antibody detected after incubation with an anti rabbit-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:1000 in DME/10% FCS for 1 h at room temperature). The amount of bound horseradish peroxidase was determined using SIGMA FAST TM OPD peroxidase substrate according to manufacturer instructions. For Western blot analysis, confluent cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and “complete” protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min with agitation. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 5 min and the supernatants were used for Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk/PBS and then incubated for 1 h with the affinity purified fraction of the rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N-cadherin ECD4 peptide (see above) at a dilution of 1:1000 (dilutions of stock in 2% milk/0.05% Tween 20/PBS). Membranes were then washed with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and then incubated for 1 h with a 1:3000 dilution of an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate in 2% milk/0.05% Tween 20/PBS. The membranes were washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS before probing with ECL or ECL PLUS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Fry D.W. Bradford L. Hallak H. Doherty A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 2296-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence supports the view that neurite outgrowth stimulated by N-cadherin requires the presence of a functional FGFR in neurons (34Doherty P. Williams G. Williams E.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, the validity of conclusions based on the use of kinase-deleted “dominant negative” forms of the FGFR have recently been challenged (35Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test whether the catalytic activity of the FGFR is required for the N-cadherin response, we took advantage of the recent development of a highly specific antagonist (PD 173074) that binds to the ATP binding pocket of the FGFR (31Mohammadi M. Froum S. Hamby J.M. Schroeder M.C. Panek R.L. Lu G.H. Eliseenkova A.V. Green D. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5896-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). We cultured rat cerebellar granule cells for ∼18 h over monolayers of control 3T3 cells and monolayers of transfected 3T3 cells that express physiological levels of N-cadherin (the LK8 cell line). As expected, the neurons extended longer neurites on the N-cadherin-expressing monolayers (Fig.1). This response was fully inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by PD 173074 (Fig. 1 A). When cerebellar granule cells are grown over monolayers of 3T3 fibroblasts that express physiological levels of two additional cell adhesion molecules (NCAM and L1) or in the presence of FGF2, a neurite outgrowth response that is similar to the N-cadherin response is found (16Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 36Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Development. 1994; 120: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PD 173074 also inhibited the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by NCAM, L1, and FGF2 with a dose-response curve that is similar to the inhibition of the N-cadherin response (Fig.1 B). Arachidonic acid is a key second messenger in the signal transduction cascade that couples the activated FGFR to the neurite outgrowth response (37Williams E.J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1231-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When tested at up to 1 μm, PD 173074 does not inhibit the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by arachidonic acid (32Skaper S.D. Kee W.J. Facci L. Macdonald G. Doherty P. Walsh F.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1520-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this demonstrates that it has no nonspecific effects on neurite outgrowth at any downstream step in the pathway that couples the activated FGFR to the response. The fact that the FGFR is required for the N-cadherin response begs the question as to whether FGFs are also required for this response. Recent observations from a number of FGF/FGFR crystal complexes has led to a consensus on how FGFs interact with the receptor (27Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 28Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J.

A. 2000; 97: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The contact profile for the FGF1/FGFR2 interaction is shown in Fig.2 with an essentially identical profile found for the other FGF/FGFR interactions (29Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Four major linear clusters of amino acids on FGF1 account for most of the binding to the FGFR. It follows that peptide mimetics of these clusters might be capable of inhibiting FGF function by binding back to the receptors. In this study, we made linear peptide mimetics to three partially overlapping sites from cluster 1 and single peptide mimetics for clusters 2, 3, and 4. In addition, we made cyclic versions of two of the cluster 1 peptides. All of the peptides were initially tested at 100 μg/ml for their ability to inhibit the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by FGF2 with the results summarized in TableI. Although all of the peptides showed significant inhibitory activity, peptide mimetics of cluster 1 and cluster 2 were the most active in the assay, and therefore, full dose response curves to these peptides were obtained (Fig.3). The results show that these peptides can inhibit the FGF2 response with IC50 values ranging from ∼20 to 65 μm. The data also clearly show that the peptides do not inhibit basal neurite outgrowth over 3T3 cell monolayers, and we can, therefore, conclude that they do not have any nonspecific effects on neurons. Arachidonic acid is a key second messenger in the pathway that couples the activation of the FGFR to the neurite outgrowth response (36Williams E.J. Furness J. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Development. 1994; 120: 1685-1693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and at the highest concentration tested (100 μg/ml), none of the above peptides inhibited the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by 10 μm arachidonic acid (data not shown). Thus, we can conclude that the above peptides inhibit FGF2 responses at the level of ligand interaction with the FGFR.Table IThe effects of peptide mimetics of FGFR binding sites on the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by FGF and N-cadherinClusterSequenceInhibitionFGFNCAD1-aNCAD, monolayers of N-cadherin.%1a21GNYKKPK2791 ± 1012 ± 4.6Cyclic peptide11 ± 1.71b25HFKDPKRLY3397 ± 5.52 ± 7.81c30YCSNGGHF3765 ± 3.078 ± 10.4Cyclic peptide78 ± 6.2261LSAESVGEVY7076 ± 6.114 ± 1.43102ERLEENHYN11030 ± 5.22 ± 2.74148LPLPVSSD15546 ± 5.810 ± 0.3Neurons were cultured on parental 3T3 monolayers in control medium or medium containing FGF2 (1 ng/ml) or on monolayers of 3T3 cells that express physiological levels of transfected N-cadherin (the LK8 cell line).

In the case of the 21GNYKKPK27and 30YCSNGGHF37 motifs, the results obtained with the linear and cyclic peptides were not distinguishable, and these have been pooled for inhibition of the FGF2 response. In contrast to their effects on the neurite outgrowth response stimulated by FGF2, 6 out of the 8 peptides had no effect on the N-cadherin response (Table I). Of the eight peptide mimetics of the FGFR binding sites, two inhibited the N-cadherin response just as well as the FGF2 response (Table I and Fig.4 A). We analyzed the FGF/FGFR crystals to identify potential binding sites for the peptides. In this context, both peptides (N-Ac-YCSNGGHF-NH2 and N-Ac-YCSNGGHFC-NH2) are mimetics of a short FGF1 sequence that makes extensive and relatively exclusive contacts with the HAV region of the FGFRs (see Fig. 4 B for details). In contrast, the other peptides are mimetics of sequences that make extensive contacts with the linker region between the Ig domain 2 and 3 or with Ig domain 3 (data not shown). Thus, we can conclude that although FGF-derived peptides that target the HAV region of the FGFR can inhibit both FGF and N-cadherin responses, a number of other peptides that target other regions of the FGFR exclusively inhibit the FGF response. Based on homology with peptide sequences that interact with the HAV region of N-cadherin, we have identified the IDPVNGQ motif from ECD4 of N-cadherin as a candidate binding motif for the HAV region of the FGFR (22Doherty P. Walsh F.S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 99-111Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar). If the IDPVNGQ motif within ECD4 of N-cadherin is a functional motif capable of interacting with the HAV region of the FGFR, then peptide mimetics of the sequence would also be expected to inhibit N-cadherin and FGF responses by binding back to the HAV region of the receptor. To test this, we made a short synthetic peptide (N-Ac-IDPVNGQ-NH2) and tested it in the neurite outgrowth assays. The results in Fig. 5 Ademonstrate that this peptide can inhibit the N-cadherin and FGF responses with similar efficacy. Again, the peptide had no effect on basal neurite outgrowth over 3T3 monolayers. We also tested a longer version of the peptide primarily in the N-cadherin assay (N-Ac-WLKIDPVNGQI-NH2). This peptide was moderately better than the shorter peptide at inhibiting the N-cadherin response (IC50 = ∼60 μm as compared with ∼100 μm, see Fig. 5 B). When we substituted a single isoleucine to alanine (N-Ac-WLKADPVNGQI-NH2) or proline to alanine (N-Ac-WLKIDAVNGQI-NH2), we saw an approximate 3-fold reduction in the efficacy of the longer peptide (IC50 = ∼180 μm). Finally, when we tested the double mutant (N-Ac-WLKADAVNGQI-NH2), we found essentially a complete loss of inhibitory activity (Fig.5 B). The longer peptide also inhibited the FGF2 response, and this activity was lost with the double mutation (data not shown). To further test whether the ECD4 of N-cadherin contains a functional motif required for the neurite outgrowth response, a rabbit antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide that contains the"
https://openalex.org/W2042838756,"We describe here a general technique for the graded inhibition of cellular excitability in vivo. Inhibition is accomplished by expressing a genetically modified Shaker K(+) channel (termed the EKO channel) in targeted cells. Unlike native K(+) channels, the EKO channel strongly shunts depolarizing current: activating at potentials near E(K) and not inactivating. Selective targeting of the channel to neurons, muscles, and photoreceptors in Drosophila using the Gal4-UAS system results in physiological and behavioral effects consistent with attenuated excitability in the targeted cells, often with loss of neuronal function at higher transgene dosages. By permitting the incremental reduction of electrical activity, the EKO technique can be used to address a wide range of questions regarding neuronal function."

These putative Bax and Bak pores reside in the outer mitochondrial membrane, but whether Bax or Bak oligomeric complexes that may make up these pores contain other proteins, is not known. TNF-α signaling, however, requires either Bax or Bak, which implement the release of cytochromec from mitochondria. 2K. Degenhardt, R. Sundararajan, T. Lindsten, C. B. Thompson, and E. White, manuscript submitted.2K. Degenhardt, R. Sundararajan, T. Lindsten, C. B. Thompson, and E. White, manuscript submitted. Released cytochrome c functions, perhaps in concert with other released mitochondrial proteins, as a cofactor for caspase-9 activation. Active caspase-9 then facilitates caspase-3 activation, substrate cleavage, and cell death by apoptosis. How Bax or Bak oligomerize to form pores to release cytochromec, and possibly other proteins such as Smac/DIABLO, which is an inhibitor of a caspase-9 inhibitor (12Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

It is also unclear whether Bax or Bak generate separate pores, or how their function is regulated. The adenovirus E1B 19K protein, however, is a potent inhibitor of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis and has been a useful tool in elucidating death signaling events at the level of the mitochondria (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar,10Sundararajan R. White E. J.

DNA viruses, including adenovirus, have evolved multiple functions to disable apoptotic signaling by TNF-α, likely as part of their repertoire of functions to sustain the viability of infected host cells until the virus life cycle is complete (16Wold W.S.M. Doronin K. Toth K. Kuppuswamy M. Lichtenstein D.L. Tollefson A.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The adenovirus E1B 19K protein functions as an apoptosis inhibitor during productive virus infection of human cells, and by the p53 tumor suppressor protein in oncogenic transformation of primary rodent epithelial cells (17White E. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 505-513Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In infected cells, E1B 19K blocks apoptosis induced by deregulation of the cell cycle by adenovirus E1A expression, as well as that induced by TNF-α. Infection with viruses that lack E1B 19K causes infected cells to die by E1A-mediated apoptosis, and infected cells become exquisitely sensitive to TNF-α-mediated death signaling (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Gooding L.R. Aquino L. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Day D. Horton T.M. Yei S. Wold W.S.M. J.

E1B 19K expression alone is sufficient to confer resistance to TNF-α, demonstrating that this function is independent of the presence of any other adenovirus proteins (15White E. Sabbatini P. Debbas M. Wold W.S.M. Kusher D.I. Gooding L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2570-2580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E1B 19K is homologous in sequence and in function to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein (17White E. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 505-513Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Examination of the point at which E1B 19K blocked death signaling by TNF-α during virus infection revealed that inhibition of the pathway took place at the level of the mitochondria (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Those events upstream of the mitochondria, specifically caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage to tBid, take place normally whether viruses expressed E1B 19K or not. In contrast, mitochondrial events, and those downstream, namely cytochrome c release, caspase-9 and -3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin cleavage, and apoptosis, are inhibited in wild-type but not E1B 19K mutant virus-infected cells (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These observations led to scrutiny of mitochondrial death signaling events as likely targets for E1B 19K inhibition. TNF-α-induced generation of tBid causes tBid to bind to Bax, and probably also Bak, which results in a conformational change in the Bax amino terminus by a hit-and-run mechanism (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). E1B 19K neither binds Bid or tBid, nor does its expression prevent tBid-Bax interaction or the conformational change in the Bax amino terminus (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Rather, this amino-terminal altered Bax binds E1B 19K, and Bax oligomerization into a 500-kDa high molecular mass complex is inhibited in infected cells treated with TNF-α (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). E1B 19K-Bax complex formation also blocks the occurrence or detection of the conformational change in the Bax carboxyl terminus (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These profound effects of E1B 19K on Bax protein complex formation in mitochondria indicated a role for Bax in death receptor signaling pathways. How Bcl-2 family members may regulate mitochondrial death signaling was suggested from studies of homologous bacterial proteins. Bax and other Bcl-2 family members share structural homology to the pore-forming domains of bacterial toxins, which also undergo changes in conformation followed by membrane insertion and oligomerization to form a membrane pore (18Aritomi M.

These structure-function parallels are also mirrored by E1B 19K and bacterial immunity proteins (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which can block membrane pore formation by interacting with and inhibiting oligomerization of the toxin pore-forming domain (25Gazit E.

Whether the E1B 19K-Bax interaction is sufficient to explain inhibition of TNF-α-mediated apoptosis remained to be determined. We report here that TNF-α induced an interaction between Bak and Bax and both proteins oligomerize. In wild-type virus-infected cells, E1B 19K was constitutively bound to Bak and prevented Bak-Bax interaction and oligomerization stimulated by TNF-α. The TNF-α-stimulated release of not only cytochrome c but also Smac/DIABLO was specifically inhibited by E1B 19K expression in virus-infected cells. Although tBid can independently bind Bax and alter its conformation to permit E1B 19K binding, the redundant functional activities of Bax and Bak may require inhibition of both by E1B 19K to effect inhibition of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release from mitochondria in TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. Finally, cooperative binding between Bax and Bak may facilitate Bax oligomerization and efficient formation of mitochondrial membrane pores. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal E1B 19K antibody generated against baculovirus expressed, full-length recombinant E1B 19K protein (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal Bax antibody Bax-(11–30) directed against amino acids 11–30 of human Bax (Bax N-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit polyclonal Bax antibody Bax-(43–61) directed against amino acids 43–61 of human Bax (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); rabbit polyclonal Bak antibody generated against recombinant human Bak protein lacking the putative transmembrane region (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); rabbit polyclonal Bak antibody Bak NT directed against amino acids 23–37 of human Bak (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); rabbit polyclonal Bak antibody Bak-(14–36) directed against 14–36 of human Bak (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); rabbit polyclonal BRCA-2 antibody directed against amino acids 2587–2601 of human BRCA-2 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody which recognized the native conformation (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); mouse monoclonal cytochrome c antibody which recognized the denatured protein (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); and mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COXII) (Molecular Probes). The anti-Smac/DIABLO rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated as follows: sequences encoding amino acids 95–239 of human Smac/DIABLO were polymerase chain reaction-subcloned into the pCRT7/NT-TOPO vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the primers 5′-GCGTTGATTGAAGCTATTACTGAATATACTAAGGC-3′ and 5′-AGACAGGGCAGTGTGCTCAGGCCCTCAATC-3′. Recombinant histidine-tagged fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli BL21, and purified using the Xpress system for protein purification (InVitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions using a denaturing purification scheme. Purified, recombinant Smac/DIABLO fusion protein was then gel isolated, and used for immunization in rabbits to generate the polyclonal antiserum. Adenoviruses Ad5dl309 and Ad5dl337 were obtained from Dr. T. Shenk (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ). Ad5dl309 has a deletion in the E3 gene and was used as the wild-type virus (30Jones N. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Ad5dl337 was derived from Ad5dl309 and has a deletion in the E1B 19K gene (31Pilder S. Logan J. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 664-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 100 as previously described (32White E. Blose S.H. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2865-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were untreated or treated for 4 h with TNF-α and a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (TNF/CHX) (2000 units/ml TNF-α (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and 30 μg/ml CHX (Sigma)) to block the NFκB-activated survival pathway as previously described (7Perez D.

For gel filtration chromatography, 2.5 × 107 HeLa cells were mock, Ad5dl309-, or Ad5dl337-infected for 24 h and were then untreated or treated with TNF/CHX for 4 h. Cell lysates prepared in CHAPS (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2% CHAPS) at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was loaded onto the column. The Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography was carried out as previously described (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as previously described (33Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and probed with the Bax-(11–30) or Bak NT antibodies. 1 × 107 HeLa cells were mock or Ad5dl309 infected for 24 h and were then untreated or treated with TNF/CHX for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates prepared in HEPES-CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2% CHAPS) at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml were incubated with 1 or 5 mm 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) or Me2SO alone for 2 h at 4 °C, and quenching carried out as previously described (8Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microprecipitates formed were spun down at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. 23 μl out of the 1 ml of cross-linked lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blotting with the Bax-(11–30) antibody, Bak NT antibody, or E1B 19K polyclonal antibody. HeLa cell immunoprecipitations were carried out as previously described (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), except that all cells were harvested and resuspended in CHAPS lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, as previously described (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The protein A-Sepharose was washed four times in a 0.5% CHAPS buffer. Whole cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with the Bax-(11–30), Bak NT, and E1B 19K antibodies. 7 × 106 HeLa cells were either mock infected or infected with Ad5dl309 or Ad5dl337 for 24 h, followed by treatment with either TNF/CHX or CHX alone for 4 h. Attached and floating cells were harvested by scraping into the growth medium and centrifugation, washed with PBS, and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in Buffer I (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.32 m sucrose, 42 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, plus protease inhibitors as above). The suspension was incubated on ice 20 min. Using a 1-ml syringe, cells were lyzed by passage through a 26-gauge needle 10 times, followed by passage through a 30-gauge needle 30 times. A 100-μl sample of whole cell (total) extract was retained, and the extract was centrifuged at 400 ×g for 10 min, 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Buffer II (identical to Buffer I, minus sucrose and including 1.0% Triton X-100 for solubilization of the pellet) and retained as the heavy membrane/mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the S-100 was retained as the cytosolic fraction. 10 μl of total extract, and 20 μl each of the mitochondrial/heavy membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively, were subjected to 17% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to 0.2-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) for Smac/DIABLO blotting, and 0.45-μm pore size polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COXII) blotting. Western blotting was performed as previously described (33Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), using the antidenatured cytochrome c antibody, Smac/DIABLO antibody, or COXII antibody. 1 × 106 HeLa cells/plate were grown on glass coverslips and infected with Ad5dl309, Ad5dl337, or were mock infected for 24 h. Cells were treated with TNF/CHX, or with CHX alone, for 4 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (33Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Coverslips for Smac/DIABLO staining were subjected to epitope retrieval by heating them to 91 °C for 15 min in PBS, followed by immediate transfer to PBS at 25 °C. Coverslips were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin/PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and stained with Smac/DIABLO antiserum diluted 1:200 in PBS with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Unheated coverslips were stained with anti-native cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), diluted 1:60 as above. Staining was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy as described previously (33Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and percentages of cells with cytosolic or mitochondrial Smac/DIABLO or cytochrome cstaining were determined by scoring ∼250 cells on duplicate coverslips. Antibodies directed against specific epitopes have indicated that Bax undergoes defined and discrete conformational changes revealed by differential exposure of epitopes in the absence and presence of death signaling (4Desagher S.

Death signaling by TNF-α induces a tBid-dependent conformational change in the Bax amino terminus indicated by exposure of an amino-terminal Bax epitope (7Perez D. White E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Bak also undergoes an amino-terminal conformational change in TNF/CHX cells (data not shown), which is likely also due to tBid-Bak interaction (6Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). A second conformational change in the carboxyl-terminal BH2 region of Bax is also revealed by exposure of that epitope upon treatment of cells with TNF/CHX (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An epitope in an unstructured loop region of Bax between amino acids 43 and 61, however, remains exposed independent of a death stimulus and Bax is efficiently immunoprecipitated from cells in the absence or presence of TNF/CHX (Fig. 1) (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Infection of HeLa cells with wild-type adenovirus Ad5dl309 and expression of the E1B 19K protein, or infection with the E1B 19K deletion mutant virus Ad5dl337 also did not affect Bax immunoprecipitation by the Bax-(43–61) loop antibody (Fig. 1) (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When the Bax immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Bak antibody, Bak was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with Bax only from cells treated with TNF/CHX (Fig. 1). Infection with Ad5dl309 and E1B 19K expression greatly diminished co-immunoprecipitation of Bax with Bak induced by TNF/CHX (Fig. 1), while inducing an E1B 19K-Bax association (Fig. 1) as reported previously (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Infection with the E1B 19K viral mutant Ad5dl337 induced Bax-Bak co-immunoprecipitation even in the absence of TNF/CHX, that was further stimulated by TNF/CHX (Fig. 1). As this virus induces E1A-mediated apoptosis because it lacks E1B 19K, it may also do so by promoting Bax-Bak complex formation in a similar manner to TNF/CHX. Immunoprecipitation of Bak similarly revealed TNF/CHX-dependent or Ad5dl337-induced co-immunoprecipitation of Bak with Bax, which was greatly diminished by E1B 19K expression during viral infection (Fig. 1). As Ad5dl337 lacks E1B 19K, apoptosis is induced by E1A in infected cells. E1B 19K, however, co-immunoprecipitated with Bak equally in the presence and absence of TNF/CHX (Fig. 1). Thus, death signaling by either TNF/CHX or E1A induced Bax-Bak complex formation that was inhibited by E1B 19K expression during virus infection. Since E1B 19K is constitutively bound to Bak in infected cells, 19K-Bak complex formation may prevent Bak as well as Bax oligomerization, Bak-Bax complex formation, and co-oligomerization and apoptosis. Gel filtration chromatography has been useful in the characterization of changes in Bax and Bak protein complexes stimulated by death signaling through mitochondria (9Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.-C. Biochemistry. 2000; 345: 271-278Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential for modulation of Bak protein complexes by TNF/CHX and E1B 19K, HeLa cells were infected with the wild-type virus Ad5dl309 or the E1B 19K deletion mutant virus Ad5dl337, and were then untreated or treated with TNF/CHX. Lysates prepared in CHAPS lysis buffer were fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column. Western blotting of the column fractions with a Bax antibody demonstrated that Bax is monomeric in healthy cells but is recruited into a 500-kDa complex resolved by gel filtration chromatography in cells treated with TNF/CHX (Fig.2) (10Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ability of apoptotic signaling to stimulate the formation of Bax into large protein complexes, and the ability of Bax to homodimerize and oligomerize in mitochondrial membranes, suggests that Bax may form a membrane pore for the release of proteins from mitochondria (10Sundararajan R.

Enhancer of zeste (E(Z)) is a Drosophila PcG protein that previously has been shown to bind directly to another PcG protein, Extra Sex Combs (ESC), and is present along with ESC in a 600-kDa complex inDrosophila embryos. Using yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, we show that E(Z) binds directly to another PcG protein, Polycomblike (PCL). PCL·E(Z) interaction is shown to be mediated by the plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers domain of PCL, providing evidence that this motif can act as an independent protein interaction domain. An association was also observed between PHF1 and EZH2, human homologs of PCL and E(Z), respectively, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of this interaction. E(Z) was found to not interact with the PHD domains of threeDrosophila trithorax group (trxG) proteins, which function to maintain the transcriptional activity of homeotic genes, providing evidence for the specificity of the interaction of E(Z) with the PCL PHD domain. Coimmunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments demonstrate in vivo association of PCL with E(Z) and ESC inDrosophila embryos. We discuss the implications of PCL association with ESC·E(Z) complexes and the possibility that PCL may either be a subunit of a subset of ESC·E(Z) complexes or a subunit of a separate complex that interacts with ESC·E(Z) complexes."

Inherited deficiency of sialidase results in sialidosis or galactosialidosis, both severe metabolic disorders associated with lysosomal storage of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides. Sialidase also plays an important role in cellular signaling and is specifically required for the production of cytokine interleukin-4 by activated T lymphocytes. In these cells,neu-1-encoded sialidase activity is increased on the cell surface, suggesting that a specific mechanism regulates sorting of this enzyme to the plasma membrane. We investigated that mechanism by first showing that sialidase contains the internalization signal found in lysosomal membrane proteins targeted to endosomes via clathrin-coated pits. The signal consists of a C-terminal tetrapeptide412YGTL415, with Tyr412 and Leu415 essential for endocytosis of the enzyme. We further demonstrated that redistribution of sialidase from lysosomes to the cell surface of activated lymphocytes is accompanied by increased reactivity of the enzyme with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. We speculate that phosphorylation of Tyr412 results in inhibition of sialidase internalization in activated lymphocytes.

In the lysosome, sialidase is associated with lysosomal carboxypeptidase A (also cathepsin A or protective protein), β-galactosidase andN-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase in a multienzyme complex (1d'Azzo A.

Dissociation of the complex in vitro results in complete inactivation of sialidase, although activity can be restored after the reconstitution of the complex (2van der Horst G.T.

These results suggest that association with the complex is required for sialidase to adopt its catalytically active conformation, but direct structural data are not available to support this mechanism. Inherited mutations in cathepsin A result in disruption of the complex and cause galactosialidosis, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by combined deficiency of sialidase, β-galactosidase, and cathepsin A (4d'Azzo A. Andria G. Strisciuglio P. Galijaard H. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3811-3826Google Scholar). Another autosomal recessive disease, sialidosis, is caused by mutations directly affecting the lysosomal sialidase gene (5Thomas G.H. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 3507-3534Google Scholar). Various data obtained during the purification of sialidase from different tissues have demonstrated the existence of two pools of lysosomal sialidase, soluble and membrane-associated. Both forms appear to be encoded by a single gene, since they are absent from cultured cells of sialidosis patients (6Miyagi T. Hata K. Hasegawa A. Aoyagi T. Glycoconj. J. 1993; 10: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Verheijen F.W. Janse H.C. van Diggelen O.P. Bakker H.D. Loonen M.C. Durand P. Galjaard H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using immunoelectron microscopy, we have demonstrated the presence of sialidase on lysosomal membranes and within the lumen of lysosomes, as well as on plasma membranes of transfected cells (8Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, activated T lymphocytes exhibit severalfold increase of sialidase activity on their cell surfaces (9Landolfi N.F. Leone J. Womack J.E. Cook R.G. Immunogenetics. 1985; 22: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,10Naraparaju V.R. Yamamoto N. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 43: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Lysosomal sialidase and the sialidase expressed on the cell surface are products of the same gene, since cell surface expression does not occur in T-cells obtained from SM/J or SM/B10 mice that have mutation in the neu-1-encoded sialidase (11Carrillo M.B. Milner C.N. Ball S.T. Snock M. Campbell R.D. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 975-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a specific mechanism exists for sorting newly synthesized sialidase to the plasma membrane and the lysosome, as well as for retention of sialidase on the plasma membrane. Previous studies have described several pathways for sorting lysosomal membrane proteins and endocytosed receptors to thetrans-Golgi network (TGN),1 plasma membrane, and endosome. All these cargo proteins contain amino acid motifs with conserved tyrosine or dileucine residues recognized by adaptor protein (AP) complexes. These coat proteins form vesicles destined for the lysosome (12Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 13Peters C. von Figura K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Pearse B.M. Smith C.J. Owen D.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Two adaptor complexes, AP1 and AP2, are associated with clathrin-coated vesicles derived from the Golgi and the plasma membrane, respectively. Both AP1 and AP2 contain μ-subunits (μ1 and μ2, respectively) that recognize and bind to the internalization signals of their cargo proteins (15Jarousee N. Kelly R.B. Traffic. 2000; 1: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The AP3 adaptor complex is required for the formation of lysosomal/endosomal vesicles from the TGN. Proteins targeted to these vesicles contain tyrosine-based internalization signals, and genetic deficiency of AP3 in the cells of patients suffering from Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) results in increased surface expression of such proteins (16Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cells. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In this study we obtained direct evidence that sialidase is synthesized and transported to the lysosomes as a membrane-bound protein. We show that the C terminus of sialidase contains a tyrosine-based internalization signal represented by the tetrapeptide412YGTL415, which can be inactivated by mutating the essential Tyr412 and Leu415residues. Human liver tissues obtained from the materials discarded during a reduced liver transplantation were homogenized in isotonic (0.25 m) sucrose buffered with 10 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA (homogenization buffer) using a Teflon and glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The nuclei, cell debris, and heavy mitochondria were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 3,000 × g. A “light mitochondrial fraction” containing the lysosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and partially microsomes was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatants at 16,000 × g for 18 min. Lysosomes were purified from the light mitochondrial fraction by the ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g for 3 h in a Beckman VTi 65 vertical rotor) in a self-forming density gradient of metrizamide (OptiPrep, Nycomed) as described (17Wattiaux R. Wattiaux-De Conninck S. Iodinated Density Gradient Media: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983Google Scholar). Immediately after centrifugation each tube was divided into 15 fractions using a Beckman Tube slicer kit. Each fraction was assayed for activities of lysosomal membrane and matrix enzymes, marker enzymes for mitochondria, plasma membranes, peroxisomes, and Golgi as well as for the presence of the lysosomal membrane marker protein LAMP-2 by Western blot as described below. The gradient fractions containing the “light” lysosomes were pooled, diluted with 3 volumes of the homogenization buffer, and centrifuged for 20 min at 35,000 × g to obtain the lysosomal pellet. For the purification of lysosomal membranes, the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold water containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sonicated twice for 5 s at 50 W. Membranes were precipitated by a 1 h centrifugation at 100,000 × g and washed several times with ice-cold water containing the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The same procedure was used for the purification of lysosomal membranes from COS-7 cells, but the glass and glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer was used for the homogenization of the cells and during the first centrifugation step the speed was reduced to 1000 × g. The lysosomal membranes were purified 150–200-fold compared with the homogenate as determined by the increase of specific activity of the marker enzyme, β-glucosidase, and were not cross-contaminated by microsomal (marker enzyme, UDP-galactosyl transferase) or plasma (marker enzyme, alkaline phosphatase) membranes. The average yield (measured as the total activity of β-glucosidase recovered in the lysosomal fraction) was about 20–30% as compared with the homogenate. Sialidase substitution mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction (18Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). First, using the pCMV-SIAL (19Pshezhetsky A.V. Richard C. Michaud L. Igdoura S. Wang S. Elsliger M.A. Qu J. Leclerc D. Gravel R. Dallaire L. Potier M. Nat.

Fragments AC and BD were linked by overlap polymerase chain reaction using primers A and D to obtain the product containing the desired mutation. In particular, TAT codon of Tyr412 was changed to GCT, GGG codon of Gly413 to GCG, and CTC codon of Leu415 to GCC.KpnI/EcoRV restriction fragments containing the introduced mutations were subcloned into the pCMV-SIAL plasmid.

Sialidase,N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase, β-galactosidase, and β-glucosidase activities were assayed in cellular homogenates using the corresponding 4-methylumbelliferyl (muf)-glycoside substrates as described (21Potier M.

Biophys. 1994; 313: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cathepsin B activity was assayed with Z-Arg-Arg-βNA (25Gingras R. Richard C. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V.

Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured with the assay kit (Sigma) using the manufacturer's protocol. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the wild-type human sialidase and cathepsin A cDNA. 48 h after transfection cell aliquotes (∼6 million cells) were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) and sonicated by 3 pulses, 5 s each at 50 W. After centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g, the supernatant (S1) was collected and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2), containing 1% (w/v) of Zwitterionic detergent 3–12, sonicated and centrifuged as before. The supernatant (S2) was collected and the pellet (P2) was resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mmacetate buffer (pH 5.2). Buffer (S1) and detergent (S2) extracts as well as the homogenate of cell pellet (P2) were assayed for protein and for the activities of sialidase, β-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, and cathepsin A as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection with wild-type or mutant sialidase, COS-7 cells were treated for 40 min with LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) dye, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 40 min. Cells were permeabilized by 0.3% Triton X-100, washed twice with PBS, and stained with rabbit anti-sialidase antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies against rabbit IgG. Alternatively cells were double stained with rabbit anti-sialidase antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against LAMP-2 (Washington Biotechnology Inc., Baltimore, MD). Skin fibroblasts of normal controls and of a HPS type 2 patient (cell line 42) were treated with LysoTracker Red, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with primary anti-sialidase and anti-LAMP-2 antibodies similar to COS-7 cells. Slides were counterstained with Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Slides were studied on a Zeiss LSM410 inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood). Antibody internalization assay was performed as described (16Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cells. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Normal and HPS-2 fibroblasts grown on glass coverslips were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of primary anti-sialidase antibodies diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Subsequently the cells were washed 3 times 5 min each with ice-cold PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, blocked, permeabilized, and stained with Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as described above. For the purification of lysosomal membranes, 48 h after transfection, COS-7 cells from one T-25 flask were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution and then scraped in the presence of ice-cold homogenization buffer. Cells were homogenized by 20 strokes in glass and glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and the procedure for purification of lysosomal membranes followed as described above for human liver. The only modification was the reduced speed (1000g versus 3000 g) during the first centrifugation step. Plasma membranes were purified as described (26Kalish D.I. Cohen C.M. Jacobson B.S. Branton D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 506: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by binding COS-7 cells to Cytodex 1 beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Québec). The preparation was enriched ∼80-fold by following the specific activity of alkaline phosphatase and did not contain lysosomal marker enzymes (β-hexosaminidase, β-galactosidase, or β-glucosidase). To measure the sialidase activity on the outer cell surface, the cells seeded in 6-well culture dishes were washed several times with Hank's balanced salt solution and overlaid with 500 μl of 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.2), 0.25 m sucrose, and 0.4 mm sialidase substrate, MufNANA. After 30 min of incubation, 200-μl aliquots of medium were added to 1.8 ml of 0.4m glycine buffer (pH 10.4), and the concentration of the product was measured as described (21Potier M. Mameli L. Belisle M. Dallaire L. Melançon S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). To measure the total amount of enzyme, the assay was performed in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred to polyvinyldifluoride membrane. The sialidase and cathepsin A detection was performed with rabbit antibodies as described (8Vinogradova M.V. Michaud L. Mezentsev A.V. Lukong K.E. El-Alfy M. Morales C.R. Potier M. Pshezhetsky A.V.

The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were purified from heparinized peripheral blood obtained from apparently healthy adult donors after informed consent. The blood was centrifuged over Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Montreal, Quebec) density gradients and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected as described (29Ahmad A. Sharif-Askari E. Fawaz L. Menezes J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7196-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with concanavalin A (20 μg/ml; Sigma) in RPMI 1640 containing recombinant human IL-2 (100 units/ml; Cetus), 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units of penicillin and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml) as described (30Iida T. Ohno H. Nakaseko C. Sakuma M. Takeda-Ezaki M. Arase H. Kominami E. Fujisawa T. Saito T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5062-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After incubation at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2atmosphere for 3 days, the cells were collected for analysis. Sialidase activity on the surface of lymphocytes was measured as described for COS-7 cells. To measure the total amount of the enzyme the assay was performed in the presence of 0.3% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation 15 × 106 cells were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS then lyzed by sonication in 1 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) supplemented with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, complete protease inhibitory mixture (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and 1 mm α-toluensulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. 1.0 ml of lysate was incubated for 4 h with preimmune serum at a final dilution of 1/20. Then the pellet obtained from 300 μl of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) was added and the resulting suspension was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated overnight with the antisialidase antibodies at a 1/100 final dilution, then for 2 h at 4 °C with the pellet from 100 μl of Pansorbin cells and precipitated as above. The pellet was washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer. The antigens were eluted from the pellet by the addition of 100 μl of a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min and 50 μl of each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the proteins were electrotransferred from gels to nitrocellulose membrane. The sialidase detection was performed with rabbit antibodies and phosphotyrosine detection with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine Ab-1 antibodies (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) using the Vectastain ABC-Amp kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. For confocal immunomicroscopy cells were treated with LysoTracker Red, fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described for COS-7 cells and fibroblasts. Cells were stained with rabbit anti-sialidase antibodies and/or monoclonal anti-human CTLA-4 (CD152) antibodies (PharMingen, Mississauga, Ontario). Cells were counterstained with Cy3-conjugated affinity purified anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), or Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Oregon Green 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. A light mitochondrial fraction prepared from human liver homogenates was subjected to ultracentrifugation in a self-forming gradient of metrizamide (17Wattiaux R. Wattiaux-De Conninck S. Iodinated Density Gradient Media: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1983Google Scholar). A typical distribution was obtained for the marker enzymes for lysosomes, microsomes, and mitochondria. As expected, lysosomal marker enzymes were found in two major peaks, previously described as “light” (fractions 3–5) and “dense” (fractions 11–13) lysosomes (Fig. 1). Previous data have shown that light lysosomes are identical to late endosomes, i.e. mannose 6-phosphate receptor-positive organelles containing internal lipid vesicles and responsible in most cells for the majority of intracellular catabolism. Soluble lysosomal enzymes targeted by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-dependent pathway (i.e.β-galactosidase, N-acetyl β-hexosaminidase) were equally distributed between the light and dense lysosomes (Fig. 1). In contrast, lysosomal proteins, targeted to this organelle via clathrin-coated pits (i.e. LAMP-1, LAMP-2, β-glucosidase, and acid phosphatase) were present predominantly in the light pool of lysosomes (Fig. 1). Both measurement of sialidase activity (Fig. 1) and Western blotting of sialidase (not shown) demonstrated a distribution of sialidase between secondary endosomes and lysosomes similar to that of lysosomal membrane proteins which trafficking involves adaptor complexes. Other indications of the trafficking pattern of sialidase was obtained from comparative studies involving LAMP-2, which moves from the TGN to the lysosome via clathrin-coated pits. We examined targeting of sialidase and LAMP-2, when the normal pathway from the TGN to the lysosome, was perturbed by deficiency of an AP3 adaptor complex, as occurs in HPS, type 2. In the two patients with this genetic disorder of vesicle formation, the gene coding for the β-3A subunit of the heterotetrameric AP3 adaptor complex is mutated (16Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cells. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (574) Google Scholar), and the patients' fibroblasts exhibit drastically reduced levels of AP3. Consequently, trafficking of lysosomal membrane proteins such as CD63, LAMP-1, and LAMP-2 to the plasma membrane is enhanced. This apparently results in a default mechanism when the normal TGN to lysosome trafficking, which requires AP3 recognition of tyrosine-based signals on cargo proteins destined for the lysosome, is impaired (16Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Cells. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In any event, the AP3-deficient cells provide a model system in which LAMP-2 is misrouted to the plasma membrane, and in our experiments sialidase exhibited the same misrouting. In normal fibroblasts, both LAMP-2 and sialidase antibodies stained cytoplasmic perinuclear punctate structures which co-localized with lysosomal marker, LysoTracker Red dye (Fig. 2 A,NORM). In contrast, in AP3-deficient cells (Fig. 2 A, HPS-2) both antibodies showed mostly diffuse staining of the cell surface consistent with increased targeting of LAMP-2 and sialidase to the plasma membrane. In addition in AP3-deficient cells we detected the increased internalization of anti-sialidase antibodies (Fig.2 B) upon incubation of the cells with these antibodies for 15 min at 37 °C. Previously similar results with AP3-deficient cells were obtained with antibodies to CD63, LAMP-1, and LAMP-2 (16Dell'Angelica E.C. Shotelersuk V. Aguilar R.C. Gahl W.A. Bonifacino J.S. Mol.

Along with the results of cellular fractionation experiments, these data suggest that sialidase and LAMP-2 use the same mechanism for lysosomal targeting. The C-terminal tetrapeptide of sialidase, YGTL, resembles internalization signals previously identified in the cytoplasmic domains of several lysosomal membrane or endocytosed proteins.

Smad1 is one of the key signal transducers of BMPs and is responsible for transducing receptor activation signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where Smad1 serves as a transcriptional regulator of various BMP-responsive genes. Based upon the ability of Smad1 to bind multiple proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation pathway, we investigated whether Smad1 could be a substrate for proteasome. We found that Smad1 is targeted to proteasome for degradation in response to BMP type I receptor activation. The targeting of Smad1 to proteasome involves not only the receptor activation-induced Smad1 ubiquitination but also the targeting functions of the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme and the proteasome β subunit HsN3. Our studies provide the first evidence for BMP-induced proteasomal targeting and degradation of Smad1 and also reveal new players and novel mechanisms involved in this important aspect of Smad1 regulation and function.

The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) form a subfamily of the TGF-β superfamily and are key regulators of the morphogenesis and maintenance of multiple tissues and organs (1Kingsley D.M.

Each member of the TGF-β family ligands binds to a characteristic pair of type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, both of which are needed for signaling. The ligand first binds to the type II receptor, which then recruits and transphosphorylates a type I receptor-specific juxtamembrane motif, called the GS region, which is rich in serine and glycine (6Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 493-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The type I receptor is normally bound to a cytoplasmic inhibitor FKBP12, which is released upon a type II receptor-induced phosphorylation event different from GS motif phosphorylation (7Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Wang T. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T.

The phosphorylation of the GS motif and the release of the inhibitor FKBP12 together contribute to the activation of the type I receptor kinase activity. The activated type I receptor subsequently recruits and phosphorylates the intracellular target molecules, among which are the Smad family signal transducers (11Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar, 12Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

The Smad family proteins are a group of vertebrate proteins that exhibit high homology to the Drosophila Mad andCaenorhabditis elegans Smas, proteins first identified by genetic approaches to be signal transducers of TGF-β-like ligands in these invertebrate species (14Sekelsky J.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 790-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Based upon their structural and functional properties, Smads are divided into three subclasses: 1) receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), which are direct substrates of TGF-β family receptor kinases; 2) co-Smads, which participate in signaling by associating with R-Smads; and 3) anti-Smads, which act to inhibit the signaling functions of R-Smads. R-Smads interact transiently with specific ligand-activated type I receptors which directly phosphorylate the C-terminal SS(V/M)S motif of R-Smads. Smad2 and Smad3 are R-Smads specific for TGF-β and activin, whereas Smad1, -5, and -8 are R-Smads for BMPs (16Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad6 and Smad7 are known as anti-Smads or inhibitory Smads (17Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar), whereas Smad4 is the only known vertebrate co-Smad (18Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation at the SS(V/M)S motif, the R-Smad associates with Smad4, and then together they translocate into the nucleus. In the nucleus, Smads are known to act as transcriptional regulators (11Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar, 12Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

We have previously searched for protein interaction partners of Smad1 to better understand its signaling and regulation mechanisms in the signaling pathways of BMPs. We found that Smad1 binds to multiple proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation pathways such as HsN3, antizyme (Az), and ubiquitin. 2Y. Lin, J. Martin, C. Gruendler, J. Farley, X. Meng, B.-Y. Li, R. Lechleider, C. Huff, R. Kim, W. Grasser, V. Paralkar, and T. Wang, submitted for publication. HsN3 is one of the seven β subunits of the 20 S proteasome, the catalytic core of the 26 S proteasome (19Cruz M. Nandi D. Hendil K.B. Monaco J.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 190: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Kopp F. Kristensen P. Hendil K.B. Johnsen A. Sobek A. Dahlmann B. J. Mol.

HsN3 was also shown to be involved in the targeting of p105 NF-κB subunit to proteasome for processing (22Rousset R. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Nature. 1996; 381: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is well known for its role in covalently modifying proteasomal substrates for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (23Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 24Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

Az is a protein previously known to bind ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme for polyamine synthesis. Interestingly, its physical interaction with ODC is necessary and sufficient for targeting ODC to the 26 S proteasome for ubiquitin-independent degradation (26Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S.I. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7216-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Thus, ubiquitin and Az are two types of proteasome targeting proteins that mark proteins for both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Currently, it is not clear how proteasome recognizes ubiquitinated proteins or Az-bound ODC. The ability of Smad1 to bind to ubiquitin and Az as well as HsN3, which is a proteasome component, suggests an interesting link between Smad1 and the proteasome targeting events involving ubiquitin, Az and HsN3. Studies were carried out to test whether the physical interaction between Smad1 and proteins involved in proteasomal degradation pathways (HsN3, Az, and Ub) may lead to: 1) proteasomal degradation of Smad1 or 2) proteasomal degradation of Smad1 interacting proteins. Concomitant with our studies, recent studies by others in the field have demonstrated several important roles of proteasomal degradation in regulating the protein levels of Smads and Smad-interacting proteins (28Stroschein S.L.

In the signaling pathways of BMPs, it has been shown that Smad1 interacts with an ubiquitin E3 ligase, Smurf1, which regulates proteasomal degradation of Smad1 independent of BMP type I receptor activation (30Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence that proteasomal degradation of Smad1 is also induced upon the activation by the BMP type I receptor. Furthermore, our data reveal novel roles of two Smad1 interactors, Az and HsN3, in proteasomal targeting and degradation of Smad1, in addition to Smad1 ubiquitination. P19 cells (mouse teratocarcinoma cells) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% bovine calf serum and 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in presence of 5% CO2. 293 cells (human kidney cells transformed with adenovirus 5 DNA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 2 mmglutamine at 37 °C in presence of 5% CO2. For the 293 overexpression system, Smad1, HsN3, and antizyme were cloned into a modified pCMV6 vector that had the Flag epitope placed upstream of the multiple cloning site. The expression constructs for the wild-type BMP type I (ALK3) receptor, type II (bRII) receptor, and activated type I receptor (ALK3Q233D) were gifts from Dr. J. Massagué. The expression construct of R1 (rat homologue of ALK2) was made by polymerase chain reaction, followed by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction fragment of full-length R1 into pCMV6. R1K235R and R1Q207D were made by site-directed mutagenesis. FKBP12 has been described previously (8Wang T. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). HA-ubiquitin was a kind gift from Drs. M. Treies and D. Dohmann. Anti-Smad1 (367), a rabbit polyclonal antibody, was obtained from A. Roberts at NCI; anti-Smad1-P, a rabbit polyclonal antibody, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Lactacystin was purchased from E. J. Corey's laboratory at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA); Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde (MG-132) was purchased from Affinity Research;N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL) andN-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-l-methional (LLM) were purchased from Sigma. MG-132, LLnL, and LLM were made in Me2SO as a stock solution of 50 mm and then added directly into cell culture medium, to be diluted to a final concentration of 50 μm 8 h before cells were harvested for analyses. Lactacystin was made in H2O as a stock solution of 10 mm and added directly into cell culture medium, to be diluted to a final concentration of 25 μm. BMP7 was obtained from Creative Biomolecules Inc. (Hopkinton, MA); BMP2 and BMP4 were from the Genetics Institute Inc. For BMP treatment, the growth medium was changed to serum-free medium and then the stock solutions of BMP2, -4, or -7 were added directly into the cell culture medium to reach a final concentration of 400 ng/ml (for BMP2/4) and 250 ng/ml for BMP7. Putrescine and aminoguanidine were purchased from Sigma. Putrescine and aminoguanidine were made in H2O as a stock solution of 1m and then added directly into cell culture medium, to be diluted to a final putrescine concentration of 25 mm and an aminoguanidine concentration of 2.5 mm 8 h before cells were harvested for analyses. Equal amounts of plasmids were used to transfect 293 cells transiently with the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (36Ausubel F.M. Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Standard SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays were carried out to determine the expression levels of each transfected construct. For immunoprecipitation assays, cell lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 5 h or overnight in the presence of an antibody as indicated and 40 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose. Afterward the beads were washed once with lysis buffer, then three times with modified lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 instead of 1%). After spinning down and removing the supernatant, the Sepharose beads were mixed with 50 μl of 2× sample buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. The total elute was used for SDS-PAGE and Western blot. To assure that each group of cells have the same transfection efficiency, 293 cells were transfected as described above, pooled, and re-seeded the next day. Twenty-four hours after re-seeding, cells were washed twice in pulse-medium lacking [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% dialyzed serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin), and incubated for 15 min to deplete endogenous methionine. Cells were then incubated with the pulse-labeling medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (190 μCi/ml) for 2 h. After washing once with chase medium (pulse medium containing 150 mg/liter unlabeled methionine and cysteine), cells were then incubated with or without BMPs in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitors for different time periods before cells were harvested. Cells were then lysed using the lysis buffer described above. The obtained lysates were pre-cleaned with 50 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose for 1 h before the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation. The precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed for 30 min in 10% acetic acid and 10% methanol, followed by washing three times, each for 10 min in water. The gel was then incubated for 20 min in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), and then vacuum-dried at 75 °C. The radioactive signals were visualized by autoradiography using BioMax™ MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Cells were harvested as usual, then resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After incubation (shaking on ice) for 30 min, cells were sheared by aspirating 10 times through a 23-gauge needle syringe, centrifuged 2 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic proteins was kept on ice, and the pellet containing nuclear proteins was resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer B (same as buffer A except containing 420 mm NaCl instead of 10 mm KCl) for 30 min on ice with constant shaking. Both fractions were centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 ×g to obtain supernatants containing the cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions. When Smad1 was used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, the ornithine decarboxylase Az, two ubiquitin fusion proteins (Uba52 and Uba80), and the proteasome β subunit HsN3 were isolated as Smad1 interactors2 (37Guo X. Lin Y. Horbinski C. Drahushuk K.M. Kim I.-J. Kaplan P.L. Lein P. Wang T. Higgins D. J. Neuro. Biol. 2001; 48: 120-130Google Scholar). The interaction between Smad1 and HsN3 in the yeast two-hybrid system is dependent upon the presence of the MH2 domain of Smad1, as shown in Fig. 1 A. The MH2 domain of Smad1 is also required for Smad1 to bind Az (Fig.1 B, panel 1) as well as Ub fusion proteins (37Guo X. Lin Y. Horbinski C. Drahushuk K.M. Kim I.-J. Kaplan P.L. Lein P. Wang T. Higgins D. J. Neuro. Biol. 2001; 48: 120-130Google Scholar). Because HsN3 and Az are both Smad1 interactors, we further tested the interaction between these two proteins. Domain-specific interaction was detected between HsN3 and Az (Fig.1 B, panel 2). Az is known to bind ODC via the C-terminal domain of Az. The successful targeting of ODC by Az is dependent upon the N-terminal 107 amino acids (38Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 87-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Li X. Stebbins B. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4441-4446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The proteasomal receptor(s) for Az/ODC complex is not known, but has been suggested to involve components in both the 20 S proteasome as well as in the 19 S regulator (26Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Hayashi S.I. Tanahashi N. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7216-7227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Domain mapping analyses of the interaction between HsN3 and Az showed that the interaction requires the N-terminal 35 amino acids of HsN3 and the N-terminal 107 amino acids of Az, which overlaps with the known proteasome targeting signal on Az but is dispensable for ODC binding (Fig. 1 B, panels 2 and 3). A scheme is presented in Fig.1 C to illustrate the known domain-specific interaction between ODC and Az, as well as the newly observed interactions between Smad1, Az, and HsN3. Because HsN3 is a proteasome component, whereas Az and Ub are both substrate targeting proteins, the ability of Smad1 to interact with these proteins suggest that Smad1, like ODC, could be targeted to proteasome for degradation because of its ubiquitination or Az interaction, or could itself play a role in the substrate targeting process, such as in regulating the delivery of ubiquitinated protein or Az-bound proteins to proteasome. Although studies to test the ability of Smad1 in regulating the proteasomal targeting of an Az-bound nuclear protein are reported elsewhere,2 our studies of proteasomal degradation of Smad1 are described below. To explore a possible role of proteasome in degrading Smad1, we first tested the conditions required for the reduction of the steady state level of Smad1. Although increased expression of Az and HsN3 alone does not alter Smad1 level (data not shown), we observed a significant reduction of Smad1 level upon the activation of BMP type I receptor ALK3 (Fig. 2 A). In these studies, 293 cells were transfected with Flag-Smad1 alone or together with the constitutively active BMP type I receptor ALK3Q233D that mimics the effect of BMP stimulation (40Hoodless P.A. Haerry T. Abdollah S. Stapleton M. O'Connor M.B. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The protein level of Smad1 was monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 2 A,top panel). The detected Smad1 signals were then subjected to densitometry analyses, and the quantification results are presented as integrated optical density (IOD) of Flag-Smad1 (Fig.2 A, bottom panel). The IOD of Flag-Smad1 was reduced 68% upon ALK3Q233D coexpression. The ability of ALK3Q233D to phosphorylate Smad1 in this system was monitored by Western blot analysis with anti-Smad1-P, an antibody specific to the form of Smad1 phosphorylated at the C-terminal SSVS motif. As expected, ALK3Q233D expression led to Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A,middle panel). Thus, BMP type I receptor activation leads to both Smad1 phosphorylation at the C-terminal SSVS motif and a reduction of Smad1 protein level. These effects of the activated BMP type I receptor are dose-dependent, because increased expression of ALK3Q233D led to enhanced reduction of Smad1 protein level and enhanced increase of Smad1 phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). In this study, a constant amount of Smad1 expression construct was co-transfected with an increasing amount of ALK3Q233D into 293 cells. The change of Flag-Smad1 protein level in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus was monitored by separating the total proteins into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 2 B,top panel). The phosphorylated Smad1 protein level was detected by Western blot with anti-Smad1-P (Fig.2 B, bottom panel). To assist the analyses of Smad1 protein level changes, the IOD of Smad1 signals detected in the top panel of Fig. 2 Bwere quantified, corrected according to equal nonspecific signals in each lane, and plotted. As shown in Fig. 2 C, increased expression of ALK3Q233D led to a dose-dependent reduction of both cytoplasmic and nuclear Smad1 protein levels, although the reduction in the nuclear fraction was not as dramatic as that seen in the cytoplasmic fraction, possibly because of cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of Smad1. The IOD of phosphorylated Smad1 (Smad1-P) was also quantified. As shown in Fig. 2 D, transfecting 8 μg of ALK3Q233D construct significantly increased the level of Smad1-P, whereas transfecting 12 μg of ALK3Q233D construct did not lead to further increase of the level of Smad1-P. However, the relative percentage of Smad1-P over total Smad1 level exhibited a dose-dependent increase (Fig. 2 E). These data together indicate that increased receptor activation leads to an enhanced reduction of total Smad1 protein level, accompanying an increase in Smad1 phosphorylation. The above studies demonstrated the ability of a constitutively active BMP type I receptor (ALK3Q233D) to induce the reduction of Smad1 level in a dose-dependent fashion. We next examined the time course of the reduction of Smad1 protein level in response to BMP type I receptor activation. To do so, we reconstituted a BMP-responsive system in 293 cells by transiently transfecting the cells with BMP7-responsive type I receptor (R1) and the common BMP type II receptor (bRII) together with Flag-Smad1. Cells were treated with BMP7 for different time periods as indicated. Additionally, we transfected a second set of cells with the kinase-deficient mutant form of R1, R1K235R, which lacks the kinase activity as a result of the abolishment of its ATP binding site (41Macias-Silva M. Hoodless P.A. Tang S.J. Buchwald M. Wrana J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25628-25636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This serves as the control group to determine the role of the type I receptor kinase activity in the change of Smad1 phosphorylation and protein level upon receptor binding to BMP7. The protein levels of Smad1 and Smad1-P were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig.3 A). A time-dependent reduction of Smad1 steady state level was detected in R1/bRII-transfected cells but not in R1K235R/bRII group (Fig. 3 A, top panel, comparelanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8; IOD percentage shown in bottom panel). Thus, BMP7 induces the reduction of the steady state level of Smad1 in a time-dependent fashion, and the reduction is dependent upon the activation of the BMP type I receptor kinase activity. A similar experiment was carried out by replacing R1 with ALK3, which is the BMP2/4 type I receptor. A time-dependent reduction of Smad1 level was also observed (Fig. 3 B). Thus, BMP7, -2, and -4 can all induce time-dependent reduction of the steady state level of Smad1. We noted that Smad1 phosphorylation at its C-terminal SSVS motif was detected in R1/bRII transfected cells even before BMP7 treatment (Fig.3 A, middle panel, lane 1). These data suggest that R1 was constitutively activated independent of BMP7. In other words, the overexpressed R1 exhibited leaky signaling. Similar leakiness was also observed for ALK3 (see below). We also noted that Smad1 phosphorylation was induced by BMP7 in cells overexpressing the signaling defective R1K235R (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel, lanes 6–8). This appears to be caused by the presence of 293 cell endogenous BMP type I and type II receptors, whose activation by exogenous BMP7 led to the observed phosphorylation of Smad1 (data not shown). Although a time-dependent effect of BMPs on Smad1 protein level was detected in the above studies, we were concerned by the observed signaling leakiness of overexpressed R1. Because the immunophilin FKBP12 has been shown to play an important role in keeping the type I receptor inactive before ligand stimulation (7Wang T. Donahoe P.K. Zervos A.S. Science. 1994; 265: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Wang T. Li B.Y. Danielson P.D. Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we suspect that the lack of sufficient endogenous FKBP12 in 293 cells may contribute to the observed leaky signaling of the overexpressed type I receptors. Thus, we overexpressed FKBP12 together with the BMP type I receptor (ALK3) and the BMP type II receptor (bRII) in 293 cells, which were either treated with BMP4 or untreated. Smad1-P level was monitored by Western blot (Fig.3 C, top panel). A high level of Smad1-P was detected by simply coexpressing both the type I and type II receptors in the absence of any BMP4, indicating the leaky signaling of the overexpressed ALK3 (Fig. 3 C, top panel, lane 1). Upon the coexpression of FKBP12, Smad1 phosphorylation resulted from leaky signaling was greatly decreased (Fig. 3 C, top panel,lane 2) but was induced upon BMP4 treatment in the presence or absence of FKBP12 (Fig. 3 C, top panel, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, co-expression of FKBP12 reduces Smad1 phosphorylation resulted from leaky signaling from the overexpressed type I receptor but still allows an inducible phosphorylation of Smad1 by BMP4. The steady state level of Smad1 was also monitored by Western blot with anti-Flag (Fig. 3 C, second panel). Coincide with the ability of FKBP12 to inhibit leaky signaling-induced Smad1 phosphorylation, FKBP12 also restored the steady state level of Smad1 (Fig. 3 C, second panel, comparelanes 1 and 2). Coexpression of FKBP12 also allowed the detection of BMP4-induced reduction of the steady state level of Smad1 (Fig. 3 C, second panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). The absence of FKBP12 allowed a further reduction of Flag-Smad1 signal (second panel, lane 4). Therefore, FKBP12 blocks leaky signaling-induced Smad1 phosphorylation and the reduction of Smad1 protein level. After solving the problem of receptor leakiness of ALK3 in the overexpression system,"

Although these lesions are repaired by the base excision repair pathway, they have been shown also to be subject to transcription-coupled repair. A current model for transcription-coupled repair proposes that RNA polymerase II arrested at a DNA lesion provides a signal for recruitment of the repair enzymes to the lesion site. Here we report the effect of thymine glycol on transcription elongation by T7 RNA polymerase and RNA polymerase II from rat liver. DNA substrates containing a single thymine glycol located either in the transcribed or nontranscribed strand were used to carry out in vitro transcription. We found that thymine glycol in the transcribed strand blocked transcription elongation by T7 RNA polymerase ∼50% of the time but did not block RNA polymerase II. Thymine glycol in the nontranscribed strand did not affect transcription by either polymerase. These results suggest that arrest of RNA polymerase elongation by thymine glycol is not necessary for transcription-coupled repair of this lesion. Additional factors that recognize and bind thymine glycol in DNA may be required to ensure RNA polymerase arrest and the initiation of transcription-coupled repairin vivo.

TCR was originally observed for lesions repaired by nucleotide excision repair (2Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). An active RNA polymerase elongation complex is necessary for preferential repair of the transcribed strand (7Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The arrest of transcription at DNA lesions has been proposed to serve as a specific signal to direct repair enzymes to the transcribed strand of an active gene to initiate a repair event (8Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). It is likely that this repair pathway evolved for the dedicated purpose of resolving the impasse of an RNA polymerase arrested at a lesion. The polymerase must be displaced both to permit verification that a lesion caused the arrest and to allow the repair enzymes to operate on the lesion (1Hanawalt P.C. Science. 1994; 266: 1957-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The role of RNA polymerases in TCR has been examined more directly by comparing the extent of RNA polymerase arrest in vitro by a lesion with TCR of that lesion in vivo. These studies have shown that various types of DNA damage in the template strand of DNA can act as blocks to transcription catalyzed by different RNA polymerases. In several cases, a correlation between the extent of polymerase arrest and the extent of TCR has been found (7Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, most of these studies have been carried out using viral and bacterial RNA polymerases. In an attempt to understand the role of mammalian RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in TCR, we have developed an in vitro transcription system with templates containing a site-specific lesion positioned downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) and purified proteins and initiation factors. Using this in vitro transcription system, we have previously shown that a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer in the transcribed strand in different sequence contexts is a strong block to RNAP II (9Donahue B.A. Yin S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31719-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The arrested polymerase is stable and competent to resume transcription. Furthermore, the arrested complex can be displaced from the lesion site during transcript cleavage mediated by elongation factor SII to allow access of a small repair enzyme, photolyase, to the lesion site for repair (11Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results support the original TCR model in which RNAP II must be displaced from the site of the lesion to provide access for repair enzymes to the lesion site (8Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A.

In this study, we have analyzed the effect of thymine glycol (Tg) on transcription elongation. Tgs are formed by oxidation of the 5,6 double bond of thymine on exposure to ionizing radiation or oxidative stress. Tg is a strong blocking lesion for prokaryotic DNA polymerases in vitro (13Ide H.

Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been recently shown that Tg in human cells is also subject to TCR (22Leadon S.A. Barbie S.L. Dunn A.B. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Cooper P. Nouspikel T. Clarkson S.G. Leadon S.

Cell. 2000; 101: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This represents the first example of an evident coupling of base excision repair to transcription, raising the question of how the RNAP II may react to a thymine glycol compared with a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer in the transcribed strand. To study the effect of Tg on transcription, we have prepared DNA substrates containing a single Tg positioned downstream of the T7 promoter or the AdMLP in the transcribed or nontranscribed strand and an in vitro transcription system with purified RNA polymerase and initiation factors. We have found that a Tg located on the transcribed strand is a significant block to T7 RNAP, resulting in polymerase arrest 50% of the time. Surprisingly, and in contrast, a Tg in the transcribed strand has no detectable effect on transcription by RNAP II, suggesting that additional factors that bind to this lesion in the DNA may be involved in RNAP II arrest and initiation of TCRin vivo. T7 RNAP was purchased from New England Biolabs. RNAP II and transcription initiation factors were purified from rat liver or recombinant sources as described previously (25Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11238-11244Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase were from Life Technologies, Inc. E. coli strain MV1184 was a gift from Dr. Joachim Messing (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). D44 IgG anti-RNA antibodies (27Eilat D. Hochberg M. Fischel R. Laskov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3818-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were purified from ascites fluid as described previously (26Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified NTPs and radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Formalin-fixedStaphylococcus aureus was obtained from Calbiochem. A 13-mer oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-CCCCGCGTACCGG-3′, containing a single Tg, was prepared by oxidation with osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in the presence of pyridine (16Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 200 μg of the oligonucleotide, 3% OsO4, and 5% pyridine in a final volume of a 100 μl. Oxidation was carried out at room temperature for 1 h, after which excess OsO4 was extracted with ether. The 13-mer oligonucleotide containing a single Tg was purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Beckman System Gold Nouveau apparatus consisting of an autosampler, a dual pump module, a UV absorbance detector (set to read at 254 nm), and a Hamilton PRP-1 reverse-phase column. Gradient control and data processing were achieved using Beckman System Gold Nouveau software. Optimal separation of the oxidized product was obtained using 0.1 mammonium acetate, pH 5.8, with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–30% over 30 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. (Ref. 28Basu A.K. Loechler E.L. Leadon S. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7677-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and see Fig.2). The presence of a Tg was confirmed by piperidine cleavage of the phosphodiester bond adjacent to the modified base (16Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and by enzymatic digestion of the OsO4-treated 13-mer oligonucleotide to deoxynucleosides followed by HPLC (29Kao J.Y. Goljer I. Phan T.A. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17787-17793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter treatment revealed the anticipated amounts of dA, dG, and dC, but no detectable dT. As expected, dTg was undetectable because of its weak UV absorbance. DNA templates used for transcription reactions with T7 RNAP consisted of 154-base pair (bp) DNA fragments containing a single Tg in the transcribed (TgTST7) or nontranscribed (TgNTST7) strand downstream of the T7 promoter and of a C-less cassette (Fig. 1 A). The C-less cassette resulted in a short stretch of RNA devoid of C. These substrates were constructed from eight oligonucleotides, five in the damage-containing strand and three in the opposite strand (Ref. 30Shi Y.-b. Gamper H. Hearst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 527-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). 50 pmol of each oligonucleotide were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The mixture was heated 3 min at 95 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature. ATP to a final concentration of 1 mm and 10 units of T4 DNA ligase were added to the mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm polyethylene glycol-8000. The DNA was ligated overnight at 16 °C. The ligation products were treated with proteinase K and further purified by ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were resuspended in formamide dye, and the single-stranded 154-bp DNA fragments were purified from an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To ensure that all samples were double-stranded after reannealing of the complementary strands, the DNA was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and further purified on a nondenaturing gel if necessary. DNA templates used for transcription reactions with RNAP II consisted of HindIII-linearized plasmid DNA containing a single Tg downstream of the AdMLP and of a G-less cassette (Fig. 1 B). The G-less cassette resulted in a short stretch of RNA devoid of G. To construct plasmids to receive Tg-adducted oligonucleotides, an 18-mer oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-GATCCCCCGGTACGCGGG-3′ was annealed to the complementary strand and ligated into the BamHI site of pUCH2 (11Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in one orientation to yield pUCTg-TS and in the opposite orientation to yield pUCTg-NTS. pUCTg-TS and pUCTg-NTS were transformed into the F′ E. coli strain MV1184 to produce single-stranded DNA for primer extension as described (11Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Covalently closed circular DNA containing a single Tg on the transcribed or nontranscribed strand was generated by priming 10 μg of plus strand of pUCTg-TS or pUCTg-NTS with a 5-fold molar excess of Tg-containing oligonucleotide phosphorylated at the 5′ end in a 300-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 600 μm dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP, 1 mm ATP, 30 units of T4 DNA polymerase, and 5 units of T4 DNA ligase. Covalently closed circular molecules were purified from an agarose gel containing 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Under these conditions, covalently closed circular DNA migrates as supercoiled DNA and can be resolved from single-stranded closed circular and nicked double-stranded plasmids. Closed circular DNA molecules were resistant to RsaI, indicating that 100% contained a Tg (data not shown). DNA templates were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a 10-μl mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP, 100 μm A, 212 units of RNAsin, and 50 units of T7 RNAP. Elongation proceeds until T7 RNAP reaches the end of the C-less cassette (nucleotide 7), at which the first UTP is required for incorporation. Heparin was added to prevent further initiation, and then 100 μm ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP was added to allow elongation to continue, typically for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with SDS and proteinase K, and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. Samples were resuspended in formamide loading dye, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 8.3 m urea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. Transcripts were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. All transcripts were labeled up to nucleotide 7 (C-less cassette; Fig. 1), making quantitation independent of their length and G content. DNA templates were incubated for 30 min at 28 °C with rat liver protein fraction D (2 μg, containing TFIID and TFIIH) and rat liver RNAP II (0.5 μg) in a 20-μl mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2.2 mm polyvinylalcohol, 212 units of RNasin, 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 3% glycerol. After incubation, 33 μl of a solution containing fraction B′ (1 μg, containing TFIIF and TFIIE) and recombinant rat TFIIB (3 ng) in the same buffer without KCl were added, and incubation continued for 20 min at 28 °C to form preinitiation complexes. 7 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 20 μm UTP, and 40 μCi of [α-32P]CTP were added, and incubation continued for 20 min. Elongation proceeded until RNAP II reached the end of the C-less cassette (nucleotide 15), at which the first GTP was required for incorporation. Heparin was added to prevent further initiation, and then 800 μm ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP was added to allow elongation to continue, typically for 15 min. Elongation complexes were immunoprecipitated with D44 anti-RNA antibodies and formalin-fixed S. aureus and then washed three times in reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 2.2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol. Washed complexes were resuspended in 60 μl of reaction buffer for further treatment. Reactions were stopped with SDS and proteinase K, and nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. Samples were resuspended in formamide loading dye, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate-EDTA with 8.3 m urea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. Oxidation of a 13-mer oligonucleotide with OsO4 in the presence of pyridine (16Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) yielded one major peak (retention time, 8.37 min), as detected by reverse-phase HPLC (Ref. 28Basu A.K. Loechler E.L. Leadon S. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7677-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and Fig.2 B), that was completely shifted from the position of the undamaged Tg13 oligonucleotide (retention time, 9.34 min; Fig. 2 A). Fractions were collected at 20-s intervals and further analyzed by HPLC; those containing only the oxidized product were pooled to generate ∼20 μg of pure Tg-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 C). The presence of a TG in the purified oligonucleotide was confirmed by HPLC analysis of enzymatic hydrolysates (29Kao J.Y. Goljer I. Phan T.A. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17787-17793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by piperidine cleavage of the TG-containing oligonucleotide (Ref. 16Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and data not shown). The Tg-containing oligonucleotide was used to construct DNA substrates for T7 and RNAP II transcription. The 154-mer DNA substrate used for T7 RNAP transcription was obtained by hybridization and ligation of eight oligonucleotides, five in the damage-containing strand and three in the complementary strand (Fig. 1 A; see “Experimental Procedures”). A single Tg was positioned in the transcribed or nontranscribed strand 52 bp downstream of the T7 promoter. The substrate used for RNAP II transcription consisted of an HindIII-linearized plasmid obtained by primer extension, using the Tg-containing oligonucleotide as primer (see “Experimental Procedures”). A single Tg in the transcribed or nontranscribed strand was positioned 167 bp downstream of the AdMLP (Fig. 1 B) to ensure that RNAP II complexes had completed any transitions out of the initiation state before encountering a Tg (31Samkurashvili I. Luse D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23495-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presence of a single Tg in the T7 and RNAP II DNA templates was confirmed by resistance to cleavage byRsaI restriction enzyme and by E. coliendonuclease III digestion (data not shown). To analyze the behavior of T7 RNAP and RNAP II when they encounter a Tg, single round transcription experiments were carried out. In these experiments, each template molecule is transcribed only once by a single molecule of RNA polymerase so that the transcription products represent a single promoter-dependent elongation event (32Viswanathan A. Doetsch P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21276-21281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). T7 RNAP and RNAP II were stalled downstream of the T7 promoter or AdMLP, respectively, after synthesis of a short 32P-labeled RNA, followed by addition of heparin to prevent further initiation. Then NTPs were added to allow elongation to continue. When a Tg was located in the transcribed strand, T7 RNAP transcription produced a significant proportion of transcripts shorter then the full-length RNA present in the control (Fig. 3, lanes 2and 3). Comparison of the size of these transcripts with those obtained from an RsaI-digested undamaged substrate indicated that these RNAs were extended up to and one nucleotide past the site of the Tg (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). A small fraction of transcripts arrested around the lesion was also observed. These transcripts were likely the product of nucleotide addition or loss by T7 RNAP (33Jacques J. Kolakofsky D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A Tg located in the nontranscribed strand was not a block to T7 RNAP, as shown by the generation of full-length runoff transcripts (Fig. 3, lane 6). To determine whether the rate of synthesis of the full-length and truncated transcripts would vary with time, we monitored the amounts of transcripts generated from 0 to 5 min after the start of the elongation phase. The undamaged control templates produced a full-length runoff product as expected (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–7), which increased as a function of time. On the other hand, transcription of the Tg-containing template (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8–13) resulted in the synthesis of transcripts stalled at the lesion and full-length runoff transcripts, with a read-through frequency up to 50% (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Time course of T7 RNAP transcription of templates containing a single Tg.

In this system, repair of the lesion cannot occur because of the lack of repair proteins. Surprisingly, in contrast with the results obtained with T7 RNAP, the presence of a Tg in the transcribed strand did not affect RNAP II transcription, as indicated by the generation of a full-length runoff product (Fig.5, lane 3). Tg bypass was also observed when transcription of Tg-containing substrates was carried out for shorter times (data not shown), indicating that a Tg was not even a temporary block to RNAP II elongation. The presence of a Tg in the nontranscribed strand also did not affect transcription by RNAP II (Fig. 5, lane 5). We have studied the effect of Tg on transcription elongation by T7 RNAP and mammalian RNAP II using an in vitro assay with DNA substrates containing a single Tg in the transcribed or nontranscribed strand located downstream of the T7 promoter or the AdMLP and purified proteins to carry out transcription. We have found that a Tg in the transcribed strand of template DNA was a significant block to the progression of T7 RNAP, in general agreement with the results of others (34Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Htun H. Johnston B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 272-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), resulting in polymerase arrest 50% of the time. Surprisingly, a Tg in the transcribed strand was efficiently bypassed by RNAP II. A Tg in the nontranscribed strand was bypassed by both polymerases. The ability of a Tg to block transcription by T7 RNAP is similar to the effect of this lesion on in vitro DNA synthesis by prokaryotic DNA polymerases (13Ide H. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8035-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 14Rouet P. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 45: 6113-6118Google Scholar, 15Hayes R.C. LeClerc J.E.

These studies have shown that the extent of DNA polymerase blockage at a Tg is modulated by the sequence context of the lesion (15Hayes R.C. LeClerc J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1045-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Purmal A.A. Lampman G.W. Bond J.P. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10026-10035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Lesion bypass by E. coli DNA polymerase I has been observed at 5′-C-Tg-pur-3′ and at 5′-C-Tg-C-3′, suggesting that both nucleotides 5′ and 3′ to the Tg influence the ability of the polymerase to bypass the lesion (15Hayes R.C. LeClerc J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1045-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when a Tg is located in the same sequence context we have analyzed, 5′-G-Tg-T-3′, it can be bypassed, although at low frequency, by E. coli DNA polymerase Klenow fragment lacking proofreading activity (20Purmal A.A. Lampman G.W. Bond J.P. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10026-10035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is likely that sequence context effects may also modulate the efficiency of T7 RNAP transcription arrest by Tg, and this could explain the different extent of transcription blockage we observed compared with the 100% blockage reported by Hatahet et al. (34Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 726: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The structural modification of DNA caused by the presence of a Tg in the double helix may explain how T7 RNAP arrest at this lesion occurs. NMR studies on Tg-containing oligonucleotides indicate that the presence of a Tg in the double helix induces a significant and highly localized alteration in the structure of the DNA, with the Tg and the complementary base being extrahelical (29Kao J.Y. Goljer I. Phan T.A. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17787-17793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9227-9236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); these structural perturbations are likely to affect DNA-protein interactions. Molecular modeling studies have revealed that, although Tg stabilizes interactions with the base pair 3′ to the lesion, the stacking interactions between Tg and the base pair 5′ to the lesion are considerably destabilized. This is attributable to an unfavorable steric overlap between the base 5′ to the lesion and the methyl group of Tg, which in turn results in a significant increase of the tilt angle of the base 5′ to the Tg. The structural perturbation caused by Tg in DNA has been proposed to result in a reduced rate of base insertion beyond Tg and, as a consequence, to DNA polymerase blockage by this lesion. This effect is modulated by the sequence context surrounding the lesion (37Clark J.M. Pattabiraman N. Jarvis W. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5404-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similarly, the presence of a Tg in the DNA may affect the formation and stability of the RNA·DNA hybrid, an essential component of the elongation complex necessary to maintain the RNA 3′ terminus in contact with the active site of RNAP (38Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sidorenkov I. Komissarova N. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This effect may shift the kinetic competition between incorporation of the next nucleotide and decay into the inactive state toward transcription arrest (40von Hippel P.H. Science. 1998; 281: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Our finding that a Tg does not cause RNAP II arrest but rather allows for efficient bypass raises the question of how the initiation of TCR of Tg occurs. A current TCR model proposes that RNAP II arrest at a lesion represents a signal to recruit the repair enzymes to the lesion site to initiate a repair event. This model predicts that lesions that block RNAP II transcription will be subject to TCR. Consistent with this model, a correlation between transcription arrest by a lesionin vitro and TCR of the lesion in vivo has been found in most cases analyzed (7Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are subject to TCR and are also absolute blocks to elongation by RNAP II (9Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 10Tornaletti S. Donahue B.A. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31719-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ternary complex is stable (9Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and it can resume elongation past the thymines after reversal of the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer by photoreactivation (11Tornaletti S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24124-24130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, acetylaminofluorene is not repaired by TCR, consistent with the instability of the RNAP II ternary complex arrested at this lesion (41Donahue B.A. Fuchs R.P. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10588-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Some clues to this question come from studies carried out on 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), another oxidative lesion that has been shown to be repaired in a transcription-coupled manner (24Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Similar to our results, 8-oxoG has been shown to partially block transcription by T7 RNAP (33Jacques J. Kolakofsky D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but to be completely bypassed by E. coli RNAPin vitro (32Viswanathan A. Doetsch P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21276-21281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that this lesion may not block RNAP II transcription. However, the presence of a single 8-oxoG in a shuttle vector downstream of the SV40 promoter impedes transcription by RNAP II in human cells (24Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It was speculated that 8-oxoG does not block RNAP II directly but rather through binding of a protein to the lesion. In support of this hypothesis, it was found that the activity of purified human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase on an 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide in vitro was inhibited by addition of whole cell extract, suggesting the existence of an 8-oxoG binding protein in human cells (42Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Maidt L. Floyd R.A. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It is possible that similar to the putative mechanism of initiation of TCR of 8-oxoG, additional factors that bind to a Tg may be required to ensure RNAP II arrest at Tg and consequent initiation of TCR.

Using reporter gene assays, several investigators showed that EVI1 is a transcription repressor, and recently it was shown that EVI1 interacts with the co-repressor carboxyl-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1). Earlier, we showed that the inappropriate expression of EVI1 in murine hematopoietic precursor cells leads to their abnormal differentiation and to increased proliferation. Using biochemical assays, we have identified two groups of transcription co-regulators that associate with EVI1 presumably to regulate gene expression. One group of co-regulators includes the CtBP1 and histone deacetylase. The second group includes the two co-activators cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF), both of which have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. All of these proteins require separate regions of EVI1 for efficient interaction, and they divergently affect the ability of EVI1 to regulate gene transcription in reporter gene assays. Confocal microscopy analysis shows that in the majority of the cells, EVI1 is nuclear and diffused, whereas in about 10% of the cells EVI1 localizes in nuclear speckles. However, in the presence of the added exogenous co-repressors histone deacetylase or CtBP1, all of the nuclei have a diffuse EVI1 staining, and the proteins do not appear to reside together in obvious nuclear structures. In contrast, when CBP or P/CAF are added, defined speckled bodies appear in the nucleus. Analysis of the staining pattern indicates that EVI1 and CBP or EVI1 and P/CAF are contained within these structures. These nuclear structures are not observed when CBP is substituted with a point mutant HAT-inactive CBP with which EVI1 also physically interacts. Finally, we show that the interaction of EVI1 with either CBP or P/CAF leads to acetylation of EVI1. These results suggest that the assembly of EVI1 in nuclear speckles requires the intact HAT activity of the co-activators.

The gene is highly conserved through evolution and encodes a transcription repressor characterized by two DNA-binding zinc finger domains (2Morshita K. Parkar D.S. Mucenski M.L. Copeland N.G.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). During murine embryogenesis, the gene is expressed in several organs, and homozygous disruption of EVI1 by gene targeting leads to embryonic death caused by severe malformation and defects in almost all of the developing organs (4Hoyt P.R.

After birth and in the adult organism, EVI1 is detected in several organs but not in normal hematopoietic organs including bone marrow (5Perkins A.S. Mercer J.A. Mucenski M.L. Development. 1991; III: 479-487Google Scholar). The forced expression of EVI1 in cell lines and in murine embryonic stem cells reduces the cellular response to growth inhibition by transforming growth factor-β (6Kurokawa M. Mitani K. Irie K.

Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1639-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the inappropriate expression of EVI1 in cell lines leads to up-regulation of cell replication (7Sitailo S. Sood R. Barton K. Nucifora G. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1639-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which EVI1 disrupts normal cell replication and hematopoietic differentiation are not known, but it was suggested that they could be related to the ability of this protein to function as a transcription repressor (10Kreider B.L.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that EVI1 interacts specifically with the co-repressor carboxyl-terminal binding protein (CtBP)1 in yeast (12Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and in mammalian cells (13Izutsu K. Kurokawa M. Imai Y. Maki K. Mitani K. Hirai H.

The inappropriate expression of EVI1 in hematopoietic cells has been associated with very aggressive chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mouse and in man (15Fontenay-Roupie M. Bouscary D. Melle J. Vigue F. Picard F. Guesnv M. Dreyfus F. Hematol. Cell Ther. 1997; 39: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Russel M. Thaompson F. Spier C. Taetle R. Leukemia. 1993; 7: 1654-1657PubMed Google Scholar). In man, the inappropriate expression of EVI1 is triggered by chromosomal rearrangements that disrupt the 3q26 chromosomal region where the gene is located (17Fichelson S. Dreyfus F. Berger R. Melle J. Bastard C. Miclea J.M. Gisselbrecht S. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 93-96PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jenkins R.B. Tefferi A. Solberg Jr., L.A. Dewald G.W. Cancer Genet.

The most frequent rearrangements are the t(3;3)(q21;q26) and the inv(3)(q21q26) associated with very aggressive AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (19Morshita K. Parganas E. Willman C.L. Whittaker M.H.

The inappropriate activation of EVI1 occurs also by unknown mechanisms, and chronic myelogenous leukemia patients frequently display EVI1 up-regulation, although their chromosome 3 appear normal by conventional cytogenetics.Many oncoproteins involved in leukemia are activated and modified by chromosomal translocations. It is suggested that the altered oncoproteins acquire the ability to recruit transcription co-repressors (Sin3, CtBP, SMRT, and N-CoR) to promoters of genes that regulate cell cycle or hematopoietic differentiation, presumably leading to reconfiguration of the chromatin architecture and inappropriate gene regulation. Indeed, several investigators have shown that nuclear proteins such as AML1/ETO, PML/RARα, and TEL/AML1 interact with members of the co-repressor family (21Minucci S. Maccarana M. Cioce M. De Luca P. Gelmetti V. et al.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 811-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 22Lin R.J. Evans R.M. Mol.

Commun. 1999; 264: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, some co-activators that are expressed in most tissues, such as the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and its homolog p300, are also involved in neoplastic transformation of cells following chromosomal translocations (24Sobulo O.M. Borrow J. Tomek R. Reshmi S. Harden A. Schlegelberger B. Housman D. Doggett N.A. Rowley J.D. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 1996; 14: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). These and other co-activators, such as the p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF), are pleiotropic co-factors that often have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. These enzymes regulate cell growth and differentiation in several systems including the hematopoietic system.In this report we have analyzed the ability of EVI1 to interact with both co-repressors and co-activators. We have found that EVI1 interacts with both classes (class I and class II) of histone deacetylases (HDACs), and we confirm that it interacts with CtBP1. The interaction with CtBP1 or HDACs requires distinct nonoverlapping domains of EVI1 separated by ∼500 amino acids. In addition, we found that EVI1 also specifically interacts in vivo with CBP and P/CAF through distinct nonoverlapping domains and that EVI1 is acetylated by CBP and P/CAF. The interaction with these co-regulators is specific and results in the opposite response of a reporter gene in vitro. By confocal microscopy analysis, we find that EVI1 is assembled in nuclear speckles in less than 10% of the cells. The addition of CtBP1 and HDAC1 abrogates the ability of EVI1 to be assembled in nuclear speckles, whereas the addition of CBP or P/CAF results in nuclear speckles that contain EVI1 and CBP or EVI1 and P/CAF. Finally, we have also determined that the region of EVI1 including the CtBP1-binding domain is required for up-regulation of the cell cycle in 32Dcl3 cells.RESULTSEVI1 Interacts with CtBP1 in Mammalian CellsTo identify potential co-repressors that interact with EVI1, we performed the yeast two-hybrid analysis using full-length EVI1, the two domains of zinc fingers, or the central domain of the protein. However, the assays showed that the entire protein and the selected segments act as portable activation domains in yeast and therefore they could not be used for this study (data not shown). We therefore used targeted co-IP strategy. To confirm that EVI1 interacts with CtBP1, we used co-IP analysis with several deletion mutants and point mutants shown in Fig.1. After transient transfection, the proteins were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody and were separated by electrophoresis. Full-length or mutant EVI1 proteins were visualized with EVI1 antiserum. The results confirmed that full-length EVI1 physically interacts with CtBP1 (Fig.2 A, top panel,lanes 1 and 5). To identify the region necessary for CtBP1 interaction, we used the deletion mutants EVI1–736 and EVI1–546. The results show that whereas EVI1–736 interacts with CtBP1 (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lanes 2 and6), the mutant EVI1–546 is unable to interact with CtBP1 (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lanes 3 and7). Thus, the 190-amino acid region upstream of the second set of zinc finger is necessary for the interaction between EVI1 and CtBP1. The expression of the transfected FLAG-CtBP1 was confirmed by stripping the blot and reprobing the blot with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig.2 A, bottom panel, lanes 5–7). Within this stretch of 190 amino acids, EVI1 contains a PLDLS CtBP1-binding consensus (amino acids 584–588) and a variation of this motif, PFDLT (amino acids 553–557). To determine whether both sites are necessary for interaction with CtBP1, we generated EVI1 point mutants in which either the first consensus sequence was mutated from PFDLT to PFAST (mutant A; Fig. 1) or the second consensus was mutated from PLDLS to PLASS (mutant B; Fig. 1). In addition, a double mutant with mutations of both sites (mutant C; Fig. 1) was generated. Each one of the point mutants was expressed at a high level in transiently transfected Cos-7 cells (Fig. 2 B, top panel, lanes 7–9). Co-IP analysis indicated that mutation at the PFDLT site impaired the interaction as shown by the faint IP band (Fig.2 B, top panel, lane 2). However, mutation of the PLDLS site almost completely abrogated the interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 2 B, top panel,lane 3). Mutation of both sites eliminates the interaction between EVI1 and CtBP1 (Fig. 2 B, top panel,lane 4). Expression of transfected FLAG-CtBP1 was confirmed by stripping the blot and reprobing the blot with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel, lanes 6–9). These results confirm those recently reported by other investigators on the interaction between CtBP1 and EVI1 (13Izutsu K. Kurokawa M. Imai Y. Maki K. Mitani K. Hirai H.

Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 33Wade P. Human Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether EVI1 associates with HDAC enzymes, we used co-IP analysis of cells transiently transfected with EVI1 and either HDAC1 (class I) or HDAC4–6 (class II). The proteins were precipitated with monoclonal FLAG antibody (for FLAG-tagged HDACs), separated on gel, and analyzed with antiserum to EVI1. The results indicate that EVI1 is able to interact with members of both classes of HDACs; however, the strongest interaction was observed for HDAC1 and HDAC4 (Fig.3, top panels, lanes 1 and 5). To identify the region of EVI1 that is required for the interaction with the HDACs, we used the EVI1 deletion mutants EVI1–736 (Fig. 3, top panels, lanes 2and 6) and EVI1–269, which contains only the proximal domain of zinc fingers (Fig. 3, top panels, lanes 3 and 7). We found that the shortest EVI1 mutant is still capable of interacting with HDAC1 and HDAC4, indicating that the interaction occurs through the proximal domain of EVI1 zinc fingers. Thus, it appears that EVI1 contains two regions that interact separately with CtBP1 and HDAC and that CtBP1 bound to EVI1 is not the most efficient or major site for recruitment of an HDAC enzyme. To confirm the expression of transfected FLAG-HDAC1 and FLAG-HDAC4, the blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG antibody. The results (Fig. 3, bottom panels, lanes 5–7) indicate that both proteins were expressed in the transfected cells.Figure 3The proximal zinc finger domain of EVI1 physically interacts with HDAC1 and HDAC4. The cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-HDAC1 or HDAC4 and one of the plasmids encoding full-length or mutant EVI1.

The immunoprecipitated full-length or mutant EVI1 proteins were visualized with EVI1 antiserum. HDAC1 (A) and HDAC4 (B) interact with full-length EVI1 (lanes 1 and 5) and with the deletion mutants EVI1–736 (lanes 2 and6) and EVI1–269 (lanes 3 and 7). As shown in Fig. 1, the mutant EVI1–269 contains only the proximal zinc finger domain. No co-IP band is observed with proteins extracted from nontransfected cells (lanes 4 and 8).

CBP/p300 and P/CAF are co-regulators that have been implicated in neoplastic transformation (24Sobulo O.M. Borrow J. Tomek R. Reshmi S. Harden A. Schlegelberger B. Housman D. Doggett N.A. Rowley J.D.

Civin C.J. Disteche C. Dube I. Frischauf A.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). To determine whether EVI1 physically interacts with CBP, we used co-IP analysis of proteins after co-transfection of 293T cells with HA-CBP and either the full-length or deletion mutants of FLAG-tagged EVI1. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with commercial antibody that recognizes the amino terminus of CBP. The precipitated proteins were separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and probed with anti-EVI1 antiserum. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins showed that EVI1 interacts very strongly with CBP (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lanes 1 and 6). The deletion mutants EVI1–653 (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lanes 2and 7) and EVI1–514 (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lanes 3 and 8) are still capable of interaction with CBP. However, the deletion mutant EVI1–283 does not interact with CBP. Thus, the interaction between EVI1 and CBP requires the EVI1 region between amino acids 283 and 514 (Fig. 4 A,top panel, compare lanes 3 and 4). A point mutant variant of CBP that has no HAT activity interacts with EVI1 as the wild type CBP, indicating that the HAT activity is not required for interaction (data not shown). It is well known that CBP is often found associated with P/CAF and several other proteins in large co-activator complexes. To determine whether the interaction of EVI1 with CBP could lead to the recruitment of P/CAF, we used co-IP assays of transiently transfected cells and Western blot analysis. The cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding full-length or mutant EVI1 proteins and with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged P/CAF. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, separated by electrophoresis, and identified by EVI1 antiserum. The results (Fig.4 B, top panel) show that EVI1 interacts with P/CAF. Co-IP assays and Western blot analyses with EVI1 deletion mutants show that the interaction requires the short deletion mutant EVI1–283 (Fig. 4 B, top panel, lanes 2and 5) and indicate that the interaction occurs through the proximal zinc finger domain of EVI1. Thus, the regions of EVI1 necessary for interaction with CBP and P/CAF are separate and nonoverlapping. The expression of CBP and P/CAF in the transiently transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the stripped membranes (Fig. 4, bottom panels).Figure 4EVI1 interacts with CBP and P/CAF.A, interaction with CBP. 293T cells were transiently co-transfected with CBP and either full-length EVI1 (lanes 1and 6) or the deletion mutants EVI1–653 (lanes 2and 7), EVI1–514 (lanes 3 and 8), or EVI1–283 (lanes 4 and 9). After 48 h, the protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-CBP antibody, and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitated full-length or mutant EVI1 proteins were visualized with EVI1 antiserum. The deletion of the region between amino acids 283 and 514 abrogates the interaction with CBP. Lanes 5 and10 show the assays with nontransfected cells.

We used the pTAK-CAT promoter in the presence or absence of added CtBP1. It was shown that EVI1 binds directly to this promoter and that this promoter is repressed by EVI1 (10Kreider B.L. Orkin S.H. Ihle J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6454-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In our assays we consistently find that EVI1 represses this promoter to about 60–70% of its normal activity (Fig. 5, bars 1 and2). In the presence of added CtBP1, the activity of the promoter was further reduced by EVI1 from 60% to about 45% (Fig. 5,bars 2 and 5). However, when the EVI1 mutant C (unable to interact with CtBP1) was used, the normal activity of the promoter was reduced to only about 80% and did not significantly change in the presence of added CtBP1 (Fig. 5, bars 3 and6). In parallel, we used the same assays to observe the effect of HDAC1. However, we did not detect any further repression by the addition of exogenous HDAC1 (data not shown). Because the HDAC enzymes are abundant in the cell (in contrast to CtBP1 which is limiting in the cell), it is possible that the endogenous level of the combined two classes of HDAC enzymes is sufficient for the interaction with the transfected EVI1. This situation is similar to that of Sin3, which, when added in reporter gene assays, does not change noticeably the response of a promoter to a transcription factor because it is already very abundant in the cell. In contrast to what has been reported by others (13Izutsu K. Kurokawa M. Imai Y. Maki K. Mitani K. Hirai H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), these data show that CtBP1 affected directly the response of a promoter to which EVI1 binds through its zinc finger domain.Figure 5CtBP1 and CBP divergently affect the transcription activity of EVI1. NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected and reporter gene assays were carried out 48 h later as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The repression by full-length EVI1 (bar 2) is partially relieved by inactivation of the CtBP1 binding sites (double point mutant EVI1-C,bar 3). Co-transfection with CtBP1 increases the repression of the reporter gene by full-length EVI1 (bar 5) but not by the point mutant EVI1-C (bar 6). In contrast, co-transfection of CBP reverses the function of EVI1 from repressor (bar 2) to weak activator (bar 8). This activation is not observed with a dominant negative (dn) point mutant CBP that has lost the HAT enzymatic function (bar 10). The activity of the CAT reporter gene was normalized with the internal control β-galactosidase. Each assay was carried out in duplicate and repeated at least two times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CBP Abrogates Repression and Induces ActivationWe used reporter gene studies in NIH-3T3 cells to determine whether exogenous CBP has a significant effect on the transcription activity of EVI1. As shown in Fig. 5 (bars 2 and 8), the addition of CBP in the cells resulted not only in the complete relief of repression by EVI1 but in about 30% promoter activation. Because the biological promoters regulated by EVI1 are not known, it is very difficult to state with certainty whether EVI1 is always and only a transcription repressor. It seems, however, that EVI1, as other transcription factors, could function in both ways, depending on the target genes and the need of the cell. To confirm that CBP collaborates with EVI1 in promoter activation, we used a dominant negative form of CBP that has no HAT activity. The results, shown in Fig. 5 (bars 8 and10), suggest that the activation of the promoter by EVI1 requires the active HAT domain of CBP.Up-regulation of Cell Replication by EVI1 Requires the CtBP1-binding RegionWe earlier reported that the forced expression of EVI1 in 32Dcl3 and embryonic stem cell lines leads to a significant up-regulation of cellular replication (7Sitailo S.

Pairing postsynaptic bursts in LMAN principal neurons with stimulation of recurrent collateral synapses had two effects: spike timing- and NMDA receptor-dependent LTP of the recurrent synapses, and LTD of thalamic afferent synapses that were stimulated out of phase with the postsynaptic bursting. Both types of plasticity were restricted to the sensory critical period for song learning, consistent with a role for each in sensory learning. The properties of the observed plasticity are appropriate to establish recurrent circuitry within LMAN that reflects the spatiotemporal pattern of thalamic afferent activity evoked by tutor song. Such circuit organization could represent a tutor song memory suitable for reinforcing particular vocal sequences during sensorimotor learning."

In this study, we attempt to characterize activation signals that transform quiescent keratinocytes into migratory leading cells at the wound edge. Previously, we reported that adhesion and spreading on collagen via integrin α2β1 by cultured human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) requires RhoGTP, a regulator of actin stress fibers. In contrast, adhesion and spreading on laminin 5 requires integrins α3β1 and α6β4 and is dependent on phosphoinositide 3-hydroxykinase (Nguyen, B. P., Gil, S. G., and Carter, W. G. (2000) J. Biol.

By using collagen adhesion as one criterion for conversion to a “leading wound cell,” we found that activation of collagen adhesion requires elevation of RhoGTP. Adhesion of quiescent HFKs to laminin 5 via integrin α3β1 and α6β4is sufficient to increase levels of RhoGTP required for adhesion and spreading on collagen. Consistently, adhesion of quiescent HFKs to laminin 5, but not collagen, also promotes expression of the precursor form of laminin 5, a characteristic of leading keratinocytes in the epidermal outgrowth. We suggest that wounding of quiescent epidermis initiates adhesion and spreading of keratinocytes at the wound edge on endogenous basement membrane laminin 5 via α3β1 and α6β4in a Rho-independent mechanism.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) have suggested that the precursor form of laminin 5 preferentially interacts with α3β1 to mediate migration, whereas the processed form interacts with α6β4. The processed form appears to be the major adhesive ligand in the quiescent epidermis (2Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Ryan M.C. Carter W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 554-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, cells expressing α3β1 readily adhere, spread, migrate, and scatter on the processed form of laminin 5 in vitro (9Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol.

Anim. 1996; 32: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This suggests that the activation state of keratinocytes, not just the processing of laminin 5, determines whether α3β1 interacts with laminin 5 in the BM. Conceivably, initial activation of keratinocytes at the wound edge would allow them to adhere and spread on the processed form of laminin 5 in the BM before they up-regulate expression of precursor laminin 5 as a downstream response. In vitro adhesion and migration studies with antibodies against integrins as well as targeted disruptions of α3in mice (13DiPersio C.M. Hodivala-Dilke K.M. Jaenisch R. Kreidberg J.A. Hynes R.O. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) have established that integrins α3β1 and α2β1mediate adhesion and motility on laminin 5 and collagen, respectively. Leading keratinocytes utilize integrin α2β1and RhoGTP, a regulator of actin stress fibers, to adhere and spread on collagen (9Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31896-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Adhesion and spreading of HFKs on laminin 5 via integrins α3β1 and α6β4is dependent on phosphoinositide 3-hydroxykinase (PI3K) and is resistant to toxin B, a bacterial inhibitor of Rho, that blocks adhesion of leading cells on collagen (9Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31896-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In quiescent tissue, integrins α6β4, α3β1, and α2β1are expressed on the cell surface. In contrast, integrin α5β1 is not expressed in quiescent epidermis and requires synthesis and expression for adhesion to dermal fibronectin (15Toda K. Tuan T.L. Brown P.J. Grinnell F. J.

Wounding of confluent quiescent epidermis results in disruption of cell-cell adhesions, influx of soluble growth factors and cytokines, stress responses, and changes in substrate adhesion (4Woodley, D. T., O'Toole, E., Nadelman, C. M., and Li, W. (1999) Progress in Dermatology, Vol. 33, pp. 1–12.Google Scholar, 5Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar). Each of these wound-induced changes may contribute to initial activation (B) and transition of the quiescent epithelium at the wound margin (A) to the activated leading keratinocytes in the outgrowth (C). Many of the characteristics of quiescent epidermis in vivo are mimicked by culture of keratinocytes at confluent cell densities (16Wallis S. Lloyd S. Wise I. Ireland G. Fleming T.P. Garrod D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, wounding of the confluent cultures or suspension and readhesion at sparse cell densities duplicate the wound-induced changes and promote characteristics of the leading keratinocytes in the outgrowth. For example, culture of Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells or keratinocytes at confluence for multiple days promotes assembly of calcium-independent desmosomes that do not disassemble in the presence of calcium chelators (16Wallis S. Lloyd S. Wise I. Ireland G. Fleming T.P. Garrod D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1077-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Wounding of the confluent epithelial sheet converts the calcium-independent desmosomes to calcium dependence both adjacent to and distant to the wound edge. Similarly, wounding of epidermis disrupts HDs (17Stepp M.A. Spurr-Michaud S. Gipson I.K. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 1829-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stepp M.A. Zhu L. Cranfill R.

However, injury of the confluent epithelium in vivo or in vitro elevates their expression both adjacent to and distant to the wound margin. We have shown previously that deposition of laminin 5 by leading keratinocytes over exposed dermal collagen changes substrate adhesion of the following keratinocytes from collagen and RhoGTP dependent to laminin 5 and PI3K-dependent (9Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31896-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We characterized changes in adhesion and signaling that transform quiescent epidermis at the wound edge into the leading keratinocytes in the epidermal outgrowth. We observed that confluent cultures of human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) fail in Rho-dependent adhesion to collagen but still adhere and spread on laminin 5, independent of Rho. However, HFKs can readily adhere to collagen via α2β1 when cultured at subconfluent cell densities (23Carter W.G. Wayner E.A. Bouchard T.S. Kaur P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). This suggested that the quiescent keratinocytes (A in Reaction A–C) may be able to adhere and spread on endogenous laminin 5 in the BM prior to adhesion to collagen. Only after initial wound activation (B) and subsequent up-regulation of collagen adhesion and expression of precursor laminin 5 would the keratinocytes at the wound margin become leading keratinocytes and migrate over the exposed dermis (C). We hypothesized that quiescent keratinocytes anchored via α6β4 to endogenous BM laminin 5 at the wound edge would spread via α3β1 as an initial activation event. Rho-independent spreading mediated by integrin α3β1 on endogenous laminin 5 may increase RhoGTP required for subsequent adhesion of leading keratinocytes on collagen via α2β1. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether cell-substrate adhesion and spreading on endogenous processed laminin 5 was necessary to provide initial adhesion-dependent signals required for expression of the characteristics of leading cells. The characteristics used to define leading cells are elevated levels of RhoGTP, collagen adhesion, and expression of precursor laminin 5. Based on these findings, we suggest that adhesion and spreading of keratinocytes at the wound edge via integrins α6β4 and α3β1 on endogenous BM laminin 5, respectively, are necessary to increase levels of RhoGTP, collagen adhesion, and expression of precursor laminin 5 that define the migratory keratinocytes in the epidermal outgrowth. Keratinocytes (unpassaged P0 cells) were isolated fresh from normal human foreskins (HFKs) as described previously (24Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. J. Tissue Culture Methods. 1985; 9: 83-93Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar) by digestion with dispase to separate epidermis from dermis, followed by digestion with trypsin/EDTA to separate basal cells from the epidermis. Fresh P0 HFKs were plated onto culture dishes (6 cm) and grown for 3–5 days as subconfluent P1 HFKs. P1 HFKs were passaged with trypsin/EDTA at different seeding densities from 1 × 105 cells per plate for sparse cells to 1 × 106 cells per plate for confluent cells. The cells were grown for 3 days after seeding at the different cell densities. This corresponded to 3 days of culture at 100% confluence at the highest seeding density. P1 and P2 cultures were maintained in serum-free keratinocyte growth media (KGM; Clonetics, Corp., San Diego, CA). Swiss 3T3 cells used as negative base-line controls were grown in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum. Adhesion of HFKs to cryostat sections of epidermis was performed as described previously (9Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol.

Keratinocytes isolated fresh from neonatal foreskin or from culture plates were washed in PBS and counted. Equal numbers of cells were labeled with 0.5 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then added to the different adhesion surfaces (in triplicates per experiment). Cells were allowed 1 h to adhere at 37 °C. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice with PBS. Fluorescent readings of pre-wash and post-wash cells were done on CytoFluorII, and the percentage of fluorescent cells adhered were then calculated as described previously (9Nguyen B.P. Gil S.G. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31896-31907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Laminin 5 stimulation of confluent HFKs (see Fig. 8) was performed as follows. Confluent-derived HFKs were adhered and spread on surfaces coated with laminin 5 at subconfluent densities for 30 min in the absence or presence of inhibitory anti-integrin antibodies. These “stimulated” HFKs were resuspended by digestion with trypsin/EDTA, labeled with 0.5 μm calcein-AM, and assayed for adhesion onto surfaces coated with exogenous collagen I or laminin 5 for 1 h. Where indicated (Fig. 4), adherent cells were fixed and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to detect actin stress fiber in spreading HFKs on immobilized anti-integrin antibodies.Figure 4Confluent-derived HFKs spread on immobilized anti-α3 integrin antibody but not anti-α2. Adhesion and spreading of sparse-derived HFKs (a and b) were compared with confluent-derived HFKs (c and d) on surfaces coated with immobilized anti-α3 integrin (mAb P1B5; a and c) or anti-α2antibodies (mAb P1H5; b and d). Cells were seeded at equal cell numbers and allowed to adhere and spread for 1 h. Cells were then fixed with formaldehyde and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to visualize F-actin and cell spreading. Sparse-derived HFKs adhered and spread on both anti-α3 and anti-α2, whereas confluent-derived HFKs adhered and spread on anti-α3 but did not spread on anti-α2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HFKs were washed once with PBS and solubilized directly with 1% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5 mmEDTA, 50 μm VO4, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Detergent-soluble extracts were quantitated and separated on SDS-PAGE gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose, blocked in 2% nonfat milk, and incubated with the following antibodies: anti-phosphotyrosine (PY-20, ICN), anti-PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p120 catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories). Blots were then washed four times in PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratories)) or rabbit anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated (Dako) for 1 h. Blots were detected with ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and direct exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sparse and confluent HFKs were washed once with PBS and incubated for 1 h in KGM-methionine- and cysteine-free media (Clonetics). 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and -cysteine was added to the media, and cells were labeled for 8 h. Alternatively, sparse and confluent HFKs were surface-biotinylated with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of Biotin (Pierce) for 10 min at 4 °C. Labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS and solubilized directly with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Detergent-soluble extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAbs as follows: P1B5 (anti-α3), P1E6 (anti-α2), P4C10 (anti-β1), or B4–6 (anti-γ2 chain of laminin 5). Precipitates of35S-labeled HFKs were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, dried onto blotting paper, and exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precipitates of biotinylated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in 0.5% BSA + 0.1% Triton/PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h. Blots were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The gels were then directly exposed to Hyperfilm. HFKs were grown at sparse and confluent cell densities for 3 days, suspended with trypsin/EDTA, and re-plated at equal cell numbers onto surfaces coated with laminin 5 or mAbs against integrins anti-α3 (P1B5) or anti-α2 (P1H5), or kept in suspension. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blots were obtained by electrophoresis of total RNA, 20 μg per lane, in formaldehyde-agarose gels (1% agarose, 6.6% formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were blotted to Zeta-Probe nylon membranes (Bio-Rad) by capillary action using 20× SSC. Blots were hybridized in 0.25 m NaCl, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide at 48 °C. Filters were washed at 55 °C with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. cDNA clone Epi, specific for the α3 chain of laminin 5 (provided by Dr. Maureen Ryan, Seattle, WA), and cDNA clone specific for c-Myc (provided by Dr. Bob Eisenman, Seattle, WA) were radiolabeled using the Prime-it RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene) and used as a hybridization probe for Northern analysis. Determining levels of GTP-bound Rho for activity was done as described previously (27Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) with the following variation. Sparse and confluent grown HFKs were plated onto immobilized mAbs or onto laminin 5-coated dishes for 1 h. Cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min, and equal volumes of lysates were incubated with GST-Rhotekin binding domain (20 μg) beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were then washed four times in buffer B (Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. Bound Rho proteins were detected by Western blotting using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Densitometry analysis was performed using AlphaImagerTM system and ImageQuant 4.0 software. The amount of Rhotekin binding domain-bound Rho was normalized to the total amount of Rho in cell lysates for the comparison of Rho activity (level of GTP-bound Rho) in different samples. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each condition with similar results. The collagen receptor, integrin α2β1, is expressed at the cell surface of basal keratinocytes in quiescent epidermis (23Carter W.G. Wayner E.A. Bouchard T.S. Kaur P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 28Carter W.G. Kaur P. Gil S.G. Gahr P.J. Wayner E.A. J.

We determined whether quiescent HFKs isolated fresh from epidermis were able to adhere and spread on collagen via their endogenous α2β1. Quiescent HFKs were isolated fresh from neonatal foreskin (passage 0 or P0 HFKs) and assayed for cell adhesion and spreading on exogenous laminin 5 or collagen. Equal numbers of P0 HFKs were plated and photographed (Fig.1 A, pre-wash). Cells were allowed 1 h to adhere and spread. Non-adherent cells were then washed away (post wash). Freshly isolated P0 HFKs adhered and spread on laminin 5 (Fig. 1 A, panel d) but not to collagen (Fig. 1 A, panel b). In control experiments, P0 HFKs were also adhered to immobilized anti-α2 or anti-α3 integrin antibodies. P0 HFKs were able to adhere to both antibody-coated surfaces but spread only on anti-α3 antibody (data not shown). This confirmed that P0 HFKs, like HFKs in epidermis (23Carter W.G. Wayner E.A. Bouchard T.S. Kaur P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 28Carter W.G. Kaur P. Gil S.G. Gahr P.J. Wayner E.A. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1881-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), express both α2β1 and α3β1. Adhesion and spreading of passage 1 cultured HFKs (P1) grown at subconfluence were compared with P0 HFKs. P1 HFKs were able to adhere and spread on either laminin 5 or collagen (Fig. 1 B), whereas P0 HFKs were only able to adhere and spread on laminin 5. Thus, α2β1 is expressed on the cell surface of freshly isolated P0 HFKs, but these cells adhere poorly to collagen. Activation of the P0 HFKs in culture to generate P1 HFKs is sufficient to increase adhesion to collagen via integrin α2β1. We wished to understand how suspension and re-adhesion of the P0 HFKs could activate adhesion to collagen. Therefore, we attempted to establish an in vitro culture model for the P0 HFKs. We determined whether sparse cultures of P1 and P2 HFKs that can adhere to collagen would reduce collagen adhesion when maintained at confluent cell densities, mimicking the P0 HFKs (Fig. 1). For comparison, we cultured P1 HFKs at both sparse (Fig.2 A, panel a) and confluent cell densities (Fig. 2 A, panel b). The sparse HFKs display characteristics of activated leading edge keratinocytes in epidermal wounds. Sparse HFKs transcribe elevated levels of mRNA encoding the α3 chain of laminin 5 and c-Myc (Fig.2 B, lane S) (6Ryan M.C. Tizard R. VonDevanter D.R. Carter W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22779-22787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HFKs cultured at confluence do not transcribe mRNA for α3 laminin 5 or c-Myc (Fig.2 B, lane C) similar to quiescent keratinocytes in epidermis. We compared sparse and confluent HFKs for adhesion to exogenous laminin 5 or collagen-coated assay plates. Sparse HFKs can adhere and spread on either laminin 5 (Fig. 2 C, black bar) or collagen (Fig. 2 C, striped bar). Culturing HFKs at increasing cell densities inhibits adhesion to collagen (Fig. 2 C, striped bars), whereas adhesion and spreading on laminin 5 (solid bars) remain unaffected. Thus, cultures of P1 and P2 HFKs maintained at sparse cell densities mimic the adhesion, spreading, and transcription characteristics of leading keratinocytes of an epidermal outgrowth in wounds. Cultures of P1 and P2 HFKs maintained at confluence mimic the adhesion and transcription characteristics of quiescent P0 HFKs isolated fresh from epidermis. The transition of keratinocytes from sparse to confluence blocks adhesion and spreading on collagen via endogenous α2β1 but not adhesion and spreading on laminin 5 via α3β1 and α6β4. We were con"

Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The Pol31–32 complex was purified as a side product from the Pol δ overproduction. Pol3 was overexpressed at substantially lower levels than Pol31 and Pol32, and the latter two subunits eluted as a distinct complex from a MonoQ column at ∼350 mm NaCl and from a MonoS column at ∼300 mm NaCl using the same chromatographic conditions that were applied for the purification of Pol δ. The Pol32 subunit, containing an amino-terminal tag with seven histidines, was purified from an Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) containing plasmid pBL370 (11Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To obtain soluble His7-Pol32 protein, the strain was grown and induced at 17 °C, and the induction time was extended to 16 h. His7-Pol32 was isolated from the E. coli cell lysate by ammonium sulfate fractionation, phosphocellulose column chromatography, and nickel-agarose chromatography per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The protein was eluted from the beads at 150 mm imidazole. A Superose 12 gel filtration column was equilibrated at 4 °C in buffer A (40 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% Igepal-40, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmsodium bisulfite, 2 μm leupeptin, and 2 μmpepstatin A). The excluded volume (V0 = 8.2 ml) and included volume (Vi = 19.8 ml) of the column were determined by injection of blue dextran and adenosine, respectively. After this, the elution volume (Ve) was measured for several standard proteins with a known Stokes radius (21Smith M.H. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Proteins II. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1975: 222-250Google Scholar). For each protein,Kav was calculated from Equation 1, and a linear relationship was obtained by plotting (−log Kav)1/2 against the Stokes radius (22Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). Kav=(Ve−Vo)/(Vi−Vo)Eq. 1 The standard proteins used were: carbonic anhydrase (Ve = 15.2 ml), chicken ovalbumin (Ve = 14.2 ml), bovine serum albumin (Ve = 13.4 ml), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (Ve = 12.7 ml), catalase (Ve = 12.5 ml), apoferritin (Ve = 11.1 ml), E. coliβ-galactosidase (Ve = 11.1 ml), and thyroglobulin (Ve = 9.47 ml). 5–100 μg of the different pure protein complexes together with bovine serum albumin as an internal control, in a total volume of 100 μl, were layered on top of a 4.5-ml 10–35% glycerol gradient in buffer A. The samples were spun for 16 h at 50,000 rpm in an SW65 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Whole cell extracts from yeast strain BJ2168 were prepared as described, and 100 μl of the cleared lysate were loaded onto the glycerol gradient (23Burgers P.M. Methods. 1999; 18: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The elution positions of Pol3, Pol31, and Pol32 were determined by Western blot analysis. Standard proteins with known sedimentation coefficients were used to calibrate the gradients: carbonic anhydrase (2.8 S), chicken ovalbumin (3.6 S), bovine serum albumin (4.3 S), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (7.4 S), catalase (11.3 S), E. coliβ-galactosidase (15.9 S), and apoferritin (17.6 S) (21Smith M.H. Fasman G.D. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Proteins II. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1975: 222-250Google Scholar). Pol δ in buffer B (buffer A with 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol instead of dithiothreitol) at three different initial concentrations, 1.8 μm (as monomer), 0.8 μm, and 0.23 μm, was spun at 10 °C for 24 h at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman XL-A centrifuge until equilibrium had been reached, followed by a 24-h spin at 13,000 rpm. Pol31–32 was examined similarly at initial concentrations of 4.6 μm, 2.1 μm, and 0.7 μm. Absorbance measurements were carried out at 280 nm. Molecular mass was calculated from the data using the manufacturer's software. The analysis was carried out as described previously (11Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBL390–10 (lexA-Pol32-CΔ7) carries a POL32 allele lacking the terminal seven amino acids, thereby removing the PCNA-binding domain. This plasmid will be described. 2E. Johansson, A. L. Pautz, and P. M. J. Burgers, unpublished data. In addition to the three subunit Pol δ, we investigated the hydrodynamic parameters of three additional species that could be obtained in stable form: a complex of the catalytic subunit Pol3 with the second subunit Pol31, which we have called Pol δ* and which is structurally analogous to traditionally purified mammalian Pol δ (24Sun Y.B.

Downey K.M. So A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); a complex of the two small subunits (Pol31–32); and the individual third subunit (Pol32). The first three complexes were obtained from overproduction in yeast, but the Pol32 subunit was overproduced in E. coli. Previously, this subunit could not be obtained in soluble form from E. coli lysates and had to be obtained by renaturation from urea-solubilized precipitates (11Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, addition of an N-terminal His7 tag and lowering of the expression temperature in E. coli to 17 °C allowed us to isolate the protein in soluble form (see “Experimental Procedures”). The His7 tag-containing protein fully complements the defects of a yeast POL32 deletion strain.2 The subunits in the Pol δ, Pol δ*, and Pol31–32 complexes are present in equimolar ratios (Fig.1 A, Ref. 20Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For spherical molecules, the molecular mass of a species can be calculated from a combination of the measured Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient using Equation 2 (22Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), M=6πηNas/(1−ν̄ρ)Eq. 2 in which M is the molecular mass, a is the Stokes radius, s is the sedimentation coefficient, ν̄ is the partial specific volume, η is the viscosity of medium, ρ is the density of medium, and N is Avogadro's number. Although this formula does not hold for non-spherical species, in practice a good approximation of the molecular mass can often be obtained because the Stokes radius of an elongated molecule is larger than that of a spherical molecule with the same molecular mass, whereas the sedimentation coefficient of the elongated species is smaller, and the two opposite deviations from ideality tend to cancel when the product is taken in Equation 2. The frictional coefficient f/f0 can be determined from the molecular mass and the Stokes radius as seen in Equation 3.f/fo=a/(3v̄M/4πN)1/3Eq. 3 A Superose 12 gel filtration column was calibrated by injecting proteins with known Stokes radii, and a calibration plot of (−log Kav)1/2 against the Stokes radius was obtained (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig.2 A). After this we injected Pol δ, Pol δ*, Pol31–32, and His7Pol32 over the column. The measured elution volume yielded the (−log Kav)1/2, and we could determine the Stokes radii of the different complexes by interpolation (Fig. 2 A). The results for Pol δ and Pol δ* are comparable with those obtained previously with a Superose 6 gel filtration column (20Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Three species (Pol δ, Pol31–32, and His7Pol32) yielded much larger Stokes radii than anticipated from the molecular masses calculated from the gene sequences, suggesting the presence of either multimeric or extremely elongated species (Fig. 2 A, TableI). In contrast the Stokes radius of Pol δ* suggested that it may exist as a simple heterodimer. Each complex was systematically analyzed at two or three different concentrations starting at 0.5–2 mg/ml at time of injection down to 5–10 μg/ml at time of injection. For no species did we observe a concentration-dependent change in elution volume. For instance, in one series of experiments Pol δ was initially injected onto the column at a concentration of 10 μm (monomer concentration). The peak fractions were reinjected, and this procedure was repeated two more times until the concentration of Pol δ was 20 nm and the subunits could only be detected using Western blot analysis. The elution volume of Pol δ remained constant through this reiterative procedure (data not shown).Table IMolecular weight of Pol δ and subcomplexesSubunitsTheoretical MrforS valueStokes radiusMr from S and Åf/f0Mr from equil. sed.monomerdimerPol3–31-32 (Pol δ)2204407.4 ± 0.470.5 ± 2219 ± 201.78196 ± 10Pol3–31 (Pol δ*)1803607.4 ± 0.452 ± 1162 ± 151.39n.d.1-aNot determined.Pol31–32961914.3 ± 0.459 ± 1106 ± 151.96104 ± 5His7Pol3241822.8 ± 0.450.5 ± 159 ± 122.22n.d.Mr values listed as ×10−3 and Stokes radii in Å.

Indicated errors in the calculated Mrreflect measurement errors only. See text for details. The same complexes were also subjected to velocity sedimentation on a 10–35% glycerol gradient. Proteins with known sedimentation coefficients were included as internal standards, e.g.bovine serum albumin for Pol31–32 (Fig. 1 B). Sedimentation coefficients were obtained by interpolation on the standard curve (Fig.2 B). Again, for each species, sedimentation was carried out at varying protein concentrations (from 0.05–1 mg/ml), representing at least a 10-fold difference in concentration for each species, without observing a concentration-dependent change in S value (data not shown). Finally, a whole cell lysate from log phase wild-type yeast cells was also analyzed on a glycerol gradient. Pol3, Pol31, and Pol32 polypeptides, identified by Western blot analysis, co-sedimented on the glycerol gradient with a sedimentation coefficient of 7.4 S, identical to that obtained for purified Pol δ from the overproduction strain (data not shown). The molecular mass of each complex was calculated from the Stokes radius and the S value. The estimated molecular masses of Pol δ, Pol δ*, and Pol31–32 are consistent with these complexes being monomeric in structure, i.e. composed of one subunit each per complex (Table I). However, the estimated molecular mass of His7Pol32 was 59, halfway between that of a 41 monomer and an 82 dimer. Given the additional fact that both the Stokes radius and the S value of this protein are independent of concentration, it must be clear that the shape of this protein is such that its molecular mass cannot be determined using these hydrodynamic parameters and Equation2. The calculated frictional ratio of His7Pol32 (assuming that it is a monomer) is 2.22, indicating that the protein is extremely elongated. Even if we assume Pol32 to be dimeric, the frictional ratio would still be 1.78, suggesting a very elongated shape. In addition, all larger complexes containing Pol32 are also much more elongated than those without; e.g. compare Pol δ* with Pol δ. Consequently, we turned to equilibrium sedimentation analysis to determine molecular masses more accurately, because our molecular mass estimation of Pol δ and Pol31–32 using Equation 2 must be considered unreliable in view of the presence of Pol32 in these complexes. In this technique the distribution of a molecule across the cell is dependent on its molecular mass but not on its shape. Therefore, equilibrium sedimentation is an ideal technique for molecular mass determinations of non-spherical complexes in Equation 4, C(r)=C(r0)eω2M(1−v̄ρ)(r2−r02)/2RTEq. 4 in which C(r) and C(r0) are the concentrations at radius r and a reference point r0, respectively, ω is the radial speed, and R and T are the gas constant and the temperature. Unfortunately, this analysis could only be carried out with Pol δ and Pol31–32, because Pol δ* and His7Pol32 aggregated significantly during the extended period of centrifugation necessary to reach equilibrium. For Pol δ, the same distribution curve was obtained at each of three concentrations examined, 1.8 μm(as monomer), 0.8 μm, and 0.23 μm. Therefore, a global analysis of the data at all three concentrations was carried out, assuming the presence of a single species, which yielded a molecular mass of 196. No better fit was obtained when we assumed the presence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Fig.3 A shows the data points for the highest concentration of Pol δ together with the expected curves for a monomer or a dimer of Pol δ. We also carried out sedimentation studies of Pol δ in buffer B containing 5 mmMgCl2 and 125 mm NaCl with essentially identical results, suggesting that dimerization is not induced under conditions when Pol δ is active for DNA synthesis (data not shown). The data for Pol31–32 were also obtained at three different concentrations: 4.6 μm, 2.1 μm, and 0.7 μm. A global fit yielded a molecular mass of 104 kDa, very close to the theoretical molecular mass of 96. If we assume a monomer-dimer equilibrium and fix the M of the monomer at that of the theoretical value of 96, we obtain a dimerization constant of ∼300 μm from the global fit, but this fit is not statistically better than the fit for a monomeric species. Therefore, based upon these sedimentation data we conclude that both Pol31–32 and Pol δ, purified from yeast overproduction strains, are monomeric in solution. We have previously carried out an analysis of subunit-subunit interactions of Pol δ using the two-hybrid system (11Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These studies, together with biochemical studies, indicate that Pol3 interacts primarily with Pol31, which in turn binds Pol32. In addition, both two-hybrid studies and biochemical experiments showed an interaction between Pol32 and the replication clamp PCNA (11Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 26Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During these studies, however, we also noted the presence of a small but significant interaction signal when we carried out a Pol32-Pol32 two-hybrid analysis and suggested that the observed signal was indicative of dimerization of Pol32 and therefore supportive of the model that Pol δ is dimeric in vivo. Recently, we carried out a deletion study of the POL32 gene.2The PCNA-binding motif in Pol32 is localized to the extreme carboxyl terminus of Pol32, as was observed for the S. pombe ortholog Cdc27 (27Reynolds N. Warbrick E. Fantes P.A. MacNeill S.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal seven amino acids of Pol32 yields a mutant (Pol32-CΔ7) that fails to interact with PCNA in vitro as well as in a two-hybrid analysis. The truncated protein is chromatographically identical (including gel filtration analysis) to full-length Pol32. When we tested this truncated form of Pol32 in a two-hybrid analysis (Pol32-CΔ7 was fused to the lexA DNA-binding domain and full-length Pol32 to the Gal4 activation domain) no signal indicative of interaction was observed. We interpret these results to mean that the positive signal observed in the wild-type Pol32-Pol32 two-hybrid assay was actually due to a bridging interaction by PCNA (lexA-pol32-PCNA-Pol32-Gal4), which was eliminated using the PCNA interaction-defective Pol32-CΔ7. Therefore, we can detect no in vivo interaction suggestive of Pol32 dimerization. A biochemical characterization of S. pombe Pol δ and of several subcomplexes was recently published (15Zuo S. Bermudez V. Zhang G. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5153-5162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results of this study are very similar to ours. The gel filtration analysis of the Cdc27 protein suggested that this protein is either multimeric or an extremely elongated species. Further analysis by gel filtration of the Pol3-Cdc1-Cdm1 complex and the Pol3-Cdc1-Cdm1-Cdc27 complex suggested that the four-subunit complex is a dimer of the heterotetramer and, moreover, that the Cdc27 subunit may play an important role contributing to the dimerization of Pol δ. Interestingly, very large complexes ranging from 260–500 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration analysis, were also detected in highly purified Pol δ preparations containing the p68 subunit (the human ortholog of Pol32) (28Mo J. Liu L. Leon A. Mazloum N. Lee M.Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Considering our finding that the Pol32 subunit is highly elongated and that Cdc27 and p68 are the orthologs of Pol32, we suggest that these subunits may also be very elongated and yield abnormally large estimates of the molecular mass of the analogous preparations of Pol δ when analyzed by gel filtration. Our studies indicate that Pol δ isolated from an S. cerevisiae overproduction strain has a monomeric structure in solution. An analysis of the size of Pol δ in extracts from wild-type yeast cells gave the same result. Although Pol3 and Pol31 may be fairly globular based upon the analysis of Pol δ*, the presence of Pol32 in the complex gives the entire complex a very elongated shape (Fig. 4). These findings do not address the structure of this enzyme at the replication fork. If Pol δ replicates both the leading and the lagging strand of the fork, putative dimerization of the two sides of the fork may be mediated by other factors. However, in light of the present results, a reinvestigation of the role of Pol ε in bulk DNA replication is justified."

Nature. 1990; 347: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 25LaVail M.M. Kazuhiro U. Yasumura D. Matthes M.T. Yancopoulos G.D. Steinberg R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sci. 2000; 41: 3622-3633PubMed Google Scholar), and PR-targeted FGFR inactivation leads to retinal degeneration in mice (27Campochiaro P.A. Chang M. Ohsato M. Vinores S.A. Nie Z. Hjelmeland L. Mansukhani A. Basilico C. Zack D.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1679-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, FGF2 induces PR differentiation (28Hicks D. Courtois Y. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2022-2033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and directly stimulates survival of purified PR (29Fontaine V. Kinkl N. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9662-9672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complexity of the central nervous system has rendered the analysis of molecular pathways underlying neurotrophic actions very difficult, but their understanding is essential for the development of rational therapeutic strategies. Although recent studies have implicated ERK activation in FGF2 signaling (30Désiré L. Courtois Y. Jeanny J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Wahlin K.J. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. Adler R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 927-936PubMed Google Scholar), for the moment there is no evidence that PR survival is directly influenced via the ERK pathway. We have exploited primary cultures of different retinal cells (purified PR, inner retina (IR, without PR), and purified Müller glial cells (MGC)) to determine whether FGF2-related signaling molecules have distinct expression patterns between the different cell populations and whether FGF2 possesses multiple pathways for signal transduction in the retina. This is indeed the case, PR survival depending uniquely upon ERK activation via MEK. Whereas in FGF2-treated PR, MEK seems to be the only upstream ERK activator, additional MEK-independent pathways exist in IR and MGC. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), CO2-independent DMEM (DMEM/−CO2), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin, and molecular weight markers were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), desoxyribonuclease 1 (DNase 1), gelatin, laminin, poly-d-lysine, and all other reagents used for cell culture were from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). Papain and collagenase were obtained from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Recombinant human FGF2 was from Strathmann Biotech (Hamburg, Germany), and nerve growth factor (NGF) was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). U0126 was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Shc antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies for FGFR1–4, ERK1/2, MEK1, MEK2, PLCγ1, SH-PTP2, SOS1, SOS2, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Grb2 and anti-Akt antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Anti-vimentin (clone V9) antibody was obtained from Dako (Trappes, France). Anti-arrestin antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Y. De Kozak (INSERM U. 450, Paris, France). Alexa FluorTM-conjugated antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals(Meylan, France). Wistar rats used for the experiments were cared for and handled in compliance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Animals were deeply anesthetized by CO2 inhalation and killed by cervical dislocation. Cultures of PR and IR were fixed after 3 days in vitro for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. For immunostaining cultured cells were pemeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS for 5 min) and then saturated with PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% NaN3 (blocking solution). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml: anti-FGFR1, anti-FGFR2, anti-FGFR3, anti-FGFR4, anti-SOS1, anti-SOS2, anti PLCγ1, anti-SH-PTP2, anti-Shc, anti-ERK1/2, anti-Akt, and anti-Grb2. For controls, primary antibodies were preadsorbed with their corresponding immunizing peptides used at 50-fold higher concentration. Primary antibodies were localized using goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG/Alexa FluorTM 488 secondary antibodies. Immunostained slides and cells were examined using a Nikon Optiphot 2 photomicroscope equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski optics. PR and IR were isolated as described previously, using a modified technique (32Dreyfus H. Guérold B. Fontaine V. Sahel J. Hicks D. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 574-585PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fontaine V. Hicks D. Dreyfus H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) originally developed for PR transplantation (34Silverman M.S. Huges S.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1989; 30: 1684-1690PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain purified fractions of PR and IR. Briefly, PN5 retina were flat-mounted PR-down on a gelatin block and the entire preparation cooled with DMEM/−CO2. A first cut was made at a depth of 100 μm from the vitreal surface to isolate the IR, containing the ganglion cell, inner plexiform, and inner nuclear layers (GCL, IPL, and INL, respectively). Fractions were collected in Ringer's solution without Ca2+ supplemented with 2.5 mmEDTA and kept at 4 °C. A second cut of about 50 μm eliminated remaining INL, outer plexiform layer, and a part of the PR layer. A final cut of 250–300 μm undercut the PR layer still attached to the gelatin block. Fractions were incubated in Ringer's solution without Ca2+, plus EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min to separate PR from the gelatin. After three washes in Ringer's solution PR and IR were digested with 500 μl of activated papain (0.1 mg/ml Ringer's solution) for 20 min at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped with 500 μl of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM/10% FBS), 50 μl of DNase 1 (1 mg/ml), and 0.1% BSA and the cells incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. After dissociation the cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of serum-supplemented DMEM. Viable cell numbers were determined and the cells seeded at 5 × 105 cells/cm2 into poly-d-lysine-coated (2 μg/cm2 during 1 h) culture dishes. For immunohistochemistry of PR and IR and for PR survival assays, cells were seeded at lower density (105cells/cm2) on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (2 μg/cm2 during 1 h) and laminin (1 μg/cm2 overnight). Cultures of MGC were established using a previously described technique (35Hicks D. Courtois Y. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 5: 119-129Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and used after one passage (∼7–10 days in vitro). Cultures of mixed brain glia (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) were prepared from neonatal rat brain cerebral cortex using previously published methods (36Saneto R.P. de Vellis J. Turner A.J. Bachelard H.S. Neurochemistry: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 27-63Google Scholar) and used after one passage. PR and IR were cultured for 24 h in DMEM/10% FBS. Then cells were rinsed with DMEM and replaced in a chemically defined medium (CDM) (29Fontaine V. Kinkl N. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9662-9672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 48 h. Confluent MGC and brain glial cell cultures grown in DMEM/10% FBS were rinsed with DMEM and replaced in CDM for 48 h. Cells were stimulated with FGF2 (100 ng/ml) for 30 s to 30 min. For some experiments cultures were treated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 (10–50 μm) for 30 min prior to growth factor stimulation. Two additional trials using U0126 were performed: MGC were preincubated with U0126 (10 μm) for 30 min and stimulated with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min, and mixed neonatal brain glia were preincubated with U0126 (10 μm) for 30 min and stimulated with FGF2 (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. The survival assay for PR was conducted as described previously (29Fontaine V. Kinkl N. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9662-9672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after 24 h DMEM/10% FBS was replaced by CDM supplemented or not with FGF2 (20 ng/ml) and U0126 (100 nm to 1 μm). FGF2 and U0126 were added again after 72 h. After 5 days in vitro the viability of PR was tested by the Live/Dead assay (37Vaughan P.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 9662-9667Crossref Google Scholar). For each coverslip 25 fields were recorded (using 20× objective for observation) using Visiolab 1000 image analysis software (Biocom, Lyon, France), and cells were counted. For each treatment in each experiment two coverslips were counted and the experiment conducted three times. Statistical analysis was performed using the parametric Peritz’ F test according to Harper (38Harper J.F. Comput. Biol Med. 1984; 14: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), values of p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. For immunodetection of FGFR1–4, Akt, ERK1/2, Grb2, MEK1, MEK2, PLCγ1, Shc, SH-PTP2, SOS1, SOS2, arrestin, and vimentin, cultures of PR, IR (3 d in vitro), and MGC were rinsed with PBS and collected in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. For anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 immunoblots, cultures were washed once with PBS and stimulated with growth factors for different times. The reaction was stopped by addition of liquid nitrogen. Cells were then collected in lysis buffer and lysed as above. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, the membranes were blocked with PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 3% BSA, 1% fat-free milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. For all other antibodies membranes were blocked PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% fat-free milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-FGFR, signaling intermediates, and cell type-specific markers, each 1 μg/ml final concentration) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (0.15 μg/ml). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a Pierce Super Signal West Pico kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some trials Western blots probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody were stripped and subsequently reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody. Molecular weights were compared with prestained molecular weight markers. Antisera against FGFR1–4 were used to investigate expression and distribution of FGFR and second messengers in the different culture models. FGFR1 and FGFR4 were clearly and uniformly expressed at the surface of cultured PN5 PR, whereas FGFR2 and especially FGFR3 stained only weakly (Fig.1, A–H). Within cultures of IR, which contain a mixed population of neurons (bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells) and MGC, all four FGFR were detected (Figs. 1,I–P). FGFR1 stained neurons and glia with equal intensity, while FGFR2–4 labeled neurons more intensely than MGC. If antibodies were used that had been preadsorbed with their corresponding immunizing peptides, staining was completely abolished (data not shown). Immunostaining of cultured retinal cells with antisera directed against second messenger molecules (PLCγ1, SOS1, SOS2, ERK, SH-PTP2, SHC) showed uniform PR, neuronal, and glial labeling (data not shown). Expression of FGFR1–4 and the various signaling molecules were further compared between different culture models using Western blotting techniques. Culture purity was checked using cell type-specific antibodies; arrestin immunoreactivity was specifically expressed in PR but was absent from IR and MGC cultures, whereas vimentin immunoreactivity was detected in IR and MGC but not in PR cultures (Fig. 2 A). FGFR1 was detected in PR at a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa. In IR, immunopositive bands were detected at 140 and 100 kDa and in MGC at 150, 125, and 100 kDa. FGFR2-positive bands were found in PR, IR, and MGC at 90 kDa. Additional bands were observed in MGC cultures at 130 and 100 kDa. Western blots probed with the FGFR4 antibody revealed a single band at ∼120 kDa in PR, IR, and MGC. For all receptors MGC exhibited stronger signals compared with PR and IR (Fig.2 B). If antibodies were preadsorbed with their corresponding immunizing peptides prior to immunoblotting, no positive bands were observed (data not shown). We were not able to obtain satisfactory results on Western blots using the FGFR3 antibody. Western blots for FGF-related signaling molecules revealed that despite loading of equal total protein concentrations between fractions, PR preparations showed consistently lower relative amounts of each protein examined compared with IR and MGC (Fig.3). Levels of PLCγ1, SOS2, Akt, and Grb2 were markedly lower in PR than in IR and MGC, while levels of SOS1 and SH-PTP2 were equivalent. Specific differences in expression of ERK1/2 and Shc were observed; while ERK2 was present at similar levels between the three samples, ERK1 was notably reduced in PR; and while three isoforms of Shc at 46, 52, and 66 kDa were observed in both IR and MGC, the 46-kDa isoform was very weak and the 66-kDa isoform undetectable in PR (Fig. 3). SOS1 and Akt were more abundant in pure MGC than in mixed IR cultures. To examine FGF2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, PR, IR, and MGC cultures were incubated for increasing times with a fixed dose of FGF2 and samples immunoblotted with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. In PR cultures, as described previously (29Fontaine V. Kinkl N. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9662-9672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of major bands at ∼140, 120, 105, 95, 74, and 65 kDa and minor bands with molecular masses of ∼180 and 155 kDa (Fig.4 A). The most prominent bands at 140 and 120 kDa had already increased in intensity at 30 s and reached their maximum at 2 min. In IR cultures, FGF2 induced time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of bands at ∼180, 120, 90, 65 and a closely spaced doublet of 55 and 53 kDa (Fig.4 B). The major band at 120 kDa had already reached maximal intensity by 30 s, remaining strongly stimulated at 2 min and decreasing by 5 min. The band at 180 kDa was phosphorylated at approximately similar levels throughout the times examined, the proteins at ∼90 and 65 kDa demonstrated highest staining at 2 min, and the doublet at 55 and 53 kDa became maximally stimulated after 5 min. MGC cultures treated with FGF2 showed the same pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated bands as IR and one additional band with a molecular mass >200 kDa (Fig. 4 C). The band at 120 kDa showed maximal stimulation already after 30 s and maintained this level up to 5 min. The band at 65 kDa showed increased phosphorylation after 30 s and reached its maximum at 1 min. The 90-kDa band showed only a weak increase in phosphorylation between 30 s and 2 min but showed a strong phosphorylation after 5 min. The bands at 180 and >200 kDa increased steadily in intensity over the duration of incubation. The different phosphotyrosine profiles for each culture model are schematized in Fig. 6 D to facilitate comparison.Figure 6Effect of U0126 on FGF2 induced ERK activation in vitro. A, cultures of PR, IR, and MGC were preincubated with the MEK inhibitor U0126 for 30 min and then stimulated with FGF2 (100 ng/ml) for 30 min. Total proteins (20 μg/lane) were analyzed by Western blot using anti-phospho-ERK antibody. ERK activation was completely blocked in PR in the presence of 10 μm U0126. In IR and MGC, phosphorylated ERK1/2 was still clearly detectable. U0126 at 20 μm led to a 2-fold reduction in intensity of ERK immunolabeling in IR and MGC compared with cultures stimulated with FGF2 alone, but ERK activation was still marked. In each case (PR, IR, MGC), the upper row shows the treatments used (FGF2, U0126 at 10 or 20 μm), the middle row shows immunodetection of phospho-ERK (pERK1/2), and the lower rowshows immunodetection of total ERK1/2 (Western blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to ERK1/2). To test the efficacy of U0126 at the concentrations used, neonatal rat cortical mixed glia were stimulated with FGF2 (B), or MGC were stimulated with NGF (C) in the presence or absence of the U0126 (10 μm). In both cases growth factor-induced activation of ERK1/2 was blocked totally by the MEK inhibitor. The upper row shows treatments and concentrations used (FGF2, NGF, U0126 at 10 μm), the middle row shows immunodetection of pERK1/2, and the lower row shows immunodetection of total ERK1/2 (Western blots were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to ERK1/2). Panels are representative of three independent experiments that gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the ERK pathway represents a major pathway for FGF2-induced signaling in neurons (19Creuzet C. Loeb J. Barbin G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and glia (39Baron W. Metz B. Bansal R. Hoekstra D. de Vries H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 314-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we investigated whether exogenous application of FGF2 could induce phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in PR, IR, and MGC cultures in vitro. Cultures were incubated for 15 or 30 min with FGF2, and ERK1/2 activation was monitored by immunoblotting using phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody. As shown in Fig.5, after 15 min of stimulation IR and MGC cultures showed an increase in phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, whereas no ERK activation was observed in PR. Within IR samples the increase was almost completely restricted to ERK2, while MGC showed equally intense labeling for both isoforms. After 30-min stimulation the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 had further increased in IR and MGC, and for IR samples was now also elevated in ERK1. Phospho-ERK1/2 was also visible in PR at this time point, predominantly in ERK2, showing the direct activation of the ERK pathway by FGF2 in these cells. Since exogenous application of FGF2 led to activation of the ERK pathway in PR, IR, and MGC, we examined whether we could suppress the ERK1/2 activation with the MEK1- and MEK2-specific inhibitor U0126 (40Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Cultures of PR, IR, and MGC were preincubated with U0126 and then stimulated with FGF2 for 30 min and phospho-ERK1/2 detected as above. U0126 completely blocked ERK1/2 activation in PR at concentrations of 10 and 20 μm(Fig. 6 A). In contrast, in IR and MGC the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was decreased but not completely blocked (Fig. 6 A). U0126 used at 20 μm led to a 2-fold decrease in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but compared with control cultures, the activation of ERK1/2 was still marked. Even a concentration of 50 μm U0126 did not further decrease ERK1/2 phosphorylation in IR and MGC (data not shown). Use of another MEK inhibitor PD098059 (50 and 100 μm) to block ERK activation in MGC confirmed these results (data not shown). To verify that the persistent ERK phosphorylation in IR and MGC was not due to incomplete inhibition of MEK, two different controls were performed. Neonatal rat brain glia were treated with FGF2 in the presence or absence of U0126; the inhibitor entirely blocked FGF2-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with only residual background activation remaining (Fig. 6 B). In the second, MGC cultures were stimulated with NGF in the presence or absence of U0126; whereas NGF induced sustained ERK1/2 activation in MGC, in cultures preincubated with U0126 this effect was completely inhibited (Fig.6 C). These two results showed clearly that U0126, at the concentrations used, efficiently blocked MEK and inhibited downstream ERK phosphorylation. No differences in protein expression levels of MEK1 and MEK2 were observed in the retinal cultures; Western blots revealed distinct and uniformly expressed bands at 42 and 45 kDa for MEK1 and MEK2, respectively, in PR, IR, and MGC (Fig.7). We previously reported that survival of purified PR in vitro is directly stimulated by FGF2 (29Fontaine V. Kinkl N. Sahel J. Dreyfus H. Hicks D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9662-9672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether this effect of FGF2 was mediated by ERK1/2 activation, survival of control and FGF2-treated PR after 1 or 5 days in vitrowas monitored using a cytotoxicity assay kit. Survival at 5 days was chosen because the previous study showed the survival-promoting effect of FGF2 to be maximal at"

J., 1998 Mol. Microbiol.30, 245–257). The ligand-binding activity is located in the ∼500-residue A-region (residues 44–542), which represents the N-terminal half of the MSCRAMM protein. We now hypothesize that the ClfB A-region is composed of three subdomains, which we have named N1, N2, and N3, respectively. To examine this hypothesis, we expressed recombinant forms of the individual putative subdomains, the tandem motifs N12 and N23, and the full-length A-region N123. Far UV circular dichroism spectra showed that each subdomain is composed mainly of β-sheets with little or no discernible α-helices. Heat-induced unfolding of individual subdomains occurred with a single state transition and was reversible, indicating that the subdomains can fold as discreet units. Gel permeation chromatography indicated that N2, N3, and N23 are globular. In contrast, domain N1 appeared to be elongated and conferred a somewhat elongated structure on segments containing this subdomain (i.e. N12 or N123). N123, N12, and N23 all bound to fibrinogen, but N23 had a higher affinity for fibrinogen than that observed for the full-length A-region; N123 or for N12. However, an extended N terminus of N23 was required for ligand binding. A form of N23 that was generated by proteolytic processing and lacked the N-terminal extension was unable to bind fibrinogen. Recombinant forms of individual subdomains did not bind fibrinogen. The addition of recombinant N23 effectively inhibited ClfB-mediated bacterial adherence to fibrinogen, and N123 caused some reduction in bacterial attachment, whereas N12 was essentially inactive. Antibodies raised against the central N2 domain of the A-region were the most effective at inhibiting bacterial adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, although anti-N3 or anti-N1 antibodies also caused some reduction in ClfB-mediated adherence to fibrinogen. The clumping factor B (ClfB) ofStaphylococcus aureus is a surface protein that binds to fibrinogen (Nı́ Eidhin, D., Perkins, S., Francois, P., Vaudaux, P., Hook, M., and Foster, T. J., 1998 Mol.

It causes a variety of infections ranging from superficial skin infections to deep-seated local lesions and life-threatening systemic infections. The molecular pathogenesis of these infections is complex, initiated by the adherence of the bacteria to ligands in the host. Bacterial adherence involves surface structures called adhesins that in specific interactions bind to ligands in the host. For S. aureus, which primarily causes extracellular infections, the responsible adhesins are of the MSCRAMM (microbial surfacecomponents recognizing adhesivematrix molecules) subfamily that specifically target extracellular matrix components in host tissues (1Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar).

ClfA and ClfB are structurally related and have an identical domain organization (Fig. 1) with an N-terminal secretory signal sequence, the ligand-binding A-region, and a dipeptide repeat region R composed mainly of aspartate and serine residues. Region R is required to project the ligand-binding region from the cell surface and to transverse the cell wall (13Hartford O. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Sequences involved in positioning the proteins at the cell surface and anchoring them to the cell wall (W) are located toward the C termini and include an LPXTG motif, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain (M), and a short positively charged cytoplasmic tail (C). The ligand-binding A-regions of ClfA and ClfB exhibit 26% residue identity. Despite sequence and structural similarity of the two clumping factors, they target different sites in fibrinogen. ClfA binds to the extreme C terminus of the γ-chain (4O'Connell D.P. Nanavaty T. McDevitt D. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. Foster T.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the expression of the two proteins in the growth curve of S. aureus differ; ClfA is expressed at all stages of growth, whereas ClfB is only found on the surface of cells in early exponential phase (8Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Hook M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report on a biophysical characterization of the ligand-binding A-region of ClfB. We propose that the A-region of ClfB is composed of three subdomains that we have called N1, N2, and N3 (Fig. 1). The reasoning for this hypothesis is as follows. The A-region of ClfB can be cleaved at the two alanine residues in the SLAVA motif by metalloproteases removing residues 44–197 or 44–199 from the N terminus (15McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29969-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This suggests that the SLAVA motif is part of a sequence that separates two distinct domains. We propose that this N-terminal segment represents the N1 subdomain. Sequence and predicted secondary structure alignments of ClfB and CNA suggest that the minimal collagen binding domain of CNA corresponding to residues 197–375 shows 15% identity and 45% homology with the proposed N2 subdomain of ClfB. We further propose that the C-terminal one-third of the A-region represents the third subdomain called N3, defined by residues 375–542. We now have expressed the putative subdomains of the ClfB A-region as recombinant proteins, as individual subdomains (N1, N2, N3), tandem motifs (N12, N23), and full-length A-region (N123). These recombinant proteins are characterized and tested for their ability to bind fibrinogen.DISCUSSIONClfB is a member of a family of structurally related surface proteins present on S. aureus cells that currently includes seven additional members: ClfA, FnbpA, FnbpB, SdrC, SdrD, SdrE, and CNA. These proteins are all of similar size (molecular mass ∼100,000 Da) and contain at the C terminus structural features required for cell wall anchoring including an LPXTG sequence recognized by the transpeptidase sortase, a hydrophobic domain that may span the membrane, and a short cytoplasmic tail composed primarily of positively charged residues. Although the amino acid sequences immediately outside the cell wall anchoring domain vary substantially among the different members, some specific regions are found in several proteins, and smaller subgroups can be defined within the family based on these shared regions (for a review, see Ref. 2Foster T.J. Hook M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal halves of all of the proteins, called the A-region, are similar in size and composed of significantly similar amino acid sequences. Furthermore, deconvolution of the CD spectra of recombinant versions of these A-regions suggests that they contain a similar composition of secondary structures.We now propose that each of the A-regions are composed of three subdomains that we have called N1, N2, and N3. Using ClfB as a model protein, we have attempted to provide support for this hypothesis. The border between the N1 and N2 subdomains was defined by a proteolytically sensitive SLAVA motif. Furthermore, comparison of amino acid sequence and secondary structure prediction between the minimal collagen-binding motif of CNA and ClfB defines N2. The different subdomains expressed as recombinant proteins have a defined secondary structure composition as shown by CD analysis, and they refold after heat denaturation, suggesting that they could represent individual folding units. Recombinant N2 and N3 behaved on gel permeation chromatography as globular proteins, and it appears likely that these regions represent distinct subdomains. The N1 protein behaves as an extended, nonglobular protein in gel permeation chromatography. Another possibility is that the N1 subdomain forms a dimer, which would account for the larger Stokes radii (RS ) for proteins containing N1 in Table II. However, neither nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis nor analytical ultracentrifugation analysis showed the presence of N1-containing dimers (data not shown). Furthermore, N1 contains a large percentage of hydrophilic amino acid residues, and N1 migrates abnormally under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE. Clearly, the N1 sequence is not a globular structure. However, it is not clear if N1 folds as one subdomain or if N1 is composed of several distinct domains.Although the different putative domains can fold independently, it is clear that at least N2 and N3 interact if they are expressed together, as can be concluded from the denaturation experiments. The recombinant isolated N3 domain denatures at ∼37 °C. However, temperature denaturation of the N23 tandem motif does not reveal any partial unfolding at this low temperature. Instead, the N23 tandem motif remains intact up to ∼50 °C, when it unfolds in apparently one step, indicating that in the N23 tandem motif the structure of N3 is stabilized by the presence of N2. Furthermore, none of the putative subdomains are able to bind fibrinogen when expressed and analyzed individually. However, the N23 tandem motif binds fibrinogen in a specific, concentration-dependent and saturable manner with an apparent KD of 2 × 10−8m. Also, the N12 tandem motif binds fibrinogen but with an apparent lower affinity. Taken together, these results suggest that the protein segment required for forming a fibrinogen-binding site is not contained in an isolated subdomain but that two subdomains (N12 or N23) are needed to form an active protein. This does not imply that sequences from the two subdomains combine to form the actual binding region. It is possible that sequences within a specific subdomain are found in the binding region but that the folding of the subdomain and the formation of an active site are influenced by neighboring sequences. This possibility appears to be supported by the finding that both N12 and N23 bind fibrinogen and that proteolytically processed N23 with an exposed N terminus at residue Ala199 is unable to bind fibrinogen, but when this protein construct contains a short unrelated N-terminal extension it acquires fibrinogen-binding activity. These observations also suggest that the N2 subdomain plays a key role in fibrinogen binding. In apparent support of this hypothesis, we found that antibodies raised against the N2 subdomain were the most efficient in inhibiting the binding of ClfB-mediated adherence to fibrinogen, although antibodies to both the N3 and the N1 subdomains also had some inhibitory activity.The proteolytic processing of ClfB, which results in the removal of the N1 domain, occurs both on intact S. aureus cells (8Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Hook M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and during the isolation of recombinant A-region produced in E. coli (15McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29969-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In both cases, the protease is a metalloprotease, and this processing can be largely prevented by the addition of EDTA. The N1 segment does not appear to be released as an intact subdomain, but a set of shorter peptides can be detected from the processing of the recombinant protein. 2S. Perkins, E. J. Walsh, C. C. S. Deivanayagam, S. V. L. Narayana, T. J. Foster, and M. Höök, unpublished observation. This observation supports the idea that N1 is not a tightly packed globular subdomain but contains many sites that are susceptible to proteolytic attack.The biological implications of an MSCRAMM composed of several subdomains, which may be proteolytically processed, are unclear. A regulated processing of N1 could greatly affect the fibrinogen binding activity of the remaining N23 domains of ClfB. Thus, a recombinant N23 appears to bind fibrinogen with a higher affinity compared with that observed with the intact A-region. A partial removal of the N1 subdomain may lead to an activation of fibrinogen-binding activity, whereas a complete removal of the N1 subdomain results in loss of fibrinogen-binding activity, since cleaved N23 does not bind fibrinogen.Does the proposed model of the subunit organization and processing of the ClfB A-region also apply to other structurally related proteins onS. aureus? We believe that the ClfA A-region is very similar to the ClfB A-region. The minimal fibrinogen-binding activity is located within a subregion composed of the N23 tandem motif. The putative N1 subdomain is hydrophilic and readily processed (7McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29Josefsson E. McCrea K.W. Nı́ Eidhin D. O'Connell D. Cox J. Hook M. Foster T.J. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The N1-N2 interface contains the site SLAVA in both ClfB and ClfA, which can be targeted by metalloproteases. Analysis of the FnbpA and FnbpB A-regions, both of which we recently showed to contain a fibrinogen-binding site, suggests that these have a similar organization. In fact, an N23 construct of FnbpA was shown to bind fibrinogen (5Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Subdomains in FnbpA and FnbpB are hydrophilic, and proteolytic processing of FnbpA has been reported (30McGavin M.J. Zahradka C. Rice K. Scott J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2621-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a SLAVA motif is not present in either of these MSCRAMMs. Also, in the CNA A-region we can identify three subdomains, and the recombinant A-region behaves as a nonglobular extended protein (3Rich R.L. Demeler B. Ashby K. Deivanayagam C.C. Petrich J.W. Patti J.M. Narayana S.V. Hook M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15423-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the N1 subdomain is less hydrophilic compared with this domain in other members of this protein family, and no partial processing has been observed. Furthermore, the ligand (collagen) binding site is functional in an isolated N2 subdomain of CNA (31Patti J.M. Boles J.O. Hook M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11428-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations point to a common structural subdomain organization of the A-regions of these proteins.The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the recombinant putative subdomains of ClfB supports the proposed multidomain hypothesis for the A-regions. However, the ultimate proof of this hypothesis will come from a structural analysis of these proteins. We are currently involved in trying to solve the crystal structures of several MSCRAMMs. As additional structural information becomes available, we will undoubtedly refine our understanding of the organization and mechanism of action of these important proteins. Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen of humans and animals. It causes a variety of infections ranging from superficial skin infections to deep-seated local lesions and life-threatening systemic infections. The molecular pathogenesis of these infections is complex, initiated by the adherence of the bacteria to ligands in the host. Bacterial adherence involves surface structures called adhesins that in specific interactions bind to ligands in the host. For S. aureus, which primarily causes extracellular infections, the responsible adhesins are of the MSCRAMM (microbial surfacecomponents recognizing adhesivematrix molecules) subfamily that specifically target extracellular matrix components in host tissues (1Patti J.M. Allen B.L. McGavin M.J. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 585-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). So far eight structurally related putative S. aureus MSCRAMMs have been identified and partially characterized (2Foster T.J. Hook M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). These cell wall-anchored proteins all contain a ∼500-amino acid long A-region with significant sequence similarity (20–61% pairwise identity) and similar predicted secondary structure compositions.

A ligand-binding subdomain of the A-region of CNA was crystallized, and its structure was solved. The secondary structure composition of this protein as determined by its x-ray crystal structure was 8% α-helix, 53% β-sheet, and 39% coil (6Symersky J. Patti J.M. Carson M. House-Pompeo K. Teale M.

Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3387-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The N1-N2 interface contains the site SLAVA in both ClfB and ClfA, which can be targeted by metalloproteases. Analysis of the FnbpA and FnbpB A-regions, both of which we recently showed to contain a fibrinogen-binding site, suggests that these have a similar organization. In fact, an N23 construct of FnbpA was shown to bind fibrinogen (5Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Subdomains in FnbpA and FnbpB are hydrophilic, and proteolytic processing of FnbpA has been reported (30McGavin M.J. Zahradka C. Rice K. Scott J.E. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2621-2628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a SLAVA motif is not present in either of these MSCRAMMs. Also, in the CNA A-region we can identify three subdomains, and the recombinant A-region behaves as a nonglobular extended protein (3Rich R.L. Demeler B. Ashby K. Deivanayagam C.C. Petrich J.W. Patti J.M. Narayana S.V. Hook M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15423-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the N1 subdomain is less hydrophilic compared with this domain in other members of this protein family, and no partial processing has been observed. Furthermore, the ligand (collagen) binding site is functional in an isolated N2 subdomain of CNA (31Patti J.M. Boles J.O. Hook M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11428-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations point to a common structural subdomain organization of the A-regions of these proteins.The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the recombinant putative subdomains of ClfB supports the proposed multidomain hypothesis for the A-regions. However, the ultimate proof of this hypothesis will come from a structural analysis of these proteins. We are currently involved in trying to solve the crystal structures of several MSCRAMMs. As additional structural information becomes available, we will undoubtedly refine our understanding of the organization and mechanism of action of these important proteins. ClfB is a member of a family of structurally related surface proteins present on S. aureus cells that currently includes seven additional members: ClfA, FnbpA, FnbpB, SdrC, SdrD, SdrE, and CNA. These proteins are all of similar size (molecular mass ∼100,000 Da) and contain at the C terminus structural features required for cell wall anchoring including an LPXTG sequence recognized by the transpeptidase sortase, a hydrophobic domain that may span the membrane, and a short cytoplasmic tail composed primarily of positively charged residues. Although the amino acid sequences immediately outside the cell wall anchoring domain vary substantially among the different members, some specific regions are found in several proteins, and smaller subgroups can be defined within the family based on these shared regions (for a review, see Ref. 2Foster T.J. Hook M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal halves of all of the proteins, called the A-region, are similar in size and composed of significantly similar amino acid sequences. Furthermore, deconvolution of the CD spectra of recombinant versions of these A-regions suggests that they contain a similar composition of secondary structures. We now propose that each of the A-regions are composed of three subdomains that we have called N1, N2, and N3. Using ClfB as a model protein, we have attempted to provide support for this hypothesis. The border between the N1 and N2 subdomains was defined by a proteolytically sensitive SLAVA motif. Furthermore, comparison of amino acid sequence and secondary structure prediction between the minimal collagen-binding motif of CNA and ClfB defines N2. The different subdomains expressed as recombinant proteins have a defined secondary structure composition as shown by CD analysis, and they refold after heat denaturation, suggesting that they could represent individual folding units. Recombinant N2 and N3 behaved on gel permeation chromatography as globular proteins, and it appears likely that these regions represent distinct subdomains. The N1 protein behaves as an extended, nonglobular protein in gel permeation chromatography. Another possibility is that the N1 subdomain forms a dimer, which would account for the larger Stokes radii (RS ) for proteins containing N1 in Table II. However, neither nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis nor analytical ultracentrifugation analysis showed the presence of N1-containing dimers (data not shown). Furthermore, N1 contains a large percentage of hydrophilic amino acid residues, and N1 migrates abnormally under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE. Clearly, the N1 sequence is not a globular structure. However, it is not clear if N1 folds as one subdomain or if N1 is composed of several distinct domains. Although the different putative domains can fold independently, it is clear that at least N2 and N3 interact if they are expressed together, as can be concluded from the denaturation experiments. The recombinant isolated N3 domain denatures at ∼37 °C. However, temperature denaturation of the N23 tandem motif does not reveal any partial unfolding at this low temperature. Instead, the N23 tandem motif remains intact up to ∼50 °C, when it unfolds in apparently one step, indicating that in the N23 tandem motif the structure of N3 is stabilized by the presence of N2. Furthermore, none of the putative subdomains are able to bind fibrinogen when expressed and analyzed individually. However, the N23 tandem motif binds fibrinogen in a specific, concentration-dependent and saturable manner with an apparent KD of 2 × 10−8m. Also, the N12 tandem motif binds fibrinogen but with an apparent lower affinity. Taken together, these results suggest that the protein segment required for forming a fibrinogen-binding site is not contained in an isolated subdomain but that two subdomains (N12 or N23) are needed to form an active protein. This does not imply that sequences from the two subdomains combine to form the actual binding region. It is possible that sequences within a specific subdomain are found in the binding region but that the folding of the subdomain and the formation of an active site are influenced by neighboring sequences. This possibility appears to be supported by the finding that both N12 and N23 bind fibrinogen and that proteolytically processed N23 with an exposed N terminus at residue Ala199 is unable to bind fibrinogen, but when this protein construct contains a short unrelated N-terminal extension it acquires fibrinogen-binding activity. These observations also suggest that the N2 subdomain plays a key role in fibrinogen binding. In apparent support of this hypothesis, we found that antibodies raised against the N2 subdomain were the most efficient in inhibiting the binding of ClfB-mediated adherence to fibrinogen, although antibodies to both the N3 and the N1 subdomains also had some inhibitory activity. The proteolytic processing of ClfB, which results in the removal of the N1 domain, occurs both on intact S. aureus cells (8Nı́ Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Hook M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and during the isolation of recombinant A-region produced in E. coli (15McAleese F.M. Walsh E.J. Sieprawska M. Potempa J. Foster T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29969-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In both cases, the protease is a metalloprotease, and this processing can be largely prevented by the addition of EDTA. The N1 segment does not appear to be released as an intact subdomain, but a set of shorter peptides can be detected from the processing of the recombinant protein. 2S. Perkins, E. J. Walsh, C. C. S. Deivanayagam, S. V. L. Narayana, T. J. Foster, and M. Höök, unpublished observation. This observation supports the idea that N1 is not a tightly packed globular subdomain but contains many sites that are susceptible to proteolytic attack. The biological implications of an MSCRAMM composed of several subdomains, which may be proteolytically processed, are unclear. A regulated processing of N1 could greatly affect the fibrinogen binding activity of the remaining N23 domains of ClfB. Thus, a recombinant N23 appears to bind fibrinogen with a higher affinity compared with that observed with the intact A-region. A partial removal of the N1 subdomain may lead to an activation of fibrinogen-binding activity, whereas a complete removal of the N1 subdomain results in loss of fibrinogen-binding activity, since cleaved N23 does not bind fibrinogen. Does the proposed model of the subunit organization and processing of the ClfB A-region also apply to other structurally related proteins onS. aureus? We believe that the ClfA A-region is very similar to the ClfB A-region. The minimal fibrinogen-binding activity is located within a subregion composed of the N23 tandem motif. The putative N1 subdomain is hydrophilic and readily processed (7McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol.

It is capable of infecting both nonprofessional and professional phagocytic cells. The invasion process can be divided into two steps: attachment to the host cell membrane, followed by internalization. Once internalized, the bacterium rapidly lyses the phagocytic vacuole, liberating it into the cytosol. The bacterium quickly starts coating itself with actin filaments, propelling it through the cytosol where it is able to invaginate the plasma membrane of neighboring cell, thus avoiding the immune response (reviewed in Refs. 1Dramsi S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Two proteins, internalin A (InlA)1 and internalin B (InlB), have been found to be crucial in mediating the internalization of Listeria into nonprofessional phagocytes (2Ireton K. Cossart P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the different characteristics of each protein determines the efficiency of internalization into specific cell types (4Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).InlB is a 630-amino acid protein consisting of eight leucine-rich repeats, each comprising 22 amino acids with high homology with those of InlA, an inter-region containing two repeats of ∼70 amino acids, and a 232-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region consisting of tandem repeats each of ∼80 amino acids, which begins with the motif GW (5Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). InlB only loosely associates with the cell surface of Listeria monocytogenes via the GW-containing region and appears to be partly released during infection. It has been shown to confer invasiveness to latex beads and noninvasive Listeria species when surface-associated (6Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal leucine-rich repeats are critical for entry (8Braun L. Nato F. Payrastre B. Mazie J.-C. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Its structure has been recently elucidated (9Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).Entry of L. monocytogenes is an active process, and part of the mechanism involves activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, because entry is blocked by chemical and genetic inhibition of this enzyme (10Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). InlB appears to be responsible for PI 3-kinase activation and also induces the recruitment of the mammalian adaptor proteins Shc, Cbl, and Gab-1. Gab-1 in turn has been shown to recruit the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The first receptor described for InlB, gC1q-R, is one of the receptors for the complement protein C1q (12Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It does not contain a transmembrane region or glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage sequence. This would suggest that gC1q-R is acting as a co-receptor for a transmembrane signaling protein capable of initiating signal transduction. A possible candidate has been described by Shen et al. (13Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that c-Met, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), or “scatter factor,” can bind InlB. Similar to InlB, HGF has been shown to activate PI 3-kinase, and InlB can induce epithelial cell scattering. Both InlB (14Mansell A. Braun L. Cossart P. O'Neill L.A.J. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and HGF (15Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeler C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) also activate the transcription factor NF-κB. For InlB, this may be a host defense response, because NF-κB regulates the expression of many inflammatory genes. Alternatively, NF-κB activation by InlB may be a mechanism whereby L. monocytogenes inhibits apoptosis in infected cells, because of the anti-apoptotic effect of NF-κB (16Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 17LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 19: 3247-3259Google Scholar, 18Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar).We have shown that the mechanism of NF-κB activation by InlB in J774 macrophages involves PI 3-kinase (14Mansell A. Braun L. Cossart P. O'Neill L.A.J. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we have found that, similar to HGF, InlB activates the low molecular weight G-protein Ras. PI 3-kinase activation occurs downstream of Ras and leads to the activation of Akt. Our study therefore identifies signaling processes initiated by InlB, which are involved in NF-κB activation.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have analyzed the signaling pathway activated by the L. monocytogenes protein InlB, which culminates with the activation of NF-κB. InlB had been shown previously to activate PI 3-kinase (10Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a response required for internalization of L. monocytogenes (7Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that in J774 macrophages the activation of PI 3-kinase occurs downstream of Ras activation, and that Akt is activated following PI 3-kinase. Our results are the first demonstration of a bacterial protein utilizing Ras, PI 3-kinase, and Akt as signaling mediators that result in NF-κB activation and suggests that PI 3-kinase-mediated internalization may require Ras.During the course of this research, it was demonstrated that c-Met, the heterodimeric receptor for HGF, was the mammalian receptor for InlB (13Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 33Cossart P. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 105-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first reported receptor for InlB was gC1q-R (12Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), a protein that binds the complement protein C1q. This protein lacks a transmembrane domain and also lacks an identifiable cytoplasmic region. Its role in InlB signal transduction remains unclear, although it is possible that it interacts with Met. The identification of Met as a receptor for InlB provides a molecular explanation for previously reported InlB signals. These signals include recruitment of Gab-1 and Cbl to phosphotyrosines. The binding of HGF to Met triggers dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptor, instigating recruitment of adaptor proteins, and initiating several different signaling pathways, including recruitment of Gab-1, Cbl, p85, and Grb-2, this last signal leading to Ras activation (34Birchmeier C. Gherardi E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 35Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), although the post-receptor signals involved are yet to be determined. Our finding that InlB activates NF-κB via Ras and Akt adds two further common signals to the list mediated by InlB and HGF, further strengthening the role of Met in InlB signal transduction.Our data suggest that Ras is required for PI 3-kinase activation, as indicated by the inhibitory effect of manumycin A on p85 recruitment. Ireton et al. (11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that InlB induces the formation of Gab-1.p85 complexes in Vero cells. This may be another means of activating PI 3-kinase. Ras, however, may not play a role in this response in the cells.It has been suggested that Ras activation of PI 3-kinase is required for optimal response to growth factors, where Ras-GTP activation combined with recruitment of p85 to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues on growth factor receptors synergize to give full activation of PI 3-kinase (37Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 38Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Our finding that Ras acts upstream of PI 3-kinase, combined with the Ireton et al. findings (11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) of Gab-1·p85 complex recruitment to InlB-mediated phosphotyrosines, suggests that this interaction could be involved in this response.Our study also demonstrates that, for Ras, PI 3-kinase and the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, Akt, are involved in the pathway for NF-κB activation. Akt has been shown to activate the IκB kinase complex by inducing the phosphorylation of IKKα at threonine position 23 (Thr-23) (30Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), a site claimed to be essential for IKK activation (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). This action causes the phosphorylation of IκB, leading to the release of NF-κB. This pathway may mediate the effect of InlB here. The role of Akt in the activation of the IKK complex is controversial, however, and may be cell type-specific. Akt has been shown to promote transactivation by the p65 subunit of NF-κB (40Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 41Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), thus allowing gene transcription. This process also occurs downstream of Ras. Our data would suggest that Akt might be having a direct effect upon IKK, as inhibition of Ras and PI 3-kinase by specific inhibitors blocked IκBα degradation. A dominant negative mutant of Akt also blocked NF-κB-driven gene transcription, possibly pointing to a role in the pathway of transactivation.Our evidence that Ras, PI 3-kinase, and Akt are required for NF-κB activation, was supported by data demonstrating that dominant negative Ras N17, LY294002 and dominant negative Akt blocked induction of a reporter gene luciferase, linked to the IL-8 promoter, which is NF-κB-dependent. The stimulation of the promoter by InlB, although weak, was consistently observed, and the signaling inhibitors consistently blocked induction. The basis for the weakness in the response is not clear. To confirm this result, we measured IL-8 protein production. This gave a much stronger response to InlB. We again tested LY294002 in the response and found it to be inhibitory. We were unable to test dominant negative mutants in this assay, because it is not transfection-based, and Hep2 cells are not transfectable to a high enough efficiency to ensure that enough cells in the population would be susceptible to inhibition. Therefore, we again tested the Ras inhibitor manumycin A and a newly described inhibitor of Akt. Both abolished the effect of InlB on IL-8 production, confirming the result obtained in the IL-8 promoter assay, and providing additional support for Ras and Akt as possible signal transducers for InlB.Activation of NF-κB by InlB may be part of the host defense response, given that we have shown that InlB induces NF-κB-dependent inflammatory cytokine expression. However, InlB may also be promoting an anti-apoptotic response required for survival of L. monocytogenes-infected cells. This response may require Akt, which, along with being involved in NF-κB activation, is also involved in phosphorylation and the inactivation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and pro-caspase 9 (22Marte B.M.

Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar). The effect of Akt on NF-κB has been shown to render cells partially resistant to the pro-apoptotic effects of etoposide (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), supporting a role for Akt/NF-κB in any anti-apoptotic response to L. monocytogenes.In conclusion, our results identify Ras and Akt as novel signals activated by InlB, which are required for NF-κB activation, with Ras acting upstream of PI 3-kinase. Whether Ras and Akt are also required for InlB-mediated internalization of L. monocytogenes is under investigation, although, given that PI 3-kinase is required for this process, there is a strong possibility that this will be the case. These results concur with Met as the receptor for InlB and elucidate a pathway important for the interaction between this bacterium and the host cell. Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, food-borne, intracellular bacterium that causes meningitis, septicaemia, abortion, and peritoneal infections. It is capable of infecting both nonprofessional and professional phagocytic cells. The invasion process can be divided into two steps: attachment to the host cell membrane, followed by internalization. Once internalized, the bacterium rapidly lyses the phagocytic vacuole, liberating it into the cytosol. The bacterium quickly starts coating itself with actin filaments, propelling it through the cytosol where it is able to invaginate the plasma membrane of neighboring cell, thus avoiding the immune response (reviewed in Refs. 1Dramsi S. Lebrun M. Cossart P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 209: 61-77PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ireton K. Cossart P. Annu. Rev.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Two proteins, internalin A (InlA)1 and internalin B (InlB), have been found to be crucial in mediating the internalization of Listeria into nonprofessional phagocytes (2Ireton K. Cossart P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the different characteristics of each protein determines the efficiency of internalization into specific cell types (4Cossart P. Lecuit M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3797-3806Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). InlB is a 630-amino acid protein consisting of eight leucine-rich repeats, each comprising 22 amino acids with high homology with those of InlA, an inter-region containing two repeats of ∼70 amino acids, and a 232-amino acid carboxyl-terminal region consisting of tandem repeats each of ∼80 amino acids, which begins with the motif GW (5Dramsi S. Biswas I. Maguin E. Braun L. Mastroeni P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 251-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). InlB only loosely associates with the cell surface of Listeria monocytogenes via the GW-containing region and appears to be partly released during infection. It has been shown to confer invasiveness to latex beads and noninvasive Listeria species when surface-associated (6Braun L. Dramsi S. Dehoux P. Bierne H. Lindahl G. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal leucine-rich repeats are critical for entry (8Braun L. Nato F. Payrastre B. Mazie J.-C. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Its structure has been recently elucidated (9Marino M. Braun L. Cossart P. Ghosh P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Entry of L. monocytogenes is an active process, and part of the mechanism involves activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase, because entry is blocked by chemical and genetic inhibition of this enzyme (10Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). InlB appears to be responsible for PI 3-kinase activation and also induces the recruitment of the mammalian adaptor proteins Shc, Cbl, and Gab-1. Gab-1 in turn has been shown to recruit the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The first receptor described for InlB, gC1q-R, is one of the receptors for the complement protein C1q (12Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). It does not contain a transmembrane region or glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage sequence. This would suggest that gC1q-R is acting as a co-receptor for a transmembrane signaling protein capable of initiating signal transduction. A possible candidate has been described by Shen et al. (13Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that c-Met, the tyrosine kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), or “scatter factor,” can bind InlB. Similar to InlB, HGF has been shown to activate PI 3-kinase, and InlB can induce epithelial cell scattering. Both InlB (14Mansell A. Braun L. Cossart P. O'Neill L.A.J. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and HGF (15Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeler C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) also activate the transcription factor NF-κB. For InlB, this may be a host defense response, because NF-κB regulates the expression of many inflammatory genes. Alternatively, NF-κB activation by InlB may be a mechanism whereby L. monocytogenes inhibits apoptosis in infected cells, because of the anti-apoptotic effect of NF-κB (16Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar, 17LaCasse E.C. Baird S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 19: 3247-3259Google Scholar, 18Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We have shown that the mechanism of NF-κB activation by InlB in J774 macrophages involves PI 3-kinase (14Mansell A. Braun L. Cossart P. O'Neill L.A.J. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we have found that, similar to HGF, InlB activates the low molecular weight G-protein Ras. PI 3-kinase activation occurs downstream of Ras and leads to the activation of Akt. Our study therefore identifies signaling processes initiated by InlB, which are involved in NF-κB activation. DISCUSSIONIn this study we have analyzed the signaling pathway activated by the L. monocytogenes protein InlB, which culminates with the activation of NF-κB. InlB had been shown previously to activate PI 3-kinase (10Ireton K. Payrastre B. Chap H. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Kasuga M. Cossart P. Science. 1996; 274: 780-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a response required for internalization of L. monocytogenes (7Braun L. Ohayon H. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that in J774 macrophages the activation of PI 3-kinase occurs downstream of Ras activation, and that Akt is activated following PI 3-kinase. Our results are the first demonstration of a bacterial protein utilizing Ras, PI 3-kinase, and Akt as signaling mediators that result in NF-κB activation and suggests that PI 3-kinase-mediated internalization may require Ras.During the course of this research, it was demonstrated that c-Met, the heterodimeric receptor for HGF, was the mammalian receptor for InlB (13Shen Y. Naujokas M. Park M. Ireton K. Cell. 2000; 103: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 33Cossart P. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 105-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The first reported receptor for InlB was gC1q-R (12Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), a protein that binds the complement protein C1q. This protein lacks a transmembrane domain and also lacks an identifiable cytoplasmic region. Its role in InlB signal transduction remains unclear, although it is possible that it interacts with Met. The identification of Met as a receptor for InlB provides a molecular explanation for previously reported InlB signals. These signals include recruitment of Gab-1 and Cbl to phosphotyrosines. The binding of HGF to Met triggers dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptor, instigating recruitment of adaptor proteins, and initiating several different signaling pathways, including recruitment of Gab-1, Cbl, p85, and Grb-2, this last signal leading to Ras activation (34Birchmeier C. Gherardi E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 404-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 35Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4600-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). HGF also activates NF-κB (15Schmidt C. Bladt F. Goedecke S. Brinkmann V. Zschiesche W. Sharpe M. Gherardi E. Birchmeler C. Nature. 1995; 373: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), although the post-receptor signals involved are yet to be determined. Our finding that InlB activates NF-κB via Ras and Akt adds two further common signals to the list mediated by InlB and HGF, further strengthening the role of Met in InlB signal transduction.Our data suggest that Ras is required for PI 3-kinase activation, as indicated by the inhibitory effect of manumycin A on p85 recruitment. Ireton et al. (11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that InlB induces the formation of Gab-1.p85 complexes in Vero cells. This may be another means of activating PI 3-kinase. Ras, however, may not play a role in this response in the cells.It has been suggested that Ras activation of PI 3-kinase is required for optimal response to growth factors, where Ras-GTP activation combined with recruitment of p85 to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues on growth factor receptors synergize to give full activation of PI 3-kinase (37Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 38Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Our finding that Ras acts upstream of PI 3-kinase, combined with the Ireton et al. findings (11Ireton K. Payrastre B. Cossart P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) of Gab-1·p85 complex recruitment to InlB-mediated phosphotyrosines, suggests that this interaction could be involved in this response.Our study also demonstrates that, for Ras, PI 3-kinase and the downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, Akt, are involved in the pathway for NF-κB activation. Akt has been shown to activate the IκB kinase complex by inducing the phosphorylation of IKKα at threonine position 23 (Thr-23) (30Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar), a site claimed to be essential for IKK activation (39Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). This action causes the phosphorylation of IκB, leading to the release of NF-κB. This pathway may mediate the effect of InlB here. The role of Akt in the activation of the IKK complex is controversial, however, and may be cell type-specific. Akt has been shown to promote transactivation by the p65 subunit of NF-κB (40Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 41Madrid L.V. Mayo M.W. Reuther J.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18934-18940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), thus allowing gene transcription. This process also occurs downstream of Ras. Our data would suggest that Akt might be having a direct effect upon IKK, as inhibition of Ras and PI 3-kinase by specific inhibitors blocked IκBα degradation. A dominant negative mutant of Akt also blocked NF-κB-driven gene transcription, possibly pointing to a role in the pathway of transactivation.Our evidence that Ras, PI 3-kinase, and Akt are required for NF-κB activation, was supported by data demonstrating that dominant negative Ras N17, LY294002 and dominant negative Akt blocked induction of a reporter gene luciferase, linked to the IL-8 promoter, which is NF-κB-dependent. The stimulation of the promoter by InlB, although weak, was consistently observed, and the signaling inhibitors consistently blocked induction. The basis for the weakness in the response is not clear. To confirm this result, we measured IL-8 protein production. This gave a much stronger response to InlB. We again tested LY294002 in the response and found it to be inhibitory. We were unable to test dominant negative mutants in this assay, because it is not transfection-based, and Hep2 cells are not transfectable to a high enough efficiency to ensure that enough cells in the population would be susceptible to inhibition. Therefore, we again tested the Ras inhibitor manumycin A and a newly described inhibitor of Akt. Both abolished the effect of InlB on IL-8 production, confirming the result obtained in the IL-8 promoter assay, and providing additional support for Ras and Akt as possible signal transducers for InlB.Activation of NF-κB by InlB may be part of the host defense response, given that we have shown that InlB induces NF-κB-dependent inflammatory cytokine expression. However, InlB may also be promoting an anti-apoptotic response required for survival of L. monocytogenes-infected cells.

https://openalex.org/W1993796423,"Insulin stimulates glucose transport in adipocytes and muscle cells by triggering redistribution of the GLUT4 glucose transporter from an intracellular perinuclear location to the cell surface. Recent reports have shown that the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport, implicating an important role for microtubules in this process. In the present study we show that 2 μm nocodazole completely depolymerized microtubules in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as determined morphologically and biochemically, resulting in dispersal of the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment and the Golgi apparatus. However, 2 μm nocodazole did not significantly effect either the kinetics or magnitude of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Consistent with previous studies, higher concentrations of nocodazole (10–33 μm) significantly inhibited basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. This effect was not likely the result of microtubule depolymerization because in the presence of taxol, which blocked nocodazole-induced depolymerization of microtubules as well as the dispersal of the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment, the inhibitory effect of 10–33 μm nocodazole on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake prevailed. Despite the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport with 33 μm nocodazole we did not observe inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface under these conditions. Consistent with a direct effect of nocodazole on glucose transporter function we observed a rapid inhibitory effect of nocodazole on glucose transport activity when added to either 3T3-L1 adipocytes or to Chinese hamster ovary cells at 4 °C. These studies reveal a new and unexpected effect of nocodazole in mammalian cells which appears to occur independently of its microtubule-depolymerizing effects.

In the absence of insulin GLUT4, the major glucose transporter isoform expressed in these cells, is stored in an intracellular tubulovesicular compartment. Insulin stimulates the exocytosis of GLUT4 from this compartment, leading to increased GLUT4 levels at the cell surface. This process occurs with a t1/2 of 2–5 min. Several recent studies have suggested an important role for microtubules in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking. First, tubulin-α and vimentin have been identified as major components of intracellular GLUT4 vesicles in adipocytes (5Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R. Theurkauf W.E. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38151-38159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Second, it has been shown that insulin stimulates the long range movement of GLUT4 vesicles along linear tracks in adipocytes (6Fletcher L.M. Welsh G.I. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Third, the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes (7Patki V.

Finally, nocodazole caused a dispersal of the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment in adipocytes (7Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol.

These studies have led to the notion that microtubules may play a fundamental role in GLUT4 trafficking and insulin action. It has been proposed that insulin may stimulate GLUT4 exocytosis, at least in part, by increasing the rate of association of GLUT4-containing membranes with microtubules. This step likely occurs in the perinuclear region of the cell, implicating an important role for the perinuclear localization of GLUT4 in insulin action (5Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S.

In the present studies we have examined the dose response effects of nocodazole on microtubule integrity and insulin action in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Using morphological and biochemical methods we observed maximal effects of nocodazole on microtubule depolymerization at a concentration of 2 μm. Functional consequences of microtubule depolymerization were observed at 2 μmnocodazole in that the Golgi apparatus and the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell. Despite these effects there was no significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport or GLUT4 translocation at 2 μm nocodazole. At higher nocodazole concentrations (10–33 μm) we observed inhibition of glucose transport consistent with previous studies (7Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol.

We present data to show that the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of nocodazole are the result of an inhibitory effect of the drug on glucose transport activity rather than on the insulin-dependent recruitment of GLUT4 to the cell surface. We conclude that nocodazole does not inhibit insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. All tissue culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., except fetal calf serum, which was obtained from Trace Biosciences (Clayton, Australia). Insulin, nocodazole, and taxol were obtained from Calbiochem. Bicinchoninic acid reagent, used in protein assays, and ECL Supersignal reagent were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL). BSA1 was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membranes were obtained from Millipore Corp. (Beldford, MA). Unless specified, all other reagents were from Sigma. The GLUT4 polyclonal antibody (R017) was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids of rat GLUT4. Monoclonal vimentin antibody, V9.5, was a gift from Dr. Robert M. Evans (Department of Pathology, University of Colorado, Denver). Monoclonal anti-tubulin-α antibody (DM1A) was from Sigma, and monoclonal anti-HA (16B12) was purchased from BabCO (Richmond, CA). Phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate and all of the fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Little Chafton, U. K.). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (10Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured as described previously (11Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 116 (HA-GLUT4) 3T3-L1 adipocytes were obtained by transfection of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with the retroviral expression vector pBabepuro containing GLUT4 HA-tagged at the extracellular loop, as described by Shewan et al. (12Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were infected with the relevant virus for 3–5 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After a 48-h recovery period, infected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum supplemented with 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and then differentiated as described above. Cells cultured in 6- or 12-well plates were serum starved in KRP buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMg SO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in 950 μl of KRP buffer with the corresponding agents at the times and doses indicated in the figure legends. 2-Deoxy-[3H]glucose (2-DOG) uptake was measured as described previously (13Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 1 mm 2-DOG (20 μCi/mmol). After 4 min, the assay was terminated by washing the cells rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were subsequently solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, and 3H was quantified by scintillation counting (Packard 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer, Packard Instrument Co.). Nonspecific 2-DOG uptake was determined in the presence of 50 μm cytochalasin B. Cells cultured on coverslips in 6- or 12-well dishes were starved for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% BSA or in KRP buffer containing 0.2% BSA buffer and incubated with the appropriate treatments. Cells were fixed with acetone for 5 min, washed with PBS, washed again with PBS containing 0.15 m in glycine, and incubated with 1% BSA containing PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies and diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and incubated for 30 min with phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate or with the corresponding Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA. Normal rabbit serum was used as a negative control. Coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted onto glass microscope slides, and viewed using an X63/1.4 Zeiss oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope, equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal imaging system. In experiments designed for staining of cytoskeletal structures, cells were fixed and permeabilized simultaneously in cytoskeleton-stabilizing buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) as described by Arcangeletti et al. (14Arcangeletti C. Sutterlin R. Uebi U. De Conto F. Missorini S. Chezzi C. Scherrer K. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 119: 35-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The preparation of plasma membrane (PM) lawns was performed as described by Robinson et al. (15Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubating cells on coverslips with the appropriate treatment, adipocytes were sonicated yielding a lawn of PM fragments attached to the coverslip. Coverslips were then incubated with the relevant antibodies followed by Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody. The fluorescence intensity of individual PM fragments (100) from five random fields for each experimental condition was quantified using NIH 1.62 software. The assay and quantitation were performed by separate investigators in a double blind fashion. In addition, parallel experiments measuring tubulin depolymerization and glucose transport were performed. In experiments designed for cell surface staining, 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing HA-tagged GLUT4 (12Shewan A.M. Marsh B.J. Melvin D.R. Martin S. Gould G.W. James D.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min but not permeabilized. Cells were incubated with the anti-HA antibody for 1 h, washed, and incubated with the corresponding Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody, as described above, and visualized using an X63/1.4 Zeiss oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence microscope, equipped with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 laser confocal imaging system. In some cases we also quantified surface labeling using a colorimetric detection assay as previously described (16Whitehead J.P. Molero J.C. Clark S.F. Martin S. Meneilly G. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27816-27824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes expressing HA-GLUT4 were grown in 24-well plates. Following the appropriate treatment cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Cells were incubated with 2.5% normal swine serum and PBS for 30 min then incubated with anti-HA antibody in 1% normal swine serum in PBS or in 1% normal swine serum in PBS alone as a control for 60 min. After washing in 0.1% BSA in PBS (3 × 10 min) cells were incubated with anti-mouse:horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:5,000) in 2.5% normal rat serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times for 10 min each in PBS followed by incubation in o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride reagent, made up according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) for 30 min in the dark. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 450 nm. Polymerized tubulin was extracted from 3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured on 10-cm dishes as described previously (17Breitfeld P.P. McKinnin W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were serum starved for 2 h by incubation in the presence of KRP buffer containing 0.2% BSA prior to different treatments. At the conclusion of the treatment period, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 1 ml of Triton X-100 extraction buffer (2 mglycerol, 0.1 m PIPES, pH 7.1, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 37 °C. The supernatant, containing the nonpolymerized tubulin, was discarded. One ml of SDS buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.5% SDS) was added to the dish for 5 min at 37 °C to solubilize the remaining Triton X-100-insoluble protein containing polymerized tubulin. 20-μg aliquots of the Triton X-100-insoluble protein was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) and transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted using a specific anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (DM1A) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using Supersignal reagent. Autoradiograms were quantified using a model GS-670 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad). Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Plot software. Statistical significance was established by Student’s t test (p < 0.05). Treatment of adipocytes with 0.2 μm nocodazole for 1 h decreased the amount of polymerized tubulin by 65%, and a maximal effect of nocodazole (>95% depolymerization) was observed at a nocodazole concentration of 2 μm (Fig. 1). Time course experiments revealed that these effects were rapid, occurring within 15 min of treatment (data not shown). Even though we observed a maximal effect of nocodazole on microtubule depolymerization at a concentration of 2 μm we observed no significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport or GLUT4 translocation under the same experimental conditions. Studies examining the effects of nocodazole on microtubules frequently use this drug at concentrations >10 μm. At a concentration of 33 μm, nocodazole caused an 80% decrease in insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 1), consistent with previous reports (7Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Basal 2-DOG uptake was also inhibited significantly in the presence of 33 μmnocodazole (∼75%). Basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport were completely restored after removal of nocodazole from the culture medium (data not shown), ruling out possible cytotoxic effects of the drug. To confirm the dose response effects of nocodazole on the integrity of microtubules in 3T3-L1 adipocytes we performed immunofluorescence microscopy on 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an anti-tubulin antibody. In the absence of nocodazole we observed an elaborate microtubule network in adipocytes. Microtubules radiated from the microtubule-organizing center to the cell periphery where they formed a tight cortical network (Fig. 2 a). After incubation of adipocytes with 2 μm nocodazole microtubules were completely absent (Fig. 2 b), corroborating the biochemical data (Fig. 1). Treatment with 2 μm nocodazole also promoted reorganization of vimentin-containing intermediate filaments into thick bundles localized beneath the PM and encapsulating the lipid droplets (Fig. 2, c versus d). The actin-based microfilaments, which presented as a cortical rim underlying the PM, were unaffected by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 2,e and f). Comparable results were achieved when cells were incubated with higher concentrations (10–33 μm) of nocodazole (data not shown). We next examined the effects of 2 μm nocodazole on the localization of GLUT4 in basal and insulin-stimulated adipocytes using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Insulin induced the translocation of GLUT4 from a perinuclear location to the cell surface (Fig.3, basal versus ins). Treatment with 2 μm nocodazole resulted in complete dispersal of the GLUT4 perinuclear compartment throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, basal versus noc). Nocodazole (2 μm) had no apparent effect on insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the PM (Fig. 3, ins versus noc+ins), consistent with the glucose transport data presented above (Fig. 1). These data suggest that an intact GLUT4 perinuclear compartment is not required for efficient insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. One possibility that has been proposed (7Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) is that microtubules regulate the movement of GLUT4 from its perinuclear compartment to the cell cortex whereupon they may be escorted to the surface membrane by actin filaments. Microtubule depolymerization may therefore affect the kinetics but not the magnitude of GLUT4 delivery to the cell surface. Extensive time course experiments were performed to look at both GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in the presence of 2 μm nocodazole. As shown in Fig. 4, we were unable to observe any significant change in the kinetics of either insulin-stimulated glucose transport or GLUT4 translocation to the PM in response to nocodazole.Figure 4Nocodazole does not affect the kinetics of insulin-stimulated glucose transport or GLUT4 translocation.3T3-L1 adipocytes were brought to basal conditions in KRP buffer containing 0.2% BSA buffer and then incubated in the absence (filled circles) or presence (open circles) of 2 μm nocodazole (noc) for 1 h. 100 nm insulin (ins) was added for various periods of time as indicated after which either 2-DOG uptake (A) or GLUT4 translocation (B and C) was measured. 2-DOG uptake was measured at 4 °C to avoid changes in GLUT4 translocation during the actual transport assay. GLUT4 translocation was measured using the PM lawn assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In B representative fields of PM lawns from different time points are shown. Fluorescence associated with individual PM fragments was quantified (C). Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One possibility to explain the dose response effects of nocodazole on glucose transport (Fig. 1) is that at high doses nocodazole may inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport via a microtubule-independent effect. To test this hypothesis we employed the anti-tumor agent taxol, which stabilizes microtubules (19Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We reasoned that taxol may prevent any effects of nocodazole arising from microtubule depolymerization but not indirect effects of the drug. Treatment of adipocytes with 40 μm taxol for 1 h promoted an increase in the level of polymerized tubulin (Fig.5 A). Moreover, taxol completely prevented the depolymerization of microtubules observed following incubation of cells with 33 μm nocodazole. The presence of an intact microtubule network in cells treated simultaneously with 33 μm nocodazole and 40 μm taxol was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown). To confirm that taxol restored the function of the microtubule network we examined the localization of GLUT4 as well as two Golgi markers, syntaxin 6 and GS-15. As indicated in Fig. 5 B, taxol completely prevented the nocodazole-induced redistribution of GLUT4 from its perinuclear location. Similar results were obtained for both syntaxin 6, a trans-Golgi network marker (20Bock J.B. Klumperman J. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and GS-15, a protein present in the Golgi apparatus (21Xu Y. Wong S.H. Zhang T. Subramaniam V.M. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20162-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We next examined the effects of taxol on 2-DOG uptake in adipocytes. Taxol alone had no significant effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 5 C) or GLUT4 translocation (data not shown). However, taxol was unable to overcome the inhibitory effect of 33 μm nocodazole on basal or insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 5 C). Even though 33 μm nocodazole inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport by 80%, we were unable to detect any significant decrease in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in the presence of high doses of nocodazole, as measured by the PM lawn assay (Fig.6, A and B). Moreover, the movement of GLUT4 to the cell surface in the presence of 33 μm nocodazole resulted in its productive fusion with the PM (Fig. 6, C and D), as determined by surface labeling of a GLUT4 construct bearing an HA epitope in one of its exofacial domains (22Quon M.J. Guerre-Milo M. Zarnowski M.J. Butte A.J. Em M. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The most likely explanation for these data is that nocodazole somehow impairs the transport properties of GLUT4 after it has fused with the PM. To test this hypothesis we performed two separate experiments. First, we examined the reversal of nocodazole treatment on glucose transport under conditions in which membrane trafficking was inhibited (i.e. at 4 °C). Cells were pretreated with 33 μm nocodazole for 1 h, and insulin was added during the last 15 min. The cells were cooled rapidly to 4 °C to immobilize GLUT4 at the cell surface, by washing with ice-cold KRP/BSA buffer in the presence or absence of 33 μm nocodazole. After a 5-min incubation at 4 °C, 2-DOG uptake was measured. As shown in Fig. 7 A, when 2-DOG uptake was measured at 4 °C the stimulatory effect of insulin was maintained. Similarly, the inhibitory effects of 33 μm nocodazole on glucose transport were also maintained when 2-DOG assays were performed at 4 °C. In contrast, when nocodazole was withdrawn during the 5-min incubation at 4 °C there was a dramatic reversal in insulin-dependent glucose transport approaching values observed in control cells. These data provide further evidence that nocodazole does not interfere with trafficking of GLUT4 but somehow impairs the activity properties of the transporter itself. The second experiment that we performed was to determine whether nocodazole could inhibit glucose transport after the translocation process was complete. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were stimulated with insulin for 15 min at 37 °C to promote translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Cells were then cooled rapidly to 4 °C, to prevent further trafficking, and then incubated with nocodazole on ice for 30 min prior to measurement of 2-DOG uptake, which was also performed at 4 °C. The low dose of nocodazole (2 μm) had no significant effect on glucose transport when added at 4 °C, whereas the high dose of nocodazole (33 μm) resulted in >80% inhibition of insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake (Fig. 7 B). Similar effects of 33 μm nocodazole were also observed after a 2-min incubation with the drug at 4 °C, suggesting that this inhibitory effect was rapid (data not shown). As a control for these experiments we also examined the effects of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, at 4 °C. Although this drug inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport when added prior to insulin treatment at 37 °C we observed no inhibitory effect on insulin action when it was added after insulin at 4 °C (Fig.7 B). To determine whether the inhibition of glucose transport by nocodazole was specific to GLUT4 or common to other facilitative glucose transporters we examined the effects of nocodazole on glucose uptake in CHO cells, which only express the GLUT1 isoform (23Piper R.C. Tai C. Slot J.W. Hahn C.S. Rice C.M. Huang H. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Treatment of CHO cells with 33 μm nocodazole at ≤ 4 °C inhibited 2-DOG uptake by 60% (Fig. 7 C). These data indicate that nocodazole inhibits glucose uptake by both GLUT4 and GLUT1 transporters in a rapid, dose-dependent manner, which is independent of effects on signaling or trafficking. Nocodazole is frequently used by cell biologists to examine the role of microtubules in vesicle transport. Although causing complete fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, nocodazole has limited effects on vesicle transport between the Golgi and the cell surface and on endosomal recycling. Nocodazole has little effect on recycling of the transferrin receptor (24Jin M. Snider M.D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nocodazole perturbs membrane traffic between early endosomes and lysosomes (26Mallet W.G. Maxfield F.R.

Cell. 1999; 10: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Similar results have been observed using alternate strategies to disrupt microtubule function. For example, overexpression of dynamitin mutants, which disrupt the function of microtubule motors, also perturbs trafficking to the lysosome, whereas endosomal recycling is unaffected (27Valetti C. Wetzel D.M. Schrader M. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Kreis E. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4107-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have reported that nocodazole inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes (7Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This is of interest because it has been suggested that intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles may represent specialized recycling vesicles (1Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, these effects may be consistent with a unique mode of transport for GLUT4 to the cell surface compared with other recycling proteins such as the transferrin receptor. In the present study we have examined the effects of nocodazole on GLUT4 trafficking and glucose transport in detail. Initially, we studied the dose response effects of nocodazole on microtubule depolymerization and observed maximal effects of the drug at a concentration of 2 μm. At this concentration of nocodazole we observed marked fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment. Despite these effects, the ability of insulin to stimulate GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport was unaffected by nocodazole. Hence, these data suggest that maintenance of the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment is not essential for insulin-mediated traffic to the cell surface (5Guilherme A. Emoto M. Buxton J.M. Bose S. Sabini R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10677-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These observations are perhaps not surprising because this perinuclear compartment of GLUT4 may not represent the major insulin responsive pool (28Martin S. Millar C.A. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Marsh B.J. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous immunoelectron micrographic studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicate that GLUT4 is distributed between the trans-Golgi network and small tubulovesicular elements scattered throughout the cytoplasm (28Martin S. Millar C.A. Lyttle C.T. Meerloo T. Marsh B.J. Gould G.W. James D.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3427-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The trans-Golgi network pool, which likely constitutes the perinuclear labeling typically observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by immunofluorescence microscopy, does not represent the major intracellular insulin-responsive compartment. Although depolymerization of microtubules may not effect the magnitude of the GLUT4 translocation, it is possible that nocodazole may slow the rate of movement of these vesicles to the cell surface, as proposed previously (9Emoto M. Langille S.E. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10677-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility we studied the kinetics of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in the presence of nocodazole. However, we could find no evidence to indicate that the kinetics of GLUT4 translocation or glucose transport activation by insulin was impeded in the presence of nocodazole. The observation that nocodazole had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport was surprising in light of previous studies (7Patki V. Buxton J. Chawla A. Lifshitz L. Fogarty K. Carrington W. Tuft R. Corvera S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in each of these previous studies concentrations of nocodazole in excess of 10 μm were used to study effects on glucose transport. Consistent with these previous studies, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of nocodazole on insulin-stimulated glucose transport (Fig. 1). At 33 μmnocodazole we observed >80% inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. This effect was not likely to be the result of depolymerization of microtubules because at high doses of nocodazole we were able to reverse the microtubule- depolymerizing effects with taxol but not the inhibition of glucose transport (Fig. 5). Strikingly, although nocodazole had a pronounced inhibitory effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport we were unable to detect any inhibitory effect on GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface (Fig. 6). This was not due to an effect of nocodazole on fusion of the GLUT4 vesicles with the PM because we also observed normal GLUT4 translocation using a surface binding assay that only measures transporters that have been incorporated into the PM (Fig. 6,C and D). These results contrast with two other reports in which nocodazole was shown to inhibit GLUT4 translocation, as determined by the PM lawn assay (8Olson A.L. Trumbly A.R. Gibson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10706-10714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 9Emoto M. Langille S.E. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10677-10682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The basis for this discrepancy is not clear. In the present study we have used three different approaches to determine the extent of GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface, and all three methods indicate that nocodazole at either low or high doses does not inhibit this process significantly. In parallel, we observed a dramatic effect of nocodazole on the integrity of microtubules and the perinuclear GLUT4 compartment as well as on cellular glucose transport. Hence, it is unlikely that nocodazole was inactive in our assay systems. The observation that nocodazole inhibited glucose transport independently of translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface argues strongly in favor of a direct effect of this drug on the transport activity of the protein. In support of this hypothesis we observed that nocodazole inhibited glucose transport in adipocytes even when it was added to cells at 4 °C (Fig. 7 B). Under these conditions activation of glucose transport does not rely upon vesicle transport or signal transduction. Furthermore, similar effects were observed in cells that do not express the GLUT4 transporter (Fig. 7 C). Moreover, these inhibitory effects were rapid (Fig. 7 C). The precise nature of this inhibitory effect of nocodazole remains to be defined. However, nocodazole may either bind directly to the transporter, or it may modify the characteristics of the PM thus impairing the normal function of the transporter. The present studies do not exclude the possibility that GLUT4 vesicles are transported along microtubules en route to the PM. However, these studies clearly show that the insulin-dependent recruitment of GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface can occur relatively unimpaired after depolymerization of the microtubule network. Hence, our data suggest that it is unlikely that microtubule-dependent transport is a major rate-limiting step for the insulin-dependent delivery of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Most importantly, these studies reveal an effect of nocodazole, apparently unrelated to its microtubule-depolymerizing effects, to interfere with the transport properties of facilitative glucose transporters. This effect may involve many members of the glucose transport family, and so the use of this drug to study the role of microtubules is probably best confined to low doses where this nonspecific effect does not occur.

We have explored the pathways and nuclear targets of NGF signaling in regulating the NR1 promoter. PD98059 and wortmannin, but not rapamycin, significantly attenuated NGF-induced transcriptional activity from an NR1 promoter-luciferase construct. Coexpressing constitutively active forms of Ras, Raf, or MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) increased promoter activity dramatically. The MEK1-induced increase was largely prevented by mutations of the tandem GC boxes in the promoter. Promoter activity was also increased significantly by coexpressed GC box-binding proteins (Sp1, 3, or 4) in nonstimulated PC12 cells. Either an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK1)- or Sp1-specific antibody coprecipitated Sp1 with ERKs, and the coprecipitation was enhanced significantly by NGF treatment of PC12 cells. ERK2 also incorporated radioactivity of [γ32P]ATP into recombinant Sp1. However, ERK2-treated Sp1 and PC12 nuclear extracts or nuclear extracts from NGF-treated cells exhibited reduced binding to the promoter or a consensus GC box. Our results suggest that NGF utilizes both the Ras/ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways to up-regulate NR1 promoter activity and that Sp1 is a novel substrate of NGF-activated ERKs.

The prototype of this family is nerve growth factor (NGF),1 which interacts with a specific tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA, on the cell surface, triggers multiple intracellular phosphorylation cascades, and alters cellular functions of the nervous system (1Klesse L.J. Parada L.F. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin.

One mechanism underlying NGF effects is an alteration in gene expression at the transcription level. A well defined Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade plays a major role in transducing NGF signals from the membrane to nuclear targets (4Groot M. Boxer L.M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Terminal effectors of this cascade, activated ERK1 and ERK2, are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. They translocate to the nucleus (4Groot M. Boxer L.M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 5Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H.

Transcription factors identified as substrates of MAPK include TCF/Elk-1, ATF/CREB, C/EBPβ, c-Jun, c-Myb, c-Myc, and MEF2(A, C) (3Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev.

Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). Another important pathway of NGF signaling is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade. Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) is the immediate downstream mediator of PI3K and transduces signaling to activation of the pp70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) as well as to inhibition of the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK). The former positively regulates the protein translation machinery, whereas the latter may interact with transcription factors, such as heat shock factor-1 and c-Jun, and negatively regulate gene expression (13Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 14de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Bourouis M. Sassone-Corsi P.

The NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors is a ligand-gated, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel in the central nervous system. NMDA receptors play an important role in brain development, neuronal differentiation, and plasticity (16Choi D.W. Neuron. 1988; 1: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4165) Google Scholar, 17Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar). Among three families of genes encoding the NMDA receptor subunits, genes in NR1 and NR2 families undergo significant up-regulation in the developing brain or differentiating neurons (18Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2819) Google Scholar, 19Pujic Z. Matsumoto I. Wilce P.A. Neurosci.

We reported previously that NGF up-regulated the NR1 promoter in PC12 cells through actions on the tyrosine kinase receptor, TrkA (22Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, an analysis of the minimal promoter sequence responsive to NGF did not reveal any consensus elements for transcription factors previously known to be MAPK substrates. A GSG element is present and recognized by the NGFI/Egr family of transcription factors, whose expression is transiently induced by NGF. Two tandem GC box elements, overlapping the GSG site, in the proximal region of the NR1 promoter were important for basal as well as NGF-regulated activities, suggesting that factors interacting with this region may be nuclear targets of NGF signaling (22Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The GC box is the binding motif for the Sp family of transcription factors, including Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (23Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The prototype of this family, the Sp1 factor, is important for brain development and activation of many genes in the nervous system. Although it shows no tissue specificity, deletion of the Sp1 gene results in failure of brain development in animals (26Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Sp1 protein undergoes post-translational glycosylation and phosphorylation. Sp1 phosphorylation by DNA-dependent kinase does not alter its binding affinity to DNA (27Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation by casein kinase II decreases Sp1 binding at the acetyl-CoA carboxylase promoter, whereas phosphorylation by a putative Sp1 kinase may increase Sp1-related promoter activity of the gastrin promoter and the dihydrofolate reductase promoter in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and serum, respectively (28Zhang S. Kim K.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In terminally differentiated liver cells, casein kinase II phosphorylation was also found to cause a down-regulation of Sp1 activity (29Armstrong S.A. Barry D.A. Leggett R.W. Mueller C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13489-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhibition of Sp1 dephosphorylation may underlie the mechanism of the human immunodeficiency virus gene expression (30Vlach J. Garcia A. Jacque J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Michelson S. Virelizier J.L. Virology. 1995; 208: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interestingly, v-Raf-induced activation of the mdr1 and rep-3bgene promoters, which are serum-inducible, is Sp1-dependent (31Miltenberger R.J. Farnham P.J. Smith D.E. Stommel J.M. Cornwell M.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a Raf cascade activating MAPK is likely to be involved in regulating Sp1 activity. More recent studies of the apolipoprotein A-I (32Zheng X.L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13822-13829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and gastrin promoters (33Merchant J.L. Du M. Todisco A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in non-neuronal tissues suggest that EGF may activate a Ras/ERK cascade that in turn phosphorylates Sp1 and enhances promoter activities. Our previous studies also demonstrated that Sp1 protein interacts with the NR1 promoter directly and has a synergistic effect on promoter activity with an MEF2C factor (34Krainc D. Bai G. Okamoto S.

However, in view of differential effects between NGF and EGF on Ras/ERK activation in nervous cells (35Peraldi P. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as the fact that a number of neuronal genes require GC-rich elements for NGF-induced expression (4Groot M. Boxer L.M. Thiel G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 924-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Kim S.J. Park K. Rudkin B.B. Dey B.R. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigated the postreceptor cascades of NGF signaling leading to activation of the NR1 promoter, potential nuclear targets of the pathways, and possible molecular mechanisms of the phosphorylated target(s) acting on the promoter. We focused on both PI3K and Ras/ERK cascades and nuclear proteins interacting with the GSG/GC box elements. PC12 cells were cultured as described previously (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All NR1 luciferase constructs and stable PC12 cell lines expressing the NR1 luciferase fusion genes have been described (22Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PC12 cell transfectants were cultured at 0.5 × 106 cells/60-mm collagen-coated plate in medium containing serum. In some experiments, serum was removed from cells for 2 h before 100 ng/ml NGF was added for various times. Then, cells were harvested for luciferase assays (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In some experiments, before NGF treatment, cells were pretreated for 15 min with 20 μmPD98059, 200 nm wortmannin, or 27 nm rapamycin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem International, San Diego, CA). The influence of the inhibitors on the nonstimulated promoter-luciferase activity was measured and used to normalize their effects on the NR1 promoter activity stimulated by NGF. Usually, PD98059 caused a slight increase in basal reporter activity. Transient cotransfection of PC12 cells was performed for pNRL356 with Sp or GSK expression constructs at a 1:3 ratio and with Ras, Raf, or MEK1 expression constructs at a 1:4 ratio using methods described previously (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As a control, pNRL356 was cotransfected with plasmid pcDNA3 at similar ratios. A cytomegalovirus promoter-drivenlacZ gene construct was used for normalization of transfection efficiency as described previously (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing human Sp1, Sp3, or Sp4 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. G. Suske, and those expressing human GSKα and GSKβ were from Dr. T. Saitoh's laboratory. Constitutively active and dominant-negative mutants of human Ras, Raf, or MEK1 genes used in this study have been described previously (40Si J. Miller D.S. Mei L. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation and nuclear extraction, PC12 cells were treated by serum starving in 0.1% fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 day and then treated with 100 ng/ml NGF. Cells were lysed in situ with RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemical, Indianapolis, IN) (34Krainc D.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from PC12 cells by a modified Dignam method (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recombinant human Sp1 protein was purified from HeLa cells overexpressing full-length human Sp1 cDNA in a recombinant vaccinia virus (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Five footprinting units (fpu) of Sp1 protein or 45 μg of protein from PC12 nuclear extracts was treated with 50 units of activated murine ERK2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), 5 units of murine protein kinase A (PKA) (New England Biolabs), or 400 units of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. For EMSAs, 0.5 fpu of Sp1 or 2.25 and 4.5 μg of protein from PC12 cell nuclear extracts were incubated with radiolabeled probes: a GC box consensus (Promega) and the 112-bp NR1 probe (39Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Sp1 protein in vitro was tested as follows. One fpu of recombinant Sp1 protein was incubated with 50 units of recombinant ERK2 in the presence or absence of 40 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (>6,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the buffer provided with ERK2 and supplemented with 0.2 mm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the reactions were run together with 0.25 fpu/lane Sp1 protein on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was exposed to X-film for 4 h at −80 °C and then probed by a polyclonal Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in immunoblot analysis with ECL for 5 s (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitation was conducted for ERK1 protein in PC12 cells as follows. Lysates of PC12 cells were cleared with rabbit serum-protein A/G-agarose and incubated with either 2 μg of a polyclonal anti-ERK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 1.6 μg of a polyclonal anti-Sp1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A/G-agarose, washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with loading buffer at 95 °C. Eluted proteins were fractionated on 4–20% SDS-gel and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For ERK1 immunoprecipitation, immunoblot analysis was carried out with the polyclonal Sp1 antibody first and, after stripping the membrane, with the ERK1 antibody; for Sp1 immunoprecipitation, the analysis was done with the above antibodies in a reverse order. In some experiments, the chemiluminescence signals associated with chosen band(s) on the blots were quantified on a Kodak Image Station 440CF and analyzed by the 1D Image Analysis software following the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All experiments were repeated at least six times, and the DNA data analysis was done using Vector NTI suite software (InforMax, North Bethesda, MD). Our previous studies revealed that NGF is capable of up-regulating the NR1 promoter in the presence of serum (22Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To clarify whether serum itself has a possible influence on the NR1 promoter, we studied the effects of serum and NGF on the promoter after serum deprivation. The experiments were done in two lines of stable transfectant PC12 cells: PC12/pNRL356/neo expressing the 356-bp promoter-luciferase gene, and PC12/pNRL3029/neo expressing the 3,029-bp promoter-luciferase gene (22Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, removal of serum from culture quickly decreased the activity of the NR1 promoter in both cell lines as early as 15 min, and 2 h later this attenuation reached a stable level, losing ∼50% of the initial activity. Then, we added serum back to PC12/pNRL356/neo cells and observed a robust increase of 13-fold within 2 h, which was higher than that before serum deprivation (Fig. 1 B). In comparison, addition of NGF also increased promoter activity by 15-fold, and treatment with serum plus NGF caused an even higher and additive increase (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were also obtained for PC12/pNRL3029/neo cells (data not shown). These results suggest that both NGF and serum positively regulate the NR1 promoter, and their mechanisms of activation may be different. In addition, the 356-bp promoter sequence can be considered as the minimal sequence responding to serum and NGF. To focus on NGF signaling and avoid possible interference of serum, in the following experiments, we withdrew serum from PC12/pNRL356/neo cells for 2 h and then treated them with NGF for 2 h. Considering that the PI3K and Ras/ERK cascades transduce most neurotrophin signaling in gene expression, we investigated whether these cascades participate in transducing NGF signaling to the NR1 promoter. We treated cells with inhibitors specific to PI3K (wortmannin), MEK1 (PD98059), or p70S6K (rapamycin) (41Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar) before NGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 2 A, pretreatment of PC12/pNRL356/neo cells with wortmannin blocked ∼70% of the NGF effect on the NR1 promoter. These results indicate an involvement of the PI3K cascade in NGF-regulated NR1 promoter activity. Because PI3K may signal through multiple effectors including activation of p70S6K and inhibition of GSK, we tested these two kinases as possible downstream effectors. Interestingly, application of rapamycin to cells showed no significant effect on promoter activity (Fig.2 A). Then we examined whether GSK has an inhibitory effect on the promoter by transiently coexpressing GSKα and/or GSKβ with the 356-bp NR1 promoter/luciferase gene (pNRL356) in PC12 cells. Cotransfection showed no inhibitory effect; rather, there was a slight increase in promoter activity by 60% caused by GSKα (Fig.2 B). Therefore, the PI3K effect on the promoter probably is not transduced by p70S6K or by GSK. Very interestingly, PD98059 pretreatment of PC12 cells suppressed about 70% of the NGF up-regulated activity (Fig. 2 A). This blockade suggests that a Ras/ERK pathway is involved in the NGF effect. To test this possibility further, we examined the effects of components of the Ras/ERK cascade on pNRL356. We performed cotransfection of the pNRL356 construct with cDNAs for the components in this pathway: Ras, Raf, or MEK1. As shown in Fig. 2 C, all of these constitutively active factors robustly increased reporter activity up to 23-fold over that in cells transfected with pNRL356 plus vector pcDNA3. In comparison, cotransfection with the dominant-negative forms of Ras, Raf, or MEK1 had no effect or resulted in only a slight increase (1.9-fold) by dominant-negative Ras (N17Ras) (Fig.2 C). These results clearly indicate that the Ras/ERK cascade is important in the regulation of the NR1 promoter. Interestingly, no inhibition of the nonstimulated activity of this promoter was observed with dominant-negative components. This suggests that the Ras/ERK pathway is not involved in the nonstimulated, basal activity of the NR1 promoter. However, we did not test the effect of dominant-negative forms on NGF activity because transient cotransfection needs to be monitored for the transfection efficiency with a second reporter gene driven by a viral promoter that is often regulated by growth factors such as NGF (22Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5936-5942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our previous studies revealed that a proximal promoter region containing a GSG and overlapping tandem GC boxes is important for the NGF response. In addition, sequence analysis of this region revealed no regulatory element for transcription factors known to be direct substrates of MAPK. Therefore, to examine the possibility that the GSG/GC boxes are important elements of Ras/ERK signaling, we transiently cotransfected the active MEK1 gene with wild type or mutated GC box pNRL356 constructs into PC12 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, disruption of individual GC boxes dramatically reduced promoter activation by MEK1 to about 15% of full response of the wild type promoter, and a double mutation caused a further small reduction to 9% of wild type activity. It is known that the GC box in a double-stranded conformation interacts with three members of the Sp family, i.e. Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 (23Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To test their potential roles in responding to Ras/ERK for NR1 promoter activation, we cotransfected pNRL356 with expression constructs of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. As expected, overexpression of individual Sp proteins caused an increase in reporter activity of 3.0-fold by Sp1, 3.35-fold by Sp3, or 2.46-fold by Sp4 (Fig.3 B). Data shown in Fig. 3strongly suggest that Sp proteins are potential effectors of ERK in mediating NGF signaling to the NR1 promoter. Searching for MAPK phosphorylation sites using a consensus of PXT/SP orXXT/SP (9Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed 9 putative phosphorylation sites in human Sp1, 10 in mouse, and 10 in rat. The potential of each site was scored from 0 to 1 by using NetPhos 2.0 software (www.cbs.dtu.dk) (42Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) and is listed in Table I for those sites scoring greater than 0.5. It should be noted that Sp1 from all three species contains 6 sites with expected scores greater than 0.5. The sites located at the N terminus or C terminus of the protein are stable across species, whereas the internal sites vary with species. We then examined possible interactions between ERK1 and Sp1 protein in PC12 cells and the effect of NGF on this interaction with immunoprecipitation experiments. A polyclonal ERK1 antibody was used to precipitate ERK1 from PC12 cell lysates, and immunocomplexes were analyzed separately on immunoblot by Sp1 and ERK1 antibodies. Results showed that the ERK1 antibody precipitated ERK1 protein (p44), but not ERK2 (p42) (Fig. 4 A), although the same antibody also detected ERK2 (p42) in immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates without immunoprecipitation (lane 5, Fig.4 A). This indicates that the antibody had a high specificity in recognizing native ERK1 protein in immunoprecipitation but cross-reacted with ERK2 that had been denatured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel fractionation. Very interestingly, a band migrating at 105 kDa was detected by an Sp1-specific antibody not only in the whole cell lysates but also in immunoprecipitated eluates (Fig. 4 A). The same band was detected in PC12 nuclear extracts as well as with recombinant Sp1 protein (data not shown). More interestingly, NGF treatment of PC12 cells for 1 h increased the signal of this coprecipitated Sp1-like protein, whereas there is no significant change of precipitated ERK1 compared with other samples (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, NGF treatment for 24 h or Sp3 transfection did not change the signal compared with untreated cells. It is known that NGF-induced ERK activation lasts for more than 1 h, but not for 24 h (35Peraldi P. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We quantitatively scanned luminescent signals for both Sp1 and ERK1 on the blot and calculated relative changes of the Sp1 signalversus the ERK1 signal on the same blot. The results showed that NGF treatment caused a relative increase in the Sp1 signal by 5.6-fold. The coprecipitation of Sp1 with ERKs was confirmed further by applying an Sp1-specific antibody in immunoprecipitation of NGF-treated cells, and both ERK1 and ERK2 appeared on the blot (lane 6, Fig. 4A). To test whether ERK phosphorylates Sp1, we incubated recombinant Sp1 protein with activated recombinant ERK2 enzyme in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Then, we fractionated the reaction on a SDS-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and blotted proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. An autoradiogram revealed a specific band from the reaction contain"

In this study, the crystallographic structure of dimeric E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase at 1.55 Å resolution is reported. The structure corresponds to a β-barrel closed on one side by a β-sheet lid. This barrel results from the assembly of the two subunits.

The solved structure markedly differs from those of all other documented tRNA-dependent hydrolases. noncrystallographic symmetry It was observed early on that purified Escherichia coliand Bacillus subtilis tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases can transferd-tyrosine to tRNA (1Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 2Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Later, extracts of E. coli, yeast, rabbit reticulocytes, or rat liver were reported to contain an enzyme activity, calledd-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase, capable of accelerating the hydrolysis of the ester linkage ofd-Tyr-tRNATyr in the production of free tRNA and d-tyrosine (3Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). l-Tyr-tRNATyrwas left intact by this activity. Recently, two other E. coli aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tryptophanyl- and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases, were also shown in vitro to be capable of transferring the d-form of their cognate amino acid onto the cognate tRNAs (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thed-Trp- and d-Asp-tRNA products behave in vitro as substrates of purified d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase (5Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). E. coli d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase is encoded by thedtd gene (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Orthologs of this gene occur in many bacteria as well as in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, mouse, and human. Involvement of the deacylase in the protection against in vivo produced d-Tyr-, d-Trp-, ord-Asp-tRNA is demonstrated by the exacerbation of the toxicity of each of these three d-amino acids in response to the inactivation of the E. coli dtd gene (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The toxic effects of d-Gln and d-Ser also respond to the absence of the dtd product, therefore suggesting that Gln- and Ser-tRNA synthetases from E. coli can transferd-Gln and d-Ser, respectively, onto tRNAin vivo (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the case of yeast, inactivation of the DTD1 gene also leads to the toxicity of d-Tyr andd-Leu (5Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above data indicate that the specificity ofd-Tyr-tRNA deacylase is large enough to accommodate anyd-aminoacyl-tRNA substrate. Indeed d-Tyr-,d-Trp-, and d-Asp-tRNA have been demonstrated to be substrates. In their earlier paper, Calendar and Berg (3Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) noted that partially purified E. coli d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase also cleaved d-Phe-tRNA and Gly-tRNA. Thein vivo data strongly suggest that d-Gln- andd-Ser-tRNA are recognized by the E. colideacylase (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and that d-Leu-tRNA is a substrate of yeast deacylase (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast with such a broad specificity, the deacylase rejects all substrates containing an l-amino acid moiety.N-Blocked d-aminoacylated tRNAs also fully resist the action of d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, the deacylase appears not to simply behave as ad-amino acid esterase. Calendar and Berg (3Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) showed thatd-Tyr-adenosine was not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. In contrast, a d-Tyr-esterified oligonucleotide produced by RNase T1 digestion of d-Tyr-tRNA was a substrate. In the derived 19-mer oligonucleotide, the deacylase possibly recognizes a feature common to all tRNAs, for instance the CCA triplet at the end of the acceptor stem of the polynucleotide. On the side of the amino acid moiety, the deacylase would only distinguish the stereoisomeric character of the Cα. In the present study, the three-dimensional structure of crystallineE. coli d-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase, a polypeptide of 145 amino acid residues behaving in solution as a dimer (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), is reported. The core of the enzyme is formed by a β-barrel-like structure resulting from the assembly of the two subunits. Sequence alignment of deacylase orthologs and structural analysis allow us to propose the location of a putative active site. E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was overexpressed in strain JM101TR harboring plasmid pYtH (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C into liquid 2× TY medium (16 g/liter bacto tryptone, 10g/liter bacto yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. At mid-log phase, isopropylthio-β-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cultures were grown overnight prior to harvest. Crude extract preparation and removal of nucleic acids by streptomycin precipitation were performed as described previously (4Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant was brought to 45% ammonium sulfate saturation, left 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged (35 min at 12,000 × g). The supernatant was brought to 80% ammonium sulfate saturation. After centrifugation for 1 h at 12,000 × g, the protein sample was dissolved in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed against 2 liters of the same buffer. The resulting sample was purified to homogeneity over two chromatographic columns: (i) Q-Sepharose Hi Load column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100–500 mm NaCl gradient and (ii) a Superdex-75 gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Before crystallization, the deacylase sample was concentrated to 17 mg/ml by using a Vivaspin 4 Concentrator (Vivascience). Initial rate of deacylase activity was measured at 28 °C in 100-μl assays containing 20–30 nmd-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 5 mm MgCl2(6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The assay also contained either EDTA (1 mm) or ZnCl2 (0.1 mm). The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme and quenched by the successive additions of ethanol, 20 μl of carrier RNA from yeast (4 mg/ml), and 0.3 m of sodium acetate. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 ×g, and 300 μl of the supernatant were mixed with 6 ml of Picofluor scintillation mixture (from Packard) and counted in a Beckman LS3801 counter. Zinc atomic absorbancies were followed at a wavelength of 213.9 Å in the peak height mode during 5 s after 0.1-ml injections, using a Varian SpectrAA220 spectrophotometer equipped with an air acetylene burner (18Fourmy D. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Mayaux J.-F. Blanquet S. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4647-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Prior to metal analysis, deacylase was extensively dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and chromatographied through a molecular sieve column TSK4000SWXL (TOSOHAAS, Japan). Standard solutions containing various metal concentrations (1.25–20 μm) were obtained by dilution in the above buffer. Initial screening for crystallization conditions was performed at 6 °C by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops, using Crystal Screen I and II sparse matrix solutions (Hampton Research). The first crystals were obtained within a few days in condition 45 of Crystal Screen I (18% PEG8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m zinc acetate). The crystals were bipyramidal and diffracted to 3.5 Å resolution. To improve the quality of the crystals, new screenings were done by varying the pH value and the PEG8000 concentration. A distinct crystal form appeared with 10% PEG8000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and 0.2 m zinc acetate. This new crystal belonged to space group C2. Cryoprotection conditions for recording at 100 K were defined as 10% PEG8000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.2 m zinc acetate, and 25% ethylene glycol. Cryo-cooled crystals diffracted below 1.8 Å by using a rotating anode source and below 1.55 Å by using synchrotron radiation (LURE DW32 or ESRF ID14-EH1 beamlines). The data were processed using Mosflm (A. G. W. Leslie, Cambridge, UK) and programs of the CCP4 package (20Collaborative Computational Program Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). A single isomorphous heavy atom derivative could be obtained by soaking the native crystals during 48 h at 6 °C in a solution containing 13% PEG8000, 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.2 m zinc acetate, and 0.5 mm mercuric bromide. Diffraction data were collected from this derivative at the DW32 beamline (LURE, Orsay, France) using x-rays at a wavelength of 0.9474 Å. Four mercury sites were identified by analysis of a Patterson map with data between 10 and 3 Å resolution, using the CCP4 program RSPS. At this stage, the reference data set was native 1 (Table I). Heavy atom positions and occupancies were first refined using MLPHARE (21Otwinowski Z. Wolf W. Evans P.R. Leslie A.G.W. Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering. Science and Engineering Research Council, Warrington, UK1991: 80-86Google Scholar). Then refinement of heavy atom parameters, including anisotropic temperature factors, was continued using SHARP (22de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). At the final stage, anomalous signal from the mercury atoms was used to improve the phases distribution in SHARP. After solvent flattening using SOLOMON (23Abrahams J.P. De Graaff R.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a map was calculated with data up to 3 Å resolution. The quality of the map was sufficient to identify some secondary structure elements in two of the four monomers in the asymmetric unit. This allowed the definition of a noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS)1 mask as well as of an NCS operator. The quality of the phases was improved by NCS averaging and solvent flattening with a density modification program (24Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). From the resulting map, the two remaining NCS operators could be defined. After 4-fold NCS averaging, the size of the mask was then gradually increased to cover most of a monomer.Table INative and heavy atom derivative data used in structure determination of d-Tyr-tRNA Tyr deacylaseData setNative 1Native 2HgBrReagent concentration0.5 mmSoaking time2 daysX-ray sourceLabLURE W32LURE W32ProcessingMOSFLMMOSFLMMOSFLMResolution (Å)1.871.552.3Completeness97.1 (87.9)100 (100)97.6 (89.9)Redundancy1.84.11.9R sym (I) (%)1-aRsym(I)=∑hkl‖Fphhkl−Fphkl‖∑hklFphkl where i is the number of reflection hkl.6.7 (16.3)6.7 (32.4)6.4 (15.4)ΔF ISO(%)1-bFiso=∑hkl‖Fph1‖−‖Fp+Fh‖∑hkl‖Fph−Fp‖where Fph are the structure factors of the derivative and Fp those of the native crystal.15.1Number of heavy atom sites4R cullis1-cRcullis=[∑hkl|Fh|2∑hkl(|Fph|2−|Fph(calc)|2)]1/2 for the centric terms only.

The quality of the NCS-averaged map was such that most of the backbone of one molecule could be readily constructed using O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). After one round of refinement using crystallography and NMR software (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) with strict NCS, refinement was continued without NCS restraints. TheR value of the initial model was 46% for data to 2.8 Å resolution. After relaxing the NCS restraints, R and freeR values fell to 40%. When free R reached a value of 30% (for all data to 2.1 Å resolution), the native 1 data set was replaced by the native 2 data set. Refinement was continued with all data to 1.55 Å resolution. The final R factor was 20.9%, and free R was 22.8% (for 6% of the data left out of the calculations). Alternative conformations were refined for a total of 13 residues encompassing the four monomers. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession number1JKE. Monoclinic crystals of E. coli d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase (deacylase) belong to space group C2 with cell parameters of a = 118.3 Å, b= 83.0 Å, c = 82.6 Å, and β = 128.3°. The structure of deacylase was solved by single isomorphous replacement including anomalous scattering information, followed by solvent flattening and 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging. Indeed, the asymmetric unit contains four monomers. The final model in the asymmetric unit contains all the 4 × 145 amino acid residues, as well as 419 water molecules and 12 zinc ions. The crystallographicR factor is 20.9% (free R = 22.8%). The model has very good geometry with root mean square deviations from ideal geometry of 0.0046 Å for bond lengths and 1.3 degrees for bond angles. All residues lie within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. It has been previously established by molecular sieving that theE. coli native enzyme is a dimer (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, two dimers can be easily identified in the asymmetric unit. The corresponding monomers termed mono 2 and mono 3 (dimer 1) and mono 1 and mono 4 (dimer 2), respectively, display extensive contact. Another 2-fold NCS axis relates these two dimers. The final density is of very good quality for the two dimers. However, two loops (residues 55–65 and residues 90–99) show mobility in mono 1 and mono 4 (dimer 2), whereas they are unambiguously defined in mono 2 and mono 3 (dimer 1). For this reason, only the structure of dimer 1 will be further discussed below. The monomeric unit of deacylase (mono 2 or mono 3 of dimer 1) is formed by two β-sheets at ∼45° one from each other (Fig. 1). The first sheet (S1) is composed of β8, β1, β4, β5, and β6, with β1 antiparallel. The second sheet (S2) is made of three antiparallel strands β7, β2, and β3. Notably, β1 and β2 are contiguous, nearly forming a long kinked β-strand (Fig. 1). A similar situation occurs with β3–β4 on the one hand and β7–β8 on the other hand. In this way, S2 extends a part of S1 (Fig. 1). Two helices, α1 and α2 are packed on one side of S1. The topology as well as the three-dimensional arrangement of the subdomain formed by β4-α1-β5-α2-β6 corresponds to the half of a Rossmann fold. Accordingly, we found that this subdomain can be superimposed with the first half of the Rossmann fold of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase fromThermus thermophilus (7Nureki O. Suzuki K. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kohno T. Matsuzawa H. Ohta T. Shimizu T. Morikawa K. Miyazawa T. Yokoyama S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The root mean square value corresponding to the superimposition is 2.26 Å for 46 aligned Cα atoms. In the monomer structure, α1 is connected to β5 by a long loop, L1, containing a β hairpin followed by a short helix. Loop L2 connects β5 to α2 and contains a short helix followed by a coiled turn. These two loops protrude out of the core of the structure. The other secondary structure elements composing the monomer are connected by short turns. The two monomers composing the dimeric enzyme display extensive contact with an interface area of 1080 Å2. The main set of contacts occurs through an antiparallel interaction between the two β7 strands. This contact extends the S2 sheet of each monomer to form a single six-stranded antiparallel β sheet. In the dimer, the six-stranded antiparallel β sheet forms a lid that covers the N-terminal side of a β-barrel-like structure. The barrel results from the arrangement of the two S1 sheets. However, instead of being closed by β-strand interactions, the barrel is held by contacts involving the β8 strand of one monomer and the L2 loop of the other monomer. Moreover, two key contacts involve the side chains of Gln78and Thr80 (L2), which interact with main chain atoms of residues 138 and 140 (β7). A supplementary important contact involves the two Gln6 residues, which interact together inside the core of the barrel (Fig. 2).Figure 2Location of the conserved residues in the three-dimensional model of dimeric E. colideacylase.

Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3561) Google Scholar) revealed no obvious structural similarity. However, some structural similarity of the β-barrel core of the deacylase with the family of the triose-phosphate isomerase barrels could be detected. The backbone structure of the dimeric deacylase (290 residues) could be partly superimposed on that of triose phosphate isomerase from S. cerevisiae (9Lolis E. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6619-6625Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) with a root mean square of 4.8 Å for 100 compared Cα atoms. The resemblance between the two proteins remains limited, however. During the course of refinement, very strong peaks (>10 sigmas) appeared in F o −F c difference Fourier maps. These peaks must correspond to metal ions, likely zinc ions. Indeed, crystals of deacylase were obtained in the presence of 0.2 m zinc acetate, and the identified densities show co-ordinations consistent with those expected for zinc ions. These co-ordinations are with 4, 5, or 6 ligands (Table II). Notably, none of these ligands is conserved in the deacylase sequences (Fig. 3). Eventually, 12 zinc atoms could be identified in the asymmetric unit (Table II).Table IILigands of the 12 zinc ions in the asymmetric unitZn1E18 mono4 2.0D107 mono2s 2.0D100 mono3s 1.9E111 mono2s 2.0Zn2E103 mono4 2.2D107 mono4 2.1E18 mono2 2.1HOH 2.1HOH 2.1Zn3E22 mono2s 2.0E111 mono4 2.0HOH 2.3HOH 2.2HOH 2.1Zn4D100 mono4 2.1D100 mono4s 2.1HOH 2.2HOH 2.2HOH 2.4HOH 2.4Zn5E103 mono3 2.1E18 mono1 2.3D107 mono3 2.0HOH 2.1Zn6E16 mono1 2.1E47 mono2s 2.1HOH 2.1HOH 2.1Zn7D36 mono4 2.0D128 mono2 1.9HOH 2.1HOH 2.2Zn8E22 mono3 2.1E111 mono1 2.3HOH 2.3HOH 2.2HOH 2.2HOH 2.2Zn9E18 mono3 2.2D107 mono1 2.1E103 mono1 2.4HOH 2.1HOH 2.1Zn10E117 mono3 2.3HOH 2.2HOH 2.0HOH 2.2HOH 2.1Zn11HOH 2.4HOH 2.4HOH 2.2HOH 2.2HOH 2.2HOH 2.1Zn12HOH 2.5HOH 2.4HOH 2.3HOH 2.2HOH 2.1HOH 2.0For each zinc ion, the ligand residues are indicated, together with the monomer to which this residue belongs and the distance between the ligand and the zinc ion.

An “s” after the name of a monomer means that a molecule related by crystallographic symmetry is considered. To know whether native deacylase in solution was associated to zinc ions, a sample of homogeneous enzyme was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm KCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed enzyme was then passed through a molecular sieve column TSK4000SWXL equilibrated in the same buffer. One single peak (about 20 μm) with the molecular weight of a dimer and devoid of zinc (<0.02 mol of zinc/mol of dimer) was recovered. Activity of this enzyme sample did not depend on the presence of either 1 mmEDTA or 0.1 mm ZnCl2 in the assay buffer (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Finally, we verified by molecular sieving that the dimeric character of the deacylase was insensitive to the presence of 5 μmzinc in the elution buffer. From this set of experiments, we concluded that the zinc association, as revealed by crystal analysis, had no functional significance. The available sequences of putative d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylases were compiled and aligned (Fig. 3). The two most conserved zones correspond to residues 77–81 (SQFTL) and 134–140 (NXGP(V/F)T). As shown on the three-dimensional structure of dimer 1 in Fig. 2, the 77–81 zone of one monomer is spatially close to the 134–140 zone of the other monomer. Such a cluster is present twice in the symmetrical dimer. Gln78, Phe79, and Thr80 are at the surface of the protein and form an accessible cavity. Also contributing to this cavity is Arg7 of the β1 strand, a residue well conserved. Indeed, Arg7 is found in all deacylase sequences but two, where it is replaced by Lys (Fig. 3). Remarkably, the two symmetrical cavities communicate via a network of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2) involving both stretches of conserved residues as well as the highly conserved Gln6(only one exception among the deacylases sequences, where Gln6 is replaced by Thr; Fig. 3). Actually, the two Gln6, one from each monomer, interact together (Fig. 2, right panel). From these observations, we propose that the two cavities contain the active centers of the protein. Such a positioning would imply a communication between the two active sites. It was previously demonstrated that d-Tyr adenosine was not cleaved by the enzyme, whereas a 19-mer oligonucleotide esterified withd-Tyr could be efficiently hydrolyzed (3Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This observation suggests the occurrence in the enzyme structure of a tRNA recognition site. In the model, four conserved basic residues (Arg48 and Arg53 from one monomer, and Arg87 and Arg90 from the other monomer) are close to the putative active site (Fig. 2). Calculation of a surface potential map (10Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comp. Chem. 1991; 12: 435-445Crossref Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) suggests that these residues could form a cationic channel (Figs. 2 and 3). Such a channel might help the protein to establish contacts with the 3′-end of the tRNA polyanion in ad-amino acid-tRNA substrate. This work describes the first structure of a d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. Functionally, this enzyme resembles peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, which cleaves the ester bond between a peptide and a tRNA, thereby allowing the recycling of peptidyl-tRNAs produced by premature termination of translation (11Kössel H. RajBhandary U.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 539-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,12Cuzin F. Kretchmer N. Greenberg R.E. Hurwitz R. Chapeville F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 2079-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is markedly distinct from the deacylase. Indeed, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is composed of a mixed stranded β-sheet surrounded by helices and is functionally active under the form of a monomer (13Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). d-Tyr-tRNATyrdeacylase activity also resembles the tRNA-dependent hydrolytic activity of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases capable of proofreading the product of their aminoacylation reaction. For instance, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase has the capacity to hydrolyze misaminoacylated Val-tRNAIle (14Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were shown to possess a deacylase activity, although this appears to be a side reaction (16Sourgoutchov A. Blanquet S. Fayat G. Waller J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, including isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (17Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), are known. Comparison of these structures with that of the deacylase reveals no obvious similarity. We conclude, therefore, that the structure of d-Tyr-tRNA deacylase illustrates a new type of aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolase. The availability of this three-dimensional structure and the proposed localization of the active site should be helpful to design experiments aimed at probing the bases of specificity in this new family of tRNA-dependent hydrolases.

https://openalex.org/W2161261440,"One type of membrane microdomain, enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol and referred to as lipid rafts, has been implicated in the generation of activating signals triggered by a variety of stimuli. Several laboratories, including ours, have recently demonstrated that the B cell receptor (BCR) inducibly localizes to the rafts upon activation and that functional lipid rafts are important for BCR-mediated “positive” signaling. In the later phases of the immune response, coligation of the BCR and the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB1 leads to potent inhibition of BCR-induced positive signaling through the recruitment of the inositol phosphatase SHIP to FcγRIIB1. One potential model is that the FcγRIIB1 itself might be excluded from the rafts basally and that destabilization of raft-dependent BCR signaling might be part of the mechanism for the FcγRIIB1-mediated negative regulation. We tested this hypothesis and observed that preventing BCR raft localization is not the mechanism for this inhibition. Surprisingly, a fraction of FcγRIIB1 is constitutively localized in the rafts and increases further after BCR + FcR coligation. SHIP is actively recruited to lipid rafts under negative stimulation conditions, and the majority of FcγRIIB1-SHIP complexes localize to lipid rafts compared with non-raft regions of the plasma membrane. This suggested that this negative feedback loop is also initiated in the lipid rafts. Despite its basal localization to the rafts, FcγRIIB1 did not become phosphorylated after BCR alone cross-linking and did not colocalize with the BCR that moves to rafts upon BCR engagement alone (positive signaling conditions), perhaps suggesting the existence of different subsets of rafts. Taken together, these data suggest that lipid rafts play a role in both the positive signaling via the BCR as well as the inhibitory signaling through FcγRIIB1/SHIP.

Mice deficient in FcγRIIB1 have hyper-responsive B cells and elevated levels of circulating antibodies (23Takai T. Ono M. Hikida M. Ohmori H. Ravetch J.V.

Although our understanding of the biochemical events that govern the positive and negative regulation of antigen receptor signaling has significantly improved in the past decade, the spatio-temporal aspects of these processes are just beginning to be elucidated. Recently, one type of specialized microdomains within the plasma membrane, known as “lipid rafts,” has been shown to play a key role in signal transduction by multiple cell surface receptors (27Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 28Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin.

These more ordered glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich structures, referred to as detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes or glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (GEMs), exist as laterally mobile rafts within the liquid crystalline plasma membrane bilayer (27Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 31Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol.

Whereas glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins and Src family kinases are tightly anchored into these microdomains, several signaling proteins can associate with GEMs in a regulated manner and initiate signaling events (29Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Drevot P. He H.T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Although the precise fraction of the plasma membrane that contains such “ordered” domains could vary depending on the cell type and state of cellular activation, lipid rafts could serve as platforms for initiation of immunoreceptor signaling and/or cytoskeletal reorganization as well as partitioning of signaling events (32Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8113) Google Scholar). A more dynamic picture of lipid rafts has also been proposed where rafts could change their size and composition in response to various stimuli (30Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (5160) Google Scholar). These modifications may affect the affinity of receptors and signaling molecules for rafts and thereby influence the outcome of receptor ligation (30Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (5160) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that activation of B cell receptor results in rapid recruitment of BCR itself as well as PLCγ2 into lipid rafts, whereas the Src family kinase Lyn constitutively resides in this microdomain (33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We also showed that phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and induction of calcium flux by BCR requires intact lipid rafts, as disruption of rafts by the antifungal agent filipin dramatically inhibited BCR-induced calcium mobilization, suggesting a critical role for rafts in initiation of BCR signaling (33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Positive B cell co-receptors such as CD19/CD21 have been shown to increase the duration of residency of the BCR in the lipid rafts and augment BCR-mediated signaling (36Cherukuri A. Cheng P.C. Sohn H.W. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Guo et al. (37Guo B. Kato R.M. Garcia-Lloret M. Wahl M.I. Rawlings D.J. Immunity. 2000; 13: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) reported a similar role for rafts in pre-BCR signaling and showed the translocation of Syk, BLNK, PI3K, Btk, Vav, and PLCγ2 into this compartment after receptor ligation. The significance of rafts in the regulation of B cell function has also been demonstrated by its role in antigen uptake, internalization, and processing in the context of antigen presenting function of B cells (38Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 39Cheng P.C. Brown B.K. Song W. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3693-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, Weintraub and Goodnow (40Weintraub B.C. Goodnow C.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R575-R577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in contrast to naive B cells, tolerant B lymphocytes are incapable of recruiting their surface Ig into GEMs, suggesting raft aggregation as a critical step in determining the fate of developing B cells. Taken together, these reports strongly suggest a critical role for lipid rafts in BCR signaling at different stages of development and maturation. Although a role for lipid rafts in the generation of activation signals downstream of the B cell antigen receptor is now well established, it is not known whether the inhibitory feedback regulation of BCR signaling by FcγRIIB1 and SHIP also occurs in lipid rafts. One potential model is that the FcγRIIB1 itself might be excluded from the rafts basally and that destabilization of raft-dependent BCR signaling might be part of the mechanism for the FcγRIIB1-mediated negative regulation. Here, we tested this hypothesis and observed that preventing BCR raft localization is not the mechanism for this inhibition. A fraction of FcγRIIB1 is constitutively localized in the rafts and increased further after BCR + FcR coligation. SHIP is actively recruited to lipid rafts under negative stimulation conditions, and the majority of FcγRIIB1-SHIP complexes localize to lipid rafts compared with non-raft regions of the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data suggest an important role for the lipid rafts also in the initiation of inhibitory signaling. Murine A20 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 20 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Rabbit anti-mouse IgGs (F(ab′)2 fragment and intact antibody) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine RC20 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal anti-SHIP (C terminus) antibody, rabbit anti-Lyn antibody, rabbit anti- PLCγ2 antibody, and rhodamine- and FITC-labeled goat anti-rat antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-FcγRIIB1 antibody was generously provided by Dr. John Cambier (National Jewish Center, Denver, CO). Anti-BLNK rabbit polyclonal antibody was a gift from Dr. Andy Chan (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). FITC-labeled cholera toxin B (FITC-CTB) was purchased from Sigma and rhodamine-labeled CTB from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment from goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Vectashield mounting medium was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Poly-l-lysine was purchased from Sigma. Stimulations and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (16Aman M.J. Lamkin T.D. Okada H. Kurosaki T. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33922-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, A20 cells were stimulated with 15 μg/ml F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG (to cross-link the BCR) or 30 μg/ml intact anti-mouse IgG (to co-cross-link the BCR to FcγRIIB1 for the indicated times at 37 °C). Because the molecular weight of F(ab′)2 antibody is roughly half that of an intact antibody, the latter was used at twice the concentration to match their molar ratio. For Western blot and immunoprecipitation, cell lysates or membrane and raft fractions (see below) were incubated with the relevant antibody plus protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and bound proteins were analyzed by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and developed by ECL (16Aman M.J. Lamkin T.D. Okada H. Kurosaki T. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33922-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). 8–10 × 107 A20 cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm MgCl2, protease, and phosphatase inhibitors), and membranes were broken by Dounce homogenization (30 strokes) and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, NaCl concentration was adjusted to 150 mm final, and lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g to remove the nuclei. Post-nuclear lysate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was designated as the cytoplasmic fraction, whereas the pellet contained the membranes and cytoskeleton. To prepare rafts from the membrane, the pellet was washed extensively and lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and rafts were prepared as described previously (33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were diluted 1:1 with 80% sucrose, overlaid by 2 ml of 30% sucrose followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in a Beckman ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 16–20 h at 200,000 × g. After the centrifugation, the lipid raft band, visible at the interface of 30 and 5% sucrose (insoluble fraction), was removed and solubilized by adding octyl glucoside (Sigma) at 10 mm. The 2 ml of lysate at the bottom of the tube represented thenon-raft membrane (NRM) fraction. The pellet represented the cytoskeletal fraction. In some experiments, cells were directly lysed in Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer and subjected to raft preparation. A20 cells were stained with rhodamine- or FITC-labeled cholera toxin B to label ganglioside M1, as a raft marker, for 20 min at 4 °C. Staining of BCR was performed with Cy3-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment of goat anti-mouse for 20 min at 4 °C. For staining of FcγRIIB1, cells were incubated with rat monoclonal anti-FcγRIIB1 antibody (2.4G2) for 20 min on ice, washed, and visualized with FITC- or rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rat antibody. For BCR stimulation, after the incubation on ice with Cy3-anti-IgG [F(ab′)2], cells were warmed up to 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and where applicable, after staining with secondary anti-rat antibody, the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were subsequently resuspended in Vectashield mounting medium, placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides, covered with coverslips, and sealed. Cells were then analyzed using an Olympus confocal microscope. One potential mechanism by which FcγRIIB1 could mediate its inhibitory effects is through destabilizing lipid raft-dependent signaling via the BCR. Such a model would predict that the FcγRIIB1 would be excluded from the lipid rafts and that coligation of BCR and FcγRIIB1 might affect the BCR-dependent recruitment of downstream signaling molecules to the lipid rafts. Because BCR cross-linking has been shown to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific set of proteins in the lipid rafts (33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 38Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), we first examined whether the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in the lipid rafts might be affected by BCR + FcR coligation in murine A20 B cells. When we compared the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the rafts after BCR cross-linking alone versus BCR + FcR co-cross-linking, there was no obvious loss of phosphoproteins as might be expected if the FcR were to disrupt the localization of BCR in the rafts (Fig.1 A). In fact, there was an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of at least two bands that corresponded to the molecular weights of FcγRIIB1 (∼55 kDa) and SHIP (145 kDa) in the lipid rafts faction after BCR + FcR co-cross-linking (see below). We also analyzed the inducible localization of the BCR after cross-linking, with or without concurrent FcγRIIB1 coligation. The induced raft localization of the BCR was unaffected by co-cross-linking with FcγRIIB1 (Fig. 1 B and see later below in Fig. 5 B). The quality of the raft preparations in these experiments was confirmed by the presence of Lyn only in the raft fraction (Fig. 1 B).Figure 5Analysis of BCR and FcγRIIB1 localization in the rafts by confocal microscopy. A, for the control unstimulated condition, the A20 cells were incubated with Cy3-F(ab′)2antiI-gG on ice for 20 min. For BCR alone cross-linking, the cells were incubated with Cy3-F(ab′)2 anti-IgG at 37 °C for 5 min and then for 15 min on ice. For cross-linking of BCR with the FcR, the cells were incubated with Cy3-intact anti-IgG at 37 °C for 5 min and then for 15 min on ice. The cells were then washed and stained for GM1 with Alexa 488-CTB for 20 min on ice followed by confocal microscopy. The colocalization red and green staining is revealed as yellow in the overlay. B, left panel, A20 cells were stained with rhodamine-CTB and anti-FcγRIIB1 2.4G2 rat mAb at 4 °C, washed, and stained with FITC-labeled anti-rat antibody and analyzed by confocal microscopy.Arrows point to some of the areas of colocalization between GM1 and FcγRIIB1, which appear yellow. Two different cells are shown. Middle panel, cells were stained with Cy3-anti-IgG [F(ab′)2] and FITC-CTB, warmed to 37 °C for 5 min to activate BCR, washed, and analyzed. Arrowsindicate few areas of colocalization between BCR and GM1. Right panel, cells were stained with Cy3-anti-IgG [F(ab′)2] and 2.4G2, warmed to 37 °C for 5 min to activate BCR, washed, and stained with FITC-labeled anti-rat antibody and analyzed. Note that there was no obvious colocalization ofgreen and red staining to produceyellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then analyzed the raft fraction for the presence of FcγRIIB1 basally, as well as after BCR alone cross-linking and BCR + FCR coligation. Total raft fractions were isolated from unstimulated and stimulated A20 cells, and the presence of FcγRIIB1 was assessed by immunoblotting with an anti-FcγRIIB1 antibody. Surprisingly, this revealed a constitutive presence of a fraction of FcγRIIB1 in the lipid rafts (lane 1, Fig. 1 C, upper panel), which increased after BCR + FcR coligation (lane 3). Even though we detected a slight increase in FcγRIIB1 in the rafts after BCR cross-linking alone in this experiment (lane 2), this was not consistently seen in other experiments. Moreover, when we assessed the tyrosine phosphorylation of FcγRIIB1, a critical event in recruitment of SHIP and inhibitory signaling, the phosphotyrosine signal was detectable in the lipid rafts only after BCR + FcR coligation (Fig. 1 C, middle panel). When we compared the presence of FcγRIIB1 in raftsversus non-rafts membrane (NRM) fractions, we observed that the majority of FcγRIIB1 was localized to NRM both under basal conditions and after BCR + FcγRIIB1 cross-linking (Fig.1 D). Inhibition of PLCγ2 activation has been implicated as a key mechanism for FcγRIIB1-dependent inhibition of calcium flux initiated through the BCR. We had shown previously (33Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 393-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that PLCγ2 moves to lipid rafts after BCR cross-linking and that disruption of the lipid rafts affects PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as calcium flux. Immunoblotting of the same membrane with anti-PLCγ2 antibody showed no significant change in the level of raft-associated PLCγ2 (Fig. 1 C, bottom panel). BLNK/SLP-65 molecule is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that has been implicated in BCR-induced calcium flux through recruitment of PLCγ2 and the tyrosine kinase Btk (41Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T.

We also observed that phosphorylation of BLNK and its interaction with PLCγ2 were unaffected by BCR + FcR coligation (Fig.1 E), suggesting that the inhibitory signaling by FcγRIIB1 does not involve an inhibition of the physical translocation of PLCγ2 into lipid rafts, its phosphorylation, or its association with BLNK. Taken together, these data suggest that the FcγRIIB1-mediated inhibition of BCR signaling does not affect the raft localization of the BCR or the signaling proteins that localize to these microdomains, and that a fraction of FcγRIIB1 itself is localized to the lipid rafts, with an increase in the levels after BCR + FcγRIIB1 coligation. FcγRIIB1-dependent inhibition of BCR-mediated signaling requires the complex formation between SHIP and the phosphorylated FcγRIIB1 (12Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V.

Are the neurons that carry the sensory evidence also involved in generating an interpretation? To address this question, we studied the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys involved in a task in which they have to trace a curve mentally, without moving their eyes. On a percentage of trials, the monkeys made errors and traced the wrong curve. Here, we show that these errors are predicted by activity in area V1.

An Mcm3/5 dimer is the form most loosely associated with other Mcm proteins in the heterohexamer. Only the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex among these complexes has an ability to induce DNA replication in the Xenopus egg system (12Thommes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The Mcm2–7 all have a DNA-dependent ATPase motif in the central domain (14Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2541-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Partly consistent with this notion, it was found that DNA helicase activity is associated with an Mcm4,6,7 hexameric complex (a dimer of Mcm4,6,7 trimer) prepared fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe (13Lee J.-K.

These results indicate that the assembly of Mcm4,6,7 proteins into a hexamer is crucial for the DNA helicase activity and also suggest that Mcm2, -3, and -5 proteins play a role in regulating the Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity.

Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further analyzed the interplay between Mcm2 and the Mcm4,6,7 helicase and also determined the region in Mcm2 that is required for in vitrophosphorylation with a human Cdc7/ASK1 kinase. In addition, we found that Mcm2 can assemble nucleosome-like structuresin vitro, and the activity is related with the histone binding ability of Mcm2. Human Mcm4,6,7 hexameric complex was purified from HeLa cells by histone-Sepharose column chromatography and then by glycerol gradient centrifugation as reported (16Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). For preparing deletion mutants of mouse Mcm2 protein, theMcm2 gene was truncated by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers; as a forward primer, 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCGATCCCCTCACCTCCAGCCCAGGC-3′ (nucleotides from the mouse Mcm2 gene are underlined) for starting at amino acid (aa) 22, 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCGACCTCCCCCCATTTGAAGATGAG-3′ for starting at aa 45, 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCATGGAGGAAGAAGAGGATGG-3′ for starting at aa 63, 5′-TCGAATTCATGCTGGATGATGAAGATGTGGAGGAG-3′ for starting at aa 97, 5′- GACGAATTCGAGGATGAAGAGATGATCGAGAGTA-3′ for starting at aa 163, and 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCATGAACAAAGTAGCTGTGGGGGAGCTC -3′ for starting at aa 449. As a reverse primer, 5′-TCGAATTCTTAATGGATGTGGTTGGTGATACGG-3′ for ending at aa 282, and 5′-GAGTGAGCGGCCGCTCAGTCCTTCTTGGCAACA TGGTTGGC-3′ for ending at aa 448 were used. These Mcm2 genes were cloned in a pAcHLT-A vector (Pharmingen) for production of histidine-tagged Mcm2 proteins in a baculovirus expression system. When mouse Mcm2,4,6,7 complexes were prepared, High5 cells were co-infected with three vi- ruses for producing the histidine-tagged Mcm2, histidine-tagged Mcm4 and Mcm6 (pAcUW31vector) (15You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and Mcm7 proteins (pVL1392 vec- tor). The Mcm2 proteins and Mcm2,4,6,7 complexes were purified by Ni2+ column chromatography, and the Mcm2,4,6,7 complexes were fur- ther purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation as reported. A human glutathioneS-transferase-huCdc7/myc-ASK complex was purified from High5 cells co-infected with the recombinant baculoviruses (37Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the complex was purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography as the manufacturer suggested (Pharmingen). Briefly, cell lysate was mixed with a 1/10 volume of glutathione agarose and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Then the agarose was washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the human glutathione S-transferase-Cdc7/myc-ASK complex was eluted with 5 mm glutathione in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The Mcm2,4,6,7 complexes (40–400 ng) were incubated with various amounts of the huCdc7/ASK complex at 30 °C for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture consisting of 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 40 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm EGTA, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 0.01% Triton X-100 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed in 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. The same sample was digested with lysyl endopeptidase in the presence of 0.1% SDS and analyzed in 15–25% polyacrylamide gel. Each of the mouse Mcm2 and Mcm6 genes was cloned in pBluescript II SK plasmid (Stratagene). Truncated forms of theMcm2 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers from each site. An ATG sequence was added to the 5′-end of the forward primers to create a methionine at the amino terminus of the Mcm2 proteins. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mcm2 gene was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide 5′- GTCAAGTACAACGCTAGCAAGGCCAACTTTGTACTGGGGC-3′ was used as a primer to introduce changes from Cys to Ala at positions 329 and 332 in a putative zinc finger motif. The resulting DNAs were cloned into pBluescript II SK. The mutated sites in Mcm2 were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Various Mcm2 proteins and native Mcm6 protein were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine in a reticulocyte lysate system, as suggested by the manufacturer (TNT- coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega). Histidine-tagged mouse Mcm4 proteins were prepared by Ni2+ column chromatography after production in insect cells, and they were fixed with CNBr-activated Sepharose at the concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Bovine serum albumin fixed with the Sepharose was prepared as control beads. Aliquots of the [35S]methionine-labeled Mcm proteins were mixed with the mouse Mcm4-beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Mcm2 gene was conducted. The oligonucleotide 5′-CTCCAGCCCAGGCCTTAGCTCCATACTTGCTGACGCCCTG-3′ was used as a primer to introduce changes from Arg to Leu at position 30, from Arg to Ile at position 33, and from Arg to Leu at position 34 in NTS1 (18–34), whereas 5′-GAAGATGAGGAGCTGCCTGCCCTTGCGCGCCGCCACGTAG-3′ was used for changes from Arg to Leu at position 146, from Arg to Leu at position 149, and Lys to Ala at position 150 in NTS2 (132). The native form as well as the mutagenized forms of the mouseMcm2 gene were cloned into pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) to synthesize Mcm2-GFP fusion proteins where the carboxyl-terminal end of the Mcm2 protein was fused to the amino-terminal end of GFP. The cloned DNAs were transfected into mouse L cells using a CalPhos Maximizer transfection kit (CLONTECH). The cells (5 × 104) were grown in 8-well chambers with 250 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 1 day. The cloned DNA (1.5 μg) was mixed with CalPhos Maximizer, calcium solution, and Hepes-buffered saline and left for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA solution was added to the cells in culture medium. The dish was placed at 37 °C in a CO2incubator for 5 h. The DNA solution was removed, growth medium was added, and the dish was returned to the incubator. After 2 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the fluorescence in the cells was observed by Olympus AX80 and photographs were taken. A 17-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) was labeled at the 5′-end with polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to M13 DNA. The annealed oligomer (2.5–5 fmol) was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with an Mcm4,6,7 complex in the presence or absence of Mcm2 protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm ATP, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.2% SDS, and an aliquot was electrophoresed on a 12% acrylamide gel in Tris borate/EDTA. The labeled oligomer in the gel was detected by using a Bio-Image Analyzer (FLA2000, Fuji). To analyze the effect of Mcm2 on the complex formation of Mcm4,6,7 proteins, increasing amounts of Mcm2 proteins were incubated with an Mcm4,6,7 complex for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100, and the mixture was analyzed under non-denaturing conditions by native 5% acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane after incubation in 49 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 38 mm glycine, and 0.25% SDS at 80 °C for 1 h, and Mcm4 on the membrane was detected by using anti-Mcm4 antibodies. Plasmid DNA (pSV01EP, 100 ng) was incubated with topoisomerase I in 10 mmcreatine-phosphate (sodium salt), pH 7.8, 4 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm potassium phosphate for 15 min at 37 °C. Indicated amounts of Mcm2 protein were mixed with H3/H4 histones (300 ng) in the same buffer as described above for 15 min. These two solutions were combined, and the reaction was further run for 45 min. After purification, DNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. We reported that Mcm2 can inhibit the DNA helicase activity of an Mcm4,6,7 hexamer by disassembling the hexamer into an Mcm2,4,6,7 tetramer (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mcm4,6,7 proteins mainly formed a hexameric complex or else a trimeric complex, as was determined by native acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using anti-Mcm4 antibodies (Fig.1 A). In the presence of full-size mouse Mcm2, these mouse Mcm4,6,7 complexes were converted to a tetrameric Mcm2,4,6,7 complex. We examined the region in Mcm2 that is required for the disassembly of the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer into the Mcm2,4,6,7 complex. The Mcm4,6,7 complex was incubated with mutant Mcm2 proteins, and then the changes in molecular mass of Mcm complexes were examined. Similarly to full-size Mcm2, a mutant Mcm2 that is deleted at the amino-terminal region (1) retained the activity to disassemble the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer and to form the Mcm2,4,6,7 tetramer (Fig.1 A). In the presence of larger amounts of the mutant Mcm2 protein, the mobility of the Mcm2,4,6,7 complex was retarded in native gel, suggesting that more than one molecule of Mcm2 protein is bound to the Mcm4,6,7 trimer under these conditions. The formation of the Mcm2,4,6,7 complex was observed in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues in place of ATP in the reaction mixture (data not shown). In contrast, the amino-terminal half (1) of the Mcm2 protein did not show any disassembly activity (Fig. 1 B). Next, the effect of mutant Mcm2 proteins on the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer was examined (Fig. 2). Mcm2 deleted at the amino-terminal end (1) showed inhibition of DNA helicase activity similar to the full-sized Mcm2 protein (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, an amino-terminal fragment (1) of Mcm2 did not show inhibitory activity. These results indicate that the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 is dispensable not only for disassembly of the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer but also for the inhibition of the DNA helicase activity of the Mcm4,6,7 hexamer.Figure 2Inhibition of Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity by Mcm2. A, Mcm4,6,7 complex (100 ng) was examined for DNA helicase activity in the presence of two different amounts (25 and 50 ng) of Mcm2 mutants (Δ1–162, 1–282). The position of the released 17-mer is indicated. At the bottom (B), a summary of the results is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From pull-down experiments, we found that Mcm2 protein mainly interacts with Mcm4 among Mcm4, -6, and -7 proteins. 2Y. Ishimi, unpublished results. To determine the region in Mcm2 that is required for the interaction with Mcm4, we prepared three deletion mutants of Mcm2 protein. The mutant Mcm2 deleted at the amino-terminal region (1) and the amino-half (1) were detected as several bands in SDS-gel, which may be alternatives of the in vitro translation products. These proteins and also Mcm6 protein, as a control, were mixed and incubated with mouse Mcm4-beads, and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3). The results showed that both a mutant Mcm2 deleted at the amino-terminal region (1) and a carboxyl-half (449) of Mcm2 were capable of binding to the Mcm4-beads but not to bovine serum albumin beads (Fig.3). Approximately 7% of radioactivity was recovered in the Mcm4-bound fraction for the Mcm2 proteins of full size and Δ1–166 and 11–12% for Mcm2 (449) and for Mcm6 protein. In contrast, the amino-half (1) did not bind to Mcm4. Less than 2% of radioactivity was recovered in the bound fraction for the amino-half of Mcm2 protein. These results indicate that the carboxyl-half of Mcm2 plays an important role in interacting with Mcm4 protein, although the possibility that the binding is not due to a direct interaction of bound proteins with Mcm4 cannot be excluded. Consistent with the above notion, mutations at a putative Zn2+ finger motif in the amino-half of Mcm2 did not affect the binding of Mcm2 to the Mcm4 beads. These results and those in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that Mcm2 protein disassembles Mcm4,6,7 hexamer through the interaction of its carboxyl-half with Mcm4 in the hexamer. A number of reports indicate that Mcm2 protein is a good substrate of Cdc7 kinase in vitro (25–37). We incubated a purified Mcm2,4,6,7 complex with the human Cdc7/ASK kinase complex (Fig.4, A and B). Consistent with the previous studies, Mcm2 of full-size was specifically phosphorylated with the kinase in the Mcm2,4,6,7 complex under these conditions. To map the region in Mcm2 that is required for the phosphorylation with the Cdc7/ASK kinase, we constructed four Mcm2 proteins deleted at the amino-terminal region and then purified Mcm2,4,6,7 complexes containing these Mcm2 (Fig. 4 A). The Mcm2 deleted at amino acids 1–44 showed an unexpected mobility in SDS-gel. We incubated these complexes with Cdc7/ASK kinase (Fig. 4,B and C). In contrast to full-size Mcm2, all the three mutant Mcm2 proteins in which the amino-terminal region was deleted to different extents (Δ1–62, Δ1–162, and Δ1–448) were hardly phosphorylated by the kinase (Fig. 4 B). To further map the region required for the phosphorylation, we prepared two additional deletion mutants of Mcm2 (Δ1–21 and Δ1–44) and phosphorylated the Mcm2,4,6,7 complexes containing them with the Cdc7 kinase (Fig. 4 C). A slight decrease in the phosphorylation was detected in the Mcm2 deleted at 1–21, and a relatively distinct decrease was detected in the Mcm2 deleted at 1–44. The results indicate that the amino-terminal region (1–62) of mouse Mcm2 plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation by Cdc7/ASK kinase (Fig.4 D). Phosphorylated full-size Mcm2 appears as single band in Fig. 4 B, whereas it appears as two bands in Fig.4 C and Fig. 5 A. Comparison of number of incorporated phosphates in these experiments suggests that a higher level of phosphorylation leads to generation of an extra band of phosphorylated Mcm2 on SDS-gel.Figure 5Quantification of Mcm2 phosphorylation. A, Mcm2,4,6,7 complex containing full-sized Mcm2 was phosphorylated with three different amounts of Cdc7/ASK, and proteins were electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS.B, phosphorylated proteins in A were digested with lysyl endopeptidase and analyzed on 15–25% acrylamide gel.C, the number of phosphate molecules incorporated into full-size Mcm2 (horizontal line) and into the amino-terminal fragment (1) (vertical line) in the above experiments were calculated and plotted with closed circles. Several other experiments are included in the graph where the data in the same experiment were plotted with the same symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To address the issue of whether the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 contains major Cdc7-mediated phosphorylation sites, the phosphorylated full-sized Mcm2 in Mcm2,4,6,7 complex was digested with lysyl endopeptidase to analyze the phosphorylation in the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 (Fig. 5). The digestion generated a fragment of amino acids, 1–150 of Mcm2 (see Fig. 8 B), that was detected as a 45-kDa band in SDS-gel (Fig. 5 B). Incorporation of32P into full-sized Mcm2 and into the amino-terminal fragment in the same sample was quantified in several experiments where the phosphorylation was carried out at the different levels of Cdc7 kinase; the results are shown in Fig. 5 C. When one molecule of phosphate was incorporated into full-size Mcm2, one molecule of phosphate was recovered in the amino-terminal fragment of Mcm2, indicating that Cdc7 kinase phosphorylates only the amino-terminal region. When 3 mol of phosphate were incorporated into full-size Mcm2, however, two molecules were recovered in the amino-terminal region, suggesting that one mol of phosphate is incorporated into the region other than the amino terminus. These results and those in Fig. 4 suggest that the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 plays a role in the phosphorylation in the region other than the amino-terminal region in addition to the role as the phosphorylation sites. We determined the histone binding activity in the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The Mcm2 in Mcm complexes specifically bound to histone H3 among four core histones. To elucidate the physiological role of the histone binding activity, we measured the nucleosome assembly activity of mouse Mcm2 protein (Fig. 6). The histone H3/H4, instead of four core histones, was used for the nucleosome assembly assay (38Bina-Stein M. Simpson R.T. Cell. 1977; 11: 609-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). If nucleosome-like structures were formed on circular DNA, negative supercoils of DNA would be generated in this system. Thus, the recovery of negatively supercoiled form-I DNA suggests that the plasmid DNA is fully assembled into nucleosome-like structures. Full-sized Mcm2 was able to stimulate the nucleosome assembly in vitro, similar to Nap-1, which showed nucleosome assembly activity in vitro (39Ishimi Y. Kojima M. Yamada M. Hanaoka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 162: 19-24Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although the level of the activity in Mcm2 was lower than that in Nap-1 (Fig. 6 A). We also determined the region in Mcm2 that is required for the activity by preparing several deletion mutants (Fig. 6, A and B). The results indicated that the deletion of 162 amino acids from the amino terminus abolished the nucleosome assembly activity (Fig. 6 A). However, the deletion of 62 amino acids from the terminus did not perturb the activity, and the removal of 96 amino acids reduced the activity (Fig.6 B). Thus, the region spanning amino acids 63–162 at the amino-terminal end of Mcm2 is required for the activity, although the amino-terminal region (1) of Mcm2 was not sufficient for the activity (Fig. 6 A). The region 63–162 almost overlapped with the histone H3 binding domain of Mcm2 identified previously. Thus, it is suggested that Mcm2 stimulates nucleosome assembly in vitro by interacting with histone H3/H4 through the histone H3 binding domain. We showed that the amino-terminal region (1) is required for the nuclear localization of mouse Mcm2 when it was expressed in HeLa cells as a GFP fusion protein (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There are two bipartite-type nuclear-targeting sequences (40Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar) in this region of mouse Mcm2, one at position 18–34 (NTS1) and the other at 132–152 (NTS2). We introduced mutations into these two sequences and examined the effect on the nuclear localization of Mcm2-GFP fusion proteins expressed in mouse L cells (Fig.7). The mutations in NTS1 did not alter the nuclear localization of the fusion protein, but the mutations in NTS2 significantly perturbed the nuclear accumulation of the fusion protein. The Mcm2-GFP fusion protein mutated at the NTS2 was detected not only in nuclei but also in cytoplasm. When both of the NTS1 and 2 were mutated, the fusion protein was also detected both in nuclei and cytoplasm. These results suggest that the NTS2 plays an important role in the nuclear localization of Mcm2 under these conditions. This conclusion is consistent with the previous observations that the amino-terminal deletion up to amino acids 92 did not affect the nuclear localization of Mcm2 (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this paper, we analyzed the biochemical activity related to the mouse Mcm2 protein, which includes that to inhibit Mcm4,6,7 helicase and to assemble nucleosomes in vitro. We determined the region in Mcm2 required for the phosphorylation by Cdc7/ASK kinase and the region required for nuclear localization of Mcm2. We localized these activities in Mcm2, as shown in Fig.8. The results indicated that the carboxyl-half of Mcm2 is required for interacting with Mcm4 as well as for inhibiting the DNA helicase activity of Mcm4,6,7 complex. We showed that the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 where a histone H3 binding domain and a region required for nuclear localization are present is required for the phosphorylation by Cdc7 kinase. In this region, a number of Ser and Thr residues are present in addition to three consensus sites for cyclin-dependent kinase. Mcm2–7 are all essential for eukaryotic DNA replication, but only the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex among several Mcm complexes has the ability to induce DNA replication in the Xenopus egg system (12Thommes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All the members have a DNA-dependent ATPase motif, but the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex shows neither significant ATPase activity or DNA helicase activity (41Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, an Mcm4,6,7 complex as a hexamer showed an ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity in vitro (13Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a structural change in the Mcm2–7 heterohexamer or a change in protein composition occurs in the Mcm complex (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 42Tye B.K. Sawyer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34833-34836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Genetically Mcm proteins interacts with Cdc7/Dbf4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Young M.R. Kihara M. Sugino A. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3365-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 43Hardy C.F. Dryga O. Seematter S. Pahl P.M. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Mcm2 is a good substrate of the kinase in vitro (25–37). Thus, it is probable that Cdc7 kinase is involved in these changes in the Mcm complex. One possibility is that phosphorylation of Mcm2 by the kinase is involved in a structural change of the Mcm2–7 heterohexamer by which the DNA helicase activity that may intrinsically reside in the complex is induced (42Tye B.K. Sawyer S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34833-34836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The notion that the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex acts as a DNA helicase in vivo is supported by the following findings. First, Mcm proteins appear to migrate on chromosome after the initiation of DNA replication in S. cerevisiae(44Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Second, it has been demonstrated that all the Mcm proteins are required for elongation of DNA replication after initiation has occurred (45Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been indicated that Mcm proteins mainly form the Mcm2–7 heterohexamer in vivo. Another possibility is that an Mcm4,6,7 complex is generated from the Mcm2–7 complex, and the phosphorylation of Mcm2 by Cdc7 kinase is involved in the removal of Mcm2,3,5 proteins (17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by the following findings. First, only the Mcm4,6,7 hexameric complex showed DNA helicase activity among several Mcm complexes including the heterohexameric Mcm2–7 complex that were all prepared in a baculovirus expression system.2 Second, the genetic evidence that the requirement of Cdc7 kinase was bypassed by mutation of Mcm5 in S. cerevisiae suggests that Mcm5 at least functions as a negative regulator of DNA replication (43Hardy C.F. Dryga O. Seematter S. Pahl P.M. Sclafani R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3151-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, both Mcm2 and Mcm3/5 complex can inhibit Mcm4,6,7 helicase activity in vitro (13Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18871-18878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Ishimi Y. Komamura Y. You Z. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8369-8375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Sato M. Gotow T. You Z. Komamura-Kohno Y. Uchiyama Y. Yabuta N. Nojima H. Ishimi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Third, the Mcm4,6,7 proteins form relatively stable complexes of a monomer and a dimer of the 4,6,7 trimer, and Mcm2,3,5 proteins are relatively loosely associated with the Mcm4,6,7 trimer in the Mcm2–7 heterohexamer. This structural information appears to be consistent with the change in the composition of the Mcm complex. It is possible that the ATP binding motif of Mcm2,3,5 proteins is involved in releasing Mcm4,6,7 complex from the heterohexamer at the time when the Mcm complex functions as a DNA helicase. A similar example can be seen at the initiation of DNA replication in E. coli where a DnaC protein, which is an ATPase but an inhibitor of DnaB helicase, forms a complex with DnaB and binds to the origin region. In this system, it appears that the ATPase activity of DnaC is required for releasing DnaB at the initiation of DNA replication (46Wahle E. Lasken R.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2469-2475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second model, that the Mcm4,6,7 complex generated from the Mcm2–7 complex functions as a DNA helicase in vivo, may not be inconsistent with the finding that all the Mcm2–7 proteins are required for elongation of DNA replication as well as initiation (45Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the possibility that the Mcm4,6,7 helicase functions in DNA replication is supported by the recent finding that the Mcm4,6,7 complex from S. pombe acts as a processive DNA helicase when a tailed substrate is used for the reaction (47Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, we have no direct evidence for this second model. The present finding indicating that Cdc7/ASK kinase mainly phosphorylates the amino-terminal region of Mcm2, which is not required for interacting with the Mcm4,6,7 complex, seems to be inconsistent with the model. However, our results suggest that the region other than the amino-terminal region is also phosphorylated with Cdc7/ASK (Fig.5). We have another piece of data indicating that other regions of the Mcm2 which include the carboxyl-terminal segment of the protein in the Mcm2,4,6,7 complex are also phosphorylated by the kinase in vitro (data not shown). These phosphorylations at regions other than the amino terminus may modulate the structure of the Mcm complex or influence the interaction of Mcm2 with other components of the Mcm complex. Further efforts are clearly necessary to clarify the mechanism of Mcm function. It also remains to be determined to what extent Mcm helicase is responsible for replication fork movement in vivo (48Labib K. Diffley J.F.X. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cdc7/ASK kinase phosphorylated an amino-terminal region of Mcm2 where a histone H3 binding domain and a region required for nuclear localization are present. We do not know the effect of the phosphorylation of Mcm2 by Cdc7/ASK kinase on these two activities. It has been reported that Mcm2 proteins, which are detached from chromatin during the S phase, are more phosphorylated than chromatin-bound Mcm2 proteins (49Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phosphorylation of Mcm2 is involved in the detachment of Mcm proteins from chromatin. It has been shown that Cdc2/cyclinB is involved in the phosphorylation of Mcm2 proteinsin vivo using a temperature-sensitive mutant of the kinase (50Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We observed that the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 is phosphorylated by Cdk2/cyclinA or Cdk2/cyclinE in vitro(data not shown). Thus, both cyclin-dependent kinase and Cdc7 kinase may be involved in the phosphorylation of the amino-terminal region of Mcm2 proteins (34Jares P. Blow J.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1528-1540PubMed Google Scholar, 37Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In fact, prior phosphorylation of the Mcm2,4,6,7 complex with Cdk stimulated subsequent phosphorylation of Mcm2 by Cdc7 (37Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It has been also shown that cyclin-dependent kinase plays a role in the initiation of DNA replication by loading Cdc45 protein at the replication origin (51Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 52Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We showed that the region around amino acid 150 (NTS2) is required for nuclear localization of mouse Mcm2. The nuclear localization of Mcm2 may depend on nuclear import of the protein and also on nuclear retention of the protein (53Young M.R. Suzuki K. Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 7 suggest that mutation in the NTS2 did not affect the nuclear import but affected the retention of Mcm2 in the nucleus. In S. pombe, both of two regions of amino acids 5–10 and 114–118 are required for nuclear localization of Mcm2 (54Pasion G. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 4043-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The region near the amino terminus functions as a nuclear localization signal. Finally, we detected in Mcm2 activity that stimulates nucleosome assembly in vitro. The histone binding domain in Mcm2 was required for the activity. Thus, Mcm2 protein may bind with histone H3/H4 and transfer them to DNA to assemble nucleosome-like structures in vitro. The physiological significance of the activity remains to be clarified. It is possible, however, that the activity is involved in chromatin assembly during DNA replication by interacting with parental or newly synthesized histones. Conversely, it may be involved in DNA replication by disassembling nucleosomes to facilitate unwinding of DNA. Recently, it has been reported that Mcm proteins are involved in transcriptionin vivo (55Yankulov K. Todorov I. Romanowski P. Licatalosi D. Cilli K. McCracken S. Laskey R. Bentley D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6154-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 56DaFonseca C. Shu F. Zhang J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3034-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a histone acetyltransferase interacts with the histone H3 binding domain of Mcm2 (57Burke T.W. Cook J.G. Asano M. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15397-15408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Mcm proteins may play a role in several chromatin activities in addition to having an essential role in DNA replication. We thank Etsuko Matsui for excellent technical assistance in preparing Cdc7/ASK kinase complex."

Recent evidence suggests pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β or transforming growth factor α, protects carcinomas from numerous pro-apoptotic stimuli. Platelet-activating factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-3-glycerophosphocholine; PAF) is a lipid mediator with pro-inflammatory effects on numerous cell types. Although PAF can be metabolized to other bioactive lipids, the majority of PAF effects occur through activation of a G protein-coupled receptor. Using a model system created by retroviral transduction of the PAF receptor (PAF-R) into the PAF-R-negative human epidermal cell line KB and the PAF-R-expressing keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, we now demonstrate that activation of the epidermal PAF-R results in protection from apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The PAF-mediated protection was inhibited by PAF-R antagonists, and protection did not occur in PAF-R-negative KB cells. Additionally, we show protection from TNFα- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis by PAF-R activation is dependent on the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB, because PAF-R activation-induced NF-κB and epidermal cells transduced with a super-repressor form of inhibitor κB were not protected by the PAF-R.

Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can occur during embryogenesis, induction, and maintenance of immune tolerance, development of the nervous system, and endocrine-dependent tissue atrophy (2Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). In the skin, apoptosis is involved in epidermal development and growth and deletion of UV-damaged keratinocytes (3Woodcock A. Magnus I.A. Br. J. Dermatol. 1976; 95: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to normal physiological conditions, essentially all chemotherapeutic agents exert their effects by induction of apoptosis (4Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of apoptosis can have important consequences both during development and in the treatment of cancer. Recent evidence suggests an association between cancer and inflammation, with inflammatory mediators affecting the growth and survival of tumors (5Marks F. Muller-Decker K. Furstenberger G. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 11-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Bours V. Bonizzi G. Bentires-Alj M. Bureau F. Piette J. Lekeux P. Merville M.

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β1 or transforming growth factor α, have been shown to protect human keratinocytes and epidermal-derived carcinomas against numerous pro-apoptotic stimuli (8Kothny-Wilkes G.

Thus the anti-apoptotic effects exerted by pro-inflammatory mediators may provide a mechanism for decreased effectiveness of chemotherapy. Furthermore, the protective effect of these cytokines depends upon the de novo synthesis of protective proteins (10Reinartz J. Bechtel M.J. Kramer M.D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Qin J.Z. Chaturvedi V. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37957-37964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) implicating the activation of epidermal transcription factors. One potential transcription factor that may mediate anti-apoptotic effects in epithelial cells is NF-κB. NF-κB proteins are sequence-specific transcription factors induced in response to inflammatory and other stressful stimuli (12Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13Kaufman C.K. Fuchs E. J.

Indeed, exposure to IL-1β or interferon-γ has been shown to activate NF-κB in primary cultures of human keratinocytes and in transformed keratinocytes (8Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Poppelmann B.

These studies determined that activation of NF-κB mediated the observed anti-apoptotic activity exerted by IL-1β against TRAIL-induced apoptosis (8Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Coincident to the protection from apoptosis, recent evidence indicates that activation of epidermal NF-κB enhances the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP), such as c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, which interfere with apoptosis (15Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar,16Seitz C.S. Freiberg R.A. Hinata K. Khavari P.A. J. Clin.

Accumulating evidence suggests platelet-activating factor (PAF)-mediated pathways are involved in cutaneous inflammation and keratinocyte stress responses (20Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). PAF (1-alkyl-2-acetyl glycerophosphocholine) is a glycerophosphocholine-derived lipid mediator implicated in numerous inflammatory processes. Keratinocytes synthesize PAF and related 1-acyl-PAF-like species in response to various stimuli including ionophores, growth factors, PAF agonists, the pro-oxidative stressor, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, ultraviolet light irradiation, or acute thermal damage (21Travers J.B.

Res. 2000; 292: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although PAF can be metabolized to other biologically active lipids, the majority of PAF effects appear to be mediated by interaction with a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the PAF receptor (PAF-R). In addition to producing PAF, keratinocytes also express the PAF-R (21Travers J.B. Huff J.C. Rola-Plaeszczynski M. Gelfand E.W. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 816-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and activation of the epidermal PAF-R leads to the production and release of PAF, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and eicosanoids (23Dy L.C. Pei Y. Travers J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26917-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Although the ability of cytokines to protect keratinocytes from apoptosis has been established, and potential mechanisms for this protection have been suggested, it is unclear whether PAF has anti-apoptotic effects. However, several lines of evidence suggest that epidermal PAF may inhibit apoptosis. First, PAF can be produced under the same conditions that induce apoptosis and thus may have a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, gentamycin, or 5-fluorouracil have been shown to induce PAF production (26Dos Santos O.F. Boim M.A. Barros E.J. Schor N. Kidney Int. 1991; 40: 742-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Denizot Y. Dupuis F. Comte L. Dulery C. Praloran V. Cancer Lett. 1995; 88: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Second, activation of the PAF-R expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells has been shown to stimulate NF-κB and induce gene expression (28Kravchenko V.V. Pan Z. Han J. Herbert J.M. Ulevitch R.J. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14928-14934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the keratinocyte PAF-R may induce NF-κB expression and protect keratinocytes in a manner similar to cytokines. Of significance, activation of the PAF-R has been shown to rescue B lymphocytes from apoptotic stimuli through an unknown mechanism (29Toledano B.J. Bastein Y. Noya F. Mazer B. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because PAF is produced during inflammation and oxidative stress and activates signal transduction pathways similar to the anti-apoptotic effects of growth factors and cytokines, we sought to determine whether apoptosis in epidermal cells can be modulated by PAF. In this paper, we report that activation of the epidermal PAF-R protects from apoptosis induced by either TNFα or TRAIL. This protective effect was inhibited by pretreatment with PAF-R antagonists. Stimulation of epidermal cells with a PAF receptor agonist resulted in a rapid degradation of IκB and subsequent increase in NF-κB binding. Furthermore, the protective effect induced by PAF-R activation was abolished in epidermal cells expressing a super-repressor form of IκB, indicating that the PAF-R-induced protective effect was mediated by activation of an NF-κB-dependent pathway. Thus, these results demonstrate that, in addition to the anti-apoptotic actions induced by growth factors and cytokines, activation of GPCRs such as PAF-R may also protect epithelial cells from pro-apoptotic agents.

Recombinant human IL-1β and TNFα were from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ), the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor 2-Val-Ala-Asp-FMK (2-VAD-FMK) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The PAF-R antagonist WEB-2086 was kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Ridgefield, CT) and A-85783 was a gift from Dr. James Summers (Abbot Pharmaceuticals, Abbott Park, IL). The human epidermoid cell line KB and human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY). A KB PAF-R model system was created by transduction of PAF-R-negative KB cells with the MSCV2.1 retrovirus encoding the human leukocyte PAF-R as described previously (25Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C.

KB cells transduced with the PAF-R (KBP) or with control MSCV2.1 retrovirus (KBM) were characterized by Southern and Northern blot analysis and by radioligand binding and calcium mobilization studies to demonstrate that the PAF-R was functional (25Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar, 30Travers J.B. J. Invest.

The IκBM containing S32A and S36A mutation of IκBα has previously been described (31Newton T.R. Patel N.M. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Stauss C.R. Goulet Jr., R.J. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18827-18835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the retroviral DNA vector MIEG3, which uses enhanced green fluorescent protein as the selectable marker, was a kind gift of Dr. David Williams (Indiana University) (32Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J.E. Petryniak B. Derrow C.W. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D.R. Lowe J.B. Atkinson S.J. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). To create KBP cells stably expressing IκBM, the IκBM cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of MIEG3, and orientation was assessed by restriction endonuclease mapping and sequencing. Infectious amphotropic retroviruses were produced from both MIEG-IκBM and control MIEG backbone by transient transfection using standard protocols (33Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the Phoenix amphotropic packaging cell line was transfected with the DNA constructs using Fugene-6, and the supernatants collected 48 h later containing infectious virions were then used to infect KBP cells. Transduced cells were fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted on the basis of enhanced green fluorescent protein expression Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate for 20 min on ice. IκB degradation was determined by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to stabilize for 1 day. Cells were then treated for 24 h with fresh medium containing the indicated agents. Cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The effects of treatment are expressed as a percentage of viable cells using the untreated cells as the maximum cell viability. Low molecular weight DNA was extracted from KB cells after TNFα or TRAIL treatment at the indicated times using the Stratagene DNA extraction kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 40 μg of total genomic DNA was separated on a 2.0% agarose gel, and the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. Apoptosis was determined quantitatively using a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kit measures the enrichment of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells as a result of DNA degradation. The absorption was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The enrichment factor was calculated using the following formula: absorbance of apoptotic cells/absorbance of control cells. The activation of the caspase proteolytic cascade was measured by the direct assay of caspase-3 enzyme activity in cell lysates using a synthetic fluorogenic substrate (caspase-3 substrate, Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC (Ac-DEVD-AMC); Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) as described previously (34Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed for 1 h at 37 °C. Release of the fluorogenic AMC moiety was measured using a Hitachi F2000 spectrophotometer (excitation, 380 nm; detection, 460 nm). The fluorescent intensity was converted to pmol of AMC released by comparison to standards of AMC (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The specific activity of caspase-3 in cell lysates was determined following quantitation of the total protein in the cell lysates (NanoOrange protein quantitation reagent; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously (31Newton T.R. Patel N.M. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Stauss C.R. Goulet Jr., R.J. Nakshatri H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18827-18835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA binding reactions were performed for 30 min at room temperature using 6 μg of whole cell extract and32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes for NF-κB consensus binding sites (Promega, Madison, WI). Complexes were separated by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 6% acrylamide gel and assayed by autoradiography. Cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish and allowed to stabilize for 1 day. Cells were then transfected using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 10 μg of NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κB-luc) and 10 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with CPAF and IL-1β or were mock-treated and then harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) following an additional 6-h incubation. 20-μl aliquots of the lysates were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities using an LB9501 luminometer (Lumat). Luciferase activities were normalized for each transfection using the control β-galactosidase activities. Because PAF may have both receptor-dependent and -independent effects (secondary to the formation of biologically active metabolites), our laboratory has previously created a model system by transduction of the PAF-R into a PAF-R-deficient epidermal cell line to study the role of the PAF-R in keratinocyte cell biology. The human epidermal cell line KB, originally obtained from a patient with an oral squamous cell carcinoma (36Eagle H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1955; 89: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), does not express functional PAF-Rs, unlike normal human keratinocytes and the human keratinocyte-derived cell line HaCaT (21Travers J.B.

A PAF-R-positive KB cell line, KBP, was created by transducing KB cells with a replication-deficient MSCV2.1 retrovirus containing the human PAF-R cDNA. KB cells were also transduced with the retrovirus backbone alone to establish a vector control cell line, KBM. Expression of the PAF-R protein was verified by binding studies using radiolabeled PAF-R antagonist WEB-2086 (25Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). Calcium mobilization studies demonstrated that the KB PAF-R was functionally active (25Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar, 30Travers J.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, this in vitroepidermoid system consists of both PAF-R-negative (KBM) and -positive (KBP) cells. In initial experiments, the dose-response and time-response of TNFα- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis were determined using activation of caspase-3, a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and DNA fragmentation as three distinct markers of apoptosis in epidermal cells. Exposing KBP cells to 100 ng/ml TNFα or 40 ng/ml TRAIL for various times was found to induce caspase-3-specific activity (Fig. 1 A), enrich the release of mono- and oligonucleosomes into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B), and enhance DNA fragmentation as shown by DNA laddering (Fig.1 C). Inasmuch as these markers of apoptosis determined that TNFα and TRAIL treatment resulted in a maximal apoptotic effect after 24 h, subsequent experiments therefore examined apoptosis at the 24-h time point. In addition to KBP cells, treatment with TNFα- or TRAIL-induced apoptosis in KBM and HaCaT cells was similar to that observed in KBP cells (data not shown). To determine whether PAF-R activation affects TNF family-mediated apoptosis in epidermal cells, KB cells were pre-treated with the metabolically stable PAF agonist, CPAF. Pre-treatment of KBP cells for 1 h with 100 nm CPAF resulted in a decrease in the TRAIL- and TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig.2 A, black bars), shown as a decrease in caspase-3-specific activity and decreased enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B); however, CPAF had no effect on apoptosis in the PAF-R-deficient KBM cells (Fig. 2 A, gray bars). In contrast to the actions of CPAF, pre-treating cells for 1 h with 25 ng/ml IL-1β protected both KBP and KBM cells from TRAIL- and TNFα-induced apoptosis. These results confirm the studies of Schwartz and co-workers (8Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29247-29253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 9Kothny-Wilkes G. Kulms D. Luger T.A. Kubin M. Schwarz T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28916-28921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that IL-1β protects KB cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore these results suggest that the anti-apoptotic effects of PAF are mediated by activation of the PAF-R, because CPAF inhibited apoptosis in KBP, but not KBM, cells. To further confirm whether the protective effects of CPAF were mediated through a PAF-R-dependent mechanism, we determined whether the selective PAF-R antagonists A-85783 (ABT) or WEB2086 (WEB) could block the protective effects of PAF. As shown in Fig.3 A, exposure to WEB or ABT abolished the anti-apoptotic effects of PAF. Neither ABT nor WEB had any direct effect alone on TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In addition, pre-treatment with WEB or ABT did not affect the anti-apoptotic effects of IL-1β in KBP cells (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results indicate that activation of the PAF-R mediates the protective effects of PAF on epidermal cells. To address whether the protective effects induced by CPAF were secondary to the overexpression of PAF-R in KBP cells, we also examined the protective role of physiological levels of the PAF-R in the immortalized keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. Our laboratory has demonstrated previously that HaCaT cells express functional PAF-Rs (21Travers J.B. Huff J.C. Rola-Plaeszczynski M. Gelfand E.W. Morelli J.G. Murphy R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 816-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,25Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.A. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, treatment with 100 nm CPAF or 25 ng/ml IL-1β for 1 h prior to exposure to TRAIL or TNFα protected HaCaT cells from TNFα- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a manner similar to the protective effect observed with KBP cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that activation of the PAF-R, a GPCR, protects keratinocyte and epidermal carcinoma cells from apoptosis. To determine whether the PAF-R-mediated protection from apoptosis would affect the survival of epidermal cells, we examined the viability of cells treated with either TRAIL or TNFα in the presence or absence of CPAF, IL-1β, or the nonspecific caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. TRAIL and TNFα treatment decreased the number of viable KBP cells by 41.6 ± 1.8 and 49.5 ± 8.3%, respectively (Fig.5). Pre-treatment of KBP cells for 1 h with 100 nm CPAF or 25 ng/ml IL-1β protected cells, shown as a 25–30% increase in cell viability. Treatment with 10 μm of the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk also blocked the decrease in cell viability induced by TRAIL and TNFα. Thus, the cytoprotective actions induced by the PAF-R exerted a survival effect on TRAIL- and TNFα-treated epidermal cells, presumably by inhibiting apoptosis. Because pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors can induce anti-apoptotic effects through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, we next examined whether the PAF-R protective effects were similarly mediated through an NF-κB-dependent pathway. Exposure to CPAF or IL-1β induced a time-dependent degradation of IκBα in KBP cells resulting in the disappearance of immunoreactive IκB within 15–20 min (Fig.6 A). Secondary to the degradation of IκBα, NF-κB binding activity was increased and reached maximal activity ∼1 h after treatment (Fig. 6 B). However, CPAF did not induce IκB degradation nor increase NF-κB binding activity in control KBM cells unlike IL-1β, which induced NF-κB in both KBP and KBM cells (data not shown). To establish that the PAF-R is functionally coupled to a pathway leading to activation of NF-κB, KBP cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter containing NF-κB consensus binding sites and were then stimulated with CPAF or IL-1β. Exposure to CPAF or IL-1β resulted in a 6.2 ± 1.0 (n = 6)- or 5.1 ± 0.5 (n = 6)-fold increase in NF-κB-dependent gene transcription over unstimulated cells, respectively (Fig.6 C). Thus, activation of the PAF-R is functionally coupled to a biochemical pathway that results in NF-κB activation and gene transcription. To determine whether the PAF-R protective effects were dependent on the NF-κB pathway, KBP cells were transduced by retroviral infection to express a super-repressor IκB protein (KBP-MIEG-IκBM). Whereas both CPAF and IL-1β induced IκB degradation and increased NF-κB binding activity in KBP cells transfected with the vector backbone (KBP-MIEG), the stimulated IκB degradation (Fig.7 A) and NF-κB binding activity (Fig. 7 B) were abolished in KBP-MIEG-IκBM cells. Furthermore, the CPAF- and IL-1β-induced protection from TNFα- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis were decreased in KBP-MIEG-IκBM cells (Fig.7, C and D), indicating that the anti-apoptotic activity induced by PAF-R is mediated by an NF-κB-dependent pathway.

Further equilibrium studies showed that poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) enhanced the cap binding of eIFiso4F about 40-fold. The kinetic effects of PABP on cap binding and the temperature dependence of this reaction were measured and compared. Fluorescence stopped-flow studies of the PABP·eIFiso4F protein complex with cap show a concentration-independent conformational change. PABP did not significantly increase the rate of the conformational change, and because the initial second-order binding is essentially diffusion-controlled, the enhancement of cap affinity must reside in the dissociation rate. The dissociation rate was more than 5-fold slower in the presence of PABP. The temperature dependence of the cap binding reaction was markedly reduced in the presence of PABP. The reduced energy barrier for formation of a cap·eIFiso4F complex suggests a more stable platform for further initiation complex formation and a possible means of adapting to varying temperature conditions.

These interactions are mediated by interaction of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)1 and the cap binding complex eIF4F or an isoform of eIF4F found in plants, eIFiso4F. The small subunit of eIF4F (eIF4E) recognizes the cap structure, and the large subunit (eIF4G) interacts with PABP (6Wei C.-C. Balasta M.L. Ren J. Goss D.J.

The cap-associated proteins have a very high affinity for PABP in the absence of poly(A) in the wheat germ system (8Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7168-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Interaction of PABP·eIF4F has been shown to enhance the binding affinity of both cap analogs and poly(A) by about 40-fold. Further studies have shown that both the cap and poly(A) tail can be bound by the protein complex simultaneously. It was concluded that at least part of the enhancement of translation could be accounted for by increased binding affinity for the 5′ cap by the protein complex. The increase in binding affinity of the PABP·eIF4F complex for both cap analogs and poly(A) leads us to further investigate the kinetics and mechanism of these interactions. An increase in affinity for the cap structure can result from an increase in the association rate constant or a decrease in the dissociation rate constant or changes in both. Increases in the association rate constant may indicate an increase in the rate-limiting step, whereas decreases in the dissociation rate constant may indicate an increased stability for the intermediate complex in the protein synthesis pathway. We have previously investigated the mechanism of eIFiso4F or eIFiso4E interacting with cap (1Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies indicated that the binding involved a two-step process with the first reaction being too fast to measure by stopped-flow techniques. The second reaction, a conformational change, was ∼10-fold faster for eIF4E than for eIF4F. Here, we report the effects of PABP on the binding kinetics of cap analog binding to eIFiso4F and the temperature dependence of these reactions. These data indicate that a large part of the enhancement in binding affinity resides in the dissociation rate and that one of the significant effects of PABP is to lower the Arrehenius activation energy of the eIF4F complex. m7GTP was purchased from Sigma. Ant-m7GTP was synthesized and purified as described previously (10Ren J. Goss D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3629-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with slight modification. After completion of the synthesis reaction, there are several products in the solution, Ant-m7GTP, m7GTP, isotoic anhydride, and anthraniloyl acid. Ethanol precipitation was used to separate Ant-m7GTP and m7GTP from the fluorescent dye. For the separation of Ant-m7GTP and m7GTP, a Sephadex G-15 column (1 × 120-cm, packed in deionized water) with a flow rate of 6 ml/hr was used. Ant-m7GTP was eluted as the second peak, which was characterized by UV absorbance and thin layer chromatography. Ant-m7GTP showed two absorbance maxima at 254 and 332 nm, a shoulder at ∼ 280 nm, and a fluorescence spot on TLC plates. Ant-m7GTP was separated from Ant-m7GDP by TLC prior to use. The preparation of PABP followed the procedure of Le et al.(8Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.-C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol.

Fritz W. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 330-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pure P28 and P86 subunits were prepared as described previously (12Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All samples were dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.6) and passed through a 0.22 μmfilter (Millipore) before the spectroscopy measurements were performed. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Absorbance measurements were obtained using a Cary-3 double-beam UV/visible spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Spex Fluorog τ2 spectrofluorometer. All measurements were performed at 20 °C. As described elsewhere (10Ren J. Goss D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3629-3634Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Darzynkiewicz E. Stepinski J.

The time course of the reaction was monitored using an Olis RSM 1000 stopped-flow system with a 1-ms dead time. Ant-m7GTP was mixed with eIFiso4E (P28), eIFiso4F, or eIFiso4F·PABP. Formation of the eIFiso4F·PABP complex was determined as described previously (6Wei C.-C. Balasta M.L. Ren J. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was at 332 nm, and emission was monitored by use of a photomultiplier after passage through a 400-nm cut-on filter. A reference photomultiplier was used to monitor fluctuations in the lamp intensity. The temperature of flow-cell and solution reservoirs was maintained using a temperature-controlled circulating water bath. After rapid mixing of the protein with the Ant-m7GTP cap analog, the data for the time course of the fluorescence intensity changes were recorded by computer data acquisition. Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using Global analysis software provided by Olis. To measure the dissociation rate constants, a complex of eIF4F·PABP·Ant-m7GTP was rapidly diluted 12-fold in a spectrofluorimeter cuvette, and the resulting decrease in fluorescence was measured. Because of the high binding affinity of the cap analog to the complex, a large dilution, which could not be accomplished by stopped-flow, was necessary. The stopped-flow data for a typical reaction curve for the binding of Ant-m7GTP to eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F are shown in Fig.1. On the ordinate is the relative voltage, which is proportional to fluorescence intensity. Time course data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis assuming a single exponential change described by ΔFt = ΔF∞(1 − exp(−kobst)) (16Olsen K. Christensen U. Sierks M.R. Svensson B.

The reaction was consistent with a single exponential process. Analyses that assume two or three time-resolved exponential components did not improve the fitting results. Under the pseudo first-order conditions, where Ant-m7GTP was in excess, the observed rate constant is predicted to be a linear function of the concentration of Ant-m7GTP. However, as observed previously (1Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the results showed that the observed binding rates had little dependence on Ant-m7GTP concentration over a concentration range of 5–19 μm Ant-m7GTP, a 4- to 18-fold excess. The observed rate varied from 31–36 s−1. As proposed previously (1Sha M. Wang Y. Xiang T. van Heerden A. Browning K. Goss D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4266-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the binding mechanism can be explained by a two-step process involving a fast association of eIFiso4E and Ant-m7GTP followed by a slow change of conformation from the first association complex to the stable complex. eIFiso4E+Ant­m7GTP→k1(eIFiso4E·Ant­m7GTP)*↓k2eIFiso4E·Ant­m7GTPEq. 1 The binding rates have the following relationship with the concentration of substrate: 1/kobs = 1/k2 +k1/k2[C] as described previously (16Olsen K. Christensen U. Sierks M.R. Svensson B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9686-9693Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where kobs is the observed first-order rate constant, k2 is the forward rate constant for the second step, and [C] is the concentration of Ant-m7GTP. Fig. 2 is the plot of 1/kobs versus 1/[C] of eIFiso4E, which shows a linear relationship. From the intercept of 1/k2, k2 was found to be 36.9 ± 1.6 s−1. Rate constants for eIFiso4E binding to Ant-m7GTP at 4, 10, 15, 22, and 31 °C are shown in TableI. The values ofk2 for Ant-m7GTP binding to eIFiso4E at different temperatures were calculated from data sets collected at each temperature as in the example shown in Fig. 1. The derived rate constants were used to construct an Arrehenius plot (Fig.3) according to the equation lnk = −(Ea/RT) + ln A, where k is the rate constant, Ea is the activation energy, and A is the Arrehenius pre-exponential term. The activation energy was calculated from the slope of the fitted linear line of ln k versus1/T (kelvin). The activation energy for Ant-m7GTP binding to eIFiso4E, determined from the temperature dependence of the rate constants, was 63.3 ± 1.4 kJ/mol.Table IKinetic binding constants and activation energy for the interaction of eIFiso4E, eIFiso4F and eIFiso4F/PABP with Ant-m 7 GTPTemperaturek2eIFiso4EeIFiso4FeIFiso4F/PABP°Cs −1 4.06.064.4214.010.010.59.3620.015.015.917.128.522.030.637.939.031.069.810262.2Ea (kJ/mol)63.3 ± 1.481.5 ± 2.538.6 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab Rate constants for eIFiso4F are shown in Table I. Fig. 3 also shows the Arrehenius plot for eIFiso4F. The activation energy for Ant-m7GTP and eIFiso4F binding was 81.5 ± 2.5 kJ/mol, which is significantly higher than the value obtained for eIFiso4E. PABP has been shown to affect the equilibrium binding affinity of eIFiso4F for cap analogs. To understand further the mechanism of this reaction, the effects of PABP on the kinetics of reaction were investigated. After adding PABP to eIFiso4F under conditions where a complex is formed, the activation energy decreased to 38.6 (±1.6) kJ/mol (Fig. 3). The activation energy for PABP·eIFiso4F binding to Ant-m7GTP is 2-fold lower than for the eIFiso4F and Ant-m7GTP interaction. Previous work has shown that PABP alone does not bind Ant-m7GTP6. The dissociation reaction was monitored as described above. Fig.4 shows the results of the dilution experiment. The apparent rates are more than 5-fold slower in the presence of PABP. The general mechanism of interaction of the cap with eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F is very similar. Both proteins follow a two-step binding mechanism with the first step being very fast and close to being diffusion-controlled. The rate constants for the second step were similar at about 20 °C; however, the temperature dependence was different. The similarity or rate constants for eIFiso4F and eIFiso4E is surprising. In our previous studies with a dinucleotide cap analog, we found k2 to be almost 10-fold faster for eIF4E, suggesting that the smaller protein was more able to accomplish the conformational change necessary for binding, although the equilibrium constants were similar for the two proteins. The fact that the rate constant, k2, for the two proteins are similar for the mononucleotide analog indicate that the second base must play a role in the binding. In the case of eIFiso4F, this slows down the binding, not only in comparison with eIFiso4E but also compared with the mononucleotide. The Ant-m7GTP bound eIFiso4F about 3-fold faster than m7GpppG. Our previous studies using fluorescence energy transfer have shown that PABP has a large effect on the cap equilibrium with eIFiso4F. The dissociation equilibrium constant decreased from 8.9 to 0.21 μm in the presence of PABP. PABP has been shown to interact with eIFiso4F through the P86 (eIFiso4G) subunit of eIFiso4F. Only a small effect on k2 was observed for the PABP·eIFiso4F binding of cap analog. It is unlikely there is much effect on the initial second-order binding, because that rate is close to the diffusion-controlled rate and cannot account for the large difference in equilibrium constant. The most likely explanation is that the off rate, k−2, is slower when PABP is present. To estimate the off rate, the dilution experiment described earlier was performed. This is not an ideal experiment, because concentrations of Ant-m7GTP must be such that a significant change in the amount of cap analog that is bound occurs. There must also be sufficient eIFiso4F to assure that a significant eIFiso4F·PABP complex exists. Further, because these experiments are performed in a standard 1-cm fluorescence cuvette to allow mixing, large amounts of sample are required. Fig. 4 shows the difference measured. The curve in the presence of PABP represents dissociation from both eIFiso4F and eIFiso4F·PABP. We were unable to adequately resolve two rate constants from these curves, probably because about 10–15% of the reaction occurred during the mixing time. However, a significant difference is seen in the presence of PABP indicating the dissociation rate is indeed affected. The rates are at least 5-fold slower in the presence of PABP. This difference is an underestimate of the effect of PABP on the dissociation rate. More detailed kinetic studies are in progress. The Arrehenius activation energies for the three protein systems, eIFiso4E, eIFiso4F, and eIFiso4F-PABP, were significantly different. The eIFiso4E and eIFiso4F had Arrehenius activation energies of 63.3 ± 1.4 and 81.5 ± 2.5 kJ/mol, respectively. The addition of PABP to eIFiso4F lowered the activation energy more than 2-fold. This reduced temperature dependence suggests that PABP succeeds in speeding the reaction by providing a path with a substantially lower energy barrier. The kinetic effects of PABP enhancement on cap affinity must reside primarily in the dissociation rates. A likely possibility is that PABP, which interacts with the 4G subunit, induces a conformational change that is propagated to the cap binding site. The lower activation energy suggests an intermediate that more easily achieves a stable conformation. PABP reduces the dissociation of the complex and may enhance translation by forming a more stable platform for further assembly of the initiation complex. The reduced temperature dependence of the reaction may provide a means for adapting to variations in environmental temperatures encountered by plant systems. It would not be advantageous for rapid protein synthesis to occur during environmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W2026654976,"We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the intracellular portion of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (Met). We isolated a human cDNA encoding a novel protein of 68 kDa, which we termed FAP68. This protein is homologous to a previously described FK506-binding protein-associated protein, FAP48, which derives from an alternative spliced form of the same cDNA, lacking an 85-nucleotide exon and leading to an early stop codon. Here we show that epithelial cells, in which the HGF receptor is naturally expressed, contain FAP68 and not FAP48 proteins. FAP68 binding to Met requires the last 30 amino acids of the C-terminal tail, which are unique to the HGF receptor. Indeed, FAP68 does not interact with related tyrosine kinases of the Met and insulin receptor families. FAP68 interacts specifically with the inactive form of HGF receptor, such as a kinase-defective receptor or a dephosphorylated wild type receptor. In vivo, endogenous FAP68 can be coimmunoprecipitated with the HGF receptor in the absence of stimuli and not upon HGF stimulation. Thus, FAP68 represents a novel type of effector that interacts with the inactive HGF receptor and is released upon receptor phosphorylation. Free FAP68 exerts a specific stimulatory activity toward the downstream target p70 S6 protein kinase (p70S6K). Significantly, nonphosphorylated HGF receptor prevents FAP68 from stimulating p70S6K.

The complex, pleiotropic effects of HGF suggest that there may be additional signal transducers and effectors still to be discovered. In this study we performed a genetic screen with the yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel proteins capable of associating with the unstimulated HGF receptor. We cloned a cDNA coding for a 68-kDa cytoplasmic protein, FAP68, which is specifically bound by the nonphosphorylated form of the HGF receptor and is released upon HGF stimulation and receptor phosphorylation. We provide evidence that forced expression of FAP68 in epithelial cells induces phosphorylation of p70S6K, without affecting the MAPK pathway. Co-transfection of nonphosphorylated HGF receptor prevents FAP68 from stimulating p70S6K. These findings suggest a potential role for FAP68 in linking HGF signaling to the regulation of protein synthesis. To perform a yeast interaction trap screening (18Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 20.1.1-20.1.28Google Scholar), the cDNA encoding for the HGF receptor intracellular domain carrying a mutation in the ATP-binding site (Lys1110 → Ala) was generated by PCR from the corresponding full-length construct in pMT2 vector (19Crepaldi T. Prat M. Giordano S. Medico E. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1750-1755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was sequenced and inserted in pEG202 vector, fused to the LexA DNA-binding (IC-KD bait). The Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain EGY48 was co-transformed with the bait and the lacZreporter pSH18–34. Yeast cells were then transformed with a HeLa cDNA library (from Roger Brent) in vector pJG4–5 using the lithium acetate method (20Gietz D., St Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Over 2 million transformants were obtained and screened. Among the 700 yeast colonies isolated as Leu-positive, 35 were found to display both leucine prototrophy and lacZexpression only upon specific induction of the library expression with galactose. Plasmid DNA was rescued from these colonies and used for transformation of the reporter strain in combination with the IC-KD bait or with unrelated bait, pEG202-bicoid. Fourteen clones remained specifically positive. From restriction mapping it appeared that four groups of cDNAs, encoding distinct proteins, had been isolated (to be described elsewhere). The cDNA inserts from specific clones were sequenced using the ABI Prism™ 301 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Clone T291, which is redundant with three other independent clones, was selected for the present study. To obtain the 5′ sequence of cloneT291, 5′-RACE-PCR on HeLa Marathon-Ready™ cDNA (CLONTECH) was performed, using as gene-specific primer an oligonucleotide annealing inside the 85-bp sequence present in FAP68 but absent from FAP48 (5′-GCCTCCACACCTGAGTGATTACTTG-3′). Of the 17 5′ cDNAs that were retrieved, the 4 longest started at nucleotide 12 of the published FAP48 sequence (GenBank™ accession no. U73704), and were identical to it. We performed a 3′-RACE-PCR using as gene-specific primer an oligonucleotide annealing within the 5′-untranslated region (5′-GAGGGTTCTGGCCGATTTTAGCAT-3′). All 20 3′ cDNAs that were retrieved had the same size and contained the 85-bp sequence. The various HGF receptor regions were generated by PCR from a human full-length Met(21Giordano S. Zhen Z.

HEK-293 cells used in this study express the SV40 large T antigen (kindly provided by Dr. L. Naldini). Cultures of mammalian cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2air. Insect Sf9 cells were maintained in serum-free medium (SF900; Life Technologies, Inc.) and baculovirus-infected according to Invitrogen instructions. For transient transfection experiments, subconfluent COS-7 and HEK-293 cells were transfected by DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation method. 5 μg of each cDNA were used, unless indicated. Cells from 10-cm plates were lysed after 36–48 h from transfection. HBD lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, KOH, pH 7.8, 75 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors) was used for association studies. Modified EB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors) was used for phosphorylation studies. The control GST protein was obtained by pGEX vector transformation of BL-21 cells and induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were then lysed with B-PER (Pierce). The GST-fused intracellular domain of wild type HGF receptor was expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus system and purified. Briefly, infected cells were lysed with EB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) in the presence (GST-phospho-IC) or absence (GST-dephospho-IC) of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with EB buffer. The GST-phospho-IC was directly eluted with glutathione, whereas the GST-dephospho-IC was dephosphorylated with 20 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Promega) in buffer for dephosphorylation (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), at 15 °C for 16 h. After two washings with EB buffer, the protein was eluted with 50 mm glutathione and 100 mm HEPES (pH 8). Labeled proteins were prepared by transcription and translation ofFAP68-VSVG in pcDNA3 vector, in the presence of [35S]methionine/cysteine, using the TNT T7 coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The translated lysates were diluted in HBD with 0.1% Triton X-100 and used directly in binding assay. GST alone or GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads at 1 μm and incubated with diluted lysates overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with HBD with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer, run in SDS-PAGE, and detected by fluorography. HEK-293 cells were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 24 h. Before cell lysis, cells were stimulated with 30 ng/ml HGF or not stimulated. Cells from two 10-cm plates were lysed with HBD, 0.5% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of α-HGF receptor DO24 ascites or mouse nonimmune serum as control, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibody. All reagents used were from Fluka and Sigma. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were from Bio-Rad. Recombinant HGF from the baculovirus expression system and α-HGF receptor monoclonal antibodies (DQ13 and DO24) have been described previously (24Naldini L. Vigna E. Bardelli A. Follenzi A. Galimi F.

The α-Glu monoclonal antibody directed against the Glu epitope and the α-p70α rabbit antiserum were obtained from the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (London, United Kingdom). α-FAP polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits using aa 194–212 as immunogen. α-Phosphopeptide antibody against Thr412 of p70S6K (α-T412P; New England Biolabs), α-phosphotyrosine antibody (α-PY; Upstate Biotechnology), and α-active-MAPK antibody (Promega) were used. For co-precipitation studies, cell extracts were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C with antibodies coupled to Sepharose-protein A or with glutathione-Sepharose. Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer and samples eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Eluted proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with specific primary and secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions and visualized on Amersham Hyperfilm. To identify target proteins that interact with the intracellular portion of the HGF receptor, we used the yeast Interaction Trap system (18Golemis E.A. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 20.1.1-20.1.28Google Scholar). Because there are already many known Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine B transducers that bind the tyrosine-phosphorylated HGF receptor, we screened for proteins that recognize the nonphosphorylated intracellular domain. To this aim a bait was produced by fusing the LexA DNA-binding domain with a cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, carrying the Lys1110 → Ala inactivating mutation in the ATP-binding site (IC-KD bait; see Fig. 2 A). This mutation is sufficient to completely switch off the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor. Over 2 million cDNA clones from a HeLa cDNA expression library were screened; of the 700 yeast colonies selected, 14 were positive after two rounds of transformation. From restriction maps it appeared that four groups of cDNA encoding distinct proteins had been isolated. The complete sequencing of clone T291 and comparison with the GenBank nucleotide data base using BLAST showed that T291 is homologous to a previously identified human cDNA sequence called FAP48 (forFKBP-associated protein48; GenBank™ accession no. U73704, Ref. 26Chambraud B. Radanyi C. Camonis J.H. Shazand K. Rajkowski K. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32923-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).T291 starts at nucleotide 165 of the FAP48sequence. The two sequences are identical up to nucleotide 1307. After 85 nucleotides, absent from the FAP48 sequence,T291 resumes its identity with FAP48(1308–1834), except for the lack of nucleotide 1573. The full-size cDNA, obtained by RACE-PCR from HeLa cells, includes an open reading frame of 1785 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 594 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 68,204 kDa (Fig.1 A). It was therefore namedFAP68. Several human expressed sequence tags contain the 85-bp sequence and the single base pair deletion present inFAP68. A cDNA clone from a placental library (GenBank™ accession no. AAH01257), recently deposited in GenBank™, is identical to FAP68 cDNA. The genomic fragment of chromosome 1 (GenBank™ accession no. AC024010), deposited at the High Throughput Genomic Sequences division of GenBank™, contains the FAPgene. In the genomic sequence, canonical consensus splice sites (AG at the 3′ splice site and GT at the 5′ splice site) flank the 85-bp segment. Therefore, the previously published FAP48 sequence derives from an alternatively spliced transcript that removes the 85-nucleotide exon and leads to a premature stop codon. 3′-RACE-PCR analysis of HeLa transcripts indicated the presence of a homogeneous population of FAP68 mRNA. No transcript corresponding toFAP48 was found. To determine whether the two protein products were expressed in cells, a polyclonal antibody was raised against a peptide encompassing aa 194–212, common to FAP68 and FAP48. In an immunoblot of a panel of epithelial cell lines, the immune serum recognized a major band migrating in SDS-PAGE as a closely spaced doublet of ∼65 kDa (Fig.1 B). The interaction between FAP68 protein and HGF receptor was further studied by co-transforming yeast with clone T291 (aa 25–594) and various receptor mutants (Fig.2 A). A bait containing the intracellular portion of wild type HGF receptor constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine (IC bait, Fig. 2 B) failed to interact with clone T291 (Fig. 2 C). This indicates that binding is prevented by tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor. Two deletion mutants were derived from the kinase-defective receptor used in the original screening (IC-KD bait): TKC lacking the juxtamembrane domain, and JTK lacking the C-terminal tail (Fig.2 A). Of these, only TKC interacted with cloneT291 (Fig. 2 C), thus indicating that binding requires the C-terminal tail. Indeed, the last 57 amino acids of the receptor (C57 bait) showed a positive interaction, although weaker than that detected in the presence of the catalytic domain. The C-terminal tail containing the two tyrosines Tyr1349 and Tyr1356 of the multifunctional docking site but devoid of last 30 amino acids (C27 bait) failed to interact with cloneT291. This indicates that the last 30 amino acids of the C-terminal tail are required for binding. On the FAP68 side, we generated various deletion mutants and found that the intact molecule is required for specific binding to the receptor, except for the first 25 amino acids, which are dispensable (data not shown). The specificity of the interaction was assessed by testing baits containing the cytoplasmic domain of Ron, a Met subfamily member, and two related tyrosine kinases, the IGF-1R and the insulin receptor. Neither wild type nor kinase-defective receptors (carrying a mutated ATP binding site) did bind FAP68 (data not shown). The interaction between FAP68 and HGF receptor was investigated in mammalian cells in vivo (Fig.3). As observed in yeast, in co-transfected COS-7 cells, GST-tagged FAP68 interacted with the kinase-defective but not with the kinase-active wild type HGF receptor (Fig. 3 A), which in COS-7 cells is autophosphorylated as consequence of overexpression (27Bardelli A. Maina F. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Comoglio P.M. Ponzetto C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1973-1978PubMed Google Scholar). Identical results were obtained when TprMet was used (Fig. 3 B). TprMet is a hybrid molecule, encoded by the TPR-MET transforming gene (28Cooper C.S. Park M. Blair D.G. Tainsky M.A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Vande W. Nature. 1984; 311: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar); the extracellular domain of Met receptor is replaced by Tpr sequences, which provide two strong dimerization motifs (29Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), followed by the Met kinase domain and C-terminal tail. In the TprMetD mutant, the two critical tyrosines of the multifunctional docking site (corresponding to the Tyr1349/Tyr1356 in the full-size receptor) were converted into phenylalanine (3Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. Dalla Zonca Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). This Tyr → Phe conversion abrogates signaling, but does not affect the TprMetD catalytic activity and constitutive phosphorylation of other sites. Neither TprMetD nor TprMetWTwere able to bind FAP68-GST (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that the phosphorylated HGF receptor cannot bind FAP68 because of structural changes in the C-terminal tail rather than steric blockade by phosphotyrosine residues of the multifunctional docking site. The interaction between FAP68 and nonphosphorylated wild type HGF receptor was confirmed in vitro, using purified molecules. The intracellular domain of wild type HGF receptor, purified from baculovirus-infected cell lysates and constitutively phosphorylated (GST-phospho-IC), did not interact with in vitro translated and radiolabeled FAP68 (Fig. 4). However, following dephosphorylation by phosphatase treatment, GST-dephospho-IC acquired the ability of binding FAP68. This confirms that FAP68 binding is specific for the nonphosphorylated HGF receptor and that the interaction of the kinase-defective mutant is not the result of the introduced mutation in the ATP-binding site. To determine, under physiological conditions, whether the association between FAP68 and the HGF receptor depends on receptor phosphorylation, we examined the interaction between the two endogenous proteins in serum-starved and HGF-stimulated HEK-293 cells. The HGF receptor was immunoprecipitated with DO24 monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor extracellular domain. This antibody preferentially reacts with the phosphorylated Met receptor (25Prat M. Crepaldi T. Pennacchietti S. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 237-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immune complex was analyzed by immunoblotting with α-FAP polyclonal antiserum. Coimmunoprecipitation of FAP68 was observed with the nonphosphorylated HGF receptor but was no longer detected in the immune complex after HGF stimulation (Fig. 5 A). We then investigated whether FAP68 was phosphorylated upon HGF receptor activation. FAP68 was immunoprecipitated with α-FAP antiserum from serum-starved and HGF-stimulated HEK-293 cells. The immune complex was analyzed by immunoblotting with α-FAP and α-phosphotyrosine antibodies. We found that following HGF stimulation a fraction of FAP68 protein underwent a gel migration shift and became tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 5 B). This indicates thatin vivo FAP68 released from the receptor upon HGF receptor activation is tyrosine-phosphorylated. We then investigated whether free FAP68 might have a role in the signal transduction pathways stimulated by the HGF receptor. We analyzed the effect of FAP68 on p70S6K, a downstream target of PI3K, and on MAPK, a downstream target of Ras. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with p70S6K and FAP68, or p70S6K and empty vector as a control, serum-starved for 16 h, and analyzed for basal p70S6K activity. In vivo, p70S6K activity is closely related to the state of phosphorylation of Thr412 (30Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Pearson R.B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14845-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of Thr412, we observed that co-expression of FAP68 with p70S6K stimulated phosphorylation of Thr412 (Fig. 6 A). The stimulation was comparable with that induced by addition of fetal calf serum to control cells. The effect of FAP68 was specific, as co-expression of ezrin did not result in increased p70S6K phosphorylation (data not shown). The same type of analysis was performed on endogenous p70S6K in HEK-293 cells overexpressing FAP68 and GFP. In experiments where the transfection efficiency was close to 90%, Thr412 phosphorylation and a shift of p70S6K were clearly detectable with the appropriate antibodies (Fig.6 B). We then examined the effect of FAP68 on p44 MAPK. Co-transfection with FAP68 failed to activate MAPK, as assessed by immunoblot with specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of MAPK (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that FAP68 does not have a general activating effect on cellular kinases but rather specifically stimulates p70S6K phosphorylation. We consequently asked whether the stimulatory activity of FAP68 toward p70S6K could be regulated by the interaction between FAP68 and the HGF receptor. FAP68 (or empty vector as a control), p70S6K, and the kinase-defective mutant TprMetKD were co-expressed in HEK-293 cells, and p70S6K phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form of Thr412. The ability of FAP68 to increase the level of the p70S6K phosphorylation was abrogated in the presence of the kinase-defective TprMet mutant (Fig. 7). Wild type TprMet is inappropriate as a control for this experiment, because it can enhance the p70S6K by stimulation of the PI3K pathway. We thus used the TprMetD mutant, unable to signal through the tyrosines Tyr1349/Tyr1356 of the multifunctional docking site, mutated into phenylalanines. TprMetD did not bind FAP68 (see Fig. 3 B) and did not interfere with the up-regulation of p70S6K activation induced by FAP68. In this paper we have identified by interaction screening a novel protein of 68 kDa (FAP68), which specifically interacts with the HGF receptor. A splice variant, FAP48, was previously found by two-hybrid screening using FKBP52 protein as a bait (26Chambraud B. Radanyi C. Camonis J.H. Shazand K. Rajkowski K. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32923-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that this lower molecular mass form results from an off-frame truncation of the FAP68 transcript. Using antibodies against common peptides, we have shown that FAP68 is widely distributed in human epithelial cells, whereas FAP48 is undetectable. The high level of expression of FAP68 in epithelial cells, where HGF receptor is predominantly found, supports the idea that it may function in HGF signaling. The interaction between FAP68 and the HGF receptor is direct and occurs with the nonphosphorylated receptor. More than one region of FAP68 is likely to contribute to formation of the receptor-binding site, because the cleavage of the molecule into two halves abrogates binding. The last 57 amino acids of the HGF receptor C-terminal tail contain a minimal binding site for FAP68, and the last 30 amino acids are an essential component of this site. This region of 30 residues in the C-terminal tail diverges even among members of the Met receptor family, suggesting that FAP68 binding may be a unique property of the HGF receptor. The sequence recognized by FAP68 is next to the region of the Met multifunctional docking site, involved in binding the Src homology 2- and phosphotyrosine B-containing effectors (3Ponzetto C. Bardelli A. Zhen Z. Maina F. Dalla Zonca Giordano S. Graziani A. Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation inhibits FAP68 binding. This is not caused by steric hindrance of the phosphorylated tail residues Tyr1349 and Tyr1356, as a mutant lacking these two tyrosines but still kinase-active (TprMetD) does not bind FAP68. Rather, conformational changes in the C-terminal tail of the receptor following activation are likely to inhibit binding and to induce release of FAP68. Interestingly, upon ligand-induced receptor activation, FAP68 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated. This modification, in addition to changes in Met structure, may contribute to the release of FAP68. Release of FAP68 may expose a site on the receptor to which another effector may bind. In this case FAP68 may serve as an inhibitor of signaling prior to receptor activation. This is an attractive hypothesis, considering that the HGF receptor C-terminal tail is the organizing center for the assembly of large signaling complexes proximal to the receptor. Alternatively, the regulated release may serve to allow FAP68 to move to its site of action. A number of signaling mechanisms dependent on phosphorylation-induced release have been described. An example is the activation of the Stat pathway. Here, the phosphorylated receptor recruits the Src homology 2-containing transcription factor to the membrane and phosphorylates it, inducing dimerization and release into the cytoplasm. Then, the dimer migrates to the nucleus and activates transcription (32Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Another example is activation of Smad transcription factors, which are released from the transforming growth factor-β family receptors upon phosphorylation on serine residues and translocated into the nucleus where they induce transcription (33Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some cytoplasmic molecules have been shown to specifically interact with nonphosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors. For instance, a cell cycle checkpoint regulatory protein, MAD2, is released from the insulin receptor after activation (34O'Neill T.J. Zhu Y. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10035-10040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and a zinc finger protein selectively binds the unstimulated epidermal growth factor receptor and translocates to the nucleus upon release from the activated receptor (35Galcheva-Gargova Z. Konstantinov K.N. Wu I.H. Klier F.G. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1797-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The important question that remains open is the real function of FAP68 and its role in HGF signaling. Very little is known of this protein. It has no substantial similarities with already known sequences, except for the FAP48 isoform. It shares with FAP48 (26Chambraud B. Radanyi C. Camonis J.H. Shazand K. Rajkowski K. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32923-32929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) the ability to associate with the FKBP proteins, the targets of immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin, using a putative rapamycin/FK506 mimetic structure (data not shown). This raises the possibility that FAP48 and/or FAP68 act in the signal transduction pathways targeted by FK506 and/or rapamycin. Here we show that FAP68 exerts a specific effect on p70S6K. The detailed biochemical mechanisms by which FAP68 up-regulates p70S6K are presently unclear. Regardless of the mechanism, FAP68 binding with the nonphosphorylated HGF receptor prevents its stimulatory activity toward p70S6K. Activation of p70S6K is essential for HGF-induced hepatocyte proliferation (40). Met can activate p70S6K via PI3K (8Graziani A. Gramaglia D. Cantley L.C. Comoglio P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22087-22090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the release of FAP68 from the activated receptor may synergize with PI3K to reinforce HGF-induced p70S6K signaling (13Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This occurs via phosphorylation of Thr412, which is controlled by upstream kinase(s) (37Thomas G. Hall M.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and by serine/threonine phosphatase(s) inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin TOR (38Peterson R.T. Beal P.A. Comb M.J.

Ther. 1997; 282: 1146-1154PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing idea could be that FAP68 may participate in the cellular regulation of mammalian TOR. Work is in progress to investigate whether FAP68 is functionally linked with TOR or is involved in different aspects of HGF signaling.

Both ferredoxins serve a crucial role as electron donors for reductive carboxylation, catalyzed by a key enzyme of this pathway, pyruvate synthase/pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase.

Further spectroscopic studies indicated that the CD spectrum of oxidized Fd I closely resembled that of Fd II; however, both spectra appeared to be unique relative to ferredoxins studied previously. Double integration of the EPR signal of the two Fds yielded approximately ∼2.0 spins per molecule, compatible with the idea that C. tepidum Fd I and Fd II accept 2 electrons upon reduction.

The results of amino acid sequence alignments, molecular modeling, oxidation-reduction potentials, and spectral properties strongly indicate that the C. tepidumFds are chimeras of both clostridial-type and chromatium-type Fds, suggesting that the two Fds are likely intermediates in the evolutional development of 2[4Fe-4S] clusters compared with the well described clostridial and chromatium types.

Despite the importance of this process in nature, many key aspects of the biochemistry and molecular control of this process are unknown.Chlorobium tepidum provides a particularly intriguing model system as this anaerobic phototrophic green sulfur bacterium grows rapidly to high densities and is the only known RTCA pathway organism that possesses a potentially useful genetic system (1Wahlund T.M. Woese C.R. Castenholz R.W. Madigan M.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1991; 156: 81-90Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). By using the enzyme ATP-dependent citrate lyase (2Wahlund T.M. Tabita F.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C. tepidum and other RTCA organisms convert citrate to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The acetyl-CoA produced by this reaction may then be used as a CO2 acceptor in a unique ferredoxin (Fd)-linked carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme pyruvate synthase (PS)/pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) (Reaction 1). This enzyme is analogous to another key CO2fixation enzyme of this pathway, α-ketoglutarate synthase (KGS)/α-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (KGOR) (Reaction 2)acetyl­CoA+CO2+H++Fdred↔pyruvate+coenzyme A+FdoxREACTION 1 succinyl­CoA+CO2+H++Fdred↔α­ketoglutarate+coenzyme A+FdoxREACTION 2 Both enzymes require a source of reducing equivalents to function in the CO2 fixation direction (PS and KGS), and both enzymes transfer reducing equivalents to discrete electron acceptors for decarboxylation (PFOR and KGOR). Recently, we have shown (3Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that a novel low potential rubredoxin from C. tepidum is a favored electron acceptor for PS/PFOR in the pyruvate oxidation reaction. Moreover, it has been shown unequivocally that the C. tepidum enzyme, which is a homodimer of a single polypeptide chain, catalyzes both the PS and PFOR reactions. Rubredoxin, however, was unable to serve as the electron donor for the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA in the PS reaction. Undoubtedly then, a much more electronegative electron carrier is required for this enzymatic reaction, and our initial results (3Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicated that two different ferredoxins isolated from this organism could perform this function. These preliminary results, with purified preparations, are in agreement with studies performed many years ago (4Evans M.C.W. Buchanan B.B. Arnon D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In these earlier studies, unpurified preparations of both PS and KGS were shown to require reduced ferredoxin. From the above studies, it is reasonable to assume that PS/PFOR and KGS/KGOR each require one or more highly electronegative electron donors to function in CO2 assimilation. Flavodoxin (7Hughes N.J.

To study further the biochemistry of the RTCA cycle, particularly in C. tepidum, we attempted to isolate and analyze low potential electron carriers from this organism that might function in the RTCA cycle. It is well known that the small protein Fd has one or more iron-sulfur clusters involved in electron transfer. This well studied protein has been isolated from many different organisms, and several years ago two different ferredoxins, Fd I and Fd II, were isolated from the green sulfur bacterium C. limicola. In this earlier study, however, only the amino acid sequences were reported (15Tanaka M. Haniu M. Yasunobu K.T. Evans M.C. Rao K.K. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2953-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and no biochemical, spectroscopic, or physiological properties were noted. Certainly it is known that Fd may have several specific functions. This protein is particularly required by microbial systems that catalyze electron transfer processes, including CO2 reduction, N2 fixation, sulfite reduction, NAD(P) reduction, photophosphorylation, and the fermentation of organic compounds (16Sticht H.

Plant-type Fds contain [2Fe-2S] active redox centers, whereas bacterial-type Fds have [3Fe-4S] and one or two [4Fe-4S] cubane clusters in their active sites. Each cluster is capable of serving as a one-electron carrier. A single organism may possess numerous Fds, which are distinguished by their unique spectroscopic properties, protein sequences, reduction potentials, and [Fe-S] clusters, among other biochemical and physiological properties (16Sticht H.

In bacteria, one or two [4Fe-4S]2+/1+clusters are commonly known as either general clostridial-type Fds or chromatium-type Fds. The [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster of clostridial-type contains a Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro motif for cluster ligation and has been structurally characterized (16Sticht H. Rosch P. Prog.

The chromatium-type Fds possess specific differences in the second [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster as well as having a longer extension at the C terminus. Notably they utilize a Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys- Xaa7–9-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-Pro motif for cluster ligation, having 5–6 amino acids more than the clostridial-type between the second and third cysteines at the C terminus. The exception is the archaeal ferredoxin from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain ΔH (27Steigerwald V.J. Pihl T.D. Reeve J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Monocluster Fds from Pyrococcus furiosus,Thermotaga maritima, and Hydrogenobacter thermophilus were found to act as electron transfer proteins between PFOR and a terminal hydrogenase (24Ishii M.

The reduction potentials of these chromatium-type Fds ranged from −280 to −486 mV for cluster I and from −530 to −660 mV for cluster II. These properties are very different from the clostridial-type Fd, which shows a single transition of two clusters around −400 to −450 mV (31Smith E.T. Feinberg B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14371-14376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Camba R. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10587-10598Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the current study, we report on the properties of two different Fd proteins from C. tepidum, Fd I and Fd II, which contain two [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ clusters and resemble the general chromatium-type Fd. These two C. tepidum Fds, however, possess intriguing spectroscopic, biochemical, and physiological properties and appear to be chimeras of the well characterized clostridial- and chromatium-type proteins. These proteins thus raise intriguing evolutional questions and suggest that the C. tepidum Fds are intermediates in the development of important 2[4Fe-4S]-type Fds, which eventually evolved into the clostridial- and chromatium-types by gene duplication events. Finally, the results of this study present the initial detailed description of the spectroscopic and biochemical properties of these unique Fds from green sulfur bacteria; the possible functional role and biological activity of 2[4Fe-4S] cluster Fds in autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism are indicated. C. tepidum strain TLS was grown photoautotrophically in 20-liter Carboy bottles according to a modification of a method described previously (3Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested anaerobically using continuous centrifugation at 35,000 × g at 4 °C under a flow of nitrogen gas. The harvested cells were washed twice with anaerobic 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mmdithiothreitol. The cells were then resuspended in the same buffer (1 g of wet weight cells per 4 ml of buffer), after which the cell suspension was disrupted by 2 passes through a French pressure cell at 10,000 pounds/square inch under a flow of argon gas. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 10 min); the supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1.5 h. The supernatant fraction from this step was used for the purification. All purification procedures were carried out at room temperature under strictly anaerobic conditions using a Coy anaerobic chamber under an atmosphere of 95% nitrogen and 5% hydrogen. All buffers were repeatedly degassed and flushed with argon and were stored in the anaerobic chamber. Protein purification was performed in the Coy anaerobic chamber using the Biological Autoprogram System from Bio-Rad. The supernatant after ultracentrifugation was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (2.5 × 20 cm), pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with 150 ml of the same buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 7 ml per min, followed by elution with 600 ml of a linear gradient of 0.2-0.5 m NaCl prepared in the same buffer. Two dark brown colored proteins were eluted in distinct peaks and diluted 2-fold with salt-free buffer and separately applied to a Q-Sepharose high performance column (1.6 × 12 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. After loading, the column was washed with buffer and protein eluted using buffer containing 0.3m NaCl followed by a gradient of buffer containing 0.3–0.5m NaCl at a flow rate of 3 ml per min. At this stage, protein-containing fractions were concentrated using Centrifree-5 cartridges (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superose-12 column (1.6 × 50 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1.0 ml per min. Protein purity was established by SDS-PAGE analysis using gels containing 20% acrylamide. Subsequent analyses indicated that the two dark-brown pigmented proteins were distinct ferredoxins, Fd I and Fd II. C. tepidum PS/PFOR was also purified under anaerobic conditions from the same crude cell extract, as described elsewhere. 2K.-S. Yoon and F. R. Tabita, manuscript in preparation. Preliminary results were presented at the Gordon Research Conference on the Molecular Basis of Microbial One-Carbon Metabolism, June 28–July 3, 1998, Henniker, NH. The function of Fd as an electron acceptor for PFOR was determined spectrophotometrically either by direct measurement of Fd reduction or by coupling the reoxidation of reduced Fd to the reduction of metronidazole (1-[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole, MNZ). The standard assay mixture contained 10 mm pyruvate, 0.5 mmcoenzyme A, PFOR (15 nm), 1 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm ThDP in 100 mmHEPES buffer in anaerobic cuvettes under argon, pH 7.6, at 48 °C (3Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic parameters of PFOR for Fd I and Fd II were determined by measuring MNZ-mediated activity of Fd I and Fd II catalyzed by PFOR. In the coupled assay, MNZ (100 μm) was added to the above reaction mixture, and the activity was measured by following MNZ reduction at 320 nm. Oxidized MNZ is reported to have a molar absorption coefficient of 9300 m−1cm−1 (38Chen J.-S. Blanchard D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it is assumed to be a one-electron process (39Moreno S.N. Mason R.P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8252-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The direct reduction of Fd I and Fd II by PFOR was measured at 395 nm. The molar absorption coefficients used for calculating PFOR activity using Fd I and Fd II were determined to be 10,110 and 8,030m−1 cm−1 which were between fully oxidized and reduced forms, respectively, and 31,6000 and 30,900 mm−1 cm−1 when oxidized. The specific activity was expressed as units/mg PFOR, where 1 unit is equivalent to the reduction of 1 μmol of Fd per min at 395 nm. PFOR had a specific activity of 6.3 units/mg when using methyl viologen as an electron accepter at 48 °C. Cytoplasmic hydrogenase was partially purified from the supernatant fraction obtained after ultracentrifugation followed by DEAE-Sepharose fast flow and Q-Sepharose high performance chromatography. Hydrogenase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using benzyl viologen as an electron acceptor in an anaerobic cell under argon at 48 °C (40Florin L. Tsokoglou A. Happe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6125-6132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were obtained with a Brüker Instruments ER 300 spectrometer equipped with ER 035M NMR gaussmeter and a Hewlett-Packard 5352B microwave frequency counter. Double integration of the EPR spectra was performed with the ESP 300 software package from Brüker Instruments. Air-oxidized Fd was placed into quartz EPR tubes and frozen by slowly immersing the tubes into liquid nitrogen. Samples of reduced Fd were prepared under anaerobic conditions, using either an enzymatic protocol in which the activity of PFOR was used to reduce the Fd, or by chemical means by the addition of sodium dithionite. The reduced liquid samples were collected directly into EPR tubes and sealed with a rubber stopper; the samples were then frozen at specific times after mixing in a dry ice/acetone bath. EPR spectra were measured at 5–20 K using the following settings: 10 milliwatts microwave power, 10 G modulation amplitude, 100 kHz modulation frequency. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of oxidized Fds were measured at room temperature with an AVIV 62DS Spectropolarimeter. CD data were collected at a scan rate of 1 nm/s; spectra reported represent the average of three scans. UV-visible spectra were measured with a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments). Purified holoFd I and Fd II (1 mg) were placed in argon-flushed stoppered tubes in an ice bath. To these preparations, an aliquot of 12 n HCl was added to a final concentration of 0.5 n; incubation was continued at 0 °C with continuous stirring under argon for 45 min. The slurry was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the white pellet was quickly rinsed with demineralized double distilled water and dissolved in degassed 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Treatment with HCl was repeated as before, and the resultant precipitate was dissolved in 200 μl of degassed 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m NaCl and incubated for at least 30 min under anaerobic conditions under argon. Midpoint reduction potentials of Fd I and Fd II (in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) were measured by cyclic voltammetry with a glassy carbon electrode. The scan rate was 20 mV/s over the potential range −200 to −900 mV (versus the Ag/AgCl electrode) at room temperature. The electrochemical cell and the procedure have been described (41Brereton P.S. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7351-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All values were referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of Fd I and Fd II were determined at the University of California, Davis, Protein Sequencing Facility after blotting samples to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (42Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total amino acid compositions of Fd I and Fd II were determined at the Ohio State University Protein Sequencing Facility (43Moore S. Stein W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1963; 6: 819-831Crossref Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were routinely estimated by established procedures (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The iron content of the protein was determined by the o-phenanthroline procedure (45Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labile sulfur was also determined using a colorimetric method (46Chen J.-S. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 79: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The molecular weights of Fd I and Fd II were determined by gel filtration using a Superose-12 HR (10/30) column and the Biological Autoprogram System of Bio-Rad calibrated with β-amylase (Mr = 200,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr = 67,000), carbonic anhydrase (Mr = 29,000), cytochrome c(Mr = 12,400), and aprotinin (Mr = 6,500). In all cases, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing either 0.1 or 1.0 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol was used as the eluate buffer. While investigating the structure-function relationships of the key RTCA cycle enzymes PS/PFOR and KGS/KGOR from C. tepidum, several small iron-sulfur proteins including two rubredoxins, two ferredoxins, Fd I and Fd II, plus other proteins were isolated. These iron-sulfur proteins were all shown to be important for CO2 fixation (via PS and KGS) as well as light-dependent energy generation in this organism (3Yoon K.S. Hille R. Hemann C. Tabita F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29772-29778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To assess the precise roles of these ancillary proteins in facilitating CO2 fixation via the RTCA cycle proteins PS and KGS, it was necessary to fully characterize these small proteins. A purification scheme was devised for Fd I and Fd II consisting of sequential steps of DEAE-Sepharose fast flow, Q-Sepharose high performance, and Superose-12 chromatography, all performed in a Coy chamber under strictly anaerobic conditions at room temperature. The first purification step, DEAE-Sepharose fast flow chromatography, separated several types of colored proteins that were pink or dark-brown, typical of iron-sulfur proteins. To isolate the [4Fe-4S] cluster-type Fd from C. tepidum, two major dark-brown proteins of low molecular weight, as determined by gel filtration, were further purified. The major portion of the two Fds eluted at a concentration of 0.35–0.40 m NaCl after DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. After Q-Sepharose high performance column chromatography, Fd I and Fd II eluted at 0.36–0.39 and 0.39–0.42m NaCl, respectively, at a salt conductivity between 22.9 and 28.2 ms/cm (Fig. 1 A). The proteins were concentrated to 2 ml and then loaded onto a Superose-12 column. The protein purity after Superose-12 chromatography was determined using 20% SDS-PAGE gels. Fd I and Fd II migrated with the dye front, even at this high concentration of acrylamide. However, apoFd I and apoFd II, prepared under strictly anaerobic conditions, exhibited molecular masses of ∼8–8.5 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 B). The protein bands of holo- and apoFd II were less intense than those of Fd I using Coomassie R-250 staining, which is often the case for acidic low molecular weight proteins or peptides (19Seo D. Tomioka A. Kusumoto N. Kamo M. Enami I. Sakurai H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ApoFds were prepared under strictly anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere in an ice bath. In the presence of air, apoFds were shown to be degraded during the iron removal procedure. The molecular weights of Fd I and Fd II, determined by gel filtration in the presence of 1.0 m NaCl, were estimated to be ∼9,000 ± 1,000 and 8,500 ± 1,000, respectively. In the presence of 0.1m NaCl, the molecular weights increased to 20,000 ± 2,000 and 19,000 ± 2,000, respectively, indicating"

Attention now focuses on understanding how cells react to the presence of the cisplatin-DNA lesions and, using this information, designing more effective anticancer treatments. Upon cisplatin binding, the DNA duplex is bent and unwound, and the minor groove becomes wide and shallow.

The identification and characterization of proteins that bind selectively to cisplatin-damaged DNA has therefore become one of the main thrusts of research in this field. The TATA-binding protein (TBP)1 is a key component of transcription factor IID, which is required for transcription initiation of all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases (15Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As the first step in the process, TBP recognizes a TATA box element located ∼30 base pairs (bp) upstream from the transcription start site and eventually recruits other transcription factors. Structural analyses of several TBP-TATA box complexes reveal that TBP binds at a widened minor groove and bends the duplex DNA toward the major groove by intercalation of two pairs of phenylalanine residues (16Patikoglou G.A. Kim J.L. Sun L. Yang S.H. Kodadek T. Burley S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3217-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Hoffman A. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Proc.

Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Because sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins usually reside in the major groove, the minor groove binding by TBP was initially puzzling. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the flexibility of the TATA box element primarily determines its binding affinity to TBP (19Juo Z.S. Chiu T.K. Leiberman P.M. Baikalov I. Berk A.J. Dickerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Grove A. Galeone A. Yu E. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition to the specificity of its DNA binding, TBP has distinctive DNA binding kinetics. The formation of the TBP-DNA complex is characterized by relatively slow on and off rates (21Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TBP binds selectively to cisplatin-damaged DNA (22Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The sequestration of TBP by cisplatin DNA adducts inhibits transcription in vitro, which could be restored in a reconstituted system by addition of extra TBP (22Vichi P. Coin F. Renaud J.P. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Moras D. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7444-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Transcription inhibition by exogenously added cisplatin-damaged DNA has also been reported (23Cullinane C. Mazur S.J. Essigmann J.M. Phillips D.R. Bohr V.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6204-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More recently, enhanced binding of TBP to the TATA element containing flanking cisplatin 1,2-intrastrand cross-links was demonstrated (24Cohen S.M. Jamieson E.J. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8259-8265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This series of experiments suggests a possible role for TBP-cisplatin-DNA ternary complexes in mediating the anticancer activity of the drug. Because a variety of proteins interact with cisplatin-DNA adducts (9Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), many studies have focused on determining their binding affinities (25Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 26Dunham S.U. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11428-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 27McA'Nulty M.M.

To evaluate the relative importance of the different protein-platinated DNA interactions in the cell, however, detailed kinetic parameters are also required. Despite the importance of such information, few attempts have been made to examine the kinetics of protein binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA (31Jamieson E.R. Jacobson M.P. Barnes C.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12346-12354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22630-22637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The interactions between the two domains (A and B) of HMGB1 with cisplatin-modified DNA were investigated by using stopped-flow fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer methods (31Jamieson E.R. Jacobson M.P. Barnes C.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12346-12354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8426-8438Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, a stopped-flow kinetic analysis was performed for replication protein A (RPA) binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA (33Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22630-22637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study we employed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to examine the kinetics of TBP binding to cisplatin-damaged DNA and, for comparison purposes, the TATA box. TBP binding to DNA containing a site-specific 1,2-intrastrand d(GpG) cross-link was evaluated by using several platinum-modified DNA probes with various flanking sequences. We also performed an in vitro repair assay to examine the effect of TBP in modulating nucleotide excision repair (NER) of platinated DNA. The results provide strong evidence for a biological role of TBP in mediating the cytotoxicity of cisplatin. The C-terminal DNA binding domain of recombinant yeast TBP was provided by Dr. S. M. Cohen in our laboratory and prepared as described previously (24Cohen S.M. Jamieson E.J. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8259-8265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The concentration of active TBP was determined as reported in the literature (34Hahn S. Buratowski S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Table I lists the 25-bp oligonucleotides used in this study together with their abbreviations. The synthesis, platination, and purification of site-specifically platinated single-stranded oligonucleotides were carried out as described previously (26Dunham S.U. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11428-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Platinated top strands, (5′-CCTCTCCTCTCN1G*G*N2 TCTTCTCTCC-3′, N1 and N2 = A, T, or C), where the asterisks indicate the formation of Pt-N(7) bonds, were annealed with their complementary bottom strands in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2, heated to 90 °C, and slowly cooled to 4 °C over several hours. The resulting cisplatin-modified duplex probes were purified by ion-ex- change HPLC using a Dionex DNApac PA-100 column. These oligonucleotides were desalted by dialysis and concentrated to 5–10 μm. The TATAMLP probe (Table I) was prepared by the same method except for the platination step. The TATA element of adenovirus major late promoter, one of the strongest promoters, was used for this study. The purity of the platinated single-stranded DNA was confirmed by analytical HPLC. Atomic absorption spectroscopy combined with UV-visible spectroscopy and electrospray mass spectrometry verified the existence of singly platinated probes (see the supplemental material on-line).Table IDuplex DNA probes and abbreviationsAbbreviationProbes1-aBoldface font denotes the TATA box, cisplatin d(GpG) lesion (N1GGN2), and flanking sequences.TATAMLP5′-AAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGG-3′3′-TTCCCCCCGATATTTTCCCCCACCC-5′AGGA5′-CCTCTCCTCTCAGGATCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGTCCTAGAAGAGAGG-5′AGGT5′-CCTCTCCTCTCAGGTTCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGTCCAAGAAGAGAGG-5′AGGC5′-CCTCTCCTCTCAGGCTCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGTCCGAGAAGAGAGG-5′TGGA5′-CCTCTCCTCTCTGGATCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGACCTAGAAGAGAGG-5′TGGT5′-CCTCTCCTCTCTGGTTCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGACCAAGAAGAGAGG-5′TGGC5′-CCTCTCCTCTCTGGCTCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGACCGAGAAGAGAGG-5′CGGA5′-CCTCTCCTCTCCGGATCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGGCCTAGAAGAGAGG-5′CGGT5′-CCTCTCCTCTCCGGTTCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGGCCAAGAAGAGAGG-5′CGGC5′-CCTCTCCTCTCCGGCTCTTCTCTCC-3′3′-GGAGAGGAGAGGCCGAGAAGAGAGG-5′1-a Boldface font denotes the TATA box, cisplatin d(GpG) lesion (N1GGN2), and flanking sequences. Open table in a new tab All platinated and TATAMLP duplex probes (∼10 pmol) were radioactively labeled at their 5′-ends by using 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 20 units of polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Labeled probes were separated from small nucleotides by passage through G-25 Sephadex Quickspin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For each binding reaction, DNA probes (0.5–2 nm, ∼10,000 cpm) and the indicated concentrations of TBP were mixed and incubated in a buffer solution containing 60 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 5.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol (24Cohen S.M. Jamieson E.J. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8259-8265Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, binding mixtures were directly loaded onto 6% native polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 150 V in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 190 mm glycine, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 4.0 mmMgCl2 running buffer. The gels were dried at 80 °C and then exposed to phosphorimaging plates for 15–20 h. Quantitative analysis was performed with a Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager employing Multi-analyst software (Bio-Rad). For the measurement of the protein-DNA association constants by kinetic methods, the increase in the amount of complex was monitored at various times after the addition of 5–10 nm TBP to ∼1 nm probe. As described previously (35Parvin J.D. McCormick R.J. Sharp P.A. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1995; 373: 724-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the raw data were fit to Equation 1, 1/[TBP]0ln([probe]0/{[probe]0−[complex]})=kontEq. 1 which is derived from the bimolecular binding equation under conditions of excess protein (36Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn M. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The left side of the equation was plotted against time in s, and the kon value for each probe was obtained from the slope of the plot. In the equation, [TBP]0 and [probe]0 indicate the initial concentrations of TBP and DNA probe, respectively, and [complex] is the concentration of complex at each time point. To determine the dissociation rate constants (koff), ∼10 nm TBP and ∼1 nm probe were mixed at 30 °C for 30 min to reach the equilibrium state. Dissociation of the protein-DNA complexes was initiated by the addition of 200 ng of poly[dI·dC] at different time points to assure that all dissociation reactions were complete at the same time. The decrease in the amount of complex was followed over a 1- or 2-h time period. The data were fit to Equation 2 to obtain the first-order rate constant for the dissociation reaction,ln{[complex]/[complex]0}=−kofftEq. 2 where [complex] indicates the concentration of complex at time t, and [complex]0 is the complex concentration under the initial binding conditions. The natural logarithm of [complex] divided by [complex]0 was plotted versus time, and the negative slope of the fit provided the koff value. The dissociation constant,Kd, values were calculated from these results (Kd=kon/koff). Competitor DNA of varying concentrations was mixed with a fixed amount of TBP and radioactively labeled TATAMLP, and the disappearance of the TBP-TATAMLP complex was analyzed by EMSA. Competition assays were also used to obtain the Kdvalues for weak binding probes. In such a competition experiment, two binding reactions proceed simultaneously and follow the relationship in Equation 3 (37Lin S.Y. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar),θ=Pt(1−θ)Kt(1+Ct)/Kc+Tt(1−θ)Eq. 3 where Pt, Ct, and Tt represent the total concentrations of TBP, competitor, and TATAMLP, respectively. Kt and Kc are the respective dissociation constants of TATAMLP and competitor. At different Ct values, the binding fraction (θ) was determined. The Kd value can be calculated by using Equation 4, where C1/2 represents the concentration of competitor at θ = 1/2 (37Lin S.Y. Riggs A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 671-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).Kc=2KtC1/22Pt−Tt−2KtEq. 4 Whole cell-free extracts (CFE) from HeLa cells were prepared by a reported method (38Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. DNA duplexes 161 bp in length containing a site-specific cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) or 1,3-d(GpTpG) cross-link with a radiolabeled phosphate located six or seven bases to the 5′ side of the cisplatin binding site were prepared as previously described (39Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 40Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The probes contained three phosphorothioate residues at their 3′ ends to minimize nonspecific nuclease degradation. Whole cell extracts were incubated with damaged DNA in excision repair buffer (39Zamble D.B. Mu D. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10004-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), and excision fragments were resolved by 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the repair experiment in the presence of TBP, the protein was pre-incubated with the damaged DNA probe in excision repair buffer for 30 min on ice unless otherwise indicated. The extent of NER was measured by comparing the signal intensity corresponding to the 25–30-bp excised fragment with that of the entire lane. The small amount of DNA degradation due to nonspecific nuclease activity was subtracted from the repair signal by using the area corresponding to the 32–37-bp region as background (41Branum M.E. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25421-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To optimize conditions for the EMSA experiments, probes of three different lengths (15, 25, and 35 bp) were investigated. The 15-bp probe showed weak binding affinity to TBP compared with longer probes. In addition, this short oligonucleotide was partially melted under the experimental conditions (data not shown). The 35-bp probe displayed a considerable level of nonspecific binding (data not shown). The 25-bp probe was stable under the experimental conditions and did not exhibit any nonspecific binding. Therefore, 25-bp probes were used for further studies. EMSA analyses were performed to investigate the kinetics of TBP binding to the TATA box (TATAMLP) and cisplatin-damaged DNA (AGGA, TableI). Fig.1 A shows EMSA data used to determine the association rate constants for two probes, and the data analysis is presented in Fig. 1 B. The bimolecular binding reactions reach the equilibrium state within 10 min for both probes. As shown in Fig. 1 A, however, the TBP-AGGA complex clearly forms more rapidly than the TBP-TATAMLP complex. Data collected within 2–3 min were fit to Equation 1, yielding konvalues of 1.3 × 105m−1s−1 for TBP binding to TATAMLP and 3.0 × 105m−1 s−1 for the AGGA probe (Fig. 1 B). The kon value for TATAMLP is in good agreement with published values, which fall in the range 1.0–3.0 × 105m−1s−1 (21Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Parvin J.D. McCormick R.J. Sharp P.A. Fisher D.E.

After the addition of excess of poly[dI·dC] to the TBP-DNA complex, decreased amounts of the complex were detected (Fig.2). The dissociation reaction data were fit to Equation 2. The AGGA and TATAMLP probes dissociate from TBP with half-lives, t12, of 120 min and 190 min, respectively. Although TBP associates with AGGA more rapidly than with TATAMLP, the latter probe has a slightly lower off-rate (Table II).Table IIKinetic and thermodynamic parameters for TBP binding to each probeProbekonkoffKdm−1s−1s−1nmTATAMLP1.3 ± 0.2 × 1050.57 ± 0.05 × 10−40.44AGGA3.0 ± 0.5 × 1050.89 ± 0.09 × 10−40.30AGGT2.1 ± 0.2 × 1050.96 ± 0.04 × 10−40.46AGGC2.3 ± 0.1 × 1051.1 ± 0.1 × 10−40.48TGGA1.6 ± 0.2 × 1054.5 ± 0.0 × 10−42.8TGGT1.5 ± 0.1 × 1053.0 ± 0.1 × 10−42.0TGGC12 ± 1.02-aMeasured by competition assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).CGGA1.3 ± 0.1 × 1052.6 ± 0.2 × 10−42.0CGGT1.2 ± 0.2 × 1052.2 ± 0.3 × 10−41.9CGGC10 ± 1.02-aMeasured by competition assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).Values indicate the average and 1 S.D. of at least three experiments.2-a Measured by competition assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab Values indicate the average and 1 S.D. of at least three experiments. From these kon and koffresults, dissociation constants Kd(koff/kon) for each probe were calculated (Table II). Comparison of Kd values for AGGA and TATAMLP reveals that cisplatin-damaged DNA has about a 1.5-fold higher binding affinity to TBP compared with that of its natural binding site, the TATA box, under the same binding conditions. The Kd value (0.44 nm) for the TATA box binding to adenovirus major late promoter is consistent with previous reports (21Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol.

Previously we demonstrated that HMG domains display a distinct selectivity for platinated DNA containing different flanking sequences (26Dunham S.U. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11428-11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Cohen S.M. Mikata Y. He Q. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11771-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, different flanking sequences can affect the conformational and thermodynamic properties of cisplatin-damaged oligonucleotides (47Pilch D.S. Dunham S.U. Jamieson E.R. Lippard S.J. Breslauer K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the kinetics of TBP binding to cisplatin-damaged probes in diverse sequence contexts (Table I). Fig.3 shows EMSAs of TBP binding to TATAMLP and nine different cisplatin-damaged probes. Sequence selectivity is clearly manifest for TBP binding to platinated DNA. Kinetic EMSA experiments were performed to determine kon and koff values for each probe. Fig. 4 A indicates fits to EMSA data obtained from the association kinetics for six different cisplatin-damaged probes. All konvalues lie between 2.1 × 105m−1 s−1 and 1.2 × 105m−1 s−1, indicating that most of the cisplatin-damaged DNA complexes have faster association rates than that of the TATA box (Table II). The koff values were also calculated by fitting the dissociation EMSA data to Equation 2 (Fig. 4 B). The two more weakly binding probes, TGGC and CGGC, did not allow reliable kinetic data to be obtained. We therefore carried out competition assays to obtain relative Kd values for these two probes. At various concentrations of TGGC or CGGC competitor, the binding fraction of the TBP to TATAMLP was examined by EMSA and quantitated (Fig.5). From the curve fitting shown in Fig.5 B, the concentration of competitor at θ = 1/2,C1/2, was calculated. Equation 4 was employed to compute Kd values of 12 and 10 nm, respectively, for TGGC and CGGC as competitors.Figure 5Competition EMSA assay between TGGC and TATAMLP.

At the N1 position, TBP prefers dA rather than T or dC, and TBP forms more stable complexes when N2 is either dA or T. A DNase I footprinting assay previously demonstrated reduced binding of TBP to the TATA box after the addition of excess cisplatin-damaged DNA (48Coin F. Frit P. Viollet B. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3907-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, competition EMSA experiments were performed to study the relative binding affinities of TBP to the TATA box and cisplatin-damaged DNA. TBP and the two DNA probes were mixed, and the amounts of free and bound TATA box were analyzed by using radioactively labeled TATA box DNA. Fig. 6 provides clear evidence that TBP dissociates from the TATA box upon addition of cisplatin-damaged DNA. At 1 nm TBP, more than half of the TBP-TATAMLP complex has dissociated when equivalent amounts (4 nm) of AGGA and TATAMLP are present. Upon the addition of a 3-fold excess of AGGA, most of the TBP is sequestered from the natural TATAMLP binding site. Cisplatin-modified DNA is repaired by the NER machinery. When HMG-domain proteins are added to HeLa cell-free extracts or reconstituted NER components, a significant amount of the repair of cisplatin 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-links is inhibited (39Zamble D.B"

Cation-coupled Cl− cotransporters, anion exchangers, and anion channels play critical roles in moving Cl− across cell and organelle membranes in all organisms. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated the existence of numerous types of anion channels in bacteria (1Maduke M. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. J. Gen.

However, despite this diversity and the multiple and important physiological roles played by anion channels, relatively little is known about their molecular structure and regulation. To date, only four structurally distinct classes of anion-selective channels have been defined unequivocally. These classes include ligand-gated anion channels (10Jackson M.B. Adv.

Biomembr. 1997; 29: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Certain porins and bacterial toxins have also been shown to form anion-selective channels (e.g. Ref. 13Tombola F. Del G.G. Papini E. Zoratti M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 863-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Perhaps one of the least understood classes of Cl−channels is the outward rectifiers or ORCCs.1 Substantial effort has been focused on characterizing an ORCC expressed in airway epithelia. The molecular identity of this channel is unknown, but it plays an important role in airway Cl− and fluid secretion and appears to be regulated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (6Kunzelmann K. Schreiber R. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol.

Calcium-activated ORCCs have been described in numerous cell types and may play essential roles in a variety of fundamental physiological processes (8Frings S. Reuter D. Kleene S.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9Morris A.P. Adv. Pharmacol. 1999; 46: 209-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CLCA genes have been proposed to encode these channels (15Pauli B.U. Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H.C. Gruber A.D. Archibald H.A. Elble R.C. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2000; 27: 901-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but this remains controversial. Virtually all mammalian cells studied to date express a swelling-activated outwardly rectifying anion channel that is thought to play important roles in cell volume homeostasis (4Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein and pICln have both been suggested to function as swelling-activated ORCCs. However, most workers in the field no longer consider these proteins to be viable channel candidates (16Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Strange K. J.

J. 1998; 331: 347-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the swelling-activated ORCC was proposed to be due to the activity of ClC-3, a member of the ClC superfamily of voltage-gated anion channels (19Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The findings on ClC-3 have not yet been reproduced by other laboratories, and a variety of recent observations including studies on ClC-3 knockout mice have begun to raise doubts about a widespread role for this channel in volume-sensitive anion channel function (20Li X.

The nematode C. elegans offers substantial experimental advantages for defining the molecular structure, physiological roles, and regulation of ion channels. These advantages include a fully sequenced genome, a short life cycle, and the ability to carry out powerful genetic analyses of physiological processes. In addition, gene function in C. elegans can be readily manipulated by the generation of knockout and transgenic animals and by the use of RNA interference to disrupt targeted gene expression. While genetic and molecular biological studies can provide unique and powerful insights into the physiology and regulation of ion channels, direct measurement of ion channel activity in C. elegansusing patch clamp techniques is difficult due to the relative inaccessibility and small size of somatic cells in adult animals. In contrast, C. elegans oocytes and early embryo cells are large and can be isolated with relative ease. We describe here the electrophysiological characterization of an outwardly rectifying voltage- and mechanosensitive anion current,ICl,mec. ICl,mec is activated shortly after oocyte fertilization and is expressed abundantly in early embryos, and its activity is reduced significantly in terminally differentiated cell types, suggesting that it may play important roles in embryogenesis and/or cytokinesis. All strains were derived from the wild type N2 line and maintained at 20–25 °C utilizing standard methods (25Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains used in these studies weregcy-5::GFP DA1262 (adEx1262) (26Yu S. Avery L. Baude E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3384-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar),mec-4::GFP (zdIs4), andmec-7::GFP CF702. All GFP strains contain integrated transgenes with the exception of thegcy-5::GFP line, which carries an extrachromosomal array. Embryonic cells were prepared by treating adult nematodes with an alkaline hypochlorite solution (0.5 mNaOH and 1% NaOCl) for 5 min (27Lewis J.A. Fleming J.T. Epstein H.F. Shakes D.C. Caenorhabditis elegans: Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. Academic Press, Inc., New York1995: 4-29Google Scholar). Eggs released by this treatment were pelleted by centrifugation and then washed three times with egg buffer containing 118 mm NaCl, 48 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.3, 340 mOsm) (28Edgar L.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 303-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Adult carcasses were separated from washed eggs by density centrifugation in 30% sucrose. The egg layer was removed by pipette and washed one time with egg buffer and then pelleted. Eggshells were removed by resuspending pelleted eggs in egg buffer containing 1–2.5 units/ml of chitinase (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. After digestion of the eggshell, the suspension was passed through a 23-gauge needle, and cells were washed twice with L-15 cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and adjusted to 340 mOsm with sucrose (L-15-10). Washed cells were re-suspended in L-15 medium and kept on ice until use. To isolate intact embryos at defined stages of development, eggs were prepared in bulk as described above and kept in ice-cold egg buffer. Small aliquots of the isolated eggs were transferred into a drop of egg buffer with chitinase in the patch clamp bath chamber. After eggshell digestion, the bath chamber was filled with patch clamp bath solution. Oocytes were isolated by cutting individual nematodes behind the pharyngeal bulb using a 26-gauge needle. The extruded gonad was then detached by making another cut in front of the spermatheca. Gonads were transferred to a small drop of egg buffer in the patch clamp bath chamber and allowed to spontaneously eject oocytes. Once an oocyte was ejected, the gonad was washed away by filling the chamber with patch clamp bath solution. Embryo cells were isolated as described above and then filtered through a sterile 5-μm Durapore syringe filter (Millipore Corp., Bedford MA) to remove undissociated embryos and newly hatched larvae. Filtered cells were plated on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips coated with 1 mg/ml peanut lectin agglutinin (57Buechner M. Hall D.H. Bhatt H. Hedgecock E.M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained at 24 °C in a humidified incubator in L-15 tissue culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The osmolality of the culture medium was adjusted to 345 mOsm by the addition of sucrose. Embryo cells and oocytes were allowed to attach to the poly-l-lysine-coated coverslip bottom of a bath chamber (model R-26G; Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) that was mounted onto the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. Cells were visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy using a Zeiss Neofluar × 63 (1.25 numerical aperture) oil immersion objective lens and a Leitz × 32 (0.4 numerical aperture) condenser lens. Patch electrodes were pulled from 1.5-mm outer diameter borosilicate glass microhematocrit tubes (Fisher) or soft glass capillary tubes (PG10165-4, World PI, Sarasota, FL) that had been silanized with dimethyl-dichloro silane (Sigma). The standard bath and pipette solutions for membrane patch recordings from embryo cells and oocytes contained 120–150 mm NaCl, CsCl, or NMDG-Cl and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3. In the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+, a large conductance Cl− channel was active in isolated membrane patches from embryos. This channel activity interfered with the measurement of ICl,mec, and divalent cations were therefore omitted from bath and pipette solutions. Osmolality was adjusted to 330–340 mOsm with sucrose. Whole cell recordings on cultured mechanosensory neurons were performed using solutions described by Lockery and co-workers (29Lockery S.R. Goodman M.B. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Goodman M.B. Hall D.H. Avery L. Lockery S.R.

Nature. 2001; 410: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Neuron pipette and bath solutions contained 125 mm potassium gluconate, 18 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.6 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 42 mm sucrose (pH 7.2, 325 mOsm) and 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 20 mmd-glucose, 25 mm sucrose (pH 7.2, 345 mOsm), respectively. Membrane patch and whole-cell currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) patch clamp amplifier. Command voltage generation, data digitization, and data analysis were carried out on a 200-MHz Pentium computer (Dimension XPS M200s; Dell Computer Corp.) using a Digidata 1200 AD/DA interface with pClamp 6 and Clampfit 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered at 1 kHz using an eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices Inc., Haverhill, MA) and digitized at 10 kHz. Whole-cell current measurements from mechanosensory neurons were filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz. Electrical connections to the amplifier were made using Ag/AgCl wires and 3 m KCl/agar bridges. Voltages are reported as membrane potentials. A pneumatic pressure transducer/tester (model DPM-1B; Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) was used for applying step changes in pipette pressure. Ion substitution studies on membrane patches were performed by complete replacement of bath NaCl with NaSCN, NaI, NaBr, or NaF. For all ion substitution experiments, changes in liquid junction potentials were measured directly using a free flowing electrode. Reversal potentials were corrected for these changes. Changes in single channel activity were estimated by calculatingNPo, which is the product of the total number of channels in the patch and channel open probability. Single channel current levels for individual membrane patches were plotted as an all points histogram. Open and closed current levels were fitted by single Gaussian distributions. NPo was calculated as Σxi, where i = 1 + n,n is the maximum number of open channels, and xis the area under the curve of the Gaussian fit for each channel opening. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's two-tailed t test for paired or unpaired means. pvalues of ≤0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. Dissociated embryo cell preparations primarily contained single cells and multicellular clusters of 2 to ∼20 cells. Based on measurements of cell diameters, we estimate that most of the isolated cells and small cell clusters are derived from 2 to ∼100 cell stage embryos. We operationally define these as “early” embryos. Intact embryos at the “comma” and later stages, operationally defined as “late” embryos, are also present in the preparation. Patch clamp measurements described here were performed on dissociated “early” embryo cells. Isolated embryo cells were viable and continued to divide for several hours after dissociation. In early studies, we noted that application of gentle suction to the patch pipette during gigaohm seal formation frequently activated a strongly outwardly rectifying current. An outwardly rectifying current was also occasionally activated during excision of membrane patches. Activation of outward current was observed consistently when negative pressure was applied to inside-out membrane patches (Fig.1, A and B). Current activation and inactivation were rapid with application or removal of negative pressure, respectively (Fig. 1 C). Pressure-induced current activation was a graded and saturable function of applied pressure (Fig. 1 D). Currents that were constitutively activated after patch excision were usually activated further by membrane stretch. Mean current at +100 mV in inside-out patches with constitutively active channels increased 4.7 ± 1.7-fold (range = 1.1–28.3-fold; n = 16) with application of −30 to −40 mm Hg pressure. The outward current was voltage-sensitive and activated further by strong depolarization (Fig. 1 A). At +100 mV, current activation was well fit by a double exponential describing fast (τf) and slow (τs) time constants. Mean ± S.E. τf and τs were 201 ± 16 and 1919 ± 327 ms (n = 18), respectively. To assess the ionic selectivity of the outward current, changes inErev were measured following changes in bath NaCl concentration. Reduction of bath NaCl from 150 to 75 mm hyperpolarized Erev by −10 ± 1.6 mV (n = 6). Elevation of bath NaCl to 300 mm depolarized Erev by +9.3 ± 0.4 mV (n = 8). The direction of the shift inErev indicates that the channels responsible for the current are predominately anion-selective. Using the GHK equation, the calculated relative Na+ permeability of the channels (i.e. PNa/PCl) is 0.26–0.29. The relative cation permeability is similar to that described for several other anion channels (32Franciolini F. Nonner W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 453-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 33Jackson P.S. Churchwell K. Ballatori N. Boyer J.L. Strange K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C57-C66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hereafter refer to this mechanosensitive anion current asICl,mec. The anion selectivity of the ICl,mec channel was assessed by measurement of changes in Erevfollowing complete replacement of bath Cl− with various test anions. Changes in Erev and the relative permeability to various anions (i.e. PX/PCl) calculated using the GHK equation are shown in Table I. The observed anion selectivity sequence of theICl,mec channel follows an Eisenman type I selectivity series with SCN− > I− > Br− ∼ Cl− > F−.Table IEffects of anion substitutions on ICl,mec ErevAnionΔErevPX/PClmVSCN−20.4 ± 4.4 (n = 5)2.2 ± 0.4I−13.1 ± 1.3 (n = 8)1.7 ± 0.1Br−3.7 ± 1.0 (n = 7)1.2 ± 0.05F−−8.8 ± 1.3 (n = 5)0.7 ± 0.03Values are means ± S.E.

Data were obtained from inside-out patches bathed bilaterally with 150 mm NaCl. Relative anion permeability (PX /PCl ) was calculated using the GHK equation, and measured changes in reversal potential (ΔErev) were induced by complete replacement of bath Cl− with Na+ salts of the various test anions. Reversal potential measurements were corrected for changes in liquid junction potentials. The inhibitor sensitivity of ICl,mec was assessed using outside-out patches. Currents were activated by positive pipette pressure. Mean current at +100 mV in outside-out patches increased 41.8 ± 25.7-fold (range = 2.8–45.2-fold;n = 7) with application of +15 to +30 mm Hg pressure. At +60 mV, ICl,mec was inhibited 40 ± 8% (n = 3) by 50 μm5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid, 54 ± 8% (n = 5) by 500 μm DIDS, and 95 ± 4% (n = 3) by 100 μm Gd3+. Inhibition by all three agents was rapid (<1–5 s) and at least partially reversible (data not shown). Macroscopic currents shown in Fig. 1 were measured using patch pipettes with a resistance of 1.5–3 MΩ. To measure single channel activity, it was necessary to pull smaller inside-out patches using higher resistance (5–12-MΩ) pipettes. We observed only a single channel type when patches were pulled with high resistance pipettes and bathed bilaterally with 125–150 mm NMDG-Cl or NaCl solutions. This channel had a unitary conductance of 5–7 picosiemens at holding potentials of ±100 mV when activated using −5 to −30 mm Hg pressure (Fig. 2). An identical channel type was detected in cell-attached patches (data not shown). Membrane patches containing a single channel were extremely rare; most patches had at least two or three active channels. Single channels were either inactive or constitutively active after formation of gigaohm seals and/or patch excision. Inactive channels were activated by application of negative pressure (Fig.2 A). Constitutively active channels were activated further by suction. The mean NPo at +100 mV of constitutively active channels increased 7.7 ± 3.9-fold (range = 2.1–19.5-fold; n = 4) in inside-out patches and 3.9 ± 0.9-fold (range = 2.7–6;n = 4) in cell-attached patches with application of negative pressures of −5 to −30 mm Hg. The I-V relationship for single channel currents was linear with a slope conductance of 6.8 ± 0.1 picosiemens (Fig.2 B). Single channel activity was voltage-sensitive, andNPo was a nonlinear function of voltage (Fig. 2,C and D). At voltages between −100 mV and −60 mV, NPo was relatively voltage-insensitive. Membrane depolarization increasedNPo significantly (Fig. 2 D). MeanNPo at −100 mV was 0.10 ± 0.03 and 0.16 ± 0.03 and increased to 0.45 ± 0.05 (n= 7; p < 0.002) and 0.37 ± 0.1 (n = 7; p < 0.02) at +100 mV in cell-attached and inside-out patches, respectively. We suggest that the mechanosensitive single channel activity shown in Fig. 2 gives rise to macroscopic ICl,mec. The nonlinear relationship between single channelNPo and voltage is consistent with the outwardly rectifying I-V relationship of the steady-state macroscopic current (compare Figs. 1 B and 2 D). Outward rectification of ICl,mec is most likely due to depolarization-induced increases in channel open probability rather than a change in channel conductance. TheICl,mec channel was expressed abundantly in “early” embryo cells. Channel activity was typically observed in >80% of the membrane patches pulled from a given cell preparation. The density of channels in cell-attached and cell-detached patches is particularly noteworthy. Macroscopic anion currents of 40–120 pA at +100 mV were commonly observed when using 1.5–3 MΩ patch pipettes (e.g. Figs. 1, A and B). Based on our estimates of ICl,mec unitary current, a membrane patch exhibiting 100 pA of outward anion current at +100 mV should contain at least 140 active channels. ICl,mec appeared to be expressed ubiquitously rather than confined to a particular cell type or stage of “early” development. As a fertilized C. elegans egg divides, individual cells become progressively smaller. Thus, cell diameter reflects the stage of embryonic development. In order to assess the early developmental expression pattern ofICl,mec, the diameters of patch clamped cells were measured. Fig. 3 shows the frequency at which ICl,mec was detected in inside-out membrane patches pulled from cells at various stages of development. These data demonstrate that the channel is expressed in 2–4-cell stage embryos (>20-μm diameter) and embryos up to at least the ∼100-cell stage (5–7-μm diameter). To definitively assess the earliest stage of embryonic development at which ICl,mec could be detected, embryos were manually dissected from single worms. Intact embryos were patch clamped after removal of the eggshell. ICl,mec was observed in two patches pulled from two single cell embryos. The current was also observed in a total of 10 patches pulled from intact 2–16 cell stage embryos (Table II).

Twenty-nine cell-attached and inside-out patches recordings were made on 29 oocytes. Stretch-activated anion currents were not detected in any of these patches. Oocyte whole-cell recordings carried out in previous studies have also failed to reveal the presence of outwardly rectifying anion currents resemblingICl,mec (34Rutledge E. Bianchi L. Christensen M.

The absence of outwardly rectifying anion currents in oocytes suggests thatICl,mec is activated shortly after fertilization. Cells of early embryos exhibit little or no obvious morphological differentiation. To determine whetherICl,mec is expressed in terminally differentiated cell types, we cultured dissociated embryonic cells on glass coverslips. Embryonic cells differentiate into the major cell types that comprise the newly hatched L1 larva when plated onto substrates coated with agents such as peanut lectin that promote cell adhesion. 2M.

https://openalex.org/W2004601721,"The effect of nitric oxide on p11 expression was studied in an immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B cells). Three nitric oxide donors were used: spermine NONOate (SP), (±)-S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and S-nitrosoglutathione (SNOG). All three nitric oxide donors had similar effects resulting in dose-dependent and time-dependent accumulation of p11 protein and an increase of steady-state p11 mRNA. Studies using a reporter gene containing the region from −1499 to +89 of the p11 promoter demonstrated an increase in transcriptional activity after stimulation with NO donors for 4 h. These effects were abolished at the promoter and protein level using protein kinase G inhibitors (KT5823 andRp-8-pCPT-cGMPS). Incubation of transfected cells with a cell permeable cGMP analogue (8-Br-cGMP) resulted in a dose-related increase of promoter activity. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay of nuclear proteins extracted from BEAS-2B cells identified an AP-1 site located at −82 to −77 of the p11 promoter region as an NO- and cGMP- dependent response element. These data were confirmed using a c-jun dominant negative mutant vector and a c-jun expression plasmid. Therefore, we conclude that nitric oxide-induced p11 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells is mediated at least in part through increased binding of activator protein one to the p11 promoter.

(1Moore K.G. Goulet F. Sartorelli A.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) who initially characterized a group of low molecular weight (10,000–12,000) acidic proteins in neural tissue. The S-100 group consists of calcium-binding proteins that are expressed in a cell type-dependent fashion. There are at least 13 members, including S-100a, S-100b, and p11 (calpactin light chain). While p11 is a member of the S-100 family, it does not have the ability to bind Ca+2 ions due to crucial amino acid deletions and substitutions in the two EF-hand loops of the protein (2Gerke V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1106-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). p11 binds to and inhibits the phosphorylation of annexin II, and binds to the carboxyl region and inhibits cytosolic phospholipase A2activity (3Wu T.

Snyder S.H. Cell. 1992; 70: 705-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Moreover, nitric oxide also plays a role as a messenger in a number of diseases including septic shock, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis (5Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The main source of NO in humans is nitric oxide synthase (present in at least three isoforms), which catalyzes the oxidation ofl-arginine to l-citrulline and NO (6Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide influences the expression of many genes including cyclooxygenase-2 (7von Knethen A. Brune B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (8Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M.

This activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase I and II (G-kinase, PKG) (11Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar) causing phosphorylation of target proteins or transcription factors. In addition, NO influences transcription via a cGMP-independent mechanism by decreasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP and affecting cAMP response elements (12Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) thereby influencing the transcription of various genes.As the influence of nitric oxide on expression and activity of several enzymes located in downstream pathways involving arachidonic acid metabolism (such as cyclooxygenase-2) is well known, it was of interest to determine the effect of nitric oxide on p11 expression. Our aim was to study the influence of NO on p11 transcription, steady-state levels of p11 mRNA, and protein concentration in human epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONp11, or calpactin light chain, is a member of the S-100 family of small, calcium-binding proteins; however, it has several unique features. S-100 proteins contain two EF-hands that function as calcium-binding domains (2Gerke V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1106-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). p11 does not have the ability to bind Ca2+ ions due to amino acid deletions and substitutions in the two EF-hand motifs. Instead, p11 is present in a variety of cells separately or as a heterotetramer with annexin II (p36). The heterotetramer is composed of two copies of the 36-kDa heavy chain, annexin II, subunits and two copies of 11-kDa light chain (p11) subunits as (p36)2(p11)2 (2Gerke V. Biochem. Soc.

Annexin I has been reported to inhibit phospholipase A2 activity in vitro. These observations led to the hypothesis that the inhibition of phospholipase A2 by annexins is the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids. Yao and colleagues (15Yao X.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17202-17208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have shown that glucocorticosteroids increased p11 levels in BEAS-2B and HeLa cells and inhibited phospholipase A2activity and arachidonic acid release. These studies taken together suggest a potential role for p11 in regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism in epithelial cells. The (p36)2(p11)2 complex may play an important role in exocytosis allowing cross-linking between vesicle and cellular membranes (16Konig J. Prenen J. Nilius B. Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19679-19684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since annexin II is a substrate for srckinase and PKC, its role in regulation of cell growth and differentiation has been postulated (17Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of annexin II heavy chain reduces the affinity for p11 binding and on the other hand, p11 binding to p36 interferes with the phosphorylation of p36. Therefore, it may influence several signal transduction pathways (including insulin receptor sorting and internalization) (18Biener Y. Feinstein R. Mayak M. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29489-29496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies in Nb2 (T lymphoma) cells suggested that an increase in p11 level may decrease cell proliferation (19Gerke V. Heizmann C.W. p11, A Member of the S-100 Protein Family, Is Associated with the Tyrosine Kinase Substrate p36 (Annexin II). Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 139-155Google Scholar). (p36)2(p11)2complex may also increase c-raf-1 kinase activity (20Matsumoto T. Murao S. Kito K. Kihana T. Matsuura S. Ueda N. Pathol. Int. 1997; 47: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Annexin II-p11 tetramer may also act as a surface protein receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator. Extracellular p11 binds to plasminogen and increases plasmin generation (21Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Nitric oxide is a potent transcriptional regulator influencing a variety of genes including genes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism. Modulation of promoter activity by NO has been reported to occur by either cGMP-dependent or -independent mechanisms and can result in either up-regulation or down-regulation of gene transcription (7von Knethen A. Brune B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J.

Many promoter studies were done using relatively long promoter regions that appear to be involved in NO-mediated responses. Some studies also concentrated on identification of transcription factors involved in NO-dependent promoter regulation. These studies have identified the following nitric oxide response elements: NF-κB (22Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar), AP-1 (23Tabuchi A. Oh E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), heat shock factor 1 (24Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and SP-1 (12Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), all of which undergo increased or decreased DNA binding upon exposure of cells or cell extract to exogenous NO. Redox-sensitive transcription factors (such as SP-1) bind to DNA via three zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 (24Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and zinc is easily displaced by a redox reaction or thiol compounds (25Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Some data also suggest that nitric oxide decreased transcription factor binding (NF-κB and c-jun) by S-nitrosylation (26delaTorre A. Schroeder R.A. Bartlett S.T. Kuo P.C. Surgery. 1998; 124: 137-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies taken together also suggest that nitric oxide may act through a variety of nuclear proteins and that the final effect is promoter-specific.In this study, we show that p11 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells is stimulated by nitric oxide and that this process is mediated by cGMP activation and the binding of AP-1 complex to an AP-1-binding site located at −82 to −77 of p11 promoter. This effect was confirmed using three different nitric oxide donors (SP, SNAP, and SNOG) in a relatively broad range of concentrations from 10 to 500 μm. SNAP and SNOG are able to enhance nuclear protein binding by S-nitrosylation, whereas SP is unable to mediate this process. A similar effect of all three nitric oxide donors suggests that p11 accumulation is not mediated throughS-nitrosylation. These effects appeared to be time- and dose-dependent.To confirm that this effect is mediated at the transcriptional level, we assayed steady state mRNA levels showing that p11 mRNA levels are increased in response to NO donors in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A p11 reporter gene containing 188 base pairs 5′ of the transcription start site responded to NO donors. Incubation of epithelial cells with nitric oxide donors also significantly increased nuclear protein binding to the AP-1-binding site in the p11 promoter. This effect was blocked when cells were preincubated with a PKG inhibitor and was mimicked by a cell permeable cGMP analogue. To reconfirm this finding we mutated the AP-1 site in a −188+89 reporter construct and this reporter gene did not respond to an NO donor. Similarly, the p11 reporter gene did not respond to SP in cells co-transfected with an AP-1 dominant negative plasmid.Nitric oxide may modulate activator protein-1 binding activity byS-nitrosylation. This has been reported to decrease the AP-1 complex binding to DNA (23Tabuchi A. Oh E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein kinase G is able to mediate phosphorylation of various transcription factors including activator protein-1 complex proteins. This effect significantly increased binding to DNA (27Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that KT 5823 and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, PKG inhibitors, were found to decrease AP-1 complex binding activity and abolished the NO effect on the expression of p11 protein and p11 promoter activity we conclude that the p11 promoter is activated through AP-1 complex phosphorylation leading to increased binding. We confirmed the fact that protein kinase G is playing a crucial role in nitric oxide-induced p11 accumulation using a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (ODQ) and a cell permeable cGMP analogue. ODQ preincubation completely inhibited the NO effect on p11 promoter activity in transfected BEAS-2B cells suggesting guanylate cyclase involvement. The fact that a cGMP analogue is able to mimic the NO effect on p11 promoter activity and protein expression further confirms this hypothesis.Recently the fos gene was reported to be regulated via soluble guanylate cyclase and type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase although a putative NO/cGMP responsive promoter element was not described for this gene (28Idriss S.D. Gudi T. Casteel D.E. Kharitonov V.G. Pilz R.B. Boss G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9489-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An NO/cGMP/PKG/AP-1 pathway was confirmed for the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter (29Gertzberg N. Clements R. Jaspers I. Ferro T.J. Neumann P. Flescher E. Johnson A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in pulmonary endothelial cells. Similarly, nitric oxide stimulates transforming growth factor β-1 release from human alveolar epithelial cells through protein kinase G activation (30Bellocq A. Azoulay E. Marullo S. Flahault A. Fouqueray B. Philippe C. Cadranel J. Baud L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), although the transcription factor involved in this process was not postulated. These data suggest the importance of NO-dependent phosphorylation of activator protein one complex in promoter activation in human lung cells.While p11 has been reported to play a variety of roles in cellular function (17Johnstone S.A.

Matsuura S. Ueda N. Pathol. Int. 1997; 47: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We believe that nitric oxide activation of AP-1 binding in the p11 promoter is one of the mechanisms by which this effect may occur.

These studies taken together suggest a potential role for p11 in regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism in epithelial cells. The (p36)2(p11)2 complex may play an important role in exocytosis allowing cross-linking between vesicle and cellular membranes (16Konig J. Prenen J. Nilius B. Gerke V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19679-19684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Since annexin II is a substrate for srckinase and PKC, its role in regulation of cell growth and differentiation has been postulated (17Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of annexin II heavy chain reduces the affinity for p11 binding and on the other hand, p11 binding to p36 interferes with the phosphorylation of p36. Therefore, it may influence several signal transduction pathways (including insulin receptor sorting and internalization) (18Biener Y. Feinstein R. Mayak M. Kaburagi Y. Kadowaki T. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29489-29496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies in Nb2 (T lymphoma) cells suggested that an increase in p11 level may decrease cell proliferation (19Gerke V. Heizmann C.W. p11, A Member of the S-100 Protein Family, Is Associated with the Tyrosine Kinase Substrate p36 (Annexin II). Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 139-155Google Scholar). (p36)2(p11)2complex may also increase c-raf-1 kinase activity (20Matsumoto T. Murao S. Kito K. Kihana T. Matsuura S. Ueda N. Pathol. Int. 1997; 47: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Annexin II-p11 tetramer may also act as a surface protein receptor for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator. Extracellular p11 binds to plasminogen and increases plasmin generation (21Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Nitric oxide is a potent transcriptional regulator influencing a variety of genes including genes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism. Modulation of promoter activity by NO has been reported to occur by either cGMP-dependent or -independent mechanisms and can result in either up-regulation or down-regulation of gene transcription (7von Knethen A. Brune B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Van Dervort A.L. Yan L. Madara P.J. Cobb J.P. Wesley R.A. Corriveau C.C. Tropea M.M. Danner R.L. J.

Many promoter studies were done using relatively long promoter regions that appear to be involved in NO-mediated responses. Some studies also concentrated on identification of transcription factors involved in NO-dependent promoter regulation. These studies have identified the following nitric oxide response elements: NF-κB (22Lander H.M. Sehajpal P.K. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7182-7187PubMed Google Scholar), AP-1 (23Tabuchi A. Oh E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), heat shock factor 1 (24Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and SP-1 (12Wang S. Wang W. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33190-33193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), all of which undergo increased or decreased DNA binding upon exposure of cells or cell extract to exogenous NO. Redox-sensitive transcription factors (such as SP-1) bind to DNA via three zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 (24Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. Clementi E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and zinc is easily displaced by a redox reaction or thiol compounds (25Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Some data also suggest that nitric oxide decreased transcription factor binding (NF-κB and c-jun) by S-nitrosylation (26delaTorre A. Schroeder R.A. Bartlett S.T. Kuo P.C. Surgery. 1998; 124: 137-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies taken together also suggest that nitric oxide may act through a variety of nuclear proteins and that the final effect is promoter-specific.In this study, we show that p11 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells is stimulated by nitric oxide and that this process is mediated by cGMP activation and the binding of AP-1 complex to an AP-1-binding site located at −82 to −77 of p11 promoter. This effect was confirmed using three different nitric oxide donors (SP, SNAP, and SNOG) in a relatively broad range of concentrations from 10 to 500 μm. SNAP and SNOG are able to enhance nuclear protein binding by S-nitrosylation, whereas SP is unable to mediate this process. A similar effect of all three nitric oxide donors suggests that p11 accumulation is not mediated throughS-nitrosylation. These effects appeared to be time- and dose-dependent.To confirm that this effect is mediated at the transcriptional level, we assayed steady state mRNA levels showing that p11 mRNA levels are increased in response to NO donors in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A p11 reporter gene containing 188 base pairs 5′ of the transcription start site responded to NO donors. Incubation of epithelial cells with nitric oxide donors also significantly increased nuclear protein binding to the AP-1-binding site in the p11 promoter. This effect was blocked when cells were preincubated with a PKG inhibitor and was mimicked by a cell permeable cGMP analogue. To reconfirm this finding we mutated the AP-1 site in a −188+89 reporter construct and this reporter gene did not respond to an NO donor. Similarly, the p11 reporter gene did not respond to SP in cells co-transfected with an AP-1 dominant negative plasmid.Nitric oxide may modulate activator protein-1 binding activity byS-nitrosylation. This has been reported to decrease the AP-1 complex binding to DNA (23Tabuchi A. Oh E. Taoka A. Sakurai H. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, protein kinase G is able to mediate phosphorylation of various transcription factors including activator protein-1 complex proteins. This effect significantly increased binding to DNA (27Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Due to the fact that KT 5823 and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS, PKG inhibitors, were found to decrease AP-1 complex binding activity and abolished the NO effect on the expression of p11 protein and p11 promoter activity we conclude that the p11 promoter is activated through AP-1 complex phosphorylation leading to increased binding. We confirmed the fact that protein kinase G is playing a crucial role in nitric oxide-induced p11 accumulation using a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (ODQ) and a cell permeable cGMP analogue. ODQ preincubation completely inhibited the NO effect on p11 promoter activity in transfected BEAS-2B cells suggesting guanylate cyclase involvement. The fact that a cGMP analogue is able to mimic the NO effect on p11 promoter activity and protein expression further confirms this hypothesis.Recently the fos gene was reported to be regulated via soluble guanylate cyclase and type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase although a putative NO/cGMP responsive promoter element was not described for this gene (28Idriss S.D.

An NO/cGMP/PKG/AP-1 pathway was confirmed for the tumor necrosis factor-α promoter (29Gertzberg N. Clements R. Jaspers I. Ferro T.J. Neumann P. Flescher E. Johnson A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in pulmonary endothelial cells. Similarly, nitric oxide stimulates transforming growth factor β-1 release from human alveolar epithelial cells through protein kinase G activation (30Bellocq A. Azoulay E. Marullo S. Flahault A. Fouqueray B. Philippe C. Cadranel J. Baud L. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), although the transcription factor involved in this process was not postulated. These data suggest the importance of NO-dependent phosphorylation of activator protein one complex in promoter activation in human lung cells.While p11 has been reported to play a variety of roles in cellular function (17Johnstone S.A.

Matsuura S. Ueda N. Pathol. Int. 1997; 47: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We believe that nitric oxide activation of AP-1 binding in the p11 promoter is one of the mechanisms by which this effect may occur. p11, or calpactin light chain, is a member of the S-100 family of small, calcium-binding proteins; however, it has several unique features. S-100 proteins contain two EF-hands that function as calcium-binding domains (2Gerke V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1106-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). p11 does not have the ability to bind Ca2+ ions due to amino acid deletions and substitutions in the two EF-hand motifs. Instead, p11 is present in a variety of cells separately or as a heterotetramer with annexin II (p36). The heterotetramer is composed of two copies of the 36-kDa heavy chain, annexin II, subunits and two copies of 11-kDa light chain (p11) subunits as (p36)2(p11)2 (2Gerke V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 1106-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 14Erikson E. Tomasiewicz H.G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2057085990,"Transcriptional regulation is commonly associated with local levels of histone acetylation, which controls chromatin structure at specific genes or within contiguous chromosomal domains. Less well understood are the higher order determinants of histone acetylation. The transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), concentrates at one higher order structure, the peri-centromeric chromatin, and regulates differentiation in many cell types, including pituitary cells. We used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to show that immunostained acetylated histone H3 is relatively absent from peri-centromeric domains visible as large structures in mouse pituitary progenitor GHFT1-5 cells. GHFT1-5 cells do not contain C/EBPα. We observed that expression of C/EBPα in GHFT1-5 cells leads to an increased level of acetylated histone H3, but not acetylated histone H4, at the peri-centromeric domains. Only transcriptionally active forms of C/EBPα altered histone acetylation at the peri-centromeric domain. The altered state of histone acetylation at large intranuclear domains may complement, counteract, or supercede the more gene-local activities of other transcription factors to coordinate C/EBPα-induced cellular differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2170301845,"Group IIa phospholipase A2 (GIIa PLA2) is released by some cells in response to interleukin-1β. The purpose of this study was to determine whether interleukin-1β would stimulate the synthesis and release of GIIa PLA2 from cardiomyocytes, and to define the role of p38 MAPK and cytosolic PLA2 in the regulation of this process. Whereas GIIa PLA2 mRNA was not identified in untreated cells, exposure to interleukin-1β resulted in the sustained expression of GIIa PLA2 mRNA. Interleukin-1β also stimulated a progressive increase in cellular and extracellular GIIa PLA2 protein levels and increased extracellular PLA2 activity 70-fold. In addition, interleukin-1β stimulated the p38 MAPK-dependent activation of the downstream MAPK-activated protein kinase, MAPKAP-K2. Treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190, decreased interleukin-1β stimulated MAPKAP-K2 activity, GIIa PLA2mRNA expression, GIIa PLA2 protein synthesis, and the release of extracellular PLA2 activity. Infection with an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active form of MKK6, MKK6(Glu), which selectively phosphorylates p38 MAPK, induced cellular GIIa PLA2 protein synthesis and the release of GIIa PLA2 and increased extracellular PLA2 activity 3-fold. In contrast, infection with an adenovirus encoding a phosphorylation-resistant MKK6, MKK6(A), did not result in GIIa PLA2 protein synthesis or release by unstimulated cardiomyocytes. In addition, infection with an adenovirus encoding MKK6(A) abrogated GIIa PLA2 protein synthesis and release by interleukin-1β-stimulated cells.

These results provide direct evidence that p38 MAPK activation was necessary for interleukin-1β-induced synthesis and release of GIIa PLA2by cardiomyocytes. interleukin-1β phospholipase A2 secretory phospholipase A2 Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 Ca2+-independent cytosolic phospholipase A2 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK kinase 6, ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase N-terminal c-Jun kinase arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2 H-pyran-2-one fetal bovine serum analysis of variance glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase hemagglutinin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor CAAT enhancer-binding protein green fluorescent protein Interleukin-1β (IL-1β)1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of myocardial disease states, including cardiac hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury (1Testa M.

IL-1β is thought to participate in the genesis of these cardiac pathologies through the induction of specific genes, such as inducible nitric-oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, matrix metalloproteinase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and αB-crystallin (4LaPointe M.C.

As the range of genes that are induced by cardiomyocytes following exposure to IL-1β have not been fully defined, the precise mechanisms that lead to the phenotypic changes that follow exposure to IL-1β remain incompletely understood. The effects of IL-1β in cardiomyocytes are mediated, in part, by stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) enzymes. The MAPK enzymes include p38 MAPK, p42/44 MAPK, and JNK. Molecular cloning studies have led to the identification of four distinct p38 MAPK isoforms as follows: p38α, p38β2, p38γ, and p38δ (7Enslen H. Brancho D.M. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The MAPK enzymes exert distinct biological functions, as p38α MAPK promoted apoptosis, whereas p38β2 MAPK promoted myocardial hypertrophy and cell survival (8Nemoto S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 9Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK activity is increased by phosphorylation on a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif by MAPK kinases, including MKK3 and MKK6 (10Derijard B.

Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). MKK6 forms a functional complex with p38 MAPK that is dependent on both the presence of a docking site in the N terminus of the MAPK kinase and the selective recognition of an activation (T-loop) of the individual p38 MAPK isoforms (7Enslen H. Brancho D.M. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and leads to the phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAPK. MKK6 activity is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser-207 and Thr-211. Mutation of Ser-207 and Thr-211 to Glu had the same effect as phosphorylation of these amino acids and resulted in a constitutively active form of the enzyme, MKK6(Glu) (11Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Among the different MAPK enzymes, MKK6(Glu) only activated p38 MAPK in cardiac myocytes (9Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 12Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, MKK6(Glu) phosphorylated p38 MAPK but not JNK1 or ERK2 in vitro and MKK6(Glu) did not activate a phosphorylation-defective (Thr-180 to Ala and Tyr-182 to Phe) p38 MAPK (11Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Therefore, MKK6(Glu) is a potent and selective activator of p38 MAPK that can be used to study the physiologic effects of myocardial p38 MAPK activation in vitro (7Enslen H. Brancho D.M. Davis R.J.

MAPK enzymes have been implicated in the regulation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) expression (14Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). PLA2enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of phospholipids, with the subsequent release of fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, from the sn-2 position (15Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid is the biochemical precursor of the leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and prostaglandins, biologically active metabolites that may modulate the myocardial response to cytokine exposure (16McDonald P.P.

In addition to cPLA2 and iPLA2, a family of 10 extracellular or secreted PLA2 (sPLA2) enzymes has also been described in mammals that include GIb, IIa, IIc, IId, IIe, IIf, III, V, X, and XII PLA2 (19Six D.A.

Whereas some of these sPLA2 enzymes are located in granules and are secreted into the extracellular environment (27Chock S.P. Schmauder-Chock E.A. Cordella-Miele E. Miele L. Mukherjee A.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), others have been identified in the Golgi apparatus, nuclear envelope, plasma membrane, and cytosol (28Bingham III, C.O. Fijneman R.J.

The identity of the sPLA2 enzyme(s) that are expressed and released by cardiomyocytes following exposure to IL-1β have not been defined. GIIa PLA2 is a highly basic protein that is secreted from a number of cells during inflammation and may play a central role in the liberation of arachidonic acid from phospholipids (30Koduri R.S.

In some cell types, cPLA2 activity was required for the expression of GIIa PLA2 (31Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol.

In this study, we show that IL-1β induced GIIa PLA2 gene expression by cardiomyocytes and that p38 MAPK activation was necessary for IL-1β-induced synthesis and release of GIIa PLA2 by these cells. In contrast, cPLA2 activity was not required for IL-1β-induced GIIa PLA2 synthesis by cardiomyocytes. The MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and the inactive control SB202474 were obtained from Calbiochem. Antiserum specific for cPLA2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. The anti-MAPKAP-K2 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Recombinant human IL-1β was from PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ. The cDNAs for rat GIIa PLA2 and cPLA2 were provided by Dr. Brian Kennedy, Merck Sharp and Dohme. Mouse GAPDH cDNA was obtained from Ambion, Austin, TX. Arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) and (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-napthalenyl)-2 H-tetrahydopyran-2-one (HELSS) were from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI. Polyclonal antiserum against recombinant rat GIIa PLA2 was raised in rabbits, and recombinant rat GIIa PLA2, which contains 6 His residues at the C terminus of the protein and migrates at an apparent mass of ∼18 kDa on SDS-PAGE, was synthesized as described (36Nyman K.M. Ojala P. Laine V.J. Nevalainen T.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1469-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recombinant iPLA2 was kindly provided by Dr. Simon Jones (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). LY311727 was kindly provided by Dr. Ed Mihelich, Lilly. All other reagents were analytical or tissue culture grade and were obtained from Sigma. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (12Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were isolated, washed, and cut into 1–2-mm pieces and sequentially digested with 0.15% trypsin in calcium and bicarbonate-free Hanks’ in 12–16 consecutive digestions for 5 min at room temperature. The dissociated cells were pooled, washed, and suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and Ham’s F-12 medium, 1:1, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and plated for 60 min to remove contaminating fibroblasts. After collecting unattached cells, cardiomyocytes were seeded on 60- or 100-mm dishes at a density of 0.9 × 105 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium:F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1 mmbromodeoxyuridine and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for 24 h. Cells were then washed and incubated in serum-free medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 1 nm LiCl, 1 nmSeO2, 25 μg/ml vitamin C, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (medium A). After 24 h (which corresponds to time = 0 in the experimental protocol), cells were washed, resuspended in medium A, and treated with inhibitors or adenoviral vectors, as indicated in the figure legends. When chemicals were dissolved in Me2SO or ethanol, the identical concentrations of these solvents were added to controls. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 1 h before addition of Me2SO or IL-1β, at 10 ng/ml, for up to 72 h. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated 2–6 times. In all studies, cytotoxicity was assessed by monitoring the extracellular release of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Studies in which the release of lactate dehydrogenase or creatine kinase exceeded >5% of total cellular activity were excluded from further analysis. Following exposure to vehicle or SB202190 (10 μm) for 30 min, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for up to 60 min. Cells that were exposed to osmotic stress by incubation with 400 mm sorbitol for 10 min were used as positive controls. Cultures were extracted in 400 μl of MAPKAP-K2 assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium o-vanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following removal of debris by centrifugation, MAPKAP-K2 was immunoprecipitated using 1.5 μg of anti-MAPKAP-K2 and submitted to a kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP and hsp27 as the substrates, as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled hsp27 was then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was then submitted to PhosphorImager analyses, as described (6Hoover H.E. Thuerauf D.J. Martindale J.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Han (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA). Sr3 HA-p38–2, which codes for wild type human p38–2 MAPK, was obtained from B. Stein (38Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Murray B.W. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19509-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Signal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA). p38–2 MAPK is distinct from p38α, p38γ ,and p38δ but is identical to human p38β2 MAPK (39Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The preparation of recombinant adenoviruses encoding MKK6(Glu) and p38-2 MAPK, and infection of cardiomyocytes, was carried out exactly as described previously (13Craig R. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23814-23824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus encoding MKK6b(A) was constructed as follows. A polymerase chain reaction product was created from the cDNA clone, pcDNA3 HA-MKK6b(A), with the following primers: ggcggcggccgccaactagaaggcacagtcgagg (pcDNA3 rev NotI) and ggcggaattcatgtctcagtcgaaaggcaagaag (MKK6b Met EcoRI), which introduced EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. The polymerase chain reaction product was then cloned into pGEX-6P-1, cut from the pGEX construct with BamHI and NotI, and subcloned into the BglII and NotI sites of the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector. The shuttle vector was recombined with pAdEasy-1 to form the viral construct, MKK6(A), as described by He et al. (40He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. J. Yu Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar). Viral titers were determined by observing GFP fluorescence of primary neonatal cardiac myocytes, and the minimum quantity of viral stock that afforded 100% transfection efficiency was selected for the experiments in this study. Extracellular PLA2 activity was determined by measuring the amounts of free [1-14C]oleic acid released from [1-14C]oleic acid-labeled Escherichia coli, according to the protocol developed by Elsbach and Weiss (41Elsbach P. Weiss J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a total volume of 1.5 ml of 0.1m Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 7 mmCaCl2, 10 mg fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 2.8 × 108 radiolabeled E. coli(corresponding to 5.6 nmol of phospholipid). After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by filtration through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter, and the released [1-14C]oleic acid bound to the bovine serum albumin carrier was estimated by liquid scintillation counting, as described (42Pruzanski W. Stefanski E. Vadas P. Kennedy B.P. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All assays were performed in the excess of substrate and corrected for non-enzymatic hydrolysis. 1 unit of PLA2 activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzed 56 pmol of phospholipid substrate in 30 min at 37 °C, which corresponds to 1% of the total E. colisubstrate. Total cellular RNA was extracted from rat cardiomyocytes using the RNeasy system (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Extracted RNA (15 μg) was run on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by capillary blotting. cDNA probes used for hybridization were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After baking at 80 °C, the blot was subjected to hybridization, followed by two 30-min washes with 1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65 °C and three 30-min washes with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Washed membranes were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat) with one intensifying screen at −70 °C for periods ranging from 5 h to 3 days. Films were densitometrically scanned and analyzed using an Imaging densitometer (model GS-690) and the Molecular Analyst program (Bio-Rad). The peptide EEFLKREFGEHTK, which corresponds to amino acids 507–519 of the 85-kDa iPLA2 cloned from Chinese hamster ovary cells (43Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8567-8575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), was polymerized onto a polylysine tree and injected into a rabbit with Freund's complete adjuvant. The serum was collected and affinity-purified with the polylysine tree-linked multiple antigenic peptide, which was fixed to an Immunosorb column, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). In selected studies, plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were incubated in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mmphenylphosphate, 5 mm glycerophosphate, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min, followed by passage through a 21-gauge syringe needle. Cellular lysates were centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at −20 °C for subsequent immunoblotting studies. Cell lysates and cytosolic or microsomal fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 9, 13, or 16.5% gels at a constant 100 V. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3, at 2 mA/cm, followed by overnight blocking in 5% milk and 1% goat serum. The blots were then incubated with primary antibody (see figure legends for specific antibodies) for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection of immunoreactive bands was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence. All results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Comparisons between groups were made by repeated measures analysis of variance, followed by post-hoc analysis with paired t tests. When multiple comparisons between groups were made, a Bonferroni correction was applied. A p value <0.01 was considered to be significant. No GIIa PLA2 mRNA was detected in cardiomyocytes following incubation in culture medium with 10% FBS for 24 h and incubation in medium A (without FBS) for a further 24 h (Fig. 1 A, time = 0) by northern blot analysis. After an additional 72 h in culture, untreated cardiomyocytes still failed to express GIIa PLA2 mRNA (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, treatment with IL-1β resulted in the sustained expression of GIIa PLA2 mRNA. These results are consistent with the notion that IL-1β induced GIIa PLA2 mRNA transcription in cardiomyocytes. To determine whether IL-1β induced GIIa PLA2 protein synthesis and release by cardiomyocytes, cells were treated with IL-1β, and cellular lysates and the extracellular fluid were evaluated by western blot analysis. The anti-GIIa PLA2antibody used in these studies identified recombinant rat GIIa PLA2 but failed to identify recombinant rat GV PLA2 (Fig. 2 A), a closely related protein that is also expressed in cardiomyocytes. 2N.

These functions are regulated by several factors including the E2F-1-binding protein MDM2 and the retinoblastoma protein pRb. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen we have identified the MDM2-related protein, MDMX, as an E2F-1-binding protein. In these studies we find that coexpression of MDMX with E2F-1 results in degradation of the MDMX protein. Although this proteolytic degradation can be blocked by the protease inhibitors bafilomycin A1, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-AL, and N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-AL, MDMX degradation is not inhibited by lactacystin, suggesting that degradation occurs by a proteasome-independent mechanism. Using an E2F-1 deletion mutant (E2F-1(180–437)) we show that E2F-1-targeted degradation of MDMX does not require the E2F-1 DNA binding domain and therefore is independent of E2F-1-driven transcription. We also find that this transcriptionally inactive E2F-1 mutant is capable of degrading the MDMX-related protein MDM2 and the MDMX isoform MDMX-S. Mapping of the E2F-1 C terminus reveals that neither a previously characterized C-terminal MDM2 binding domain nor the pRb binding domain on E2F-1 is required for MDMX and MDM2 degradation.

E2F-1 controls cell cycle transit in part by regulating transcription of genes whose products are involved in DNA synthesis. E2F-1 accomplishes this by binding DNA as a heterodimer with a Dp family member (1Bandara L.R. Buck V.M. Zamanian M. Johnston L.H. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4317-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2La Thangue N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The ability of E2F-1 to regulate transcription is in turn controlled by the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which inhibits E2F-1 activity by binding to the C-terminal transactivation domain of E2F-1 (3Nevins J.R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 4Horowitz J.M.

Phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin D-dependent kinase is a defining event of G1/S checkpoint progression because it results in the dissociation of pRb from the E2F-1·Dp-1 complex, allowing E2F-1 to activate transcription of its target genes. Early studies indicated that both E2F-1-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle progression were dependent on E2F-1 transcriptional activity. Interestingly, activation of apoptosis is unique to E2F-1 among the E2F family members (6DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). E2F-1-driven apoptosis occurs by multiple mechanisms including both p53-dependent and -independent pathways (7Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 8Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests a requirement for the E2F-1 DNA binding domain for E2F-1-activated apoptosis (9Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Activation of apoptosis by E2F-1 occurs in part through the transcriptional induction of both the p14/ARF1 and p73 genes (10Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R.

Nature. 2000; 407: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The p73 protein, a p53 homolog, activates programmed cell death in a matter analogous to p53, through the transactivation of apoptotic genes (12Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar). The p14/ARF tumor suppressor enhances apoptosis through the p53 pathway by increasing protein degradation of MDM2, the major p53 antagonist, thereby elevating p53 levels and leading to apoptosis (13Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Leone G. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H.

Although E2F-1 can reduce MDM2 protein levels and function, MDM2 can also affect E2F-1 function. MDM2 binds the C terminus of E2F-1 and modulates E2F-1 transcriptional activity (16Martin K. Trouche D. Hagemeier C. Sorensen T.S. La Thangue N.B. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1995; 375: 691-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 17Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A.J. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). MDM2 expression in cells has also been shown recently to result in a decrease in E2F-1 protein levels (18Loughran O. La Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2186-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus by reducing E2F-1 protein levels, MDM2 can inhibit E2F-1-driven apoptosis. In addition to its role as a negative regulator of E2F-1, MDM2 also antagonizes the p53 tumor suppressor (19Momand J. Zambetti G.P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). MDM2 inhibits p53-driven transcription by multiple mechanisms, including direct binding and blocking of the p53 transactivation domain (20Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). Additionally, MDM2 targets p53 for degradation in the proteasome by functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase specific for p53 (22Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 23Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As a result of this ability to inhibit p53, MDM2 plays a role in promoting transformation (24Finlay C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, increased MDM2 protein levels have been observed in a broad spectrum of human tumors (25Flores C. Sobrevia L. Rev. Med. Chile. 2000; 128: 539-546PubMed Google Scholar). The MDM2-related protein MDMX shares several of the same structural and functional properties of MDM2, including a highly conserved p53 binding domain capable of binding and inhibiting the transactivation domain of p53 (26Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although MDMX can bind p53 and block its ability to activate transcription and induce apoptosis, MDMX protein can also increase the stability of p53 protein by binding MDM2 through a conserved C-terminal RING finger domain (28Bottger V. Bottger A. Garcia-Echeverria C. Ramos Y.F. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The MDMX-MDM2 interaction has been shown to inhibit MDM2-targeted degradation of p53 protein (29Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). For example, binding of MDMX by MDM2 significantly increases the stability of the MDM2 protein with no change in MDMX stability (30Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouza K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar,31Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although the MDMX-MDM2 interaction has led to recent insights into the autoregulation of the MDM family of proteins, it is not currently known what effect MDMX has on E2F-1 function and vice versa. Here we show that E2F-1 can significantly decrease the steady-state levels of the MDMX protein and that the decrease in MDMX occurs by a proteolytic mechanism that is independent of the proteasome. Phoenix, 293T, Saos2, and U-2 OS cells were maintained at 37 °C under 4% CO2 and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhitaker) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biological). Phoenix cells are a derivative of 293 cells which have a very high efficiency of transfection (80–90%) by standard calcium phosphate methods. 24 h before transfection, phoenix and 293T cells were split 1:7 by the calcium phosphate method with a Profection kit (Promega). 24 h before transfection, confluent U-2 OS cells were split 1:4 with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Cells were then harvested 48 h after transfection. Extracts for the luciferase reporter assay were generated by resuspending cells in 0.25 m Tris (pH 7.8) and then sequentially freezing and thawing them in a 37 °C water bath for three cycles. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Protein concentrations for each sample were determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Equal protein concentrations from each sample were measured for luciferase activity using luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). For the protease inhibitor experiments, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection and replaced with 10% fetal calf serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing its respected protease inhibitor.N-Acetyl-Leu-Leu-Norleu-AL (ALLN; Sigma) andN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Met-AL (ALLM; Sigma) were used at a final concentration of 1.25 μg/ml. Bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml, PD150606 (Calbiochem) at a concentration of 20 μm, zVAD-FMK (Enzyme Systems Inc.) at a concentration of 20 μm, and lactacystin (Calbiochem) was used at a final concentration of 10 mm.

Each cDNA was then cloned 3′ to a FLAG epitope tag sequence within the Bluescript KS plasmid. The FLAG epitope containing the desired cDNA within the same reading frame was then subcloned into the pCDNA3 plasmid downstream of the CMV promoter. Creation of the E2F-1(180–437(DF-GG)) double point mutant was done by site-directed mutagenesis using pRC-CMV-E2F-1(180–437) as template. Two purified oligonucleotides (5′-GCATGTGCGGGAGGCCGCCTCCGGCCTCCTCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGAGGAGGCCGGAGGCGGCCTCCCGCACATGC-3′), containing the desired mutations, were hybridized to the template and extended usingPfu polymerase (Stratagene). This reaction was repeated for 15 cycles, then template DNA was digested by incubation with theDpnI restriction enzyme for 1 h. E2F-1(180–437) and E2F-1(1–415) deletion mutants were created by amplification of the desired regions by PCR. To generate extracts, cells were harvested by scraping in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then spun at 1,200 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cytosolic extracts were generated by lysing the cells on ice in 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm), benzamidine (1 μg/ml), pepstatin (2 μg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min, and the soluble fraction was termedcytosol. The nuclei were resuspended in extraction buffer consisting of 0.42 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin for 10 min on ice and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 8 min to pellet the residual nuclear material. The supernatant fraction from this centrifugation spin was termed nuclear extract. Equal quantities of protein extracts were separated by size using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) and blocked for 30 min in 5% dry milk and resuspended in TBST buffer (10 mmTris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The nitrocellulose blots were incubated in primary antibody for 1 h on a shaker at room temperature. The blots were washed three times with TBST for 5 min and then incubated in secondary antibody on a shaker for 30 min at room temperature. The blots were washed in TBST again three times for 5 min each wash on a shaker at room temperature. Blots were developed using the Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) chemiluminescent reagents and X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Primary antibodies for immunoblot analysis were diluted in 3% dry milk and TBST at the following ratios: 1:2,000 anti-E2F-1 Ab-1 (Calbiochem), 1:5,000 M2 anti-FLAG (Kodak), 1:1,000 anti-MDM2 Ab-1 (Calbiochem), 1:2,000 anti-Dp-1 K-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:2,000 anti-pRb C-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 1:2,000 anti-BRCA1 Ab-1 (Oncogene Research Products). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) secondary antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 in 3% dry milk and TBST. 35S-Labeled in vitrotranslated MDMX protein was generated by incubating 1 μg of pRc-CMV-MDMX plasmid along with 35S-radiolabeled methionine in T7 Quick (Promega) rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 1 h at 30 °C. GST-Dp-1 was created by amplifying the desired cDNAs by PCR and then ligating the cDNA in-frame behind the GST sequence of the pGEX-2TK plasmid. GST fusion proteins were generated within the HB101 strain ofEscherichia coli. Bacteria cultures transformed with the appropriate pGEX expression plasmid were grown under ampicillin medium at 37 °C overnight. The confluent bacteria culture was then diluted 1:10 in selective medium and grown for 1 h at 37 °C prior to induction of GST expression with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h of induction cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mmNa2HPO4 (pH 7), 30 mm NaCl, 0.25% Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmEDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then sonicated. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. GST fusion proteins were affinity purified on mini-batch columns of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on ice for 30 min. Beads containing GST fusions were then rinsed three times with 1.0 ml of lysis buffer. GST fusions used in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments were removed from the Sephadex beads by incubating with 5 mm reduced glutathione for 30 min at 4 °C. In an effort to identify E2F-1-associated proteins, we set up a two-hybrid yeast screen using portions of E2F-1 as bait (linked to LexA). We isolated a number of cDNAs whose products appear to interact with E2F-1 in yeast. One positive clone from this screen was the MDMX protein, an MDM2-related factor. We could demonstrate a clear interaction between E2F-1 and MDMX in an in vitro assay. This is shown in the GST pull-down assay in Fig.1 A. From the figure it is clear that MDMX associates well with E2F-1 but not with GST alone or with GST-Dp1. However, attempts to show an in vivointeraction between E2F-1 and MDMX were unsuccessful, as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in extracts of cells transfected with E2F-1 and MDMX expression vectors. Interestingly, Western blot analysis of these same extracts revealed a significant reduction in MDMX protein when coexpressed with E2F-1. As shown in Fig. 1 B, ectopically expressed MDMX protein is easily detectable in cell extracts by Western blot analysis after transient transfection of the MDMX expression vector. The upper band is a normal product of MDMX and may represent a modified form of the protein. Interestingly, when MDMX is coexpressed with E2F-1 protein, the steady-state level of MDMX was diminished markedly, but the level of E2F-1 was unaffected (Fig.1 B). These data indicate that E2F-1 expression appears to reduce the level of the MDMX protein. It has been shown previously that the E2F-1 transcription factor targets the degradation of the MDM2 protein (14Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). This is likely because E2F-1 transcriptionally activates the p14/ARF gene, whose protein product can in turn target the destruction of MDM2 by the proteasome. It is possible that E2F-1 could similarly be directing the breakdown of MDMX by the transactivation of the p14/ARF gene. To test whether E2F-1-mediated reduction in the MDMX protein is dependent on E2F-1-driven transcription, an N-terminal deletion mutant of E2F-1, termed E2F-1(180–437), was created which lacks the DNA binding domain (Fig. 2 A) yet retains the activation domain and the pRb binding domain. Fig.2 B demonstrates that the N-terminal 179 amino acids of E2F-1 are essential for transcriptional activation of the p14/ARF promoter in a transient transfection assay. Although full-length E2F-1 is capable of enhancing the activation of a luciferase reporter construct driven by the ARF promoter (by more than 13-fold), E2F-1(180–437) is completely ineffective at activating the ARF promoter. Interestingly, E2F-1(180–437) is capable of decreasing the amount of coexpressed MDMX protein significantly, to an extent similar to that of the full-length E2F-1 protein (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that the E2F-1-mediated reduction in MDMX protein is independent of E2F-1-driven transcription and activation of the ARF promoter. These data also indicate that only the C-terminal half of the E2F-1 protein is required for the reduction in MDMX protein levels. To determine whether the E2F-1-induced reduction in steady-state MDMX protein is specific to the MDMX protein, we tested to see if E2F-1(180–437) could alter the levels of the E2F-1-binding proteins Dp-1, pRb, the ZF87/MAZ transcription factor (34Pyrc J.J. Moberg K.H. Hall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4102-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), or the BRCA1 protein. Ectopically expressed ZF87/MAZ, pRb, BRCA1, and Dp-1 are readily detectable in cell extracts by immunoblot assay after transient transfection of the respective expression plasmids (Fig. 3,A–D). Although E2F-1(180–437) was capable of greatly reducing MDMX protein levels (Fig. 3 A), it had no effect on the steady-state protein levels of the ZF87/MAZ, Dp-1, or pRb proteins (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). These results suggest that E2F-1-targeted reduction in MDMX protein levels may be specific for the MDMX protein. Interestingly, E2F-1(180–437) was able to target the BRCA1 protein for degradation (see Fig. 3 D). As will be discussed below, this appears consistent with a certain type of proteolytic mechanism activated by E2F-1. From the above it appears that pRb protein levels are not affected by E2F-1. However, pRb is known to block proteasomal degradation of MDM2 by repressing E2F-1-driven transactivation of p14/ARF (14Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether pRb could regulate the E2F-1(180–437)-targeted reduction of MDMX, so we coexpressed pRb, E2F-1(180–437), and MDMX proteins in cells and measured the relative quantity of MDMX protein by Western blot analysis (Fig.4 A). We found that coexpression of the retinoblastoma protein was unable to block E2F-1(180–437)-targeted reduction of MDMX. The inability of pRb to block MDMX reduction is further evidence that the E2F-1(180–437)-induced reduction of MDMX is independent of E2F-1-driven transcription. A recent study done in Saos2 cells demonstrates that MDM2 can reduce the quantity of E2F-1 protein when the Dp-1 protein is present (18Loughran O. La Thangue N.B. Mol. Cell.

To test whether the Dp-1 protein inhibits the MDMX protein reduction, we coexpressed E2F-1, Dp-1, and MDMX proteins in cells and measured the relative quantity of MDMX protein. As seen in Fig. 4 B, Dp-1 expression was unable to inhibit the E2F-1-induced reduction of MDMX. Thus, Dp1 dimerization with E2F-1 does not affect the mechanism by which E2F-1 degrades MDMX. We were next interested in determining whether E2F-1 was reducing MDMX protein levels by increasing MDMX degradation through a specific proteolytic pathway. We therefore tested whether several protease inhibitors could block E2F-1(180–437)-mediated reduction of MDMX. Because the level of reduction of MDMX by E2F-1 was so great it was thought necessary to achieve more moderate levels of reduction which could be overcome by the protease inhibitor. It was first necessary therefore to reduce the amount of transfected the E2F-1(180–437)-expressing plasmid. Fig.5 A demonstrates that there is a dose dependence to E2F-1-targeted reduction of MDMX in that as the amount of cotransfected E2F-1 plasmid is decreased the level of MDM protein increases. We then analyzed several protease inhibitors for the ability to block the reduction of MDMX protein by a low dose of E2F-1(180–437) expression plasmid, as shown in Fig. 5 B. First, through the use of the competitive proteasome inhibitor ALLN and its proteasome-ineffective analog ALLM we determined whether there was any dependence on proteasome function (35Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.5 B, both ALLN and ALLM were capable of blocking E2F-1(180–437)-targeted reduction of MDMX. Although this suggests that the reduction of steady-state MDMX by E2F-1 is caused by proteolytic degradation of the MDMX protein, it appears that this MDMX degradation is not dependent on the proteasome (note that ALLN and ALLM inhibit the action of other proteases, as discussed below). To test further the dependence of the proteasome we analyzed lactacystin for its ability to prevent E2F-1(180–437)-targeted MDMX degradation. Lactacystin is a potent irreversible inhibitor that is highly specific for the proteasome (36Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Lactacystin was unable to block the relative decrease in MDMX protein resulting from E2F-1(180–437) expression (Fig.5 B). It is therefore likely that a proteolytic mechanism separate from the proteasome exists and that it is activated by E2F-1 and capable of degrading MDMX. As just mentioned, in addition to being a competitive inhibitor of the proteasome, ALLN is a potent inhibitor of both calpain and cathepsin-like proteases, a characteristic retained by the ALLM analog (37Inoue S. Bar-Nun S. Roitelman J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13311-13317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of the broad cathepsin inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (38Oda K. Nishimura Y. Ikehara Y. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) for its ability to block E2F-1(180–437)-targeted degradation of the MDMX protein. Similarly to ALLN and ALLM, bafilomycin A1 is able to block the E2F-1(180–437)-targeted degradation of MDMX protein (Fig.5 B). We saw no increase in the steady-state quantity of MDMX protein when we treated cells with the caspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK (39Craighead M.W. Tiwari P. Keynes R.G. Waters C.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or the calpain inhibitor PD150606 (40Wang K.K. Nath R. Posner A. Raser K.J. Buroker-Kilgore M. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert A.W. Marcoux F.W. Ye Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. Caner H. Collins J.L. Fergus A. Lee K.S. Lunney E.A. Hays S.J. Yuen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6687-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that E2F-1-targeted degradation of MDMX occurs through the activation of a cathepsin-like protease. As a control, we determined whether the E2F-1(180–437) protein could reduce relative MDMX mRNA levels. We performed RT-PCR from mRNA isolated from phoenix cells transiently transfected with control, MDMX, E2F-1(180–437), and MDMX/E2F-1(180–437) expression plasmids. We found that the presence of E2F-1(180–437) does not reduce the steady-state levels of MDMX mRNA (Fig. 5 C). These data in total suggest that the reduction in MDMX protein is the result of MDMX protein degradation and not an effect on MDMX transcript levels. Because E2F-1 is able to affect the steady-state protein levels of MDMX, it was important to determine whether this effect included other MDM family members. It has been reported previously that MDM2 protein levels can be reduced by the expression of E2F-1 (14Bates S. Phillips A.C. Clark P.A. Stott F. Peters G. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 124-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, this may be because E2F-1 induces the transcriptional activation of p14/ARF, which targets MDM2 for degradation in the proteasome. Because it is possible that E2F-1 targets MDM2 for degradation by multiple mechanisms, we determined whether E2F-1(180–437) was capable of reducing the steady-state levels of MDM2 protein. MDM2 protein is easily detectable by immunoblot after transient transfection of cells with an MDM2 expression plasmid (Fig.6 A). Coexpression of the E2F-1(180–437) protein with MDM2 greatly reduced the quantity of MDM2 protein, similar to what has been seen for MDMX. These data indicate that a transcriptionally inactive E2F-1 is capable of reducing steady-state levels of both MDMX and MDM2. Interestingly, coexpression of the MDMX protein was unable to block the E2F-1(180–437)-mediated reduction in MDM2 protein. Although both MDM2 and MDMX proteins are susceptible to protease degradation induced by the transcriptionally inactive E2F-1(180–437) it is not clear which regions of the MDM proteins are targeted for degradation. Therefore, to explore the specificity of E2F-1-targeted degradation of the MDM proteins, we analyzed the effects of E2F-1 on MDMX-S. MDMX-S is an isoform of MDMX, encoding a truncated MDMX protein containing only the N-terminal p53 binding domain of MDMX (shown in Fig. 6 B) (33Rallapalli R. Strachan G. Cho B. Mercer W.E. Hall D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8299-8308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition to MDMX-S, an MDMX N-terminal deletion mutant, termed MDMXd114 (shown in Fig. 6 B), was created which has no amino acids in common with MDMX-S. The MDMX-S and MDMXd114 proteins were easi"
