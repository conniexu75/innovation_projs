https://openalex.org/W2155090722,"Clinical, genetic, and neuropsychopharmacological studies of developmental factors in alcoholism are providing a better understanding of the neurobiological bases of personality and learning. Studies of the adopted-away children of alcoholics show that the predisposition to initiate alcohol-seeking behavior is genetically different from susceptibility to loss of control after drinking begins. Alcohol-seeking behavior is a special case of exploratory appetitive behavior and involves different neurogenetic processes than do susceptibility to behavioral tolerance and dependence on the antianxiety or sedative effects of alcohol. Three dimensions of personality have been described that may reflect individual differences in brain systems modulating the activation, maintenance, and inhibition of behavioral responses to the effects of alcohol and other environmental stimuli. These personality traits distinguish alcoholics with different patterns of behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuropharmacological responses to alcohol."

https://openalex.org/W1988276998,"An efficient strategy for mapping human genes that cause recessive traits has been devised that uses mapped restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and the DNA of affected children from consanguineous marriages. The method involves detection of the disease locus by virtue of the fact that the adjacent region will preferentially be homozygous by descent in such inbred children. A single affected child of a first-cousin marriage is shown to contain the same total information about linkage as a nuclear family with three affected children. Calculations show that it should be practical to map a recessive disease gene by studying DNA from fewer than a dozen unrelated, affected inbred children, given a complete RFLP linkage map. The method should make it possible to map many recessive diseases for which it is impractical or impossible to collect adequate numbers of families with multiple affected offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2055654988,"Two glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) located 2.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the tyrosine aminotransferase gene were identified by gene transfer experiments and shown to bind to purified glucocorticoid receptor. Although the proximal GRE has no inherent capacity by itself to stimulate transcription, when present in conjunction with the distal GRE, this element synergistically enhances glucocorticoid induction of gene expression. Cooperativity of the two GREs is maintained when they are transposed upstream of a heterologous promoter. An oligonucleotide of 22 bp representing the distal GRE is sufficient to confer glucocorticoid inducibility. As evidenced by the mapping of DNAase I hypersensitive sites, local alterations in the structure of chromatin at the GREs take place as a consequence of hormonal treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2167889770,"The determination of cell fates during the assembly of the ommatidia in the compound eye of Drosophila appears to be controlled by cell-cell interactions. In this process, the sevenless gene is essential for the development of a single type of photoreceptor cell. In the absence of proper sevenless function the cells that would normally become the R7 photoreceptors instead become nonneuronal cells. Previous morphological and genetic analysis has indicated that the product of the sevenless gene is involved in reading or interpreting the positional information that specifies this particular developmental pathway. The sevenless gene has now been isolated and characterized. The data indicate that sevenless encodes a transmembrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain. This structural similarity between sevenless and certain hormone receptors suggests that similar mechanisms are involved in developmental decisions based on cell-cell interaction and physiological or developmental changes induced by diffusible factors."

https://openalex.org/W2161024497,"von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (VRNF) is one of the most common inherited disorders affecting the human nervous system. VRNF is transmitted as an autosomal dominant defect with high penetrance but variable expressivity. The disorder is characterized clinically by hyperpigmented patches of skin (café au lait macules, axillary freckles) and by multiple tumors of peripheral nerve, spinal nerve roots, and brain (neurofibromas, optic gliomas). These tumors can cause disfigurement, paralysis, blindness, and death. We have determined the chromosomal location of the VRNF gene by genetic linkage analysis using DNA markers. The VRNF gene is genetically linked to the locus encoding nerve growth factor receptor, located on the long arm of chromosome 17 in the region 17q12----17q22. However, crossovers with the VRNF locus suggest that a mutation in the nerve growth factor receptor gene itself is unlikely to be the fundamental defect responsible for the VRNF phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W2050589769,"Careful comparison of symptomatic individuals with normal controls has revealed the primary biochemical abnormality in many human genetic diseases, particularly recessive disorders. This strategy has proved less successful for most human disorders which are not recessive, and where a single copy of the aberrant gene has clinically significant effects even though the normal gene product is present. An alternative approach that eliminates the impediment of a normal protein in affected individuals is to study homozygotes for the mutant allele. For virtually all dominant human disorders in which homozygotes have been described, symptoms have been significantly more severe in the homozygote than in the heterozygote. Thus, these disorders do not conform to the classical definition of dominance which states that homozygotes and heterozygotes for a defect are phenotypically indistinguishable. Instead, they display incomplete dominance, indicating that the normal allele may play a role in ameliorating the disease process. The D4S10 locus, defined by the probe G8 and linked to the gene for Huntington's disease (HD), has permitted us to identify individuals with a high probability of being homozygous for this autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. These homozygotes do not differ in clinical expression or course from typical HD heterozygotes. HD appears to be the first human disease of genetically documented homozygosity that displays complete phenotypic dominance."

https://openalex.org/W2140998993,"The role of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) in mitochondrial protein import was investigated with the precursors of N. crassa carrier, F1-ATPase subunit β, F0-ATPase subunit 9, and fusion proteins between subunit 9 and mouse dihydrofolate reductase. NTPs were necessary for the initial interaction of precursors with the mitochondria and for the completion of translocation of precursors from the mitochondrial surface into the mitochondria. Higher levels of NTPs were required for the latter reactions as compared with the early stages of import. Import of precursors having identical presequences but different mature protein parts required different levels of NTPs. The sensitivity of precursors in reticulocyte lysate to proteases was decreased by removal of NTPs and increased by their readdition. We suggest that the hydrolysis of NTPs is involved in modulating the folding state of precursors in the cytosol, thereby conferring import competence."
https://openalex.org/W1987479068,"Sequencing of an open reading frame associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in Petunia has revealed a gene fusion (the Pcf gene) containing the 5'-flanking and amino-terminal transmembrane segment of the ATP synthase proteolipid gene (atp9), parts of the cytochrome oxidase subunit II (coxII) coding region, and the carboxyl terminus and 3'-flanking region of an unidentified reading frame (urfS). The coxII region has several small deletions and tandem repeats that remove all of the segments coding for the residues involved in copper binding, but may possibly maintain the cytochrome c binding site. Normal atp9 and coxII genes and their transcripts are also present in the sterile cytoplasm. S1 nuclease protection studies identify fused gene transcripts only in CMS lines, with an increase in transcript amount in anthers relative to leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1540989796,"In plant cells, transient changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels can modulate numerous developmental processes. Ca2+ is accumulated in the vacuole via a H+/Ca2+ antiport system that is energized by the tonoplast H+-pumping ATPase. Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3), but not inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, myo-inositol 1-phosphate, or fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, caused a transient reduction of Ca2+ levels in tonoplast vesicles. The decrease was dependent on InsP3 concentration (Km apparent = 0.6 microM). The InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was blocked by the Ca2+ antagonist, 8-(N,N-diethylamino)-octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate-HCl. These results suggest that the vacuolar membrane is one target site for InsP3 action and that InsP3 may operate as a second messenger in the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in plant cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964409706,"Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone that is released from atria and regulates a number of physiological processes, including steroidogenesis in adrenal cortex and testes. The parallel stimulation of membrane guanylate cyclase and corticosterone production in isolated fasciculata cells of rat adrenal cortex has supported the hypothesis of a mediatory role for cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in signal transduction. A novel particulate guanylate cyclase tightly coupled with ANF receptor was purified approximately 273,000-fold by two-step affinity chromatography. The enzyme had a molecular size of 180 kilodaltons and was acidic in nature with a pI of 4.7. Its specific activity was 1800 nanomoles of cyclic GMP formed per minute per milligram of protein. The purified enzyme bound ANF with a specific binding activity of 4.01 nanomoles per milligram of protein, a value that is close to the theoretical binding activity of 5.55 nanomoles per milligram of protein for 1 mole of the ligand binding 1 mole of the receptor protein. These results indicate that the guanylate cyclase-coupled ANF receptor exists in a 180-kilodalton protein of rat adrenocortical carcinoma and represent a step toward the elucidation of the basic mechanism of cyclic GMP-mediated transmembrane signal transduction in response to a hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2003977946,"Two histidine-rich protein genes in Plasmodium falciparum are related by an ancestral duplication and interchromosomal transposition. We have followed the inheritance of these genes in a cross between two clones of P. falciparum. Examination of progeny shows that one gene, encoding the protein HRP-II, behaves as expected and may be inherited from either parent. The other gene, encoding HRP-III, has been found to derive from one parent in all progeny examined. We conclude the linkage group marked by HRP-III is favored strongly in the cross. This linkage group spans a region at one end of chromosome 13. Growth studies suggest the favored inheritance is explained by rapid expansion of progeny possessing the HRP-III marker relative to slower growth of progeny without it."
https://openalex.org/W2081302659,"The murine epidermis contains a subpopulation of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes that have a dendritic morphology and that express Thy-1 and T3 cell-surface antigens but not other markers (L3T4 or Lyt-2) characteristic of mature peripheral T lymphocytes. An alternative type of T cell receptor was earlier identified on a subpopulation of murine thymocytes with a similar phenotype (T3+, L3T4-, Lyt-2-), but not on peripheral murine T lymphocytes. Two independently derived Thy-1+, L3T4-, and Lyt-2- dendritic cell lines of epidermal origin that express a T3-associated disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of a 34-kilodalton γ-chain and 46-kilodalton partner (the δ chain) have now been identified. Analysis of N-linked glycosylation revealed that this receptor is similar to that detected on thymocytes. These results demonstrate that Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cell lines can express γδ T cell receptors in vitro and suggest that Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells express such receptors in vivo. The localization of these γδ T cell receptor-expressing cells in the epidermis may be of importance for understanding the function of these receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1984390448,"The biogenesis of Escherichia coli Pap pili, encoded by the pap gene cluster, was studied. A novel gene, papH, was identified and found to encode a weakly expressed pilin-like protein. PapH was dispensable for digalactoside-specific binding and for formation of Pap pili. However, in papH deletion mutants 50%-70% of total pilus antigen was found free of the cells. We present evidence showing coregulation of papH and the adjacent gene, papA, which encodes the major pilin subunit. A decrease in the PapA to PapH ratio resulted in a large fraction of cells producing shortened pili, whereas overproduction of PapA relative to PapH resulted in cells with lengthened pili. The data show that PapH has roles in anchoring the pilus to the cell and in modulating pilus length."
https://openalex.org/W1999731487,"The Drosophila sevenless mutation results in lack of a single neuron (photoreceptor cell R7) in every ommatidium of the compound eye; the developmental defect occurs in the larval eye disc. We created P-element-induced alleles and used them to isolate the sev gene. An 8.2 kb transcript is expressed in the eye disc, behind the morphogenetic furrow, coincident with recruitment and differentiation of photoreceptor clusters. The transcript becomes localized at the apical surface, persists in the prepupa, and fades out at pupation. It is again detected in the adult head. In some alleles the 8.2 kb transcript is absent. In others, the transcript is expressed, in spite of the absence of cell R7. Localization of the gene product in the eye disc was obtained with antibody raised against sev protein."

https://openalex.org/W1964785867,"To determine if human XX maleness results from an abnormal chromosomal X-Y interchange, we studied the inheritance of the paternal pseudoautosomal region in nine patients. Those six patients in whom Y-specific DNA was found (Y(+)) inherited the entire pseudoautosomal region from the paternal Y chromosome and lost that of the paternal X chromosome. Moreover, in three Y(+) cases, we observed the deletion of a paternal Xp locus tightly linked to the pseudoautosomal region. These results definitively show that an abnormal and terminal X-Y interchange during paternal meiosis causes Y(+)XX maleness. In contrast, no abnormal X-Y interchange was observed in any of the three Y(−) cases analyzed, suggesting that maleness can occur in the absence of any Y-specific DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2030766663,"Serum containing antibodies to the human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has been observed at a higher than expected frequency in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in an area endemic for HTLV-I. An attempt was made to determine whether the cells from patients with this leukemia were HTLV-I antigen-committed B cells that had undergone malignant transformation. Cells from two HTLV-I seropositive Jamaican patients with CLL were fused with a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line. The hybridoma cells that resulted from the fusion of CLL cells from patient I.C. produced an immunoglobulin (IgM) that reacted with the p24 gag protein from HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-III (now referred to as HIV), but showed preferential reactivity with HTLV-I. The specific immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (IgM, kappa) in the CLL cell was demonstrated in the hybridoma cell line, indicating that the captured immunoglobulin was from the CLL cells. The IgM secreted by the fusion of CLL cells from patient L.L. reacted only with HTLV-I-infected cells and with the HTLV-I large envelope protein (gp61) on Western blots. The CLL cells from these patients appear to be a malignant transformation of an antigen-committed B cell responding to HTLV-I infection, suggesting an indirect role for this retrovirus in leukemogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1485523393,"The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase is a cytosolic enzyme that specifically phosphorylates the agonist-occupied form of the beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR). Beta AR kinase appears to be translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane when kin- S49 lymphoma cells are incubated with either beta-adrenergic agonists or prostaglandin E1, both of which act through receptors which stimulate adenylate cyclase. We report here that brief (approximately 20 min) exposure of wild type S49 lymphoma cells to somatostatin (which inhibits adenylate cyclase) promotes the translocation of beta AR kinase to an extent comparable to that observed in the presence of the beta agonist isoproterenol or prostaglandin E1. Beta AR kinase activity can be measured using either beta AR or rhodopsin, the retinal receptor for light, as a substrate. The translocation process triggered by somatostatin is rapid, reversible, and is associated with somatostatin receptor desensitization. The latter is apparent as an attenuation of the inhibition by somatostatin of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of S49 cells preincubated in the presence of the peptide. These results strongly suggest that beta AR kinase is able to phosphorylate and desensitize both stimulatory and inhibitory adenylate cyclase-coupled receptors, thus emerging as a general kinase that regulates the function of different receptors in an agonist-specific fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2037902838,"The viscosity of F-actin and microtubule suspensions has been measured as a function of shear rate with a Weissenberg rheogoniometer. At shear rates of less than 1.0 per second the viscosity of suspensions of these two structural proteins is inversely proportional to shear rate. These results are consistent with previous in vivo measurements of the viscosity of cytoplasm. This power law implies that shear stress is independent of shear rate; that is, shear stress is a constant at all shear rates less than 1.0 per second. Thus the flow profile of these fluids is indeterminate, or nearly so. This flow property may explain several aspects of intracellular motility in living cells. Possible explanations for this flow property are based on a recent model for semidilute suspensions of rigid rods or a classical friction model for liquid crystals."
https://openalex.org/W1488014323,"Abstract Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate six mutant strains of Escherichia coli which had the following specific amino acid substitutions in the beta-subunit of F1-ATPase: (i) Lys-155----Gln; (ii) Lys-155----Glu; (iii) Gly-149----Ile; (iv) Gly-154----Ile; (v) Tyr-297----Phe;(vi) Tyr-354----Phe. The effects of each mutation on growth of cells on succinate plates or limiting (3 mM) glucose and on cell membrane ATPase activity and ATP-driven pH gradient formation were studied. The results showed Lys-155 to be essential for catalysis, as has been predicted previously from sequence homology and structural considerations; however, the results appear to contradict the hypothesis that Lys-155 interacts with one of the substrate phosphate groups because the Lys-155----Glu mutation was less detrimental than Lys-155----Gln. Gly-149 and Gly-154 have been predicted to be involved in essential conformational changes in F1-ATPase by virtue of their position in a putative glycine-rich flexible loop structure. The mutation of Gly-154----Ile caused strong impairment of catalysis, but the Gly-149----Ile mutation produced only moderate impairment. The two tyrosine residues chosen for mutation were residues which have previously received much attention due to their being the sites of reaction of the inactivating chemical modification reagents 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (Tyr-297) and p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-5'-adenosine (Tyr-354). We found that mutation of Tyr-297----Phe caused only minor impairment of catalysis, and mutation of Tyr-354----Phe produced no impairment. Therefore, a direct role for either of these tyrosine residues in catalysis is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2092128849,"In contrast to uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), CEFs infected with a retroviral vector that carries the v-erbA gene of avian erythroblastosis virus displayed new properties. These included limited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, growth without latency in serum-supplemented medium, ability to overcome quiescence induced by serum deprivation, growth at low cell density, and an extended life span in vitro. Furthermore, when explanted in vivo onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryo, the transformed CEFs expressing v-erbA in addition to v-erbB exhibited a high proliferative rate, giving rise to fibrosarcoma tumors that were ten times larger than those developed from transformed CEFs expressing v-erbB alone. All these data show that CEFs expressing the v-erbA oncogene display activated growth and suggest that the v-erbA product interferes with the mechanisms regulating the growth and/or differentiation of primary CEFs."
https://openalex.org/W1570075490,"We have previously found that preprosomatostatin is processed accurately to both somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 in pituitary gonadotrophs of transgenic mice. The foreign somatostatin peptides have been shown to enter the regulated secretory pathway of these cells. To determine whether accurate preprosomatostatin processing can occur in any neuroendocrine cell, we introduced preprosomatostatin cDNA expression vectors into several different neuroendocrine cell lines. We found that prosomatostatin was cleaved efficiently to somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 in RIN 5F and AtT20 cells, but not in GH4 or PC12 cells. The ability of a particular cell type to process prosomatostatin did not correlate with cellular storage capacity and was independent of the level of biosynthesis of the precursor. These data suggest that prosomatostatin processing requires specific pathways which are present in some neuroendocrine cells, but not in others."
https://openalex.org/W2171680307,"Good evidence exists to indicate that the vasodilating effect of adenosine is mediated by cell surface receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells. The mechanism of transmembrane signal transduction for adenosine, however, is not fully understood. Since cGMP is a second messenger known to mediate vasodilation, I have examined the effect of adenosine on the intracellular concentration of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta. I found that adenosine at 10(-9) to 10(-5) M led to an increase in intracellular cGMP levels in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect of adenosine on cyclic guanosine inorganic monophosphate (cGMP) could be mimicked by the A-type receptor agonists N6-cyclohexyladenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine and was attenuated by the A-receptor antagonist theophylline. The order of potency of the adenosine analogues was N6-cyclohexyladenosine greater than 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine greater than adenosine. These findings suggest that the effect of adenosine on cGMPi is mediated by A1-type cell surface receptors. Concerning the mechanism by which adenosine could elevate cGMPi, I found that the effect of adenosine on cGMPi was potentiated by the cGMP phosphodiesterase-specific inhibitor M & B 22948. Moreover, I found that N6-cyclohexyladenosine, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, and adenosine stimulated a guanylate cyclase in homogenates of the cultured smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent fashion with the same order of potency as their effects on cGMPi. Further evidence was obtained to indicate that adenosine and its analogues stimulated a particulate guanylate cyclase activity, whereas they did not alter soluble guanylate cyclase activity. Since cGMP is known as a second messenger mediating relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells, the results obtained in this study could suggest that adenosine exerts its vasorelaxing effect by activating an Ai-receptor-linked guanylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1503798695,"The regulation of cytoplasmic pH (pHi) was examined in neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cell-line cells (NG108-15 cells) using 2,7-biscarboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. The pHi of NG108-15 cells suspended in nominally HCO-3-free, Na+-containing buffer could be reduced by the external application of acetate. The recovery of pHi to its resting value was blocked by the removal of extracellular Na+, by the addition of extra-cellular H+, and by the addition of analogs of amiloride selective for inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange. The rate of recovery of pHi from acid load exhibited an ionic selectivity of Na+ greater than Li+ much greater than K+, and no recovery was observed in N-methyl-D-glucamine+. Tetrodotoxin and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid had no effect on early pHi recovery. These data suggest that Na+/H+ exchange accounts primarily for the recovery of pHi in NG108-15 cells under our experimental conditions. Na+/H+ exchange in NG108-15 cells was accelerated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Thus, (-)epinephrine, but not (+)epinephrine, elicited an intracellular alkalinization which was blocked by the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist yohimbine but not by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, nor the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Norepinephrine, clonidine, and the clonidine analog, UK-14304, also caused alkalinization of NG108-15 cells, whereas isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, and phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist, did not. Manipulations that blocked Na+/H+ exchange blocked the ability of alpha 2-adrenergic agonists to alkalinize the interior of NG108-15 cells without blocking the ability of these agonists to attenuate cAMP accumulation. These findings provide the first direct evidence of modulation of Na+/H+ exchange activity by a receptor linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and offer a possible mechanism whereby alpha 2-adrenergic receptors might influence cellular activity apart from changes in cyclic nucleotide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2050066302,"We describe the effect of exogenous tubulin on reactivation of anaphase spindle elongation in isolated diatom spindies. In the absence of tubulin, spindle elongation is limited to the equivalent of the microtubule overlap zone, but in the presence of tubulin spindle elongation is several times the length of the overlap zone. Biotinylated neurotubulin is incorporated into the overlap zone and around the poles. Before spindles have elongated by the equivalent of the overlap zone, there are two regions of incorporated tubulin flanking this zone. After further elongation, there is one broad zone of incorporated tubulin in the spindle midzone. Spindle elongation and the pattern of tubulin incorporation into the midzone, but not the poles, are ATP-dependent and vanadate-sensitive. These results suggest that tubulin adds onto the ends of microtubules in the overlap zone, which then slide through the midzone as the spindle elongates."
https://openalex.org/W1511292930,"The purified tonoplast H+-ATPase from oat roots (Avena sativa L. var. Lang) consists of at least three different polypeptides with masses 72, 60, and 16 kDa. We have used covalent modifiers (inhibitors) and polyclonal antibodies to identify the catalytic subunit of the H+-pumping ATPase. The inactivation of ATPase activity by 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (Nbd-Cl, an adenine analog) was protected by MgATP or MgADP, and showed kinetic properties consistent with active site-directed inhibition. Under similar conditions, [14C]Nbd-Cl preferentially labeled the 72-kDa polypeptide of the purified ATPase. This binding was reduced by MgATP or 2' (3')-)O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) ATP. Nbd-Cl probably modified cysteinyl--SH or tyrosyl--OH groups, as dithiothreitol reversed both ATPase inactivation and [14C]Nbd-Cl binding to the 72-kDa subunit. The finding that N-ethylmaleimide inhibition of ATPase activity was protectable by nucleotides is consistent with the idea of sulfhydryl groups in the ATP-binding site. Polyclonal antibody made to the 72-kDa polypeptide specifically reacted (Western blot) with a 72-kDa polypeptide from both tonoplast-enriched membranes and the purified tonoplast ATPase, but it did not cross-react with the mitochondrial or Escherichia coli F1-ATPase. The antibody inhibited tonoplast ATPase and H+-pumping activities. We conclude from these results that the 72-kDa polypeptide of the tonoplast H+-ATPase contains an ATP- (or nucleotide-) binding site that may constitute the catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1538608251,"The Thy-1 antigen of the surface of lymphocytes and neurons is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycophospholipid moiety. In contrast, the Thy-1 synthesized by the class E Thy-1 negative mutant lymphoma is secreted as a hydrophilic species. The present investigation uses the approach of biosynthetic labeling to investigate further the structure of the intracellular Thy-1 of wild-type cells and the secreted Thy-1 of these mutant cells. In the wild-type cells, Thy-1 can be labeled with [3H] mannose, [3H]galactose, [3H]fucose, [3H]ethanolamine, and [3H]palmitic acid. In the latter two cases the label is recovered almost exclusively in a detergent-binding Pronase fragment of the protein. The incorporated label is in the form of [3H]ethanolamine, or [3H]palmitate and stearate, respectively. Reductive methylation of biosynthetically labeled Thy-1 and a nonradioactive sample of Thy-1 shows that [3H]ethanolamine is incorporated equally into two residues of ethanolamine, only one of which has a free amino group. A single residue of glucosamine with a free amino group is also detected. Each of the sugar precursors is incorporated with extensive conservation of chemical identity. In the class E cells, each of the labeled sugars but neither [3H]ethanolamine nor [3H]palmitate is incorporated into Thy-1. The anchor moiety therefore appears to be entirely missing, although N-linked oligosaccharide processing is essentially normal. We postulate that the anchor deficiency in the mutant cells results from a biosynthetic lesion."
https://openalex.org/W1595947986,"F1-stripped everted membrane vesicles of the ATP synthase-overproducing Escherichia coli strain KY 7485 were treated with trypsin for different lengths of time. Subsequently, the Fo complex was isolated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, as well as immunoblotting using antibodies raised against subunit b. By these techniques 3 degradation products with apparent molecular masses of about 16 kDa could be detected in accordance with previous findings (Perlin, D.S., and Senior, A.E. (1985) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 236, 603-611). Labeling of isolated trypsin-treated Fo fractions with the thiol-specific reagent N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarinyl)-maleimide, which has been demonstrated recently to specifically modify subunit b (Schneider, E., and Altendorf, K. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 153, 105-109) revealed that the 16-kDa digestion products were degraded into two stable fragments of 12 and 8.3 kDa. These polypeptides do not react with the anti-b antibodies. Treatment of purified liposome-integrated Fo with trypsin resulted in a similar cleavage pattern. In both cases protease digestion inhibited F1 binding while proton-translocating activity remained unaffected. However, liposomes reconstituted with Fo isolated from trypsin-treated membranes were impaired in both binding of F1 and proton translocation. These activities could be restored when reconstitution was carried out in the presence of native subunit b. From this we conclude that the C-terminal region of subunit b is necessary for proper reconstitution of Fo into liposomes."

Two regulatory molecules were found to be bound to the promoter only when the gene was induced. The binding sites for these factors mapped to regions located at -100 to -108 and -186 to -190 relative to the site of transcript initiation. Two additional regulatory molecules were bound to sites located at positions -117 to -120 and -138 to -145 regardless of the state of transcription. However, the factor bound at the -138 to -145 region was found to alter its binding characteristics when the gene was induced."

The concentrations of AP3-PL and AP4-PL for half-maximal inactivations of the multisite (steady state) ATPase activity were both 18 microM. The binding of these reagents to a reactive lysyl residue(s) was confirmed from the difference absorption spectra, and the stoichiometry of binding of [3H]AP3-PL to F1 at the saturating level was about 1 mol/mol F1. The analogue bound to both the alpha subunit (about two-thirds of the radioactivity) and the beta subunit (about one-third of the radioactivity). No inactivation of multisite ATPase activity or binding of AP3-PL was observed in the presence of ATP. F1 modified with about one mol of AP3-PL had essentially no uni- and multisite hydrolysis of ATP. The rate of binding of ATP decreased to 10(-2) of that of unmodified F1, and the rate of release of ATP was about two times faster. The equilibrium F1 X ATP in equilibrium F1 X ADP X Pi was shifted toward F1 X ATP, and no promotion of ATP hydrolysis at unisite was observed with excess ATP. These results suggest that the AP3-PL or AP4-PL bound to an active site, and catalysis by the two remaining sites was completely abolished."
https://openalex.org/W1606410597,"Mild trypsin proteolysis of the H+-ATPase from yeast plasma membranes has been used to identify structurally distinct catalytic intermediates. In the absence of substrate, trypsin treatment resulted in rapid inactivation of enzyme activity. By contrast, trypsin treatment of enzyme in the presence of MgATP or MgATP plus vanadate resulted in enhanced rates of ATP hydrolysis accompanied by protection from extensive inactivation. High concentrations of Pi also induced strong protection from trypsin-induced inactivation, although enhancement of enzyme activity was not observed. Western blot analysis of peptide fragment profiles following tryptic digestion indicated that at least 15 prominent fragments of identical size, ranging from Mr = 12,800 to 48,000, were generated irrespective of digestion conditions. However, fragments from protected enzyme were resistant to further proteolysis, whereas fragments from unprotected enzyme were extensively degraded. These data have been interpreted in terms of a published catalytic reaction pathway (Amory, A., Goffeau, A., McIntosh, D.B., and Boyer, P.D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12509-12516) and are consistent with unprotected and protected enzyme conformations representing E1 and E2 X Pi catalytic intermediates, respectively. Trypsin proteolysis proved an effective tool for evaluating preferred enzyme conformational states and with this approach, it was found that ATPase inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide and fluorescein isothiocyanate locked the enzyme in an E1 conformation. The enhanced rate of ATP hydrolysis by trypsin-treated enzyme was fully coupled to proton transport, and all fragments generated by proteolysis were firmly bound to the membrane. These results, coupled with the fact that initial peptide fragmentation profiles were independent of enzyme conformation, suggest that the different conformational states, E1, and E2 X Pi, are not related to gross changes in overall enzyme structure but likely reflect localized changes in intramolecular bonding."
https://openalex.org/W1483427384,"Tabtoxinine-beta-lactam, an irreversible inhibitor of glutamine synthetase is produced by several pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae. We have examined tabtoxinine-beta-lactam biosynthesis, an important and poorly characterized step in pathogenesis caused by this organism. We have identified the biosynthetic precursors of tabtoxinine-beta-lactam by incorporating 13C from specifically 13C-labeled D-glucose precursors and determining the labeling pattern using 13C NMR spectroscopy. Tabtoxinine-beta-lactam is generated by combining a 4-carbon fragment, a 2-carbon fragment, and a single carbon. The 4-carbon fragment arises from aspartic acid, and the 2-carbon unit is donated from carbons 2 and 3 of pyruvate. The 6-carbon backbone of tabtoxinine-beta-lactam arises from the condensation of fragments from aspartate and pyruvate, probably using reactions analogous to the initial steps in the pathway of lysine biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1539155563,"Many bioactive peptides are initially synthesized via larger precursors from which they are released by proteolytic cleavage at basic amino acids. Some precursors contain more than one final product peptide, multiple copies of a single peptide, or both. Different product peptides can be produced from a common precursor in different tissues. It is not currently known whether this cell-type specific production of bioactive peptides is mediated by different, specific propeptide converting enzymes (PCEs) or by a small number of similar PCEs. To resolve this issue for the conversion of prosomatostatin, the processing of prosomatostatin-I (aPSS-I) and prosomatostatin-II (aPSS-II) to either somatostatin-14 (SS-14) or somatostatin-28 (aSS-28), respectively, was examined in anglerfish islets. Two distinct forms of PSS PCE activity were detected using a rapid, sensitive, and specific assay. Examination of the specificity of these two enzyme activities showed that one proteolytic activity performs the aPSS-I to SS-14 conversion, while the other protease liberates aSS-28 from aPSS-II. The SS-14-generating PCE also cleaves aPSS-II to produce [Tyr7,Gly10]SS-14 (a tetra-decapeptide analog of SS-14) and converts proinsulin to insulin. The aSS-28-generating PCE does not process proinsulin. These results provide direct evidence that different, specific PCEs are required for liberation of SS-14 and aSS-28 from their precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1482916548,"The proton pump (H+-ATPase) found in the plasma membrane of the fungus Neurospora crassa is inactivated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). Kinetic and labeling experiments have suggested that inactivation at 0 degrees C results from the covalent attachment of DCCD to a single site in the Mr = 100,000 catalytic subunit (Sussman, M. R., and Slayman, C. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1839-1843). In the present study, when [14C]DCCD-labeled enzyme was treated with the cleavage reagent, N-bromosuccinimide, a single major radioactive peptide fragment migrating at about Mr = 5,300 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was produced. The fragment was coupled to glass beads and partially sequenced by automated solid-phase Edman degradation at the amino terminus and at an internal tryptic cleavage site. By comparison to the DNA-derived amino acid sequence for the entire Mr = 100,000 polypeptide (Hager, K., and Slayman, C. W. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 7693-7697), the fragment has been identified as arising by cleavage at tyrosine 100 and tryptophan 141. Covalently incorporated [14C]DCCD was released at a position corresponding to glutamate 129. The DCCD-reactive glutamate is located in the middle of the first of eight predicted transmembrane sequences. When the sequence surrounding the DCCD site is compared to that surrounding the DCCD-reactive residue of two other proton pumps, the F0F1-ATPase and cytochrome c oxidase, no homology is apparent apart from an abundance of hydrophobic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1492534088,"Tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, was previously shown to be phosphorylated on four distinct serine residues in PC12 cell cultures, each one being specific for the kinase system involved (McTigue, M., Cremins, J., and Halegoua, S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9047-9056). A cAMP- and Ca2+-independent protein kinase was found to be associated with tyrosine hydroxylase purified from rat pheochromocytoma tumor. The use of this activity and the availability of a large amount of purified tyrosine hydroxylase allowed identification of the site phosphorylated by this kinase activity. A peptide of 1.5 kDa (about 12 residues long), carrying the phosphorylation site, was released from 32P-labeled tyrosine hydroxylase by limited proteolysis with trypsin. This peptide was isolated from trypsinized tyrosine hydroxylase by sequential gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies. Analysis by thin layer chromatography of an acid hydrolysate of the peptide revealed that it contained phosphoserine. The sequence determination of the peptide showed that it corresponded to the residues 38-45 in the tyrosine hydroxylase primary structure (Arg-Gln-Ser(P)-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala). Thus, the associated kinase phosphorylated Ser-40, one of the phosphorylation sites for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase also found in rat pheochromocytoma tumors. These results are compared to those recently appearing in a report by Campbell et al. (Campbell, D. G., Hardie, D. G., and Vulliet, P. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10489-10492)."
https://openalex.org/W1514759229,"The interaction of soluble tyrosine hydroxylase with isolated chromaffin granule membranes was studied. The incubation of the granule membranes with the soluble fraction in the mixture that may approximate the intracellular environment of the resting cell resulted in a marked increase in the enzyme activity recovered in the membrane fraction, and enzyme activity precipitated with the granule membranes was increased according to incubation time and dependent on amounts of both the granule membranes and soluble fraction. The association of the soluble enzyme with the granule membranes was reversible and specific, whereas a decrease in activity of the soluble enzyme was observed when the soluble fraction was incubated with the granule membranes in the mixture in which association of the soluble enzyme with the granule membranes might occur. These results seem to indicate that activity of the soluble enzyme is presumably modulated by the granule through association of the soluble enzyme with the surface of the granule, thus suggesting that interaction between tyrosine hydroxylase and the chromaffin granule may play a possible role in regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis as a consequence of modulating activity of the rate-limiting enzyme within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1598333910,"The compound P1-(5'-adenosyl)-P2-N-(2-mercaptoethyl)diphosphoramidate (AMEDA) was synthesized as an ATP analogue for in situ reaction with the 4-nitro-2,1,3-[14C]benzoxadiazolyl group (NBD) in the labeled F1-ATPase (F1). AMEDA was found to reactivate O-[14C]NBD-F1 via a dual-path mechanism. The principal path involves the binding of AMEDA at a site in F1 with Kd = 14.5 microM and subsequent reaction with the [14C]NBD label. The second slower path involves the direct biomolecular reaction of AMEDA with the radioactive label on F1. The rate of reactivation of O-[14C]NBD-F1 by AMEDA was decreased by ADP or ATP which competes with the ATP analogue for binding to the labeled enzyme. The reaction product was found to contain one adenine group, two phosphate groups, and one [14C]NBD label per molecule as expected from the structure of the compound AMEDA-[14C]NBD. Purified AMEDA-[14C]NBD was found to bind to unlabeled F1 with Kd = 2 microM. These observations demonstrate the in situ reaction of bound AMEDA with the nearby [14C]NBD label attached to Tyr-beta 311 and support the assumed presence of Tyr-beta 311 near the phosphate groups of ATP bound at the hydrolytic site of F1-ATPase. The possible locations of Tyr-beta 364, His-beta 427, and Tyr-beta 345 relative to Tyr-beta 311 in F1 are discussed, and the validity of the previously proposed model for F1-ATPase with one hydrolytic site assisted by two auxiliary sites is examined and compared with that of the widely accepted alternating sites model."
