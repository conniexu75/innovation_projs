https://openalex.org/W2165067288,"The immune system responds to pathogens by a variety of pattern recognition molecules such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which promote recognition of dangerous foreign pathogens. However, recent evidence indicates that normal intestinal microbiota might also positively influence immune responses, and protect against the development of inflammatory diseases. One of these elements may be short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are produced by fermentation of dietary fibre by intestinal microbiota. A feature of human ulcerative colitis and other colitic diseases is a change in 'healthy' microbiota such as Bifidobacterium and Bacteriodes, and a concurrent reduction in SCFAs. Moreover, increased intake of fermentable dietary fibre, or SCFAs, seems to be clinically beneficial in the treatment of colitis. SCFAs bind the G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43, also known as FFAR2), and here we show that SCFA-GPR43 interactions profoundly affect inflammatory responses. Stimulation of GPR43 by SCFAs was necessary for the normal resolution of certain inflammatory responses, because GPR43-deficient (Gpr43(-/-)) mice showed exacerbated or unresolving inflammation in models of colitis, arthritis and asthma. This seemed to relate to increased production of inflammatory mediators by Gpr43(-/-) immune cells, and increased immune cell recruitment. Germ-free mice, which are devoid of bacteria and express little or no SCFAs, showed a similar dysregulation of certain inflammatory responses. GPR43 binding of SCFAs potentially provides a molecular link between diet, gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism, and immune and inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2012627860,"The recognition of specific DNA sequences by proteins is thought to depend on two types of mechanism: one that involves the formation of hydrogen bonds with specific bases, primarily in the major groove, and one involving sequence-dependent deformations of the DNA helix. By comprehensively analysing the three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes, here we show that the binding of arginine residues to narrow minor grooves is a widely used mode for protein-DNA recognition. This readout mechanism exploits the phenomenon that narrow minor grooves strongly enhance the negative electrostatic potential of the DNA. The nucleosome core particle offers a prominent example of this effect. Minor-groove narrowing is often associated with the presence of A-tracts, AT-rich sequences that exclude the flexible TpA step. These findings indicate that the ability to detect local variations in DNA shape and electrostatic potential is a general mechanism that enables proteins to use information in the minor groove, which otherwise offers few opportunities for the formation of base-specific hydrogen bonds, to achieve DNA-binding specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1974226247,"A growing body of evidence indicates that resolution of acute inflammation is an active process. Resolvins are a new family of lipid mediators enzymatically generated within resolution networks that possess unique and specific functions to orchestrate catabasis, the phase in which disease declines. Resolvin D2 (RvD2) was originally identified in resolving exudates, yet its individual contribution in resolution remained to be elucidated. Here, we establish RvD2's potent stereoselective actions in reducing excessive neutrophil trafficking to inflammatory loci. RvD2 decreased leukocyte-endothelial interactions in vivo by endothelial-dependent nitric oxide production, and by direct modulation of leukocyte adhesion receptor expression. In mice with microbial sepsis initiated by caecal ligation and puncture, RvD2 sharply decreased both local and systemic bacterial burden, excessive cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment, while increasing peritoneal mononuclear cells and macrophage phagocytosis. These multi-level pro-resolving actions of RvD2 translate to increased survival from sepsis induced by caecal ligation and puncture and surgery. Together, these results identify RvD2 as a potent endogenous regulator of excessive inflammatory responses that acts via multiple cellular targets to stimulate resolution and preserve immune vigilance."
https://openalex.org/W2103267716,"Two groups present redshift determinations and other spectroscopic data for the γ-ray burst GRB 090423 — now the earliest and most distant astronomical object known. Salvaterra et al. report its initial detection with the Swift satellite on 23 April 2009, and a redshift determination with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on La Palma 14 hours after the burst, obtaining z ≈ 8.1. Tanvir et al. used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, Hawaii, from about 20 minutes after the burst and arrive at z ≈ 8.2. The previous highest redshift known for any object was z = 6.96 for a Lyman-α emitting galaxy. These measurements imply that massive stars were being produced and were dying as γ-ray bursts as early as about 600 million years after the Big Bang, and that their properties are very similar to those stars producing γ-ray bursts 10 billion years later. Long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs), thought to result from the explosions of certain massive stars, are bright enough that some of them should be observable out to redshifts of z > 20. So far, the highest redshift measured for any object has been z = 6.96, for a Lyman-α emitting galaxy. Here, and in an accompanying paper, GRB 090423 is reported to lie at a redshift of z ≈ 8.2, implying that massive stars were being produced and dying as GRBs approximately 620 million years after the Big Bang. Long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to result from the explosions of certain massive stars1, and some are bright enough that they should be observable out to redshifts of z > 20 using current technology2,3,4. Hitherto, the highest redshift measured for any object was z = 6.96, for a Lyman-α emitting galaxy5. Here we report that GRB 090423 lies at a redshift of z ≈ 8.2, implying that massive stars were being produced and dying as GRBs ∼630 Myr after the Big Bang. The burst also pinpoints the location of its host galaxy."
https://openalex.org/W1986842102,"A cornerstone of Einstein's special relativity is Lorentz invariance-the postulate that all observers measure exactly the same speed of light in vacuum, independent of photon-energy. While special relativity assumes that there is no fundamental length-scale associated with such invariance, there is a fundamental scale (the Planck scale, l(Planck) approximately 1.62 x 10(-33) cm or E(Planck) = M(Planck)c(2) approximately 1.22 x 10(19) GeV), at which quantum effects are expected to strongly affect the nature of space-time. There is great interest in the (not yet validated) idea that Lorentz invariance might break near the Planck scale. A key test of such violation of Lorentz invariance is a possible variation of photon speed with energy. Even a tiny variation in photon speed, when accumulated over cosmological light-travel times, may be revealed by observing sharp features in gamma-ray burst (GRB) light-curves. Here we report the detection of emission up to approximately 31 GeV from the distant and short GRB 090510. We find no evidence for the violation of Lorentz invariance, and place a lower limit of 1.2E(Planck) on the scale of a linear energy dependence (or an inverse wavelength dependence), subject to reasonable assumptions about the emission (equivalently we have an upper limit of l(Planck)/1.2 on the length scale of the effect). Our results disfavour quantum-gravity theories in which the quantum nature of space-time on a very small scale linearly alters the speed of light."
https://openalex.org/W2031416354,"Defects in germ-cell (oocyte and sperm) development are a leading cause of infertility in men and women. Several studies have shown that germ cells can be differentiated from mouse and human embryonic stem cells, but human germ cells produced in this way generally fail to develop beyond the earliest stages and do not enter meiosis. Now a team from Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine has developed a system in which primordial germ cells can be derived from both male and female human embryonic stem cells. By silencing and overexpressing germ-cell-specific genes, human germ-cell formation and developmental progression can be modulated. Specifically, the human DAZL gene, which is implicated in infertility, is shown to function in primordial germ-cell formation, whereas closely related family members, DAZ and BOULE, modulate later stages of meiosis and development of haploid male gametes. This system can be used to study germ-cell defects and the potential to correct them therapeutically. Defects in human germ-cell (oocyte and sperm) development are the leading cause of infertility in men and women. A germ-cell reporter is now used to quantify and isolate primordial germ cells derived from both male and female human embryonic stem cells. Human DAZL is observed to function in primordial germ-cell formation, whereas the closely related genes DAZ and BOULE promote later stages of meiosis and development of gametes. The leading cause of infertility in men and women is quantitative and qualitative defects in human germ-cell (oocyte and sperm) development. Yet, it has not been possible to examine the unique developmental genetics of human germ-cell formation and differentiation owing to inaccessibility of germ cells during fetal development. Although several studies have shown that germ cells can be differentiated from mouse and human embryonic stem cells, human germ cells differentiated in these studies generally did not develop beyond the earliest stages1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we used a germ-cell reporter to quantify and isolate primordial germ cells derived from both male and female human embryonic stem cells. By silencing and overexpressing genes that encode germ-cell-specific cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins (not transcription factors), we modulated human germ-cell formation and developmental progression. We observed that human DAZL (deleted in azoospermia-like) functions in primordial germ-cell formation, whereas closely related genes DAZ and BOULE (also called BOLL) promote later stages of meiosis and development of haploid gametes. These results are significant to the generation of gametes for future basic science and potential clinical applications."

Although dynein, Lis1, and other cytoplasmic proteins are known for their roles in connecting microtubules to the nucleus during interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) and nucleokinesis, the factors connecting dynein/Lis1 to the nuclear envelope (NE) remain to be determined. We report here that the SUN-domain proteins SUN1 and SUN2 and the KASH-domain proteins Syne-1/Nesprin-1 and Syne-2/Nesprin-2 play critical roles in neurogenesis and neuronal migration in mice. We show that SUN1 and SUN2 redundantly form complexes with Syne-2 to mediate the centrosome-nucleus coupling during both INM and radial neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. Syne-2 is connected to the centrosome through interactions with both dynein/dynactin and kinesin complexes. Syne-2 mutants also display severe defects in learning and memory. These results fill an important gap in our understanding of the mechanism of nuclear movement during brain development.

These results fill an important gap in our understanding of the mechanism of nuclear movement during brain development. Neuronal migration is a fundamental process for the development of laminary structures in the mammalian brain, including the cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and hindbrain. Defects in neuronal migration are responsible for human diseases such as lissencephaly and double-cortex syndromes. In the cerebral cortex, most neurons are born in the germinal zone along the lateral ventricles and migrate toward the pial surface in an inside-out fashion. Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) and nucleokinesis are two distinct processes in which the nucleus undergoes dramatic movement, which is necessary for proper brain development (Feng and Walsh, 2001Feng Y.

Lissencephaly and LIS1: insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal migration and development.Clin. Genet. 2007; 72: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). INM refers to the nuclear movement of neural epithelial stem cells (NESCs) and radial glial progenitor cells (RGPCs). From embryonic day (E) 8 to E11, the nuclei of NESCs migrate between the apical and basal surfaces of the neural epithelium in conjunction with the progression of the cell cycle. When neurogenesis begins at E11, the NESCs differentiate into RGPCs, and their nuclei continue to move within the ventricular zone (VZ). Nucleokinesis describes the nuclear movement during cell migration. After the transition of young neurons from multipolar to bipolar shape in the subventricular zone (SVZ), they migrate along the radial glial fibers across a long distance toward the pial surface. These projection neurons reiterate a four-step process during radial migration. First, the leading edge of the neuron extends along the radial glial fiber, and a swelling of the plasma membrane forms in the leading process. The microtubule network is then pulled forward, and the centrosome moves steadily into the swelling. Next, the nucleus is pulled by microtubules toward the centrosome. Finally, the trailing cytoplasmic region follows the nucleus and finishes soma translocation (Tsai et al., 2007Tsai J.W. Bremner K.H. Vallee R.B.

How the large nucleus moves during INM and nucleokinesis remains an important and fascinating question. Microtubules have been shown to exert pulling forces during granule cell migration in the cerebellum and radial neuronal migration in the cortex (Keays et al., 2007Keays D.A. Tian G. Poirier K.

In the prevailing model, one group of cytoplasmic dynein proteins is anchored on the plasma membrane and pulls the microtubule and centrosome forward, while another group of cytoplasmic dynein proteins is anchored on the nuclear envelope (NE) by some unknown factors and transmits the force to the nucleus (Morris, 2003Morris N.R.

During INM, the centrosome is maintained along the apical surface, and the nucleus moves up and down (Higginbotham and Gleeson, 2007Higginbotham H.R. Gleeson J.G.

Lis1 is also required for the symmetric division of murine NESCs and RGPCs, where it attaches the microtubule plus end to the cell cortex (Yingling et al., 2008Yingling J. Youn Y.H. Darling D.

These findings suggest that the protein complexes utilized in nucleokinesis are also critical for INM. However, in both cases, the essential link between cytoplasmic dynein and the NE is still undetermined.

Consistent with this notion, human SYNE1 has been shown to be associated with cerebellar ataxia in a French-Canadian cohort (Gros-Louis et al., 2007Gros-Louis F. Dupre N. Dion P. Fox M.A. Laurent S. Verreault S. Sanes J.R. Bouchard J.P. Rouleau G.A. Mutations in SYNE1 lead to a newly discovered form of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia.Nat.

In this study, we have examined the central nervous system in Syne-1/2 DKD and Sun1/2 DKO mutants and have uncovered the critical functions of these proteins in nucleokinesis and INM during mammalian brain development. Our results indicate that the SUN-KASH complexes mediate the coupling between the nucleus and the centrosome and provide anchors in the NE for cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin during neuronal migration. Sun1/2 DKO (Sun1−/−; Sun2−/−) pups failed to breathe and died shortly after birth (Lei et al., 2009Lei K. Zhang X. Ding X. Guo X. Chen M. Zhu B. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Xu R. Han M.

Necropsy showed that their brain size was significantly reduced compared with that of their littermate controls (Figure 1A; data not shown). Histological analysis of the brains of E18.5 Sun1/2 DKO embryo indicated severe defects, including malformed cortices, enlarged lateral ventricles, and a smaller corpus callosum (Figure 1B; data not shown). Multiple brain regions of the DKO pups displayed severe laminary defects, including loss of the mitral cell layer in the olfactory bulb, loss of the pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus, loss of the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum, and widespread defects in the midbrain and hindbrain (Figures 1C–1H). The cerebral cortex is organized in six layers that were clearly observable in the cortex of Sun1+/−; Sun2−/− mice (Figure 1D). In contrast, the six-layer structure could not be distinguished in the cortex of Sun1/2 DKO mice (Figure 1D). Noticeably, the cell density in the region above the VZ was abnormally high, likely because of the failure of radial neuronal migration. Immunostaining with an antibody recognizing the neuronal-specific protein NeuN showed a reduced number of neurons and a poorly developed subplate in the Sun1/2 DKO cortex (Figure 1I). We further examined the laminary structure using an anti-Cux1 antibody that is specific for neurons in the later-born layers 2 and 3, and an anti-Tbr-1 antibody that is specific for neurons in the early-born layer 6 and the subplate (Molyneaux et al., 2007Molyneaux B.J. Arlotta P. Menezes J.R. Macklis J.D. Neuronal subtype specification in the cerebral cortex.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Although Cux1- and Tbr1-positive neurons were readily detectible in Sun1/2 DKO cortices, the positions they occupied, referring to the distance from the pial surface, were inverted compared with that in the Sun1+/−; Sun2−/− controls (Figures 1J and 1K). To determine whether the marginal zone was properly developed in the Sun1/2 DKO mutants, we examined the cerebral cortices of E15.5 embryos with an anti-Reelin antibody. Reelin-positive neurons were localized beneath the pial surface in the Sun1+/−; Sun2−/− controls (Figures S1A–S1D available online). In contrast, the number of Reelin-positive cells is significantly increased in Sun1/2 DKO embryo brain, and these cells occupied deeper positions referring to the Tbr1-positive cells (Figures S1E–S1H). These results indicate that the laminary structure of cerebral cortex is inverted in Sun1/2 DKO mice. Syne-1 collaborates with SUN1 and SUN2 for proper myonuclear anchorage in mice (Lei et al., 2009Lei K. Zhang X. Ding X. Guo X. Chen M. Zhu B. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Xu R. Han M. SUN1 and SUN2 play critical but partially redundant roles in anchoring nuclei in skeletal muscle cells in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 10207-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and Syne-1/2 DKD (Syne-1−/−; Syne-2−/−) pups also failed to breathe and died shortly after birth (Zhang et al., 2007Zhang X. Xu R. Zhu B. Yang X. Ding X. Duan S. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Han M. Syne-1 and Syne-2 play crucial roles in myonuclear anchorage and motor neuron innervation.Development. 2007; 134: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We thus examined whether Syne-1 and Syne-2 mutants displayed similar neuronal defects as did Sun1/2 DKO mice. The brains of E18.5 Syne-1/2 DKD (Syne-1−/−; Syne-2−/−) mice were significantly smaller than those of Syne-1+/−; Syne-2+/−, Syne-1−/−; Syne-2+/−, and Syne-1+/−; Syne-2−/− littermates (Figure S2). Syne-1/2 DKD brains displayed enlarged lateral ventricles, inverted layers in the cerebral cortex, loss of the pyramidal cell layer in hippocampus, loss of the Purkinje cell layer in cerebellum, and laminary defects in the midbrain, brain stem, and many other brain regions (Figures 2A–2E and S2). Cux1- and Tbr1-positive cells also occupied inverted position in the cerebral cortex of Syne-1/2 DKD mice (data not shown). Interestingly, brains of E18.5 Syne-1+/−; Syne-2−/− mice displayed inverted layers in the cerebral cortex and abnormal pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus, similar to that seen in Syne-1−/−; Syne-2−/− mice, but had a normal Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum and normal organization of the brain stem (Figures 2A–2E). In adult Syne-1+/−; Syne-2−/− but not in Syne-1−/−; Syne-2+/− mice, the distinct laminary structure of the cerebral cortex was disrupted, and the pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus was mostly abolished (Figures 2F and 2G). In contrast, although the cerebellum was smaller, the Purkinje cells and granule cells occupied correct positions in the Syne-1+/−; Syne-2−/− mice (Figures 2H and 2I). We also examined Syne-1−/− and Syne-2−/− mice and found that the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus of Syne-2−/− brains displayed impaired laminary structures, similar to those seen in the Syne-1+/−; Syne-2−/− mice, but the brains of Syne-1−/− mutants showed no obvious defects (data not shown). These results indicate that Syne-2 alone is essential for the laminary structure formation in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and that Syne-1 and Syne-2 have redundant roles in the cerebellum, midbrain, brain stem, and other brain regions. The inverted laminary structure in the cerebral cortex and severe laminary defects in various brain regions are similar to the defects seen in mice with mutations in the Reelin or Disabled gene (D'Arcangelo et al., 1995D'Arcangelo G.

To investigate the roles of SUN1/2 in neuronal migration, we intercrossed Sun1+/−; Sun2−/−mice with either Sun1+/−; Sun2−/− or Sun1+/− mice, and injected BrdU intraperitoneally into the pregnant mothers at either E12.5 or E14.5. The BrdU-positive cells were examined on coronal sections of E18.5 brains. In the cortex of Sun1+/−; Sun2+/−, Sun1+/−; Sun2−/−, and Sun1−/−; Sun2+/− mice, the E12.5-labeled BrdU-positive cells were located in regions close to the intermediate zone (IZ), whereas the E14.5-labeled cells were close to the pial surface. In contrast, the positions of BrdU-positive cells were inverted in Sun1−/−; Sun2−/− mutants (Figures 3A–3D). These results indicate that SUN1 and SUN2 are essential and mutually redundant for the normal radial neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. The same BrdU birth-dating assay was also applied to Syne-1/2 mutants. Syne-1−/−; Syne-2+/− and Syne-1+/−; Syne-2−/− mice were intercrossed, and BrdU was introduced into the pregnant mothers at E12.5 or E14."
https://openalex.org/W1969939835,"Two groups present redshift determinations and other spectroscopic data for the γ-ray burst GRB 090423 — now the earliest and most distant astronomical object known. Salvaterra et al. report its initial detection with the Swift satellite on 23 April 2009, and a redshift determination with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on La Palma 14 hours after the burst, obtaining z ≈ 8.1. Tanvir et al. used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, Hawaii, from about 20 minutes after the burst and arrive at z ≈ 8.2. The previous highest redshift known for any object was z = 6.96 for a Lyman-α emitting galaxy. These measurements imply that massive stars were being produced and were dying as γ-ray bursts as early as about 600 million years after the Big Bang, and that their properties are very similar to those stars producing γ-ray bursts 10 billion years later. Long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs), thought to result from the explosions of certain massive stars, are bright enough that some of them should be observable out to redshifts of z > 20. So far, the highest redshift measured for any object has been z = 6.96, for a Lyman-α emitting galaxy. Here, and in an accompanying paper, GRB 090423 is reported to lie at a redshift of z ≈ 8.2, implying that massive stars were being produced and dying as GRBs approximately 620 million years after the Big Bang. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by rare types of massive stellar explosion. Their rapidly fading afterglows are often bright enough at optical wavelengths that they are detectable at cosmological distances. Hitherto, the highest known redshift for a GRB was z = 6.7 (ref. 1), for GRB 080913, and for a galaxy was z = 6.96 (ref. 2). Here we report observations of GRB 090423 and the near-infrared spectroscopic measurement of its redshift, z = . This burst happened when the Universe was only about 4 per cent of its current age3. Its properties are similar to those of GRBs observed at low/intermediate redshifts, suggesting that the mechanisms and progenitors that gave rise to this burst about 600,000,000 years after the Big Bang are not markedly different from those producing GRBs about 10,000,000,000 years later."

https://openalex.org/W2061619540,"GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is predominantly released by local interneurons in the cerebral cortex to particular subcellular domains of the target cells. This suggests that compartmentalized, synapse-specific action of GABA is required in cortical networks for phasic inhibition. However, GABA released at the synaptic cleft diffuses to receptors outside the postsynaptic density and thus tonically activates extrasynaptic GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, which include subtypes of both receptor families especially sensitive to low concentrations of GABA. The synaptic and extrasynaptic action of GABA corroborates the idea that neurons of the brain use synaptic (or wiring) transmission and non-synaptic (or volume) transmission for communication. However, re-uptake mechanisms restrict the spatial extent of extrasynaptic GABA-mediated effects, and it has been proposed that the concerted action of several presynaptic interneurons, the sustained firing of individual cells or an increase in release-site density is required to reach ambient GABA levels sufficient to activate extrasynaptic receptors. Here we show that individual neurogliaform cells release enough GABA for volume transmission within the axonal cloud and, thus, that neurogliaform cells do not require synapses to produce inhibitory responses in the overwhelming majority of nearby neurons. Neurogliaform cells suppress connections between other neurons acting on presynaptic terminals that do not receive synapses at all in the cerebral cortex. They also reach extrasynaptic, delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) (GABA(Adelta)) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition. We show that GABA(Adelta) receptors are localized to neurogliaform cells preferentially among cortical interneurons. Neurosteroids, which are modulators of GABA(Adelta) receptors, alter unitary GABA-mediated effects between neurogliaform cells. In contrast to the specifically placed synapses formed by other interneurons, the output of neurosteroid-sensitive neurogliaform cells represents the ultimate form of the lack of spatial specificity in GABA-mediated systems, leading to long-lasting network hyperpolarization combined with widespread suppression of communication in the local circuit."

We identified a full spectrum of genetic properties related to its genome plasticity such as repeated sequences, insertion sequences, phage-like proteins, integrases, recombinases and genomic islands. In addition, analysis also indicated that a substantial proportion of the E. tarda genome might be devoted to the growth and survival under diverse conditions including intracellular niches, with a large number of aerobic or anaerobic respiration-associated proteins, signal transduction proteins as well as proteins involved in various stress adaptations. A pool of genes for secretion systems, pili formation, nonfimbrial adhesions, invasions and hemagglutinins, chondroitinases, hemolysins, iron scavenging systems as well as the incomplete flagellar biogenesis might feature its surface structures and pathogenesis in a fish body.Genomic analysis of the bacterium offered insights into the phylogeny, metabolism, drug-resistance, stress adaptation, and virulence characteristics of this versatile pathogen, which constitutes an important first step in understanding the pathogenesis of E. tarda to facilitate construction of a practical effective vaccine used for combating fish edwardsiellosis."

We used quantitative immunoblotting to determine the abundance and stoichiometry of the shelterin proteins in the chromatin-bound protein fraction of human cells. The abundance of shelterin components was similar in primary and transformed cells and was not correlated with telomere length. The duplex telomeric DNA binding factors in shelterin, TRF1 and TRF2, were sufficiently abundant to cover all telomeric DNA in cells with short telomeres. The TPP1.POT1 heterodimer was present 50-100 copies/telomere, which is in excess of its single-stranded telomeric DNA binding sites, indicating that some of the TPP1.POT1 in shelterin is not associated with the single-stranded telomeric DNA. TRF2 and Rap1 were present at 1:1 stoichiometry as were TPP1 and POT1. The abundance of TIN2 was sufficient to allow each TRF1 and TRF2 to bind to TIN2. Remarkably, TPP1 and POT1 were approximately 10-fold less abundant than their TIN2 partner in shelterin, raising the question of what limits the accumulation of TPP1 x POT1 at telomeres. Finally, we report that a 10-fold reduction in TRF2 affects the regulation of telomere length but not the protection of telomeres in tumor cell lines."

We report that combinatorial therapies administered 6 weeks, and as long as 15 months, after SCI promote axonal regeneration into and beyond a midcervical lesion site. Provision of peripheral nerve conditioning lesions, grafts of marrow stromal cells, and establishment of NT-3 gradients supports bridging regeneration. Controls receiving partial components of the full combination fail to exhibit bridging. Notably, intraneuronal molecular mechanisms recruited by delayed therapies mirror those of acute injury, including activation of transcriptional activators and regeneration-associated genes.

We show that a multiligand binding site for ATP and calmodulin previously identified in the TRPV1 ankyrin repeat domain is conserved in TRPV3 and TRPV4, but not TRPV2. Accordingly, TRPV2 is insensitive to intracellular ATP, while, as previously observed with TRPV1, a sensitizing effect of ATP on TRPV4 required an intact binding site. In contrast, ATP reduced TRPV3 sensitivity and potentiation by repeated agonist stimulations. Thus, ATP and calmodulin, acting through this conserved binding site, are key players in generating the different sensitivity and adaptation profiles of TRPV1, TRPV3, and TRPV4. Our results suggest that competing interactions of ATP and calmodulin influence channel sensitivity to fluctuations in calcium concentration and perhaps even metabolic state. Different feedback mechanisms likely arose because of the different physiological stimuli or temperature thresholds of these channels."

We have identified six raptor phosphorylation sites that lie in two centrally localized clusters (cluster 1, Ser696/Thr706 and cluster 2, Ser855/Ser859/Ser863/Ser877) using tandem mass spectrometry and generated phosphospecific antibodies for each of these sites. Here we focus primarily although not exclusively on raptor Ser863 phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2044588542,"Plant NADPH oxidases (Rboh, for respiratory burst oxidase homolog) produce reactive oxygen species that are key regulators of various cellular events including plant innate immunity. Rbohs possess a highly conserved cytoplasmic N-terminal region containing two EF-hand motifs that regulate Rboh activity. Rice (Oryza sativa) RbohB (OsRbohB) is regulated by the direct binding of a small GTPase (Rac1) to this regulatory region as well as by Ca(2+) binding to the EF-hands. Here, we present the atomic structure of the N-terminal region of OsRbohB. The structure reveals that OsRbohB forms a unique dimer stabilized by swapping the EF-hand motifs. We identified two additional EF-hand-like motifs that were not predicted from sequence data so far. These EF-hand-like motifs together with the swapped EF-hands form a structure similar to that found in calcineurin B. We observed conformational changes mediated by Ca(2+) binding to only one EF-hand. Structure-based in vitro pulldown assays and NMR titration experiments defined the OsRac1 binding interface within the coiled-coil region created by swapping the EF-hands. In addition, we demonstrate a direct intramolecular interaction between the N and C terminus, and that the complete N-terminal cytoplasmic region is required for this interaction. The structural features and intramolecular interactions characterized here might be common elements shared by Rbohs that contribute to the regulation of reactive oxygen species production."

The pathway and regulation of GLUT4 trafficking are complicated and incompletely understood and are likely to be contingent upon the various proteins other than GLUT4 that comprise and interact with GLUT4-containing vesicles. Moreover, not all GLUT4 intracellular pools are insulin-responsive as some represent precursor compartments, thus posing a biochemical challenge to the purification and characterization of their content. To address these issues, we immunodepleted precursor GLUT4-rich vesicles and then immunopurified GLUT4 storage vesicle (GSVs) from primary rat adipocytes and subjected them to semi-quantitative and quantitative proteomic analysis. The purified vesicles translocate to the cell surface almost completely in response to insulin, the expected behavior for bona fide GSVs. In total, over 100 proteins were identified, about 50 of which are novel in this experimental context. LRP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) was identified as a major constituent of GSVs, and we show it interacts with the lumenal domains of GLUT4 and other GSV constituents. Its cytoplasmic tail interacts with the insulin-signaling pathway target, AS160 (Akt substrate of 160 kDa). Depletion of LRP1 from 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduces GLUT4 expression and correspondingly results in decreased insulin-stimulated 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake.

In addition, kinetic analyses of GLUT4 trafficking are consistent with the interpretation that GLUT4 traffics through multiple intracellular compartments (6Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

These and other data have led to the concept that an ultimate target of insulin signaling is a subpopulation of translocating GLUT4-containing membranes that are commonly referred to as GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs) 3The abbreviations used are: GSVGLUT4 storages vesicleAS160Akt substrate 160 kDaCIM6PRcation-independent mannose 6-phosphateIRAPinsulin-responsive aminopeptidaseICATisotope-coded affinity tagLMlight microsomalTfRtransferrin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salineMSmass spectrometryLCliquid chromatographyMS/MStandem MSshRNAsmall hairpin RNAPMplasma membranePAIprotein abundance indexGSTglutathione S-transferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineeGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein.

With the advent of mass spectrometry, numerous additional proteins were identified as constituents of GLUT4-rich vesicles, notably components of the vesicular trafficking machinery (17Thurmond D.C.

Vamp2 had been shown previously to be a component of GLUT4 vesicles by immunological means (19Mastick C.C. Falick A.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The receptors for TfR and CIM6PR were shown to be insulin-responsive by ligand binding studies (20Appell K.C. Simpson I.A. Cushman S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10824-10829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tanner L.I. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8975-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but it was not clear if they were components of GLUT4-containing vesicles at that time. The limitation of the previous studies of GLUT4-enriched vesicles is that they analyzed the entire population of GLUT4-containing intracellular membranes and not just GSVs, the presumed end point target of insulin signaling. To purify GSVs, an immunological reagent that marks only GSV precursors is required, and such a reagent is a monoclonal antibody to cellugyrin (22Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cellugyrin (23Janz R. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2851-2857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is a member of the tetraspan family of vesicle membrane proteins that are ubiquitous components of membrane vesicles of as yet unknown function (24Hübner K. Windoffer R. Hutter H. Leube R.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 214: 103-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cellugyrin was identified as a component of GLUT4 vesicles by immunological means (22Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36263-36268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and was shown to be present only in the ∼50% of GLUT4-containing membranes that do not translocate to the cell surface (25Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, we use an anti-cellugyrin monoclonal antibody to immunodeplete GSV precursor vesicles and then an anti-GLUT4 antibody to immunoisolate GSVs. Both populations were subjected to proteomic analysis, and over 100 proteins were identified. One of the most abundant proteins found in the proteomic analysis of GSVs was LRP1 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), the largest member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. LRP1 is involved in many physiological functions, including lipid and glucose metabolism, cellular entry of viruses and toxins, activation of lysosomal enzymes, cellular signal transduction, and neurotransmission (26Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyze the distribution and trafficking of LRP1 in adipocytes and its interactions with GLUT4. We show that LRP1 is an important component of GSVs whose depletion in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has significant effects on GLUT4 expression and insulin-dependent glucose uptake and whose absence in mouse adipocytes also leads to GLUT4 deficiency.

Chem. 1997; 272: 971-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells for lentivirus propagation were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. LRP1 knockdown experiments were carried out using short hairpin RNA interference sequences. LRP1 mouse lentiviral (pLKO.1) vectors were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) with the following sequences (Open Biosystems catalogue no. TRCN0000119622 to TRCN0000119625) (sense loop antisense): ccgggctgaacacattctttggtaactcgagttaccaaagaatgtgttcagctttttg; ccgggcgaacaaatacactggctaactcgagttagccagtgtatttgttcgctttttg; ccggcggagtcacttacatcaataactcgagttattgatgtaagtgactccgtttttg; and ccggcgcttgtgtattcccaagcatctcgagatgcttgggaatacacaagcgtttttg. Forty percent confluent HEK293T cells (in a p150) were co-transfected with 24 μg of pLKO.1 LRP1 mouse lentiviral vector or pLKO.1 eGFP lentiviral vector containing 1.2 μg of TAT, 1.2 μg of REV, 1.2 μg of GAG/POL, 2.4 μg of VSV-G viral packaging plasmids using 90 μl of Trans-IT® 293 from Mirus (Madison, WI), and transfection conditions were followed as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, media were collected and filtered through a 45-μm pore size Whatman filter and was infected onto 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. After an additional 48 h post-infection, media were removed, and cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in 10% calf serum for an additional 48 h. LRP1 shRNA Target TRCN0000–119625 had the highest knockdown efficiency and was used for all subsequent studies, i.e. Western blotting, and 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake assays were performed as described previously (27Stephens J.M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Primary rat adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion. Fractionation into cell surface and internal membranes was achieved by differential centrifugation as described previously (29Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys.

The light microsomal fraction (1 mg of protein) was subjected to centrifugation in a 4.6-ml 10–30% (w/w) continuous sucrose gradient and spun at 250,000 × g in a Beckman Instruments (Palo Alto, CA) SW 55.1 rotor for 50 min at 4 °C. Fractions from the gradients were collected and analyzed for GLUT4 by gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis prior to pooling of fractions for immunoadsorption. Protein A-purified monoclonal 1F8 (GLUT4) antibody, affinity-purified polyclonal cellugyrin (BIOSOURCE), as well as nonspecific mouse immunoglobulin G (50 μg each) were coupled to 500-μl Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Prior to use, the antibody-coupled beads were cross-linked with 1 ml of 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (Pierce) in 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.2, for 30 min at 20 °C. The reactions were quenched with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 20 °C and washed three times with PBS. All subsequent steps were carried as described previously (25Kupriyanova T.A. Kandror V. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9133-9138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of membrane proteins was performed as described (31Pilch P.F. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3375-3381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated light microsomal (LM) (30Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) fraction (100 μg of protein) from rat epididymal fat was resuspended in 500 μl of PBS containing both protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) in DMSO was added to a final concentration of 2 mm for 30 min at 20 °C. The reaction was quenched with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 20 °C, and solubilized with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (50 μl) was coupled to either 5 μg of nonspecific mouse immunoglobulin G or 5 μg of protein A-purified monoclonal 1F8 GLUT4 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The antibodies were coupled to protein A/G with dimethyl pimelimidate as described above for the immunoadsorption experiments. Cross-linked LM was then rotated with IgG beads for 2 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and further incubated with 1F8 GLUT4 beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were removed, and beads were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100. Beads were eluted with 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Eluates were removed from the beads, and dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C. Equal proportions of eluate and supernatant were resolved by gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting. Cultured cells were disrupted by ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 4% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% SDS, 1 mm pepstatin, 1 mm aprotinin, and 10 mm leupeptin; and phosphatase inhibitors I and II were added (Sigma). Lysates were vortexed and spun for 30 min at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C; supernatants were collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using the BCA kit (Pierce). Adipose tissue lysates from 8-week-old male LRP1 lox/lox mice and age-matched aP2Cre+, LRP1 lox/lox mice (32Hofmann S.M. Zhou L. Perez-Tilve D. Greer T. Grant E. Wancata L. Thomas A. Pfluger P.T.

Invest. 2007; 117: 3271-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were prepared by grinding frozen tissue with a mortar and pestle in the above lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes pretreated with methanol (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then probed with the primary antibodies for either overnight at 4 °C or 2 h at room temperature and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Signals were enhanced with chemiluminescent reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for detection of Western signals. To generate the GST-fused C-terminal cytosolic tails for LRP1 and sortilin and N-terminal IRAP, the coding regions of each cytosolic domain were cloned from cDNA derived from epididymal fat pads of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats into a pGEX-5X-1 vector (GE Healthcare). The PCR cloning oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) are as follows: sense LRP1 cytosolic domain primer with an EcoRI restriction site, 5′-gatcgaattctgatcctctgctgc-3′, and an antisense primer with an XhoI restriction site, 5′-gatcctcgagctatgctaagggatcccc-3′; sense sortilin cytosolic domain primer with an EcoRI restriction site, 5′-gatcgaattcgtgaagaagtatgtctgt, and an antisense primer with an XhoI restriction site, 5′-gatcctcgagctattccaggaggtcctc-3′. All PCR products were digested with their corresponding restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and ligated into their correspondingly digested pGEX-5X-1 vector. Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry by disulfide bond reduction and alkylation prior to separation by SDS-PAGE on precast 4–15% acrylamide gradient gels (Bio-Rad) and in-gel trypsin digestion as described (34Li X. Gerber S.A. Rudner A.D. Beausoleil S.A. Haas W. Villén J. Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 1190-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). LC-MS/MS data were obtained using a LTQ Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer. Dried peptides were suspended in 10 μl of 5% acetonitrile, 3% acetic acid, and 4 μl were loaded onto a pulled fused silica microcapillary column (100 μm inner diameter, 12-cm bed) packed with C18 reverse phase resin (Magic C18AQ, 5-μm particles; 200 Åpore size; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). Peptides were resolved using an Agilent 1100 series binary pump across a 30-min linear gradient of 8–25% acetonitrile in 0.2% formic acid at a 250 nl/min flow rate. In each data collection cycle, one full MS scan (375–1600 m/z) was acquired in the Orbitrap (6 × 104 resolution setting; automatic gain control target of 106) followed by 10 data-dependent MS/MS scans in the LTQ (AGC target 5000; threshold 3000) using the 10 most abundant ions for collision-induced dissociation for fragmentation. The method dynamically excluded previously selected ions for 30 s, singly charged ions, and unassigned charged states. Raw files obtained from the MS and MS/MS data collection were converted into mzXML format using the ReAdW program. Monoisotopic precursor ion and charge state information for each acquired MS/MS spectra were extracted by in-house software. The SEQUEST search algorithm was used to search the MS/MS spectra against the Mouse or Rat NCBI. The search parameters for post-translational modifications included a static modification of 57.02146 Da on cysteine (carboxyamidomethylation) and dynamic modification of 15.99491 Da for methionine (oxidation) residues. All peptides were based on the following filtering criteria: charge +1, Xcorr ≥2.0 ΔCn ≥0.01; charge +2, Xcorr ≥1.5 ΔCn ≥0.01; charge +3, Xcorr ≥2.0 ΔCn ≥ 0.03 with a mass accuracy ±50 ppm. A given protein was considered correct (35Elias J.E. Haas W. Faherty B.K. Gygi S.P. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) when >2 tryptic peptides were identified meeting or exceeding the aforementioned criteria. For the c-ICAT labeling experiments (below), a static modification of 227.12699 Da cysteine (light) and dynamic modifications of 9.03019 Da (heavy) cysteine with the aforementioned Xcorr, ΔCn, and ppm parameters was used. Peptides pairs were submitted to quantitative analysis by an in-house software, VISTA, which has been described previously (36Bakalarski C.E. Elias J.E. Villén J. Haas W. Gerber S.A. Everley P.A. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 4756-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ICAT labeling of vesicle proteins was achieved as described previously (37Ramus C. Gonzalez de Peredo A. Dahout C. Gallagher M. Garin J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 68-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Heavy and light labeled immunoadsorptions were combined for IgG control and GLUT4 samples and loaded onto a 4–15% SDS-PAGE pre-cast gel (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Gels were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion as described above. Peptides labeled with c-ICAT were purified with the avidin column supplied in the c-ICAT kit. Dried peptides were cleaved from their acid-labile moiety as recommended by the manufacturer and dried before nano-LC-MS/MS. IgG and GLUT4 samples were run in triplicate. In principle, vesicles can be immunoadsorbed directly from the light microsomal (LM) fraction of rat adipocytes, but mass spectral analysis following such a protocol revealed excessive cytoskeletal and ribosomal contaminants that complicated identification of vesicle proteins (data not shown). Accordingly, a sucrose gradient step was used first as shown in Fig. 1 where the boxed part of the gradient was concentrated and immunoadsorbed as shown in Fig. 2A. Both FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 reveal that cellugyrin does not significantly redistribute upon insulin stimulation, whereas GLUT4 and IRAP are markedly depleted from the LM fraction after insulin treatment. Quantitative analysis of the sequential immunoadsorption shows that 90% or greater of the GLUT4 and IRAP translocate from the cellugyrin-negative vesicles, and they translocate not at all or to a much lesser extent from the cellugyrin-positive vesicular pool (Fig. 2B). This nearly complete insulin-dependent redistribution of IRAP and GLUT4 is the expected behavior for bona fide GSVs. Thus, mass spectrometric analysis of the two immunoadsorbed fractions, before and after cellular insulin treatment, was used to identify their protein composition and determine the extent of protein translocation.FIGURE 2A, immunoadsorption of GLUT4-enriched sucrose gradient fractions show two distinction populations of GLUT4 vesicles. Separately pooled (as in Fig. 1) fractions for basal and insulin-treated rat adipocytes were precleared with anti-mouse IgG beads for 2 h, and the supernatants were immunoadsorbed with anti-cellugyrin (CG) beads for 2 h. Supernatants were collected and subjected to a subsequent GLUT4 (G4) immunoadsorption. All beads were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, and eluted with 100 μl of electrophoresis buffer. Equal proportions of IgG, cellugyrin, GLUT4, and supernatant were loaded on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blot (WB) with proteins indicated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, quantification of Western blots reveals GLUT4 vesicles depleted of cellugyrin translocate upon insulin stimulation. Relative amounts of cellugyrin (CG), IRAP, GLUT4, and Vamp2 were determined by scanning and analysis with NIH image software, and the results are represented graphically. These results are representative of experiments done five times.

We do not include ribosomal protein components in our data set, and we list in supplemental Table 2 as likely contaminants, proteins highly abundant in adipocytes such as caveolin-1 and several enzymes of lipid metabolism (fatty-acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase), as these bind to control IgG in significant amounts. We also exclude from Fig. 3 the nonabundant Rab GTPase proteins (38Jordens I. Marsman M. Kuijl C. Neefjes J. Traffic. 2005; 6: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Sc"
https://openalex.org/W2132842784,"Atoh1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a critical role in the differentiation of several epithelial and neural cell types. We found that β-catenin, the key mediator of the canonical Wnt pathway, increased expression of Atoh1 in mouse neuroblastoma cells and neural progenitor cells, and baseline Atoh1 expression was decreased by siRNA directed at β-catenin. The up-regulation of Atoh1 was caused by an interaction of β-catenin with the Atoh1 enhancer that could be demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We found that two putative Tcf-Lef sites in the 3′ enhancer of the Atoh1 gene displayed an affinity for β-catenin and were critical for the activation of Atoh1 transcription because mutation of either site decreased expression of a reporter gene downstream of the enhancer. Tcf-Lef co-activators were found in the complex that bound to these sites in the DNA together with β-catenin. Inhibition of Notch signaling, which has previously been shown to induce bHLH transcription factor expression, increased β-catenin expression in progenitor cells of the nervous system. Because this could be a mechanism for up-regulation of Atoh1 after inhibition of Notch, we tested whether siRNA to β-catenin prevented the increase in Atoh1 and found that β-catenin expression was required for increased expression of Atoh1 after Notch inhibition. Atoh1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a critical role in the differentiation of several epithelial and neural cell types. We found that β-catenin, the key mediator of the canonical Wnt pathway, increased expression of Atoh1 in mouse neuroblastoma cells and neural progenitor cells, and baseline Atoh1 expression was decreased by siRNA directed at β-catenin.

Upstream regulators of Atoh1 are likely to have an important role in the regulation of development in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in the intestinal epithelium, all of which rely on Atoh1 for differentiation. This finding was clear from the analysis of an Atoh1-null mouse, which lacks many of the cell types of the intestinal epithelium, and has incomplete development of cerebellar and spinal neurons and a complete lack of inner ear hair cells (1Bermingham N.A.

In a search for genes that affected Atoh1 expression, a number of genes were tested for their effect on Atoh1 expression by screening of an adenoviral library that allowed us to express the genes in various cell types. One such gene was β-catenin, the intracellular mediator of the canonical Wnt pathway. Its overexpression in neural progenitor cell types increased activity of a reporter construct containing GFP under the control of one of the Atoh1 enhancers (12Lumpkin E.A. Collisson T. Parab P.

Atoh1 has a 1.7-kb enhancer 3′ of its coding region, which is sufficient to direct expression of a heterologous reporter gene in several Atoh1 expression domains in transgenic mice (13Helms A.W.

Jeon, M. Fujioka, and A. S. B. Edge, in preparation. but did not identify the factors that increased Atoh1 after Notch inhibition. We found that β-catenin expression was increased after inhibition of Notch signaling and that this increase accounted for the effect of Notch inhibitors on Atoh1 expression. This indicated that expression of β-catenin was normally prevented by active Notch signaling and that β-catenin occupied a position upstream of Atoh1 in these cells. We found that β-catenin bound to the Atoh1 enhancer along with Tcf-Lef transcriptional co-activators, indicating that it directly affected Atoh1 expression. Neuro2a cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm Glutamax, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

The cells were dissociated and cultured in suspension in DMEM supplemented with N2 (Invitrogen) to generate nestin-positive neural progenitors (17Corrales C.E. Pan L. Li H. Liberman M.C. Heller S.

Heller S. Edge A.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2007; 34: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cells were expanded once before use and cultured in MEM-α supplemented with 9% horse serum, 9% fetal calf serum, and penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, Calbiochem-EMD Bioscience) or a GSK3β inhibitor, (SB415286, Sigma). The compounds were stored as 40 mm stock in DMSO at −20 °C and added at the concentrations given in the text. Wnt3a-conditioned medium was harvested from L-Wnt3a cells (from ATCC, CRL-2647), which were stably transfected with a Wnt3a expression vector and secrete biologically active Wnt3a protein. Control conditioned medium harvested from the parental cell line L (from ATCC, CRL-2648) was used in experiments involving the Wnt3a-conditioned medium. L cells and L-Wnt3a cells were culture in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum with supplement of 0.4 mg/ml G-418 for L-Wnt3a cells. The conditioned medium was harvested according to the ATCC protocol, sterile-filtered, and stored at −20 °C until use.

Glicksman, and A. S. B. Edge, in preparation. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Atoh1-Luc was denatured and annealed to the oligonucleotide primers, TAT CAC CCA AAC AAA tcc gGA GTC AGC ACT TCT T (296–329)/CCC AGG CAA GGA GTC ACC CCC gcg acg TCT GGC TCC TAA CTG AAA AAG (945–992), with the mutations in Tcf-Lef binding sites (lowercase) underlined in the primers. Following temperature cycling, circular DNA was generated from the template vector containing the incorporated mutated Tcf-Lef binding sites using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase, and methylated, parental DNA was digested with Dpn1 endonuclease. Finally the circular, nicked dsDNA was transformed into competent cells for repair. siRNAs for silencing of Atoh1 (NM_007500, NM-005172, gca acg uua ucc cgu ccu u UAA CAG CGA UGA UGG CAC A) and β-catenin (NM_007614, NM_001904, GCG CUU GGC UGA ACC AUC AUU, GUG AAA UUC UUG GCU AUU AUU) were obtained from Dharmacon. The more efficient of two siRNA sequences for gene silencing based on quantitative PCR was chosen for each gene. The siRNA (200 nm) was combined with siRNA transfection reagent GeneSilencerTM (5 μl/ml; Gene Therapy Systems) and incubated with the cells for 16 h. Cells were harvested at 48 h. Non-targeting siRNA was transfected in parallel as a control. Transfection efficiency was determined with the fluorescent-labeled non-targeting siRNA. Cells were counted on an epifluorescent microsope (Axioskop 2 Mot Axiocam; Zeiss) and analyzed with a Metamorph Imaging System. Real-time RT-PCR was performed after exposure to the targeting siRNA and the non-targeting siRNA to confirm gene silencing.

Transfection was carried out for 4 h, and after washing, followed by incubation with medium. Cells were harvested at 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and 1 μg of RNA was subjected to RT-PCR with SuperTransciptTM III and TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The primer sequences were as follows: Atoh1, forward, AGA TCT ACA TCA ACG CTC TGT C; reverse, ACT GGC CTC ATC AGA GTC ACT G (449bp); GAPDH, forward, AAC GGG AAG CCC ATC ACC; reverse, CAG CCT TGG CAG CAC CAG (442bp); β-catenin, forward, ATG CGC TCC CCT CAG ATG GTG TC; reverse, TCG CGG TGG TGA GAA AGG TTG TGC (113bp). Annealing temperature and cycles were optimized for each primer. PCR primers for real-time PCR of Atoh1 and S18 were ordered from Applied Biosystems, and PCR was performed in a Perkin Elmer ABI PRISMTM 7700 Sequence Detector (PE Applied Biosystems). In brief, 5 × 107 Neuro2a cells (175-cm2 culture flasks) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in DMEM for 10 min, followed by 5 min at 37 °C in formaldehyde saturated with glycine. The cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted for 10 min at 720 × g at 4 °C. The nuclei were released in a Dounce homogenizer in PBS containing protease inhibitors and collected at 4 °C by centrifugation at 2,400 × g. Sheared chromatin was collected in the supernatant by centrifugation (8,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min) after treatment of the nuclei with the enzymatic mixture from a ChIP-ITTM Express kit (Active Motif) for 10 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (10 μl) of the sheared DNA was saved as the input sample for PCR, and the rest (3 × 80 μl) was split for immunoprecipitation using 1 μg of mouse anti-β-catenin antibody (Upstate, 05-601, 1:100), mouse anti-LEF-1 antibody (Sigma L7901), or nonimmune mouse serum (Sigma). The precipitated chromatin was recovered after reversing cross-links, and the proteins were digested with proteinase K.

Nuclei were isolated from 106 Neuro2a cells following mechanical disruption with a 20-gauge needle. Proteins were extracted from nuclei in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (Sigma) with fresh proteinase inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma) at 4 °C for 60 min. Chromatin DNA was pelleted at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear lysate in the supernatant was collected. Biotin-labeled DNA probes (0.3 μg) with or without 10 μg of unlabeled DNA probe were incubated with 40 μl of nuclear lysate with proteinase inhibitors for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5, 40 mm 20 mer poly A and poly C). Probes used were (mutations shown in lowercase): ATC ACC CAA ACA AAC AAA GAG TCA GCA CTT (297–326); ATC ACC CAA ACA cAT Acg aAG TCA GCA CTT (mutant 297–326); GTT AGG AGC CAG AAG CAA AGG GGG TGA CTC (956–985); GTT AGG AGC CAG AgG atc gtG GGG TGA CTC (mutant 956–985). Probe-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin magnetic beads (50 μl, Amersham Biosciences). Precipitated proteins were washed 5× with binding buffer and boiled in 50 μl of 2× sample buffer, and the supernatant was collected for Western blotting with anti-β-catenin antibody and anti-Lef-1-Tcf antibody. Proteins extracted with RIPA buffer from whole cells or after nuclear fractionation were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were probed with sheep anti-Lef-1-Tcf antibody (Sigma L4270), rabbit anti-β-catenin antibody (Sigma C2206), rabbit anti-Atoh1 (ABR, PA1–17101), mouse anti-unphosphorylated β-catenin (Millipore, 35222), mouse anti-phosphorylated GSK3β Y216 (BD 612312), or mouse anti-GSK3β (BD 610201) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-rabbit (Chemicon), or anti-mouse (Chemicon) antibodies. The blots were processed with ECLTM (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were stripped with RestoreTM Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific), followed by probing with mouse anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma A2228) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). 105 Neuro2a cells were seeded into a 24-well plate 1 day before transfection. 0.125 μg of Atoh1-luciferase reporter construct, CBF1-luciferase reporter construct (23Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 952-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), 0.125 μg of TOPFlash, or FOPFlash (Addgene), or 0.125 μg of Renilla-luciferase construct with or without 0.25 μg of β-catenin expression construct were mixed with 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 0.125 ml of opti-MEM and incubated with the cells for 4 h. Cells were lysed after 48 h, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). The effect of β-catenin overexpression and silencing on Atoh1 levels was measured in two neural cell types, a neuroblastoma cell line and neural progenitors derived from embryonic stem cells. Overexpression of β-catenin in Neuro2a cells increased expression of Atoh1 mRNA based on RT-PCR (β-cat, Fig. 1A). Expression of Atoh1 was also up-regulated in neural progenitors after overexpression of β-catenin (β-cat, Fig. 1A). The increase was significant for both Neuro2a cells (871.3 ± 141.3) and neural progenitors (741.2 ± 218.2) as determined by quantitative RT-PCR compared with cells transfected with a GFP vector without β-catenin (1.1 ± 0.1) or untreated cells (1 ± 0.2) (p < 0.01, Fig. 1B). Atoh1 expression was also increased after transfection with Atoh1 cDNA as a control (Atoh1, Fig. 1, A and B). Atoh1 expression was decreased by Atoh1 siRNA (siRNA-Atoh1, Fig. 1C), used as a positive control, but not by non-targeting siRNA (siRNA-non-targ, Fig. 1C) or no siRNA (Ctl, Fig. 1C). The extent of the decrease in Atoh1 mRNA after silencing with siRNA directed to Atoh1 was 57 ± 1.4% (Fig. 1D). β-Catenin siRNA decreased β-catenin expression by 62 ± 6% as determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Silencing β-catenin expression with siRNA directed to β-catenin decreased Atoh1 mRNA levels in Neuro2a cells and neural progenitors based on RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). Down-regulation of β-catenin decreased Atoh1 expression by 37.2 ± 1.0% in Neuro2a cells and 21.8 ± 0.5% in neural progenitors. The decrease in Atoh1 expression determined by quantitative RT-PCR after treatment with β-catenin siRNA was significant (p < 0.01, Fig. 1D). The level of β-catenin activity as measured by the TOPFlash reporter, which contains multiple binding sites for β-catenin complexed to Tcf-Lef co-activators, was proportional to the concentration of β-catenin cDNA (Fig. 1E), and the increase in TOPFlash signal correlated with an increased expression of Atoh1. Increased amounts of β-catenin cDNA also raised the level of the active fraction of nuclear β-catenin, which is recognized by an antibody (24van Noort M. Weerkamp F. Clevers H.C. Staal F.J. Blood. 2007; 110: 2778-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to the unphosphorylated form (β-catenin*) in correlation with Atoh1 (Fig. 1F). Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a) also resulted in parallel increases in the level of both nuclear unphosphorylated β-catenin and Atoh1, whereas overexpression of dominant-negative Tcf4 (dnTcf), which lacks the β-catenin binding site, decreased the level of Atoh1. These experiments demonstrated a correlation between the level of expression of β-catenin and Atoh1. To define the binding sites on the mouse Atoh1 enhancer, we searched the 3′ enhancer sequence. The software indicated two potential binding sites for β-catenin in combination with Tcf-Lef transcriptional co-activators at 309–315 and 966–972 (AF218258). To investigate whether β-catenin in combination with Tcf-Lef factors has a direct interaction with regulatory regions of the Atoh1 gene, we analyzed the DNA binding to β-catenin and Tcf-Lef by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Sheared and cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with β-catenin or Tcf-Lef antibodies, and the precipitated chromatin was amplified by PCR using primers covering the entire 1.3-kB sequence in overlapping segments. β-Catenin and Tcf-Lef antibody immunoprecipitated DNA at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the 1.3-kB sequence indicating that DNA in the regions had an affinity for both of the proteins (Fig. 2, β-catenin and Tcf/Lef). The intermediate sequences did not display this affinity suggesting that this sequence contained binding sites at its ends as predicted. These sequences were not amplified by PCR from chromatin immunoprecipitated with nonimmune IgG (Fig. 2, serum), whereas the same DNA fragments were co-precipitated by β-catenin and Tcf-Lef antibodies. This shows that these proteins bound to the same sequences of DNA. The precise localization of the binding sites could not be ascertained from the PCR data because the shearing of the DNA is variable, and, despite repeated attempts, the variable lengths of sheared DNA led to different patterns of bands from the overlapping primers. To determine the precise sequences that had an affinity for β-catenin and Tcf-Lef we performed DNA pull-down assays with two biotin-labeled oligonucleotides probes, covering bases 297–326 and 956–985 of the Atoh1 sequence, which contained the predicted Tcf-Lef binding sites and surrounding nucleotides. Incubation of the probes with nuclear lysate from Neuro2a cells was followed by precipitation with streptavidin beads. By Western blotting of the proteins interacting with the probes, both β-catenin and Tcf-Lef could be detected (Fig. 3A, probe 309 and probe 966). The binding of β-catenin and Tcf-Lef to the probes was reduced by competition with unlabeled probes (Fig. 3A, comp 309 and comp 966), and mutation of the predicted binding sites reduced binding in both cases (Fig. 3A, mutant 309 and mutant 966). The correlation between β-catenin binding and Tcf-Lef binding suggested that the proteins were involved in a complex, and this agreed with the ChIP data showing that both proteins could be precipitated from the binding sites in the native DNA. This experiment also suggested that both of the potential binding sites on the Atoh1 enhancer bound to the complex of Tcf-Lef with β-catenin. The expression of Atoh1 in Neuro2a cells transfected with β-catenin (1 μg/ml) or co-transfected with dominant-negative Tcf4 was analyzed by real-time PCR from two independent experiments (each experiment in triplicate). The increase in Atoh1 expression after overexpression of β-catenin was inhibited in reverse proportion to the concentration of dominant-negative Tcf4 (p < 0.01, Fig. 3B), and the extent of inhibition was nearly complete at the higher level, indicating that a complex with Tcf-Lef was required for activation of Atoh1 by β-catenin. To determine whether the two β-catenin binding sites on the Atoh1 enhancer increased the functional activity of the Atoh1 enhancer, we constructed Atoh1 enhancer-reporter genes with an intact or mutated Atoh1 3′ enhancer. Each of the β-catenin binding sites in the Atoh1 enhancer were mutated, alone or in combination, in a luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 4). We found that overexpression of β-catenin had no effect on a luciferase construct without the Atoh1 enhancer (Fig. 4, Luc), but transfection of β-catenin at the same time as the reporter containing the native Atoh1 enhancer increased reporter gene expression (Fig. 4, Atoh1-Luc). Up-regulation of Atoh1 enhancer activity was reduced when the first β-catenin binding site was mutated (Fig. 4, Atoh1-Luc, mutant 309). β-Catenin-mediated up-regulation of the Atoh1 reporter was also reduced when the second β-catenin binding site in the Atoh1 enhancer was mutated (Fig. 4, Atoh1-Luc, mutant 966). Double mutation of the binding sites completely abolished β-catenin-mediated up-regulation (Fig. 4, Atoh1-Luc, 2X mutant) (p < 0.01). This indicated that β-catenin binding to the Atoh1 enhancer at the binding sites at 309–315 and 966–972 increased activity of the enhancer. The absolute level of the increase likely results from this activity combined with subsequent auto-activation of the 3′ enhancer caused by binding of Atoh1 to its own enhancer (25Helms A.W. Gowan K. Abney A. Savage T. Johnson J.E. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of this auto-feedback loop, we directly transfected the cells with Atoh1 in combination with the Atoh1-luciferase reporter. Atoh1 overexpression up-regulated both unaltered and double mutant Atoh1 reporter about 1.5-fold, indicating that auto-feedback did not account for the level of activation found with β-catenin, but could add to the reporter activity by binding independently to the Atoh1 enhancer. Because Notch also regulates Atoh1 expression, we sought to determine whether increased expression of Atoh1 after treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor3 to inhibit Notch signaling was affected by β-catenin. To observe the effect of a γ-secretase inhibitor, we assessed expression of β-catenin in bone marrow-derived MSCs, cells that were previously shown to have increased Atoh1 expression after Notch inhibition.3 Inhibition of Notch signaling by the γ-secretase inhibitor and up-regulation by transfection of Notch intracellular domain was confirmed in these cells with a CBF-1 luciferase reporter (data not shown). The expression of β-catenin was increased in MSCs treated with a γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 5A, DAPT; quantification of these results is shown in the supplemental data). Atoh1 expression was increased by the inhibition of Notch signaling in the cells that had increased β-catenin (Fig. 5A). A GSK3β inhibitor (GSKi) also increased Atoh1, consistent with its ability to increase β-catenin in these cells (Fig. 5A). To determine whether β-catenin expression was related to increased expression of Atoh1 seen after treatment of these cells with a γ-secretase inhibitor, we blocked β-catenin expression with siRNA and measured the influence on Atoh1. Incubation of MSCs with siRNA to β-catenin decreased β-catenin expression as much as 70% based on quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5B). The siRNA prevented the increase in β-catenin that could be seen after treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig. 5C) and decreased the level of Atoh1 expression (Fig. 5C). We tested the effect of disrupting the Notch pathway by a method other than a γ-secretase inhibitor. Comparison of Atoh1 in wild-type neural progenitor cells and Pofut1−/− cells that have a mutation that prevents Notch signaling showed that Atoh1 expression was higher in the cells that lacked Notch signaling (Fig. 5D), and a γ-secretase inhibitor, which increased Atoh1 expression in control cells, did not further increase Atoh1 expression in Pofut−/− cells, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5D). To see if increased Atoh1 was caused by the higher expression level of β-catenin, we blocked β-catenin expression with siRNA. The deceased level of β-catenin resulted in a decrease in expression of Atoh1 (Fig. 5D), confirming that β-catenin signaling was partly responsible for the increased level of Atoh1 found under conditions of Notch blockage. Disruption of β-catenin-mediated transcription by overexpression of dominant-negative Tcf (dnTcf) reversed the increase of Atoh1 expression in cells treated with the Notch inhibitor (Fig. 5E). Conversely, whereas β-catenin and Atoh1 expression were diminished in cells after elevation of Notch activity, activation of β-catenin-mediated transcription by Wnt3a (Wnt3a"

Free diffusion of urea across cell membranes is slow owing to its high polarity, and specialized urea transporters have evolved to achieve rapid and selective urea permeation. Here we present the 2.3 A structure of a functional urea transporter from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. The transporter is a homotrimer, and each subunit contains a continuous membrane-spanning pore formed by the two homologous halves of the protein. The pore contains a constricted selectivity filter that can accommodate several dehydrated urea molecules in single file. Backbone and side-chain oxygen atoms provide continuous coordination of urea as it progresses through the filter, and well-placed alpha-helix dipoles provide further compensation for dehydration energy. These results establish that the urea transporter operates by a channel-like mechanism and reveal the physical and chemical basis of urea selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1982555694,"Enzymes use substrate-binding energy both to promote ground-state association and to stabilize the reaction transition state selectively. The monomeric homing endonuclease I-AniI cleaves with high sequence specificity in the centre of a 20-base-pair (bp) DNA target site, with the amino (N)-terminal domain of the enzyme making extensive binding interactions with the left (-) side of the target site and the similarly structured carboxy (C)-terminal domain interacting with the right (+) side. Here we show that, despite the approximate twofold symmetry of the enzyme-DNA complex, there is almost complete segregation of interactions responsible for substrate binding to the (-) side of the interface and interactions responsible for transition-state stabilization to the (+) side. Although single base-pair substitutions throughout the entire DNA target site reduce catalytic efficiency, mutations in the (-) DNA half-site almost exclusively increase the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the Michaelis constant under single-turnover conditions (K(M)*), and those in the (+) half-site primarily decrease the turnover number (k(cat)*). The reduction of activity produced by mutations on the (-) side, but not mutations on the (+) side, can be suppressed by tethering the substrate to the endonuclease displayed on the surface of yeast. This dramatic asymmetry in the use of enzyme-substrate binding energy for catalysis has direct relevance to the redesign of endonucleases to cleave genomic target sites for gene therapy and other applications. Computationally redesigned enzymes that achieve new specificities on the (-) side do so by modulating K(M)*, whereas redesigns with altered specificities on the (+) side modulate k(cat)*. Our results illustrate how classical enzymology and modern protein design can each inform the other."
https://openalex.org/W2029334399,"Background Sepsis is a potentially deadly disease that often is caused by gram-positive bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). As there are few effective therapies for sepsis, increased basic knowledge about factors predisposing is needed. Methodology/Principal Findings The purpose of this study was to study the effect of Western diet on mortality induced by intravenous S. aureus inoculation and the immune functions before and after bacterial inoculation. Here we show that C57Bl/6 mice on high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, like genetically obese Ob/Ob mice on low-fat diet (LFD), have increased mortality during S. aureus-induced sepsis compared with LFD-fed C57Bl/6 controls. Bacterial load in the kidneys 5–7 days after inoculation was increased 10-fold in HFD-fed compared with LFD-fed mice. At that time, HFD-fed mice had increased serum levels and fat mRNA expression of the immune suppressing cytokines interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-10 compared with LFD-fed mice. In addition, HFD-fed mice had increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory IL-1β. Also, HFD-fed mice with and without infection had increased levels of macrophages in fat. The proportion and function of phagocytosing granulocytes, and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by peritoneal lavage cells were decreased in HFD-fed compared with LFD-fed mice. Conclusions Our findings imply that chronic HFD disturb several innate immune functions in mice, and impairs the ability to clear S. aureus and survive sepsis."

MCOLN1 is an ion channel that regulates membrane transport along the endolysosomal pathway. It has been suggested that MCOLN1 participates in several Ca2+-dependent processes, including fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane, fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes, and lysosomal biogenesis. Here, we searched for proteins that interact with MCOLN1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We found that the penta-EF-hand protein ALG-2 binds to the NH-terminal cytosolic tail of MCOLN1. The interaction is direct, strictly dependent on Ca2+, and mediated by a patch of charged and hydrophobic residues located between MCOLN1 residues 37 and 49. We further show that MCOLN1 and ALG-2 co-localize to enlarged endosomes induced by overexpression of an ATPase-defective dominant-negative form of Vps4B (Vps4BE235Q). In agreement with the proposed role of MCOLN1 in the regulation of fusion/fission events, we found that overexpression of MCOLN1 caused accumulation of enlarged, aberrant endosomes that contain both early and late endosome markers. Interestingly, aggregation of abnormal endosomes was greatly reduced when the ALG-2-binding domain in MCOLN1 was mutated, suggesting that ALG-2 regulates MCOLN1 function. Overall, our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms that regulate MCOLN1 activity. We propose that ALG-2 acts as a Ca2+ sensor that modulates the function of MCOLN1 along the late endosomal-lysosomal pathway.

MCOLN1 is an ion channel that, together with MCOLN2 and MCOLN3, constitutes the TRPML subfamily within the transient receptor potential superfamily of ion channels (14.Puertollano R. Kiselyov K. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F1245-F1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MCOLN1 is a 580-amino acid protein with a predicted topology of six transmembrane-spanning domains with both amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails having a cytosolic orientation and the pore located between transmembrane segments 5 and 6. Consistent with the lysosomal defects observed in MLIV, MCOLN1 localizes to late endosomes-lysosomes via two acidic di-leucine motifs individually located near the ends of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails (15.Pryor P.R.

The accumulation of enlarged vacuolar structures observed in MLIV patients led to the suggestion that MCOLN1 may be involved in the regulation of the biogenesis of lysosomes, specifically in the reformation of lysosomes from endosome-lysosome hybrid organelles (23.Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 471-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This idea was supported by the observation that loss of the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of MCOLN1, cup-5, resulted in formation of enlarged hybrid organelles that contained both late endosomal and lysosomal markers (24.Treusch S. Knuth S. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Goldin E. Grant B.D. Fares H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4483-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). MCOLN1 has also been associated with lysosomal secretion, as fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane in response to Ca2+ was found to be impaired in MLIV cells (25.LaPlante J.M. Sun M. Falardeau J. Dai D. Brown E.M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Vassilev P.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2006; 89: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, we have proposed that MCOLN1 may play a role in the fusion of both autophagosomes and late endosomes with lysosomes (26.Vergarajauregui S. Connelly P.S. Daniels M.P. Puertollano R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2723-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).

Nature. 2008; 455: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Notably, most of the cellular processes thought to be regulated by MCOLN1 (i.e. fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes, biogenesis of lysosomes, lysosomal exocytosis, and autophagy) are processes that require Ca2+ (31.Luzio J.P.

However, most of the studies regarding this subject propose that MCOLN1 is a Ca2+-permeable channel, and the activity is regulated by changes in Ca2+ concentration on either the cytosolic or luminal face of the membrane, thus indicating that Ca2+ is an important modulator of MCOLN1 function (20.Cantiello H.F.

Furthermore, when a proline substitution was introduced into MCOLN1 to resemble the form of MCOLN3 known to cause the varitint-waddler (Va) mouse phenotype (TRPML1V432P), the resulting channel activity was inwardly rectifying, Ca2+-selective, proton-impermeable, and activated by low pH, further supporting a role for MCOLN1 as a Ca2+ channel that drives membrane fusion events within the endosomal pathway (35.Xu H.

To better understand the mechanisms that regulate MCOLN1 function, we decided to search for proteins that interact with MCOLN1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In this study, we report a Ca2+-dependent interaction between MCOLN1 and ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene-2). ALG-2 is a Ca2+-binding protein that belongs to the penta-EF-hand protein family (37.Lo K.W. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ALG-2 functions as a Ca2+-sensor by changing its conformation and hence affinities to its binding partners in a Ca2+-dependent manner (37.Lo K.W. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M.

Here, we show that ALG-2 binds to the amino-terminal tail of MCOLN1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We identified the residues in MCOLN1 responsible for this interaction and demonstrated that both proteins co-localize to endosomes. Mutation of the ALG-2-binding domain in MCOLN-1 led to defects in its distribution and function, suggesting that ALG-2 regulates MCOLN1 activity. Altogether, our data give new insight on the molecular basis for the regulation of MCOLN1 function by Ca2+. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (MBL International, Woburn, MA), rabbit anti-ALG-2 (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland), mouse anti-Sec31A (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-Hrs (Novuls Biologicals, Littleton, CO), mouse anti-CD63 (clone H5C6; Pharmingen), mouse anti-FLAGM2 (Sigma), mouse anti-His (Novagen, Madison, WI), and mouse anti-actin (Sigma). FuGENE 6 reagent and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. GST-MCOLN1-NTail and GST-MCOLN1-CTail were cloned as described previously (17.Vergarajauregui S. Oberdick R. Kiselyov K. Puertollano R. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To generate the truncated forms of GST-MCOLN1-NTail, we introduced either an EcoRI site in the corresponding 5′ site of the truncated construct and recloned it into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX51 vector or introduced a stop codon at the corresponding amino acid. To generate GFP-MCOLN1, full-length MCOLN1 was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pEGFPC2 vector (Clontech). Construction of MCOLN1-FLAG was described previously (17.Vergarajauregui S. Oberdick R. Kiselyov K. Puertollano R. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutations of residues in the cytosolic tail of MCOLN1 were introduced using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, as per the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complete open reading frame of human ALG-2 was PCR-amplified from a placenta cDNA library using specific primers and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-C2 and the Cherry-C2 vectors (Clontech) and His-Parallel vector. The point mutations at the first and third EF-hands of ALG-2 were introduced by QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit to generate pEGFP-C2-ALG2E47A/E114A. The alternatively spliced isoform of ALG-2 was constructed by deleting amino acids GF122 using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Site-directed mutations were confirmed by subsequent DNA sequencing. GFP-hVps4BE235Q was a kind gift of P. Woodman (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). HeLa and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line ARPE19 was grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 media supplemented as above. Cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were analyzed 24 h post-transfection. For ALG-2 knockdown, cells were transfected with either siRNA against ALG-2 or nontargeting siRNA using DharmaFect transfection reagent (Dharmacon-ThermoScientific, Lafayette, CO). Treated cells were lysed 72 h after transfection. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and affinity-purified by standard methods. HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer B (25 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and protease inhibitors. The lysate was precleared by centrifugation and incubated with 100 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with buffer B and transferred to a column. Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm EGTA, separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gels) under reducing conditions, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and excised from the gel. Excised bands were destained using 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile for 10-min intervals until completely destained. Gel samples were then dried, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 1 h at 56 °C, and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 45 min at room temperature in darkness. Upon supernatant removal, gels were washed with 25 mm NH4HCO3 for 10 min and with 25 mm NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile and then dried. Proteins in gels were trypsinized using 12.5 ng/μl sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted in 25 mm NH4HCO3 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were collected from digest solutions, lyophilized to near dryness, and reconstituted with 15 μl of 0.1% formic acid. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses were carried out using an Agilent 1100 nanoflow LC system (Palo Alto, CA) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA), as described previously (49.Wang G. Wu W.W. Zeng W. Chou C.L. Shen R.F. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1214-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, peptides were first loaded onto a peptide trap cartridge (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Trapped peptides were then eluted onto a reversed-phase PicoFrit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) and separated using a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–60%) in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient time was 45 min at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min. Eluted peptides from the PicoFrit column were sprayed into the LTQ mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-spray ion source. Data-dependent acquisition mode was enabled, and each survey MS scan was followed by five MS/MS scans with the dynamic exclusion option on. The spray voltage was 2 kV, and the temperature of ion transfer tube was set at 160 °C. The normalized collision energy was set at 35%. Data base search for protein identification was carried out on an 8-node computer cluster using the SEQUEST search algorithm in BioWorks 3.3 (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Human RefSeq protein sequences (target) were downloaded from the NCBI website, and a reversed version of these sequences (decoy) was appended to the target sequence data base before performing data base searches. Only the best peptide match from each MS/MS spectrum was retained for further analysis. Phospho-PIC, an in-house computer program (50.Hoffert J.D. Wang G. Pisitkun T. Shen R.F. Knepper M.A. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 3501-3508Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was applied for automated filtering of peptide identifications by XCorr scores to achieve a false discovery rate of about 5% based on the number of decoy matches. GST or GST fusion proteins (0.1 mg/ml) were incubated with recombinant His-ALG-2 in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at room temperature. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (50 μl) was added and the incubation continued for an additional 30 min. The suspension was transferred to chromatography columns, washed extensively, and fist eluted in 10 mm EGTA and then in 20 mm glutathione. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody to the His tag. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer B (25 mm Hepes, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors and subjected to pulldown analysis. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient gels) under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membrane was then blocked with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 10% nonfat milk and incubated with the indicated antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) for 10 min at −20 °C. Incubation with primary antibodies diluted in PBS, 0.1% (w/v) saponin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by rinsing with PBS for 5 min, and cells were subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody (Alexa555- or Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig) diluted in PBS, 0.1% (w/v) saponin, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30–60 min at room temperature. After a final rinse with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescence images were acquired on an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For co-localization analysis, the percentage of co-localized vesicles was calculated as the number of GFP-MCOLN1-positive vesicles that co-localized with the indicated organelle marker divided by the total number of GFP-MCOLN1-positive vesicles in a given cell and multiplied by 100. Recent evidence has suggested the participation of MCOLN1 in several Ca2+-dependent processes, including lysosomal exocytosis and fusion of autophagosomes and late endosomes with lysosomes. To better understand the mechanism of MCOLN1 function, we searched for proteins that interact with MCOLN1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The soluble proteins representing the amino-terminal tail (GST-MCOLN1-NTail; residues 1–66) and the carboxyl-terminal tail (GST-MCOLN1-CTail; residues 518–580) of MCOLN1 were synthesized in bacteria as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1A). Following purification, these fusion proteins were incubated with HeLa lysates in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. GST alone was used as a negative control. After extensively washing, proteins bound to MCOLN1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner were eluted by adding the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining. Although no noticeable bands were observed in the GST or GST-MCOLN1-CTail pulldowns, three apparent bands were eluted when using the GST-MCOLN1-NTail (Fig. 1B). The three bands were excised from the gel, trypsinized, and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Bands B1 and B2 were identified as the members of the COPII complex Sec31A and Sec13, respectively, and band B3 was identified as the penta-EF-hand protein ALG-2. To verify our mass spectrometry results, we performed Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. As expected, antibodies against Sec31A and ALG-2 detected the presence of these proteins in the eluted fractions of the GST-MCOLN1-NTail pulldowns. In contrast, no Sec31A or ALG-2 was observed in the GST-MCOLN1-CTail and GST pulldowns (Fig. 1C). The lack of a commercially available antibody against Sec13 prevented us from verifying the identity of B2 by immunoblot; however, the fact that Sec13 and Sec31A form a stable complex (51.Fath S. Mancias J.D. Bi X. Goldberg J. Cell. 2007; 129: 1325-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) suggests that the band B2 does indeed correspond to Sec13. An interaction between ALG-2 and Sec31A has been described previously (43.Yamasaki A. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4876-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 45.Shibata H. Suzuki H. Yoshida H. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

ALG-2 binds very strongly to Sec31A at the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, stabilizing the localization of Sec31A at these sites. ALG-2 also interacts with several endosomal proteins such as Alix/AIP1 (40.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R.

Acta. 2002; 1600: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for ALG-2 in the regulation of trafficking along the endosomal pathway. In addition, ALG-2 has been shown to be present at Lamp-1-enriched fractions after subcellular fractionation, further indicating an association of ALG-2 with late endosomes/lysosomes (42.Katoh K. Suzuki H. Terasawa Y. Mizuno T. Yasuda J. Shibata H. Maki M. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Given the primary location of MCOLN1 to late endosomes/lysosomes (16.Vergarajauregui S. Puertollano R. Traffic. 2006; 7: 337-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and the fact that ALG-2 is the only Ca2+-binding protein identified in the eluted fractions, we reasoned that MCOLN1 interacts with ALG-2, although the presence of Sec31A and Sec13 at the GST-MC"

Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine), a broad spectrum herbicide, is an interesting synthetic amino acid: this compound inhibits 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase in the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants and certain bacteria. In recent years, transgenic crops resistant to glyphosate were mainly generated by overproducing the plant enzyme or by introducing a 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase insensitive to this herbicide. In this work, we propose that the enzymatic oxidation of glyphosate could be an effective alternative to this important biotechnological process. To reach this goal, we used a rational design approach (together with site saturation mutagenesis) to generate a glycine oxidase variant more active on glyphosate than on the physiological substrate glycine. The glycine oxidase containing three point mutations (G51S/A54R/H244A) reaches an up to a 210-fold increase in catalytic efficiency and a 15,000-fold increase in the specificity constant (the kcat/Km ratio between glyphosate and glycine) as compared with wild-type glycine oxidase. The inspection of its three-dimensional structure shows that the α2-α3 loop (comprising residues 50–60 and containing two of the mutated residues) assumes a novel conformation and that the newly introduced residue Arg54 could be the key residue in stabilizing glyphosate binding and destabilizing glycine positioning in the binding site, thus increasing efficiency on the herbicide.

IntroductionGlycine oxidase (GO) 2The abbreviations used are: GOglycine oxidaseEPSPs5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthaseAMPAaminomethylphosphonate. from Bacillus subtilis (EC 1.4.3.19) is a flavoprotein oxidase consisting of four identical subunits; each subunit (≈42 kDa) contains one molecule of noncovalently bound FAD (1.Job V. Marcone G.L. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6985-6993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 2.Job V. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of glycine in the biosynthesis of the thiazole ring of thiamine. Its crystal structure was solved as a complex with the inhibitor glycolate up to 1.8 Å resolution (3.Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Mörtl M. Diederichs K. Welte W. Molla G. Motteran L. Andriolo G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29718-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). From a structural point of view, GO is classified as a member of the glutathione reductase family (subfamily GR2); monomeric sarcosine oxidase and d-amino acid oxidase represent closer structural neighbors (4.Mörtl M. Diederichs K. Welte W. Molla G. Motteran L. Andriolo G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29718-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GO and d-amino acid oxidase catalyze the oxidative deamination of amino acids to yield the corresponding α-imino acids and, after hydrolysis, α-keto acids, ammonia (or primary amines), and hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 1a), but they differ in substrate specificity. In addition to neutral d-amino acids (e.g. d-alanine and d-proline, which are also good substrates of d- amino acid oxidase), GO catalyzes the oxidation of primary and secondary amines (e.g. glycine, sarcosine) partially sharing substrate specificity with monomeric sarcosine oxidase (1.Job V.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 1456-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethylglycine), a broad spectrum herbicide, is an interesting synthetic amino acid. This dominant herbicide (almost 90% of crops worldwide) inhibits the monomeric enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPs), the penultimate step in the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants and certain bacteria. Glyphosate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate of EPSPs, which is more effective on the plant enzyme with respect to the bacterial homologues. The details of the structure-function relationships in EPSPs from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4 have also been elucidated (5.Funke T. Han H. Healy-Fried M.L. Fischer M. Schönbrunn E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13010-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Its efficacy against all plant species, low cost, and low mammalian toxicity impact highly favor its use in crops that have a transgenic tolerance mechanism (6.Padgette S.R. Kolacz K.H. Delannay X. Re D.B. LaVallee B.J. Tinius C.N. Rhodes W.K. Otero Y.I. Barry G.F. Eichholz D.A. Peschke V.M. Nida D.L. Taylor N.B. Kishore G.M. Crop.

The currently commercially used glyphosate-resistant mechanisms are based on the overproduction of the plant enzyme (8.Goldsbrough P.B. Hatch E.M. Huang B. Kosinski W.G. Dyer W.E. Herrmann K.M. Weller S.C. Plant Sci. 1990; 72: 53-62Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and on a transgene encoding a bacterial EPSPs that is insensitive to inhibition by glyphosate (6.Padgette S.R. Kolacz K.H.

Most recently, a transgene encoding a soil microorganism glyphosate oxidoreductase that cleaves the nitrogen-carbon bond in glyphosate yielding aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) and glyoxylate (9.Castle L.A. Siehl D.L. Gorton R. Patten P.A. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Duck N. Wong J. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10.Pline-Srnic W. Weed Technol. 2006; 20: 290-300Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the N-acetylation of the herbicide by an evolved bacterial acetyltransferase were proposed as further mechanisms for glyphosate tolerance in crops (11.Siehl D.L. Castle L.A. Gorton R. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Keenan R. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; 61: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Siehl D.L. Castle L.A. Gorton R. Keenan R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11446-11455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Currently, the only independent mechanism to give sufficient and stable resistance to glyphosate for commercialization of glyphosate-resistant crops has been glyphosate-resistant forms of EPSPs (10.Pline-Srnic W. Weed Technol. 2006; 20: 290-300Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The investigation of the crystal structure and of the substrate specificity of GO prompted us to consider this flavoenzyme as a starting point for the evolution of new functions of biotechnological interest. In particular, we report here on a protein engineering study aimed to develop the activity of GO on glyphosate with respect to glycine (the physiological substrate). We thus propose that introducing the gene coding for the evolved GO in plants is an effective alternative mechanism for glyphosate tolerance in transgenic crops. In addition, transgenic plants that are able to oxidize glyphosate may represent an innovative bioremediation system for the soil treated with this herbicide.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we describe the evolution of B. subtilis glycine oxidase to obtain an enzyme with a high catalytic efficiency on the herbicide glyphosate. First, we analyzed the substrate preference of wild-type GO, highlighting its wide substrate specificity (Fig. 1). We also demonstrated that wild-type GO oxidizes the herbicide glyphosate, which is a synthetic amino acid largely used in agriculture and which presents structural features similar to those of glycine (Scheme 1c). GO catalyzes the deaminative oxidation of glyphosate because it yields glyoxylate, AMPA, and hydrogen peroxide using 1 mol of dioxygen/1 mol of herbicide (Scheme 1b). This reaction differs from that of glyphosate oxidoreductase because of a stoichiometry of two molecules of glyphosate oxidized per molecule of oxygen and the lack of hydrogen peroxide production (9.Castle L.A. Siehl D.L. Gorton R. Patten P.A. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Duck N. Wong J. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10.Pline-Srnic W. Weed Technol. 2006; 20: 290-300Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mechanism proposed for the oxidoreductase in which the reduced flavin obtained by oxidation of the first molecule of glyphosate catalyzes the oxygenation of a second molecule of glyphosate is profoundly different from the hydride transfer mechanism proposed for GO (3.Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2971-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Mörtl M. Diederichs K. Welte W. Molla G. Motteran L. Andriolo G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29718-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The efficient oxidation of glyphosate by wild-type GO is limited by the low apparent affinity (Km,app = ≈90 mm; Table 2). To understand the putative mode of glyphosate binding at the GO active site, an in silico molecular docking analysis was carried out. In the best solutions glyphosate is bound in the same orientation inferred for its natural substrate glycine and with the phosphonate moiety pointing toward the entrance of the active site. The docking analysis identified the residues potentially involved in glyphosate binding (Fig. 2B). A number of GO variants with improved activity on glyphosate were recognized after site saturation mutagenesis on 11 positions of the active site. Finally, we combined the information gathered from the site saturation mutagenesis approach, producing a GO variant containing multiple mutations (G51S/A54R/H244A) and possessing an apparent specificity constant (the ratio between kcat/Km for the glyphosate and glycine) up to 15,000-fold higher than that for the wild-type enzyme. A total of three amino acid replacements introduced into wild-type GO suffice to provide a 13.2 kJ/mol decrease in the free energy of activation for the reaction on glyphosate and a 11.1 kJ/mol increase of the same value for the oxidation of glycine (ΔΔG values were calculated from the data in Table 2).The crystal structure of the best GO variant in complex with glycolate enables us to pinpoint structural features that affect the evolution of its substrate preference. The substitutions introduced in the evolved G51S/A54R/H244A GO appear to modify its substrate preference acting in different ways: (i) The α2-α3 loop (comprising residues 50–60 and possessing a high mobility) assumes a different conformation in the G51S/A54R/H244A variant as compared with wild-type GO. This rearrangement is mainly due to the introduction of the bulky side chain of arginine at position 54, which appears to locate close to the phosphonate group of glyphosate. This mutation replaces a neutral residue with a positively charged amino acid; new electrostatic interactions in G51S/A54R/H244A GO allow a tighter binding of the herbicide, maintaining the optimal positioning for catalysis (Fig. 4B). (ii) The introduction of arginine residue(s) at the active site entrance (positions 51 and 54) improves the kinetic efficiency of GO on glyphosate by decreasing the Km,app value (up to 20-fold in the G51R/A54R GO), whereas the maximal activity was only slightly affected (maximal change was a 2-fold increase in the G51R variant compared with the wild-type GO; Table 2). On the other hand, this substitution(s) negatively affects the protein stability; the G51R/A54R double variant shows a drastically lower stability than the wild type, and the other evolved GO variants (its activity is fully lost after 50 h of incubation at room temperature; Table 3), thus limiting its biotechnological use. Instead, the G51S/A54R/H244A GO shows stability, which is suitable for its utilization at room temperature; 60 and 70% of residual activity after 3 days at room temperature was measured for this variant and wild-type GO, respectively. (iii) The dramatic increase in specificity constant observed for the best GO variant is also due to the decrease in kinetic efficiency on glycine. This effect, too, is mainly due to a decrease in binding energy (Km,app for glycine is ≈150-fold higher in G51S/A54R/H244A than for the wild-type GO), whereas the maximal activity on glycine is only marginally altered in the evolved GO variants (Table 2). (iv) The presence of an alanine residue at position 244 only marginally affects the kinetic properties of GO when it is the only mutation introduced in the protein, but it had a synergistic effect both on the activity on glyphosate as substrate (Table 2) and the level of protein expression (supplemental Table S1) when it is introduced in the G51S/A54R GO. It appears that the smaller alanine residue at position 244 eliminates steric clashes with Glu55, for example, thus facilitating the interaction between Arg54 and glyphosate in the evolved GO variants.The observation that the same products are produced by glyphosate oxidation using GO and glyphosate oxidoreductase (i.e. AMPA and glyoxylate) might suggest a close similarity between these two FAD-containing flavoenzymes. The reaction catalyzed by the two enzymes strongly differs concerning the oxygen utilization and hydrogen peroxide production. Furthermore, the two enzymes show a low sequence identity (18.1%); a Blast analysis identifies a number of d-amino acid dehydrogenase as the most related proteins for glyphosate oxidoreductase. A further main difference is related to the kinetic properties of the two glyphosate-converting enzymes; although the apparent maximal activity reported for glyphosate oxidoreductase is not easily comparable with the value determined for GO (it was measured at higher temperature and on crude extracts, determining the amount of enzyme by means of Western blot analysis), the evolved GO we describe here shows a 5-fold lower Km for glyphosate and a kinetic efficiency (kcat/Km ratio) 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the best variant obtained for glyphosate oxidoreductase (2.1 versus 0.3 mm−1 s−1, respectively) (9.Castle L.A. Siehl D.L. Gorton R. Patten P.A. Chen Y.H. Bertain S. Cho H.J. Duck N. Wong J. Liu D. Lassner M.W. Science. 2004; 304: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10.Pline-Srnic W. Weed Technol. 2006; 20: 290-300Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This higher catalytic efficiency is most apparent when comparing recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. The specific activity in the crude extract of the evolved GO described here is 20 milliunits/mg of protein, whereas that for glyphosate oxidoreductase is ≤0.015 milliunit/mg of protein. The low level of activity observed for the oxidoreductase might explain the limitations encountered to develop commercially available crops based on this enzyme. Concerning the toxicity of GO-produced glyphosate products, AMPA has been shown to be mildly toxic to soybean (24.Hoagland R.E. Weed Sci. 1980; 28: 393-400Crossref Google Scholar, 25.Reddy K.N. Rimando A.M. Duke S.O. WSSA Abstr. 2004; 44: 116Google Scholar); this potential for toxicity has not been reported in other glyoxylate oxidoreductase-containing plants treated with glyphosate.In conclusion, our work shows that evolved GO may be a novel system for the development of glyphosate-tolerant transgenic plants and may represent an effective supplement or alternative to the transgene currently being used that is based on an EPSPs insensitive to inhibition by glyphosate. The kcat/Km of G51S/A54R/H244A GO enzyme for glyphosate is ≈2 × 103 m−1 s−1, significantly lower than diffusion-limited maximal value (109 m−1 s−1). Thus, despite the dramatic improvement in kinetic efficiency with glyphosate, GO is far from the limits of optimization. IntroductionGlycine oxidase (GO) 2The abbreviations used are: GOglycine oxidaseEPSPs5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthaseAMPAaminomethylphosphonate. from Bacillus subtilis (EC 1.4.3.19) is a flavoprotein oxidase consisting of four identical subunits; each subunit (≈42 kDa) contains one molecule of noncovalently bound FAD (1.Job V.

Its crystal structure was solved as a complex with the inhibitor glycolate up to 1.8 Å resolution (3.Settembre E.C. Dorrestein P.C. Park J.H. Augustine A.M. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E.

From a structural point of view, GO is classified as a member of the glutathione reductase family (subfamily GR2); monomeric sarcosine oxidase and d-amino acid oxidase represent closer structural neighbors (4.Mörtl M. Diederichs K. Welte W. Molla G. Motteran L. Andriolo G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29718-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GO and d-amino acid oxidase catalyze the oxidative deamination of amino acids to yield the corresponding α-imino acids and, after hydrolysis, α-keto acids, ammonia (or primary amines), and hydrogen peroxide (Scheme 1a), but they differ in substrate specificity. In addition to neutral d-amino acids (e.g. d-alanine and d-proline, which are also good substrates of d- amino acid oxidase), GO catalyzes the oxidation of primary and secondary amines (e.g. glycine, sarcosine) partially sharing substrate specificity with monomeric sarcosine oxidase (1.Job V.

This dominant herbicide (almost 90% of crops worldwide) inhibits the monomeric enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPs), the penultimate step in the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants and certain bacteria. Glyphosate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphoenolpyruvate of EPSPs, which is more effective on the plant enzyme with respect to the bacterial homologues. The details of the structure-function relationships in EPSPs from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4 have also been elucidated (5.Funke T. Han H. Healy-Fried M.L. Fischer M. Schönbrunn E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13010-13015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Its efficacy against all plant species, low cost, and low mammalian toxicity impact highly favor its use in crops that have a transgenic tolerance mechanism (6.Padgette S.R. Kolacz K.H. Delannay X.

The currently commercially used glyphosate-resistant mechanisms are based on the overproduction of the plant enzyme (8.Goldsbrough P.B. Hatch E.M. Huang B. Kosinski W.G. Dyer W.E. Herrmann K.M. Weller S.C. Plant Sci. 1990; 72: 53-62Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and on a transgene encoding a bacterial EPSPs that is insensitive to inhibition by glyphosate (6.Padgette S.R. Kolacz K.H.

Currently, the only independent mechanism to give sufficient and stable resistance to glyphosate for commercialization of glyphosate-resistant crops has been glyphosate-resistant forms of EPSPs (10.Pline-Srnic W. Weed Technol. 2006; 20: 290-300Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The investigation of the crystal structure and of the substrate specificity of GO prompted us to consider this flavoenzyme as a starting point for the evolution of new functions of biotechnological interest. In particular, we report here on a protein engineering study aimed to develop the activity of GO on glyphosate with respect to glycine (the physiological substrate). We thus propose that introducing the gene coding for the evolved GO in plants is an effective alternative mechanism for glyphosate tolerance in transgenic crops. In addition, transgenic plants that are able to oxidize glyphosate may represent an innovative bioremediation system for the soil treated with this herbicide."

This phylogenetic analysis reaffirms the identification of the NA OPXV as close relatives of “Old World” (Eurasian and African) OPXV and presents high support for deeper nodes within the Chordopoxvirinae family. The natural reservoir host(s) for many of the described OPXV species remains unknown although a clear virus-host association exists between the genus OPXV and several mammalian taxa. The hypothesized host associations and the deep divergence of the OPXV/NA OPXV clades depicted in this study may reflect the divergence patterns of the mammalian faunas of the Old and New World and reflect a more ancient presence of OPXV on what are now the American continents. Genes from the central region of the poxvirus genome are generally more conserved than genes from either end of the linear genome due to functional constraints imposed on viral replication abilities. The relatively slower evolution of these genes may more accurately reflect the deeper history among the poxvirus group, allowing for robust placement of the NA OPXV within Chordopoxvirinae. Sequence data for nine genes were compiled from three NA OPXV strains plus an additional 50 genomes collected from Genbank. The current, gene sequence based phylogenetic analysis reaffirms the identification of the NA OPXV as the nearest relatives of “Old World” OPXV and presents high support for deeper nodes within the Chordopoxvirinae family. Additionally, the substantial genetic distances that separate the currently described NA OPXV species indicate that it is likely that many more undescribed OPXV/NA OPXV species may be circulating among wild animals in North America."

IntroductionMany species of bacteria are able to sense their proximal chemical environment and move toward more favorable locations through a process known as chemotaxis. At the heart of all known bacterial chemotaxis pathways is a two-component signal transduction system involving the CheA histidine kinase and the CheY response regulator. In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the CheA kinase forms a stable complex with the chemotaxis receptors, also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), and the CheW and CheV adaptor proteins (1Szurmant H. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). When the receptors sense attractant molecules, they enhance the rate of CheA autophosphorylation, which in turn causes CheY-P concentrations to increase (2Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Borkovich K.A. Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7085-7088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Macnab R.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 5: 291-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Manson M.D. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1992; 33: 277-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the binding of CheY-P to the cytoplasmic face of the flagellum increases the likelihood of smooth runs (5Goldman D.J. Worobec S.W. Siegel R.B. Hecker R.V. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By biasing the duration and frequency of run and tumble swimming events, the bacterium is able to migrate up gradients of attractant molecules. In addition to this core signal transduction module, the B. subtilis pathway also possesses two CheY-P phosphatases and a number of regulatory proteins involved in sensory adaptation (6Szurmant H. Muff T.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21787-21792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Aizawa S.I. Zhulin I.B. Márquez-Magaña L. Ordal G.W. Sonenshein A. Losick R. Hoch J. Bacillus subtilis and Its Relatives: From Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 437-452Google Scholar). One of the remarkable features of the chemotaxis system is its ability to adapt the bacteria to their surrounding environment so that relative changes in the chemical concentrations can be sensitively detected.The chemotaxis receptors have previously been shown to be long, α-helical homodimers with multiple well defined domains, shown in Fig. 1 (8Falke J.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sensing domain is responsible for binding extracellular attractants and repellents (11Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). When bound with a ligand or intermediary binding protein, the sensing domain undergoes a conformational change that is propagated through the membrane to the HAMP (histidine kinase, adenyl cyclase, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein and phosphatase) domain (12Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then the methylation region. In B. subtilis, this methylation region interacts with the regulator proteins, CheR, CheB, and CheD, and is the site for post-translation modifications involved in sensory adaptation (8Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The distal tip of the receptors, commonly referred to as the highly conserved domain, interacts with the CheA kinase (13Park S.Y. Borbat P.P. Gonzalez-Bonet G. Bhatnagar J. Pollard A.M. Freed J.H. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A simple two-state model has been successfully used to describe the receptor complex, where attractants are thought to bias the receptor into a CheA-activating “on” state, and repellents are thought to bias it into a CheA-inhibiting “off” state. In addition to attractants and repellents, regulatory proteins, such as CheD, and covalent modifications, such as methylation and deamidation, can also alter bias between the two states (1Szurmant H. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 14Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25356-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The sensing domain of the Escherichia coli chemotaxis receptors Tar and Tsr have long served as the model for not only other bacterial chemotaxis receptors but also for two-component sensor kinases. The crystal structure of the Tar aspartate receptor revealed a four-helical bundle architecture that can bind aspartate across the dimer interface (11Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Three arginine residues (Arg-64, Arg-69, and Arg-73) are directly responsible for binding the aspartate, and mutation to any one of these residues leads to a defect in taxis toward this attractant (15Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Privé G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the apo- and holo-sensing domain structures as well as extensive cross-linking and EPR experiments have elucidated the conformational change that occurs upon aspartate binding. This change involves a vertical piston-like shift in the second trans-membrane helix (TM2), linking the sensing domain to the cytoplasmic region (8Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Ottemann K.M. Xiao W. Shin Y.K. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Recent work in B. subtilis has shown that a different mechanism, a rotation of the first trans-membrane helix (TM1) without a piston movement, occurs upon attractant binding, illustrating a fundamental difference in the mechanism for receptor activation in these two species (18Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cho S.H. Ordal G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The sensing domains for the canonical B. subtilis receptors McpA, McpB, and McpC do not share any homology with corresponding domains for the E. coli chemotaxis receptors, as shown in the alignment in Fig. 2. Rather, a Cache (Ca2+ channels and chemotaxis receptors) domain is found as the core ligand-binding element in McpA, McpB, and McpC (19Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This domain is not found in the E. coli chemotaxis receptors, providing further evidence that there is a fundamental structural difference between the E. coli and B. subtilis sensing domains. Further analysis of the Cache domain also revealed the possible presence of a structural PAS (named after the Period circadian, Ah receptor nuclear translocator and Single-minded proteins) domain and identified a conserved histidine residue as possibly being important for function (19Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, genomic sequence analysis revealed that the E. coli four-helix bundle, initially defined in the Tar sensing domain, was not conserved in the chemotaxis receptors of many Gram-positive organisms, including the B. subtilis receptors McpA and McpB (20Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: iii45-iii48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to these studies, recent structures of the periplasmic binding domains of both the Klebsiella pneumoniae CitA citrate sensor and the E. coli DcuS fumarate sensor showed that an extracellular PAS domain was involved in ligand binding for these two-component sensor kinases (21Reinelt S.

Finally, the crystal structures of the Vibrio harveyi LuxQ sensor kinase sensing domain (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M.

Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the sensing domain of the V. cholerae McpN chemoreceptor (Protein Data Bank code 3C8C) revealed a novel architecture for the sensing domains of both bacterial two-component sensor kinases and chemoreceptors. These crystal structures revealed a dual PAS domain architecture and suggest that this architecture is a more common sensing module than the E. coli four-helical bundle.FIGURE 2Sequence alignments of chemoreceptor sensing domains.

Vc, V. cholerae; Bs, B. subtilis; Ec, E. coli.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This current study aims to elucidate the architecture of the sensing domain of the asparagine receptor McpB. In particular, current evidence suggests that the sensing domain of the B. subtilis chemotaxis receptors has a different architecture than that of the E. coli chemotaxis receptors. The lack of a crystal structure for the McpB sensing domain led to the development of a homology-based structural model for this domain. This model predicts that a dual PAS domain structure is found in the McpB sensing domain as well as in other B. subtilis chemoreceptors. Furthermore, mutational analysis reveals the residues that are important for ligand binding and overall chemotactic ability and, thus, provides support for this structural model of the McpB sensing domain.DISCUSSIONBacterial chemoreceptors are essential for the sensing of external ligands and initiating the associated two-component signal transduction cascade. Extensive work in E. coli and S. typhimurium has elucidated the structure and function of the chemoreceptor sensing domain, and the four-helical bundle was long thought to be the paradigm of not only bacterial chemoreceptors but also other two-component sensor kinase sensing domains (11Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, recent work on CitA, DcuS, and DctB has revealed a different sensing architecture, namely small ligand binding to a PAS domain (21Reinelt S. Hofmann E. Gerharz T. Bott M. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39189-39196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Cheung J. Hendrickson W.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2008; 383: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The sensing domain of the B. subtilis chemoreceptors seems to be vastly different from that of the E. coli chemotaxis receptor, as first revealed by sequence analysis (19Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: iii45-iii48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The data presented here showed that a dual PAS domain structure is, most likely, the functional fold of the McpB sensing domain, quite unlike the Tar four-helix bundle. Although no crystal structure of a B. subtilis sensing domain is yet available, the B. subtilis sensing domains were found to be easy targets for all three modeling programs, indicating a high probability of an accurate homology-based model (37Bennett-Lovsey R.M. Herbert A.D. Sternberg M.J. Kelley L.A. Proteins. 2008; 70: 611-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 38Wu S. Zhang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3375-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 39Zhang Y. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008; 9: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). The in vivo sensitivity assays and in vitro ITC experiments further verified the modeling results, because the putative asparagine-binding residues predicted by these models showed an effect on amino acid binding and chemotaxis. The ITC experiments performed here showed, for the first time, that the B. subtilis receptor McpB can directly bind an amino acid ligand. Finally, circular dichroism spectra correlated very well to the predicted structure and showed that point mutations in the sensing domain do not affect the secondary structure.In the McpB receptor sensing domain, the Arg-111 and Tyr-133 residues seemed to play a very important role in binding the asparagine ligand. The sensitivity capillary assays and the ITC experiments both showed that an McpB receptor with one of these residues mutated to an alanine had a drastically lower affinity for asparagine. The third residue that has an effect on binding is Tyr-121, although it is not nearly as dramatic of an effect as Arg-111 and Tyr-133.Capillary assays performed on E. coli Tar mutants in which one of the three arginine residues responsible for ligand binding were mutated showed a decrease in sensitivity of 2–3 orders of magnitude (46Björkman A.M. Dunten P. Sandgren M.O. Dwarakanath V.N. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2808-2815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 47Wolff C. Parkinson J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4509-4515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro assays, using a coupled methylation system that examines receptor methylation after ligand binding, showed an increase in KD from 3 μm to 35 mm when one of the arginine residues is mutated, with the R64A mutation having the most drastic effect (46Björkman A.M. Dunten P. Sandgren M.O. Dwarakanath V.N. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2808-2815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments on the E. coli Tsr receptor, using serine as a ligand, show a KD of 27 μm, similar to the range of binding found in the McpB receptor (48Lin L.N. Li J. Brandts J.F. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6564-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The B. subtilis and E. coli receptors show a similar range of attractant sensing, so it is not surprising that the results presented here are similar to data generated for the E. coli receptors.The Tar receptor, as well as the CitA and DctB sensors, has key residues present in the binding pocket that can hydrogen-bond with the ligand (15Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Privé G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 21Reinelt S. Hofmann E. Gerharz T. Bott M. Madden D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39189-39196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Assuming the B. subtilis sensing domains use a similar mechanism, it is possible that both Arg-111 and Tyr-121 may be able to hydrogen-bond with the asparagine ligand. When one of these residues is mutated to an alanine, a residue that would not be able to form a hydrogen bond with the ligand, the sensitivity of the receptor decreases. It then takes a higher concentration of asparagine to get the receptor into an active conformation, which is why there was a shift in the apparent dissociation constant.The Tyr-133 residue in the McpB sensing domain may play a different role in asparagine binding. McpB(Y133A) showed a similar phenotype to mcpB(R111A) in every experiment. The Tyr-133 residue was also mutated to a phenylalanine to determine if the -OH group on the tyrosine residue or its inherent bulk facilitated asparagine binding. Chemotactic activity, as well as asparagine binding, seemed to be normal in McpB(Y133F), suggesting that the size of the tyrosine residue was important in asparagine binding, not possible hydrogen-bonding with the -OH group.All of the other mutants of the McpB sensing domain studied did not show any impact on chemotaxis, suggesting that they do not play a role in asparagine binding. These results showed that the lower PAS domain, which includes the Cache domain conserved Phe-205, Ile-206, and His-216, did not appear to bind asparagine. The most plausible conclusion is that only the upper PAS domain is responsible for ligand binding in the B. subtilis McpB chemoreceptor, similar to small ligand binding in both the McpN and DctB structures (25Cheung J. Hendrickson W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 30256-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Zhou Y.F. Nan B. Nan J. Ma Q. Panjikar S. Liang Y.H. Wang Y. Su X.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 3C8C).The McpN sensing domain structure was solved as a homodimer, and dimerization was shown to be similar to the LuxQ sensor domain (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2006; 126: 1095-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 3C8C). Probably, the sensing regions of the B. subtilis chemoreceptors dimerize in a similar fashion. This mode of dimerization, along the long α-helix at the amino terminus of the sensing domain following TM1, would orient the PAS domains outward. Such an orientation would facilitate ligand binding and is important in the LuxQ dimer and its interactions with LuxP as well (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2006; 126: 1095-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This structure shows the possibility of the B. subtilis sensing domain being conserved throughout many two-component chemoreceptors, much more widely than the E. coli chemoreceptor four-helix bundle, as has been postulated by others (20Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: iii45-iii48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 49Szurmant H. White R.A. Hoch J.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The importance of the ligand-binding event in the membrane-exterior domain of the chemoreceptor is that it stabilizes an allosteric conformation of the chemoreceptor in which CheA, bound to a very distant helical loop (the highly conserved domain), is very active. In E. coli, an inactivating conformational shift upon ligand binding is thought to involve a piston-like movement of the TM2 helix (8Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the McpB structural model presented here, the TM2 helix comes after the lower PAS domain in the protein sequence. In B. subtilis, no such piston shift has been found. Instead, TM1 is the helix that moves, as shown by disulfide cross-linking experiments, and that movement is a rotation of the helix (18Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cho S.H. Ordal G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 50Rao C.V. Glekas G.D. Ordal G.W. Trends Microbiol. 2008; 16: 480-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ligand binds within a monomer, in the upper PAS domain, not across the dimeric surface as in the E. coli receptors (11Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar).The LuxQ crystal structure provided an even clearer picture of the mechanism of activation of this type of two-component sensor. The LuxQ dimer has been crystallized with its binding partner, LuxP, in both the apo and bound forms (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2006; 126: 1095-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 27Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Miller S.T. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). LuxP senses the extracellular molecule AI-2, which mediates quorum sensing in many bacterial species. Upon binding AI-2, LuxP was shown to induce a global conformational change in the LuxQ dimer by binding sites in the LuxQ PAS domains, resulting in a 140° rotation of one of the LuxQ domains in the dimer (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2006; 126: 1095-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This rotation produces an asymmetry in the quaternary structure of the LuxQ dimer, which induces kinase activation (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2006; 126: 1095-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 862-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although the binding of a small molecule might not produce such a dramatic rotation in the B. subtilis receptors, any perturbation in the symmetry of the sensing domain dimer upon ligand binding may result in chemoreceptor activation.Additional work in LuxQ showed that mutations at the top or bottom of the long dimerization helix could produce a severe phenotype in which the kinase is constitutively activated (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M. Cell. 2006; 126: 1095-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). If the ligand is binding in the upper PAS domain in the sensing domains of McpB, it is possible that it could change the dimerization helix, which is attached to TM1. This movement could possibly be responsible for affecting the TM1-TM1′ interactions and might lead to kinase activation. Such a model would also explain why, upon attractant sensing, movement is seen only in TM1 of the McpB receptor, not in TM2 as in E. coli.Obviously, much more work is needed to examine these possibilities. However, binding of a ligand to the upper PAS domain could fit into a model of TM1 movement being responsible for chemotactic activation in B. subtilis and possibly other organisms. Further structural insight into the B. subtilis sensing domain and the possible effects of ligand binding would lead to a much better understanding of the mechanism of chemoreceptor activation. IntroductionMany species of bacteria are able to sense their proximal chemical environment and move toward more favorable locations through a process known as chemotaxis. At the heart of all known bacterial chemotaxis pathways is a two-component signal transduction system involving the CheA histidine kinase and the CheY response regulator. In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the CheA kinase forms a stable complex with the chemotaxis receptors, also known as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs), and the CheW and CheV adaptor proteins (1Szurmant H. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). When the receptors sense attractant molecules, they enhance the rate of CheA autophosphorylation, which in turn causes CheY-P concentrations to increase (2Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Borkovich K.A. Pakula A.A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7085-7088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Macnab R.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 5: 291-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Manson M.D. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1992; 33: 277-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the binding of CheY-P to the cytoplasmic face of the flagellum increases the likelihood of smooth runs (5Goldman D.J. Worobec S.W. Siegel R.B. Hecker R.V. Ordal G.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By biasing the duration and frequency of run and tumble swimming events, the bacterium is able to migrate up gradients of attractant molecules. In addition to this core signal transduction module, the B. subtilis pathway also possesses two CheY-P phosphatases and a number of regulatory proteins involved in sensory adaptation (6Szurmant H. Muff T.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21787-21792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Aizawa S.I. Zhulin I.B. Márquez-Magaña L. Ordal G.W. Sonenshein A. Losick R. Hoch J. Bacillus subtilis and Its Relatives: From Genes to Cells. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2001: 437-452Google Scholar). One of the remarkable features of the chemotaxis system is its ability to adapt the bacteria to their surrounding environment so that relative changes in the chemical concentrations can be sensitively detected.The chemotaxis receptors have previously been shown to be long, α-helical homodimers with multiple well defined domains, shown in Fig. 1 (8Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 9Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17966-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sensing domain is responsible for binding extracellular attractants and repellents (11Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). When bound with a ligand or intermediary binding protein, the sensing domain undergoes a conformational change that is propagated through the membrane to the HAMP (histidine kinase, adenyl cyclase, methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein and phosphatase) domain (12Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then the methylation region. In B. subtilis, this methylation region interacts with the regulator proteins, CheR, CheB, and CheD, and is the site for post-translation modifications involved in sensory adaptation (8Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The distal tip of the receptors, commonly referred to as the highly conserved domain, interacts with the CheA kinase (13Park S.Y. Borbat P.P. Gonzalez-Bonet G. Bhatnagar J. Pollard A.M. Freed J.H. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A simple two-state model has been successfully used to describe the receptor complex, where attractants are thought to bias the receptor into a CheA-activating “on” state, and repellents are thought to bias it into a CheA-inhibiting “off” state. In addition to attractants and repellents, regulatory proteins, such as CheD, and covalent modifications, such as methylation and deamidation, can also alter bias between the two states (1Szurmant H. Ordal G.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 14Kristich C.J. Ordal G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25356-25362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).The sensing domain of the Escherichia coli chemotaxis receptors Tar and Tsr have long served as the model for not only other bacterial chemotaxis receptors but also for two-component sensor kinases. The crystal structure of the Tar aspartate receptor revealed a four-helical bundle architecture that can bind aspartate across the dimer interface (11Milburn M.V. Privé G.G. Milligan D.L. Scott W.G. Yeh J. Jancarik J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. Science. 1991; 254: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Three arginine residues (Arg-64, Arg-69, and Arg-73) are directly responsible for binding the aspartate, and mutation to any one of these residues leads to a defect in taxis toward this attractant (15Yeh J.I. Biemann H.P. Privé G.G. Pandit J. Koshland Jr., D.E. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 186-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the apo- and holo-sensing domain structures as well as extensive cross-linking and EPR experiments have elucidated the conformational change that occurs upon aspartate binding. This change involves a vertical piston-like shift in the second trans-membrane helix (TM2), linking the sensing domain to the cytoplasmic region (8Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Ottemann K.M. Xiao W. Shin Y.K. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Recent work in B. subtilis has shown that a different mechanism, a rotation of the first trans-membrane helix (TM1) without a piston movement, occurs upon attractant binding, illustrating a fundamental difference in the mechanism for receptor activation in these two species (18Szurmant H. Bunn M.W. Cho S.H. Ordal G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The sensing domains for the canonical B. subtilis receptors McpA, McpB, and McpC do not share any homology with corresponding domains for the E. coli chemotaxis receptors, as shown in the alignment in Fig. 2. Rather, a Cache (Ca2+ channels and chemotaxis receptors) domain is found as the core ligand-binding element in McpA, McpB, and McpC (19Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This domain is not found in the E. coli chemotaxis receptors, providing further evidence that there is a fundamental structural difference between the E. coli and B. subtilis sensing domains. Further analysis of the Cache domain also revealed the possible presence of a structural PAS (named after the Period circadian, Ah receptor nuclear translocator and Single-minded proteins) domain and identified a conserved histidine residue as possibly being important for function (19Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 535-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, genomic sequence analysis revealed that the E. coli four-helix bundle, initially defined in the Tar sensing domain, was not conserved in the chemotaxis receptors of many Gram-positive organisms, including the B. subtilis receptors McpA and McpB (20Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: iii45-iii48Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to these studies, recent structures of the periplasmic binding domains of both the Klebsiella pneumoniae CitA citrate sensor and the E. coli DcuS fumarate sensor showed that an extracellular PAS domain was involved in ligand binding for these two-component sensor kinases (21Reinelt S.

Finally, the crystal structures of the Vibrio harveyi LuxQ sensor kinase sensing domain (23Neiditch M.B. Federle M.J. Pompeani A.J. Kelly R.C. Swem D.L. Jeffrey P.D. Bassler B.L. Hughson F.M.

Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the sensing domain of the V. cholerae McpN chemoreceptor (Protein Data Bank code 3C8C) revealed a novel architecture for the sensing domains of both bacterial two-component sensor kinases and chemoreceptors. These crystal structures revealed a dual PAS domain architecture and suggest that this architecture is a more common sensing module than the E. coli four-helical bundle.This current study aims to elucidate the architecture of the sensing domain of the asparagine receptor McpB. In particular, current evidence suggests that the sensing domain of the B. subtilis chemotaxis receptors has a different architecture than that of the E. coli chemotaxis receptors. The lack of a crystal structure for the McpB sensing domain led to the development of a homology-based structural model for this domain. This model predicts that a dual PAS domain structure is found in the McpB sensing domain as well as in other B. subtilis chemoreceptors. Furthermore, mutational analysis reveals the residues that are important for ligand binding and overall chemotactic ability and, thus, provides support for this structural model of the McpB sensing domain."
https://openalex.org/W2084132126,"Background Recent findings suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological features (neuritic plaques and NFTs) are not strongly associated with dementia in extreme old (over 90 years of age) and compel a search for neurobiological indices of dementia in this rapidly growing segment of the elderly population. We sought to characterize transcriptional and protein profiles of dementia in the oldest-old. Methods and Findings Gene and protein expression changes relative to non-demented age-matched controls were assessed by two microarray platforms, qPCR and Western blot in different regions of the brains of oldest-old and younger old persons who died at mild or severe stages of dementia. Our results indicate that: i) consistent with recent neuropathological findings, gene expression changes associated with cognitive impairment in oldest-old persons are distinct from those in cognitively impaired youngest-old persons; ii) transcripts affected in young-old subjects with dementia participate in biological pathways related to synaptic function and neurotransmission while transcripts affected in oldest-old subjects with dementia are associated with immune/inflammatory function; iii) upregulation of immune response genes in cognitively intact oldest-old subjects and their subsequent downregulation in dementia suggests a potential protective role of the brain immune-associated system against dementia in the oldest-old; iv) consistent with gene expression profiles, protein expression of several selected genes associated with the inflammatory/immune system in inferior temporal cortex is significantly increased in cognitively intact oldest-old persons relative to cognitively intact young-old persons, but impaired in cognitively compromised oldest-old persons relative to cognitively intact oldest-old controls. Conclusions These results suggest that disruption of the robust immune homeostasis that is characteristic of oldest-old individuals who avoided dementia may be directly associated with dementia in the oldest-old and contrast with the synaptic and neurotransmitter system failures that typify dementia in younger old persons."

https://openalex.org/W2017211141,"We previously reported that Dot1a.AF9 complex represses transcription of the epithelial Na(+) channel subunit alpha (alpha-ENaC) gene in mouse inner medullary collecting duct mIMCD3 cells and mouse kidney. Aldosterone relieves this repression by down-regulating the complex through various mechanisms. Whether these mechanisms are sufficient and conserved in human cells or can be applied to other aldosterone-regulated genes remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that human embryonic kidney 293T cells express the three ENaC subunits and all of the ENaC transcriptional regulators examined. These cells respond to aldosterone and display benzamil-sensitive Na(+) currents, as measured by whole-cell patch clamping. We also show that AF17 and AF9 competitively bind to the same domain of Dot1a in multiple assays and have antagonistic effects on expression of an alpha-ENaC promoter-luciferase construct. Overexpression of Dot1a or AF9 decreased mRNA expression of the ENaC subunits and their transcriptional regulators and reduced benzamil-sensitive Na(+) currents. AF17 overexpression caused the opposite effects, accompanied by redirection of Dot1a from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and reduction in histone H3 K79 methylation. The nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B blocked the effect of AF17 overexpression on H3 K79 hypomethylation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AF17 yielded nuclear enrichment of Dot1a and histone H3 K79 hypermethylation. As with AF9, AF17 displays nuclear and cytoplasmic co-localization with Sgk1. Therefore, AF17 competes with AF9 to bind Dot1a, decreases Dot1a nuclear expression by possibly facilitating its nuclear export, and relieves Dot1a.AF9-mediated repression of alpha-ENaC and other target genes."
https://openalex.org/W1994379399,"Alcadeins (Alcs) constitute a family of neuronal type I membrane proteins, designated Alcα, Alcβ, and Alcγ. The Alcs express in neurons dominantly and largely colocalize with the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain. Alcs and APP show an identical function as a cargo receptor of kinesin-1. Moreover, proteolytic processing of Alc proteins appears highly similar to that of APP. We found that APP α-secretases ADAM 10 and ADAM 17 primarily cleave Alc proteins and trigger the subsequent secondary intramembranous cleavage of Alc C-terminal fragments by a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase complex, thereby generating “APP p3-like” and non-aggregative Alc peptides (p3-Alcs). We determined the complete amino acid sequence of p3-Alcα, p3-Alcβ, and p3-Alcγ, whose major species comprise 35, 37, and 31 amino acids, respectively, in human cerebrospinal fluid. We demonstrate here that variant p3-Alc C termini are modulated by FAD-linked presenilin 1 mutations increasing minor β-amyloid species Aβ42, and these mutations alter the level of minor p3-Alc species. However, the magnitudes of C-terminal alteration of p3-Alcα, p3-Alcβ, and p3-Alcγ were not equivalent, suggesting that one type of γ-secretase dysfunction does not appear in the phenotype equivalently in the cleavage of type I membrane proteins. Because these C-terminal alterations are detectable in human cerebrospinal fluid, the use of a substrate panel, including Alcs and APP, may be effective to detect γ-secretase dysfunction in the prepathogenic state of Alzheimer disease subjects. Alcadeins (Alcs) constitute a family of neuronal type I membrane proteins, designated Alcα, Alcβ, and Alcγ. The Alcs express in neurons dominantly and largely colocalize with the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain. Alcs and APP show an identical function as a cargo receptor of kinesin-1. Moreover, proteolytic processing of Alc proteins appears highly similar to that of APP. We found that APP α-secretases ADAM 10 and ADAM 17 primarily cleave Alc proteins and trigger the subsequent secondary intramembranous cleavage of Alc C-terminal fragments by a presenilin-dependent γ-secretase complex, thereby generating “APP p3-like” and non-aggregative Alc peptides (p3-Alcs). We determined the complete amino acid sequence of p3-Alcα, p3-Alcβ, and p3-Alcγ, whose major species comprise 35, 37, and 31 amino acids, respectively, in human cerebrospinal fluid. We demonstrate here that variant p3-Alc C termini are modulated by FAD-linked presenilin 1 mutations increasing minor β-amyloid species Aβ42, and these mutations alter the level of minor p3-Alc species. However, the magnitudes of C-terminal alteration of p3-Alcα, p3-Alcβ, and p3-Alcγ were not equivalent, suggesting that one type of γ-secretase dysfunction does not appear in the phenotype equivalently in the cleavage of type I membrane proteins. Because these C-terminal alterations are detectable in human cerebrospinal fluid, the use of a substrate panel, including Alcs and APP, may be effective to detect γ-secretase dysfunction in the prepathogenic state of Alzheimer disease subjects.

Thus, Alc plays important roles in vesicular transport at the subcellular level and in learning behavior at the organismal level. Alc exists as four isoforms in mammals: Alcα1 (971 amino acids in humans), Alcα2 (981 amino acids in humans), Alcβ (956 amino acids in humans), and Alcγ (955 amino acids in humans) (1.Araki Y.

Alcα, Alcβ, and Alcγ are encoded by independent genes, whereas Alcα1 and Alcα2 are splice variants derived from the Alcα gene.In neurons, Alc proteins are complexed to X11L molecules, which, in turn, are complexed with the amyloid β-precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane protein that is believed to play a seminal role in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic Alzheimer disease (reviewed for AD in Refs. 7.Selkoe D.J.

Subsequent cleavage of the remaining Alc C-terminal fragments involves the presenilin-1 (PS1)-dependent γ-secretase, and this reaction liberates into cell-conditioned medium and into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a short peptide, p3-Alc, previously designated “β-Alc.” Our other analysis using CSF from three groups of human subjects (n = 158) indicates that p3-Alcα variant ratio (minor p3-Alcα38/major p3-Alcα35) correlated with the Aβ42/40 ratio in the sporadic AD (clinical dementia rating 0.5 + 1 patients) but not elderly non-demented and other neurological disease controls. 6S.

Holtzman, T. Yamamoto, T. Nakaya, S. Gandy, and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. Therefore, the detailed biochemical analysis for the cleavages of Alc proteins is significant for understanding the features of p3-Alc peptides in human subjects. We found that various FAD-linked PS1 mutations appeared, at different magnitudes, with the alterations of C termini of p3-Alcs, suggesting that one type of γ-secretase dysfunction appears in various phenotypes upon cleavage of Alc proteins and APP. In other words, one type of γ-secretase dysfunction largely alters the cleavage of one Alc species and APP, but the same dysfunction slightly alters the cleavage of another Alc species. When the cleavage phenotypes appear on APP to increase pathogenic Aβ42, the subject may experience the onset of AD. Testing the hypothesis that AD-related variant processing of p3-Alc peptide might yield surrogate markers for γ-secretase dysfunction is important. In this study, we characterized all p3-Alc species generated from Alcα, Alcβ, and Alcγ in detail.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that the Alc family proteins Alcα, Alcβ, and Alcγ are cleaved by APP α-secretases ADAM 10 and ADAM 17. Alc is expressed largely in neurons (1.Araki Y. Tomita S. Yamaguchi H. Miyagi N. Sumioka A. Kirino Y. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49448-49458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); therefore, ADAM 10 is thought to be the most likely candidate for Alc cleavage in the central nervous system because ADAM 17 is predominantly expressed in glial cells (22.Goddard D.R. Bunning R.A. Woodroofe M.N. Glia. 2001; 34: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, in neurons, Alc and APP are primarily cleaved by the same enzymes when both proteins are liberated from their individual or coordinated complexes with X11L. These results agree with our previous report that APP and Alc are likely to be metabolized in a coordinated fashion (12.Araki Y. Miyagi N. Kato N. Yoshida T. Wada S. Nishimura M. Komano H. Yamamoto T. De Strooper B. Yamamoto K. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24343-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although APP is also cleaved by BACE, Alc proteins are not likely to be major substrates for this enzyme (supplemental Fig. S4).In addition to the similar mechanisms regulating the primary cleavage of Alc family proteins and APP, we also found that Alc family proteins are cleaved by the same γ-secretase complex as is APP (12.Araki Y. Miyagi N. Kato N. Yoshida T. Wada S. Nishimura M. Komano H. Yamamoto T. De Strooper B. Yamamoto K. Suzuki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24343-24354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that p3-Alc species with altered C termini are secreted together with the increased ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 by cells expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutants, although the magnitude of alteration was diversified among Alc family proteins in cells expressing various FAD-linked PS1 mutants. p3-Alc species are not prone to aggregation 7Y. Araki and N. Takei, unpublished observations. and are detectable in human CSF; this raises the possibility that some p3-Alc changes in the pathological state might serve in clinical situations as markers of variant protein processing by the dysfunction of γ-secretase.In the cell culture experiments, we observed that wild type and several pathogenic PS1 mutants modulated p3-Alcα, p-3-Alcβ, and p3-Alcγ C-terminal speciation at various magnitudes. This indicates that APP is not the only γ-secretase substrate that undergoes variant processing in association with PS1 mutations and suggests that some of the PS1 mutations caused more alteration in the cleavage of Alc protein(s) than APP and vice versa.In studies with cells expressing FAD-linked PS1 mutant, a covariance was observed when Aβ42/40 and certain variant p3-Alc minor/major species ratios, such as p3-Alcα2N+38/p3-Alcα2N+35 or p3-Alcγ34/p3-Alcγ31, were plotted against each other (Fig. 4B). We observed similar phenomena in the CSF of subjects with sporadic AD, in that there existed disease-related covariant signature relationships between p3-Alcα38/p3-Alcα35 ratios and Aβ42/40 ratios. 6S.

Holtzman, T. Yamamoto, T. Nakaya, S. Gandy, and T. Suzuki, submitted for publication. In the case of p3-Alcα38/35 ratios, the covariant signature showed a positive slope in AD subjects, whereas the signatures of both the aged non-demented control subjects and the other neurological disease control subjects were similar to each other and negative in slope, suggesting a pathogenic malfunction of the γ-secretase complex in sporadic AD patients, 6S.

Suzuki, submitted for publication. as observed in a pathogenic state of FAD-linked PS mutations in this study (Fig. 4B).The biophysical mechanisms by which pathogenic PS1 mutations exert their effects are poorly understood, and it is unclear how p3-Alc ratios from the CSF of humans who do not harbor PS1 mutations are altered, as can be seen in this study with FAD-linked PS1 mutant. It is possible that wild type PS1 is behaving as if a PS1 mutation were present as a result of changes in some co-factors that modulate γ-secretase function, a result of the conformational changes of PS1, and/or a result of peripheral environmental changes at the place that γ-secretase is active. Therefore, the present results suggest that qualitative changes of p3-Alc species with altered C termini may be useful in diagnosing dysfunction of γ-secretase prior to the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer disease. Taking these findings together with those of another study of human subjects, 6S. Hata, S. Fujishige, Y. Araki, M. Taniguchi, K. Urakami, E. Peskind, H. Akatsu, M. Araseki, R. Martins, M. Maeda, A.

Suzuki, submitted for publication. we propose a hypothesis that γ-secretase dysfunction may be a feature of the pathogenesis in some population of common sporadic AD and that measurement of unusual p3-Alc fragments may provide surrogate markers to detect clinical γ-secretase dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W1975207528,"In the developing nervous system, distribution of membrane molecules, particularly axon guidance receptors, is often restricted to specific segments of axons. Such localization of membrane molecules can be important for the formation and function of neural networks; however, how this patterning within axons is achieved remains elusive. Here we show that Drosophila neurons in culture establish intra-axonal patterns in a cell-autonomous manner; several membrane molecules localize to either proximal or distal axon segments without cell-cell contacts. This distinct patterning of membrane proteins is not explained by a simple temporal control of expression, and likely involves spatially controlled vesicular targeting or retrieval. Mobility of transmembrane molecules is restricted at the boundary of intra-axonal segments, indicating that the axonal membrane is compartmentalized by a barrier mechanism. We propose that this intra-axonal compartmentalization is an intrinsic property of Drosophila neurons that provides a basis for the structural and functional development of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2076638341,"p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) is a downstream effector of the mTOR signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation, cell growth, cell-cycle progression, and glucose homeostasis. Multiple phosphorylation events within the catalytic, autoinhibitory, and hydrophobic motif domains contribute to the regulation of p70S6K. We report the crystal structures of the kinase domain of p70S6K1 bound to staurosporine in both the unphosphorylated state and in the 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1-phosphorylated state in which Thr-252 of the activation loop is phosphorylated. Unphosphorylated p70S6K1 exists in two crystal forms, one in which the p70S6K1 kinase domain exists as a monomer and the other as a domain-swapped dimer. The crystal structure of the partially activated kinase domain that is phosphorylated within the activation loop reveals conformational ordering of the activation loop that is consistent with a role in activation. The structures offer insights into the structural basis of the 3'-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1-induced activation of p70S6K and provide a platform for the rational structure-guided design of specific p70S6K inhibitors."

Herein, we demonstrate that Spry1 and Spry2, but not Spry3 or Spry4, associate with the HECT domain family E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4. The Spry2/Nedd4 association involves the WW domains of Nedd4 and requires phosphorylation of the Mnk2 kinase sites, Ser(112) and Ser(121), on Spry2. The phospho-Ser(112/121) region on Spry2 that binds WW domains of Nedd4 is a novel non-canonical WW domain binding region that does not contain Pro residues after phospho-Ser. Endogenous and overexpressed Nedd4 polyubiquitinate Spry2 via Lys(48) on ubiquitin and decrease its stability. Silencing of endogenous Nedd4 increased the cellular Spry2 content and attenuated fibroblast growth factor-elicited ERK1/2 activation that was reversed when elevations in Spry2 levels were prevented by Spry2-specific small interfering RNA. Mnk2 silencing decreased Spry2-Nedd4 interactions and also augmented the ability of Spry2 to inhibit fibroblast growth factor signaling. This is the first report demonstrating the regulation of cellular Spry content and its ability to modulate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2062128157,"The identification of new biomarkers is of high interest for the prediction of the disease course and also for the identification of pathomechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS). To specify markers of the chronic disease phase, we performed proteome profiling during the later phase of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG-EAE, day 35 after immunization) as a model disease mimicking many aspects of secondary progressive MS. In comparison to healthy controls, high resolution 2 dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed a number of regulated proteins, among them glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP). Phase specific up-regulation of GFAP in chronic EAE was confirmed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Protein levels of GFAP were also increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients with specificity for the secondary progressive disease phase. In a next step, proteome profiling of an EAE model with enhanced degenerative mechanisms revealed regulation of alpha-internexin, syntaxin binding protein 1, annexin V and glutamate decarboxylase in the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) knockout mouse. The identification of these proteins implicate an increased apoptosis and enhanced axonal disintegration and correlate well the described pattern of tissue injury in CNTF −/− mice which involve oligodendrocyte (OL) apoptosis and axonal injury. In summary, our findings underscore the value of proteome analyses as screening method for stage specific biomarkers and for the identification of new culprits for tissue damage in chronic autoimmune demyelination."
https://openalex.org/W1977416953,"Escherichia coli MutT hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP, an event that can prevent the misincorporation of 8-oxoguanine opposite adenine in DNA. Of the several enzymes that recognize 8-oxoguanine, MutT exhibits high substrate specificity for 8-oxoguanine nucleotides; however, the structural basis for this specificity is unknown. The crystal structures of MutT in the apo and holo forms and in the binary and ternary forms complexed with the product 8-oxo-dGMP and 8-oxo-dGMP plus Mn(2+), respectively, were determined. MutT strictly recognizes the overall conformation of 8-oxo-dGMP through a number of hydrogen bonds. This recognition mode revealed that 8-oxoguanine nucleotides are discriminated from guanine nucleotides by not only the hydrogen bond between the N7-H and Odelta (N119) atoms but also by the syn glycosidic conformation that 8-oxoguanine nucleotides prefer. Nevertheless, these discrimination factors cannot by themselves explain the roughly 34,000-fold difference between the affinity of MutT for 8-oxo-dGMP and dGMP. When the binary complex of MutT with 8-oxo-dGMP is compared with the ligand-free form, ordering and considerable movement of the flexible loops surrounding 8-oxo-dGMP in the binary complex are observed. These results indicate that MutT specifically recognizes 8-oxoguanine nucleotides by the ligand-induced conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1970792897,"Coenzyme B(12) is used by two highly similar radical enzymes, which catalyze carbon skeleton rearrangements, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and isobutyryl-CoA mutase (ICM). ICM catalyzes the reversible interconversion of isobutyryl-CoA and n-butyryl-CoA and exists as a heterotetramer. In this study, we have identified >70 bacterial proteins, which represent fusions between the subunits of ICM and a P-loop GTPase and are currently misannotated as methylmalonyl-CoA mutases. We designate this fusion protein as IcmF (isobutyryl-CoA mutase fused). All IcmFs are composed of the following three domains: the N-terminal 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin binding region that is homologous to the small subunit of ICM (IcmB), a middle P-loop GTPase domain, and a C-terminal part that is homologous to the large subunit of ICM (IcmA). The P-loop GTPase domain has very high sequence similarity to the Methylobacterium extorquens MeaB, which is a chaperone for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. We have demonstrated that IcmF is an active ICM by cloning, expressing, and purifying the IcmFs from Geobacillus kaustophilus, Nocardia farcinica, and Burkholderia xenovorans. This finding expands the known distribution of ICM activity well beyond the genus Streptomyces, where it is involved in polyketides biosynthesis, and suggests a role for this enzyme in novel bacterial pathways for amino acid degradation, myxalamid biosynthesis, and acetyl-CoA assimilation."
https://openalex.org/W2004658715,"In fetal hematopoietic organs, the switch from hematopoiesis is hypothesized to be a critical time point for organogenesis, but it is not yet evidenced. The transient coexistence of hematopoiesis will be useful to understand the development of fetal liver (FL) around this time and its relationship to hematopoiesis. Here, the temporal and the comparative transcriptomic and proteomic profiles were observed during the critical time points corresponding to the initiation (E11.5), peak (E14.5), recession (E15.5), and disappearance (3 ddp) of mouse FL hematopoiesis. We found that E11.5-E14.5 corresponds to a FL hematopoietic expansion phase with distinct molecular features, including the expression of new transcription factors, many of which are novel KRAB (Kruppel-associated box)-containing zinc finger proteins. This time period is also characterized by extensive depression of some liver functions, especially catabolism/utilization, immune and defense, classical complement cascades, and intrinsic blood coagulation. Instead, the other liver functions increased, such as xenobiotic and sterol metabolism, synthesis of carbohydrate and glycan, the alternate and lectin complement cascades and extrinsic blood coagulation, and etc. Strikingly, all of the liver functions were significantly increased at E14.5-E15.5 and thereafter, and the depression of the key pathways attributes to build the hematopoietic microenvironment. These findings signal hematopoiesis emigration is the key to open the door of liver maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2161571041,"Background Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous structures which act as prosthetic groups for numerous proteins involved in several fundamental biological processes including respiration and photosynthesis. Although simple in structure both the assembly and insertion of clusters into apoproteins requires complex biochemical pathways involving a diverse set of proteins. In yeast, the J-type chaperone Jac1 plays a key role in the biogenesis of iron sulfur clusters in mitochondria. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we demonstrate that AtHscB from Arabidopsis can rescue the Jac1 yeast knockout mutant suggesting a role for AtHscB in iron sulfur protein biogenesis in plants. In contrast to mitochondrial Jac1, AtHscB localizes to both mitochondria and the cytosol. AtHscB interacts with AtIscU1, an Isu-like scaffold protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and through this interaction AtIscU1 is most probably retained in the cytosol. The chaperone AtHscA can functionally complement the yeast Ssq1knockout mutant and its ATPase activity is enhanced by AtHscB and AtIscU1. Interestingly, AtHscA is also localized in both mitochondria and the cytosol. Furthermore, AtHscB is highly expressed in anthers and trichomes and an AtHscB T-DNA insertion mutant shows reduced seed set, a waxless phenotype and inappropriate trichome development as well as dramatically reduced activities of the iron-sulfur enzymes aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase. Conclusions Our data suggest that AtHscB together with AtHscA and AtIscU1 plays an important role in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins in both mitochondria and the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1975540842,"Dos from Escherichia coli is a bacterial gas sensor protein comprising a heme-containing gas sensor domain and a phosphodiesterase catalytic domain. Using a combination of static light scattering and gel filtration experiments, we established that, as are many other sensor proteins, the full-length protein is dimeric. The full-length dimer (association constant <10 nm) is more stable than the dimeric heme domain (association constant ∼1 μm), and the dimer interface presumably includes both sensor and catalytic domains. Ultrafast spectroscopic studies showed little influence of the catalytic domain on kinetic processes in the direct vicinity of the heme. By contrast, the properties of ligand (CO and O2) binding to the heme in the sensor domain, occurring on a microsecond to second time scale, were found to be influenced by (i) the presence of the catalytic domain, (ii) the dimerization state, and in dimers, (iii) the ligation state of the other subunit. These results imply allosteric interactions within dimers. Steady-state titrations demonstrated marked cooperativity in oxygen binding to both the full-length protein and the isolated heme domain, a feature not reported to date for any dimeric sensor protein. Analysis of a variety of time-resolved experiments showed that Met-95 plays a major role in the intradimer interactions. The intrinsic binding and dissociation rates of Met-95 to the heme were modulated ∼10-fold by intradimer and sensor-catalytic domain interactions.

H., Su, P., Tu, J. M., Wang, X., Liu, H., Plöscher, M., Eichacker, L., Yang, B., Zhou, M., and Scheer, H. (2007) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 104, 14300-14305). We now show that CpcS1 binds PCB and PEB rapidly with bi-exponential kinetics (38/119 and 12/8300 ms, respectively). Chromophore binding to the lyase is reversible and much faster than the spontaneous, but low fidelity chromophore addition to the apo-protein in the absence of the lyase. This indicates kinetic control by the enzyme, which then transfers the chromophore to the apo-protein in a slow (tens of minutes) but stereo- and regioselectively corrects the reaction. This mode of action is reminiscent of chaperones but does not require ATP. The amino acid residues Arg-18 and Arg-149 of the lyase are essential for chromophore attachment in vitro and in Escherichia coli, mutations of His-21, His-22, Trp-75, Trp-140, and Arg-147 result in reduced activity (<30% of wild type in vitro). Mutants R147Q and W69M were active but had reduced capacity for PCB binding; additionally, with W69M there was loss of fidelity in chromophore attachment. Imidazole is a non-competitive inhibitor, supporting a bilin-binding function of histidine. Evidence was obtained that CpcS1 also catalyzes exchange of C-beta84-bound PCB in biliproteins by PEB."

The mitochondrial protein hFis1 is anchored at the outer membrane by a C-terminal transmembrane domain.

Phage ELISA using mutant hFis1 indicates that the peptide binding requires the α2 and α3 helices and the intact TPR structure. Competition experiments and surface plasmon resonance analyses confirmed that a subset of free peptides enriched with proline residues directly bind to the target. Two of these peptides bind to the α1-containing intact cytosolic domain of hFis1 with decreased affinity. Peptide microinjection into cells abolished the mitochondrial swelling induced by overexpression of α1-deleted hFis1, and significantly decreased cytochrome c release from mitochondria upon apoptotic induction.

Blocking mitochondrial fragmentation under these conditions by altering the fission or fusion activities prevents or delays apoptotic progression (39Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S.

This notion indicates that molecular agents such as short peptides or small molecules binding to the fission machinery could inhibit mitochondrial fission and decrease apoptosis-associated pathologies. The fission protein hFis1 is a limiting factor in mitochondrial fission and contains a well-defined binding motif through which protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial fission and apoptosis occur (31Yoon Y.

In this study, we used hFis1 as a target in random peptide phage display screening and identified 10 different peptide sequences binding to the TPR of hFis1. Binding analyses indicated that these peptides bind to a region within the TPR and that the extreme N-terminal region of hFis1 plays a negative role in ligand binding at the TPR. We found that a subset of these sequences binds to the target as synthetic free peptides. Microinjection of hFis1-binding peptides into cells revealed a significant effect on staurosporine-induced apoptosis. This study identifies, for the first time, novel hFis1-binding peptide sequences that will be useful tools for developing therapeutic agents targeting the mitochondrial fission process. The Ph.D.-12TM library from New England Biolabs was used to pan against the target protein His6-Myc hFis1[32–122]. The target protein was purified through the Probond Ni-resin (Invitrogen) from the Escherichia coli lysate and dialyzed in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.6). A single well of a 12-well polystyrene dish was coated with the purified protein at a 100 μg/ml concentration overnight. After the protein-coated well was blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), library phages (4.0 × 1010) were added to the well for target binding. Nonbinding phages were discarded, and the well was washed 10 times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The bound phages were eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2 for 10 min. The eluted solution was immediately neutralized using 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.1 and the eluted phages were amplified by infecting the E. coli strain ER 2738. The amplified phages were precipitated, purified, and titered for the next round of panning. A phage number of 1–2 × 1011 pfu was used for the second and third round of panning using the same method described above. During the third round, the stringency of the wash was increased by using 0.5% Tween 20 in the wash buffer. At the end of the third round of panning, plate binders were eliminated by binding to a BSA-coated plate. The resulting phages were plated without amplification. Twenty phage plaques were isolated and amplified individually, and the phage DNA was purified for DNA sequencing to identify peptide sequences. 96-well plates were coated with the target protein and blocked with BSA. An additional set of uncoated wells was also blocked for the negative control. The amplified phages were added to each well. In experiments with different phage concentrations, serial dilutions of 5- and 10-fold were used. In competition ELISA, appropriate concentrations of synthetic free peptide were added along with phages. After the phage binding and washing, plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (GE Bioscience). Phage binding was measured at 415 nm after a color reaction with an HRP substrate. Direct target binding of free synthetic peptides was assessed using a dual channel SPR instrument (Reichert, Depew, NY). Target proteins were immobilized to the sensor chip surface by free amine coupling with a mixture of 0.1 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide injection followed by quenching the remaining activated carboxyl groups with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A second reference cell was treated similarly, but the target protein was excluded. All working peptide dilutions were prepared in running buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% C12E10) and injected for 4 min (association time) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min followed by a dissociation phase of 10 min. Nonspecific background binding was subtracted from each sensogram using SPR_V4017 Data Acquisition and Alignment Program (Reichert, Depew, NY). Binding rates and constants were independent of flow rate over a wide range. Best-fit kinetic parameters were obtained by global fitting analysis using Scrubber2 (Biologic Software, Australia). Dithiobis[succinimidyl]propionate (DSP) was used for the in vitro cross-linking. Purified His6-Myc hFis1[32–122] (100 μg/ml) was incubated with 50 μm peptides. Cross-linking was carried out for 15 min with 0, 0.1, and 0.2 mm DSP concentrations at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The samples were prepared using SDS-PAGE sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. The cross-linked protein-peptide complex was detected by immunoblotting using anti-Myc antibody (Sigma). Clone 9 (ATCC CRL-1439) cells were used for all experiments. Cells were cultured in Ham's F-12K medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Clone 9 cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the mitochondrial matrix (31Yoon Y. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5409-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) were maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. For microinjection, peptides and DNA were diluted in reverse phosphate-buffered saline (4 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm KCl, pH 7.3) and injected in 100 μm to 1 mm for peptide and 0.05 mg/ml for DNA. When necessary, Texas red-conjugated dextran (3,000 M.W., Molecular Probes) was added at 1–2 mg/ml as the microinjection marker. Cells were plated on the number-etched grid coverslips in 35-mm dishes and were pressure-injected using the Narishige microinjection system. For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then incubated in blocking buffer containing 5% horse serum. Mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen) or anti-Myc (Sigma) was used for primary antibodies. For secondary antibodies, Alexa 488- or Alexa-594-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes Inc.) were used. Fluorescence images were acquired with an Olympus IX71 epifluorescence microscope through a CCD camera (Mediacybernetics, Inc.) driven by IPLab imaging software (Scanalytics, Inc.). Acquired images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.) software. To identify peptide sequences that bind to the mitochondrial fission protein hFis1, we employed random peptide phage display screening. A library of ∼2 × 109 diverse linear 12-mer sequences displayed on M13 phages was screened. The entire cytosolic domain of hFis1 (hFis1[1–122]) was initially used as the binding target for the screening. The target has the N-terminal His6 and Myc tags and was overexpressed and purified from E. coli. However, our repeated attempts to identify peptides binding to the hFis1[1–122] resulted in selecting nonspecifically binding phages. Because previous studies suggest that the N-terminal sequence containing the hFis1 α1-helix interferes with protein binding at the downstream site (36Yu T. Fox R.J. Burwell L.S. Yoon Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4141-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 37Serasinghe M.N. Yoon Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 3494-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we next used the α1-deleted hFis1 (hFis1[32–122]) as a binding target (Fig. 1A). This contains the α2–α6 helices including the intact TPR region, and also the N-terminal His6/Myc tags. Using this target, we were able to identify 10 different hFis1-binding peptide sequences. These peptide sequences were placed in three groups based on sequence characteristics (Fig. 1B). The most abundant and notable sequences (Group 1) include a potential consensus proline-leucine-proline (PLP). Peptides in this group contain 1 or 2 additional proline residues outside the PLP, suggesting that hFis1 may bind to proline-rich sequences. The group 2 contains a leucine-rich sequence toward the C terminus. The two peptides in the group 3 have some similarity in PFWDDL and PHWLDH. To test specific binding of these peptides to the target molecule, we performed phage ELISA experiments. Amplified individual phages (2 × 108) were incubated with or without the target, and phage binding was assessed using anti-M13 antibodies. Because BSA was used to block the target-coated plate during bio-panning, the target binding was compared with binding to a BSA-blocked plate. As shown in Fig. 1C, all 10 phages showed increased absorbance values in the presence of the target protein, indicating phage binding. Uncoated plates showed minimal phage binding similar to BSA-blocked plates (results not shown), indicating that these phages do not bind to the plastic surface. We further performed phage ELISA analyses to evaluate binding strength of phage-borne peptides using one from each group: phage 13, 8, and 9 from group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Increasing numbers of phage were added to the target-containing plates to examine binding efficiency. The ELISA data indicate that these three phage peptides bind to the target with different strengths (Fig. 1D). Phage 13 appeared to be a stronger binder compared with the other two phages. Binding efficiency of Phage 13 (EC50 = 1.0 × 106) was ∼5 and 20 times higher than those of phage 9 (EC50 = 5.3 × 106) and phage 8 (EC50 = 2.1 × 107), respectively. Whereas these three phages do not represent their groups in terms of the binding characteristics of peptides, these data suggest that the phage display screening resulted in identification of peptide sequences with varied binding strengths. To determine peptide binding regions in the hFis1 molecule, three different binding targets, hFis1[1–122], hFis1[32–122], and hFis1[61–122] were used for phage ELISA (Fig. 2A). hFis1[1–122], hFis1[32–122], and hFis1[61–122] contain [α1–α6], [α2–α6], and [α4–α6], respectively. Phage ELISA experiments demonstrated that all 10 phage-peptides bind to the original target [32–122] (α2–α6), whereas there is little binding to [1–122] (α1–α6) and [61–122] (α4–α6) (Fig. 2A). Although binding strengths of different phages varied at the given phage concentration, it is clear that these phages specifically bind to [α2–α6] and not to the others. These results indicate that binding of these peptide sequences requires the α2 and α3 helices and that all four TPR helices may be necessary for binding. The lack of phage binding to [1–122] that contains α1, despite the presence of the TPR region, further supports the notion that the α1-helix has an inhibitory role in the ligand binding at the TPR. Of note, phage binding to the [α2–α6] and not to the other targets that also contain the N-terminal His6 and Myc tags indicate that peptides that we identified bind specifically to the hFis1 molecule and not to the epitope tags. In addition to truncated hFis1, we also used binding targets in which each of the TPR helices contains a helix-breaking point mutation (leucine-to-proline) (36Yu T. Fox R.J. Burwell L.S. Yoon Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4141-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) for the phage ELISA experiments (Fig. 2B). We found that phage binding to these mutant hFis1 proteins was greatly reduced, almost to the control level (Fig. 2B), indicating that peptide binding requires the intact TPR structure. Interestingly, phage 9 showed reduced binding to the α2 and α4 mutants but normal or even increased binding to the α3 and α5 mutants. Phage 7 also had an almost normal binding to the α5 mutant whereas binding to the other mutants was greatly reduced, suggesting that these two peptides have binding characteristics distinct from the others. The phage ELISA results using various truncations and point mutants of hFis1 indicate that the peptide sequences that we identified bind to hFis1 downstream of the α1-helix and require the intact TPR structure for binding. Our data indicate that the peptide sequences that we have identified likely bind to the TPR region of hFis1 as phage-borne peptides. To test whether the free peptides can bind to the hFis1 TPR, three synthetic 12-amino acid peptides corresponding to phages 2, 3, and 10 (Pep2, Pep3, and Pep10, respectively) from each group were made (Fig. 1B). We chose these peptides based on their relatively higher hydrophilicity for better solubility in aqueous solution. To assess the free peptide binding to the target hFis1[32–122], we included them in phage ELISA in a competition assay. In this assay, reduced phage binding indicates the binding of the free peptide to the target at a shared binding site. For the initial assessment of competition, 5, 10, and 50 μm concentrations of peptides were used against their own phages. We observed competition for target binding between the phage 2 and Pep2 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). However, no significant competition was found with Pep3, and only an insignificant overall decrease was observed with Pep10 (Fig. 3A). To obtain more information about shared binding sites of the peptide sequences that we identified, we included each peptide in phage ELISA with different phages in competition assays. As expected based on initial competition results (Fig. 3A), Pep3 and Pep10 showed very little or no competition with all phages including their own phages (supplemental Fig. S1) (see “Discussion”). Unlike these two peptides, the Pep2 containing the putative “PLP” consensus competes with most of the phages for the target binding (Fig. 3B). Although the extent of binding inhibition varied among different phages, Pep2 markedly decreased phage binding except for the binding of phage 9. It is interesting that the binding of phage 9 was unaffected in the presence of the Pep2. As shown with the helix-breaking mutant hFis1 tar"

The organism produces a distinctive polysaccharide capsule that is necessary for its virulence, a predominantly polysaccharide cell wall, and a variety of protein- and lipid-linked glycans. The glycan synthetic pathways of this pathogen are of great interest. Here we report the detection of a novel glycosylphosphotransferase activity in C. neoformans, identification of the corresponding gene, and characterization of the encoded protein. The observed activity is specific for UDP-xylose as a donor and for mannose acceptors and forms a xylose-α-1-phosphate-6-mannose linkage. This is the first report of a xylosylphosphotransferase activity in any system."

https://openalex.org/W1967130426,"As research into alternative splicing reveals the fundamental importance of this phenomenon in the genome expression of higher organisms, there is an increasing need for a standardized, consistent and unique identifier for alternatively spliced isoforms. Such an identifier would be useful to eliminate ambiguities in references to gene isoforms, and would allow for the reliable comparison of isoforms from different sources (e.g., known genes vs. computational predictions). Commonly used identifiers for gene transcripts prove to be unsuitable for this purpose.We propose an algorithm to compute an isoform signature based on the arrangement of exons and introns in a primary transcript. The isoform signature uniquely identifies a transcript structure, and can therefore be used as a key in databases of alternatively spliced isoforms, or to compare alternative splicing predictions produced by different methods. In this paper we present the algorithm to generate isoform signatures, we provide some examples of its application, and we describe a web-based resource to generate isoform signatures and use them in database searches.Isoform signatures are simple, so that they can be easily generated and included in publications and databases, but flexible enough to unambiguously represent all possible isoform structures, including information about coding sequence position and variable transcription start and end sites. We believe that the adoption of isoform signatures can help establish a consistent, unambiguous nomenclature for alternative splicing isoforms.
