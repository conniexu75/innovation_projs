https://openalex.org/W1991254391,"The theory of island biogeography asserts that an island or a local community approaches an equilibrium species richness as a result of the interplay between the immigration of species from the much larger metacommunity source area and local extinction of species on the island (local community). Hubbell generalized this neutral theory to explore the expected steady-state distribution of relative species abundance (RSA) in the local community under restricted immigration. Here we present a theoretical framework for the unified neutral theory of biodiversity and an analytical solution for the distribution of the RSA both in the metacommunity (Fisher's log series) and in the local community, where there are fewer rare species. Rare species are more extinction-prone, and once they go locally extinct, they take longer to re-immigrate than do common species. Contrary to recent assertions, we show that the analytical solution provides a better fit, with fewer free parameters, to the RSA distribution of tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, than the lognormal distribution."

There is some speculation that dietary flavonoids from chocolate, in particular (−)epicatechin, may promote cardiovascular health as a result of direct antioxidant effects or through antithrombotic mechanisms1,2,3. Here we show that consumption of plain, dark chocolate (Fig. 1) results in an increase in both the total antioxidant capacity and the (−)epicatechin content of blood plasma, but that these effects are markedly reduced when the chocolate is consumed with milk or if milk is incorporated as milk chocolate. Our findings indicate that milk may interfere with the absorption of antioxidants from chocolate in vivo and may therefore negate the potential health benefits that can be derived from eating moderate amounts of dark chocolate."

https://openalex.org/W2055012568,"Special relativity asserts that physical phenomena appear the same to all unaccelerated observers. This is called Lorentz symmetry and relates long wavelengths to short ones: if the symmetry is exact it implies that space-time must look the same at all length scales. Several approaches to quantum gravity, however, suggest that there may be a microscopic structure of space-time that leads to a violation of Lorentz symmetry. This might arise because of the discreteness or non-commutivity of space-time, or through the action of extra dimensions. Here we determine a very strong constraint on a type of Lorentz violation that produces a maximum electron speed less than the speed of light. We use the observation of 100-MeV synchrotron radiation from the Crab nebula to improve the previous limit by a factor of 40 million, ruling out this type of Lorentz violation, and thereby providing an important constraint on theories of quantum gravity."

Aβ mainly consisting of 40- and 42-mer peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) exhibits neurotoxicity and aggregative abilities. All of the variants of Aβ40 and Aβ42 found in CAA were synthesized in a highly pure form and examined for neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and aggregative ability. All of the Aβ40 mutants at positions 22 and 23 showed stronger neurotoxicity than wild-type Aβ40. Similar tendency was observed for Aβ42 mutants at positions 22 and 23 whose neurotoxicity was 50-200 times stronger than that of the corresponding Aβ40 mutants, suggesting that these Aβ42 mutants are mainly involved in the pathogenesis of CAA. Although the aggregation of E22G-Aβ42 and D23N-Aβ42 was similar to that of wild-type Aβ42, E22Q-Aβ42 and E22K-Aβ42 aggregated extensively, supporting the clinical evidence that Dutch and Italian patients are diagnosed as hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis. In contrast, A21G mutation needs alternative explanation with the exception of physicochemical properties of Aβ mutants. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra suggested that β-sheet content of the Aβ mutants correlates with their aggregation. However, β-turn is also a critical secondary structure because residues at positions 22 and 23 that preferably form two-residue β-turn significantly enhanced the aggregative ability.

Alzheimer's disease (AD)1 is neuropathologically characterized by the progressive deposition of amyloid in the brain parenchyma and cortical blood vessels (1Selkoe D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). This deposition mainly consists of 40- and 42-mer β-amyloid peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) generated from amyloid precursor protein by two proteases, β- and γ-secretases (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N.

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in familial Alzheimer's disease is linked to missense mutations inside the Aβ-coding region in the amyloid precursor protein. The mutations of Aβ sequence are concentrated at positions 21-23 and are called Flemish (A21G) (4Hendriks L. van Duijn C.M. Cras P. Cruts M. van Hul W. van Harskamp F. Warren A. McInnis M.G.

These Aβ mutant peptides may play a pathological role in the CAAs because wild-type Aβ peptides induce neuronal death in vitro (10Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurotoxicity and formation of amyloid fibrils of some CAA-related Aβ40 mutants have been independently reported by several groups (11Davis J. van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, there are no reports on the neurotoxicity and aggregation of the CAA-related Aβ42 mutants with the exception of Dutch mutation (E22Q) (11Davis J. van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the investigation of which is essential to reveal the mechanism of CAA because wild-type Aβ42 shows considerably stronger neurotoxicity and aggregative ability than wild-type Aβ40 (11Davis J. van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is indispensable to simultaneously compare neurotoxicity and aggregative ability of all of the CAA-related Aβ40 and Aβ42 mutants in the same conditions such as pH, peptide concentration, reaction buffer, and temperature. It is difficult to synthesize Aβ42 with 14 hydrophobic and/or bulky amino acid residues at the C terminus in a highly pure form, because it easily aggregates even under weakly acidic and neutral conditions (16Burdick D.

We recently established a highly efficient method for synthesizing long peptides over 50 amino acid residues with a continuous flow-type peptide synthesizer (Pioneer™) using N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (HATU) (17Carpino L.A.

Res. 2002; 70: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This enabled us to obtain the CAA-related Aβ42 mutants with high purity in combination with the purification under the alkaline condition (23Murakami K. Irie K. Morimoto A. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our continuous research on the CAA-related Aβ peptides led to the synthesis of all of the CAA-related Aβ40 and Aβ42 mutants at positions 21-23 (Fig. 1). Because Lys-Asp (Italian), Gln-Asp (Dutch), Gly-Asp (Arctic), and Glu-Asn (Iowa) sequences at positions 22 and 23 of CAA-related Aβ mutants are frequently found in a two-residue β-turn (24Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 135-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), we synthesized several Aβ40 and Aβ42 derivatives at position 22 substituted by the amino acid residues, which influence the formation of the two-residue β-turn as follows: 1) proline and serine residues in the first position as β-turn inducers and 2) valine and leucine residues as β-turn breakers (24Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 135-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). This paper describes a comprehensive study that shows the neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, aggregative ability, and secondary structure of a series of Aβ derivatives at positions 21-23 including all of the CAA-related mutants and discusses the contribution of the CAA-related mutation to the implication of the pathogenesis of CAA and AD and to the secondary structure at positions 22 and 23 of Aβ peptides. General—The following spectroscopic and analytical instruments were used: peptide synthesizer, Pioneer™ peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); HPLC, Waters 600E multisolvent delivery system with 2487 UV dual λ absorbance detector; Waters 625 LC system with 486 UV tunable absorbance detector and 741 data module; matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE PRO (Applied Biosystems); thioflavin-T (Th-T) fluorescence, SPECTRA max GEMINI XS-TR (Molecular Devices, Ashiya, Japan); micro-plate reader, MPR-A4iII (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan); attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Jasco 480plus; and electron microscope, JEOL JEM-2000EX. MALDI-TOF-MS was measured as reported previously (18Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Fukuda H. Irie K. Nakahara A. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 7: 1213-1221Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HPLC was carried out on a Develosil-packed column ODS-UG-5 (20-mm inside diameter × 150 mm and 6.0-mm inside diameter × 100 mm) (Nomura Chemicals, Seto, Japan). HATU, piperidine, Fmoc amino acids, Fmoc-Val-PEG-PS resin, Fmoc-Ala-PEG-PS resin, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), trifluoroacetic acid, 1,2-ethanedithiol, thioanisole, m-cresol, diethyl ether (peroxide-free), and CH2Cl2 were purchased from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagents were purchased from Sigma. Synthesis of Aβ Derivatives—Each Aβ derivative (Fig. 1) was synthesized in a stepwise fashion on 0.1 mmol of preloaded Fmoc-Val-PEG-PS (for Aβ40 derivatives) or Fmoc-Ala-PEG-PS (for Aβ42 derivatives) resin by Pioneer using the Fmoc method as reported previously (18Irie K. Oie K. Nakahara A. Yanai Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9159-9167Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Fukuda H. Shimizu T. Nakajima M.

Res. 2002; 70: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The coupling reaction was carried out using Fmoc amino acid (0.4 mmol), HATU (0.4 mmol), and DIPEA (0.8 mmol) in DMF for 30 min. After each coupling reaction, the N terminus Fmoc group was deblocked with 20% piperidine in DMF. After completion of the chain elongation, each peptide-resin washed with DMF and CH2Cl2 was treated with a mixture containing trifluoroacetic acid, m-cresol, ethanedithiol, and thioanisole for final deprotection and cleavage from the resin. After 2 h of shaking at room temperature, the crude peptide precipitated by diethyl ether was purified by HPLC under alkaline conditions as reported previously (19Fukuda H. Shimizu T. Nakajima M. Mori H. Shirasawa T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Shimizu T. Fukuda H. Murayama S. Izumiyama N. Shirasawa T. J. Neurosci.

Commun. 2002; 294: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Lyophilization gave a corresponding pure Aβ peptide, the purity of which was confirmed by HPLC (>98%). Cell Culture of PC12 Cells—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from Riken Cell Bank and were cultured as reported previously (23Murakami K. Irie K. Morimoto A. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For experimental purposes, near-confluent cultures of the cells were plated at ∼104 cells/100 μl/well fresh culture medium in 96-well tissue culture plate coated with collagen and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 overnight before experiments. MTT Assay Using PC12 Cells—Reduction of MTT by mitochondrial reductase was carried out by the protocols based on a previous report (25Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Each solution of Aβ derivatives (0.1% NH4OH) sterilized by the filter (0.22 μm) was diluted with 0.1% NH4OH at concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 120 μm. 10 μl of the resultant solution and 10 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl were, respectively, added to the above-mentioned 100-μl cell culture, which was incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 48 h. After removal of 30 μl from the medium, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT in the phosphate buffer solution described above was added to the cell culture, which was incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 4 h. After evacuation of the culture medium, the cell lysis buffer (100 μl/well, 10% SDS, 0.01 m NH4Cl) was subsequently added to the cells and the cell lysate was incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. The colorimetric determination of MTT was made at 600 nm. The absorbance obtained by the addition of vehicle was taken as 100%. Sedimentation Assay for Fibril Formation—Each Aβ derivative was dissolved in 0.02% NH4OH at 250 μm. After a 10-fold dilution by 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4, the resultant peptide solution (25 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 16, 24, or 48 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, 25 μl of the supernatant was then analyzed by HPLC as reported previously (23Murakami K. Irie K. Morimoto A. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The area of the absorption at 220 nm was integrated and expressed as a percentage of the control. Th-T Fluorescence Assay—Each Aβ derivative was dissolved in 0.02% NH4OH at 250 μm. The peptide solution (25 μm) diluted with the phosphate buffer solution described above was incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 16, 24, or 48 h. Ten microliters of each Aβ solution was added to 1 ml of 5 μm Th-T in 50 mm Gly-NaOH, pH 8.5. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 450-nm excitation and 482-nm emission as reported previously (26Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Transmission Electron Micrographs of Negatively Stained Preparations of Aβ42 Fibrils—The fibril formation of the Aβ42 derivatives was detected by electron microscope. Each Aβ42 derivative (25 μm) was incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl for 48 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed from pellets. Aggregates were then suspended in water by gentle vortex mixing. These suspensions were applied to a 400-mesh collodion-coated copper grid (Nissin EM, Tokyo, Japan) and allowed to dry in air before being negatively stained for 2 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Fibrils were examined with the JEOL JEM-2000EX electron microscope. ATR-FTIR Measurements to Estimate the Secondary Structure of Aβ42 Derivatives—Each Aβ42 derivative was dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl at 250 μm. The Aβ42 solution was lyophilized or incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The 48-h incubated sample was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended in distilled water, centrifuged, and lyophilized to give a white powder, which was loaded on an ATR cell in the FTIR spectrometer (Jasco 480plus). At the same time, each Aβ42 derivative without incubation was also subjected to the ATR-FTIR measurement. 50 scans were accumulated to improve the signal/noise ratio, and the spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4.0 cm-1. The program IR-SSE (Jasco) was used to estimate the secondary structure of each derivative by principal component regression. Synthesis of Aβ Derivatives—The CAA-related Aβ40 and Aβ42 mutants at positions 21-23 were synthesized to examine their relation to the pathogenesis of these CAAs (Fig. 1). Several Aβ derivatives in which the Glu-22 residue of wild-type Aβ was substituted by amino acid residues (proline, serine, valine, and leucine) that effectively influence the formation of the two-residue β-turn (24Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 135-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar) were also prepared to investigate the secondary structure of Aβ derivatives at positions 21-23 (Fig. 1). These peptides were synthesized with continuous flow-type peptide synthesizer (Pioneer) using HATU as an effective activator for Fmoc chemistry. After final deprotection and cleavage from the resin followed by purification using HPLC in the alkaline condition (CH3CN, 0.1% NH4OH), each Aβ derivative was successfully taken in a highly pure form as reported previously (19Fukuda H. Shimizu T. Nakajima M. Mori H. Shirasawa T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Shimizu T. Fukuda H. Murayama S. Izumiyama N. Shirasawa T. J.

Total yields of these derivatives were consequently between 2 and 24%, indicating that average coupling yield of each condensation step was 95-97%. Their molecular weights were confirmed by MALDI-TOF-MS (Table I), and their purity was determined by HPLC analysis (>98%).Table IYields and MALDI-TOF-MS data of Aβ derivatives synthesized in this studyAβ derivativesYieldObserved massCalculated mass (MH+)%Aβ4014.44331.624330.96A21G-Aβ4026.24316.944316.84E22Q-Aβ409.84329.314329.88E22K-Aβ409.64329.334329.92E22G-Aβ408.04258.234258.80D23N-Aβ4010.94329.124329.88E22P-Aβ4015.94299.314298.96Aβ423.24514.434515.20A21G-Aβ4222.74501.234501.08E22Q-Aβ426.34514.394514.12E22K-Aβ422.34514.424514.16E22G-Aβ422.14443.354443.04D23N-Aβ421.94513.944514.12E22P-Aβ424.04483.614483.20E22S-Aβ424.94473.564473.07E22V-Aβ426.44485.494485.12E22L-Aβ426.14499.894499.15 Open table in a new tab Neurotoxicity Studies Using PC12 Cells—Neurotoxicity of the Aβ derivatives was estimated by the MTT assay (25Shearman M.S.

Effect of the Aβ derivatives on the mitochondrial reductase, which converts MTT to colored formazan, was examined by exposing the cells to the peptides and measuring the cellular proliferation and viability at various time points. We used rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, which are particularly sensitive to Aβ peptides (25Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The IC50 value for inhibition of formazan formation by each Aβ peptide was calculated using the probit procedure (27James H.G. Council K.A. Helwig J.T. SAS User's Guide. SAS Institute, Cary, NC1979: 357-360Google Scholar). The concentration of the Aβ derivatives to inhibit the formazan formation ranged from 10-8 to 10-5m as shown in Table II.Table IINeurotoxicity in PC 12 cells of Aβ derivatives estimated by the MTT assayAβ derivativesIC50μ m ± S.D.Aβ40 (Wild-type)>100A21G-Aβ40 (Flemish)>100E22Q-Aβ40 (Dutch)3.4 ± 0.91E22K-Aβ40 (Italian)11 ± 2.2E22G-Aβ40 (Arctic)11 ± 2.2D23N-Aβ40 (Iowa)78E22P-Aβ408.0 ± 0.72Aβ42 (Wild-type)0.97 ± 0.18A21G-Aβ42 (Flemish)1.7 ± 0.30E22Q-Aβ42 (Dutch)0.068 ± 0.011E22K-Aβ42 (Italian)0.14 ± 0.030E22G-Aβ42 (Arctic)0.14 ± 0.050D23N-Aβ42 (Iowa)0.38 ± 0.16E22P-Aβ420.084 ± 0.011E22V-Aβ42>100 Open table in a new tab Wild-type Aβ40 did not inhibit the formazan formation even at 10-5m, whereas wild-type Aβ42 considerably inhibited it at 10-6m. All of the CAA-related Aβ40 mutants at position 22 inhibited significantly the formazan formation at 10-5m. On the other hand, A21G-Aβ40 (Flemish) did not show any neurotoxic effect even at 10-5m. The CAA-related Aβ42 mutants at position 22 (Dutch, Italian, and Arctic) also showed approximately 10-fold the neurotoxicity of wild-type Aβ42. A concentration of 50% inhibition of the formazan formation was approximately 10-7m. D23N-Aβ42 (Iowa) mutant at position 23 showed 2-3-fold more potent cytotoxicity than wild-type Aβ42. A21G-Aβ42 (Flemish) showed a slightly weaker yet still significant neurotoxic effect on the PC12 cells compared with wild-type Aβ42 (Table II). Aggregation Studies—The aggregative ability of Aβ can be estimated by sedimentation assay using HPLC after centrifugation of the Aβ peptide solution. Aβ aggregates are also detectable using Th-T, which binds specifically to the aggregates to show intense fluorescence (28Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). One drawback of the Th-T assay is that it is not always quantitative because Th-T fluorescence can vary depending on the structure and morphology of the fibrils. The sedimentation assay is more suitable for quantification of the aggregates. Almost of all soluble wild-type Aβ40 was detected even after 24-h incubation by the sedimentation assay (Fig. 2A), indicating that wild-type Aβ40 hardly aggregated by 24-h incubation. This result is in good agreement with that of the Th-T assay (Fig. 2B). The fluorescent intensity of Aβ40 was almost equal to that of the control. On the other hand, soluble wild-type Aβ42 could not be detected after 24-h incubation by the sedimentation assay (Fig. 3A), indicating that wild-type Aβ42 aggregated completely after 24-h incubation. This result correlated very well with that of the Th-T assay where the fluorescent intensity already reached plateau after 16-h incubation (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that the aggregative ability of Aβ42 is far more potent than that of Aβ40, and their aggregative ability correlates very well with their neurotoxicity.Fig. 3A, comparative study of the aggregation of CAA-related Aβ42 mutants at positions 21-23 estimated by sedimentation assay. •, wild-type Aβ42; *, A21G-Aβ42 (Flemish); ○, E22G-Aβ42 (Arctic); ♦, E22Q-Aβ42 (Dutch); □, E22K-Aβ42 (Italian); ▵, and D23N-Aβ42 (Iowa).

Reflecting the significant difference in the aggregative ability between Aβ40 and Aβ42, the aggregative ability of all of the Aβ40 mutants at position 22 failed to exceed that of wild-type Aβ42. E22G-Aβ40 showed a potent Th-T fluorescence while the Th-T intensity of E22Q- and E22K-Aβ40 did not reflect their high aggregative rate in the sedimentation assay (Fig. 2B). The aggregative potency of A21G-Aβ40 (Flemish) was lowest among the Aβ40 mutants (Fig. 2A), and the Th-T fluorescence of this peptide was also weaker than that of wild-type Aβ40 (Fig. 2B). The aggregative ability of all of the Aβ40 mutants estimated by the sedimentation assay correlated generally with their neurotoxicity (Table II). Aggregative ability of the CAA-related Aβ42 mutants is shown in Fig. 3. E22Q-Aβ42 (Dutch) and E22K-Aβ42 (Italian) aggregated faster than wild-type Aβ42 in the sedimentation assay (Fig. 3A). Although the aggregative potency of E22G-Aβ42 (Arctic) and D23N-Aβ42 (Iowa) was slightly lower than that of wild-type Aβ42, the aggregative rate of E22G-Aβ42 after 4-h incubation was almost similar to that of wild-type Aβ42 and the aggregated amount of D23N-Aβ42 after 24-h incubation was nearly comparable with that of wild-type Aβ42 (Fig. 3A). Th-T fluorescence intensity of all of the Aβ42 mutants at positions 22 and 23 after 4-h incubation was almost similar, and these results did not reflect exactly those of the sedimentation assay (Fig. 3B). The aggregative ability of Aβ42 mutants at positions 22 and 23 examined by sedimentation assay correlated generally with their neurotoxicity (Table II). However, A21G-Aβ42 (Flemish) with a substantial neurotoxicity (Table II) aggregated hardly after 24-h incubation (Fig. 3A) and showed no Th-T fluorescence after 4-h incubation (Fig. 3B). Only this peptide did not follow the general pattern that the aggregative ability of the peptide correlates with its neurotoxicity. Transmission Electron Micrographs of Negatively Stained Preparations of Aβ42 Fibrils—Fibril formation of the Aβ42 mutants was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy after a 48-h incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4). Typical fibrils were formed in all of the CAA-related Aβ42 mutants with the exception of A21G-Aβ42 (Flemish), which did not aggregate at all as described above. The morphology of these fibrils resembled each other well. However, the length of the D23N-Aβ42 (Iowa) fibril was slightly shorter than that of the others. ATR-FTIR Measurements of the Aβ42 Derivatives—Aβ aggregates are generally considered to contain a significant amount of the β-sheet structure (29Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To estimate the secondary structure of the Aβ mutants, ATR-FTIR measurement was carried out on the CAA-related Aβ42 peptides. Each Aβ42 mutant lyophilized immediately after dissolving in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl or after a 48-h incubation in the same sodium phosphate buffer at 37 °C was subjected to the ATR-FTIR analysis (Fig. 5).

VHL-/- RCC cells overproduce hypoxia-inducible genes as a consequence of constitutive, oxygen-independent activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). While HIF activation explains the highly vascularized nature of VHL loss lesions, the relative role of HIF in oncogenesis and loss of growth control remains unknown. Here, we report that HIF plays a central role in promoting unregulated growth of VHL-/- RCC cells by activating the transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α)/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) pathway. Dominant-negative HIF and enzymatic inhibition of EGF-R were equally efficient at abolishing EGF-R activation and serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells. TGF-α is the only known EGF-R ligand that has a VHL-dependent expression profile and its overexpression by VHL-/- RCC cells is a direct consequence of HIF activation. In contrast to TGF-α, other HIF targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were unable to stimulate serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells. VHL-/- RCC cells expressing reintroduced type 2C mutants of VHL, and which retain the ability to degrade HIF, fail to overproduce TGF-α and proliferate in serum-free media. These data link HIF with the overproduction of a bona fide renal cell mitogen leading to activation of a pathway involved in growth of renal cancer cells. Moreover, our results suggest that HIF might be involved in oncogenesis to a much higher extent than previously appreciated.

Although VHL follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (3Maher E.R. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Medicine (Baltimore). 1997; 76: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), tumor formation arises only when the remaining wild-type allele acquires a somatic inactivating mutation as predicted by Knudson's two-hit hypothesis (4Knudson Jr., A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5483) Google Scholar). Bi-allelic-inactivating mutations of the VHL gene are also found in the majority of sporadic clear cell renal cell carcinomas, the most common malignancy of the human kidney (VHL-/- RCC) (5Zbar B.

Reintroduction of the VHL gene into VHL-/- RCC cells (hereafter referred to as “VHL(+)” cells) abolishes their ability to form tumors in nude mice, suggesting that loss of VHL function is a prerequisite for tumor formation (7Iliopoulos O. Kibel A. Gray S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VHL-/- RCC cells display several key features of transformed cells, including the inability to form an extracellular fibronectin matrix (8Ohh M. Park C.W. Ivan M. Hoffman M.A. Kim T.Y. Huang L.E. Pavletich N. Chau V. Kaelin W.G. Nat.

These features can be corrected by the reintroduction of VHL.VHL forms a complex with several proteins including elongin B, elongin C, cullin-2, and Rbx1 to form a multiprotein complex referred to as VBC/Cul-2 (11Kaelin W.G.

The HIF transcription factor assembles as a heterodimer containing one of three different α-subunits and a β-subunit, and together, regulates the expression of several genes involved in the cellular response to hypoxia (22Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). These genes include the glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), erythropoeitin, and the angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (22Semenza G.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 551-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). While the HIFβ subunit is constitutively expressed (21Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E.

However, the link between VHL loss, HIF activation, and how this relates to loss of growth control remains a key unanswered question.Cancer cells are generally capable of engaging in autonomous growth as reflected by their ability to proliferate in serum-free conditions (35Hanahan D.

We previously reported that VHL-/- RCC cells are also able to proliferate in the absence of exogenous growth factors and that this defect is correctable by the reintroduction of VHL (10de Paulsen N.

Transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) was identified as a potential agent responsible for serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells. Several pieces of evidence point toward an oncogenic role for TGF-α in VHL-/- RCC cells. First, overproduction of TGF-α and its cognate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) has been described in overt sporadic RCC tumors in vivo (39Atlas I. Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Fair W.R. Masui H.

However, the mechanism linking VHL loss-of-function to TGF-α overexpression, including the relative contribution of HIF activation to proliferation of VHL-/- RCC cells, remains unknown. In this report, we show that HIF activation is required for serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells, and this is a consequence of the activation of the EGF-R. We also show that HIF activation is required for overproduction of a TGF-α, an EGF-R ligand and bona fide renal cell mitogen. We thus provide the first direct evidence for a mechanism linking HIF activation with its postulated role in oncogenesis in VHL-/- RCC cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell Culture—The human sporadic RCC cell line 786-0 contains a single mutated VHL allele predicted to encode a truncated VHL protein. The 786-0 (VHL-/-) renal clear cell line (i.e. the RCC cells) and the A498 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The WT-7 (VHL(+)) cell line is derived from 786-0 cells stably transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged VHL, a kind gift from William Kaelin, Harvard University. The Type 2C VHL cell lines (stable transfectants of 786-0 cells with pVHL L188V, pVHL R64P, and pVHL F119S) were a kind gift from Dr. W. Kaelin (47Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) in a 37 °C, humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. Hypoxia treatment was performed in a hypoxic chamber with 1% O2 atmosphere and tempered at 37 °C.Viral Expression Vectors—The wild-type HIF-2α cDNA in pcDNA3.1 was PCR-amplified with primerEPAS-1-DN 5′BamHI(AGCTGGATCCGCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAACAGCTGACAAGGAGAAGAAAAGGAGTAGC) and primer EPAS-1-DN-3′NotI (ACGTGCGGCCGCTCAAGGGCTATTGGGCGTGGAGCAGCTGCTGCTGC) to yield a truncated HIF-2α (amino acids 1–485), restricted with BamHI and NotI, and ligated into pAdlox-GFP (kind gift from Dr. David Park, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) to produce an adenovirus that expresses DNHIF. Other adenoviruses were generated as described elsewhere (29Bonicalzi M.E. Groulx I. de Paulsen N. Lee S. J. Biol.

All constructs were authenticated by DNA sequencing.Construction of Adenovirus through Cre-Lox Recombination—CRE8 and 293 cells were obtained from Dr. David Park and cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. The properties of CRE8 cells are described elsewhere (49Chen L. Anton M. Graham F.L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transfections were done according to Graham and van der Eb (50Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Typically, a confluent 10-cm diameter dish of CRE8 cells (1.6 × 107) was split into 5–6-cm diameter dishes for transfection 2–4 h later. Each dish received 3 μg of pAdlox vector (containing the foreign VHL/HIF construct) and 3 μg of 5 viral DNA in a final volume of 0.5 ml of CaPO4, which was applied to the cells for 16 h. The 10% fetal calf serum DMEM was changed for 2% fetal calf serum DMEM 16 h following the transfection. Cells were fed with fresh 2% DMEM after 64 h. Between day 8 and 10, we had a sizable infection in each dish, almost all of the cells were rounded up or floating. Cells were harvested and subjected to freeze/thaw three times with an alternating liquid N2/37 °C water bath. Finally, a plaque purification assay was performed in order to isolate the recombinant viruses, which were amplified in CRE8 cells to a higher titer.Measurement of TGF-α Expression in Cell Lysates—VHL-/- and VHL-positive RCC cells were plated approaching confluence, in DMEM and 10% FCS. After 48–60 h incubation at normoxic conditions (5% CO2 plus room air) cells were washed, trypsinized, and lysed according to ELISA kit instructions (Oncogene). TGF-α levels were normalized to total cellular protein content (μg) as determined by the BCA method (Pierce).Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Experiments—PD153035 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (51Fry D.W.

Suzuma K. Nishimura K. Honda Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a vascular endothelial factor inhibitor (Calbiochem) were resuspended in Me2SO and added to cells maintained in DMEM or ITS to achieve concentrations of 1–10 μm (PD153035), 50 μm (AG1296), and 80 μm Tranilast. Neutralizing antibody to TGF-α was purchased from Calbiochem and used at a concentration suggested by the manufacturer.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 4% SDS in PBS, and the DNA was sheared with a 20-gauge needle. Protein concentration was quantified with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and 20–50 μg of protein was analyzed on an SDS/8% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Before immunodetection, membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) skim milk powder (Carnation, Glendale, CA) in a 0.2% Tween PBS solution for 1 h. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with a monoclonal anti-HIF-1α (1:500; Novus, Littleton, CO), a polyclonal anti-Glut1 (1:1000; Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), a monoclonal antibody against EGF-R (1:200; Ab-12 LabVision; Fremont, CA), a rabbit polyclonal anti-pYEGFR (Tyr-1173) (sc-12351, Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-actin (1:4000; Sigma) antibody. After washing with 0.2% Tween PBS solution, membranes were incubated for 1 h with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).BrdUrd Labeling—Cells were plated at low density on coverslips and incubated for at least 16 h in DMEM plus 10% FBS. Cells were washed in PBS and incubated under various growth conditions, as indicated for the indicated time. Cells incubated in the presence of 10 μm BrdUrd (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 3 h prior to labeling. Cells were then fixed in 70% ethanol in 50 mm glycine (pH 2.0) for at least 30 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with a solution containing an anti-BrdUrd antibody for 30 min at 37 °C and washed and incubated with an anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated secondary antibody. All coverslips were counterstained with Hoechst reagent to identify nuclei and the percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells (FITC-stained cells/Hoechst-stained cells) was determined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope and digital imaging.RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIPURE isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was performed on 500 ng of RNA using the One-Step Superscript RT Platinum TaqRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) and 0.6 μm of each primer (Table I). Cycling conditions were 30 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 94 °C, 25 or 30 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, 40 s at 72 °C, with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. RT-PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining visualized using a Kodak digital science IC440 system. The sequences of the primers used in this study are as follows: TGF-α forward: 5′-TCGCTCTGGGTATTGTGTTG-3′; TGF-α reverse: 5′-GACCTGGCAGCAGTGTATCA-3′; EGF forward: 5′-CGCAGGAAATGGGAATTCTA-3′; EGF reverse: 5′-CCTTCCTGTTGATTTGACCA-3′; Amphiregulin forward: 5′-TGGATTGGACCTCAATGACA-3′; Amphiregulinreverse: 5′-CCATTTTTGCCTCCCTTTTT-3′; Betacellulin forward: 5′-TGGGAATTCCACCAGAAGTC-3′; Betacellulin reverse: 5′-TTACGACGTTTCCGAAGAGG-3′; Epiregulin forward: 5′-AGGATGGAGATGCTCTGTGC-3′; Epiregulin reverse: 5′-GTGTTCACATCGGACACCAG-3′; HB-EGF forward: 5′-GGTGGTGCTGAAGCTCTTTC-3′; HB-EGF reverse: 5′-CCCATGACACCTCTCTCCAT-3′; Glut-1forward: 5′-CTGTCTGGCATCAACGCTGTCTTC-3′; Glut-1 reverse: TCCTCGGGTGTCTTATCACTTTGG; β-actin forward: 5′-CGTACCACTGGCATCGTGAT-3′; β-actin reverse: 5′-GTGTTGGCGTACAGGTCTTTG-3′.For real time RT-RCR, triplicates of 25-μl multiplex PCR reactions were performed on 50 ng of total RNA using TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR master mix reagents (Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 μm 5′-VIC of TGF-α- and 5′-6FAM β-actin-modified probes. Cycling conditions were 30 min at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°, 1 min at 60 °C. Amplification and analysis were performed using ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and data normalized to the β-actin endogenous control. Primers for the real time RT-PCR experiments were designed as follows: Real time TGF-α forward: 5′-GCACGTCCCCGCTGAGT-3′; Real time TGF-α probe: 5′-TTTTAATGACTGCCCAGATTCCCACACTCA-3′; Real time TGF-α reverse: 5′-CAGGTTCCATGGAAGCAGAA-3′; Real time β-actin forward: 5′-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCCGA-3′; Real time β-actin probe: 5′-CCGCCGCCCGTCCACACCCGCC-3′; Real time β-actin reverse: 5′-CTGGTGCCTGGGGCG-3′.RESULTSHIF Activation Is Required for EGF-R-dependent Growth of VHL -/- RCC Cells in Serum-free Media—Cancer cells are generally capable of engaging in autonomous growth reflected by their ability to proliferate in serum-free medium (35Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21906) Google Scholar, 36Weinberg R.A. Sci.

We recently reported that VHL-/- RCC cells share this defect, which is correctable by the reintroduction of VHL (10de Paulsen N. Brychzy A. Fournier M.C. Klausner R.D. Gnarra J.R. Pause A. Lee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1387-1392PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of HIF activation in the ability of VHL-/- RCC cells to engage in serum-independent growth, we produced an adenovirus that expresses a truncated version of HIF-2α, which acts as a dominant-negative molecule repressing HIF-mediated gene expression (DNHIF) (54Maemura K. Hsieh C.M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as well as an adenovirus that expresses a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion to HIF-1α (48Groulx I. Lee S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5319-5336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We also engineered adenoviruses that express GFP alone and GFP fused to VHL (VHL), and a naturally occurring C-terminal truncation mutant of VHL (Δ157-VHL) that fails to mediate oxygen-dependent degradation of HIFα (Fig. 1A). Infection efficiency was more than 90% in all cell lines used in this study, and production of the recombinant proteins was monitored by Western blots (data not shown and see Refs. 29Bonicalzi M.E. Groulx I. de Paulsen N. Lee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 45Prewett M. Rothman M. Waksal H. Feldman M. Bander N.H. Hicklin D.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2957-2966PubMed Google Scholar). Normoxic VHL-/- RCC cells overproduce Glut-1 as a consequence of HIF activation, which is correctable by the reintroduction of VHL (55Iliopoulos O. Levy A.P. Jiang C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Goldberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10595-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). DNHIF was as efficient as VHL at down-regulating Glut-1 levels in normoxic VHL-/- RCC cells incubated in the presence or absence of serum compared with controls (uninfected cells), or cells expressing Δ157-VHL, or GFP alone (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, overproduction of HIF-1α led to Glut-1 accumulation in normoxic VHL(+) cells, regardless of serum conditions (Fig. 1A). These results demonstrate that DNHIF and HIF-1α can be used as tools to inhibit or activate HIF-targets in normoxic VHL-/- RCC or VHL(+) cells, respectively.We then examined whether the serum-independent growth phenotype observed in VHL-/- RCC cells is a consequence of HIF activation. DNHIF was as efficient as VHL at abolishing serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells, as measured by a marked reduction in the ability of these cells to incorporate BrdUrd (Fig. 1B). In contrast, VHL-/- RCC cells expressing GFP or Δ157-GFP incorporated BrdUrd to levels similar to those of uninfected cells. Addition of 5% serum abolished the growth inhibitory effect of DNHIF and VHL. Likewise, overproduction of HIF-1α was sufficient to enable VHL(+) cells to proliferate in serum-free medium (ITS), in contrast to uninfected VHL(+) cells or cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the ability of VHL-/- RCC cells to engage in serum-independent growth is a consequence of HIF activation.We previously reported that overexpression of TGF-α and activation of EGF-R were involved in serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells (10de Paulsen N. Brychzy A. Fournier M.C. Klausner R.D. Gnarra J.R. Pause A. Lee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1387-1392PubMed Google Scholar). Based on data shown in Fig. 1, we next asked whether HIF activation promoted serum-independent growth of VHL-/- RCC cells through EGF-R-dependent or -independent pathways. To do so, we first compared the effect of DNHIF and reintroducing VHL on EGF-R levels and phosphorylation state in VHL-/- RCC cells. Levels of EGF-R remained essentially unchanged regard"
https://openalex.org/W2068317896,"Hydrodynamic flow in classical and quantum fluids can be either laminar or turbulent. Vorticity in turbulent flow is often modelled with vortex filaments. While this represents an idealization in classical fluids, vortices are topologically stable quantized objects in superfluids. Superfluid turbulence1 is therefore thought to be important for the understanding of turbulence more generally. The fermionic 3He superfluids are attractive systems to study because their characteristics vary widely over the experimentally accessible temperature regime. Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance measurements and numerical simulations indicating the existence of sharp transition to turbulence in the B phase of superfluid 3He. Above 0.60Tc (where Tc is the transition temperature for superfluidity) the hydrodynamics are regular, while below this temperature we see turbulent behaviour. The transition is insensitive to the fluid velocity, in striking contrast to current textbook knowledge of turbulence2. Rather, it is controlled by an intrinsic parameter of the superfluid: the mutual friction between the normal and superfluid components of the flow, which causes damping of the vortex motion."
https://openalex.org/W1992539503,"Post-transcriptional gene silencing by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is rapidly becoming a powerful tool for genetic analysis of mammalian cells. Delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells is usually achieved via the transfection of double-stranded oligonucleotides or plasmids encoding RNA polymerase III promoter-driven small hairpin RNA. Recently, retroviral vectors have been used for siRNA delivery, which overcome the problem of poor transfection efficiency seen with the plasmid-based systems. However, retroviral vectors have several limitations, such as the need for active cell division for gene transduction, oncogenic potential, low titers and gene silencing. In this report, we have adapted a commercially available adenoassociated virus (AAV) vector for siRNA delivery into mammalian cells. We demonstrate the ability of this modified vector to deliver efficiently siRNA into HeLa S3 cells and downregulate p53 and caspase 8 expression. Our results suggest that AAV-based vectors are efficient vectors for the delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells. Based on the known ability of these vectors to infect both dividing and nondividing cells, their use as a therapeutic tool for the delivery of siRNA deserves further study."

It binds cyclin T1 structurally and functionally from the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). The cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) in P-TEFb then phosporylates the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is required for the transition from initiation to elongation of eukaryotic transcription. Inhibiting P-TEFb blocks the transcription of its target genes as well as cellular proliferation and apoptosis induced by c-Myc."

However, the mechanisms regulating the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 induced by hyperosmotic stress are poorly understood. In this study, we observed that hyperosmotic stress induced by mannitol increased the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 in cultured rat astrocytes, and intraperitoneal infusion of mannitol increased AQP4 and AQP9 in the rat brain cortex. In addition, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, but not ERK and JNK inhibitors, suppressed their expression in cultured astrocytes. AQPs play important roles in maintaining brain homeostasis. The expression of AQP4 and AQP9 in astrocytes changes after brain ischemia or traumatic injury, and some studies have shown that p38 MAPK in astrocytes is activated under similar conditions.

Water passes across cell membranes substantially faster than can be explained by simple diffusion. This is necessary for the active regulation of water homeostasis under conditions of osmotic stress in the kidneys, lungs, brain, etc., and to meet these needs, a family of membrane channel proteins evolved.

Many types of cells respond to changes in osmotic pressure with adaptive mechanisms that allow them to re-establish homeostasis of those aspects of cell structure and function that have been disturbed osmotically (20Kultz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Osmotic stress may damage DNA and proteins, resulting in impairment of cell function and the induction of repair processes and protection systems (21Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Immunol.

These relatively nonspecific responses to cell damage may be an important aspect of cellular adaptation to osmotic stress. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), specifically extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, are important intracellular signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to changes in osmolality (22Burg M.B.

Regulation of tissue water content and brain volume is critical for normal functioning of the central nervous system, which is highly sensitive to any increase in intracranial pressure. Brain edema may rapidly become life-threatening because of the rigid encasement of the brain. AQPs were suggested to have a role in maintaining the homeostasis of the brain (27Venero J.L.

Magistretti P.J. Regli L. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) is sensitive to brain injury, swelling, and other experimental interventions. AQP4 in astrocytes of the brain cortex decreased in the acute phase of brain injury (32Ke C. Poon W.S. Ng H.K. Pang J.C. Chan Y. Neurosci.

AQP4-deficient mice survive much longer and have a better neurological outcome from experimentally induced brain edema than wild-type mice (36Manley G.T. Fujimura M. Ma T. Noshita N. Filiz F. Bollen A.W. Chan P. Verkman A.S. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). AQP4 in astrocytes is tightly associated with the blood-brain barrier (37Nico B. Frigeri A. Nicchia G.P. Quondamatteo F. Herken R. Errede M. Ribatti D. Svelto M. Roncali L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1297-1307PubMed Google Scholar). In the brain cortex, astrocyte-specific AQP9 appears in the infarct border zone after transient ischemic stroke (35Badaut J. Hirt L. Granziera C. Bogousslavsky J. Magistretti P.J. Regli L. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Hyperosmotic solutions of mannitol are used commonly to reduce brain edema, so it is important to elucidate the relationship between the expression of AQPs and hyperosmolarity induced with mannitol. This study was designed to assess the effects of hyperosmotic stress induced with mannitol on the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 and to identify the signal transduction pathways regulating the response in rat astrocytes in which AQP4 and AQP9 are localized (10Yamamoto N. Yoneda K. Asai K. Sobue K. Tada T. Fujita Y. Katsuya H. Fujita M. Aihara N. Mase M. Yamada K. Miura Y. Kato T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 is induced in cultured rat astrocytes and in rat brain cortex by hyperosmotic stress. In addition, we demonstrated that this induction requires selective activation and involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway in cultured rat astrocytes. We believe this study provides the first example of osmotic regulation of AQP4 and AQP9 and the first evidence that the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 is regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway. Cell Culture—Cultures of cortical astrocytes were prepared from rat postnatal cortices (P2) according to previously described methods (38Kato T. Chiu T.C. Lim R. Troy S.S. Turriff D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 216-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Trypsinized and dissociated cortical cells were cultured in 75-cm2 culture flasks (Corning Glass) containing low glucose (1000 mg/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (l-DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). After incubation for 5–7 days, the cells were trypsinized and subcultured in 60-mm diameter culture dishes (Falcon; PGC Scientific, Frederick, MD). The cell population consisted of over 95% astrocytes as determined by immunocytochemical staining with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody. In neural cells, AQP4 and AQP9 are expressed in astrocytes but not in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia (10Yamamoto N. Yoneda K. Asai K. Sobue K. Tada T. Fujita Y. Katsuya H. Fujita M. Aihara N. Mase M. Yamada K. Miura Y. Kato T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Hyperosmotic Stress of Cultured Rat Astrocytes—When astrocyte cultures became confluent, equal volumes of medium with or without various concentrations of mannitol (Sigma) were added, and the cultures were incubated for the indicated times. Osmolality of the medium was measured by the freezing point depression method (Osmostat™ OM-6040; ARKREY, Kyoto, Japan). All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—At the indicated times, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were generated from 1 μg of total RNA by Superscript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed with oligo(dT)18 (Invitrogen). They were amplified with primers designed according to the published sequences. The PCR protocols and primers for AQP4, AQP9, and β-actin have been described previously (10Yamamoto N. Yoneda K. Asai K. Sobue K. Tada T. Fujita Y. Katsuya H. Fujita M. Aihara N. Mase M. Yamada K. Miura Y. Kato T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 90: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers were as follows: AQP4 (39Jung J.S. Bhat R.V. Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Baraban J.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ishibashi K. Marumo F. Hayakawa T. Sasaki S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 309-318PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-GATGCCTTCTGAGAAGGACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAGAGCCATCACGACTGC-3′ (reverse); β-actin (41Nudel U. Zakut R. Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), 5′-GACCTGACTGACTACCTCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCT-3′ (reverse). Multitarget PCRs were performed by coamplifying β-actin as the internal standard. The reaction mixture for AQP4 contained 2 μl of the RT reaction product, and the reaction was carried out for 20 cycles, using a 95 °C, 30-s denaturing step; a 57 °C, 30-s annealing step; and a 72 °C, 1-min extension step. The reaction mixture for AQP9 contained 2 μl of the RT reaction product, and the reaction was carried out for 27 cycles, using a 95 °C, 30-s denaturing step; a 58 °C, 30-s annealing step; and a 72 °C, 1-min extension step. Semiquantification of mRNA—The PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining following separation on 1.5% agarose gels and quantified by laser-induced fluorescence-linked capillary gel electrophoresis. Details of laser-induced fluorescence-linked capillary gel electrophoresis have been reported elsewhere (10Yamamoto N. Yoneda K. Asai K. Sobue K. Tada T. Fujita Y. Katsuya H. Fujita M. Aihara N.

Brain Res. 2001; 95: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of PCR products was applied to a P/ACE system 5010 (Beckman Instruments). Samples were injected at a pressure of 0.5 p.s.i.g. for 20 s. Separation was carried out at 9.4 kV for 35 min in a capillary (47 cm long, 100-μm diameter) filled with electrophoresis gel buffer containing DNA fluorescence stain (LIFluor dsDNA 1000 kit; Beckman). Laser-induced fluorescence detection was preformed using an argon-ion laser source with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. The chromatograms were visualized and analyzed automatically using GOLD Software (Beckman). The peaks were expressed in relative fluorescence units, and the retention time was expressed in minutes. AQP4, AQP9, and β-actin PCR products were compared by integrating each peak area. Western Blot Analysis—Cells cultured under the specified conditions were harvested with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS (-)) and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g at 4 °C. For quantitation of AQP4 and AQP9 protein, cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 200 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and then sonicated on ice at 8-watt output for 10 s. Samples were kept at room temperature for 15 min with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer. For quantitation of MAPKs and phosphorylated MAPKs, the cell pellets were suspended in 150 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin) and sonicated on ice at 8-watt output for 10 s. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and boiled with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer for 5 min. For GFAP, cell pellets were suspended and sonicated as for AQPs and boiled with 5 μl of SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Total protein was measured using a BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). 3 μg of protein for AQP4 and GFAP, 20 μg for AQP9, and 30 μg for MAPKs and phosphorylated MAPKs were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and transferred to a Clear Blot Membrane-P (ATTO), which was then blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated overnight with anti-AQP4 antibody (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) diluted 1:750, anti-AQP9 antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:500, anti-p38 MAPK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:500, anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000, anti-ERK antibody (Promega) diluted 1:5000, anti-phosphorylated ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:1000, anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500, anti-phosphorylated JNK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted 1:1000, or anti-GFAP antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:1000 all in TBS-T containing 5% skim milk. After washing the membranes four times for 15 min each with TBS-T, they were incubated for 1 h with 1:1000 diluted (for AQP4, MAPKs, and GFAP) or 1:500 diluted (for AQP9) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in TBS-T buffer containing 5% skim milk. Protein was visualized using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Relative band intensities were determined by densitometry using Kodak Digital Science 1D version 2.0 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Isolation of the 5′-Flanking Regions of Human AQP4 and AQP9 Genes—The 5′-flanking region of the human AQP4 gene was isolated as described previously (44Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Genomics. 1998; 50: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The AQP4 gene is regulated by alternative promoters upstream of exons 0 and 1. The 5′-flanking regions of the exon 0 promoter (bp –1930 to +29) (nucleotide +1 corresponds to the initiation codon of exon 0) and the exon 1 promoter (bp –297 to +113) (nucleotide +1 corresponds to the initiation codon of exon 1) were subcloned into the vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), and 5′ deletion mutants were constructed. Deletion mutants corresponding to bp –1930 to +29 in the exon 0 promoter (eight constructs) and from bp –297 to +133 in the exon 1 promoter were fused to the promoterless vector PGV-B (Toyo-ink, Tokyo, Japan) containing the luciferase reporter gene. The promoter region of AQP9 (bp –1125 to +55) (nucleotide +1 corresponds to the initiation codon) was also isolated by a similar method. Briefly, the region was isolated using a Promoter Finder DNA Walking kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which contains adapter-linked human genomic DNA digested with EcoRV, ScaI, DraI, PvuII, and SspI. A two-step PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first PCR consisted of 94 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 4 min and was done in a final volume of 50 μl with 10 pmol of a specific primer, 5′-GCTCTTCAAGACCAGTCTCTGCTTGA-3′ (nucleotides +60 to +46). The second PCR was done with the same protocol using 1 μl of the first PCR product and a specific primer, 5′-CTCTGAGGACTCCTGTTTCTACCAAT-3′ (nucleotides –11 to –35). The PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1, and both strands were sequenced completely. BLAST searches were performed on the NCBI sites. The sequence was identical to GenBank™ accession number AC025431. Deletion mutants corresponding to bp –1125 to +55 in the AQP9 promoter (four constructs) were fused to the promoterless vector PGV-B. Cell Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—Reporter assays were done on AQP4 and AQP9 gene fragments fused upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter in PGV-B using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), with which the pRL-thymidine kinase (TK) plasmid (Promega) containing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the TK promoter was co-transfected as an internal control. For transient transfection, astrocytes in l-DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 48-well plate, incubated for 18 h, and transfected in serum-free medium with 0.4 μg of the test plasmid and 0.01 μg of pRL-TK using 1 μl of Lipofect-AMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 4 h, 150 μl of l-DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum was added. 48 h after transfection, equal volumes of l-DMEM or 3% mannitol in l-DMEM were added. After 24 h, the astrocytes were washed and harvested. The activities of control Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase were measured in triplicate. Induction of Hyperosmolarity in Rats—All animal studies were undertaken after the protocols were approved by the Animals Care and Use Committee of Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences. Male Wistar rats (150 g) were used throughout. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Schering-Plough Animal Health, Kenilworth, NJ) (3.2 mg/100 g, body weight) and placed under a heating lamp. Intraperitoneal infusion was performed using a modification of a technique described previously (45Bedford J.J. Leader J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: R1164-R1179PubMed Google Scholar). A polyurethane catheter (20 gauge) was inserted into the peritoneum by puncture and tightly fixed to avoid leakage of the experimental solution. The animals were then allowed to recover under a heating lamp. An isosmotic solution (121 mmol of NaCl, 5 mmol of KCl, 1 mmol of MgCl2, 1 mmol of NaH2PO4, 2 mmol of CaCl2, 18 of mmol NaHCO3, 22 mmol of glucose) or a hyperosmotic mannitol solution (1.1 mol of mannitol added to the isosmotic solution) was administered by intraperitoneal infusion using an infusion pump. The infusion rate was 1.9 ml/h, and the duration of the infusion was 1, 3, or 6 h. Control animals were anesthetized and cannulated but were not administered any solution. At the conclusion of the experiments, the animals were disconnected from the infusion pump and rapidly decapitated. Samples for Western blot analyses, done as described above, were obtained from the superficial region of the brain cortex, and cerebral sections (5 mm thick) were obtained for immunohistochemical staining. Blood samples were removed, and plasma osmotic pressure was measured by the freezing point depression method as described above. Immunohistochemical Staining—Coronal sections from the brain were embedded in paraffin by the AMeX method (46Sato Y. Mukai K. Watanabe S. Goto M. Shimosato Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 125: 431-435PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were fixed in acetone at 4 °C for 3 days, cleared in methyl benzoate and xylene, and then embedded in paraffin. Sections 3 μm thick were prepared and deparaffinized with xylene. Immunoreactivity was visualized using the streptavidin/biotin method (Histofine SAB-PO Kit, Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). After washing the sections with PBS (–), they were treated with 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. They were then immersed in a 1:20 dilution of nonimmune goat serum for 10 min to block nonspecific binding, and after blotting to remove excess serum they were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with anti-AQP4 antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:400, anti-AQP9 antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:100, or anti-GFAP antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:50 in PBS (–) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Control sections were treated with nonimmune rabbit immunoglobulins (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The sections were rinsed three times with PBS (–), incubated for 30 min each with the secondary antibody, rinsed three times, and then incubated with a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for 15 min. After washing the sections with PBS (–), the peroxidase reaction was developed by incubating them in 0.02% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) solution containing 0.003% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide and 10 mm sodium azide. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. of at least four independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way factorial analysis of variance combined with Scheffe's test for all comparison pairs. Reporter gene assays were carried out three times, and the results were analyzed by Student's t test for statistical significance. Differences with p values < 0.05 were considered significant. Induction of AQP4 and AQP9 in Cultured Rat Astrocytes Subjected to Hyperosmotic Stress—To examine the effects of hyperosmotic stress on the expression of AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs and proteins, astrocytes were incubated in isosmotic control medium (final osmotic pressure 311 ± 1.4 mOsm (n × 4)) or hyperosmotic medium supplemented with 0.3% (324 ± 1.6 mOsm), 1% (363 ± 2.7 mOsm), 3% (491 ± 4.7 mOsm), or 10% mannitol (854 ± 8.9 mOsm) for 6 h before isolation of total RNA for RT-PCR or harvesting for immunoblot analysis. Both AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs (Fig. 1A) and proteins (Fig. 1, B and C) increased significantly after treatment with 1, 3, and 10% mannitol. AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs and AQP4 protein increased maximally after treatment with 3% mannitol, whereas AQP9 protein peaked after treatment with 1% mannitol. AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs and proteins were induced to a lesser extent with 10% mannitol. To analyze the time course of the mannitol-mediated induction of AQP4 and AQP9 expression, astrocytes were treated with hyperosmotic medium containing 3% mannitol for various periods of time. AQP4 mRNA increased significantly after 1, 3, 6, and 12 h of treatment with mannitol, and AQP9 mRNA increased significantly after 3, 6, and 12 h of treatment (Fig. 2A). After 24 h, both AQP mRNAs returned to base-line levels. AQP4 and AQP9 proteins increased after 6 h of treatment with mannitol (Fig. 2, B and C). Although AQP4 mRNA returned to the base-line level after 24 h of treatment with mannitol, AQP4 protein remained at the same high level, suggesting that this gene is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. AQP9 protein peaked at 12 h but returned to the base-line level after 24 h of treatment with mannitol. To see whether hyperosmotic induction of AQP4 and AQP9 mRNAs requires de novo protein synthesis, astrocytes incubated in hyperosmotic medium containing 3% mannitol were treated with or without the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (25 μg/ml), for 6 h. The increased expression of both AQP mRNAs induced by mannitol was"

Among various described mechanisms, a toroidal pore concept was described recently in the course of action of small antimicrobial peptides. Here we provide evidence that such mechanism may be used also by larger toxins. Membrane-destabilizing effects of equinatoxin II, a sea anemone cytolysin, were studied by various biophysical techniques. 31P NMR showed an occurrence of an isotropic component when toxin was added to multilamellar vesicles and heated. This component was not observed with melittin, α-staphylococcal toxin, or myoglobin. It does not originate from isolated small lipid structures, since the size of the vesicles after the experiment was similar to the control without toxin. Electron microscopy shows occurrence of a honeycomb structure, previously observed only for some particular lipid mixtures. The analysis of FTIR spectra of the equinatoxin II-lipid complex showed lipid disordering that is consistent with isotropic component observed in NMR. Finally, the cation selectivity of the toxin-induced pores increased in the presence of negatively charged phosphatidic acid, indicating the presence of lipids in the conductive channel. The results are compatible with the toroidal pore concept that might be a general mechanism of pore formation for various membrane-interacting proteins or peptides.

Proteins and peptides with the capacity to increase membrane permeability have been elaborated by a large number of organisms and are used as toxins, effectors in immune response or apoptosis. One of the most commonly adopted mechanisms is the formation of pores in the targeted membrane as occurs, for example, with pore-forming toxins (PFT) 1The abbreviations used are: PFT, pore-forming toxin(s); DPhPC, 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine; EqtII, equinatoxin II; EM, electron microscopy; FTIR spectroscopy, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; L/P, lipid/protein ratio; MLV, multilamellar vesicles; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PLM, planar lipid membranes; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; QLS, quasielastic light scattering; SM, sphingomyelin; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles.

Bacterial PFT, protein molecules of M r > 30,000, usually follow two strategies; they either form a channel via insertion of a de novo generated transmembrane β barrel (examples are staphylococcal α-toxin, the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins, and the protective antigen of anthrax toxin), or they insert a bundle of preexisting α-helices through the membrane (like colicins and crystal δ-endotoxins) (3Heuck A.P.

Smaller molecules, like antimicrobial peptides or peptide toxins with M r between 1000 and 5000, have developed a wider set of mechanisms (5Zasloff M. Nature. 2002; 415: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6785) Google Scholar). In fact, besides the β-barrel (e.g. protegrin) (6Heller W.T. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Huang H.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17331-17338Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and the α-helix bundle (e.g. alamethicin and other peptaibols) (7Chugh J.K. Wallace B.A. Biochem. Soc.

They range from a generic destabilization (exemplified by the carpet-like model) (8Shai Y. Oren Z. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1629-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) to the formation of specific mixed lipid-peptide structures, like the toroidal pore, which was observed with magainin (9Matsuzaki K.

Actinoporins are a peculiar class of eukaryotic PFT with intermediate M r, exclusively found in sea anemones. It is a family of cysteineless proteins with M r around 18,000–20,000 and a preference for sphingomyelin (SM) (11Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). They form cation-selective pores with a diameter of ∼2 nm on cellular and model membranes (12Varanda A. Finkelstein A. J.

Biol. 2001; 183: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the soluble state of one actinoporin, equinatoxin II (EqtII; from the sea anemone Actinia equina) was recently solved by x-ray (15Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure. 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and NMR (16Hinds M.G. Zhang W. Anderluh G. Hansen P.E. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The molecule is composed of a hydrophobic β-sandwich core, flanked on the opposite sides by two α-helices. The first 30 N-terminal residues, which include one helix, are the best candidates for pore formation. This part of the molecule is amphipathic in character, is well conserved in all actinoporins, is clearly similar to some membrane-interacting peptides like melittin and fusogenic viral peptides (17Belmonte G. Menestrina G. Pederzolli C. Križaj I. Gubenšek F. Turk T. Maček P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and is the only portion of the molecule that can change conformation without disrupting the general fold (15Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure. 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence of the involvement of the N-terminal part in the formation of the transmembrane channel was obtained by a low resolution cysteine-scanning mutagenesis along the molecule (18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and by N-terminal truncations (19Anderluh G. Pungerčar J. Križaj I. Štrukelj B. Gubenšek F. Maček P. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). More recently, a complete cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of the region encompassing residues 10–28 clearly demonstrated that this portion adopts α-helical configuration in the membrane, that the α-helix is longer than in the soluble form, that it lies on the water-lipid interface in the membrane-bound state, and that it inserts into the membrane to line the pore interior, forming an angle of around 20° with the bilayer normal (20Malovrh P. Viero G. Dalla Serra M. Podlesek Z. Lakey J.H. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The slight increase in helicity that occurs upon lipid binding was already noted by FTIR spectroscopy (21Menestrina G. Cabiaux V. Tejuca M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the length of the homologous, membrane-perturbing, helical peptides. In our current model, initial binding is provided by a cluster of exposed aromatic residues (which includes Trp-112 and Trp-116) (18Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J.

Viero G. Dalla Serra M. Podlesek Z. Lakey J.H. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Hong Q.

Therefore, the number of monomers appearing in the final pore was deduced from indirect experiments. All evidence, gathered from cross-linking (13Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), steady state (12Varanda A. Finkelstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1980; 55: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and kinetic (24Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) partitioning experiments, consistently indicated a tetrameric structure. Notably, however, the pore diameter is too large to be formed by a simple bundle of four helices. One possibility to solve this apparent contradiction is to assume that the pore is partially lined by membrane lipids. In fact, perturbation of the lamellar lipid structure has been noted with some of the helical peptides similar to the N-terminal helix of actinoporins (e.g. mastoparan (25Hori Y. Demura M. Niidome T. Aoyagi H. Asakura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), staphylococcal δ-lysin (26Lohner K. Staudegger E. Prenner E.J. Lewis R.N.A.H. Kriechbaum M. Degovics G. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16514-16528Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the HIV-1 viral fusion peptide (27Pereira F.B. Valpuesta J.M. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Nieva J.L. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 103: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and some synthetic peptides with an amphipathic α-helical character (28Liu F. Lewis R.N.A.H. Hodges R.S. McElhaney R.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). In addition, a direct effect of EqtII on the lipid phase has been recently observed and attributed to the separation of a sphingomyelin-enriched phase and to vesiculation (29Bonev B.B. Lam Y.H. Anderluh G. Watts A. Norton R.S. Separovic F. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2382-2392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Given its similarity with melittin, we suspected that the N-terminal helix of actinoporins could perturb the membrane by giving rise to the formation of a toroidal protein-lipid pore. Direct functional evidence for such a structure was already provided by the toxin-strengthening effect of lipids that favor the positive curvature appearing at the center of the toroidal pore and by the fact that pore formation induced the mobilization of lipid molecules between the two leaflets of the bilayer (30Alvarez C. Dalla Serra M. Potrich C. Bernhart I. Tejuca M. Martinez D. Pazos I.F. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2761-2774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report a new investigation of EqtII effects on membrane order, providing original evidence that it can affect the lipid phase by a peculiar mechanism, previously observed only in some specific lipid mixtures. Such a mechanism, which is consistent with the concept that its biological activity is exerted via the formation of a toroidal protein-lipid pore, represents a novel paradigm of protein-induced membrane destabilization. Toxins, Proteins, and Lipids—Native EqtII was isolated from the sea anemones as described (31Maček P. Lebez D. Toxicon. 1988; 26: 441-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Melittin (65–85% pure by high pressure liquid chromatography) and myoglobin (type II, minimum 90%, from whale muscle) were from Sigma; pure α-toxin from Staphylococcus aureus was a kind gift of Dr. Hungerer (Behringwerk, Marburg, Germany). Lipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (DPhPC), phosphatidic acid (PA), egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), and brain SM, were all obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lipid Vesicle Preparations—PC, POPC, and cholesterol were dissolved in chloroform, SM in chloroform/ethanol (4:1, v/v). Lipid mixtures were vacuum-dried in a film at the bottom of a round flask and further treated in a speed-vac for 1–2 h. The lipid films were resuspended at room temperature by vigorously vortexing in the appropriate buffer, followed by six cycles of freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. Such dispersions of multilamellar vesicles (MLV) were either immediately used as such or were extruded through polycarbonate membranes with pores of diameter 400 or 600 nm to prepare large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of that size. Alternatively, small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonicating the MLV on ice for 30 min, followed by gentle sedimentation to remove titanium particles released by the sonotrode. Lipid samples with PFT or myoglobin, were prepared similarly except that the buffer used for lipid hydration contained appropriate amounts of the proteins. For actinoporins, mixture POPC/SM or PC/SM in a molar ratio of 1:1 or 2:1 was used, since these two mixtures are the most sensitive in functional assays for binding and permeabilization (13Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For the same reason, we used POPC/cholesterol in a molar ratio of 1:1 with α-toxin (32Forti S. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NMR Spectra— 31P NMR spectra of the different lipid and lipid/toxin preparations were recorded at 121.4 MHz on a Varian XL-300 spectrometer. Lipid composition was POPC/SM 2:1 (mol/mol), and lipid concentration was 30 mm in 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 (NMR buffer). 0.4–0.7 ml of the sample were placed in 5-mm Pyrex NMR tubes. Two different protocols were used (as indicated). The phase-cycled Hahn echo pulse sequence was used on samples that were supplemented with 10% deuterated water to provide an internal lock frequency control (33Rance M. Byrd R.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 52: 221-240Google Scholar). Recycle time was 2 s, 90° pulse width was 30 μs, delay between pulses was 100 μs, sweep width was 38.46 kHz, acquisition time was 0.104 s, and transient number was 2000–10,000. Alternatively, spectra were acquired by the single pulse acquisition technique (60° pulse angle and 0.4-s interpulse time) on samples without deuterated water. 2000–4000 transients were used in this case. In all measurements, 8192 complex data points were acquired and exponentially multiplied with 75 Hz prior to Fourier transformation with continuous wave 1H-decoupling during data acquisition. 31P chemical shifts were measured relative to 0.0 ppm indicated by sonicated unilamellar vesicles. Variable temperatures were obtained with a homemade temperature-control unit that was calibrated on the chemical shift difference between the residual OH and CD2H proton of 99.8% deuterated methanol (temperature accuracy ±0.2 °C). Samples were left 10 min to equilibrate after each change of temperature Measurement of Vesicle Size by Quasielastic Light Scattering (QLS)— MLV, LUV, and SUV size was determined by QLS (34Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) at a fixed angle (90°) and room temperature, using a laser particle sizer (Malvern Z-sizer 3) equipped with a 5-milliwatt helium-neon laser. For this assay, lipid samples were diluted in NMR buffer to give similar scattering (from 25 to 250 times, depending on their size). A 64-channel correlator was used capable of particle size estimates in the range of 5–5000 nm. Data were analyzed by the cumulant method using Malvern Application Software. The first cumulant provided the apparent diffusion coefficient of the particles (from which the hydrodynamic radius can be derived by the Stokes-Einstein relation), whereas the second cumulant gave the distribution width (35Santos N.C. Castanho M.A.R.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1641-1650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Permeabilization of Lipid Vesicles—Permeabilization was assayed by measuring the leakage of calcein (36Kayalar C. Düzgünes N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MLV were prepared as above, but in the presence of 80 mm calcein (pH 7.0 with NaOH). The external calcein was removed by spinning through minicolumns (Pierce) loaded with Sephadex G50 medium preequilibrated with NMR buffer. Fluorescence was measured in a spectrofluorimeter (SPEX Fluoromax) using a 1-cm semimicroquartz cuvette with 1 ml of NMR buffer with 1 μm lipids continuously stirred. Lysins were added to vesicles at a lipid/protein (or peptide) molar ratio of 1. Excitation wavelength was set to 485 nm, and emission was set to 520 nm with both slits set to 2 nm. Release of calcein (R), a percentage, was calculated according to Equation 1, R=(Fmeas-Finit)/(Fmax-Finit)·100(Eq. 1) where F meas, F init, and F max are the measured, initial, and maximal fluorescence, respectively. F max was obtained by the addition of Triton X-100 to 1 mm final concentration. Spontaneous leakage was negligible on this time scale. The experiments were run at room temperature. Electron Microscopy (EM)—Transmission EM was performed with a Philips CM100 microscope operating at 80 kV. A drop of the sample was deposited on the copper grids coated with formvar film and negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (Sigma). Samples were dried on air before imaging. Images were taken with a BioScan Camera model 792 (Gatan) with CCD resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. For size estimation, samples were imaged after the NMR experiment. The dimensions were estimated by measuring the diameter of vesicles from the EM image. Averages for MLV and MLV with EqtII were obtained after fitting dimensions to Gaussian distribution. Averages for MLV with melittin were calculated from the data, since the distribution was not Gaussian in that case. Preparation of Vesicles for Infrared Spectroscopy—SUV were prepared as above with POPC/SM (1:1) (5 mg/ml) for EqtII and PC/cholesterol (1:1) (6 mg/ml) for α-toxin. EqtII was applied at a lipid/protein ratio (L/P) of 100. Unbound toxin, estimated by the residual hemolytic activity, was between 5 and 10% and was not removed. Samples were applied straight to the germanium crystal. α-Toxin was used at L/P of 200 and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Free toxin (∼35%, as determined by hemolytic activity) was removed by repeated ultrafiltration through polysulfone filters of 300-kDa cut-off (NMWL; Millipore Corp.) as described (37Ferreras M. Höper F. Dalla Serra M. Colin D.A. Prévost G. Menestrina G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1414: 108-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All preparations were in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. FTIR—FTIR spectra were collected in the attenuated total reflection configuration, as described (21Menestrina G. Cabiaux V. Tejuca M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), on a Bio-Rad FTS 185 spectrometer with a deuterium triglycine sulfate detector and KBr beam splitter, at a nominal resolution of 0.5 cm–1. Three kinds of spectra were taken: toxin alone, lipid alone (SUV of either PC/SM 1:1 or PC/cholesterol 1:1), or toxin-treated SUV. The samples were spread on a 10-reflection germanium crystal (45° cut), flushed with D2O-saturated nitrogen, and housed in a vertical attenuated total reflection attachment (by Specac). Polarized spectra were collected with a rotating wire grid polarizer (fir grid; Specac), manually positioned either parallel (0°) or perpendicular (90°) to the plane of the internal reflections. The orientation of a structural element was calculated from the dichroic ratio, R = A 0°/A 90°, where A 0° and A 90° are the absorption bands of the functional group of that element in the parallel and perpendicular configuration, respectively (38Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 39Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The form factor, S, was derived from R using Equation 2 (40Axelsen P.H. Kaufman B.K. McElhaney R.N. Lewis R.N.A.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2770-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), S=Ex2-REy2+Ez212(3cos2θ-1)(Ex2-REy2-2Ez2)(Eq. 2) where θ represents the angle between the long axis of the molecule under consideration and the transition moment of the investigated vibration; Ex, Ey , and Ez are the components of the electric field of the evanescent wave in the three directions (the z axis being perpendicular to the plane of the crystal), which we calculated according to Harrick expressions for thick films (40Axelsen P.H.

Harrick Scientific Corp., Ossining, NY1967Google Scholar). The following order parameters were calculated: (a) S L, for the lipid chains, using either the symmetric or asymmetric CH2 stretching (bands centered at 2850 and 2920 cm–1, respectively) and θ = 90°; (b) S amide I′, for the amide I′ band (integrated between 1600 and 1700 cm–1) with θ = 0° (42Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7720-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); and (c) S α, for the α-helix, using the Lorentzian component at 1651 ± 1 cm–1, obtained by deconvoluting and curve-fitting the amide I′ band (between 1700 and 1600 cm–1) as previously described (21Menestrina G. Cabiaux V. Tejuca M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and using θ = 39° (38Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). To analyze the amide I′ band of the lipid-bound toxin, the spectra were previously corrected by subtracting the contribution of the lipid alone, with a weight that eliminates the stretching band of the phospholipid carboxyl groups at 1738 cm–1. From the order parameter, we calculated the average tilt angle γ of the molecular axis with respect to the z axis according to Equation 3 (40Axelsen P.H. Kaufman B.K. McElhaney R.N. Lewis R.N.A.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2770-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), S=12(3cos2γ-1)(Eq. 3) By definition, S represents the fraction of molecules aligned with the axis direction, whereas (1 – S) is the fraction remaining disordered. The mean angle σ of the α-helix axis with respect to the direction of the lipid chains was recalculated from Equation 4 (40Axelsen P.H. Kaufman B.K. McElhaney R.N. Lewis R.N.A.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2770-2781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Sα12(3cos2γL-1)=12(3cos2σ-1)(Eq. 4) where γL is the angle formed by the lipid chains with the z axis. Finally, the lipid to bound toxin ratio (L/Pb) was calculated from A 90° according to Equation 5 (42Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7720-7726Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), L/Pb=0.208(nres-1)(1-SamideI')(1+SL/2)·∫28002980A90∘(νL)dν∫16001690A90∘(νamideI')dν(Eq. 5) where n res represents the total number of residues in the toxin (179 for EqtII and 293 for α-toxin). Determination of Ion Selectivity of the EqtII Channel—Electrical properties of EqtII pores were studied using planar lipid membranes (PLM) exactly as described (20Malovrh P. Viero G. Dalla Serra M. Podlesek Z. Lakey J.H. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22678-22685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On a weight basis, PLM were made of 20% SM, (80 – x)% of DPhPC and x% PA, with x ranging from 0 to 20. EqtII was added at nanomolar concentration only to the cis side, where voltage was applied. Reversal voltages were measured in a 10-fold KCl gradient and translated into a permeability ratio P +/P – (where P + and P – refer to cation and anion permeability, respectively) by the Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz equation. Initially, both sides (volume of 2 ml) were bathed by symmetrical solution of 10 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, pH 8.0. Thereafter, the trans side was perfused with 10 volumes of 10 mm Tris, 1 m KCl, pH 8.0. Effects of EqtII on Lipid Isotropy: NMR—The effects of equinatoxin (EqtII) on lipid membranes were first studied by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Initially, pure lipid samples were examined in order to find the most suitable preparation. Four different kinds of vesicles were compared (SUV, LUV400, LUV600, and MLV), which share the same bilayer organization but have quite different size, as shown by QLS (Table I). Ideally, the lipid preparation should display a pure lamellar phase signal so that any toxin-induced change of lipid organization (e.g. from lamellar to hexagonal or isotropic phases) (43Seddon J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 44Cullis P.R. Hope M.J. de Kruijff B. Verkleij A.J. Tilcock C.P. Kuo J.F. Phospholipids and Cellular Regulation. Vol. 1. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1985: 1-59Google Scholar) could be detected. Only MLV approximated this behavior, showing, even at the higher temperature, a clear predominance of the broad asymmetric 31P NMR spectra (with low field shoulder) typical of the lamellar phase over a small isomorphic signal (Fig. 1). All other preparations showed the occurrence of a peak around 0 ppm, suggesting the presence of a population of fast tumbling phospholipid molecules, which was predominant, at least at the higher temperature. Clearly, the amount of isotropic phase was inversely correlated to the size of the vesicles and directly related to the temperature. For these reasons, as in other works (25Hori Y. Demura M. Niidome T. Aoyagi H. Asakura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Lohner K. Staudegger E. Prenner E.J. Lewis R.N.A.H. Kriechbaum M. Degovics G. McElhaney R.N.

https://openalex.org/W2038619560,"Tumor-associated mutant forms of p53 can exert an antiapoptotic gain of function activity, which probably confers a selective advantage upon tumor cells harboring such mutations. We report that mutant p53 suppresses the expression of the CD95 (Fas/APO-1) gene, encoding a death receptor implicated in a variety of apoptotic responses. Moderate (40-50%) downregulation of CD95 mRNA and surface protein expression by mutant p53 correlates with partial protection against CD95-dependent cell death. Excess mutant p53 represses the transcriptional activity of the CD95 promoter, with the extent of repression varying among different tumor-associated p53 mutants. Furthermore, mutant p53 protein binds the CD95 promoter in vitro, in a region distinct from the one implicated in tight interactions of the CD95 gene with wild-type p53. Hence, the CD95 promoter is likely to be a direct target for downregulation by mutant p53. This activity of mutant p53 may contribute to its gain of function effects in oncogenesis."

To further investigate the effects of resistin on glucose metabolism, we derived a novel transgenic strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats expressing the mouse resistin gene under the control of the fat-specific aP2 promoter and also performed in vitro studies of the effects of recombinant resistin on glucose metabolism in isolated skeletal muscle. Expression of the resistin transgene was detected by Northern blot analysis in adipose tissue and by real-time PCR in skeletal muscle and was associated with increased serum fatty acids and muscle triglycerides, impaired skeletal muscle glucose metabolism, and glucose intolerance in the absence of any changes in serum resistin concentrations. In skeletal muscle isolated from non-transgenic spontaneously hypertensive rats, in vitro incubation with recombinant resistin significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogenesis and reduced glucose oxidation. These findings raise the possibility that autocrine effects of resistin in adipocytes, leading to release of other prodiabetic effector molecules from fat and/or paracrine actions of resistin secreted by adipocytes embedded within skeletal muscle, may contribute to the pathogenesis of disordered skeletal muscle glucose metabolism and impaired glucose tolerance.

In industrialized societies, type 2 diabetes is a common cause of morbidity and mortality that is characterized by insulin resistance often in association with central obesity. However, the mechanisms that underlie the widely recognized relationship between obesity and insulin resistance remain to be defined. Although skeletal muscles are quantitatively the most important site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (1DeFronzo D.J. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar), adipose tissue clearly exerts a major influence on carbohydrate metabolism because changes in body fat mass can have substantial effects on insulin action and glucose tolerance. Moreover, recent studies demonstrating that adipose tissue can secrete a number of molecules that modulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism strongly suggest that body fat is more than just a passive reservoir for fuel in the form of triglycerides. Recently, a new hormone produced by fat cells and termed resistin was discovered that could represent an important link between obesity and insulin-resistant diabetes (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T.

Resistin is a cysteine-rich polypeptide expressed primarily in white adipose tissue that is induced during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis and may also serve as a feedback regulator to inhibit adipocyte generation (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar, 3Holcomb I.N. Kabakoff R.C. Chan B.

Message and protein levels of resistin are decreased by fasting and increased by refeeding, possibly in response to changes in insulin levels (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J.

Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar) have found that treatment of mice with recombinant resistin can impair glucose tolerance and that administration of anti-resistin antibody improves blood glucose and insulin action in mice with diet-induced obesity (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with recombinant resistin has also been reported to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). In addition, resistin mRNA levels can be suppressed by exposure to either fatty acids or ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). However, in various rodent models of obesity, conflicting results have been reported regarding the effects of systemically administered peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ligands on resistin expression, perhaps because of the fact that these ligands can influence a host of factors that may differentially regulate resistin (5Banerjee R.R.

Based on measurements of resistin expression in fat tissue in humans and in animals with type 2 diabetes and or obesity, a number of investigators have recently raised questions regarding the potential relevance of resistin to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. For example, whereas some investigators have found evidence of resistin expression in samples of human subcutaneous and abdominal fat (9McTernan C.L. McTernan P.G. Harte A.L. Levick P.L. Barnett A.H. Kumar S. Lancet. 2002; 359: 46-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 10Savage D.B. Sewter C.P. Klenk E.S. Segal D.G. Vidal-Puig A. Considine R.V. O'Rahilly S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2199-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), others have found it difficult to detect mRNA for resistin in either adipocytes or subcutaneous adipose tissue isolated from insulin-resistant subjects (11Nagaev I. Smith U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Expression of resistin in white adipose tissue has also been reported to be significantly decreased in several animal models of obesity-associated insulin resistance (6Juan C.C. Au L.C. Fang V.S. Kang S.F. Ko Y.H. Kuo S.F. Hsu Y.P. Kwok C.F. Ho L.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Fukui Y. Motojima K. Diabetes Obes.

Commun. 2002; 298: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the lack of correlation between resistin mRNA levels in isolated adipocytes and insulin resistance does not exclude the possibility that resistin may be contributing to the pathogenesis of disordered carbohydrate metabolism in either liver or skeletal muscle. In Sprague-Dawley rats, intra-arterial infusion of recombinant resistin over a period of 5 h has recently been reported to promote glucose intolerance by impairing insulin action on hepatic glucose metabolism (14Rajala M.W. Obici S. Scherer P.E. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This observation raises the possibility that local secretion of resistin-like molecules into the portal venous circulation might play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. It is also conceivable that paracrine effects of resistin produced by adipocytes embedded deep within skeletal muscle might contribute to the pathogenesis of impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of changes in either circulating levels of resistin or resistin expression in visceral or superficial subcutaneous fat. However, few studies have been performed to directly investigate the effects of resistin on skeletal muscle glucose metabolism or the relationship between circulating levels of resistin and glucose tolerance. In this study, we investigated the chronic effects of resistin on glucose metabolism in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), 1The abbreviations used are: SHR, spontaneously hypertensive rat; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; OGTT, oral glucose tolerance test. a widely studied animal model of the hypertension metabolic syndrome that is predisposed to insulin resistance due at least in part to a genetic defect in the CD36 fatty acid transporter (15Pravenec M.

Genet. 2001; 27: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have found that transgenic expression of the mouse resistin gene under the control of the aP2 promoter in the SHR induces dyslipidema and increased muscle triglycerides, impairs oxidative and non-oxidative glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, and promotes glucose intolerance in the absence of detectable changes in circulating levels of resistin or insulin. In addition, we observed that recombinant resistin can inhibit glucose oxidation and insulin-stimulated glycogenesis in freshly isolated soleus muscle from non-transgenic SHR. These findings raise the possibility that paracrine actions of resistin secreted by adipocytes embedded within skeletal muscle or autocrine effects of resistin in adipocytes leading to the release of other prodiabetic effector molecules from fat or both may contribute to the pathogenesis of disordered skeletal muscle glucose metabolism and impaired glucose tolerance. Animals—The resistin transgene was expressed on the genetic background of the SHR/Ola strain (15Pravenec M. Zídek V. Šimáková M. Kren V. Krenová D. Horký K. Jáchymová M. Míková B.

The rats were housed in an air-conditioned animal facility and allowed free access to food and water. Metabolic phenotypes were assessed in male control SHR (n = 10) and male resistin-transgenic SHR (n = 10) after the rats were fed a diet with 60% fructose (K4102.0 diet, Hope Farms, Woerden, The Netherlands) from the age of 8 weeks for 15 days. All of the experiments were performed in agreement with the Animal Protection Law of the Czech Republic (311/1997) and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Physiology, Czech Academy of Sciences (Prague, Czech Republic). Transgenic Strain Derivation—Transgenic SHR were derived by microinjection of zygotes with a mouse resistin cDNA construct that was prepared by reverse transcriptase PCR of RNA from fat tissue of a BALB/c mouse. Resistin primers were designed according to the published resistin sequence (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S. Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). The construct contained, in addition to cDNA of the mouse resistin gene, rabbit β-globin intron 2, a growth hormone poly(A) signal and the fat-specific aP2 promoter vector (kindly provided by Dr. Farid Chehab, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Microinjections of recombinant DNA into one or both pro-nuclei of fertilized ova were done according to Charreau et al. (18Charreau B. Menoret S. Tesson L. Soulillou J.-P. Anegon I. Rat Genome. 1997; 3: 125-132Google Scholar). Transgenic rats were detected by PCR using primers specific for the mouse resistin gene: upstream, 5′-tca aca aga agg agc tgt gg-3′, and downstream, 5′-cca gcc tgt ttt gtt tta ttt-′3. The official designation of the new resistin-transgenic strain is SHR/Ola-TgN(Retn)201Ipcv (abbreviated herein as the SHR-TG strain). Gene Expression Analysis of Transgenic SHR Rats—Northern blot analysis was used to confirm expression of the mouse resistin transgene and endogenous rat resistin gene in adipose tissue. The probe for Northern analysis was prepared by random primer labeling of the first 580 bp of the mouse resistin gene cut and purified from the transgene construct. Real-time PCR analysis was used to test for possible expression of the mouse resistin transgene in skeletal muscle. The cyclophilin (peptidylprolyl isomerase A) gene was used as an internal control with expression of the mouse resistin transgene relative to cyclophilin being determined in triplicate using the preferred method of Muller et al. (19Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1372-1379PubMed Google Scholar, 20Muller P.Y. Janovjak H. Miserez A.R. Dobbie Z. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 514Google Scholar). The cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of soleus muscle mRNA using random primers followed by real-time PCR amplification using QuantiTect SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) on an Opticon continuous fluorescence detector (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The upstream primers were 5′-caa atg ctg gac cca aca ca-3′ (cyclophilin A) and 5′-aga agg cac agc agt ctt-3′ (mouse resistin). The downstream primers were 5′-tgc cat cca acc act cag tc-3′ (cyclophilin A) and 5′-tgt cca gtc tat cct tgc a-3′ (mouse resistin). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were extracted from 2 g of epididymal fat. Fat tissue was homogenized with 4 ml of ice-cold extracting buffer (0.3 m Tris-Cl, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.03 m KCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.4) and 80 μl of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian tissues, Sigma) for 1 min on ice. The samples then were agitated for 1 min by vortex and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min, 5300 × g, at 4 °C. The water phase was used as a protein extract. For SDS electrophoresis, the protein extracts were agitated with 2 volumes of sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (Laemmli buffer system according to Mini-PROTEAN 3 cell instruction manual from Bio-Rad) and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded on polyacrylamide gel (4% stacking gel and 13% resolving gel), and the electrophoresis was run at 70 V. The load of samples was 30 μl. For Western blotting, a wet protein transfer was done using Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) with transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% v/v methanol, 0.5% w/v SDS, pH 8.3) and nitrocellulose membrane (pore size 0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). Conditions were 30 V for 16 h at 4 °C. The membrane was blocked in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Sigma), containing 3% nonfat dry milk (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Resistin protein was detected with a rabbit anti-mouse resistin antibody (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc., San Antonio, TX). This antibody does not distinguish between mouse and rat resistin. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as a secondary antibody. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.5% nonfat dry milk. The incubation with the primary antibody was overnight at 4 °C and with the conjugate for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane then was treated with the ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and the signal was detected using the Luminiscent Image analysis system (LAS-1000+, Fuji) and quantified by AIDA image analyzer program (Raytest). Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing—Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed using a glucose load of 300 mg/100 g body weight after 7 h of fasting. Blood was drawn from the tail without anesthesia before the glucose load (0-min time point) and at 30, 60, and 120 min thereafter. Skeletal Muscle Glycogen Synthesis and Glucose Oxidation—Glycogen synthesis and glucose oxidation were determined in isolated soleus muscle by measuring the incorporation of [14C-U]glucose into glycogen and CO2 as described previously (21Vrána A. Poledne R. Fábry P. Kazdová L. Metabolism. 1978; 27: 885-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Qi N. Kazdová L. Zídek V. Landa V. Kren V. Pershadsingh H.A. St. Lezin E. Abumrad N.A. Pravenec M. Kurtz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48501-48507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The soleus muscles were attached to a stainless steel frame in situ at in vivo length by special clips and separated from other muscles and tendons and immediately incubated for 2 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, that contained 5.5 mm unlabeled glucose, 0.5 μCi/ml [14C-U]glucose, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Armour, Fraction V) with or without 250 microunits/ml insulin. After a 2-h incubation, 0.3 ml of 1 m hyamine hydroxide was injected into central compartment of the incubation vessel and 0.5 ml of 1 m H2SO4 was injected into the main compartment to liberate CO2. The vessels were incubated for another 30 min, and the hyamine hydroxide was then quantitatively transferred into the scintillation vial containing 10 ml of toluene-based scintillation fluid for counting of radioactivity. For measurement of insulin-stimulated incorporation of glucose into glycogen, glycogen was extracted and glucose incorporation into glycogen was determined as described previously (21Vrána A. Poledne R. Fábry P. Kazdová L. Metabolism. 1978; 27: 885-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Qi N. Kazdová L. Zídek V. Landa V. Kren V. Pershadsingh H.A. St. Lezin E.

Tissue Triglyceride Measurements—For determination of triglycerides in liver and soleus muscle, tissues were powdered under liquid N2 and extracted for 16 h in chloroform:methanol, after which 2% KH2PO4 was added and the solution was centrifuged. The organic phase was removed and evaporated under N2. The resulting pellet was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol, and triglyceride content was determined by enzymatic assay (Pliva-Lachema, Brno, Czech Republic). Effects of Recombinant Resistin on Insulin-stimulated Glucose Oxidation and Glycogen Synthesis in Skeletal Muscle Isolated from the SHR—Glycogenesis and glucose oxidation were measured as described above in soleus muscles isolated from 7-week-old male SHR/Ola (n = 5/each group) fed standard laboratory chow. Recombinant resistin (Alpha Diagnostic International, Inc.) was added to incubation media at a concentration of 600 ng/ml. Biochemical Analyses—Blood glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase assay (Pliva-Lachema) using tail vein blood drawn into 5% trichloroacetic acid and promptly centrifuged. Serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were determined using an acyl-CoA oxidase-based colorimetric kit (Roche Diagnostics). Serum triglyceride concentrations were measured by standard enzymatic methods (Pliva-Lachema). Serum insulin concentrations were determined using a rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Serum levels of leptin were determined using a rat leptin radioimmunoassay kit from Linco Research (St. Charles, MO). Serum resistin concentrations were determined at Linco Research, Inc. with an immunoassay that cross-reacts with mouse and rat resistin (Linco Research, Inc.). Statistical Analysis—All of the data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between control and experimental groups were evaluated by paired or non-paired Student's t tests as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Transgenic Expression of Resistin—Transgene-positive SHR and transgene-negative controls were identified by genotyping offspring derived from crosses of a founder male with transgene-negative SHR females. In the epididymal fat from the SHR transgene-positive line, Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of both the mouse resistin transgene and the endogenous rat resistin gene (Fig. 1a). The transgene-negative controls showed expression of only the endogenous rat resistin gene. Fig. 1a shows the presence of the 0.8- and 1.4-kb pair transcripts that are characteristic of endogenous rat resistin in both the transgene-positive SHR and in a transgene-negative control. These two transcripts are similar in size to those previously reported for the rat, which is known to express two resistin transcripts, whereas the mouse expresses only one resistin transcript (4Kim K.H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In the SHR-transgenic line, a single transcript for the mouse resistin transgene could be detected in moderate amounts that is distinct in size from the endogenous rat resistin transcripts and that is slightly larger than the wild type mouse resistin transcript because of its longer 3′-untranslated tail. In addition to detecting mRNA for the mouse resistin transgene by Northern blot analysis in epididymal fat from the transgenic strain, we were able to detect low level skeletal muscle expression of the mouse resistin transgene relative to that of cyclophilin by real-time PCR (Fig. 1b). Transgene-negative controls showed no expression of the mouse resistin gene in fat or muscle when tested by either Northern blot analysis or real-time PCR. Western blot analysis of adipose tissue demonstrated greater expression of resistin protein in the transgene-positive rats than in transgene-negative controls (Fig. 1c). Effects of Resistin Transgene on Body Weight, Serum Phenotypes, and Tissue Lipid Levels—At the time of sacrifice, there were no significant differences between transgene-positive rats and transgene-negative controls with respect to either body weight or epididymal fat weight (Table I). Serum resistin levels were similar between SHR transgene-positive rats and transgene-negative controls as measured by an immunoassay that cross-reacts with mouse and rat resistin (Table I). Serum concentrations of insulin and glucose in transgene-positive rats, 1.2 ± 0.10 nmol/liter and 6.7 ± 0.2 mmol/liter, were similar to those in transgene-negative controls, 1.2 ± 0.13 nmol/liter and 6.8 ± 0. 2 mmol/liter, respectively. In transgene-positive rats, serum levels of leptin, 3.8 ± 0.8 ng/ml, were also not different compared with those in transgene negative controls, 3.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml. In contrast, serum concentrations of NEFA were significantly increased in transgenic animals compared with controls (Fig. 2a). Increased serum NEFA levels were also observed in the transgene-positive rats during the oral glucose tolerance test (Fig. 2a). In the transgene-positive rats, the increased serum NEFA levels were associated with increased muscle triglycerides (Fig. 2b), whereas no differences in hepatic triglycerides were observed between the transgene-positive rats (16.4 ± 0.7 μmol/g) and the transgene-negative controls (16.4 ± 0.6 μmol/g).Table IBody weights, relative epididymal fat weights, and serum resistin concentrationsStrainBody weightEpididymal fat weightSerum resistingg/100 g body weightng/mlSHR control280 ± 31.05 ± 0.0521.8 ± 2.6SHR-TG278 ± 61.05 ± 0.0621.5 ± 2.4 Open table in a new tab Effects of Resistin Transgene on Oral Glucose Tolerance— The resistin-transgenic rats displayed impaired oral glucose tolerance (Fig. 3) with the area under the glucose tolerance curve being significantly greater in the transgene-positive line than in the transgene-negative controls (831 ± 13 mmol/2 h and 760 ± 12 mmol/2 h, respectively; p < 0.005) (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the studies of Steppan et al. (2Steppan C.M. Bailey S.T. Bhat S. Brown E.J. Banerjee R.R. Wright C.M. Patel H.R. Ahima R.S.

Effects of Resistin Transgene on Skeletal Muscle Glucose Metabolism—In soleus muscle isolated from transgenic SHR expressing the mouse resistin gene, glycogenesis and glucose oxidation were significantly reduced in both the presence and absence of insulin (Fig. 4, a and b). Thus, both non-oxidative and oxidative glucose metabolism were impaired in skeletal muscle of transgenic rats compared with controls. These findings are in accord with the recent studies of Moon et al. (23Moon B. Kwan J.J. Duddy N. Sweeney G. Begum N. Am. J.

https://openalex.org/W1987898954,"Dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), a VH1-like enzyme that hydrolyses nuclear substrates phosphorylated on both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, has a potential role in deactivation of mitogen- or stress-activated protein kinases. Using cDNA-microarray technology, we found that the expression of DUSP5 mRNA was dramatically increased by exogenous p53 in U373MG, a p53-mutant glioblastoma cell line. Transcription of DUSP5 was also remarkably activated by endogenous p53 in response to DNA damage in colon-cancer cells (p53+/+) that contained wild-type p53, but not in p53-/- cells. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and reporter assays demonstrated that endogenous p53 protein would bind directly to the promoter region of the DUSP5 gene, implying p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Overexpression of DUSP5 suppressed the growth of several types of human cancer cells, in which Erk1/2 was significantly dephosphorylated. If, as the results suggest, DUSP5 is a direct target of p53, it represents a novel mechanism by which p53 might negatively regulate cell-cycle progression by downregulating mitogen- or stress-activated protein kinases."

Although the involvement of GCs in osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation has been studied extensively, their direct action on osteoclasts is still controversial and not conclusive. In this study, we investigated the direct participation of GCs in osteoclastogenesis. Dexamethasone (Dex) at <10–8m stimulated, but at >10–7m depressed, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast formation synergistically with transforming growth factor-β. The stimulatory action of Dex was restricted to the early phase of osteoclast differentiation and enhanced the priming of osteoclast progenitors (bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages) toward differentiation into cells of the osteoclast lineage. The osteoclast differentiation depending on RANKL requires the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, and the DNA binding of these transcription factors to their respective consensus cis-elements was enhanced by Dex, consistent with the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis. However, Dex did not affect the RANKL-induced signaling pathways such as the activation of IκB kinase followed by NF-κB nuclear translocation or the activation of JNK. On the other hand, Dex significantly decreased the endogenous production of interferon-β, and this cytokine depressed the RANKL-elicited DNA binding of NF-κB and AP-1, as well as osteoclast formation. Thus, the down-regulation of inhibitory cytokines such as interferon-β by Dex may allow the osteoclast progenitors to be freed from the suppression of osteoclastogenesis, resulting in an increased number of osteoclasts, as is observed in the early phase of GC-induced osteoporosis.

Besides these proteins, a variety of local cytokines participate in regulating osteoclast differentiation (3Chambers T.J. J. Clin.

These immune mediators such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferons (IFNs) can be categorized into different groups based on their stimulatory or inhibitory effects and their direct or indirect action on osteoclast differentiation (12Palmqvist P.

Thus, osteoclast differentiation is governed by a delicate balance between the above stimulatory and inhibitory cytokines. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have a multitude of effects on the immune response at several sites and are both anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive when administered therapeutically (19Pitzalis C. Pipitone N. Perretti M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 966: 108-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 20Langenegger T. Michel B.A. Clin.

Therapie. 2000; 55: 165-169PubMed Google Scholar). Although GCs are effective for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases to acute situations such as spinal cord injury, long-term therapy with GCs causes osteoporosis, resulting in severe bone loss that, at present, has become a big clinical problem (22Canalis E. Delany A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 966: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 23Weinstein R.S. Rev. Endocr. Metab.

Weinstein R.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). GCs decrease calcium absorption in the gastrointestinal system and increase calcium excretion in the renal system, resulting in a high level of parathyroid hormone (26Bikle D.D. Halloran B. Fong L. Steinbach L. Shellito J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Klein R.G. Arnaud S.B. Gallagher J.C. Deluca H.F. Riggs B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Therefore, GC-induced osteoporosis has been accepted for a long time to be caused by the secondary hyperparathyroidism (26Bikle D.D. Halloran B. Fong L. Steinbach L. Shellito J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, another possible mechanism for GC-induced osteoporosis is that GCs decrease gonadotropin production, which may result in increased bone resorption because of estrogen deficiency (28Michael A.E. Cooke B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Jilka R.L. Hangoc G. Girasole G. Passeri G. Williams D.C. Abrams J.S. Boyce B. Broxmeyer H. Manolagas S.C. Science. 1992; 257: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence, however, indicates that elevated levels of parathyroid hormone or subnormal vitamin D metabolite concentrations are not typical of patients receiving GC therapy, and there is no direct evidence indicating that GC-induced hypogonadism is responsible for the enhanced bone resorption, thus suggesting the existence of some other mechanism for GC-induced bone loss (30Paz-Pacheco E. Fuleihan G.E. LeBoff M.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1713-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many in vitro studies have indicated the direct action of GCs on osteoblasts (31Chyun Y.S. Kream B.E. Raisz L.G.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1006-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) show that GC acts directly on osteoblasts to up-regulate the expression of RANKL and M-CSF and that the steroid oppositely down-regulates osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor of RANKL that prevents the transmission of the RANKL signal into cells of the osteoclast lineage. This regulation is likely to be a mechanism for induction of bone resorption by GCs. However, direct effects of GCs on osteoclasts are controversial and are not conclusive (36Shuto T. Kukita T. Hirata M. Jimi E. Koga T. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Kaji H. Sugimoto T. Kanatani M. Nishiyama K. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner.

The aim of this study was to evaluate precisely the direct action of GCs on osteoclast differentiation and to determine the point of GC action in the process of osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we found that dexamethasone (Dex), at low concentrations (<10–8m), enhanced RANKL-induced osteoclast formation synergistically with TGF-β by stimulating the priming of bone marrow-derived M/MØ as osteoclast progenitors for differentiation toward osteoclasts. Although numerous studies (39Adcock I.M. Caramori G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 40Jenkins B.D. Pullen C.B. Darimont B.D. Trends Endocrinol.

Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated the negative regulation of NF-κB and AP-1 activation by GCs as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, the enhancement of osteoclastogenesis was accompanied by the additional activation by Dex of these transcription factors evoked by RANKL. However, Dex did not influence the signaling pathways from RANK by which these transcription factors are translocated into nucleus. On the other hand, Dex significantly depressed the endogenous production of a type-I IFN, IFN-β. IFN-β potently inhibited osteoclastogenesis, as demonstrated previously (17Hayashi T. Kaneda T. Toyama Y. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Takayanagi H. Kim S. Matsuo K. Suzuki H. Suzuki T. Sato K.

Nature. 2002; 416: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and the cytokine depressed the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in osteoclast progenitors. Thus, down-regulation of the inhibitory cytokines such as IFN-β by Dex may cause release from the suppression of osteoclastogenesis, thus resulting in an increase in osteoclast number, as is observed in the early phase of GC-induced bone loss.

(Tochigi, Japan), respectively. Recombinant human TGF-β1 and recombinant mouse IFN-β were obtained from Genzyme/Techne (Cambridge, MA) and PBL Biomedical Laboratories (New Brunswick, NJ), respectively. Recombinant GST-conjugated c-Jun was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA).

Osteoclastogenesis from M/MØ-like Hemopoietic Cells—Femora and tibiae were obtained from 4–5-week-old ICR mice (Shizuoka Laboratories Animal Center, Shizuoka, Japan), and the connective soft tissues were removed from the bones. Bone marrow cells were flushed out from the bone marrow cavity, suspended in α-MEM (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) supplemented with 10% FBS (Intergen, Purchase, NY), M-CSF (100 ng/ml), and 100 units/ml of penicillin, and cultured in Petri dishes in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. During 3 days in culture, the cells remaining on the bottom of the dishes consisted of a large population of adherent M/MØ-like cells, expressing MØ-specific antigens such as Mac-1 and F4/80 and exhibiting phagocytotic activity (11Kaneda T.

After removal of these nonadherent cells and stromal cells by washing the dishes with PBS and by subsequent incubation for 5 min in 0.25% trypsin/0.05% EDTA, respectively, the M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells were harvested in α-MEM/10% FBS by vigorous pipetting. The isolated M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells were seeded at an initial density of 2.5×104/cm2 and cultured in α-MEM/10% FBS/M-CSF (20 ng/ml) with or without sRANKL (40 ng/ml) and/or other cytokines or agents. The culture medium was exchanged for fresh medium every 2 days. After a culture period of the desired length, the cells were fixed in 10% formalin and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity with a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (Sigma). The number of TRAP-positive multinucleate cells (MNCs) with more than three nuclei, which were considered to be osteoclastic cells, was counted under a microscope. Quantification of TRAP by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Cellular TRAP activity was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy as described by Gallwitz et al. (43Gallwitz W.E. Mundy G.R. Lee C.H. Qiao M. Roodman G.D. Raftery M. Gaskell S.J. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10087-10094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Isolated M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells were pre-cultured in α-MEM/10% FBS/M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and/or other cytokines or agents for 2 days and then further cultured in the presence of sRANKL (40 ng/ml) under various conditions for 4 days. After the culture period, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed by two cycles of freezing and thawing in 0.05% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for determination of TRAP activity. The cell lysate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture consisting of 0.48 m sodium acetate/0.48 m acetic acid (pH 5.0), 20 mm tartaric acid, and 2 mm methylumbelliferyl phosphate as a substrate and then the reaction was terminated by adding glycine and EDTA (pH 10.5), each for a final concentration of 50 mm. The concentration of methylumbelliferone produced in the reaction mixture was determined by fluorometry with excitation at 366 nm and emission at 456 nm. Enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles of methylumbelliferyl phosphate hydrolyzed/min/mg protein. The concentration of proteins in the cell lysate was measured with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.). RT-PCR—Total RNA (1 μg) extracted from cultured cells was used as a template for cDNA synthesis. cDNA was prepared by use of a Superscript II preamplification system (Invitrogen). Primers were synthesized on the basis of the reported mouse cDNA sequences for TRAP, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, integrin αv, integrin β3, CD14, GR, RANK, TRAF2, TRAF6, c-fos, fra-1, c-jun, IFN-β, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), SOCS-3, STAT-1, STAT-2, ISGF-3γ, and β-actin. Sequences of the primers used for PCR were as follows: TRAP forward, 5′-CACGATGCCAGCGACAAGAG-3′; TRAP reverse, 5′-TGACCCCGTATGTGGCTAAC-3′; cathepsin K forward, 5′-GGAAGAAGACTCACCAGAAGC-3′; cathepsin K reverse, 5′-GTCATATAGCCGCCTCCACAG-3′; calcitonin receptor forward, 5′-ACCGACGAGCAACGCCTACGC-3′; calcitonin receptor reverse, 5′-GCCTTCACAGCCTTCAGGTAC-3′; integrin αv forward, 5′-GCCAGCCCATTGAGTTTGATT-3′; integrin αv reverse, 5′-GCTACCAGGACCACCGAGAAG-3′; integrin β3 forward, 5′-TTACCCCGTGGACATCTACTA-3′; integrin β3 reverse, 5′-AGTCTTCCATCCAGGGCAATA-3′; CD14 forward, 5′-AAGTTCCCGACCCTCCAAGTT-3′; CD14 reverse, 5′-CTGCCTTTCTTTCCTTACATC-3′; GR forward, 5′-CGCTCAGTGTTTTCTAATGG-3′; GR reverse, 5′-ATCAGGAGCAAAGCATAGCA-3′; RANK forward, 5′-CTCTGCGTGCTGCTCGTTCC-3′; RANK reverse, 5′-TTGTCCCCTGGTGTGCTTCT-3′; TRAF2 forward, 5′-CCGTGAAGTAGAGAGGGTAGC-3′; TRAF2 reverse, 5′-TTGGACACAGGGCAGAAGAGG-3′; TRAF6 forward, 5′-AGCCCACGAAAGCCAGAAGAA-3′; TRAF6 reverse, 5′-CCCTTATGGATTTGATGATGC-3′; c-fos forward, 5′-CATCGGCAGAAGGGGCAAAG-3′; c-fos reverse, 5′-GAGAAGGGGCAGGGTGAAGG-3′; fra-1 forward, 5′-AACCTTGCTCCTCCGCTCACC-3′; fra-1 reverse, 5′-GCTGCTGGCTGTTGATGCTGT-3′; c-jun forward, 5′-CTGGCGGCGGTGGTGGCTAC-3′; c-jun reverse, 5′-CGGTCTGCGGCTCTTCCTTC-3′; IFN-β forward, 5′-CTTCTCCACCACAGCCCTCTC-3′; IFN-β reverse, 5′-CCCACGTCAATCTTTCCTCTT-3′; SOCS-1 forward, 5′-AGGATGGTAGCACGCAACCAGGT-3′; SOCS-1 reverse, 5′-GATCTGGAAGGGGAAGGAACTCAGGTA-3′; SOCS-3 forward, 5′-GCCATGGTCACCCACAGCAAGTT-3′; SOCS-3 reverse, 5′-AAGTGGAGCATCATACTGATCCAGGA-3′; STAT-1 forward, 5′-CGAAGAGCGACCAAAAACAG-3′; STAT-1 reverse, 5′-TGCTGGAAGAGGAGGAAGGT-3′; STAT-2 forward, 5′-TTTGCTGGGACCTGTGCTCA-3′; STAT-2 reverse, 5′-TGGGTTCTCGGGGATGTTCT-3′; ISGF-3γ forward, 5′-GAACCCTCCCTAACCAACCA-3′; ISGF-3γ reverse, 5′-AGGTGAGCAGCAGCGAGTAG-3′; and β-actin forward, 5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTAC-3′; β-actin reverse, 5′-GAGTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAGC-3′. Amplification was conducted for 22–32 cycles, each of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 0.5 μl of each cDNA, 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After amplification, 15 μl of each reaction mixture was analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands were then visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Western Blot Analysis—After various treatments, the cells were washed with PBS, scraped into a solution consisting of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm p-aminoethyl-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (p-ABSF), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and sonicated for 15 s. The samples, containing equal amounts of protein, were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins separated in the gel were subsequently electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After having been blocked with 5% skim milk, the membrane was incubated with anti-GR, anti-NF-κB p50, anti-NF-κB p65, anti-phospho-NF-κB p65, anti-IκB-α, or anti-phospho-IκB-α antibodies and subsequently with peroxidase-conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with Western blot chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Assay of JNK Activity—M/MØ-like hemopoietic cells were pretreated or not with Dex and/or TGF-β in the presence of M-CSF for 2 days prior to treatment with RANKL for 1 h. After the treatment, the cells were extracted in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm p-ABSF. The cell lysis was then incubated with anti-JNK antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight and further incubated with protein A-beads for an additional 3 h. After several washes, the immunoreacted beads were suspended in a kinase reaction mixture (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi) and 1 μg of recombinant GST-c-Jun and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer, and the mixture was then boiled. After the samples had been subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% gel), the phosphorylated GST-c-Jun in the gel was visualized by autoradiography at –80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—After pretreatment or not with Dex and/or TGF-β in the presence of M-CSF for 2 days, the cells were treated with sRANKL for 1 h and then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 10 min on ice in 1 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm p-ABSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and scraped into the buffer. The cell lysates were incubated further for 10 min on ice and then transferred to tubes. The nuclei obtained by centrifugation for 1 min at 5000 × g were extracted by a 30-min incubation in ice-cold Buffer C, consisting of 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm p-ABSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Then, the extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used for EMSA. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing an NF-κB binding site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′), an AP-1 binding site (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGGAA-3′), or an IFN-stimulated response element (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′, element underlined (44Petricoin III, E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) were end-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction and combined and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μg of nuclear extract in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The specificity of the reaction was confirmed by competition with a 50-fold molar excess of nonlabeled oligonucleotides. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved by PAGE in 0.5× TBE buffer and visualized by autoradiography. In addition, other nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-NF-κB p50, anti-NF-κB p65, anti-c-Jun/AP-1, anti-c-Fos, anti-STAT-1, anti-STAT-2, or anti-ISFG-3γ antibodies for 30 min on ice after binding to the oligonucleotides and then were subjected to PAGE. Densitometry—Intensity of bands obtained from RT-PCR, JNK activity, and EMSA analyses was quantified by densitometry with an image analyzer (B. I. Systems Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Statistical Analysis—Means of groups were compared by analysis of variance, and significance of differences was determined by post-hoc testing using Bonferroni's method. Dexamethasone Stimulates Osteoclastogenesis from Bone Marrow M/MØ Cells—When bone marrow-derived M/MØ were incubated with M-CSF and sRANKL, and particularly when TGF-β was also present, most of the cells differentiated into cells of the osteoclast lineage and became mature osteoclasts, as described previously (11Kaneda T. Nojima T. Nakagawa M. Ogasawara A. Kaneko H. Sato T. Mano H. Kumegawa M. Hakeda Y. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4254-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous Dex increased the number of osteoclastic TRAP-positive MNCs formed in these cultures in the presence of TGF-β in a Dex dose-related manner, with the maximal increase at 10–9-10–8m (Fig. 1A); whereas the total number of nuclei was not changed (data not shown). However, at a higher concentration of 10–7m, Dex completely depressed the osteoclast formation. Thus, Dex revealed biphasic effects on osteoclastogenesis, one being stimulatory at lower concentrations (≤10–8m) and the o"
https://openalex.org/W2069141087,"E-cadherin germline missense mutations have been shown to be responsible for significant loss of protein activity. A new cytoplasmic E-cadherin germline missense mutation (V832 M) was recently identified in a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) Japanese family. This E-cadherin mutant was cloned in a Chinese hamster ovary cell model system and functionally characterized, in terms of aggregation and invasion. Cells expressing the germline V832M mutant fail to aggregate and invade into collagen, supporting the pathogenic role of this germline missense mutation in gastric cancer. We also tested the ability of this mutation to activate the TCF–LEF trascriptional activity, in comparison with three other E-cadherin missense mutations (T340A, A634V and A617T), associated to loss of E-cadherin function. All the E-cadherin mutants reduced TCF–LEF activation to a similar extent as the wild-type protein, suggesting that the oncogenic effect of the E-cadherin mutants is unlikely to be transmitted through a β-catenin-dependent activation of the WNT pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2086610822,"Mitochondria play a central role in apoptotic signaling pathways. Upon exposure to apoptotic stimuli, mitochondria release cytochrome c to the cytoplasm and activate caspase cascade leading to cell death. However, the events upstream of cytochrome c release are not fully understood. Here, we quantitate mitochondrial aggregation in situ using a novel laser scanning cytometry technique and reveal that mitochondria aggregate during apoptosis in a budding-like shape. The quantitative analysis reveals that mitochondrial aggregation is not inhibited by caspase-3 inhibitor ZEVD. Furthermore, bcl-x(L) transfection cannot suppress mitochondrial aggregation. However, overexpression of bcl-x(L) inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Therefore, mitochondrial aggregation is an event upstream of cytochrome c release during apoptosis. This mitochondrial aggregation was not observed in human leukemia H9 cells where apoptosis occurs in a mitochondria-independent fashion. Our studies imply that changes in the localization of mitochondria participate in the regulation of apoptosis through cytochrome c release."

https://openalex.org/W2010404096,"Appropriately timed proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis are essential to the normal functions of the mammary epithelium. Here, we report that the transcription factor BCL-6 is expressed in mammary epithelium in nonpregnant animals as well as during early pregnancy. When overexpressed in the nontransformed EpH4 mammary epithelial cell line, BCL-6 prevents the STAT-driven expression of the milk protein β-casein and duct formation, and prevents apoptosis. Consistent with an antiapoptotic function, we demonstrate that BCL-6 is expressed in 68% of histologically high-grade ductal breast carcinomas, which are clinically the most aggressive. BCL-6 has previously been characterized as a regulator of B lymphocyte growth and development, but our work identifies a novel role for it in mammary epithelial differentiation, which may also implicate it in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2133501797,"Globotriasosylceramide (Gb3), a neutral glycosphingolipid, is the B-cell differentiation antigen CD77 and acts as the receptor for most Shiga toxins, including verotoxin-1 (VT-1). We have shown that both anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and VT-1 induce apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We compared the apoptotic pathways induced by these two molecules by selecting cell lines sensitive to only one of these inducers or to both. In all these cell lines (including the apoptosis-resistant line), VT-1 was transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and inhibited protein synthesis similarly, suggesting that VT-1-induced apoptosis is dissociated from these processes. VT-1 triggered a caspase- and mitochondria-dependent pathway (rapid activation of caspases 8 and 3 associated with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria). In contrast, the anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced pathway was caspase-independent and only involved partial depolarization of mitochondria. Antioxidant compounds had only marginal effects on VT-1-induced apoptosis but strongly protected cells from anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced apoptosis. VT-1- and anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-treated cells displayed very different features on electron microscopy. These results clearly indicate that the binding of different ligands to Gb3/CD77 triggers completely different apoptotic pathways.

On erythrocytes, it constitutes the rare Pk blood group antigen (1Marcus D.M. Kundu S.K. Suzuki A. Sem. Hematol. 1981; 18: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). On lymphocytes, it constitutes the CD77 differentiation antigen and its expression is limited to a subset of germinal center B cells (2Mangeney M. Richard Y. Coulaud D. Tursz T. Wiels J. Eur. J.

Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 450-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of Gb3/CD77 has been extensively investigated. We previously reported that the ligation of Gb3/CD77 by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) induces apoptosis in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells, the tumoral counterparts of Gb3/CD77(+) germinal center B lymphocytes. We have also demonstrated that this apoptosis involves a rapid, sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a rapid, transient increase in cAMP levels, protein kinase A activation, and, finally, ceramide accumulation (5Mangeney M. Lingwood C.A. Taga S. Caillou B. Tursz T. Wiels J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5314-5319PubMed Google Scholar, 6Taga S. Carlier K. Mishal Z. Capoulade C. Mangeney M. Lécluse Y. Coulaud D. Tétaud C.

Because Gb3/CD77 is the Shiga toxin receptor, numerous studies have analyzed the role of these toxins and their receptor in pathogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 7Lingwood C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In humans, infection by Stx-producing organisms (some strains of Escherichia coli and Shigella dysenteriae type 1) causes gastrointestinal diseases and the more serious hemolytic uremic syndrome, both of which are responsible for large numbers of deaths (reviewed in Refs. 4Paton J.C.

Stx (also called verotoxins (VT) because the E. coli toxins were originally described to be cytotoxic to Vero cells (8O'Brien A.D. Tesh V.L. Donohue-Rolfe A. Jackson M.P. Olsnes S. Sandvig K. Lindberg A.A. Keusch G.T. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

The A subunit has RNA N-glycosidase activity; it removes an adenine base from 28 S RNA, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and killing target cells (9Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasawara T. Igarashi K. Eur J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have demonstrated that these toxins also induce apoptosis in various cell types. These studies have led to an ongoing controversy about the relationship between apoptosis and cell death due to protein synthesis inhibition (10Williams J.M. Lea N. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M.

Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1629-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the targeting of the toxin to a specific intracellular transport pathway can be determined by the Gb3/CD77 isoform expressed on the cell surface and by the presence or absence of Gb3/CD77 in the lipid raft microdomains of the membrane (16Arab S. Lingwood C.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 646-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Falguières T. Mallard F. Baron C. Hanau D. Lingwood C.A. Goud B. Salamero J. Johannes L. Mol. Biol.

Recent reports have shed light on both toxin- and anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced apoptotic pathways (6Taga S. Carlier K. Mishal Z. Capoulade C. Mangeney M. Lécluse Y. Coulaud D. Tétaud C. Pritchard L.L.

J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 128-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but various questions remain unresolved: Is ligand binding to Gb3/CD77 sufficient to induce apoptosis? Do ligands trigger a single intracellular mechanism? What is the relationship between protein synthesis inhibition and apoptosis for toxins? We investigated these issues by comparing the apoptotic mechanisms induced by anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and verotoxin-1 (VT-1) in various BL cells. Cellular toxicity was strictly dependent on the expression of Gb3/CD77 on the cell surface in both cases, but some cell lines strongly expressing Gb3/CD77 were killed by both inducers, whereas others were only killed by one. Our results indicate that these two ligands trigger different signaling pathways: VT-1-induced apoptosis involves caspase activation and mitochondrial depolarization, whereas oxidative stress seems to mediate anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced cell death. Finally, the ability of VT-1 to induce apoptosis was not correlated with the transport of this molecule to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or with the inhibition of protein synthesis. Cell Lines—All cell lines used in this study were originally established from endemic or sporadic cases of Burkitt's lymphoma. The Ramos BL cell line was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD), whereas the Namalwa and P3HR1 cells lines were kindly provided by Prof. G. Klein (Stockholm, Sweden) and the BL2 cells by Prof. G. Lenoir (Lyon, France). These cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, France) containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 20 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Gb3/CD77(–) Ramos cells were obtained after 10 days of culture in media containing 2 μm PPMP (1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol HCl), a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor causing reversible GSL depletion (20Abe A.

PPMP was obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Reagents—1A4 ascites (mouse monoclonal IgM anti-Gb3/CD77) was provided by Dr. S. Hakomori (Seattle, WA) (21Kojima H. Tsuchiya S. Sekiguchi K.

IgM were purified with the Immunopure IgM purification kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified recombinant verotoxin-1 (VT-1) was kindly provided by Dr. C. Lingwood (Toronto, Canada). The goat anti-human IgM (F(ab′)2 fragment) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA), the anti-cytochrome c mAb (clone 7H8.2C12) was from BD Pharmingen (Palo Alto, CA), the anti-PARP mAb (Ab-2, clone c-2-10) and the anti-caspase-8 mAb (Ab-3, clone 1-3) were from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). The goat anti-mouse IgM (GAM), used to cross-linked 1A4 mAb in apoptosis experiments, was obtained from Pierce. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (RAM), used for Western blotting, was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The FITC-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG plus IgM, used for FACS analysis, was from Caltag Laboratory (Burlingame, CA). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and GSH ethyl ester (GSH-EE), a cell-permeable form of reduced glutathione (GSH), were purchased from Sigma (L'isle d'Abeau Chesnes, France). The fluorescent dye 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6 (3)) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). A stock solution (1 mm in Me2SO) was stored at room temperature. The peptide inhibitor of caspase 8 (Z-IETD-FMK (fluoromethylketone)) was purchased from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). α4Gal-transferase Transfection—The full coding sequence of the Gb3/CD77 synthase α4Gal-T1 gene (22Steffensen R.

This construct was used to transfect Namalwa cells, which do not express Gb3/CD77. Briefly, 5 × 106 Namalwa cells were transfected with 20 μg of the pDR2 or α4Gal-T1pDR2 plasmids by electroporation with a double pulse of 800 V, 25 microfarads (μF), and 100 V, 1500 μF (Easy-cell ject+, Eurogentec, France). After 48 h, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 500 μg/ml hygromycin for selection. Cells were cultured for 4 weeks in this selection medium, and Gb3/CD77 antigen expression was evaluated in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To reduce heterogeneity in Gb3/CD77 expression on Namalwa cells transfected with the α4Gal-T1 gene, cells were relabeled with the anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and the subset of cells with high expression levels was sorted on a FACSort apparatus (BD Biosciences). The sorted cells were designated Nam/Gb3(+), and cells transfected with pDR2 were named NampDR2. Induction of Apoptosis and Cell Death Measurement—We incubated 5 × 105 cells with the anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (50 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgM (10 μg/ml) or with VT-1 (50 ng/ml) in 1 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium. After 24 h at 37 °C, cells were centrifuged, resuspended in annexin buffer (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing 2.5 μg/ml FITC-labeled annexin V (Euromedex, France) and incubated at 4 °C for 5 min. Cells were then washed and resuspended in annexin buffer supplemented with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) and analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Measurement of Protein Synthesis—We investigated the ability of VT-1 to inhibit protein synthesis by incubating cells for 24 h in medium containing 1 μCi/ml [3H]leucine, in the presence or absence of VT-1 (50 ng/ml) or cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) as a control for protein inhibition. Cells were harvested on glass fiber filters, and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard, Meriden, CT). Retrograde Transport and N-Glycosylation Analysis—Modified VT-B fragment (B-Glyc-KDEL) iodination and glycosylation analyses were carried out as previously described (23Johannes L. Tenza D. Antony C. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19554-19561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 125I-B-Glyc-KDEL (20 nm) for 30 min at 4 °C and washed three times with ice-cold medium. Cells were allowed to take up iodinated VT-B for 15 h at 37 °C and were then lysed in SDS sample buffer. In some experiments, cells were treated with tunicamycin (1 μg/ml) before incubation with 125I-B-Glyc-KDEL. Samples were run on 10–20% polyacrylamide-SDS gradient gels, analyzed by autoradiography, and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Saclay, France) using ImageQuant software. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—We incubated 5 × 105 cells with VT-1 or anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb for various periods of time. We then added carbocyanine dye, DIOC6 (3), to a concentration of 40 nm and incubated the cells for a further 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS and then analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Preparation of Mitochondrial and Cytosolic Fractions—We evaluated cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol by fractionating cells as previously described (24Waterhouse N.J. Goldstein J.C. von Ahsen O. Schuler M. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). We incubated 2 × 106 cells in 100 μl of ice-cold cell lysis and mitochondria intact (CLAMI) buffer (250 mm sucrose, 70 mm KCl, 200 μg/ml digitonin in PBS) for 5 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation (1,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min) and the supernatants, containing cytosolic proteins, were stored at –80 °C. Pellets were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants, containing mitochondrial proteins, were stored at –80 °C. Western Blot Analysis—For PARP and caspase-8 analysis, cell pellets were solubilized in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). Sample loading buffer was added, the mixture was boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were then separated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, before being transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore) by electroblotting (Trans-blot cell, Bio-Rad). For cytochrome c analysis, proteins from mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were separated by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Blots were blocked by incubation in 3% nonfat milk powder, 2% glycine in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary mAb (2 μg/ml) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated RAM-IgG. Antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system, Amersham Biosciences). Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed at room temperature by adding 1.6% glutaraldehyde to the culture medium and centrifuged. Pellets were then incubated in 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.066 m Sorensen buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed for 2 h in buffer and post-fixed in 2% OsO4 in the same buffer. They were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions and propylene oxide, before being embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections, prepared with an ultramicrotome (Leica ultracut UCT, Leica Microsystems, Austria), were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation on a Zeiss 902 microscope (Leo Electron microscopy, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Gb3/CD77(+) BL Cells Display Differential Sensitivity to Apoptosis Induced by Cross-linked Anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and VT-1—We investigated the mechanism of Gb3/CD77-mediated apoptosis by treating a series of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines with VT-1 or an anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (clone 1A4) cross-linked with a goat anti-mouse antibody (GAM). We selected cell lines that were spontaneously Gb3/CD77(+) (Ramos, P3HR1, BL2) or Gb3/CD77(–) (Namalwa), and we also generated Gb3/CD77(–) cells from cells that were originally positive and Gb3/CD77(+) cells from cells that were originally negative. Gb3/CD77(–) converted Ramos cells were established by treatment with PPMP, a glycolipid biosynthesis inhibitor, and are referred to as Ramos PPMP. Gb3/CD77(+) converted Namalwa cells were obtained by stable transfection with the Gb3/CD77 synthase cDNA (α4Gal-T1) (22Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Sojka B.N. Bennett E.P. Jersild C. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16723-16729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and are referred to as Nam/Gb3(+). Cell surface expression of Gb3/CD77 was evaluated by FACS analysis, using an anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (clone 1A4). Ramos, P3HR1, BL2, and Nam/Gb3(+) cells strongly expressed Gb3/CD77 (mean fluorescence index (MFI): 228, 214, 165, and 168, respectively) (Fig. 1). The Namalwa cells transfected with the insert-less vector (NampDR2) did not express Gb3/CD77 (MFI: 14), and treatment with PPMP greatly decreased expression of this antigen (MFI: 33) (Fig. 1). We then assessed the sensitivity of these cell lines to VT-1 and to an anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (Table I). VT-1 and anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb had different effects: apoptosis levels were high in Ramos, BL2, and P3HR1 cells treated with anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (74 ± 13%, 71 ± 11%, and 89 ± 5%, respectively), whereas Nam/Gb3(+) cells responded only weakly to this treatment (28 ± 4%). In contrast, VT-1 strongly induced apoptosis in Ramos, BL2, and Nam/Gb3(+) cells (98 ± 1%, 96 ± 4%, and 66 ± 7%, respectively), whereas it had almost no effect on P3HR1 cells (11 ± 3%). We investigated whether the resistance of P3HR1 to VT-1-induced apoptosis was dose-dependent by treating these cells with 500 ng/ml and 5 μg/ml VT-1. No apoptosis was observed at either concentration (data not shown). Gb3/CD77(–) NampDR2 and Ramos PPMP cells were not killed by anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb or VT-1 (Table I).Table IInduction of apoptosis in various BL cells by ligation of Gb3/CD77Cell lineApoptotic cellsGAMAnti-Gb3MediumVT-1%CD77(+)Ramos9 ± 274 ± 1310 ± 398 ± 1BL29 ± 371 ± 119 ± 296 ± 4P3HR17 ± 289 ± 56 ± 111 ± 3Nam/Gb3(+)6 ± 228 ± 47 ± 166 ± 7CD77(-)Ramos PPMP6 ± 18 ± 16 ± 113 ± 5NampDR25 ± 16 ± 26 ± 25 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Two of the Gb3/CD77(+) BL cell lines tested (Ramos and BL2) were therefore sensitive to both anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and VT-1; one cell line (P3HR1) was sensitive to anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb only, and one (Nam/Gb3(+)) was mostly sensitive to VT-1. Thus, the induction of apoptosis by anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb and VT-1 is strictly dependent on cell-surface Gb3/CD77 expression, but this expression is not sufficient to confer sensitivity to these apoptosis inducers. Retrograde Transport of the VT-B Subunit Is Similar in All Gb3/CD77(+) BL Cells—To determine why P3HR1 cells do not undergo apoptosis when treated by VT-1, we investigated the pathway by which verotoxin is taken up by BL cell lines. The retrograde transport of VT to the ER has been shown to be necessary for maximal toxicity (25Sandvig K. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated the uptake of VT into the ER, using a previously described modified VT-B subunit (B-glyc-KDEL) (23Johannes L. Tenza D. Antony C. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19554-19561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). B-glyc-KDEL carries an N-glycosylation site at the C terminus of the VT-B fragment, making it possible to detect its arrival in the ER by monitoring glycosylation by the ER-located oligosaccharyltransferase. After iodinated B-glyc-KDEL had been taken up (at 37 °C for 15 h), we lysed the cells (Ramos, P3HR1, Nam/Gb3(+), NampDR2, and HeLa (used as a positive control)) and analyzed the lysates by high resolution gradient gel (10–20%) electrophoresis and autoradiography. In addition to B-Glyc-KDEL, a band with a lower electrophoretic mobility was detected in HeLa, Ramos, P3HR1, and Nam/Gb3(+) extracts. No such band was detected in Gb3/CD77(–) NampDR2 extracts, in which B-Glyc-KDEL had not been internalized (Fig. 2). Treatment of the cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, totally abolished this band. Thus, this band corresponds to glycosylated B-Glyc-KDEL. This glycosylated product was quantified with a PhosphorImager: 21.8% of the total B-fragment was glycosylated in the control HeLa cells, 8.6% in Ramos, 10.8% in P3HR1, and 7.7% in Nam/Gb3(+). Because P3HR1 cells are resistant to VT-1-induced apoptosis, these observations suggest that the retrograde transport of the toxin to the ER is insufficient to trigger apoptosis. VT-1 Inhibited Protein Synthesis Similarly in All Gb3/CD77(+) BL Cells—The cytotoxicity of VT-1 is generally considered to be mediated by the inhibition of protein synthesis (9Endo Y. Tsurugi K. Yutsudo T. Takeda Y. Ogasawara T. Igarashi K. Eur J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed protein synthesis in the various cell lines (Ramos, P3HR1, Nam/Gb3(+), and NampDR2) treated for 24 h with VT-1, by measuring [3H]leucine uptake. As a control, cells were also treated with cycloheximide, a general protein synthesis inhibitor. Protein synthesis was totally inhibited in Ramos and P3HR1 cells treated with VT-1 (0.6% and 1% of the [3H]leucine uptake of untreated cells, respectively) and almost totally inhibited in Nam/Gb3(+) cells (8.5% of the [3H]leucine uptake of control cells). No effect was observed in the Gb3/CD77(–) NampDR2 cell line (101% of [3H]leucine uptake) (Table II). Cycloheximide completely inhibited protein synthesis in all four BL cell lines. The results obtained with P3HR1 cells indicate that the apoptotic and protein synthesis-inhibiting effects of VT-1 can be dissociated.Table IIAnalysis of protein synthesis after treatment with VT-1Cell line[3H]Leucine uptake (% of control)ControlVT-1CycloheximideRamos103,623 ± 8,161589 ± 105 (0.6%)479 ± 63 (0.5%)P3HR196,204 ± 9,840989 ± 242 (1%)1,979 ± 275 (2%)Nam/Gb3(+)82,794 ± 15,5057,039 ± 785 (8.5%)1,568 ± 206 (1,9%)NampDR289,849 ± 11,86390,506 ± 9,796 (101%)1,357 ± 299 (1.5%) Open table in a new tab VT-1 Induces Caspase Activation, whereas Cross-linked Anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb Does Not—We investigated the involvement of caspases in the apoptotic pathways induced by VT-1 and anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb. Caspase-8 is an initiator caspase involved in a variety of apoptotic pathways. We investigated its activation in our BL cells. Ramos, P3HR1, Nam/Gb3(+), and NampDR2 cells were treated with VT-1 or anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb for various periods of time (2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 h), and caspase-8 activation was assessed by Western blotting with a mAb that strongly recognized the zymogen form (54/55 kDa) and the intermediate form (41/43 kDa) and only weakly recognized the 18-kDa active subunit. Levels of the 41/43-kDa intermediate gradually increased in extracts of Ramos cells treated with VT-1 for 2–16 h, whereas levels of the zymogen decreased (Fig. 3); in P3HR1 cells, VT-1 did not induce caspase-8 cleavage, whereas in Nam/Gb3(+) cells, the 41/43-kDa intermediate form appeared after 4 h of treatment and gradually accumulated until 16 h. No caspase-8 cleavage was observed in the three cell lines treated with anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (see Fig. 3) or in Gb3/CD77(–) NampDR2 cells treated with VT-1 or anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb (data not shown). Caspase-8 cleaves and activates caspase-3. Thus, we investigated the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), a DNA repair enzyme directly targeted by caspase-3. In Ramos cells, the 85-kDa PARP proteolytic product was detected on Western blots after2hof treatment with VT-1 and increased in amount until 8 h of treatment, when native PARP protein was no longer detected (Fig. 4). In P3HR1 cells, a small amount of the 85-kDa cleavage product was detected only after 16 h of treatment with VT-1. In Nam/Gb3(+) cells, the 85-kDa band was first detected after 4 h of treatment and increased in intensity until 16 h. However, unlike in Ramos cells, the native form was never totally cleaved in these cells. Treatment of these three cell lines with anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb did not induce cleavage of the PARP protein. Treatment of NampDR2 cells with VT-1 or anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb did not result in PARP cleavage (data not shown). Thus, caspases are involved in the apoptotic pathway induced by VT-1, whereas the mechanism of anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb-induced apoptosis seems to be caspase-independent. VT-1 and Cross-linked Anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb Induce a Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential in Different Ways—Mitochondria are a key element in many apoptotic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 26Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar). We therefore measured mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) before and after treatment of the cells with VT-1 or anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb. We measured Δψm by cytofluorimetry, using the carbocyanine dye DiOC6(3). In Ramos cells, VT-1 induced a loss of Δψm after 4 h of treatment, which gradually increased until 16 h, when mitochondrial membrane depolarization was observed in all cells (Fig. 5A). In Nam/Gb3(+) cells, the loss of Δψm was delayed, and only 18% of cells were DIOC6(3)low after 8 h of treatment. However, Δψm loss then rapidly increased and 66% of cells were DIOC6(3)low after 24 h of treatment. No Δψm loss was observed in P3HR1 and NampDR2 cells. We investigated whether caspase-8 activation occurred upstream or downstream from mitochondrial perturbation by studying the effects of a caspase-8-specific inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) on Δψm loss. Preincubation of the cells with this tetrapeptide inhibited the loss of Δψm induced by VT-1 (after 24 h, 69% of pre-treated Ramos cells were DIOC6(3)low versus 100% of cells that had not been pre-treated, and 48% of pretreated Nam/Gb3(+) cells were DIOC6(3)low versus 66% of non-pretreated cells) (Fig. 5A). Thus, mitochondrial depolarization appears to depend, at least partly, on caspase-8 activation. We also treated the BL cell lines for the same length of time with anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb. Anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb induced a moderate, sustained loss of Δψm in P3HR1 cells (∼30% of the cells were DIOC6(3)low following 4–24 h of treatment) but had no effect on Δψm in Ramos cells (although these cells are as sensitive as P3HR1 to anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb) or on Δψm in Nam/Gb3(+) and NampDR2 cells (Fig. 5B). VT-1 and Cross-linked Anti-Gb3/CD77 mAb Induce Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria in Different Ways—During apoptosis, Δψm disruption is generally accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from the m"
https://openalex.org/W1995038616,"Two cases of atypical chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) carrying the t(4;22)(q12;q11) translocation involving the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and platelet-derived growth factor alpha receptor (PDGFRA) genes have been recently characterized. We report a third case of atypical CML with the same translocation but with a distinct breakpoint fusing BCR exon 1 with PDGFRA exon 13. The patient had a clinical presentation of CML with progressive transformation in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The involvement of PDGFRA led us to treat the patient with the small organic compound imatinib mesylate/STI571 (Glivec) that blocks the ATP binding site of tyrosine kinases such as Abelson, KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The patient subsequently achieved a rapid clinical and molecular response clearly demonstrating, for the first time, that Glivec is active against PDGFRA in vivo. Therefore, our study expands the list of Glivec targets and has direct biological and also clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2024111498,"Catalase-peroxidases (KatG), which belong to Class I heme peroxidase enzymes, have high catalase activity and substantial peroxidase activity. The Y229F mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG was prepared and characterized to investigate the functional role of this conserved residue unique to KatG enzymes. Purified, overexpressed KatG[Y229F] exhibited severely reduced steady-state catalase activity while the peroxidase activity was enhanced. Optical stopped-flow experiments showed rapid formation of Compound (Cmpd) II (oxyferryl heme intermediate) in the reaction of resting KatG[Y229F] with peroxyacetic acid or chloroperoxybenzoic acid, without detectable accumulation of Cmpd I (oxyferryl heme π-cation radical intermediate), the latter being readily observed in the wild-type enzyme under similar conditions. Facile formation of Cmpd III (oxyferrous enzyme) also occurred in the mutant in the presence of micromolar hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the lost catalase function may be explained in part because of formation of intermediates that do not participate in catalatic turnover. The source of the reducing equivalent required for generation of Cmpd II from Cmpd I was shown by rapid freeze-quench electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to be a tyrosine residue, just as in wild-type KatG. The kinetic coupling of radical generation and Cmpd II formation was shown in KatG[Y229F]. Residue Y229, which is a component of a newly defined three amino acid adduct in catalase-peroxidases, is critically important for protecting the catalase activity of KatG.

Mauro J.M. Norskov-Lauritsen L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of special interest in the field of tuberculosis research because of its role in the activation of the important antibiotic isoniazid and in the origins of resistance to this drug because of mutations in KatG. KatGs have high homology to yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), including conserved distal arginine, tryptophan, and histidine residues and conserved proximal histidine and its hydrogen bonding partner, asparagine (2Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because these conserved residues are of key importance in governing catalytic mechanisms, strong functional homology would be expected among the Class I enzymes. Nevertheless, catalase activity is absent from CcP and ascorbate peroxidase but is very robust in KatGs. The origin of the high catalase activity of KatGs must, therefore, reside in features of these enzymes beyond the conservation of the key active site residues. Mutation of the conserved tryptophan residue gave rise to mutant Escherichia coli and Synechocystis enzymes with poor catalase function (3Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G.

The origin of this change was assigned to altered binding of the second molecule of hydrogen peroxide required for reduction of compound (Cmpd) I in the catalase cycle. Other mutations have also been shown to interfere with catalytic activity (6Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Regelsberger G. Jantschko W. Furtmuller P.G. Ruker F. Obinger C. Eur. J.

With the first reports of the three-dimensional x-ray crystal structures of two bacterial catalase-peroxidases came the discovery of an unusual three-amino acid adduct involving covalently linked distal side tryptophan, tyrosine, and methionine residues (11Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Carpena X. Loprasert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The presence of this adduct, then, may be the key feature that distinguishes KatGs from their homologues (Fig. 1). Mutation of the tyrosine residue in the amino acid adduct was reported to completely eliminate Synechocystis KatG catalase activity (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, clues that the adduct plays a unique functional role in KatGs were emerging, and an interesting challenge to explain its special role in catalytic mechanisms was presented. Replacement of the redox active tyrosine with phenylalanine would prevent formation of the adduct in M. tuberculosis KatG. Any resulting changes in mechanism in this mutant could be probed by us in both optical stopped-flow and rapid freeze-quench EPR experiments to gain insights into mechanistic details absent from current literature on catalase-peroxidases. Previous studies (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) of M. tuberculosis KatG have shown that Cmpd I, the classical oxyferryl iron-protoporphyrin IX/π-cation radical species, is formed and is significantly less stable than the Cmpd I formed in plant peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase. Cmpd II could not be detected, but Cmpd III (oxyperoxidase) is formed when KatG reacts with a large excess of H2O2. Similar results are reported for other KatGs (3Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Furtmuller P.G. Rueker F. Switala J. Loewen P.C.

The formation of Cmpd III in the presence of H2O2 indicates that KatG enzymes must cycle through Cmpd II, because the expected pathway to oxyferrous enzyme is through an initial single-electron reaction of Cmpd II with hydrogen peroxide (15Nakajima R. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2576-2581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of Cmpd II from Cmpd I in M. tuberculosis KatG involves an electron transfer-producing tyrosyl radical (16Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol.

Here, we report the preparation of KatG[Y229F] by site-directed mutagenesis and upon the characterization of the recombinant protein. KatG[Y229F] exhibited defective catalase but increased peroxidase activity compared with WT KatG, among other changes in structure and function. Rapid formation of Cmpd II and a tyrosyl radical, which disrupts catalase but not peroxidase function, is also shown. Chemicals and Reagents—All standard chemicals and reagents, including Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, were purchased from Fisher. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) (Sigma) was recrystallized from methanol before use. PAA (Sigma) (32%) was diluted to 10 mm in potassium phosphate buffer and incubated with 780 units/ml catalase (Roche Applied Science) for 4 h at 37 °C to remove hydrogen peroxide, followed by removal of the enzyme by ultrafiltration. Restriction nucleases, polynucleotide kinase, DNA ligase, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. Construction, Expression, and Purification of the Y229F Mutant of KatG—The plasmid pKAT II was used as an overexpression vector for KatG (17Johnsson K. Froland W.A. Schultz P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and as the source for mutagenesis. XL1-Blue (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 relA1 lac (F′ proAB lacI q ZΔM15 Tn10 (Tetr))) (Stratagene) was used in the mutagenesis steps. E. coli strain UM262 (recA katG::Tn10 pro leu rpsL hsdM hsdR endl lacY) (18Loewen P.C. Stauffer G.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) was used for overexpression of both wild-type and mutated KatG proteins. UM262 and pKAT II were both gifts from Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris). Mutagenesis was performed by using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). This method allows direct mutagenesis of KatG in the expression vector without subcloning in an intermediate vector. The pairs of complementary oligonucleotides (synthesized and purified by Qiagen) were designed to introduce the required mutation. The oligonucleotide pairs were 5′-672GATGGGGCTGATCTTCGTGAACCCGGAGG700-3′ and 5′-700CCTCCGGGTTCACGAAGATCAGCCCCATC672-3′ for KatG[Y229F] (a → t mutation, mutated codons are in bold). Mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the reaction products were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain. Sequencing of the mutated katG gene confirmed that only the desired nucleotide substitution occurred (Gene Wiz, Inc.), and the mutated plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain UM262 for protein expression. Overexpression of recombinant WT KatG and mutant KatG[Y229F] enzymes and their purification was achieved (as described previously, Ref. 9Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The pure enzymes had optical purity ratios (A 407/A 280) greater than or equal to 0.5. SDS gel electrophoresis was carried out under denaturing (SDS-PAGE) and non-denaturing (native PAGE) conditions using an Amersham Biosciences PhastGel system. Enzyme Assays—Protein concentration, expressed as heme concentration, was determined by using a heme extinction coefficient at 407 nm equal to 100 mm–1 cm–1 (19Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Catalase and peroxidase activities were determined spectrophotometrically in replicate analyses using initial rates of reactions with hydrogen peroxide or t-butyl hydroperoxide plus o-dianisidine (peroxidase activity) (19Marcinkeviciene J.A. Magliozzo R.S. Blanchard J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22290-22295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Saint-Joanis B. Souchon H. Wilming M. Johnsson K. Alzari P.M. Cole S.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on an NT14 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Stopped-flow Optical Measurements—A rapid scanning diode array stopped-flow apparatus (HiTech Scientific Model SF-61DX2) was used for single- and double-mixing kinetics experiments. Data acquisition and analyses were performed using the Kinet-Asyst software package (HiTech Scientific). The formation and decomposition of Compounds I, II, and III were followed at 25 °C in reactions of resting WT KatG and KatG[Y229F] with freshly prepared solutions of PAA, CPBA, or H2O2, all in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Double-mixing stopped-flow experiments were performed to follow the reaction of Cmpd II with H2O2 or reducing substrates, as described previously (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy—Rapid freeze-quench EPR samples were prepared as described previously (16Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) using an Update Instrument, Inc. Model 1000 chemical-freeze-quench apparatus. WT KatG or KatG[Y229F] (typically 100 μm heme) and peroxyacetic acid (300 μm) were mixed and aged for the indicated time periods (all in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2), followed by freeze-quenching of reaction mixtures in isopentane at –130 °C. Frozen sample powders were packed into precision bore quartz EPR tubes immersed in an isopentane bath and examined with a Varian EPR spectrometer operating at X-band. A finger Dewar inserted into the EPR cavity was used for recording spectra at 77 K. A liquid helium cryostat and Heli-Tran liquid helium transfer system (Advanced Research Systems, Inc., Allentown, PA) were used for EPR at 6–10 K. EPR data acquisition and manipulation were performed as described previously (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cu(II)EDTA in 50% ethylene glycol was used as a standard for spin quantification by double integration of EPR signal intensities. The signal to noise ratio in EPR spectra was improved by signal averaging when necessary. The estimation of spin concentration in freeze-quench samples included application of a packing factor of 0.5 to account for sample dilution by isopentane. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The binding of INH to KatG[Y229F] was evaluated by using a MicroCal isothermal titration calorimetry apparatus, as described previously (10Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Characterization of Purified KatG[Y229F]—The WT KatG and KatG[Y229F] mutant enzymes were produced in E. coli using a previously described overexpression system carrying the wild-type M. tuberculosis katG gene or the mutated gene (9Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Purified mutant enzyme was indistinguishable from WT KatG on SDS-PAGE and in native polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (data not shown). The optical purity ratio, A 407/A 280, of purified KatG[Y229F] was ≥0.50, similar to WT KatG. The optical spectrum of resting KatG[Y229F] contained shallow features near 540 and 580 nm, which is characteristic of either six-coordinate low spin ferric heme or oxyferrous enzyme, neither of which is evident in the spectrum of WT KatG. The small red shift of the Soret peak (408 nm versus 405 nm in the freshly isolated WT enzyme) (16Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is also consistent with a small contribution from low spin heme species (data not shown). Low temperature EPR spectra of KatG[Y229F] were recorded to gain additional insight into heme structural features in this mutant. The freshly purified mutant enzyme has an EPR spectrum dominated by a rhombic signal with g values of 6.0 and 5.6 (Fig. 2, top spectrum) previously assigned in WT KatG to a six-coordinate heme species (16Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the EPR spectrum of the WT enzyme is dominated by a broader rhombic signal (g1 = 6.3; g2 = 5.14; g3 ∼ 2.0) previously assigned to the major, five-coordinate heme species (Fig. 2, bottom spectrum). A small amount of a second rhombic signal (g1 = 6.6; g2 = 5.2; g3 ∼ 2.0) was observed in both WT and mutant enzymes. For both enzymes, an evolution toward an axial signal characteristic of six-coordinate high spin heme iron occurred when the enzyme was examined after storage for a few weeks (data not shown), but this phenomenon is not explored further here (16Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The spectrum of freshly purified KatG[Y229F] was also recorded under conditions useful for observation of rhombic low spin heme iron signals (microwave power = 0.1 mW, temperature = 10 K). Under these conditions, no signal characteristic of low spin heme iron was found. 2An artifactual signal caused by Cu(II) (g∥ = 2.3, g⊥ = 2.1) was occasionally seen under such conditions for the mutant enzyme and for WT KatG. This result suggests that the origin of the α and β bands detected in the optical spectrum of KatG[Y229F] is oxyferrous enzyme (Cmpd III; see below), which is non-paramagnetic. Compared with WT KatG, the catalase activity of KatG[Y229F] was reduced by 1400-fold (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 3800 ± 300 units/mg) under assay conditions using millimolar concentrations of H2O2, whereas its peroxidase activity was 3-fold greater than that of WT KatG (2.8 ± 0.4 versus 0.9 ± 0.1 units/mg). The k cat/Km value for the catalase reaction was reduced from 1 × 106 in WT KatG to 4 × 102 in KatG[Y229F]. Specific mechanistic insights were provided by the stoppedflow kinetic analyses presented below. Stopped-flow optical experiments were used to examine the formation of intermediates and to provide insights into the alterations observed in the steady-state measurements. In these experiments, resting enzyme was mixed with peroxides, and the reaction was followed by monitoring changes in the optical spectrum. Values for k obs were determined by fitting hyperbolic exponential functions to changes in absorbance at a particular wavelength either in the Soret region or at a maximum absorbance in the visible region. For WT KatG, we previously reported the second-order rate constants for Cmpd I formation based on the observed rates using varying concentrations of CPBA (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or PAA (9Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rate constants were in the range of 104m–1 s–1 for M. tuberculosis WT KatG and two mutants associated with resistance to the antibiotic INH (9Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Yu S. Girotto S. Lee C. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14769-14775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In WT KatG, the decay of Cmpd I and the return of the enzyme to the resting state were seen without other intermediates detected (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For KatG[Y229F], rapid turnover of Cmpd I to Cmpd II and/or Cmpd III was observed. 3We initially used commercially available PAA, which contains 6% H2O2, for the stopped-flow experiments and only observed Cmpd III. Bovine liver catalase was then used to eliminate the H2O2, enabling the observation of Cmpd II formation in KatG[Y229F]. For WT KatG, the level of H2O2 in commercial PAA is insufficient to produce Cmpd III (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Fig. 3 shows an example of the spectral changes for KatG[Y229F] (10 μm) reacted with PAA (30 μm). The initial spectrum is that of resting enzyme; the intermediate spectrum is characterized by the expected decrease in intensity of the Soret peak consistent with generation of Cmpd I (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The final spectrum is characterized by a red-shifted Soret peak (416 nm) and the appearance of features near 530 and 560 nm; the CT1 band (near 640 nm) characteristic of the resting enzyme is nearly abolished. The features in the final spectrum are common to those found in horseradish peroxidase Cmpd II or CcP Cmpd I, both of which contain oxyferryl heme but not the porphyrin-π-cation radical (21Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York, NY1999: 140-225Google Scholar). Examination of the time courses at 409 nm or 416 nm allowed for evaluation of k obs for formation of Cmpd I and Cmpd II, respectively. Values of k obs for formation of Cmpd I were linearly dependent on the concentration of PAA (3- to 10-fold excess over heme concentration). The second-order rate constant for Cmpd I formation was estimated to be 4 × 106–1 s–1, which is 330-fold more rapid than the rate for WT KatG (1.21 × 104m–1 s–1) (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) but very similar to the rate reported for Synechocystis KatG[Y249F] (8.0 × 106m–1 s–1) m (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rate of Cmpd I formation was also evaluated using CPBA from pH 5.5 to 8.8. For WT KatG, a 3-fold decrease in the second-order rate constant with increasing pH was observed (5.6 × 104 versus 2.1 × 104m–1 s–1); for KatG[Y229F], the decrease was more dramatic (6-fold) in the same pH range (5.6 × 106 versus 1.0 × 106m–1 s–1). Whether the steeper dependence is associated with a specific change in the contribution of a distal residue to Cmpd I formation remains to be proven. After Cmpd I formation, the rate of appearance of the features characteristic of Cmpd II was only slightly increased, going from 3-fold to 10-fold excess of PAA concentration (k obs = 12.7–14.2 ± 0.5 s–1). The spectral features of Cmpd II persisted for at least 6 min (see below) under these conditions. The spontaneous and rapid evolution of Cmpd I to Cmpd II contrasts with the behavior of the WT enzyme, in which Cmpd II is not seen (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and is different from the behavior of Synechocystis KatG[Y249F], in which the endogenous conversion to Cmpd II was 23-fold slower (k obs = 0.6 ± 0.1 s–1) (13Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Ruker F. Furtmuller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When CPBA was used to generate Cmpd I, formation of Cmpd II also was observed, but it decayed within 5 s, unlike the results with PAA (data not shown). These results are consistent with CPBA serving not only to generate Cmpd I, but also as a single electron-reducing substrate for Cmpd II. Single electron processes have been reported previously in reactions of CPBA with horseradish peroxidase (22Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Hernandez-Ruiz J. Garcia-Canovas F. Thorneley R.N. Acosta M. Arnao M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5469-5476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) but have not been explicitly shown for WT KatG. We show below that Cmpd II in KatG[Y229F] is also reduced in the presence of other substrates, such as ascorbate or INH. To focus on issues relating to the poor catalase activity of KatG[Y229F], stopped-flow experiments were conducted using H2O2. When resting enzyme was mixed with one or two stoichiometric equivalents of H2O2, the features of Cmpd II were again detected (data not shown), demonstrating a similar reaction pathway to that found using PAA. With higher peroxide concentrations (100–1000 μm H2O2), Cmpd III rapidly developed (Fig. 4A). These features, which include a decreased and red-shifted Soret peak (416 nm) and shoulders at 543 and 580 nm, are closely related to those of horseradish peroxidase Cmpd III and other oxyperoxidases (14Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 23Goodwin D.C. Grover T.A. Aust S.D.

Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1970-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the formation of Cmpd III was the result of reaction of H2O2 with Cmpd II, a double-mixing protocol was used. Here, KatG[Y229F]-Cmpd II was allowed to form in the first mixing phase (resting enzyme plus PAA incubated for 1 s), followed by the addition of H2O2 (Fig. 4B). Optical features consistent with the formation of Cmpd III again appeared. The catalytic competence of Cmpd II in the mutant enzyme was demonstrated using ascorbate or INH as reducing substrates. Addition of ascorbate or INH in a double-mixing experiment after the generation of Cmpd II in the first mixing phase caused the loss of Cmpd II (Fig. 5, A and B) (ascorbate, 20:1, and INH, 100:1, over heme concentration). These results are taken as evidence for the catalytic competence of Cmpd II in a reaction that could not be observed in WT KatG. The reaction of INH with Cmpd I in WT and mutant KatGs was shown previously (9Yu S. Chouchane S. Magliozzo R.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Yu S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, the antibiotic serves as a reducing substrate for both peroxidase intermediates in KatG, and the activation of this pro-drug through the peroxidase pathway in M. tuberculosis KatG is substantiated. The mechanisms for such activation have often invoked reaction paths different from the classical peroxidase cycle (26Wengenack N.L. Hoard H.M. Rusnak F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9748-9749Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Magliozzo R.S. Marcinkeviciene J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11303-11304Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Magliozzo R.S.

Rapid Freeze-quench EPR—In WT KatG, the kinetics and stoichiometry of tyrosyl radical formation was studied using rapid freeze-quench-EPR spectroscopy (16Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Quenching of this radical by small reducing molecules including INH was also shown. The evolution of the initially formed radical from a structure that exhibited a doublet EPR signal to one that exhibited a singlet was also described. Kinetic evidence suggested forma"
https://openalex.org/W2061425678,"Two homologs of the tumor suppressor p53, named p63 and p73, are each expressed from at least two start sites of mRNA synthesis, yielding full-length, transactivating (TA) isoforms, and also aminoterminally truncated (ΔN) isoforms that act as antagonists to p53. The expression of TAp73-transcripts is induced by E2F and negatively regulated by transforming growth factor β (TGFβ). The ΔNp73 promoter is induced by p53, resulting in negative feedback to control p53 activity. Here, we have analysed the expression of p63 in comparison with p73. In contrast to the induction of ΔNp73, the expression of ΔNp63 was reduced by p53 particularly in human keratinocytes, at the mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, the 3′ promoter of p73, but not that of p63, was activated by p53 in reporter assays. ΔNp73 mRNA and ΔNp73 protein, but not the p63 gene products, also accumulated when HaCat cells (lacking functional p53) were grown to high density. TAp73, but not TAp63, expression was suppressed by TGFβ in these cells, and the TAp73, but not the TAp63, promoter was induced by E2F-1. Thus, in contrast to the functional similarities of their respective products, the expression levels of p63 and p73 are regulated by different mechanisms. This might be responsible for the discordant biological roles of p63 and p73 in development, as well as their deviant expression characteristics in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2007384310,"DNA microarray analysis has been applied to identify molecular markers of human hematological malignancies. However, the relatively low correlation between the abundance of a given mRNA and that of the encoded protein makes it important to characterize the protein profile directly, or ‘proteome,’ of malignant cells in addition to the ‘transcriptome.’ To identify proteins specifically expressed in leukemias, here we isolated AC133+ hematopoietic stem cell-like fractions from the bone marrow of 13 individuals with various leukemic disorders, and compared their protein profiles by two-dimensional electrophoresis. A total of 11 differentially expressed protein spots corresponding to 10 independent proteins were detected, and peptide fingerprinting combined with mass spectrometry of these proteins revealed them to include NuMA (nuclear protein that associates with the mitotic apparatus), heat shock proteins, and redox regulators. The abundance of NuMA in the leukemic blasts was significantly related to the presence of complex karyotype anomalies. Conditional expression of NuMA in a mouse myeloid cell line resulted in the induction of aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest in G2–M phases, and apoptosis. These results demonstrate the potential of proteome analysis with background-matched cell fractions obtained from fresh clinical specimens to provide insight into the mechanism of human leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034938652,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells express various markers of neuronal differentiation associated with deficient activity of the neuron-restricted silencer factor (NRSF). Here, we characterize mechanisms by which NRSF target genes are upregulated in SCLC and their functional consequences for cell survival. Since the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1 subunit gene, GLRA1, contains a sequence motif for NRSF binding (NRSE) within its 5' UTR, it served as a cellular surrogate marker for NRSF activity. Expression of GLRA1 in nontransformed cells is largely restricted to cells in the spinal cord, retina and brain stem. In experiments described here, we detected GLRA1 transcripts in three out of four SCLC-derived cell lines and in three of five biopsy samples obtained from SCLCs. In contrast, no GLRA1 transcripts were found in 10 nonmalignant nor 15 non-small-cell lung cancer biopsies. Consistent with this observation, NRSF-mediated suppression of an expression construct harbouring the NRSE of the GLRA1 (GLRA1 NRSE) gene was impaired in three of four 'classic' SCLC cell lines, whereas exogenous overexpression of NRSF in NRSF-deficient SCLC cell lines reconstituted silencing of the reporter plasmid. The level of NRSF transcripts as well as the level of specifically bound NRSF to the NRSE correlated with the level of GLRA1 transcripts in SCLC cell lines. Splice variants encoding truncated NRSF proteins and expressed in some SCLC did not antagonize the repression of NRSE-containing genes. Most interestingly, reconstitution of NRSF expression induced apoptosis in SCLC cells, suggesting that inhibition of NRSF activity is a crucial step in the carcinogenesis of a subgroup of SCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2027449551,"RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 are small GTPases that regulate cytoskeletal reorganization leading to changes in cell morphology and cell motility. Their signaling pathways are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have identified a novel RhoGAP, BPGAP1 (for BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP Homology (BCH) domaincontaining, Proline-rich and Cdc42GAP-like protein subtype-1), that is ubiquitously expressed and shares 54% sequence identity to Cdc42GAP/p50RhoGAP. BP-GAP1 selectively enhanced RhoA GTPase activity in vivo although it also interacted strongly with Cdc42 and Rac1. “Pull-down” and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that it formed homophilic or heterophilic complexes with other BCH domain-containing proteins. Fluorescence studies of epitope-tagged BPGAP1 revealed that it induced pseudopodia and increased migration of MCF7 cells. Formation of pseudopodia required its BCH and GAP domains but not the prolinerich region, and was differentially inhibited by coexpression of the constitutively active mutant of RhoA, or dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1. However, the mutant without the proline-rich region failed to confer any increase in cell migration despite the induction of pseudopodia. Our findings provide evidence that cell morphology changes and migration are coordinated via multiple domains in BPGAP1 and present a novel mode of regulation for cell dynamics by a RhoGAP protein.

Cells undergo dynamic changes as part of their adaptation and response to stimuli. These include their abilities to proliferate, differentiate, or execute death. Many of these processes are controlled by a series of signaling events relayed via a cascade of molecular interaction that are normally associated with the enzymatic or structural modifications of target proteins. Furthermore, there exist various checkpoints that serve to fine-tune the amplitude, duration, as well as the integration of such circuitry response. One of the relatively well characterized signaling circuits in eukaryotic system is the Ras small GTP-binding protein (GTPase) superfamily (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar, 2Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 3Mackay D.J.

The GTP-bound form assumes an active conformation that allows interaction with downstream effectors, thus the “on-switch,” whereas its conversion to the GDP-bound form keeps the proteins in an “off-switch” mode and renders the GTPase inactive. The balance of these two forms determines the final execution of the pathway. This is regulated by two other important classes of proteins, one that helps enhance its GTPase activity, termed GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; EST, expressed sequence tag; HA, hemagglutinin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; LD, longest diameter; SD, shortest diameter; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting; FL, full-length; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WCL, whole cell lysate.1The abbreviations used are: GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; EST, expressed sequence tag; HA, hemagglutinin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; LD, longest diameter; SD, shortest diameter; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblotting; FL, full-length; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WCL, whole cell lysate. and the other, termed guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that activate the protein by catalyzing its exchange of GDP for GTP. Many members of the small GTPases have already been identified, and they can further be subdivided into various families or subfamilies according to the similarities in their primary sequences. Members from different families exhibit diverse functions ranging from the control of intracellular trafficking to cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell cycle progression. The degree of specificity is further extended to even closely related members within the same families. For example, in the Rho family, the Cdc42 plays an important role in the formation of filopodia, whereas RhoA and Rac1 activation results in the formation of stress fibers and membrane ruffles respectively (4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a hierarchy of network in certain cell types where activation of one member can affect the activity of another. For example, activation of Cdc42 leads to filopodia formation, which could in turn activate Rac1 (5Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), whereas Rac1 activation leads to inactivation of RhoA in NIH3T3 resulting in the epithelioid phenotype (7Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A.

Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar). With an increasing number of known GTPases, there remain key questions as to how each one of them can be regulated by their GEFs, GAPs, or other regulators in vivo. The human genome is predicted to encode at least 50 members of the GAP family (11Moon S.Y. Zheng Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 12Peck J. Douglas G. Wu C.H. Burbelo P.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Current data show that various GAP domains exhibit overlapping substrate specificity both in vitro and in vivo but all involve a common mechanism of action by utilizing an “arginine-finger” motif in trans to stabilize the transition state of GTP hydrolysis (13Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, the p50RhoGAP (also known as Cdc42GAP) (15Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26059-26062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Harris P.M. Self A.J. Brill S. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) bind and inactivate mainly Cdc42 and RhoA, respectively. In comparison, p200RhoGAP targets RhoA and Rac1 but not Cdc42 (18Moon S.Y. Zang H. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4151-4159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) while p115RhoGAP confines its action mainly to RhoA (19Christerson L.B. Gallagher E. Vanderbilt C.A. Whitehurst A.W. Wells C. Kazempour R. Sternweis P.C. Cobb M.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that there is no specific GAP for a single GTPase. Instead, there exists a GAP that recognizes more than one GTPase, and a single GTPase can be a target of multiple GAPs. The molecular basis for such distinctive or overlapping recognition profile remains to be understood. Furthermore, most of these GAPs possess multiple signaling modules that could couple their activities to other signaling pathways. This could have far reaching consequences for the regulation of Rho and other small GTPase signals, and remains to be seen how, where, and when any subsets or combinations of these cellular counterparts will co-exist and exert their effects. In order to understand the specificity versus redundancy nature of the RhoGAPs as well as the roles of their various signaling modules, we have set out to study novel proteins that harbor the GAP domain together with other protein domains. Bioinformatic searches through the human genome public databases revealed a striking number of sequences that encode putative GAP proteins and with various arrays of domain organizations. One of the family proteins that we are interested in has the organization that is similar to that of the Cdc42GAP, yet exhibiting diversed sequences in other regions. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization for such a member in this family that harbors (from the proximal N terminus) a BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP Homology (BCH)/Sec14p-like domain that we first described (20Low B.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7483-7492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a proline-rich sequence, and a functional GAP domain. We showed that BP-GAP1 differentially modulates RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1 signaling pathway by a mechanism that required cooperation between the BCH and GAP domain. When expressed in non-metastatic human breast epithelial cancer cell lines MCF7 cells, BPGAP1 induced cell protrusions/pseudopodia that required its GAP activity as well as the BCH domain, but not the proline-rich sequence. However, the proline-rich region was required for ensuring cell migration following the morphological changes induced by both GAP and BCH domains. These results indicate the unique interplay by different domains of BPGAP1 in exerting cell dynamics and confirm that changes in cell morphology is a prerequisite but not necessarily the only determinant for cell migration, it requires the input of other factor(s) as well. Our findings also emphasize the need to address functions of distinct protein domains in various RhoGAP families in order to have a better understanding of their physiological functions and regulation. Bioinformatics—To identify novel proteins containing GAP domains, the peptide sequence of the RhoGAP domain of p50RhoGAP/Cdc42GAP (GenBank™ accession number: Q07960; residues: 260–439) was used as query sequence in the “position-specific iteractive BLAST” against the current non-redundant sequence as well as human and mouse EST databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Progress of the identification was described in the text. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using Vector NTI suite (InforMax, Inc.). RT-PCR Cloning of BPGAP1 Isoforms and Plasmid Constructions—To obtain the full-length cDNA of BPGAP1, total RNA was isolated from MCF7 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of this RNA was subjected to the first-strand cDNA synthesis with Expand Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Roche Applied Science) primed with oligo(dT) (Operon) for 60 min at 42 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. 0.5 μg of this cDNA was then amplified by the high fidelity, long-template Taq polymerase enzyme (Roche Applied Science) using specific primers corresponding to the putative sequence BAA91614. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation 94 °C, 2 min; subsequent cycling (30 cycles) at 94 °C, 10 s; annealing at 50 °C, 30 s; extension at 68 °C, 2 min; and final extension at 68 °C, 7 min. These PCR primers contained HindIII and XhoI restriction sites on the forward and reverse primers, respectively, to facilitate their subsequent cloning. The full-length PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen) and cloned into a FLAG epitope-tagged or GFP-tagged expression vector, pXJ40 (Dr. E. Manser, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). Sequence unique to BPGAP1 was obtained (GenBank™ AF544240), and fragments encoding its various domains were generated from the full-length template using specific primers in a standard PCR and then gel-purified for cloning. For each construct, several clones were chosen and sequenced entirely in both directions using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem). All plasmids were purified using Qiagen miniprep kit for subsequent use in transfection experiments. For generation of deletion mutants, inverse-PCR was carried out to exclude region of interest whereas point mutation R232A was performed by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (21Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used as host for the propagation of the clones. Reagents used were of analytical grade, and standard protocols for molecular manipulations and media preparation were as described (24Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY2001: 1.109-1.110Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—To distinguish the mRNA expression level of BPGAP1 and Cdc42GAP in various cells and tissues, RT-PCR using the oligo-dT primers was employed. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from either various cultured cell lines or from various organs obtained from a 2-week-old male mouse and primed for the first-strand cDNA synthesis as described above. Equal amounts of the reverse transcription product were then subjected to PCR amplification for BPGAP1 and Cdc42GAP. The full-length PCR products of BPGAP1 were then subjected to internal amplification using primers that encompass BPGAP1-specific BCH region that contained the unique insertion (see text). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to normalize the level of expression. The results were verified in at least two independent experiments with varying numbers of PCR cycles to ensure near-linear amplification. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human breast cancer MCF7, human embryonic kidney epithelial cells 293T, human stomach cancer lines MCN45 and KMN74 were all grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Hyclone), and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human cervical cancer epithelial HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), whereas human colon epithelial HT29 and HCT116 were grown in McCoy's medium (Sigma). Cells at 90% confluence in 100-mm plates or 6-well plates were transfected with 5 or 2 μg of indicated plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Precipitation/Pull-down Studies and Western Blot Analyses—Control 293T cells or cells transfected with expression plasmids were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Trition X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The lysates were directly analyzed, either as whole cell lysates (25 μg) or aliquots (500 μg) used in affinity precipitation/pull-down experiments with various GST fusion proteins (5 μg), as previously described (21Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Samples were run in SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting with FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates, transfected with various expression constructs for 16–20 h, and then stained for immunofluorescence detection as previously described (25Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images were taken with a confocal laser microscopy system (Fluoview, FV300, Olympus). FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with monoclonal anti-FLAG, followed by Texas Red® dye-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For cells co-expressing GFP-tagged recombinants and HA-tagged proteins, HA-tagged constructs were detected with polyclonal anti-HA, followed by Texas Red® dye-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. For cells expressing only GFP-tagged recombinants, the morphology of cells was examined directly under a fluorescent microscope after the transfection for 16–20 h as previously described (23Zhou Y.T. Soh U.J. Shang X. Guy G.R. Low B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7483-7492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose beads. In brief, E. coli cells were lysed by sonication in a HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl2, 1 mm EDTA, multiple protein inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% (w/v) Triton-100). Following centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), the supernatants of lysates were mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for overnight. Beads were washed three times with 10 ml of HEPES buffer. When needed, fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione solution in the HEPES buffer. Protein concentrations were measured by using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). In Vitro GTPase Activity Assay—GTPase activity assays were performed with the Enz-check™ Phosphate Assay kit (E-6646, Molecular Probes) to monitor the rate of phosphate release from GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by recombinant Cdc42, RhoA, or Rac1 (pGEX plasmids of these and Cdc42GAP are gifts from Dr. A. Hall, University College London, United Kingdom) in the presence of GST control or GST-BPGAP1 full-length, domains, or its mutant. For these assays, we used a previously described protocol (26Wu G. Li H. Yang Z. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, 0.5 nmol of purified GST-BPGAP1 full-length, domains, or mutant proteins (in a volume of 15 μl), was mixed in a cuvette with 10 μl of 0.2 mm GTP, 0.2 ml of 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside, 10 μl (1 unit) of purine nucleotide phosphorylase, and 0.78 ml of HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). The cuvette was immediately placed in the spectrophotometer to monitor absorbance at 360 nm (A 360). 10 μl of 1 m MgCl2 solution was added to 0.25 nmol of eluted GST, GST-Cdc42, GST-RhoA, or GST-Rac1 fusion proteins and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. When the first multiple turnover reached an equilibrium at A 360, the second mixture of small GTPase solution was added to initiate the reaction. The reading at A 360 was recorded every 10 s. In Vivo GTPase Activity and Binding Assay—GTP-bound Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA was determined by specific binding to the p21-binding domain of PAK1 (GST-PBD) (27Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) or rhotekin (GST-RBD) (28Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) (all kindly provided by Dr. Simone Schoenwaelder; Monash University, Australia). In brief, cell lysates expressing HA-tagged wild-type small GTPases (Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA) with or without FLAG-tagged BPGAP1 were incubated with 5 μg of recombinant GST-PBD or GST-RBD conjugated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, washed with buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors and 5 mm sodium orthovanadate) and separated on SDS-PAGE. Bound Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science). Whole cell lysates were also analyzed for the presence of expressed Cdc42, Rac1, RhoA, and BPGAP1 for normalization. For detecting binding of endogeneous Rho GTPases, the following antibodies were used: polyclonal anti-Cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal anti-RhoA, and monoclonal anti-Rac1 (both from Upstate Biotechnology). Co-immunoprecipitation—293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-BPGAP1 full length alone or together with either HA-BPGAP1, HA-Cdc42GAP, HA-BNIP-2 or HA-GTPases. Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) and the associated proteins separated on SDS-PAGE, and probed with anti-Cdc42, RhoA, Rac1, or HA antibodies to reveal the binding of targets. Cell Measurement—MCF7 cells were transfected with GFP control or GFP-tagged BPGAP1 full-length, NP, and PC domains. After 20 h, the longest diameter (LD) and shortest diameter (SD) that bisected the center of cells and perpendicular to each were measured (29Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The total cell areas and the length of the cell protrusion (PT) were also measured after image capturing as previously described and analyzed using the Leica IM 1000 software. Measurements were means and S.D. from three separate experiments, each time with at least 30 different cells. Statistical comparison was made using ANOVA (StatsDirect). p values of <0.01 indicate significant difference compared with the vector control. Cell Migration Assay—The ability of cells to migrate through coated filters was measured with a modified Boyden chamber (24-well Transwell, Corning Costar; 8-μm pore size) as previous described (30Koo T.H. Lee J.J. Kim E.M. Kim K.W. Kim H.D. Lee J.H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4080-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The lower surface of the filters was coated with 0.5-μg fibronectin (Sigma) as a chemoattractant. MCF7 cells transiently transfected with GFP vector, GFP-BPGAP1 full-length, different fragments, or mutants were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The lower compartment was added with 600 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After incubation for 1 day at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells that did not penetrate the filters were completely wiped off with cotton swabs, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter were fixed with methanol and counted. Three independent experiments were performed for each experimental condition. The data were represented as the means of three independent experiments with S.D. indicated. Statistical comparison was made using ANOVA (StatsDirect). p values of <0.01 indicate significant difference compared with the vector control. Identifying Novel GTPase-activating Proteins—To identify novel GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) encoded in the human genome and to gain an insight on how they might regulate various cellular processes through their various protein modules, we undertook bioinformatics approach and employed the Conserved Domain Architecture Retrieval Tool (CDART) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) with the well characterized GAP domain of Cdc42GAP/p50RhoGAP as the query sequence. We have identified in silico many classes of proteins across species that harbor the homologous GAP domain together with other unique signaling protein domains. Some of them include the Pleckstrin homology domain, Src homology-3 domain, Fes/CIP4 homology domain, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain, and the p21 Rho binding domain. One of these classes is represented by several putative members that resemble the organization of the Cdc42GAP protein. They are typified by the presence, at the proximal N terminus, of the newly identified BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP homology (BCH)/Sec14p-like domain that we first described in the BNIP-2 family (20Low B.C.

Present in between these two domains is a proline-rich moiety. Based on the predicted open reading frame from one of the putative sequences deposited, BAA91614, several conserved primers were designed and used in reverse-transcription-based PCR to isolate the full-length cDNA from human MCF7 cells. Interestingly, one unique sequence of cDNA was repeatedly identified (Fig. 1A), which codes for a protein that differs from BAA91614 by lacking 31 amino acids (Fig 1B , upper line). The protein also differs at the N terminus, from two putative proteins encoded from the same human ARHGAP8 locus (GenBank™ accession numbers: Q9NSG0 and AF195968). Despite using primers specific to those variants, we had not identified the full contigs for such transcripts in all samples examined thus far. Many classes of GAPs have been identified from the human genome and labeled ARHGAP1–12. However, they are not related to each other as each one carries different types and numbers of other associated protein domains. To provide meaningful reference to the specific subclass of GAP with its unique domain organization, we propose to name this family of proteins BPGAPs (for BCH domain-containing, proline-rich, and Cdc42GAP-like proteins) with their notable three-domain organization. We further sought to understand how one novel member we identified here, BPGAP1 (GenBank™ accession number: AF544240), regulates cellular processes via these protein domains. Efforts are underway to isolate the full contigs for other putative isoforms, BPGAP2 (represented by BAA91614), BPGAP3 (AF195968), and the longest subtype, BPGAP4 (Q9NSG0). It is believed that these isoforms could be derived from alternative RNA splicing of the same gene. A mouse homolog with 88% similarity to human BPGAP1 was also identified from the genome data base (encoded by accession NP_082731 or AI430858). Compared with Cdc42GAP, BPGAP1 displays unique divergence at various regions. Notably, the BPGAP1 has a much shorter sequence at the N terminus but a much longer C tail than Cdc42GAP (Fig. 2A). To understand the degree of similarity or divergence for the BCH and GAP domains, more detailed comparisons were made with similar domains found in other proteins. The BCH domain of BPGAP1 is more closely related to that of Cdc42GAP (84% similarity) (Fig. 2B) while its GAP domain also shares the highest degree of homology with that of Cdc42GAP (Fig. 2C). More importantly, BPGAP1 contains an invariant arginine at residue 232 (Fig. 2C, indicated by an arrow). This residue in other functional GAPs is known as an “arginine finger” and shown to be critical for acting as a catalytic residue in-trans (13Nassar N. Hoffman G.R. Manor D. Clardy J.C. Cerione R.A.

In addition, BPGAP1 possesses several more proline residues in the proline-rich sequence, which is very similar to those identified in RNB6, ena-VASP-like and cdc-related proteins (Fig. 2D). It could comprise more than o"

https://openalex.org/W1975636695,"Overexpression of proto-oncogene c-jun and constitutive activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway have been implicated in the leukemic transformation process. However, c-jun expression and the role of the JNK signaling pathway have not been investigated in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with frequently observed balanced rearrangements such as t(8;21). In the present study, we report elevated c-jun mRNA expression in AML patient bone marrow cells with t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16), and a high correlation in mRNA expression levels of AML1-ETO and c-jun within t(8;21)-positive AML patient cells. In myeloid U937 cells, c-jun mRNA and protein expression increase upon inducible expression of AML1-ETO. AML1-ETO transactivates the human c-jun promoter through the proximal activator protein (AP-1) site by activating the JNK pathway. Overexpression of JNK-inhibitor JIP-1 and chemical JNK inhibitors reduce the transactivation capacity of AML1-ETO on the c-jun promoter and the proapoptotic function of AML1-ETO in U937 cells. An autocrine mechanism involving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) might participate in AML1-ETO mediated JNK-signaling, because AML1-ETO induces G-CSF and G-CSF-R expression, and G-CSF-R-neutralizing antibodies reduce AML1-ETO-induced JNK phosphorylation. These data suggest a model in which AML1-ETO induces proto-oncogene c-jun expression via the proximal AP-1 site of the c-jun promoter in a JNK-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2085337315,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their receptors play an important role in cell proliferation, angiogenesis and embryonal development. In this study, we show that expression of the FGF receptor-2 (FGFR-2) protein is induced in the mid-to-late G1 phase of the cell cycle in serum-starved mouse NIH3T3 cells released from starvation. Transcription of mouse FGFR-2 was activated by E2F-1. Analysis of various mouse FGFR-2 promoter mutant constructs showed that a sequence located +57/+64 downstream of the transcriptional initiation site, related to the consensus E2F-responsive sequence, is necessary for the activation. The promoter activity of the mouse FGFR-2 gene is also positively regulated by E2F-2 and E2F-3, but not by E2F-4 and E2F-5. Moreover, the E2F-1-induced activation of mouse FGFR-2 gene transcription is suppressed by pRB. Taken together, the results demonstrate that FGFR-2 is a new class of targets for E2F, and expression of mouse FGFR-2 in mid-to-late G1 phase would be mediated, at least in part, by the activation of a pRB/E2F pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2004121812,"The neurotrophins neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived growth factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) bind to the p75 receptor, but each neurotrophin also binds a more selective Trk receptor (e.g. TrkA-NGF and TrkC-NT-3). The biochemical signals following engagement of either Trk or p75 with ligands are well understood, but long-term biological outcomes (trophic, proapoptotic or differentiative) remain unclear because they are cell/tissue specific. For example, Trk receptors are usually trophic but when overexpressed they can be proapoptotic in neuroblastomas and medulloblastomas. We hypothesized that coexpression of Trk and p75 receptors may lead to cross-regulation of signals and different biological outcomes; and used receptor-selective ligands to study cross-regulation by these receptors. We show that in the absence of Trk activation, expression of TrkC is permissive of p75 trophic and differentiation signals induced by p75 ligands, whereas expression of TrkA abolishes trophic and differentiation signals induced by p75 ligands. In contrast, in the presence of Trk activation, p75 ligands can regulate TrkA-mediated survival and TrkC-mediated differentiation. Therefore, a complex homeostasis of p75-selective and Trk-selective signals may determine the fate of cells expressing both receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1984954505,"Investigations determined the relative preference of prekallikrein (PK) or factor XI/XIa (FXI/FXIa) binding to endothelial cells (HUVECs). In microtiter plates, biotinylated high molecular weight kininogen (biotin-HK) or biotin-FXI binding to HUVEC monolayers or their matrix proteins, but not fibronectin-coated plastic microtiter plate wells, was specifically blocked by antibodies to each of the receptors of HK, uPAR, gC1qR, or cytokeratin 1. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-PK specifically bound to HUVEC suspensions without added Zn2+, whereas FITC-FXI or -FXIa binding to HUVEC suspensions required 10 μm added Zn2+ to support specific binding. Plasma concentrations of FXI did not block FITC-PK binding to HUVECs in the absence or presence of 10 μm Zn2+. In the absence of HK, the level of FITC-FXI or -FXIa binding was half that seen in its presence. At physiologic concentrations, PK (450 nm) abolished FITC-FXI or -FXIa binding to HUVEC suspensions in the absence or presence of HK in the presence of 10 μm Zn2+.

At physiologic concentrations, PK also abolished FXI binding to HUVECs in the presence of activated platelets, but FXI did not influence PK binding. PK in the presence or absence of HK preferentially bound to HUVECs over FXI or FXIa. Elevated Zn2+ concentrations are required for FXI but not PK binding, but the presence of physiologic concentrations of PK and HK also prevented FXI binding.

Prekallikrein activation on HUVECs contributes to single-chain urokinase activation, and FXI activation on platelets contributes to thrombin formation. We sought to determine if there is a preference for one or the other of these proteins to assemble on cultured endothelial cell membranes under physiologic zinc ion concentrations and platelet activation states. The critical protein that serves as the receptor for PK and FXI on endothelial cells is high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HK specifically binds to endothelial cell membranes (3Schmaier A.H. Kuo A. Lundberg D. Murray S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16327-16333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Van Iwaarden F. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4698-4703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured endothelial cells (HUVECs) are chilled to 4 °C, there are 0.93–2.6 × 106 HK binding sites/endothelial cell on confluent monolayers in microtiter plate wells (3Schmaier A.H. Kuo A. Lundberg D. Murray S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16327-16333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Van Iwaarden F. de Groot P.G. Bouma B.N. J. Biol.

Alternatively, when HUVECs are maintained at 37 °C, there are 1 × 107 HK binding sites/HUVEC monolayers (5Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of HK binding to endothelial cells grown to confluence in microtiter plate wells or proteins related to the cultured cells has been shown by a number of techniques. First, treatment of endothelial cells with Pronase completely eliminates HK binding to microtiter plate wells (5Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, treatment of endothelial cells with the metabolic inhibitors of aerobic metabolism (antimycin A), anaerobic metabolism (2-deoxy-d-glucose), and d-gluconic acid δ lactone completely abolishes HK binding to cultured endothelial cells (5Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, antibodies to three of the HK endothelial cell membrane-binding proteins, gC1qR, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, or cytokeratin 1, but not their corresponding non-immune IgG, block biotin-HK binding to HUVEC microtiter plates (7Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Todd III, R.F. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Last, when labeled HK binds to confluent monolayers of HUVECs in microtiter plates, at least 66% of the total amount of binding seen is associated with the matrix of the cultured HUVECs and not the cells themselves (8Motta G. Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Sampaio C.A.M. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). PK specifically binds to endothelial cell monolayers or suspensions in both the presence and absence of HK (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PK binding to HK on HUVECs is completely blocked by antibody to the HK binding region and a peptide of PK binding region on HK (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, FXI or factor XIa (FXIa) specifically binds to endothelial cell monolayers mostly in the presence of HK (2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibodies to the HK-binding proteins on the external membrane of endothelial cells and the FXI binding region on HK also completely block FXI binding to HK on cultured endothelial cells monolayers (2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Shariat-Mada Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 1841-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). FXI or FXIa binding to HUVECs in the absence or presence of HK requires ≥7 μm free Zn2+, unlike HK binding alone, which only requires 0.3 μm free Zn2+ in buffer that contains gelatin, a carrier protein that does not bind zinc (2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Zhao Y. Qiu Q. Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Rojkjaer R. Schmaier A.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H821-H1829Google Scholar). Although the total Zn2+ concentration in plasma is 15–25 μm, the free Zn2+ concentration in plasma, i.e. the Zn2+ concentration that is not protein bound, is only 0.3 μm. These data suggest that, under physiologic circumstances, FXI does not bind to HUVECs (11Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Motta G. Schousboe I. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Whitehouse R.C. Prasad A.S. Rabbani P.I. Cossack Z.T.

Recent studies, however, question the validity of the above-cited HK and FXI binding studies to HUVECs (14Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38462-38467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because HK itself has the ability to bind to plastic microtiter plates, a negatively charged surface, these authors claim that the extent of HK and, subsequently, FXI or FXIa binding to HK on HUVEC monolayers is really an artifact of HK binding to the plastic wells (14Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol.

It also examines the relative likelihood of PK or FXI binding to HUVEC suspensions under simulated physiologic conditions where the free zinc ion concentration is manipulated between 0.3 to 10 μm. These studies indicated that HK binding is specific to cells and its matrix and PK is the predominant protein ligand of HK on endothelial cells regardless of the ambient Zn2+ concentration. Materials—Human factor XI (FXI) (188–200 units/mg), single chain high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (13 units/mg), human prekallikrein (PK) (22 units/mg), and human factor XIa (FXIa) (265–341 units/mg) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN) or Haematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). All preparations were characterized by non-reduced and reduced SDS-PAGE, coagulant or amidolytic activity, and protein concentration prior to use. Biotinylation kits, ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase, and peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (turbo-TMP) were obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) protein labeling kits were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), endothelial cell growth medium, trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin-neutralizing solutions were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody to gC1qR (clone 74.5.2) was purchased from Covance Research Products, Inc. (Richmond, CA). Monoclonal antibody against uPAR (3B10FC) was generously provided by Dr. Robert F. Todd III at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). A goat anti-human cytokeratin 1 antibody (anti-GPV20) to the HK binding region on cytokeratin 1 was prepared and characterized as previously reported (7Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Todd III, R.F. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2001; 97: 2342-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. J. Biol.

Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Labeling of Factors XI, XIa, PK, or HK—Biotinylation: FXI, FXIa, PK, or HK in 4 mm sodium acetate-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 5.3, were dialyzed against 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m, NaCl, pH 7.4, and biotinylated according to the procedure of Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL) (5Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–2 mg of FXI, FXIa, PK, or HK in 200-μl volume in 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (PBS), were incubated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in 5-fold molar excess of Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to each protein. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the samples were then loaded onto 10-ml Econo-Pac I0 DG columns (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) and collected in 1-ml fractions. Biotinylated-FXI, -PK, or -HK (biotin-FXI, -PK, or -HK) were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm using their extinction coefficient and a protein assay (Bio-Rad). The specific activity of each labeled protein was determined using coagulant and protein assays, and the integrity of each protein after labeling was examined by reduced 10% SDS-PAGE. Biotin-FXI, -PK, or -HK had a specific activity of 195, 19, or 11 units/mg, respectively, indicating that the proteins were labeled without loss of activity. FITC Labeling—FXI, FXIa, and prekallikrein were also fluorescein-labeled according to the procedure of Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Briefly, 2 mg of FXI, FXIa, or PK in 200 μl was dialyzed into 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (17Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The dialyzed proteins were transferred into the reaction tube, and 20 μl of 1 m sodium bicarbonate at pH 9 was added to the protein. The fluorescein isothiocyanate was then added to the reaction mixture in 5-fold molar excess of each of the proteins. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 1 h while protected from light. At the conclusion of the incubation, 7 μl of the hydroxylamine was added to the conjugation reaction and was stirred at room temperature for an additional 30 min. The labeled FXI, FXIa, or PK was then loaded dropwise to the center of the spin column and adsorbed into the gel bed. The spin column was centrifuged for 5 min at 1100 × g. After centrifugation, the FITC-labeled FXI, FXIa, or PK was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of each protein. The specific activity of FITC-FXI, -FXIa, or -PK was measured to be 180, 196, or 18 units/mg, respectively, using a clotting or amidolytic assay, and the integrity of each labeled protein was examined on reduced 10% SDS-PAGE (1Motta G. Rojkjaer R. Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 516-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). No activation of the zymogens occurred during the labeling procedure. Endothelial Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained and cultured according to the distributor's recommendations. Cells between the 1st and 5th passages were subcultured onto fibronectin-treated (1 μg/well) 96-well microtiter plates 24 h prior to the start of the experiment. Cell viability on culture plates or in suspension was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Cell numbers were determined by counting on a hemocytometer. Isolation of Human Platelets—Fresh whole blood was collected from individual normal volunteers into one-tenth volume of 1 μm Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone in saline (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and centrifuged at 180 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The platelet-rich plasma was removed, and its pH was adjusted to 6.5, and prostaglandin I2 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 1 μm final concentration, was added. The platelet-rich plasma was then centrifuged at 1200 × g for 10 min at room temperature. After removing the plasma, the platelet pellet was re-suspended in Hepes-carbonate gelatin buffer (HCG) (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 14.7 mm Hepes, 5.5 mm dextrose containing 0.1% gelatin, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2), pH 6.5, containing 250 μm Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (Sigma) and centrifuged again at 1200 × g for 10 min. The final platelet pellet was re-suspended in HCG buffer, pH 7.4, and the platelets were counted in a Z1-series Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) (17Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In all studies, the washed platelets were examined for their ability to aggregate (Chronolog Aggregometer, Hatboro, PA) to 5 μg/ml collagen (Nycomed Arzneimittel, Munchen, Germany). Preparation of the Extracellular Matrix—Confluent monolayers of HUVECs in 96-well microtiter plates (F96 Cert MAXISORB, #439454, Nunc Immunoplate, Fisher Scientific, Chicago, IL) were washed with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (PBS), and then removed after 15-min treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The plate was then incubated with 0.025 m NH4OH for 10 min. The matrix was washed five times with 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 followed by washing five times with HCG buffer, pH 7.4 (8Motta G. Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All the incubations were performed under the same conditions in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In all cases after this treatment, no cells were detected by light microscopy of the microtiter plates. HK Binding to Endothelial Cell Monolayers, Plastic, or Matrix— Biotin-HK binding was performed on confluent monolayers of HUVECs in 96-well microtiter plates, microtiter plate wells treated with 1 μg/ml fibronectin (plastic), or HUVEC-generated matrix in 96-well microtiter plates. After washing the cells, empty plastic wells, or the matrix with HCG, pH 7.4, the microtiter plate wells were incubated with a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 10 nm biotin-HK in the absence or presence of 1 μm HK or antibodies to uPAR, gC1qR, human cytokeratin (anti-GPV20), mouse IgG, or goat IgG for 60 min at 37 °C. The relative amount of biotin-HK binding to the cells, plastic, or matrix was determined using ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, turbo-TMP (Pierce), as previously described (5Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound biotin-HK was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a microplate auto reader EL 311 from Bio-Tek Instruments (Winooski, VT). FXI Binding to Endothelial Cell Monolayers, Plastic, or Matrix, in the Presence of HK—Biotin-XI binding was performed on confluent monolayers of HUVECs on 96-well microtiter plates, microtiter plate wells treated with 1 μg/well of fibronectin, or HUVEC matrix. After washing the microtiter plate wells with HCG, pH 7.4, the cells, plastic, or matrix were incubated with a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 40 nm HK in the absence or presence of 1 μm antibodies to uPAR, gC1qR, cytokeratin 1, mouse IgG, or goat IgG for 60 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells, plastic, or matrix were washed three times with HCG, pH 7.4, followed by addition of 100 μl of 10 nm biotin-FXI in HCG containing 10 μm Zn2+ and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. The relative biotin-FXI binding to the cells, plastic, or matrix was determined using ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, turbo-TMP, as previously described (5Hasan A.A.K. Cines D.B. Ngaaiza J.R. Jaffe E.A. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3134-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bound biotin-FXI was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a microplate autoreader EL 311 from Bio-Tek Instruments. FITC-PK Binding to Endothelial Cell Suspensions—FITC-PK binding to HUVEC suspensions was established. HUVECs were detached from culture flasks with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and washed with HCG, pH 7.4, followed by re-suspension in the same buffer. The viability of these cells was assured by trypan blue exclusion. Initial experiments determined the optimal concentration for specific FITC-PK binding to HUVECs in suspension and the requirement for added Zn2+. Binding experiments were performed in 200-μl reaction mixtures containing 100 nm FITC-PK and 154 nm HK in the absence or presence of 5 μm PK, 30 nm FXI, and/or 10 μm Zn2+. These HUVEC (4 × 104 cells/well) suspensions in HCG, pH 7.4, in a 96-well filtration plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were incubated on a pre-wetted hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (pore size, 1.2 μm) with low protein binding capacity for 0–120 min at 37 °C as described previously (17Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Sheng N. Fairbanks M.B. Heinrikson R.L. Canziani G. Chaiken I.R. Mosser D.M. Zhang H. Colman R.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 3788-3795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed by vacuum absorption and filtered using multiScreen Separation System Vacuum Manifold from Millipore (Bedford MA). The fluorescence of cell-bound FITC-PK to HUVECs bound to the PVDF membrane of the filtration plate was measured on a CytoFluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader from PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. (Framingham, MA) with 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filters. FITC-FXI or FITC-FXIa Binding to Endothelial Cell Suspensions— FITC-FXI or FITC-XIa binding to HUVEC suspensions was also established. HUVECs were detached from culture plates with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen) and washed with HCG, pH 7.4, followed by re-suspension in the same buffer. Initial experiments determined the optimal concentration for specific FITC-FXI or FITC-XIa binding to HUVEC suspensions. The binding was performed in 200-μl reaction mixtures containing 80 nm FITC-FXI or FITC-XIa in the presence or absence of 600 nm HK and the presence or absence of 10 μm Zn2+ and/or 450 nm PK. HUVECs (4 × 104 cells/well) suspensions in HCG, pH 7.4, in a 96-well filtration plate were incubated on a pre-wetted hydrophilic PVDF membrane (pore size, 1.2 μm) with low protein binding capacity (Millipore, Bedford, MA.) for 0–120 min at 37 °C as described previously (17Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 19Sheng N. Fairbanks M.B. Heinrikson R.L. Canziani G. Chaiken I.R. Mosser D.M.

At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed by vacuum absorption and filtered using multiScreen Separation System Vacuum Manifold from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The fluorescence of cell bound FITC-FXI or FITC-XIa to HUVECs bound to the PVDF membrane of the filtration plate was measured on CytoFluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader from PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. with 485-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filters. FXI and Prekallikrein Binding to HUVECs in the Presence of Nonactivated or Activated Platelets—Confluent monolayers of HUVECs were washed three times with HCG, pH 7.4. Biotin-FXI (10 nm) in 100 μl was incubated with HUVEC monolayers in the presence of 40 nm HK and an increasing concentration of platelets (2–8 × 108/ml) in the absence of Zn2+ and in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml collagen. The cells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C on a rotating mixer maintained at 50 rpm. In control experiments, 10 nm biotin-FXI was incubated with HUVECs in HCG, pH 7.4, containing 40 nm HK in the absence or presence of 10 μm Zn+2. In other experiments, 10 nm biotin-FXI in the presence of 40 nm HK was incubated with HUVECs and activated platelets in the absence or presence of 450 nm PK. In similar experiments, biotin-PK (40 nm) and HK (600 nm) in 100-μl reaction mixtures were added to HUVEC monolayers with increasing concentration of platelets (2–8 × 108/ml) in the absence of Zn2+ and in the absence or presence of 5 μg/ml collagen. The cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C on a rotating mixer maintained at 50 rpm. In control experiments, 40 nm biotin-PK and 600 nm HK were directly incubated with HUVEC monolayers in the absence or presence of 10 μm Zn2+. In other experiments, 40 nm biotin-PK was incubated with HUVECs and collagen-activated platelets in the presence of 600 nm HK in the absence or presence of 30 nm FXI. After completion of all incubations, all cells were washed three times with HCG, and the relative amount of biotin-FXI or biotin-PK bound to the adherent HUVECs was determined using ImmunoPure streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) and peroxidase-specific fast reacting substrate, turbo-TMP (17Mahdi F. Shariat-Madar Z. Figueroa C.D. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 2002; 99: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Bound biotin-FXI or -PL was measured by the absorbance of the reaction mixture at 450 nm using a microplate auto reader EL 311 from Bio-Tek Instruments. Measurement of Zn2 + after Platelet-Endothelial Cell Interactions— The concentration of the Zn2+ in the collagen-treated platelet releasates was measured by colorimetric assay (20Rojkjaer R. Schousboe I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A Zn2+standard curve was determined by adding 10 μl of known amount of Zn2+ (0.1–30 μm) or samples of collagen-treated platelet releasates with 90 μl of 20 μm 5-Br-PAPS (Wako Chemicals Inc., Richmond, VA) in 0.01 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The complex formation of Zn2+ with 5-Br-PAPS was monitored at 552 nm absorbance. Specificity of HK Binding to HUVECs in Microtiter Plates— Recent investigations claimed that HK binding to endothelial cells in microtiter plates is an artifact of the HK binding to plastic alone (14Baird T.R.

https://openalex.org/W2091181823,"DNA methylation occurs in most organisms from bacteria to mammals and provides a mechanism for epigenetic control of a variety of cellular processes. In Escherichia coli, most of the N 6 positions in adenines found in the sequence GATC are methylated by DNA adenine methyltransferase. After DNA replication, the GATC sites exist transiently in the hemimethylated state, and the specific recognition of these hemimethylated GATC sites is essential for several processes, including sequestration of the site of replication initiation by the SeqA protein, strand discrimination in DNA mismatch repair by the MutH protein, and transcription of several genes. Here, we characterize the solution structure and dynamics of two dodecamer DNA duplexes that each contains a single GATC site in either unmethylated or hemimethylated state. We found that the N 6-methylated adenine of a hemimethylated GATC site undergoes a slow trans-cis interconversion. The release of a tightly bound cation from hemimethylated DNA explains the instability of this structure. In addition, quantitative structural analysis revealed that hemimethylated DNA has unusual backbone structures and a remarkably narrow major groove. These dynamic and structural features provide insights into the specific recognition of hemimethylated GATC sites by the SeqA protein.

In addition, quantitative structural analysis revealed that hemimethylated DNA has unusual backbone structures and a remarkably narrow major groove. These dynamic and structural features provide insights into the specific recognition of hemimethylated GATC sites by the SeqA protein. DNA methylation occurs in organisms as diverse as bacteria and mammals and provides a mechanism for the epigenetic control of the timing and targeting of several types of cellular functions (1Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sites commonly methylated by DNA methyltransferases are the C5 and N 4 positions of cytosine and the N 6 position of adenine. Most DNA methyltransferases recognize palindromic DNA sequences, and methylated DNA sites can exist in the unmethylated, hemimethylated, or fully methylated states (for example, GATC/GATC, GATC/GAmTC, or GAmTC/GAmTC, respectively, with Am representing N6 -methylated adenine). In Escherichia coli, most of the N6 positions of adenines that occur in the sequence GATC are methylated by DNA adenine methyltransferase (2Lacks S. Greenberg B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 114: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). GATC sites are found more frequently in translated regions of the genome than in non-coding and non-translated sequences, with the exception of the rRNA cluster and some tRNA genes. The spacing between GATC sites never exceeds 2 kb (3Barras F. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9821-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The E. coli chromosomal origin of replication (oriC) has eleven GATC sites. After DNA replication, the SeqA protein binds specifically to hemimethylated GATC sites within oriC and delays remethylation of these sites for 8-10 min (about one third of the cell cycle). This binding prevents multiple initiations of replication within a single round of the cell cycle (4Ogden G.B. Pratt M.J. Schaechter M. Cell. 1988; 54: 127-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Russell D.W. Zinder N. Cell. 1987; 50: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).In addition to this role in the control of replication initiation, hemimethylated GATC sites constitute a critical factor in the regulation of other cellular processes. GATC sites that are located within chromosomal sequences other than oriC have a much shorter hemimethylation half-life (2-4 s) after replication (6Stancheva I. Koller T. Sogo J.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6542-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the process of DNA mismatch repair, the transient presence of hemimethylated GATC sites allows the repair protein MutH to specifically recognize and cleave only the newly synthesized unmethylated DNA strand (7Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The transcription of genes such as dnaA2P, mioC, trpS, and trpR is induced when their promoters are transiently hemimethylated after replication (8Marinus M.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Theisen P.W. Grimwade A.C. Leonard J.A. Bogan J.A. Helmstetter C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The same strategy is utilized in the transcription of certain transposons (10Roberts J.M. Hoopes B.C. McClure W.R. Kleckner N. Cell. 1985; 43: 117-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).The crystal structure of a single N6 -methylated adenine base showed that the methyl group attached at the adenine N6 position points toward the hydrogen bonding interface of the Watson-Crick base pair (the cis form, Fig. 1A) (11Sternglanz H. Bugg C.E. Science. 1973; 182: 833-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This study led to the suggestion that methylation of adenine N6 would disrupt the secondary structure of the DNA double helix (11Sternglanz H. Bugg C.E. Science. 1973; 182: 833-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Engel J.D. Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 927-934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, structural studies of double-stranded oligonucleotides revealed that N6 -methylated adenine forms a normal Watson-Crick base pair with the thymine in the complementary DNA strand (with the trans form, Fig. 1A), and there is no significant conformational difference between methylated DNA and unmethylated DNA with the same nucleotide sequence. These studies, however, demonstrated that the adenine N6 hemimethylated DNA has a lower melting temperature and distinct dynamic characteristics represented by slow duplex-single strand exchange (13Fazakerley G.V. Téoule R. Guy A. Fritzsche H. Guschlbauer W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Rinkel L.J. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Altona C. Eur. J.

Kennedy M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 719-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the solution structure and dynamics of two dodecamer DNA duplexes that contain either a single hemimethylated or unmethylated GATC site. Our study revealed that the N6 -methylated adenine of hemimethylated GATC undergoes a slow interconversion between the trans and cis forms without significant distortions of the double helix and that the instability of hemimethylated DNA is correlated with the easy release of a tightly bound cation at an elevated temperature. In addition to this unusual dynamics, quantitative structural analysis revealed that a hemimethylated GATC site has unusual metastable backbone structures and that the major groove width of a hemimethylated GATC site is remarkably narrow. These dynamic and structural features provide insights into the specific binding of hemimethylated GATC sites by SeqA.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSample Preparation—All DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on a solid support with an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. Adenine N6 -methylated strands were synthesized by using N6 -methylated 5′-dimethoxytrityl-N-benzoyl-2′-deoxyadenosine,3′-((2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl))phosphoramidite (dA-CE phosphoramidite; Glen Research, Inc.). The buffer conditions for NMR experiments were 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) and 100 mm sodium chloride unless otherwise specified.NMR Experiments—NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) 1The abbreviations used are: NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy. spectroscopy (NOESY) (τm = 240 ms) was carried out in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at 4 and 12 °C. Two-dimensional NOESY (τm = 60, 120, and 240 ms), two-dimensional double quantum filter correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) (τm = 80 ms), 1H-31P heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy, and rotational NOE spectroscopy (ROESY) (τm = 240 ms) were conducted in 99.96% D2O at 30 °C. One-dimensional natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC spectra were obtained at 0, 6, 12, 30, 42, 48, 54, 60, and 66 °C with selective carbon pulses for the adenine N6 -methyl group.Base Pair Exchange Kinetics—Selective longitudinal relaxation times were measured at increasing concentrations of NH3 ranging from 0 to 0.6 m at pH 8.8 and 15 °C. Selective inversion was achieved by an IBURP2-shaped (17Geek H. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 93-141Google Scholar) 180 pulse with a 1.5-kHz bandwidth centered at 12.96 ppm. The water signal was suppressed by a jump-and-return pulse sequence. Interpretation and analysis of the data followed the previously reported methods (18Guéron M. Leroy J.-L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar).DNA Binding of NH 4+ Ions—DNA binding of NH4+ ions was probed by one-dimensional 15N-decoupled 1H-15N HSQC spectra, which were acquired with ∼2 mm DNA, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), and 20 mm15NH4Cl. The 15N carrier was centered at 17.5 ppm, and the 1H sweep width was 20 ppm. 32 scans of 32768 complex points were acquired for each spectrum.Structure Calculation—The distance constraints were derived from the integrated NOE volumes and three assumed isotropic correlation times (τc = 3, 4, and 5 ns) using a relaxation matrix analysis program, MARDIGRAS (19Borgias B.A. James T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 176: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The δ dihedral angle was derived from the analysis of 3JH1′-H2′ in double quantum filter correlation spectroscopy. χ was constrained to 220 ± 45° based on the medium-to-weak intra-residue H6/H8-H1′ NOE. α and ζ were unconstrained, and other backbone dihedral angles were loosely constrained to the standard B-form (β (180 ± 30°), γ (60 ± 30°), and ϵ (230 ± 70°)), except that γ was unconstrained for the hemimethylated DNA. Scalar 1JCH and dipolar 1DCH couplings were derived from natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC experiments with and without Pf1 (∼10 mg/ml) at 30 °C. Pf1 filamentous bacteriophage was purchased from ASLA, Ltd. Alignment tensor analysis of the observed residual dipolar couplings was performed as described previously (20Bae S.-H. Cheong H.-K. Lee J.-H. Cheong C. Kainosho M. Choi B.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10602-10607Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All structure calculations were performed by crystallography and NMR system (CNS) software (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). Two extended strands were used as the starting structure, which was subjected to 60 ps of torsion angle dynamics at 20,000 K, followed by 60 ps of torsion angle dynamics cooling to 0 K and 40 ps of Cartesian dynamics cooling from 3,000 to 0 K. The final structures were generated after 2,000 cycles of energy minimization. The distance force constant was 50 kcal mol-1·Å-2, and the dihedral angle force constant, which initially was 5, was scaled to 250 kcal mol-1·radian-2 during cooling. The force constant for the residual dipolar coupling energy function was 3 kcal mol-1. For unmethylated DNA, 18 of 100 trial structures were converged. For hemimethylated DNA, each set of structure calculations was performed for the trans and cis isomers (selected converged structures were 16 of 100 for both). The final structures were analyzed by MOLMOL (22Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6469) Google Scholar), 3DNA (23Lu X.-J. Shakked Z. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 819-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and Curves 5.2 (24Lavery, R., and Skelenar, H. (1997) CURVES 5.2, Helical Analysis of Irregular Nucleic Acids, Biochimie Theorique, CNRS URA 77, ParisGoogle Scholar) software.RESULTSIdentification of 1H and 13C Resonances of N6-Methyl Group—In the H2O-NOESY (τm = 240 ms) of hemimethylated DNA, T19 and T7 imino resonances showed medium intensity NOEs with a ∼2.5 ppm resonance (Fig. 2B and D). This chemical shift is usually associated with H2′ and H2″ resonances; however, the distance between the imino proton and the H2′/ H2″ protons is > ∼5 Å in normal A- or B-form DNA helices. Consistently, no NOE was observed in the corresponding region of the H2O-NOESY obtained with the unmethylated DNA (data not shown). Natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC showed that this proton is attached to a carbon whose 13C chemical shift is ∼34 ppm, which is an intermediate between sugar C2′ (∼40 ppm) and T-methyl carbon (∼15 ppm) chemical shifts. Improved resolution of D2O 1H-13C HSQC spectra showed that this cross-peak actually consists of two cross-peaks (Fig. 2A) and that the cross-peak between them has the same sign as the diagonal peak in a D2O rotational NOE spectroscopy spectrum (τm = 240 ms) (Fig. 2, A and C), implying that this cross-peak originated from the exchange of conformations with two different magnetic environments. Therefore, we reasonably assigned these two distinct resonances as the methyl resonances of the trans and cis forms of N6 -methylated adenine. In addition, previous NMR studies performed at the mononucleotide level support this resonance assignment. For example, an NMR study of N6 -methylated adenine in CDCl3 solvent showed that the N6 -methyl chemical shifts are 3.07 (cis) and 3.51 (trans) ppm (25Engel J.D. Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4143-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Another study of an N6 -methylated adenine monomer in H2O observed that the methyl resonance is a doublet and that the amino proton resonance is a spin-coupled quartet (26Raszka M. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Trans-cis interconversion of the N6-methylated adenine. A, section of two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC spectrum.

From 0 to 12 °C the separation of the two peaks remained at ∼24 Hz, and the separation decreased to ∼15 Hz for increasing temperatures up to 48 °C. However, even at temperatures above 48 °C the coalescence was not observed. If we assume that the initial separation between these two resonances in the absence of C6 -N6 bond rotation is 24 Hz, the simulated exchange kinetics estimates that the exchange process should occur <10 times per second (s-1) throughout the temperature range that we investigated. This slow exchange is consistent with the NOESY spectra in which many resonances have line widths that are broader than the corresponding resonances of the unmethylated DNA, and a few resonances have two sets of chemical shifts (data not shown).The C-N bond rotation of an adenine amino group in a double-stranded helix has been shown to be 60-24,000 s-1 over temperatures ranging from 0 to 70 °C (27Michalczyk R. Russu I.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2679-2686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the C6 -N6 bond length of N6 -methylated adenine (1.342 Å) (11Sternglanz H. Bugg C.E. Science. 1973; 182: 833-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is nearly identical to that of a normal adenine C6-N6 bond length (1.335 Å), the slow exchange of the N6 -methylated adenine should be explained by structural reasons other than the partial double bond character of the C6-N6 .Overall Structures of Unmethylated and Hemimethylated DNAs—For both unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA, NOE connectivity and sugar puckers (C2′-endo, 3JH1′-H2′ > 8 Hz) typical of B-DNA were observed, and the 31P chemical shifts (∼ -3 ppm) were populated within a small range. However, one deviation from the standard B-DNA structure was that the minor groove width of unmethylated DNA was significantly narrow (Fig. 3A). This structural feature of the GATC site is consistent with the crystal structure of the self-complementary dodecamer DNA duplex, 5′-CGTAGATCTACG-3′ (28Leonard G. Hunter W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), where the spine of hydration is observed in the narrow minor groove.Fig. 3Superimposed overall structures of unmethylated DNA (panel A; 18 structures) and the trans form (panel B; 16 structures) and cis form (panel C; 16 structures) of hemimethylated DNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Trans and Cis Structures of the Hemimethylated GATC Site—Even though the N6 -methylated adenine undergoes a slow interconversion between two distinct isomers, NOESY spectra showed only a single set of cross-peaks, except for a few resonances. Therefore, to explore the small differences between the two isomeric GATC sites, two separate calculations were performed for the trans and cis forms of hemimethylated DNA. For these calculations, most of the same constraints were used, except that hydrogen bonding restraints between A18 and T7 were used for the trans version but not for the cis one. Unlike for the unmethylated DNA, the backbone dihedral angle γ was unconstrained for the hemimethylated DNA (in both the trans and cis structures), because the normal γ (60 ± 30°) angle constraints yielded results that consistently violated other NOE constraints.The structural changes between the trans and cis isomers were not extensive, and backbone dihedrals showed no remarkable differences between the trans and cis isomers. Also, the sugar puckers of hemimethylated DNA were pure C2′-endo and not intermediate between C2′-endo and C3′-endo, implying that the sugar puckers were not altered by the interconversion. The root mean square deviation between the trans and cis isomers was 1.1 ± 0.2 Å, which is slightly larger than the pairwise root mean square deviation values of converged sets of the trans (0.6 ± 0.2 Å) and cis (0.9 ± 0.2 Å) isomers (Table I) The stacking interactions of the GATC site are quite similar for the trans and cis isomers, except that the stacking between A18 and T19 is much stronger in the trans isomer (Fig. 2F). Despite the trans-cis isomerization of the N6 -methylated adenine (A18), the observed NOE between A18H2 and T7 imino was of strong intensity, which is typical of the Watson-Crick A-T base pairs. This NOE constraint was used identically for the trans and cis structures and did not violate other NOE and angle constraints, even in the cis structures. The distance between the A18H2 and the T7 imino in the cis structures was slightly shorter (2.88 ± 0.02 Å) than that in the trans structures (3.14 ± 0.04 Å) (Fig. 2F). This finding suggests that steric clash between the cis form of the N6 -methylated adenine (A18) and the complementary strand's base (T7) is relieved by the shift of the A18 base into the major groove without the complete opening of the base pair.Table IStructure determination statistics for unmethylated and hemimethylated DNAUnmethylatedHemimethylatedCisTransTotal number of NOE distance restraints438409Intra-residue distances10397Sequential residue distances232218Inter-strand distances10394Dihedral restraints (β, γ, δ, ϵ, and χ)11390Base planarity restraints1212Residual dipolar coupling restraints2027Total number of restraints583538Pairwise r.m.s.d for all heavy atoms (Å)ar.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation.0.8 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.20.6 ± 0.2Average NOE violations (Å)0 (>0.5 Å)0 (>0.5 Å)0 (>0.5 Å)Average dihedral angle violations (°)0 (>5°)0 (>5°)0 (>5°)Mean deviation from covalent geometry Bond lengths (Å)0.00180.00180.0018Angles (°)0.40.40.4Impropers (°)0.40.60.5a r.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Characteristic Structural Identities of the Hemimethylated GATC Site in Regard to the Backbone—For hemimethylated DNA, the α/γ angles were correlated as gauche+/gauche- in residues A4, A6, A16, A18, and C20. The γ angle of C8 was trans for trans hemimethylated DNA and spanned the gauche- to trans range for cis hemimethylated DNA. Molecular simulations of a GpC step of a number of DNA crystal structures showed that, in addition to the canonical α/γ angles (gauche-/gauche+), a few metastable sub-states, including α/γ:gauche+/gauche-, exist in DNA-protein complexes and free DNA (29Várnai P. Djuranovic D. Lavery R. Hartmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5398-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This α/γ:gauche+/gauche- sub-state is accompanied by a BI conformation, which is characterized by an ϵ/ζ: trans/gauche- conformation with the (ϵ-ζ) around -90°. The DNA backbones of both the unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA were BI conformations throughout all the residues.Characteristic Structural Identities of the Hemimethylated GATC Site in Regard to Groove Width—The minor groove width measured from P-P distances gets progressively narrower from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the oligomer to the central GATC site of unmethylated DNA (Figs. 3A and 4). However, hemimethylated DNA shows a quite different pattern with respect to the minor groove width. Residues 5′ to the N6 -methylated adenine (A18) have narrower minor groove widths, whereas residues on the 3′ side have wider minor groove widths than those observed for unmethylated DNA, and this is true for both the cis and trans structures (Figs. 3, B and C, and 4). The distances between the adenine H2 (n) and the sequential (n + 1) or inter-strand H1′ (n′ + 1) (n and n′ are complementary residues) are dependent on the local sequence and show a very good correlation with minor groove parameters P-P or H1′-H1′ of DNA (30Chuprina V.P. Lipanov A.A. Fedoroff O.Y. Kim S.-G. Kintanar A. Reid B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9087-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For unmethylated DNA, the NOEs of A18H2-T19H1′, A6H2-T7H1′, A18H2-C8H1′, and A6H2-C20H1′ are of medium-to-weak intensity. However, for hemimethylated DNA, these NOEs are of weak-to-very weak intensity, which is quite consistent with the obtained structures, given that the widened minor groove on the 3′ side of A18 makes these distances longer by ∼1-2 Å.Fig. 4Major and minor groove widths of the converged structures of unmethylated (triangle) and hemimethylated DNAs (cis, open circle; trans, filled circle). Groove widths were calculated by Curves 5.2 (24Lavery, R., and Skelenar, H. (1997) CURVES 5.2, Helical Analysis of Irregular Nucleic Acids, Biochimie Theorique, CNRS URA 77, ParisGoogle Scholar). Error bars indicate S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The major groove width of unmethylated DNA gets wider as one progresses inward from the 5′ and 3′ ends to a maximum of 13.6 ± 0.7 Å at the central A6-T7/A18-T19 base pair step (Fig. 4). However, the major groove width of hemimethylated DNA shows sharply contrasting results. With a minimum (10.1 ± 0.9 Å for the cis and 10.9 ± 0.2 Å for the trans) at the A6-T7/A18-T19 base pair step, the major groove width widens as one progresses outward toward the 5′ and 3′ ends (Fig. 4).This unusual helical feature could be explained partially by the twist angles. Unmethylated DNA shows typical twist angles (35 ± 1°) through the G5-A6/T19-C20 base pair step to the C8-T9/A16-G17 base pair step. However, the T7-C8/G17-A18 base step of hemimethylated DNA is over-twisted (46 ± 2° for the cis and 40 ± 1° for the trans), and the A6-T7/A18-T19 base step is under-twisted (23 ± 2° for the cis and 30 ± 1° for the trans). The wider major groove width expected for the 5′ side, and the narrower major groove width expected for the 3′ side of the A18 residue of hemimethylated DNA might be adapted to the current groove widths by the over-twisted and under-twisted helical distortions.Base Pair Lifetimes of the Hemimethylated GATC Site—We measured the base pair lifetimes of the central A-T base pairs in unmethylated and hemimethylated GATC sites using ammonia as a base catalyst. In the helical state, the T imino protons are protected from exchange with base catalyst, but under a higher concentration of base catalyst an exchange may take place each time a base pair opens. Because the reported lifetimes of typical A-T and G-C base pairs are 0.5-7 and 4-50 ms, respectively (18Guéron M. Leroy J.-L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 261: 383-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), the lifetime we measured for the A6-T19 and A18-T7 base pairs (the T7 and T19 imino resonances became broad and overlapped as the ammonia concentration increased) in an unmethylated GATC site (5.8 ms) is a reasonable value (Fig. 5A). However, the lifetime we measured for these base pairs in a hemimethylated GATC site (20.4 ms) is remarkably longer than expected (Fig. 5A). These findings support previous findings of base pair lifetimes in GATC sites, even though the previously adopted methods differ from ours (15Fazakerley G.V. Quignard E. Téoule R. Guy A. Guschlbauer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Fig. 5Dynamics of hemimethylated GATC site. A, exchange time of the imino proton of T7 (and T19) at pH 8.8, 15 °C. Filled circle, hemimethylated DNA; open circle, unmethylated DNA. B, section of H2O NOESY spectrum (τm = 240 ms). The chemical shift of water resonance is ∼4.8 ppm. C, one-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15NH4Cl in the presence of unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA. The first spectra (12 °C) of both DNAs are scaled to same peak height. Only half of the peak is shown for the first spectrum because of space limitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The longer base pair lifetime of hemimethylated DNA might be caused by the fact that the ammonium ion can bind to the minor groove of DNA and affect base pair kinetics without altering the DNA structure (31Folta-Stongniew E. Russu I.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8439-8449Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, we assessed ammonium ion binding with the use of 1H-15N HSQC of a 15N-labeled ammonium ion (NH4+) in which the 1H-15N correlation peak will be observed only for the ammonium ions that are tightly bound to DNA (32Hud N.V. Schultze P. Feigon J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6403-6404Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is because free bulk ammonium ions in solution experience extensive proton exchange with solvent water molecules. In contrast to the c"

Labeling with [(3)H] nucleosides resulted in growth inhibition by both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Tritium labeling also led to nuclear accumulation of p53 and induction of the p53-regulated gene p21(WAF1) and its encoded protein (p21). ATM-deficient cells, however, did not increase their p53 and p21 protein levels in response to radiolabeling. Thus, labeling of human cells with tritiated nucleosides activates the radiation-responsive, ATM-dependent, DNA-damage surveillance network. Labeling of normal cells with [(3)H]thymidine significantly accelerated the repair of ultraviolet (UV) light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, as monitored by a sensitive immunofluorescence assay. Unlike [(3)H] labeling, [(14)C] labeling did not produce any impact on proliferation, p53 signaling, or DNA repair. In the light of these findings, the validity of results obtained with nucleic acid synthesis and DNA repair assays that involve [(3)H] and [(14)C] labeling is discussed. Our immunofluorescence approach detected pyrimidine dimers after exposure to UV fluences as low as 1 J/m(2) (the lowest fluence examined). This approach may prove particularly useful for monitoring DNA damage and its repair following exposure to extremely low levels of genotoxic agents."

Expression of IRS-3 is restricted mainly to white adipose tissue; expression of this IRS protein is virtually absent in brown adipocytes. We have tested the capacity of IRS-3 to mediate insulin actions in IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes. Thus, we expressed exogenous IRS-3 in immortalized IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes at a level comparable with that of endogenous IRS-3 in white adipose tissue. Under these conditions, IRS-3 signaling in response to insulin was observed, as revealed by tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-3, and the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase associated with this recombinant protein. However, although insulin promoted the association of Grb-2 with recombinant IRS-3 in IRS-1–/– cells, the exogenous expression of this IRS family member failed to activate p42/44 MAPK and mitogenesis in brown adipocytes lacking IRS-1. Downstream of PI 3-kinase, IRS-3 expression restored insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, which is impaired by the lack of IRS-1 signaling. Whereas the generation of IRS-3 signals enhanced adipocyte determination and differentiation-dependent factor 1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein (ADD-1/SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase mRNA and protein expression, activation of this pathway was unable to reconstitute CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and uncoupling protein-1 transactivation and gene expression in response to insulin. Similar results were obtained following insulin-like growth factor-I stimulation. In brown adipocytes expressing the IRS-3F4 mutant, the association of the p85α regulatory subunit via Src homology 2 binding was lost, but insulin nevertheless induced PI 3-kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation in a wortmannin-dependent manner. In contrast, activation of IRS-3F4 signaling failed to restore the induction of ADD-1/SREBP-1c and fatty acid synthase gene expression in IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes. These studies demonstrate that recombinant IRS-3 may reconstitute some, but not all, of the signals required for insulin action in brown adipocytes. Thus, our data further implicate a unique role for IRS-1 in triggering insulin action in brown adipocytes.

Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). UCP-1 uncouples fatty acid oxidation from ATP synthesis, which allows dissipation of energy from substrate oxidation as heat (2Trayhurn P. Milne R.E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1989; 67: 811-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, BAT is a major site for lipid metabolism, using fatty acids as the main fuel to maintain its thermogenic capacity (for review see Ref. 3Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Rodent brown adipocytes differentiate at the end of the fetal life via two programs, an adipogenic program of lipid synthesis and expression of lipogenic enzymes, which generates the multi-locular fat droplets phenotype (4Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M Teruel T. Benito M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem.

Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Regarding thermogenic differentiation, the main pathway involved in the regulation of UCP-1 gene expression is noradrenergic (8Dalgaard L.T. Pedersen O.

However, because the noradrenergic stimulus induced by hypothermia after birth is not yet fully developed in brown adipose tissue during late fetal development (5Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M.

Moreover, during recent years (6Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) our laboratory has found that fetal brown adipocytes display high affinity binding sites for insulin. This classic hormone appears to be the primary mediator of fetal brown adipogenesis based on its ability to induce expression of metabolic genes (6Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); insulin may additionally exert a role in thermogenesis by inducing UCP-1 expression (15Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 176: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that primary fetal brown adipocytes express high levels of both IRS-1 and IRS-2. Interestingly, IRS-1, but not IRS-2, associates with Grb-2 in these cells to trigger ras/MAPK activation, thereby mediating the mitogenic response to insulin. The PI 3-kinase cascade is the main pathway implicated in the expression of both adipogenic- and thermogenic-related genes in primary fetal brown adipocytes (16Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Navarro P. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, ras/MAPK signaling has been shown to down-regulate the UCP-1 gene expression in response to insulin (17Porras A Alvarez A.M. Valladares A. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 825-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently (18Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we have generated immortalized fetal brown adipocyte cell lines from IRS-1 knockout. This cell culture model has enabled us to identify the IRS-mediated signaling pathways responsible for the biological effects of insulin on brown adipose tissue during late fetal development. Thus, in brown adipocyte cell lines displaying the typical multilocular lipid droplets phenotype, IRS-1, but not IRS-2, is essential for insulin-stimulated mitogenesis (19Valverde A.M. Mur C. Pons S. Alvarez A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), lipid synthesis (18Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M.

No information is currently available regarding the role of IRS-3 in the insulin signaling cascades of brown adipocytes.

IRS-3 mediates PI 3-kinase activation rather than Grb-2/ras signaling pathway, suggesting a specific role for IRS-3 in triggering the metabolic rather than the mitogenic actions of insulin (24Xu P.

In the current study, we have addressed the potential of IRS-3 to mediate insulin signaling in brown adipocytes deficient for IRS-1. Our results reveal that expression of recombinant IRS-3 in our brown adipocyte model restores insulin-stimulated Akt activation and fatty acid synthase gene expression but not p42/p44 MAPK activation and UCP-1 gene expression, critical pathways that are impaired in brown adipocytes lacking IRS-1. Thus, these observations further confirm a unique role for IRS-1 in triggering insulin action in brown adipose tissue.

After 4–6 h of incubation, cells were shocked with 3 ml of 15% glycerol for 2 min, washed, and then fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% FCS. 24 h after transfection, hygromycin (200 μg/ml) was added to select stable transfectants. The expression of the IRS-3F4 mutant was assessed by Western blot. Immunoprecipitations—Quiescent cells were treated without or with several doses of insulin as indicated and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.6. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. After protein content determination, equal amounts of protein (500–600 μg) were immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose or anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer and extracted for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Western Blotting—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes and were blocked using 5% non-fat dried milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl pH 7.5, and incubated overnight with several antibodies as indicated in 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting protocol (Amersham Biosciences). PI 3-kinase Activity—PI 3-kinase activity was measured in the anti-IRS-3 or anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates by in vitro phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol as described previously (18Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Protein Determination—Protein determination was performed by the Bradford dye method (25Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were cultured as described under “Results” and in the figure legends. At the end of the culture time, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was isolated as described (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA (10 μg) was submitted to Northern blot analysis, i.e. electrophoresed on 0.9% agarose gels containing 0.66 m formaldehyde, transferred to GeneScreen membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and cross-linked to the membranes by ultraviolet light. Hybridization was performed in 0.25 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 0.25 m NaCl, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 7% SDS, and 50% deionized formamide, containing denatured 32P-labeled cDNA (106 cpm/ml) for 24 h at 42 °C. cDNA labeling was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP by using a multiprimer DNA-labeling system. Blots were hybridized with probes for fatty acid synthase (FAS) (27Amy C.M. Witkowski A. Naggert J. Williams B. Randhawa Z. Smith S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3114-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and for ADD-1/SREBP-1c (28Palmer D.G. Rutter G.A. Tavaré J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Membranes were subjected to autoradiography, and the relative densities of the hybridization signals were determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms. Extraction of Nuclear Proteins—At the end of the culture time, cells were resuspended at 4 °C in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml aprotinin), allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, and then vortexed for 10 s. Samples were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in cold Buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at –70 °C. Isolation of Mitochondrial Protein—Cells were cultured as described under “Results” and in the figure legends. At the end of the culture time, cells were scrapped off in isotonic isolation buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.6), collected by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in hypotonic isolation buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.6). Then, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and homogenized under a Teflon pestle (Overhead Stirrer; Wheaton Instruments, Milville, NJ). Hypertonic isolation buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 450 mm sucrose, pH 7.6) was added to balance the tonicity of the buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets, containing the mitochondrial fraction, were resuspended in isotonic isolation buffer, and mitochondrial protein content was determined. CAT Assays—Cells growing in the presence of 10% FCS were transiently transfected according to the calcium phosphate-mediated protocol as described previously (15Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell Physiol. 1998; 176: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs used were UCP-1-CAT (where the CAT reporter gene is under the control of a 4551-bp full-length 5′ flanking region of the UCP-1 promoter) (29Cassard-Doulcier A-M. Gelly C. Fox N. Schrementi J. Raimbault S. Klaus S. Forest C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and pCMV β-galactosidase (gal) (a viral promoter driving expression of the reporter gene β-gal). Ten micrograms of DNA-CAT, together with 2 μg of DNA-β-gal (to monitor transfection efficiency), were added to each 10-cm dish. After 4 h of incubation, cells were fed with serum-free medium for 15 h and stimulated with various doses of insulin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) for a further 24 h. Then, cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared for CAT and β-gal activity assays. CAT activity was determined by incubating 70 μl of cell extracts with 0.25 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol and 0.5 mm acetyl coenzyme A in 0.25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, at 37 °C for 15 h, and then samples were submitted to thin layer chromatography. The amount of substrate acetylated was directly quantified with a radioimaging device (Fujifilm BAS-1000). CAT enzyme activity was expressed in arbitrary units normalized to the internal control β-gal (assayed according to the Stratagene protocol). Transfections were performed in duplicate from three independent experiments. Determination of [3H]Thymidine Incorporation into Acid-insoluble Material—DNA synthesis was determined after 24 h of cell culture in the absence or presence of various doses of insulin by [3H]thymidine incorporation (0.2 μCi/ml) into acid-insoluble material over the last 4 h of culture (19Valverde A.M. Mur C. Pons S. Alvarez A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as disintegrations per min/dish. Expression of IRS-3 and Its Tyrosine Phosphorylation in IRS-1-deficient Brown Adipocytes—Previous experiments performed in IRS-1-deficient fetal brown adipocytes revealed an essential role of IRS-1 in mediating insulin-induced lipid synthesis (18Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and UCP-1 expression (20Valverde A.M. Arribas M. Mur C. Navarro P. Pons S. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10221-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), IRS-2 being unable to compensate these responses. IRS-3 is a member of IRS family mainly expressed in white adipose cells (21Lavan B.E. Lane W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11439-11443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). IRS-3 expression is virtually absent in BAT extracts, as shown in the Western blot depicted in Fig. 1A. To investigate a possible role of IRS-3 in triggering insulin actions in IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes, we overexpressed IRS-3 in immortalized IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes by retroviral gene transfer. By using this approach, we generated immortalized fetal brown adipocyte IRS-1-deficient cell lines expressing similar IRS-3 levels than those found in white adipose tissue extracts (see Fig. 1A). Our next step was to investigate whether overexpressed IRS-3 in IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation. Confluent immortalized brown adipocytes (wild-type, IRS-1–/–, IRS-1–/–(+IRS-3)) were serum-deprived for 20 h and then stimulated with insulin (10–100 nm) for 5 min. Total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-3 antibody and submitted to Western blot analysis with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, insulin induced a marked increased in IRS-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes overexpressing IRS-3, no tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-3 being detected either in immortalized wild-type or IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes. Insulin Induced the Association of IRS-3 with p85a and Activated PI 3-kinase in IRS-1-deficient Brown Adipocytes— IRS-3 contains phosphotyrosine residues in a consensus sequence for binding to p85α regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase following insulin stimulation (23Zhou L. Chen H. Xu P. Cong L.-N. Sciacchitano S. Li Y. Graham D. Jacobs A.R. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 505-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether overexpressed IRS-3 associated p85α in immortalized IRS-1–/–(+IRS-3) fetal brown adipocytes. Serum-deprived cells were further stimulated with insulin (10–100 nm) for 5 min. Total protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-3 antibody and submitted to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with anti-p85α antibody. In the representative experiment shown in Fig. 2A, we did not detect association of p85α with IRS-3 in wild-type brown adipocytes stimulated with insulin. Surprisingly, insulin stimulation of IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes resulted in a slight increase in p85α associated to IRS-3, despite of the absence of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-3 in these cells (see Fig. 1B). As expected, overexpressed IRS-3 in IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes associated p85α in parallel to the levels of its tyrosine phosphorylation. Next, we checked whether IRS-3 was able to activate PI 3-kinase in brown adipocytes. Cells were stimulated as described above, and PI 3-kinase activity was measured in anti-IRS-3 immune complexes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2B (left panel), IRS-3-associated PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity in parallel to IRS-3/p85α association. Although no IRS-3-associated PI 3-kinase activity was detected in wild-type cells, in IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes insulin slightly induced IRS-3-associated PI 3-kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner, this effect being much higher when IRS-3 was overexpressed in these cells. Our laboratory has reported recently (18Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Valverde A.M. Arribas M. Mur C. Navarro P. Pons S. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10221-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that the lack of IRS-1 resulted in a 30% decrease in total (anti-Tyr(P)-associated) PI 3-kinase activity in insulin-stimulated brown adipocytes. To test whether IRS-3 can replace IRS-1 in stimulating total PI 3-kinase activity in fetal brown adipocytes, cells were treated with insulin (10–100 nm) for 5 min and further assayed for PI 3-kinase enzymatic activity in anti-Tyr(P) immune complexes. Fig. 2B (right panel) showed that IRS-3 expression in IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes turned out in a recovery of total PI 3-kinase activity, this effect being truly significant at 100 nm insulin concentration. IRS-3 Expression Restored the Insulin Effect on Akt Phosphorylation, but Not MAPK Activation, in IRS-1 – / – Brown Adipocytes—In fetal brown adipocytes, the lack of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity cannot be compensated by IRS-2 and results in a failure of insulin to stimulate downstream targets such as Akt phosphorylation (18Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Valverde A.M. Arribas M. Mur C. Navarro P. Pons S. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10221-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fact that IRS-3 binds to and activates PI 3-kinase in IRS-1–/– cells prompted us to investigate a possible mechanism of recovery of the insulin response in activating Akt in the absence of IRS-1. Cells were stimulated with various doses of insulin and subsequently lysed. AktSer-473 phosphorylation was determined by direct Western blot analysis in wild-type, IRS-1–/–, and IRS-1–/–(+IRS-3) cells (Fig. 3A). In fetal brown adipocytes, the lack of IRS-1 resulted in a loss of AktSer-473 phosphorylation; only a remnant AktSer-473 phosphorylation was detected at 100 nm insulin concentration. The exogenous expression of IRS-3 in IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes resulted in a total recovery of AktSer-473 phosphorylation in response to insulin. It has been extensively reported that the association of IRS proteins with Grb-2 results in the activation of MAPK (30Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A.G. Vicentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R.J. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown recently (19Valverde A.M. Mur C. Pons S. Alvarez A. White M.F. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that in brown adipocytes the effect of insulin on MAPK activation is IRS-1-dependent. Accordingly, we investigated whether IRS-3 led to activation of MAPK in brown adipocytes. First, we checked IRS-3/Grb-2 association in IRS-1–/– brown adipocytes expres"
https://openalex.org/W2053069569,"The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) encoded by the Epstein–Barr virus functions as a constitutively activated receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. LMP1 is a short-lived protein that is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. We have previously shown that LMP1 recruits the adapter protein tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) to lipid rafts. To test if TRAFs are involved in LMP1's ubiquitination, we have mutated the LMP1 CTAR1 site that has been identified as a TRAF binding site. We show that the CTAR1 mutant (CTAR1−) is expressed after transfection at a similar level to wild-type LMP1, and behaves as wild-type LMP1 with respect to membrane localization. However, CTAR1− does not bind TRAF3. We demonstrate that ubiquitination of CTAR1− is significantly reduced when compared to wild-type LMP1. In addition, the expression of wild-type LMP1 induces the ubiquitination, an effect that is significantly reduced when the CTAR1− is expressed. Taken together, our results suggest that TRAF proteins are involved in the ubiquitination of LMP1, and that their binding to LMP1 may facilitate their own ubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2091182027,"Cross-talk between signaling pathways plays an important role in regulation of cell growth, differentiation, survival, and death. Here, we show that Akt regulates the Elk-1 transcription factor, independent of its negative regulation of Raf kinases. Using a constitutively active Mek1 to bypass the regulation of Raf by Akt, we find that the Elk-1 and Sap1a proteins are dramatically decreased in the presence of activated Akt. Akt catalytic activity is required. Also, Mek-dependent activation of a TCF (Elk-1/Sap-1a)-dependent c-fos reporter is decreased by activated Akt. Neither the level of Elk-1 mRNA nor the stability of the Elk-1 protein is altered by activated Akt. Instead, the rate of incorporation of labeled methionine into Elk-1 protein is decreased in the presence of Akt. In addition, the level of the Elk-1 protein but not GFP is significantly decreased in the presence of activated Akt, when GFP is expressed from an IRES element in a bicistronic message with Elk-1. We conclude that Akt negatively regulates translation of the Elk-1 mRNA. A coding region determinant that maps within the first 279 nts of the Elk-1 message is necessary and sufficient for Akt-mediated regulation of Elk-1."
