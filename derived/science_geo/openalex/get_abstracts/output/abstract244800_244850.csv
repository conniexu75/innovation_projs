Conventional measurements based on leaf dimensions are invariably laborious and often only approximate. Other methods aimed at increasing the speed and accuracy of the measurements, such as photoelectric techniques6,7, are only really applicable to broad leaved species. For microphyllous and needle leaved species the only reliable method so far has been to calculate the surface areas of selected leaf samples from measurements of length and circumference, then to extrapolate the values to whole shoots on the basis of leaf numbers or fresh weights5,8. Doronichev9 has attempted to simplify the measurements for conifer shoots by determining the adsorption of rnethylene blue from aqueous solutions on the assumption that a monomolecular layer is formed on the surface and that each mg methylene blue adsorbed corresponds to a surface area of 1.05 m2. For most plant shoots, however, the change in methylene blue concentration is far too small to be accurately measured using standard photo-densitometers."

https://openalex.org/W1982347164,"THE purpose of this note is to call attention to the fact that usual methods of measuring soil pH1 seriously underestimate the pH of very acid soils, such as those of coal mine spoils2, cat clays3 and solfataras4, in which acidity is due to the presence of free sulphuric acid. Standard methods for measuring soil pH involve making a slurry of soil with (usually) distilled water at a 1 : 2, 1 : 5, or 1 : 10 dilution, and reading the pH of this slurry. Implicit in this procedure is the assumption that the soil is buffered and hence that pH does not change with dilution. This assumption is erroneous in the case of the sulphuric acid soils."

We have therefore begun an exhaustive compilation of present and past measures of extinction at as many observatories throughout the world as possible. I wish to point out one of the most important results so far, the measurement of a large secular decrease in the transmission of the atmosphere measured at a significant altitude above the Los Angeles Basin."
