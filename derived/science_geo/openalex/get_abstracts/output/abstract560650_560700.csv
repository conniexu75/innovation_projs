Here, we combine in vivo and in vitro studies, together with computational modeling, to show that subcompartments within the nucleolus represent distinct, coexisting liquid phases.

These results suggest that phase separation can give rise to multilayered liquids that may facilitate sequential RNA processing reactions in a variety of RNP bodies. The cellular interior is organized into organelles whose structures have evolved to facilitate their functions. The most well-known examples are the canonical membrane-bound organelles such as secretory vesicles, the Golgi apparatus, and the endoplasmic reticulum. However, many intracellular compartments are membrane-less bodies comprised of RNA and protein, often referred to as RNP bodies; these include stress granules and processing bodies in the cytoplasm and Cajal bodies and nucleoli in the nucleus, among many others. Despite their lack of a delimiting membrane, these organelles nevertheless maintain a coherent size and shape, with a well-defined boundary that compartmentalizes different types of proteins and RNA. By concentrating molecules within a micro-compartment, while allowing dynamic molecular interactions, these RNP bodies may function to control reaction efficiencies much like conventional membrane bound cytoplasmic organelles (Balagopal and Parker, 2009Balagopal V.

Nuclear domains.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2891-2893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these RNP bodies exhibit liquid-like biophysical properties, and growing evidence suggests they assemble via liquid-liquid phase separation (Brangwynne et al., 2009Brangwynne C.P.

Intracellular phase transitions can result in switch-like changes in molecular organization and the spontaneous formation of micron-scale membrane-less organelles. Such behavior is reminiscent of well-known in vitro observations in protein crystallization, where soluble proteins are observed to condense into concentrated liquid phases or crystalline solid phases. A number of recent papers suggest that intrinsically disordered proteins or low complexity sequences (IDP/LCS) drive phase transitions underlying assembly of the nucleolus (Berry et al., 2015Berry J.

Cell Biol. 2015; 210: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The liquid-like nature of the nucleolus may facilitate its function in ribosome biogenesis. The nucleolus forms around regions of chromosomes containing stretches of tandem rDNA gene repeats, known as nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). In most eukaryotes (including human, Xenopus laevis, and Caenorhabditis elegans), a precursor rRNA transcript is generated from the rDNA gene and contains each of the co-transcribed 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNA subunits, separated by two intervening transcribed sequences (Figure 1A). The nucleolus may facilitate increased reaction rates by locally concentrating rRNA processing factors involved in transforming the precursor rRNA transcript into individual rRNA subunits. Due to its role in producing this protein translational machinery, the structure and function of the nucleolus are intimately connected with cell growth and size homeostasis (Derenzini et al., 2000Derenzini M.

Despite the biological importance of the nucleolus, a mechanistic biophysical understanding of its assembly and internal organization is lacking. The simplest picture of the nucleolus as a unitary liquid phase body becomes difficult to reconcile with its well-known complex and multi-component nature. Indeed, in addition to the various types of RNA in the nucleolus, the nucleolar proteome consists of hundreds of different proteins that are segregated into at least three distinct compartments (Boisvert et al., 2007Boisvert F.-M. van Koningsbruggen S. Navascués J. Lamond A.I. The multifunctional nucleolus.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 574-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). This layered tripartite organization consists of the fibrillar center (FC), where the RNA polymerase I (POL1) machinery is active; the dense fibrillar component (DFC) that is enriched in the protein fibrillarin (FIB1); and the granular component (GC) that is enriched in the protein nucleophosmin (NPM1/B23) (Figures 1A and 1B). This multi-layered structure is not unique to the nucleolus, as stress granules and other liquid-like RNP bodies exhibit similar “core-shell” structuring (Jain et al., 2016Jain S. Wheeler J.R. Walters R.W. Agrawal A. Barsic A. Parker R. ATPase-modulated stress granules contain a diverse proteome and substructure.Cell. 2016; 164: 487-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, Hubstenberger et al., 2013Hubstenberger A.

Cell. 2013; 27: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The multi-layered structure of the nucleolus is thought to facilitate assembly line processing of rRNA. Nascent rRNA transcripts undergo sequential processing steps by enzymes that localize to the distinct compartments, ultimately exiting the nucleolus and being exported for final ribosome assembly in the cytoplasm (Figure 1A). Although recent work has shown that the entire nucleolus can exhibit active liquid-like properties (Brangwynne et al., 2011Brangwynne C.P. Mitchison T.J. Hyman A.A. Active liquid-like behavior of nucleoli determines their size and shape in Xenopus laevis oocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 4334-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) and its assembly may represent a type of liquid-liquid phase transition (Weber and Brangwynne, 2015Weber S.C. Brangwynne C.P. Inverse size scaling of the nucleolus by a concentration-dependent phase transition.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 641-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), reconciliation of these findings with the multi-layered structure of the nucleolus has proven elusive. Indeed, if the nucleolus is a type of liquid, what mechanism prevents the three components from mixing and fusing to form a single liquid phase? Here, we uncover a physical mechanism for intranucleolar organization: differences in miscibility between proteins from different nucleolar compartments keep the compartments phase separated, giving rise to the layered, multiphase droplet nature of nucleoli. By isolating protein domains from key nucleolar proteins, we provide evidence for a molecular mechanism whereby intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) help drive protein condensation into droplets, while associated RNA binding domains confer subcompartment specificity by making the two droplet phases immiscible with one another. To gain insight into the biophysical assembly principles underlying nucleolar structure, we took advantage of the numerous large nucleoli, ranging in size from one to ten microns, found in the nucleus (germinal vesicle [GV]) of X. laevis oocytes (Figure 1B). This system is also convenient because the nucleoli are extra-chromosomal, forming around amplified stretches of rDNA, allowing us to disentangle the confounding effects of somatic chromosome architecture on nucleolar structure. Nucleoli in X. laevis oocytes will fuse with one another when brought into contact (Brangwynne et al., 2011Brangwynne C.P. Mitchison T.J. Hyman A.A. Active liquid-like behavior of nucleoli determines their size and shape in Xenopus laevis oocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 4334-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), but the frequency of such coalescence events is slowed significantly by the presence of a nuclear actin network (Figures S1A–S1D) (Feric and Brangwynne, 2013Feric M. Brangwynne C.P. A nuclear F-actin scaffold stabilizes ribonucleoprotein droplets against gravity in large cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2013; 15: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Feric et al., 2015Feric M. Broedersz C.P. Brangwynne C.P. Soft viscoelastic properties of nuclear actin age oocytes due to gravitational creep.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 16607Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We visualized intranucleolar organization by labeling individual components of nucleoli with fluorescent fusion proteins as follows: granular component with nucleophosmin (GC, NPM1::Cerulean), dense fibrillar component with fibrillarin (DFC, FIB1::RFP), and the fibrillar center with RNA polymerase 1E (FC, GFP::POLR1E). To test the role of nuclear actin in organizing these nucleolar substructures, we utilized the actin-disrupting compound Latrunculin-A (Lat-A). As shown previously, the entire nucleolus undergoes liquid-like coalescence events, which can be seen by fusion of the NPM1 (GC) region of one nucleolus with the NPM1 (GC) region from another nucleolus (Figures 1D–1G; Movies S1, S2, and S3). The FC regions (POLR1E) rarely came into close contact with each other, and consequently, we did not observe fusion between multiple FCs, but we did see rearrangements into more spherical FC domains. Strikingly, however, we typically observe that the FIB1 (DFC) cores from one nucleolus will fuse when in close proximity with FIB1 (DFC) cores from a different nucleolus (Figures 1D–1G and S1E–S1L). These DFC regions, which were initially irregular in shape, would round up and coalesce, exhibiting classic liquid-like behavior. After long times (∼1 hr), these coalescence events ultimately resulted in DFCs located in the center of the nucleolus, surrounded by one continuous phase of GC, representing an outer-most enveloping compartment (Figure 1C). To gain insight into the biophysical properties of different nucleolar subcompartments, we quantitatively analyzed fusion events. We found that homotypic fusion between the GC (NPM1) or DFC (FIB1) occurs by exponential relaxation to a single larger spherical shape; this is characteristic of coalescing liquid droplets and can be used to determine the ratio of droplet viscosity, η, to surface tension, γ, known as the inverse capillary velocity: η/γ (Brangwynne et al., 2011Brangwynne C.P. Mitchison T.J. Hyman A.A. Active liquid-like behavior of nucleoli determines their size and shape in Xenopus laevis oocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 4334-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) (Figure 1H). We find that FIB1-labeled DFC tends to exhibit slower fusion dynamics, with a larger value η/γ = 80 ± 15 s/μm (mean ± SEM) compared to NPM1-labeled GC with η/γ = 30 ± 5 s/μm (mean ± SEM) (Figures 1H, inset, S1M, and S1N). This behavior suggests that these nucleolar components behave as distinct liquid-like phases within the nucleolus, with different properties that could underlie nucleolar structural organization. Interfaces represent sharp concentration gradients and surface tension, with units of energy per unit area, is the energetic cost of increasing the interfacial area. Surface tension is a key parameter that governs how two different droplets interact with one another. We therefore hypothesized that different surface tension values of the nucleolar sub-phases could explain their immiscibility and multi-layered organization. To measure the surface tension of the outermost GC compartment (i.e., interfacial energy of GC/nucleoplasm interface), we disrupted actin and allowed nucleoli to fuse for several hours. This resulted in a single large coalesced nucleolar droplet, which becomes measurably flattened at the bottom of the nucleus due to gravity. Because this flattening is resisted by surface tension, we could use a right-angle prism to measure the (XZ) shape of the droplet and determine the surface tension: 4± 1 × 10−7 N/m (mean ± SEM) (Figures 1J and 1K; Supplemental Experimental Procedures); this value is very low, roughly five orders of magnitude lower than water-oil surface tension values (Than et al., 1988Than P. Preziosi L. Josephl D. Arney M. Measurement of interfacial tension between immiscible liquids with the spinning road tensiometer.J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1988; 124: 552-559Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but is comparable to values reported for colloidal liquids (Aarts et al., 2004Aarts D.G. Schmidt M. Lekkerkerker H.N. Direct visual observation of thermal capillary waves.Science. 2004; 304: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Complementary measurements of the droplet flattening timescale combined with droplet fusion measurements are consistent with this low value for the surface tension of the NPM1-rich GC compartment (Figure 1L; Movie S4; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To confirm the liquid-like dynamics of the nucleolar subcompartments, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments of X. laevis nucleoli in vivo (Figure 1I). NPM1 exhibits fast dynamics with a nearly complete recovery on a timescale of τ = 64 ± 8 s for a bleach spot of 1 μm, consistent with the expected response for diffusion within a liquid. However, FIB1 recovery was slightly slower (τ = 75 ± 7 s). Moreover, the recovery of FIB1 was not complete, but only reached ∼80%; this suggests that the DFC subcompartment may not be a simple liquid, but instead may exhibit partially solid-like properties (i.e., viscoelasticity). To gain further insight into how nucleolar proteins could give rise to distinct liquid-like nucleolar sub-phases, we purified recombinant FIB1 and NPM1 and studied their behavior in vitro. Consistent with our previous work, we find that FIB1::GFP (hereafter referred to simply as FIB1) can phase separate in vitro under near physiological protein and salt concentrations (Berry et al., 2015Berry J. Weber S.C. Vaidya N. Haataja M. Brangwynne C.P. RNA transcription modulates phase transition-driven nuclear body assembly.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E5237-E5245Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), giving rise to condensed liquid-phase droplets that are ∼50-fold more concentrated with protein than the surrounding dilute phase (Figure 2A). Indeed, in the presence of 5 μg/ml rRNA and 150 mM NaCl, FIB1 condenses into droplets at a protein concentration of ∼600 nM. FIB1 can phase separate even in the presence of non-specific poly-U50 and heparin, suggesting that electrostatic interactions contribute to droplet assembly (Figure S2A). NPM1 has also recently been demonstrated to undergo phase separation into liquid-like droplets (Figure 2B) (Mitrea et al., 2016Mitrea D.M. Cika J.A. Guy C.S. Ban D. Banerjee P.R. Stanley C.B. Nourse A. Deniz A.A. Kriwacki R.W. Nucleophosmin integrates within the nucleolus via multi-modal interactions with proteins displaying R-rich linear motifs and rRNA.eLife. 2016; 5: e13571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at 150 mM NaCl, NPM1 requires significantly higher concentrations of protein (2 μM) and rRNA (100 μg/ml). Moreover, phase separation of NPM1 required rRNA and cannot be induced by the addition of heparin or poly-U50.Figure S2Purified Nucleolar Proteins Can Phase Separate into Droplets with Different Biophysical Properties, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) In vitro FIB1 droplets in the presence of 5 μg/ml rRNA (left), or 0.1 mg/ml heparin (middle), or 5 μM poly-U50 (right).

FIB1 phase separates into non-liquid, “aggregate-like” structures in the absence of RNA. Given the distinct biophysical properties of the nucleolar subcompartments, we hypothesized that the two different types of in vitro droplets would also exhibit different material properties. As with the in vivo subcompartments, in vitro droplets undergo homotypic fusion events when brought into close contact, but do so with markedly different timescales: FIB1 droplets typically take roughly a hundred times longer than NPM1 droplets of comparable size to coalesce and relax into a single larger sphere (Figure 2C). Using an analysis similar to that performed in vivo, we find that FIB1 has an inverse capillary velocity of η/γ = 40 ± 10 s/μm (95% confidence interval), comparable to that measured in vivo (Figure S2C). Also mirroring the in vivo data, purified NPM1 droplets have a lower value of 0.30 ± 0.07 s/μm (Figures 2D and S2C). A series of experiments confirmed that the presence of the GFP tag does affect droplet properties, but does not qualitatively impact our findings (Figures S2B and S2C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). NPM1 readily formed large droplets in vitro, allowing for direct measurement of the surface tension, using a method similar to our in vivo set up with the prism (Figure 1J). We estimated a surface tension of γNPM1 = 8 ± 2 × 10−7 N/m (mean ± SEM) (Figure S2D). This value is again surprisingly low and on the same order of magnitude as the value obtained for X. laevis nucleoli (Figure S2C). To further shed light on the different properties of the two droplet subtypes, we performed microrheology experiments using the fluctuating motion of probe particles (R = 50 nm) (Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015Elbaum-Garfinkle S. Kim Y. Szczepaniak K. Chen C.C.-H. Eckmann C.R. Myong S. Brangwynne C.P. The disordered P granule protein LAF-1 drives phase separation into droplets with tunable viscosity and dynamics.Proc. Natl.

Gladfelter A.S. RNA controls PolyQ protein phase transitions.Mol. Cell. 2015; 60: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). These data reveal that NPM1 droplets exhibit a diffusive exponent of α = 0.92 ± 0.06, (Figure 2E, red symbols), consistent with that of a simple viscous liquid for which α = 1. We can thus calculate a viscosity of NPM1 droplets, η = 0.74 ± 0.06 Pa-s, which is several hundred times more viscous than water (Figure S2C). By contrast, probe particle motion in FIB1 droplets is significantly reduced (Figure 2E, green symbols), in agreement with the slowed coalescence dynamics observed with FIB1 droplets. Interestingly, FIB1 droplet microrheology reveals a sub-diffusive exponent (α = 0.5 ± 0.1), which implies that these are not simple viscous liquid droplets, but are instead viscoelastic. To determine how FIB1 droplet viscoelasticity may arise, we performed FRAP experiments on phase-separated in vitro droplets (Figure 3). After 30 min of initiating phase separation, we find that NPM1 has near complete recovery (84% ± 3%) on very short timescales, with a recovery constant of τ = 23 ± 1 s (Figures 3A and S3C); this is consistent with the purely viscous microrheology results, as well as the nearly complete NPM1 FRAP recovery in vivo. By contrast FIB1 has low recovery (37% ± 2%) with a timescale of τ = 56 ± 5 s (Figures 3B and S3C). Such incomplete FRAP recovery is expected for a viscoelastic material, since not all molecules exhibit dynamic, fluid-like exchange. Moreover, this in vitro FIB1 behavior agrees well with the incomplete FIB1 FRAP recovery in vivo, in both cultured mammalian cells expressing FIB::GFP and amphibian nucleoli (Figure 3F).Figure S3Nucleolar Protein Droplets Exhibit Liquid-like Dynamics, but FIB1 Shows Evidence for Aging, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) In vitro FIB1::GFP droplets at 30 min and 2 hr.(B) The left plot is FRAP recovery curves for FIB1::GFP droplets at 30 min (closed circles) and 2 hr (closed squares) after phase separation was initiated.

https://openalex.org/W2403475582,"Colorectal tumor is a heterogeneous disease, with varying clinical presentation and prognosis in patients. To establish a platform encompassing this diversity, we generated 55 colorectal tumor organoid lines from a range of histological subtypes and clinical stages, including rare subtypes. Each line was defined by gene expression signatures and optimized for organoid culture according to niche factor requirements. In vitro and in xenografts, the organoids reproduced the histopathological grade and differentiation capacity of their parental tumors. Notably, we found that niche-independent growth is predominantly associated with the adenoma-carcinoma transition reflecting accumulation of multiple mutations. For matched pairs of primary and metastatic organoids, which had similar genetic profiles and niche factor requirements, the metastasis-derived organoids exhibited higher metastatic capacity. These observations underscore the importance of genotype-phenotype analyses at a single-patient level and the value of our resource to provide insights into colorectal tumorigenesis and patient-centered therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2395416306,"Prolonged wakefulness leads to an increased pressure for sleep, but how this homeostatic drive is generated and subsequently persists is unclear. Here, from a neural circuit screen in Drosophila, we identify a subset of ellipsoid body (EB) neurons whose activation generates sleep drive. Patch-clamp analysis indicates these EB neurons are highly sensitive to sleep loss, switching from spiking to burst-firing modes. Functional imaging and translational profiling experiments reveal that elevated sleep need triggers reversible increases in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, NMDA receptor expression, and structural markers of synaptic strength, suggesting these EB neurons undergo “sleep-need”-dependent plasticity. Strikingly, the synaptic plasticity of these EB neurons is both necessary and sufficient for generating sleep drive, indicating that sleep pressure is encoded by plastic changes within this circuit. These studies define an integrator circuit for sleep homeostasis and provide a mechanism explaining the generation and persistence of sleep drive."
https://openalex.org/W2395764428,"Plant roots can regenerate after excision of their tip, including the stem cell niche. To determine which developmental program mediates such repair, we applied a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that multiple cell types can reconstitute stem cells, demonstrating the latent potential of untreated plant cells. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembles that of an embryonic root progenitor. Regeneration defects are more severe in embryonic than in adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirror their embryonic dynamics and manipulation of both hormones alters the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant root regeneration follows, on a larger scale, the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information provided by complementary hormone domains."
https://openalex.org/W2404664646,"•Aversive learning reduces odor-specific feed-forward inhibition in mushroom body•Feed-forward inhibition selectively inhibits avoidance-directing neural pathways•Appetitive motivation increases feed-forward inhibition in the mushroom body•Imposing feed-forward inhibition favors appetitive memory expression In Drosophila, negatively reinforcing dopaminergic neurons also provide the inhibitory control of satiety over appetitive memory expression. Here we show that aversive learning causes a persistent depression of the conditioned odor drive to two downstream feed-forward inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the mushroom body, called MVP2, or mushroom body output neuron (MBON)-γ1pedc>α/β. However, MVP2 neuron output is only essential for expression of short-term aversive memory. Stimulating MVP2 neurons preferentially inhibits the odor-evoked activity of avoidance-directing MBONs and odor-driven avoidance behavior, whereas their inhibition enhances odor avoidance. In contrast, odor-evoked activity of MVP2 neurons is elevated in hungry flies, and their feed-forward inhibition is required for expression of appetitive memory at all times. Moreover, imposing MVP2 activity promotes inappropriate appetitive memory expression in food-satiated flies. Aversive learning and appetitive motivation therefore toggle alternate modes of a common feed-forward inhibitory MVP2 pathway to promote conditioned odor avoidance or approach.

Learning and internal states guide appropriate behavior by altering the properties of neural circuits. A great number of studies across phyla have elucidated brain structures and cellular mechanisms that underlie these changes, but we still know relatively little about how experience and states are implemented in the functional connectivity of a neural network. Inhibition across a range of timescales from milliseconds to days, mediated by neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and a variety of neuropeptides, is emerging as a critical and general operating principle of neural circuit function and behavioral control (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P.

Fast inhibition can spatially and temporally refine neural representations of sensory stimuli so that specificity is maintained and windows of time in which neural integration can take place are established (Gabernet et al., 2005Gabernet L.

Somatosensory integration controlled by dynamic thalamocortical feed-forward inhibition.Neuron. 2005; 48: 315-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition, fast and persistent inhibition can alter neural excitability and the efficacy of synaptic transmission and thereby re-route the flow of information through circuits (Vogels and Abbott, 2005Vogels T.P.

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that control, and the circumstances in which, the level of inhibition is altered in the nervous system. The reduced numerical complexity of the Drosophila brain permits an understanding of these mechanisms at cellular resolution. Studies in flies, mice, and primates have established that dopaminergic neurons (DANs) play a critical role in reinforcement and motivation (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R.

Input-specific control of reward and aversion in the ventral tegmental area.Nature. 2012; 491: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). However, it is currently unclear how the processes of reinforcement relate to those of motivational salience. Olfactory learning in Drosophila could provide an inroad. Flies assign negative and positive values to odors in aversive and reward based paradigms (Tully and Quinn, 1985Tully T. Quinn W.G. Classical conditioning and retention in normal and mutant Drosophila melanogaster.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav. Physiol. 1985; 157: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, Tempel et al., 1983Tempel B.L. Bonini N. Dawson D.R. Quinn W.G. Reward learning in normal and mutant Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1983; 80: 1482-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). When subsequently tested for odor preference, they either avoid or approach the conditioned odor. Individual odors are uniquely represented as activity in relatively sparse subpopulations of the ∼2,000 intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs) per hemisphere of the mushroom body (MB), providing cellular specificity to odor memories (Honegger et al., 2011Honegger K.S. Campbell R.A. Turner G.C. Cellular-resolution population imaging reveals robust sparse coding in the Drosophila mushroom body.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11772-11785Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). During learning, odor-activated KCs receive coincident reinforcing input from combinations of positively or negatively reinforcing DANs (Waddell, 2013Waddell S. Reinforcement signalling in Drosophila; dopamine does it all after all.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Stimuli such as sweet taste, nutrient value, and water activate distinct populations of rewarding DANs in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster, which innervate different zones on the horizontal lobes of the MB (Burke et al., 2012Burke C.J. Huetteroth W. Owald D. Perisse E. Krashes M.J. Das G. Gohl D. Silies M. Certel S. Waddell S.

Reward quality therefore seems to be represented in different DANs, and memories of these rewarding stimuli are presumably formed within the relevant orthogonal zones along the odor-activated KC arbor (Owald and Waddell, 2015Owald D.

Biol. 2014; 24: 1712-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that aversive memory lacks quality information and might simply represent the magnitude of aversion. Interestingly, studies suggest that negatively reinforcing MP1 DANs also mediate hunger-dependent motivational control over appetitive memory expression (Krashes et al., 2009Krashes M.J. DasGupta S. Vreede A. White B. Armstrong J.D. Waddell S.

Reinforcement signalling in Drosophila; dopamine does it all after all.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2013; 23: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this context, MP1 DANs appear to be inhibitory since blocking them releases inappropriate memory expression in food-satiated flies (Krashes et al., 2009Krashes M.J. DasGupta S. Vreede A. White B. Armstrong J.D. Waddell S. A neural circuit mechanism integrating motivational state with memory expression in Drosophila.Cell. 2009; 139: 416-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Moreover, MP1 DANs are themselves controlled by peptidergic inhibition—dNPF, the fly equivalent of NPY—demonstrating that behavior can be controlled through a hierarchical layering of inhibitory pathways. Each of the 15 discrete MB zones that is defined by the innervation of a particular type of DAN has a corresponding set of MB output neurons (MBONs) (Aso et al., 2014aAso Y. Hattori D. Yu Y. Johnston R.M. Iyer N.A. Ngo T.T. Dionne H. Abbott L.F. Axel R. Tanimoto H. Rubin G.M. The neuronal architecture of the mushroom body provides a logic for associative learning.eLife. 2014; 3: e04577Google Scholar), suggesting that DANs specifically modulate the efficacy of the KC-MBON connection within a zone (Owald and Waddell, 2015Owald D. Waddell S. Olfactory learning skews mushroom body output pathways to steer behavioral choice in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 35: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent work has revealed a clear model for how DAN reinforcement during learning can shape odor-driven behavior (Owald et al., 2015Owald D. Felsenberg J. Talbot C.B. Das G. Perisse E. Huetteroth W. Waddell S. Activity of defined mushroom body output neurons underlies learned olfactory behavior in Drosophila.Neuron. 2015; 86: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Owald and Waddell, 2015Owald D. Waddell S. Olfactory learning skews mushroom body output pathways to steer behavioral choice in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 35: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Reward learning engages DANs that modulate and suppress the conditioned odor-drive from KCs to glutamatergic MBONs that intrinsically direct avoidance behavior (Owald et al., 2015Owald D. Felsenberg J. Talbot C.B. Das G. Perisse E. Huetteroth W. Waddell S. Activity of defined mushroom body output neurons underlies learned olfactory behavior in Drosophila.Neuron. 2015; 86: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In contrast, aversive learning enhances conditioned odor-drive to these avoidance MBONs (Owald et al., 2015Owald D. Felsenberg J. Talbot C.B. Das G. Perisse E. Huetteroth W. Waddell S. Activity of defined mushroom body output neurons underlies learned olfactory behavior in Drosophila.Neuron. 2015; 86: 417-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, Bouzaiane et al., 2015Bouzaiane E.

Plaçais P.Y. Aso Y. Siwanowicz I. Trannoy S. Thoma V. Tedjakumala S.R. Rubin G.M. Tchénio P. Ito K. et al.Mushroom body efferent neurons responsible for aversive olfactory memory retrieval in Drosophila.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and perhaps GABAergic, MBONs driving approach. Learning and internal states are therefore likely to tune collections of MBON pathways to skew the overall MBON network toward either directing approach or aversion (Owald and Waddell, 2015Owald D. Waddell S. Olfactory learning skews mushroom body output pathways to steer behavioral choice in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2015; 35: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The presynaptic terminals of MP1/PPL1-γ1pedc DANs are intermingled with the dendrites of MVP2 neurons (also called MBON-γ1pedc>α/β; Aso et al., 2014bAso Y. Sitaraman D. Ichinose T. Kaun K.R. Vogt K. Belliart-Guérin G. Plaçais P.Y. Robie A.A. Yamagata N. Schnaitmann C. et al.Mushroom body output neurons encode valence and guide memory-based action selection in Drosophila.eLife. 2014; 3: e04580Google Scholar), consistent with these DANs modifying the KC-MVP2 junction (Owald and Waddell, 2015Owald D.

Artificial activation of MP1 paired with odor presentation was recently reported to induce an odor-specific depression at this site (Hige et al., 2015Hige T. Aso Y. Modi M.N. Rubin G.M. Turner G.C. Heterosynaptic Plasticity Underlies Aversive Olfactory Learning in Drosophila.Neuron. 2015; 88: 985-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Here we show that aversive learning causes a persistent and specific reduction in the relative conditioned odor drive to MVP2, yet MVP2 output is only required for the expression of short-term aversive memory. Anatomical and functional connectivity suggests that MVP2 exert asymmetric feed-forward inhibition over MBONs on the horizontal and vertical MB lobes, preferentially promoting approach by inhibiting avoidance directing pathways. Consistent with this model, hunger generally increases MVP2 odor-driven responses, and MVP2-dependent inhibition is required for the expression of appetitive memory at all times in hungry flies. Moreover, activation of MVP2 neurons promotes the expression of appetitive memory in food-satiated flies. Aversive learning and appetitive motivation therefore differentially modulate the odor-drive of the MVP2 neurons, which alters feed-forward inhibition onto other MBON pathways within the neural network of the MB. Reduced feed-forward inhibition is required for conditioned avoidance, whereas increased feed-forward inhibition promotes expression of conditioned approach. We used the R83A12-GAL4 (Jenett et al., 2012Jenett A. Rubin G.M. Ngo T.T. Shepherd D. Murphy C. Dionne H. Pfeiffer B.D. Cavallaro A. Hall D.

This remarkable plasticity and capacity for memory places macrophages as key therapeutic targets for treatment of inflammatory disorders. Traditionally, the innate immune system has been distinguished from the adaptive system by its marked lack of immunological memory (Roitt et al., 2006Roitt I.M. Delves P. Martin S. Burton D. Roitt’s essential immunology. Wiley-Blackwell, 2006Google Scholar). While innate (phagocyte-mediated) responses were considered to be the rapid and non-adaptable “first line of defense” against tissue damage and infection, the ability to mount highly specific and adaptable responses had been restricted to the lymphocyte-mediated adaptive system. However, there is now increasing evidence that cells of the innate immune system can become reprogrammed to develop immunological memory of previous encounters (Netea et al., 2011Netea M.G.

The development of such innate memory is of clear importance to those organisms that lack an adaptive immune system (such as plants and invertebrates), which can provide valuable resistance to secondary infections in the absence of lymphocyte-mediated responses (Durrant and Dong, 2004Durrant W.E. Dong X. Systemic acquired resistance.Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 185-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar, Pham et al., 2007Pham L.N. Dionne M.S. Shirasu-Hiza M. Schneider D.S.

However, innate immune memory also provides important protection in mammalian systems, where it functions in parallel with classical B and T cell-dependent adaptive responses. Indeed, mice lacking functional T and B cells can develop cross-protection against secondary bacterial and fungal infections based on innate immune training alone (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J. Quintin J. Preijers F. Joosten L.A. Ifrim D.C. Saeed S. Jacobs C. van Loenhout J. de Jong D.

Monocytes, macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as the main innate immune cells responsible for this priming phenomenon and appear to undergo a profound phenotypic reprogramming upon exposure to microbial stimuli that changes their response to secondary infection (Bowdish et al., 2007Bowdish D.M.E.

Macrophage receptors implicated in the “adaptive” form of innate immunity.Microbes Infect. 2007; 9: 1680-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Until now, research in this field has primarily focused on the innate training that occurs in response to primary infection and the mechanisms by which this confers resistance to secondary microbial attack—a process that has been termed “trained immunity” (Bistoni et al., 1986Bistoni F.

Immunol. 1989; 124: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, innate immune cells, such as macrophages, are multifunctional cells that not only fight infection, but also perform a range of additional key roles in health and disease. These include the phagocytosis and clearance of dying apoptotic cells, the removal of necrotic cells within damaged tissue, the deposition and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM), and the surveillance of abnormal (e.g., cancer) cells (Murray and Wynn, 2011Murray P.J. Wynn T.A. Protective and pathogenic functions of macrophage subsets.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, Wood and Jacinto, 2007Wood W. Jacinto A. Drosophila melanogaster embryonic haemocytes: masters of multitasking.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 542-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that macrophages might also become “trained” and develop immunological memory in response to these other stimuli. The concept of macrophages as multifunctional cells raises the possibility that exposure to each individual stimulus could reprogram the macrophage so that is responds differently to subsequent stimuli. It is well documented that macrophages display remarkable phenotypic plasticity and can acquire specialized functional phenotypes (often described as M1/M2) in response to a variety of different environmental cytokines and pathogens, giving rise to a spectrum of different macrophage subsets that play diverse roles during host defense, wound repair, and tissue homeostasis (Martinez and Gordon, 2014Martinez F.O.

Edwards J.P. Exploring the full spectrum of macrophage activation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 958-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar). One of the key functions of macrophages in vivo is the clearance of dying apoptotic cells, both during normal development/tissue homeostasis (Jacobson et al., 1997Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

Although apoptosis was traditionally considered to be “immunologically neutral” (Meagher et al., 1992Meagher L.C. Savill J.S. Baker A. Fuller R.W. Haslett C. Phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils does not induce macrophage release of thromboxane B2.J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 52: 269-273PubMed Google Scholar, Stern et al., 1996Stern M. Savill J. Haslett C.

Pathol. 1996; 149: 911-921PubMed Google Scholar), more recent studies have suggested it may have powerful immunological effects, being both pro or anti-inflammatory depending on context (Savill et al., 2002Savill J. Dransfield I. Gregory C. Haslett C. A blast from the past: clearance of apoptotic cells regulates immune responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Determining the exact mechanism by which apoptosis affects macrophage behavior in vivo requires a genetically tractable model in which it is possible to precisely manipulate different macrophage stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways. Here, the Drosophila embryo serves as an ideal system, which has been used extensively to model the innate inflammatory response to tissue damage and infection (Evans et al., 2015Evans I.R. Rodrigues F.S.L.M. Armitage E.L. Wood W. Draper/CED-1 mediates an ancient damage response to control inflammatory blood cell migration in vivo.Curr.

Drosophila embryos as model systems for monitoring bacterial infection in real time.PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000518Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We exploit the optical translucency of the Drosophila embryo to observe macrophage priming in real time in vivo using high-resolution time-lapse imaging. In this study, we exploit the natural apoptotic cell death that occurs during Drosophila development to investigate the role of corpse uptake on the response of macrophages to tissue damage and infection in vivo. We find that corpse phagocytosis is an essential step to prime macrophages for a robust inflammatory recruitment to wounds and uptake of bacteria. We go on to dissect the molecular mechanism by which these immune cells build this memory and show that corpse uptake triggers rapid intracellular calcium bursts within the macrophage, that together with elevated JNK activity and expression of the CED-1 homolog Draper, are required for the macrophage priming effect. Naive macrophages, from H99 mutants that lack programmed cell death, are unresponsive to wounds and bacterial invasion, but these defects can be rescued by uptake of UV-induced apoptotic corpses or ectopic activation of Draper expression. We conclude that apoptotic corpses generate a molecular memory within macrophages that has a subsequent pro-inflammatory effect on macrophage behavior that could function in vivo to boost the innate inflammatory response at inflamed sites associated with extensive apoptotic cell death. During embryogenesis, Drosophila macrophages (hemocytes) migrate from their origin in the head mesoderm, along highly stereotypical routes posteriorly along the ventral nerve cord (VNC; Figure 1A) (Tepass et al., 1994Tepass U. Fessler L.I. Aziz A. Hartenstein V. Embryonic origin of hemocytes and their relationship to cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this time, significant numbers of apoptotic cells are generated during the developmental sculpting of tissues, including neurons within the VNC, and these are rapidly phagocytosed by the migrating macrophages (Movie S1; Figures 1B–1G) (Franc et al., 1999Franc N.C.

Embryonic origin of hemocytes and their relationship to cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages initially migrate along the midline of the VNC, guided by local PDGF/VEGF (Pvf) guidance cues expressed along the route of migration (Cho et al., 2002Cho N.K. Keyes L. Johnson E. Heller J. Ryner L. Karim F.

Faria C. Jacinto A. Distinct mechanisms regulate hemocyte chemotaxis during development and wound healing in Drosophila melanogaster.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The leading “pioneer” cells rarely leave the midline as they migrate posteriorly and predominantly phagocytose apoptotic corpses in their near vicinity (Figure 1D; Movie S1), but occasionally they extend long cytoplasmic arms (“pseudopods”) that contact and engulf outlying apoptotic corpses that are positioned more laterally (up to 40 μm from the midline) (Figure 1E; Movie S1). These pseudopods are rapidly retracted back into the cell body, delivering the apoptotic corpse to the cell for degradation. In contrast, macrophages positioned further back in the migrating cluster are less spatially constrained (Evans et al., 2010Evans I.R. Hu N. Skaer H. Wood W. Interdependence of macrophage migration and ventral nerve cord development in Drosophila embryos.Development. 2010; 137: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and migrate laterally out from the midline in response to an apoptotic corpse (arrow, Figure 1B). These macrophages move directly toward the dying cells (Figure 1F; Movie S1), returning back to the midline once engulfment is complete, and only rarely extend the long pseudopods characteristic of the leading cells. The relative contributions of each uptake strategy for the two different populations are depicted in Figure 1G. The differences in uptake strategy most likely reflect early spatial constraints within the developing embryo; macrophages migrate in the extracellular space between the overlying epithelium and underlying VNC, and this space develops in a strict anterior to posterior fashion (Evans et al., 2010Evans I.R. Hu N. Skaer H. Wood W. Interdependence of macrophage migration and ventral nerve cord development in Drosophila embryos.Development. 2010; 137: 1625-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Individual macrophages progressively phagocytose large numbers of apoptotic corpses that accumulate in the cytoplasm as large vacuoles (inset, Figure 1H). Quantification of corpse uptake reveals that over 80% of macrophages have engulfed and contain at least four corpses by stage 14 (Figure 1I). At this stage, macrophages have completed their developmental migrations and reached the three rows characteristic of mature embryos (Figure 1H). The original populations of “leading” and “trailing” macrophages have become interspersed along the rows. Corpses can be detected by immunostaining for cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 1J). In order to visualize apoptotic cells in living embryos, we expressed the fluorescent caspase sensor Apoliner (Bardet et al., 2008Bardet P.-L. Kolahgar G. Mynett A. Miguel-Aliaga I. Briscoe J. Meier P. Vincent J.-P. A fluorescent reporter of caspase activity for live imaging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13901-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) ubiquitously throughout the embryo (Figure 1K). The Apoliner sensor comprises mRFP and eGFP fluorophores, separated by a specific caspase cleavage site, and is normally retained at the cell surface through a mCD8 transmembrane domain. Upon caspase activation, the sensor is cleaved and eGFP translocates to the nucleus. Using this approach, GFP-positive apoptotic nuclei were observed within macrophages in living embryos (arrowheads, Figure 1K). To establish whether apoptotic corpse engulfment influences a macrophage’s ability to respond to tissue damage, we generated embryos that completely lacked apoptosis (Figure 2). We utilized a chromosomal deletion (deficiency Df(3)H99) that removes the three genes head-involution-defective (hid), reaper (rpr), and grim (grm) that control developmental programmed cell death in Drosophila (Chen et al., 1996Chen P.

Cell killing by the Drosophila gene reaper.Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In their absence, the normal regimen of programmed cell death does not occur, resulting in embryos that completely lack apoptosis (White et al., 1994White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Genetic control of programmed cell death in Drosophila.Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The “naive” macrophages have no opportunity to engulf apoptotic corpses and so lack the large intracellular vacuoles (phagocytosed corpses) characteristic of wild-type cells (cf. Figure 2A with Figure 2G; Movie S2). Despite the lack of apoptosis in the developing nerve cord (and other tissues), macrophage specification and developmental dispersal along the VNC appears indistinguishable from wild-type (Figure 2B). Macrophages are present in normal numbers (Figure S1A), migrate laterally at speeds similar to wild-type (Figure S1B), and exhibit normal contact inhibition of locomotion (Davis et al., 2012Davis J.R. Huang C.-Y. Zanet J. Harrison S. Rosten E. Cox S. Soong D.Y. Dunn G.A. Stramer B.M. Emergence of embryonic pattern through contact inhibition of locomotion.Development. 2012; 139: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), reaching the stereotypical three-row arrangement by stage 14 (Figure 2C). Apoptotic corpse clearance therefore seems not to be required for early macrophage development or migration (Cho et al., 2002Cho N.K. Keyes L. Johnson E. Heller J. Ryner L. Karim F. Krasnow M.A. Developmental control of blood cell migration by the Drosophila VEGF pathway.Cell. 2002; 108: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). However, when H99 mutant embryos were wounded the normal inflammatory response of macrophages was completely blocked such that naive H99 macrophages failed to accumulate at the wound site and continued with contact-inhibition migration stereotypical of unwounded embryos (compare Figures 2D–2D′′ with control Figures 2F–2F′′, quantified in Figure 2E; Movie S3), despite normal production of the pro-inflammatory wound attractant H2O2 (Figures 2I and 2J) (Moreira et al., 2010Moreira S.

Biol. 2010; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, Niethammer et al., 2009Niethammer P. Grabher C. Look A.T. Mitchison T.J. A tissue-scale gradient of hydrogen peroxide mediates rapid wound detection in zebrafish.Nature. 2009; 459: 996-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Although H99 macrophages are not attracted over long distances toward the damaged tissue, those macrophages in the immediate vicinity of the wound are seen to phagocytose necrotic wound debris (arrowheads, Figure 2H), indicating that they are not impaired in their ability to detect or phagocytose damaged, dying cells. Taken together, these data suggest that macrophages generate a molecular memory of their encounter with an apoptotic corpse, and that uptake of these corpses may be an essential pre-requisite for macrophage detection of tissue damage in vivo. An alternative explanation for the impaired inflammatory recruitment of macrophages in H99 mutants is that apoptotic corpses at wild-type wounds are a key attractant contributing to macrophage inflammatory chemotaxis. However, this cannot be the case, because apoptosis could not be detected in the damaged epithelium following wounding by CC3 immunostaining (Figures 2K–2L′), Apoliner imaging (Figures S1C–S1D′), or Acridine Orange staining (Figures S1E–S1F′). CC3 positive corpses were observed within macrophages at the wound site (arrowheads, Figures 2L and 2L′), but they are also found outside of the wound (outlines, Figure 2K; also arrows, Figure S1E) and likely reflect corpses engulfed during prior developmental dispersal; indeed 100% of macrophages contain at least one apoptotic corpse in unwounded embryos by this stage (Figures 1H–1K). To further confirm that apoptotic cell death at the wound site does not play a role in macrophage recruitment, we analyzed the inflammatory wound response following inhibition of apoptosis within the wounded epithelium (Figures S1G and S1H).

Li P. et al.Inhibition of ICE family proteases by baculovirus antiapoptotic protein p35.Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, Hay et al., 1994Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Expression of baculovirus P35 prevents cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) throughout the epithelium did not affect macrophage recruitment to wounds (Figures S1G and S1H). Given that caspases have been implicated in playing a role in cell motility that is unrelated to apoptosis (Geisbrecht and Montell, 2004Geisbrecht E.R. Montell D.J. A role for Drosophila IAP1-mediated caspase inhibition in Rac-dependent cell migration.Cell. 2004; 118: 111-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we tested whether caspase activity is required within macrophages for their wound recruitment (Figures S1I and S1J). However, macrophage-specific expression of p35 (Bump et al., 1995Bump N.J. Hackett M. Hugunin M. Seshagiri S. Brady K. Chen P. Ferenz C. Franklin S. Ghayur T. Li P. et al.Inhibition of ICE family proteases by baculovirus antiapoptotic protein p35.Science. 1995; 269: 1885-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, Hay et al., 1994Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Expression of baculovirus P35 prevents cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) had no effect on inflammatory wound recruitment, macrophage numbers, or migration speed (Figures S1I and S1J; data not shown). To determine whether macrophages are primed by performing phagocytosis per se or specifically require uptake of apoptotic corpses, we tested whether engulfment of fluorescent beads (of approximately the same size as a corpse) could artificially prime naive H99 macrophages (Figures 3A–3G). Both wild-type (Figures 3A and 3A′) and naive H99 macrophages (Figures 3C and 3C′) readily phagocytose fluorescent beads injected into the hemolymph. Bead uptake did not, however, rescue the inflammatory wound recruitment defect of naive H99 macrophages (Figures 3D–3D′′, 3E, and low magnification in 3G) nor did it affect the recruitment of wild-type macrophages to wounds (Figures 3B–3B′′, 3E, and low magnification in 3F). These data suggest that macrophage priming by phagocytosis is specific to the uptake of apoptotic corpses. To test this, we attempted to prime naive H99 macrophages in vivo by stimulating apoptotic corpse uptake (Figures 3H–3M). Apoptosis can be experimentally induced in individual cells in vivo by a focused pulse of 405 nm (UV) laser illumination (Figures 3H–3H′′) (Moreira et al., 2010Moreira S. Stramer B. Evans I. Wood W. Martin P. Prioritization of competing damage and developmental signals by migrating macrophages in the Drosophila embryo.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Following UV exposure, the targeted epithelial cell is rapidly extruded from the surrounding epithelium by a contractile actin cable (insets, Figures 3H and 3H′) and the cell delaminates basally into the interior of the embryo (inset, Figure 3H′′). The dying cell is rapidly detected by nearby macrophages that engulf the cell as it delaminates from the epithelium (Figures 3H–3H′′). UV induces apoptosis in H99 embryos despite the absence of the upstream rpr, hid, and grim genes (Figures 3I and 3J) (White et al., 1994White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Genetic control of programmed cell death in Drosophila.Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). In this way, apoptotic corpses could be generated and observed within H99 macrophages by CC3 staining both during (Figure 3I) and after engulfment (Figure 3J). To attempt to rescue macrophage priming, multiple apoptosis events were triggered in H99 mutants to ensure that the majority of naive H99 macrophages had engulfed at least one apoptotic corpse (Figure 3K). Strikingly, this approach successfully rescued macrophage recruitment to tissue damage, when the wounds were made 90 min post-corpse induction (Figures 3L–3L′′ and 3M). This rescue was not observed for wounds made only 30 min following corpse uptake (Figure 3M), suggesting that apoptosis-induced macrophage priming requires more than 30 min post-phagocytosis to alter cell behavior. Intracellular calcium signaling has been linked to apoptotic corpse uptake in worms, flies, and mammals (Cuttell et al., 2008Cuttell L. Vaughan A. Silva E. Escaron C.J. Lavine M. Van Goethem E.

https://openalex.org/W2407256950,"Replacement of mitochondria through nuclear transfer between oocytes of two different women has emerged recently as a strategy for preventing inheritance of mtDNA diseases. Although experiments in human oocytes have shown effective replacement, the consequences of small amounts of mtDNA carryover have not been studied sufficiently. Using human mitochondrial replacement stem cell lines, we show that, even though the low levels of heteroplasmy introduced into human oocytes by mitochondrial carryover during nuclear transfer often vanish, they can sometimes instead result in mtDNA genotypic drift and reversion to the original genotype. Comparison of cells with identical oocyte-derived nuclear DNA but different mtDNA shows that either mtDNA genotype is compatible with the nucleus and that drift is independent of mitochondrial function. Thus, although functional replacement of the mitochondrial genome is possible, even low levels of heteroplasmy can affect the stability of the mtDNA genotype and compromise the efficacy of mitochondrial replacement."

They describe abnormal metabolites accumulating because of deficient NANS enzyme activity and show that impaired sialic acid synthesis in zebrafish perturbs skeletal development, which can partially be rescued by supplementation with exogenous sialic acid. We identified biallelic mutations in NANS, the gene encoding the synthase for N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc; sialic acid), in nine individuals with infantile-onset severe developmental delay and skeletal dysplasia. Patient body fluids showed an elevation in N-acetyl-D-mannosamine levels, and patient-derived fibroblasts had reduced NANS activity and were unable to incorporate sialic acid precursors into sialylated glycoproteins. Knockdown of nansa in zebrafish embryos resulted in abnormal skeletal development, and exogenously added sialic acid partially rescued the skeletal phenotype. Thus, NANS-mediated synthesis of sialic acid is required for early brain development and skeletal growth. Normal sialylation of plasma proteins was observed in spite of NANS deficiency. Exploration of endogenous synthesis, nutritional absorption, and rescue pathways for sialic acid in different tissues and developmental phases is warranted to design therapeutic strategies to counteract NANS deficiency and to shed light on sialic acid metabolism and its implications for human nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2406096232,"Maintaining homeostasis of Ca(2+) stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for proper Ca(2+) signaling and key cellular functions. The Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel is responsible for Ca(2+) influx and refilling after store depletion, but how cells cope with excess Ca(2+) when ER stores are overloaded is unclear. We show that TMCO1 is an ER transmembrane protein that actively prevents Ca(2+) stores from overfilling, acting as what we term a ""Ca(2+) load-activated Ca(2+) channel"" or ""CLAC"" channel. TMCO1 undergoes reversible homotetramerization in response to ER Ca(2+) overloading and disassembly upon Ca(2+) depletion and forms a Ca(2+)-selective ion channel on giant liposomes. TMCO1 knockout mice reproduce the main clinical features of human cerebrofaciothoracic (CFT) dysplasia spectrum, a developmental disorder linked to TMCO1 dysfunction, and exhibit severe mishandling of ER Ca(2+) in cells. Our findings indicate that TMCO1 provides a protective mechanism to prevent overfilling of ER stores with Ca(2+) ions."
https://openalex.org/W2402793322,"Bivalent promoters in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) carry methylation marks on two lysine residues, K4 and K27, in histone3 (H3). K4me2/3 is generally considered to promote transcription, and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) places K27me3, which is erased at lineage-restricted genes when ESCs differentiate in culture. Molecular defects in various PRC2 null adult tissues lack a unifying explanation. We found that epigenomes in adult mouse intestine and other self-renewing tissues show fewer and distinct bivalent promoters compared to ESCs. Groups of tissue-specific genes that carry bivalent marks are repressed, despite the presence of promoter H3K4me2/3. These are the predominant genes de-repressed in PRC2-deficient adult cells, where aberrant expression is proportional to the H3K4me2/3 levels observed at their promoters in wild-type cells. Thus, in adult animals, PRC2 specifically represses genes with acquired, tissue-restricted promoter bivalency. These findings provide new insights into specificity in chromatin-based gene regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2400936627,"Cachexia is a devastating syndrome that causes morbidity and mortality in a large number of patients with cancer. However, the mechanisms of cancer cachexia remain poorly understood. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes stress. The ER responds to this stress through activating certain pathways commonly known as the unfolding protein response (UPR). The main function of UPR is to restore homeostasis, but excessive or prolonged activation of UPR can lead to pathologic conditions. In this study, we examined the role of ER stress and UPR in regulation of skeletal muscle mass in naïve conditions and during cancer cachexia. Our results demonstrate that multiple markers of ER stress are highly activated in skeletal muscle of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and ApcMin/+ mouse models of cancer cachexia. Treatment of mice with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a chemical chaperon and a potent inhibitor of ER stress, significantly reduced skeletal muscle strength and mass in both control and LLC-bearing mice. Blocking the UPR also increased the proportion of fast-type fibers in soleus muscle of both control and LLC-bearing mice. Inhibition of UPR reduced the activity of Akt/mTOR pathway and increased the expression of the components of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and autophagy in LLC-bearing mice. Moreover, we found that the inhibition of UPR causes severe atrophy in cultured myotubes. Our study provides initial evidence that ER stress and UPR pathways are essential for maintaining skeletal muscle mass and strength and for protection against cancer cachexia.—Bohnert, K.

https://openalex.org/W2394559295,"Cytoplasmic dynein, the major motor driving retrograde axonal transport, must be actively localized to axon terminals. This localization is critical as dynein powers essential retrograde trafficking events required for neuronal survival, such as neurotrophic signaling. Here, we demonstrate that the outward transport of dynein from soma to axon terminal is driven by direct interactions with the anterograde motor kinesin-1. In developing neurons, we find that dynein dynamically cycles between neurites, following kinesin-1 and accumulating in the nascent axon coincident with axon specification. In established axons, dynein is constantly transported down the axon at slow axonal transport speeds; inhibition of the kinesin-1-dynein interaction effectively blocks this process. In vitro and live-imaging assays to investigate the underlying mechanism lead us to propose a new model for the slow axonal transport of cytosolic cargos, based on short-lived direct interactions of cargo with a highly processive anterograde motor.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIyOWYxMWI3YTNlMWEwODZiZGQ0OWEwNjQ3ZWJmZjRjYyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc5MzIyNzgzfQ.dPPaRUIrQM112YOJTJ3PHGPpLymeMzIbebKiEFsSnB67ocddX7H0I4JaMB2hQ4OCDT0nGjGJTGWdqw9pIxlUTZzKgwvqcu1mBdA62_UVItZANNWmvnCqiPxBXDkY5Il3s95uKkudDXePAq161A5d0HdvlvKUE-mgN7F0MvZWfMDoIM30aVyie9TQWK8bnTKV96wTwEhjFDWdqw2grxzdVQQs8fIJFBdAqWoTCmTlu0_QZ3DmfFt6G5IQHVfv3_TFUc7XYZ6_Kl8QOoaCntjutMuL_dayw_FSbRSnB4HYHcby75P7qjUcAFE5VzdJ8oE5wTsaOAQuJ_jtm-aYUHASzw(mp4, (20.09 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2397625098,"We have previously demonstrated that crosstalk between lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) facilitates breast cancer proliferation. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that expression of HDAC5 and LSD1 proteins were positively correlated in human breast cancer cell lines and tissue specimens of primary breast tumors. Protein expression of HDAC5 and LSD1 was significantly increased in primary breast cancer specimens in comparison with matched-normal adjacent tissues. Using HDAC5 deletion mutants and co-immunoprecipitation studies, we showed that HDAC5 physically interacted with the LSD1 complex through its domain containing nuclear localization sequence and phosphorylation sites. Although the in vitro acetylation assays revealed that HDAC5 decreased LSD1 protein acetylation, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated HDAC5 knockdown did not alter the acetylation level of LSD1 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Overexpression of HDAC5 stabilized LSD1 protein and decreased the nuclear level of H3K4me1/me2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas loss of HDAC5 by siRNA diminished LSD1 protein stability and demethylation activity. We further demonstrated that HDAC5 promoted the protein stability of USP28, a bona fide deubiquitinase of LSD1. Overexpression of USP28 largely reversed HDAC5-KD-induced LSD1 protein degradation, suggesting a role of HDAC5 as a positive regulator of LSD1 through upregulation of USP28 protein. Depletion of HDAC5 by shRNA hindered cellular proliferation, induced G1 cell cycle arrest, and attenuated migration and colony formation of breast cancer cells. A rescue study showed that increased growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by HDAC5 overexpression was reversed by concurrent LSD1 depletion, indicating that tumor-promoting activity of HDAC5 is an LSD1 dependent function. Moreover, overexpression of HDAC5 accelerated cellular proliferation and promoted acridine mutagen ICR191-induced transformation of MCF10A cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HDAC5 is critical in regulating LSD1 protein stability through post-translational modification, and the HDAC5-LSD1 axis has an important role in promoting breast cancer development and progression."

The oncogenic MUC1-C protein is aberrantly overexpressed in diverse carcinomas; however, there is no known link between MUC1-C and DNA methylation. Our results demonstrate that MUC1-C induces the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, but not DNMT3a, in breast and other carcinoma cell types. We show that MUC1-C occupies the DNMT1 and DNMT3b promoters in complexes with NF-κB p65 and drives DNMT1 and DNMT3b transcription. In this way, MUC1-C controls global DNA methylation as determined by analysis of LINE-1 repeat elements. The results further demonstrate that targeting MUC1-C downregulates DNA methylation of the CDH1 tumor suppressor gene in association with induction of E-cadherin expression. These findings provide compelling evidence that MUC1-C is of functional importance to induction of DNMT1 and DNMT3b and, in turn, changes in DNA methylation patterns in cancer cells."

Unusually a bipartite isolate of the begomovirus Tomato leaf curl virus was identified in CLCuD-affected cotton recently. In the study described here we isolated the bipartite begomovirus Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) from CLCuD-affected cotton. To assess the frequency and geographic occurrence of ToLCNDV in cotton, CLCuD-symptomatic cotton plants were collected from across the Punjab and Sindh provinces between 2013 and 2015. Analysis of the plants by diagnostic PCR showed the presence of CLCuKoV-Bur in all 31 plants examined and ToLCNDV in 20 of the samples. Additionally, a quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the levels of the two viruses in co-infected plants suggests that coinfection of ToLCNDV with the CLCuKoV-Bur/CLCuMB complex leads to an increase in the levels of CLCuMB, which encodes the major pathogenicity (symptom) determinant of the complex. The significance of these results are discussed."

Indeed, ChAT interneurons in the NAc appear to play a role in certain forms of learning, including formation of cocaine-context associations (Witten et al., 2010Witten I.B. Lin S.-C. Brodsky M.

Despite the importance of ChAT interneurons, several key questions remain unaddressed. First, what, if any, synaptic plasticity in the NAc underlies ChAT-interneuron-mediated changes in behavior? Second, if ChAT interneurons do affect synaptic plasticity, under what conditions do they do so? One possibility is that ChAT interneuron activity is by itself sufficient to generate plasticity and to drive reinforcement. Alternatively, the activity of ChAT interneurons could instead function to modulate the extent of plasticity and learning for external reinforcers, without itself being reinforcing. Distinguishing between these possibilities is at the heart of characterizing how these neurons contribute to circuit function and behavior. We address these questions in the context of mice undergoing extinction of a cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). We focused on extinction learning because a critical feature of drug addiction is the persistence of maladaptive drug-seeking behavior, and thus a particular challenge in treating addiction is to find ways to reduce or extinguish drug-related associations. Therefore, mechanisms underlying extinction learning have the potential to be clinically relevant, yet less is known about mechanisms of extinction in comparison to formation of a drug-context association. We examine extinction of a cocaine CPP rather than operant cocaine self-administration in order to specifically isolate mechanisms underlying contextual associations from other types of associations (e.g., operant associations, cue associations). This is a valuable approach given that contextual associations contribute to drug seeking and depend on different neural mechanisms than operant or cue associations (Torregrossa et al., 2013Torregrossa M.M. Gordon J. Taylor J.R. Double dissociation between the anterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens core in encoding the context versus the content of pavlovian cocaine cue extinction.J.

Thus, our first objective was to determine if ChAT interneurons do in fact play a role in extinction learning for a cocaine CPP, a finding which would extend our previous observation that they play a role in formation of such associations (Witten et al., 2010Witten I.B. Lin S.-C. Brodsky M. Prakash R. Diester I. Anikeeva P. Gradinaru V. Ramakrishnan C. Deisseroth K. Cholinergic interneurons control local circuit activity and cocaine conditioning.Science. 2010; 330: 1677-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). We then proceeded to combine in vivo manipulation of ChAT interneuron activity with ex vivo electrophysiology in order to connect ChAT interneuron activity with potential synaptic plasticity mechanisms. We first sought to determine if activity in ChAT interneurons contributes to extinction learning of a cocaine-associated context. Toward this end, an AAV2/5 virus expressing either Cre-dependent ChR2-YFP or YFP only (control virus) was injected into the medial NAc of ChAT::IRES-Cre mice, and optical fibers were implanted bilaterally above the structure (Figures 1A and 1B ). This strategy resulted in selective ChR2 expression in ChAT interneurons of the medial NAc (Figures 1B and 1C). Before proceeding to in vivo experiments, the efficacy of optogenetic stimulation of ChAT interneurons was confirmed through whole-cell recordings in brain slices (Figure 1D; 4–6 weeks after virus injection, 445 nm light, 5 mW/mm2, 15 Hz, 5 ms pulse duration, 2 s activation period interleaved with 2 s light off period). To probe the function of ChAT interneurons in cocaine-context extinction learning, mice were conditioned on a cocaine CPP (paradigm schematic in Figure 1E). During the first day of training (“Pre-test”), mice had access to both chambers of the apparatus. The following 2 days were conditioning days, during which they were trained to associate one environment with cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p. [intraperitoneally]) and the other environment with an equal volume of saline. Mice then underwent 3 extinction days to assess and extinguish their preference for the cocaine chamber: “Test 1” and “Test 2” took place on the 2 days subsequent to conditioning while “Test 3” took place a week later. During only Test 1, mice received bilateral optogenetic activation of the ChAT interneurons as they explored the apparatus (activation was not contingent on the location of the mice in the chamber). Mice that received optogenetic activation of ChAT interneurons during Test 1 spent less time in the cocaine-associated chamber relative to YFP-control littermates across the three post-conditioning test sessions (Figures 1F and 1G; F(2,34) = 10.31, p = 0.0003 for test day and F(1,17) = 5.141, p = 0.037 for group, repeated-measures ANOVA). Of note, the modulation of extinction behavior by ChAT interneurons generalizes beyond the specific mouse strain used in this experiment (strain C57BL/6J; Figure 1G), as we replicated this result in a separate cohort of mice with a different genetic background (strain 129S1; Figures S1A and S1B, available online; F(2,26) = 10.15, p = 0.0005 for test day and F(1,13) = 5.28, p = 0.039 for group, repeated-measures ANOVA). The fact that the difference in preference persisted between the ChR2 and YFP groups during the second and third extinction test, even though ChAT activity was only manipulated on the first test day, suggests that ChAT interneurons affect drug-context extinction learning (rather than simply affecting the expression of the memory; p = 0.021 for group, repeated-measures ANOVA with group and day as factors, analyzing test days 2 and 3 from cohorts in Figures 1G and S1B). In addition, we examined the temporal evolution of chamber preference during the first extinction test, when ChAT interneurons were activated (Figure S1C). Over the course of the session, control mice do not show a significant decrease in chamber preference over time (p = 0.38 for time as a predictor of preference in a linear regression), while mice that received ChAT interneuron activation do show a significant decrease (p = 0.002 for time as a predictor of preference in a linear regression). Although this is suggestive that the time course of extinction is different even during the first test across the two groups, the interaction between group and time is not quite significant with the available data (p = 0.001 for time, p < 0.001 for group, p = 0.081 for time × group; linear regression to predict preference based on group, time, and group × time). ChAT interneurons may contribute to cocaine-context extinction either by modulating ongoing learning, or by generating new learning. To determine if activity in ChAT interneurons is sufficient to generate reinforcement learning in naive mice, we activated ChAT interneurons in a real-time CPP test in which the neurons were activated whenever a mouse was in one chamber and not the other chamber (“Real-time CPP”; Figure 1H). This manipulation had no effect on the time spent in the two chambers, indicating the activity in ChAT interneurons by itself does not drive reinforcement (Figure 1H; p = 0.53, two-tailed t test; additional stimulation frequencies in Figure S1D). We also tested if ChAT interneuron activation could support intracranial self-stimulation in an operant chamber and again did not find that the manipulation was reinforcing (Figure S1E). Given that activation of ChAT interneurons was sufficient to increase extinction learning (Figure 1G), we next investigated the possibility that inhibition of the same neurons would result in the reverse effect of reducing extinction learning. Toward this end, an AAV2/5 virus expressing either Cre-dependent NpHR-YFP or YFP only (control virus) was injected into the medial NAc of ChAT::IRES-Cre mice, and optical fibers were implanted bilaterally (Figures 2A–2C). Optogenetic inhibition of ChAT interneurons successfully suppressed action potentials, as confirmed with whole-cell recordings (Figures 2D, S2A, and S2B). A cocaine CPP assay was implemented as before, but in this case constant illumination of 590 nm light was delivered to inhibit activity during the first post-conditioning test (Test 1; Figure 2E). Inhibition of ChAT interneurons caused a decrease in extinction learning relative to control littermates (Figures 2F and 2G; F(2,37) = 15.23, p < 0.0001 for test day and F(1,18) = 5.63, p = 0.029 for group, repeated-measures ANOVA). Similar to the case of ChAT interneuron activation, the effect of inhibition on chamber preference persisted on the test days subsequent to the inhibition, meaning that these neurons modulate extinction learning rather than only having acute effects on expression of the memory (Figure 2G). Taken together with the results from activating ChAT interneurons (Figures 1G and S1B), these experiments indicate that ChAT interneuron activity provides bidirectional regulation of extinction learning for a cocaine-context association. In addition, similar to the case of activation, the inhibition of ChAT interneurons was not sufficient to drive a real-time CPP, again supporting the idea that ChAT interneurons modulate extinction learning without being able to drive new learning on their own (Figure 2H; p = 0.62, two-tailed t test). In addition, it is unlikely that these behavioral effects can be explained by nonspecific changes in anxiety-like behavior, as no effect of activation or inhibition of these neurons was observed on anxiety assays (open field test and elevated plus maze; Figures S1F, S1G, S2D, and S2E). Similarly, these manipulations did not generate a change in velocity, either in the open field or in the cocaine CPP extinction test (Figures S1H, S1I, S2F, and S2G). We next sought to test the hypothesis that ChAT interneurons could impact extinction learning by modulating synaptic plasticity in the NAc. Reward-related learning is associated with changes in the strength of excitatory synapses onto MSNs, the output neurons of the NAc (Lüscher and Malenka, 2011Lüscher C. Malenka R.C. Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in addiction: from molecular changes to circuit remodeling.Neuron. 2011; 69: 650-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, Britt et al., 2012Britt J.P. Benaliouad F. McDevitt R.A. Stuber G.D. Wise R.A. Bonci A. Synaptic and behavioral profile of multiple glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens.Neuron. 2012; 76: 790-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and thus ChAT interneurons may play a role in modulating such plasticity. To address this possibility, we compared miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in MSNs of mice in which ChAT interneurons had been optogenetically activated during the extinction test, relative to MSNs of control mice in which ChAT interneurons were not activated (Figures 3A–3C). In either case, mice were sacrificed immediately after the first extinction test (behavioral schematic in Figure 3A). Consistent with our earlier results (Figures 1G and S1B), activation of ChAT interneurons during the initial extinction test decreased chamber preference, which implies enhanced extinction learning (Figure 3B; F(1,15) = 32.1, p < 0.0001 for group and F(1, 15) = 8.40, p = 0.011 for test, two-way ANOVA; p = 0.0003 across groups for the test day, p = 0.28 for the pre-test day, Sidak’s post hoc test). Comparison of the mEPSCs from the two groups revealed a substantial decrease in the frequency of mEPSCs as a consequence of ChAT interneuron activation and no significant change in amplitude (Figure 3D; p < 0.001 for interevent interval and p = 0.11 for amplitude, mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details; no difference in basic membrane properties or recording conditions across groups; Figure S3B). The fact that ChAT interneurons mediate changes in chamber preference that persists during the days subsequent to their activation (Figures 1G and 2G) suggests that the concomitant plasticity in the NAc may also persist on the day following stimulation. Thus, we investigated whether or not ChAT-interneuron-mediated plasticity persisted on the day following stimulation by training a new cohort of mice on the cocaine CPP paradigm and activating ChAT interneurons during the first post-conditioning test day, as before (Figure 3E). In this case, mice were sacrificed and mEPSCs were measured on the day following the test day, rather than immediately after the test day as in the prior experiment (Figure 3E). As expected, ChAT interneuron activation on the test day was again associated with less cocaine chamber preference (Figure S3A; F(1, 16) = 11.02, p = 0.0043 for group and F(1,16) = 5.87, p = 0.027 for test, two-way ANOVA; p = 0.035 across groups for the test day, p = 0.29 for the pre-test day, Sidak’s post hoc test; no difference in basic membrane properties or recording conditions across groups; Figure S3C). In addition, once again, ChAT interneuron stimulation was associated with a decrease in the frequency and no change in the amplitude of mEPSCs in MSNs (Figure 3F; p = 0.03 for interevent interval and p = 0.4 for amplitude, mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details). In addition, there was no statistically significant interaction between the time the mice were sacrificed (0 hr versus 24 hr) and the effect of ChAT stimulation in explaining mEPSC frequency (p = 0.16 for stimulation × time interaction, mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details). We observed a change in frequency, but not amplitude, of mEPSCs as a result of ChAT interneuron activation (Figures 3D and 3F), implying that the site of plasticity mediated by ChAT interneurons may be presynaptic and not postsynaptic. However, reductions of mEPSC frequency can occur with loss of postsynaptic sites as well. To provide additional information regarding the site of plasticity, in a new cohort of mice we measured the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and the ratio of AMPA to NMDA receptor currents onto MSNs, the former an assay of presynaptic plasticity and the latter an assay of postsynaptic plasticity. To this end, mice underwent an identical cocaine CPP as described in Figure 3A, receiving activation of ChAT interneurons during the first extinction test followed immediately by ex vivo electrophysiological measurements (Figures 4A and 4B ). We observed a large enhancement in PPR as a consequence of ChAT interneuron stimulation, consistent with a presynaptic plasticity mechanism (Figure 4C; F(1,16) = 15.62, p = 0.0011 for group and F(2,32) = 7.4, p = 0.0023 for stimulation interval, two-way ANOVA; p = 0.0043 at 20 ms, p = 0.0019 at 50 ms, and p = 0.034 at 100 ms, Sidak’s post hoc test). In contrast, the change in AMPA/NMDA receptor current ratio was not statistically significant between the two groups (Figure 4D; p = 0.17, two-tailed t test). Note that this negative result does not rule out the possibility that there is postsynaptic plasticity that we were not able to detect with our assay. For example, opposing postsynaptic effects may occur in parallel in different subpopulations of MSNs (e.g., dopamine receptor 1 [D1R]- versus dopamine receptor 2 [D2R]-expressing MSNs). So far, we have determined that manipulation of activity in ChAT interneurons during the extinction of a cocaine CPP generates changes in both extinction learning and in glutamatergic plasticity onto MSNs. The presence of these two consequences of ChAT stimulation suggests that changes in glutamatergic plasticity may represent a neural substrate for extinction learning for a cocaine CPP. To determine if it is indeed the case that the reduction in mEPSC frequency is a neural manifestation of extinction learning, we trained two cohorts of mice on a cocaine CPP. After conditioning, one cohort received four extinction tests while the control cohort did not undergo any extinction tests (Figures 5A and 5B ). We found that multiple days of extinction training generates reductions in mEPSC frequency, but not amplitude (Figure 5C; p = 0.0135 for interevent interval, p = 0.70 for amplitude, mixed-effect linear regression; analysis details in Experimental Procedures), changes that closely mimic the changes that occur as a consequence of ChAT interneuron activation during a single extinction test (Figure 3D). This suggests that ChAT stimulation during a single extinction test accelerates the plasticity that naturally occurs during the course of repeated extinction sessions on a cocaine CPP. We next sought to determine if ChAT-interneuron-mediated plasticity depended on the mouse’s experience and context. These experiments were geared toward distinguishing between two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that activity in ChAT interneurons can generate plasticity regardless of context and experience. Alternatively, it could be that ChAT interneurons regulate the extent of plasticity if and when cocaine-context extinction is occurring. As detailed below, we took several approaches to distinguish between these hypotheses. Our first approach involved training mice on a cocaine CPP as before and comparing the effect of ChAT interneuron activation during the first extinction test (as before; Figures 1 and 3), versus activation immediately before the extinction test in the home cage (experiment schematic in Figure 6A). On a behavioral level, we observed a reduction in preference when stimulation occurred in the extinction context, suggesting that ChAT interneuron activity only affects extinction learning if the neurons are activated during the extinction test (Figure 6B; F(1,16) = 4.70, p = 0.046 for group and F(1,16) = 14.24, p = 0.0017 for test, two-way ANOVA; p = 0.013 across groups for the test day, p = 0.99 for the pre-test day, Sidak’s post hoc test ). We next sought to determine if there were differences in plasticity onto the MSNs between the groups that could underlie these differences in behavior. Indeed, we found a reduction in mEPSC frequency (but not amplitude) in MSNs when stimulation occurred during the extinction test, in comparison to when it occurred beforehand in the home cage (mice were sacrificed immediately after the test; Figure 6C; p = 0.02 for frequency, p = 0.39 for amplitude; mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details; no difference in basic membrane properties or recording conditions across groups; Figure S6A). In addition, there was no significant difference in mEPSC frequency or amplitude when comparing mice that received ChAT interneuron activation in the home cage relative to control mice that received no stimulation (control mice in Figure 3D; p = 0.9 for frequency, p = 0.9 for amplitude; mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details). These results support the hypothesis that ChAT interneurons regulate the extent of plasticity if and when it is occurring. Our second approach to identify the conditions under which ChAT interneurons mediate plasticity involved examining mEPSCs in MSNs of mice that underwent an identical conditioning procedure as before (Figure 3A), but instead of pairing cocaine injections to one chamber, they received saline injections in both chambers (“saline-only conditioning”; schematic in Figure 6D). In this case, there was no sign of learning (or extinction) since there was no reason for them to form a spatial preference (Figures 6E). During the test session, one group of mice received ChAT interneuron activation, while the control group did not. As expected, neither group of mice exhibited a spatial preference, and there was no effect on behavior of the optogenetic stimulation (Figure 6E; F(1,9) = 0.37, p = 0.55 for group and F(1,9) = 0.46, p = 0.51 for test, two-way ANOVA; p = 0.65 across groups for the test day, p = 0.23 for the pre-test day, Sidak’s post hoc test). We sacrificed the mice immediately after this test and compared mEPSCs ex vivo in MSNs of mice that received ChAT interneuron activation during the test, relative to MSNs of mice that received no ChAT interneuron activation. Comparison of mEPSCs in both groups revealed no effect of ChAT interneuron activation on the frequency or amplitude of mEPSCs (Figure 6F; p = 0.30 for frequency, p = 0.37 for amplitude; mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details; no change in basic membrane properties or recording conditions across groups; Figure S6B). Thus, given that in this experiment there was no spatial preference learning, these results further support the hypothesis that ChAT interneurons only regulate the extent of plasticity if and when it is occurring. Given that ChAT interneuron stimulation had no observable effect on mEPSCs in MSNs when performed in the home cage rather than in the conditioning chamber (Figures 6A–6C), nor did it have an effect in cocaine-naive mice (Figures 6D–6F), we assumed that activation of ChAT interneurons is also not able to induce changes in glutamatergic plasticity when activated in slices from naive mice. Indeed, we found that the amplitude of electrically evoked EPSCs did not change when comparing before and after 15 min of ChAT interneuron activation, which again supports the hypothesis that ChAT interneurons modulate plasticity only if and when it is occurring (Figure S6C). To determine if the effects of ChAT interneuron manipulations are specific to the extinction of a cocaine CPP or generalize to extinction of other contextual associations, we trained a new cohort of mice on a food CPP in which one chamber contained food and the other chamber was empty. As we did for the cocaine CPP extinction test (Figure 1), we activated ChAT interneurons during the first (of three) extinction tests (Figure 7A). In contrast to the case of the cocaine CPP, we found that ChAT interneuron activation had no effect on extinction of a food CPP (Figure 7B; F(1,17) = 0.71, p = 0.41 for group and F(2,34) = 7.86, p = 0.0016 for test day, repeated-measures ANOVA). Consistent with the lack of effect on behavior, we found that there was no ChAT-interneuron-mediated change in the frequency or amplitude of mEPSCs that were measured immediately after the first extinction test in separate groups of mice that were sacrificed at that time point (Figure 7C; p = 0.96 for frequency, p = 0.57 for amplitude; mixed-effect linear regression; see Experimental Procedures for details). We also examined the effect of ChAT interneuron activation on the extinction of a contextual fear memory. In this case, mice were trained to associate a chamber with a foot shock and then received ChAT interneuron activation"

We investigated healthy controls, patients with proposed risk factors for Candida growth in LRT (antibiotic therapy, ICU treatment with and without antibiotic therapy), ICU patients with pneumonia and antibiotic therapy and candidemic patients (for comparison of truly invasive and colonizing Candida spp.). Fungal patterns were determined by conventional culture based microbiology combined with molecular approaches (next generation sequencing, multilocus sequence typing) for description of fungal and concommitant bacterial microbiota in LRT, and host and fungal biomarkes were investigated. Admission to and treatment on ICUs shifted LRT fungal microbiota to Candida spp. dominated fungal profiles but antibiotic therapy did not. Compared to controls, Candida was part of fungal microbiota in LRT of ICU patients without pneumonia with and without antibiotic therapy (63% and 50% of total fungal genera) and of ICU patients with pneumonia with antibiotic therapy (73%) (p<0.05). No case of invasive candidiasis originating from Candida in the LRT was detected. There was no common bacterial microbiota profile associated or dissociated with Candida spp. in LRT. Colonizing and invasive Candida strains (from candidemic patients) did not match to certain clades withdrawing the presence of a particular pathogenic and invasive clade. The presence of Candida spp. in the LRT rather reflected rapidly occurring LRT dysbiosis driven by ICU related factors than was associated with invasive candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2400122764,"REC8 meiotic recombination protein (REC8) was found to be preferentially methylated in gastric cancer (GC) using promoter methylation array. We aimed to elucidate the epigenetic alteration and biological function of REC8 in GC. REC8 was downregulated in 100% (3/3) of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive and 80% (8/10) of EBV-negative GC cell lines by promoter methylation, but the expression could be restored through demethylation treatment. Protein expression of REC8 was significantly lower in human primary gastric tumors than in adjacent non-tumor tissues. A negative correlation between methylation and mRNA expression of REC8 was observed in 223 gastric samples of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (r=−0.7018, P<0.001). The methylation level (%) of the REC8 promoter was significantly higher in EBV-positive gastric tumors than in EBV-negative gastric tumors, as shown by bisulfite genomic sequencing (77.6 (69.3–80.5) vs 51.4 (39.5–62.3), median (interquartile range); P<0.001); methylation levels in both subtypes of tumors were significantly higher than in normal stomach tissues (14.8 (4.2–24.0)) (both P<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that REC8 methylation was an independent factor for poor survival in GC patients (hazard ratio=1.68, P<0.05). REC8 expression significantly suppressed cell viability, clonogenicity and cell cycle progression; it induced apoptosis and inhibited migration of AGS-EBV (EBV-positive) and BGC823 (EBV-negative) GC cells, and it suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice. In contrast, knockdown of REC8 in gastric epithelial immortalized GES-1 cells significantly increased cell viability, clonogenicity and migration ability. The tumor-suppressive effect of REC8 is mediated at least in part by the downregulation of genes involved in cell growth (G6PD, SLC2A1, NOL3, MCM2, SNAI1 and SNAI2), and the upregulation of apoptosis/migration inhibitors (GADD45G and LDHA) and tumor suppressors (PinX1, IGFBP3 and ETS2). In conclusion, REC8 is a novel tumor suppressor that is commonly downregulated by promoter methylation in GC, especially in the EBV-associated subtype. Promoter methylation of REC8 is an independent risk factor for the shortened survival of GC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2403120719,"A small, multigene family encodes 4-coumarate:CoA ligases (4CLs) that catalyze the ligation of CoA to hydroxycinnamic acids, a branch point directing metabolites to flavonoid or monolignol pathways. In this study, we characterized four 4CL genes from M. notabilis Genome Database, and cloned four Ma4CL genes from M. atropurpurea cv. Jialing No.40. A tissue-specific expression analysis indicated that Ma4CL3 was expressed at higher levels than the other genes, and that Ma4CL3 was strongly expressed in root bark, stem bark, and old leaves. Additionally, the expression pattern of Ma4CL3 was similar to the trend of the total flavonoid content throughout fruit development. A phylogenetic analysis suggested that Mn4CL1, Mn4CL2, and Mn4CL4 belong to class I 4CLs, and Mn4CL3 belongs to class II 4CLs. Ma4CL genes responded differently to a series of stresses. Ma4CL3 expression was higher than that of the other Ma4CL genes following wounding, salicylic acid, and ultraviolet treatments. An in vitro enzyme assay indicated that 4-coumarate acid was the best substrate among cinnamic acid, 4-coumarate acid, and caffeate acid, but no catalytic activity to sinapate acid and ferulate acid. The results of subcellular localization experiments showed that Ma4CL3 localized to the cytomembrane, where it activated transcription. We used different vectors and strategies to fuse Ma4CL3 with stilbene synthase (STS) to construct four Ma4CL-MaSTS co-expression systems to generate resveratrol. The results indicated that only a transcriptional fusion vector, pET-Ma4CL3-T-MaSTS, which utilized a T7 promoter and lac operator for the expression of MaSTS, could synthesize resveratrol."

https://openalex.org/W2404932060,"Suboptimal temperature stress often causes heavy yield losses of vegetables by suppressing plant growth during winter and early spring. Gibberellin acid (GA) has been reported to be involved in plant growth and acquisition of mineral nutrients. However, no studies have evaluated the role of GA in the regulation of growth and nutrient acquisition by vegetables under conditions of suboptimal temperatures in greenhouse. Here, we investigated the roles of GA in the regulation of growth and nitrate acquisition of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants under conditions of short-term suboptimal root-zone temperatures (Tr). Exposure of cucumber seedlings to a Tr of 16°C led to a significant reduction in root growth, and this inhibitory effect was reversed by exogenous application of GA. Expression patterns of several genes encoding key enzymes in GA metabolism were altered by suboptimal Tr treatment, and endogenous GA concentrations in cucumber roots were significantly reduced by exposure of cucumber plants to 16°C Tr, suggesting that inhibition of root growth by suboptimal Tr may result from disruption of endogenous GA homeostasis. To further explore the mechanism underlying the GA-dependent cucumber growth under suboptimal Tr, we studied the effect of suboptimal Tr and GA on nitrate uptake, and found that exposure of cucumber seedlings to 16°C Tr led to a significant reduction in nitrate uptake rate, and exogenous application GA can alleviate the down-regulation by up regulating the expression of genes associated with nitrate uptake. Finally, we demonstrated that N accumulation in cucumber seedlings under suboptimal Tr conditions was improved by exogenous application of GA due probably to both enhanced root growth and nitrate absorption activity. These results indicate that a reduction in endogenous GA concentrations in roots due to down-regulation of GA biosynthesis at transcriptional level may be a key event to underpin the suboptimal Tr-induced inhibition of root growth and nitrate uptake. These findings may have important practical implications in effective mitigation of suboptimal temperature-induced vegetable loss under greenhouse conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2397003243,"The conserved Myb-MuvB (MMB) multiprotein complex has an important role in transcriptional activation of mitotic genes. MMB target genes are overexpressed in several different cancer types and their elevated expression is associated with an advanced tumor state and a poor prognosis. This suggests that MMB could contribute to tumorigenesis by mediating overexpression of mitotic genes. However, although MMB has been extensively characterized biochemically, the requirement for MMB in tumorigenesis in vivo has not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that MMB is required for tumor formation in a mouse model of lung cancer driven by oncogenic K-RAS. We also identify a requirement for the mitotic kinesin KIF23, a key target gene of MMB, in tumorigenesis. RNA interference-mediated depletion of KIF23 inhibited lung tumor formation in vivo and induced apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that inhibition of KIF23 could be a strategy for treatment of lung cancer."

We evaluated how effective the Thai piperaceae plants Piper betle, P. nigrum and P. sarmentosum are against Toxoplasma gondii infection in vitro and in vivo. Individually, we extracted the piperaceae plants with ethanol, passed them through a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized them to obtain crude extracts for each one. The in vitro study indicated that the P. betle extract was the most effective extract at inhibiting parasite growth in HFF cells (IC50 on RH-GFP: 23.2 μg/mL, IC50 on PLK-GFP: 21.4 μg/mL). Furthermore, treatment of experimental mice with the P. betle extract for 7 days after infection with 1,000 tachyzoites of the T. gondii PLK strain increased their survival (survival rates: 100% in 400 mg/kg-treated, 83.3% in 100 mg/kg-treated, 33.3% in 25 mg/kg-treated, 33.3% in untreated mice). Furthermore, treatment with 400 mg/kg of the P. betle extract resulted in 100% mouse survival following infection with 100,000 tachyzoites. The present study shows that P. betle extract has the potential to act as a medical plant for the treatment of toxoplasmosis."
https://openalex.org/W2408222570,"The effect of respiratory tract viral infection on evoked cough in guinea pigs was evaluated. Guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally with either parainfluenza type 3 (PIV3) and cough was quantified in conscious animals. The guinea pigs infected with PIV3 (day 4) coughed nearly three times more than those treated with the viral growth medium in response to capsaicin, citric acid, and bradykinin. Since capsaicin, citric acid, and bradykinin evoked coughing in guinea pigs can be inhibited by drugs that antagonize the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1), it was reasoned that the virally-induced hypertussive state may involve alterations in TPRV1 activity. PIV3 infection caused a phenotypic switch in tracheal nodose Aδ “cough receptors” such that nearly 50% of neurons began to express, de novo, TRPV1 mRNA. There was also an increase TRPV1 expression in jugular C-fiber neurons as determined by qPCR. It has previously been reported that tracheal-specific nodose neurons express the BDNF receptor TrkB and jugular neurons express the NGF receptor TrkA. Jugular neurons also express the artemin receptor GFRα3. All these neurotrophic factors have been associated with increases in TRPV1 expression. In an ex vivo perfused guinea pig tracheal preparation, we demonstrated that within 8 h of PIV3 infusion there was no change in NGF mRNA expression, but there was nearly a 10-fold increase in BDNF mRNA in the tissue, and a small but significant elevation in the expression of artemin mRNA. In summary, PIV3 infection leads to elevations in TRPV1 expression in the two key cough evoking nerve subtypes in the guinea pig trachea, and this is associated with a hypertussive state with respect to various TRPV1 activating stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2405724708,"Tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons form a separate biophysical and processing compartment. Presently, little is known about plasticity mechanisms in this isolated compartment. Here, we describe a novel form of plasticity in which unpaired low-frequency (0.1 Hz) stimulation of tuft inputs resulted in prolonged transient (86.3 ± 7.3 min) potentiation of EPSPs (286.1% ± 30.5%) and enhanced local excitability that enabled more-efficient back-propagation of axo-somatic action potentials and dendritic calcium spikes selectively into the activated dendritic segments. This plasticity was exclusive to tuft dendrites and did not occur in basal dendrites. Induction of this plasticity depended on activation of Kv4.2 potassium and NMDAR channels, internalization of membrane proteins, and insertion of AMPAR. This unique form of tuft plasticity increases proximal-distal electrical coupling of activated tuft dendrites and opens a prolonged time window for binding and storing feedforward and feedback information in a branch-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2407412660,"The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a well-established invasive model organism. Although extensively used in environmental sciences, virtually nothing is known of the molecular process of its shell calcification. By describing the microstructure, geochemistry and biochemistry/proteomics of the shell, the present study aims at promoting this species as a model organism in biomineralization studies, in order to establish a bridge with ecotoxicology, while sketching evolutionary conclusions. The shell of D. polymorpha exhibits the classical crossed-lamellar/complex crossed lamellar combination found in several heterodont bivalves, in addition to an external thin layer, the characteristics of which differ from what was described in earlier publication. We show that the shell selectively concentrates some heavy metals, in particular uranium, which predisposes D. polymorpha to local bioremediation of this pollutant. We establish the biochemical signature of the shell matrix, demonstrating that it interacts with the in vitro precipitation of calcium carbonate and inhibits calcium carbonate crystal formation, but these two properties are not strongly expressed. This matrix, although overall weakly glycosylated, contains a set of putatively calcium-binding proteins and a set of acidic sulphated proteins. 2D-gels reveal more than fifty proteins, twenty of which we identify by MS-MS analysis. We tentatively link the shell protein profile of D. polymorpha and the peculiar recent evolution of this invasive species of Ponto-Caspian origin, which has spread all across Europe in the last three centuries."

Ingenuity Pathways Analysis indicated that three genes belonging to the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) pathway were downregulated only in muscles atrophying because of cancer: stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1), adenylate cyclase 7 (ADCY7), and p21 protein-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). Notably, we found that, in the Rectus Abdominis muscle of cancer patients, the expression of SDF1 and CXCR4 was inversely correlated with that of two ubiquitin ligases induced in muscle wasting, atrogin-1 and MuRF1, suggesting a possible clinical relevance of this pathway. The expression of all main SDF1 isoforms (α, β, γ) also declined in Tibialis Anterior muscle from cachectic mice bearing murine colon adenocarcinoma or human renal cancer and drugs with anticachexia properties restored their expression. Overexpressing genes of this pathway (that is, SDF1 or CXCR4) in cachectic muscles increased the fiber area by 20%, protecting them from wasting. Similarly, atrophying myotubes treated with either SDF1α or SDF1β had greater total protein content, resulting from reduced degradation of overall long-lived proteins. However, inhibiting CXCR4 signaling with the antagonist AMD3100 did not affect protein homeostasis in atrophying myotubes, whereas normal myotubes treated with AMD3100 showed time- and dose-dependent reductions in diameter, until a plateau, and lower total protein content. This further confirms the involvement of a saturable pathway (that is, CXCR4). Overall, these findings support the idea that activating the CXCR4 pathway in muscle suppresses the deleterious wasting associated with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2404945632,"Background Skin prick test (SPT) is a common test for diagnosing immunoglobulin E-mediated allergies. In clinical routine, technicalities, human errors or patient-related biases, occasionally results in suboptimal diagnosis of sensitization. Objective Although not previously assessed qualitatively, lancet weight is hypothesized to be important when performing SPT to minimize the frequency of false positives, false negatives, and unwanted discomfort. Methods Accurate weight-controlled SPT was performed on the volar forearms and backs of 20 healthy subjects. Four predetermined lancet weights were applied (25 g, 85 g, 135 g and 265 g) using two positive control histamine solutions (1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) and one negative control (saline). A total of 400 SPTs were conducted. The outcome parameters were: wheal size, neurogenic inflammation (measured by superficial blood perfusion), frequency of bleeding, and the lancet provoked pain response. Results The mean wheal diameter increased significantly as higher weights were applied to the SPT lancet, e.g. from 3.2 ± 0.28 mm at 25 g to 5.4 ± 1.7 mm at 265 g (p<0.01). Similarly, the frequency of bleeding, the provoked pain, and the neurogenic inflammatory response increased significantly. At 265 g saline evoked two wheal responses (/160 pricks) below 3 mm. Conclusion and clinical relevance The applied weight of the lancet during the SPT-procedure is an important factor. Higher lancet weights precipitate significantly larger wheal reactions with potential diagnostic implications. This warrants additional research of the optimal lancet weight in relation to SPT-guidelines to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the procedure."
https://openalex.org/W2403854759,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked muscle disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. The pathology of DMD manifests in patients with progressive muscle weakness, loss of ambulation and ultimately death. One of the characteristics of DMD is muscle inflammation, and dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscles produce higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in response to toll like receptor (TLR) stimulation compared to controls; therefore, blocking the IL-1β pathway could improve the disease phenotype in mdx mice, a mouse model of DMD. Kineret® or IL-1Ra is a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist approved by the FDA for treating rheumatoid arthritis. To determine the efficacy of IL-1Ra in a DMD model, we administered subcutaneous injections of saline control or IL-1Ra (25 mg/kg/day) to mdx mice daily for 45 days beginning at 5 weeks of age. Functional and histological parameters were measured at the conclusion of the study. IL-1Ra only partially inhibited this signaling pathway in this study; however, there were still interesting observations to be noted. For example, although not significantly changed, splenocytes from the IL-1Ra-treated group secreted less IL-1β after LPS stimulation compared to control mice indicating a blunted response and incomplete inhibition of the pathway (37% decrease). In addition, normalized forelimb grip strength was significantly increased in IL-1Ra-treated mice. There were no changes in EDL muscle-specific force measurements, histological parameters, or motor coordination assessments in the dystrophic mice after IL-1Ra treatment. There was a significant 27% decrease in the movement time and total distance traveled by the IL-1Ra treated mice, correlating with previous studies examining effects of IL-1 on behavior. Our studies indicate partial blocking of IL-1β with IL-1Ra significantly altered only a few behavioral and strength related disease parameters; however, treatment with inhibitors that completely block IL-1β, pathways upstream of IL-1β production or combining various inhibitors may produce more favorable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2404607738,"Bari elements are members of the Tc1-mariner superfamily of DNA transposons, originally discovered in Drosophila melanogaster, and subsequently identified in silico in 11 sequenced Drosophila genomes and as experimentally isolated in four non-sequenced Drosophila species. Bari-like elements have been also studied for their mobility both in vivo and in vitro. We analyzed 23 Drosophila genomes and carried out a detailed characterization of the Bari elements identified, including those from the heterochromatic Bari1 cluster in D. melanogaster. We have annotated 401 copies of Bari elements classified either as putatively autonomous or inactive according to the structure of the terminal sequences and the presence of a complete transposase-coding region. Analyses of the integration sites revealed that Bari transposase prefers AT-rich sequences in which the TA target is cleaved and duplicated. Furthermore evaluation of transposon’s co-occurrence near the integration sites of Bari elements showed a non-random distribution of other transposable elements. We also unveil the existence of a putatively autonomous Bari1 variant characterized by two identical long Terminal Inverted Repeats, in D. rhopaloa. In addition, we detected MITEs related to Bari transposons in 9 species. Phylogenetic analyses based on transposase gene and the terminal sequences confirmed that Bari-like elements are distributed into three subfamilies. A few inconsistencies in Bari phylogenetic tree with respect to the Drosophila species tree could be explained by the occurrence of horizontal transfer events as also suggested by the results of dS analyses. This study further clarifies the Bari transposon’s evolutionary dynamics and increases our understanding on the Tc1-mariner elements’ biology."
https://openalex.org/W2394831332,"Incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) varies wildly across the world and seems to be low in Central and South America (4.2 per 100 000 person-years; CI 95%; 3.1-5.7). The objective of our study was to describe the characteristics of SAH and to estimate its incidence and severity in Martinique, a small French island located in the Caribbean Sea.Due to its insular nature and small captive population, Martinique is ideal for the setting up of population-based epidemiological studies with good exhaustiveness. Our study, spanning a 7 year period (2007-2013), consisted of retrospective case ascertainment with multiple overlapping methods. Crude incidence and 30 day case-fatality rates for SAH among the Martinican population were computed for the study period. Incidence and disease severity was also analyzed according to age, gender and aneurysm presence. World age-standardized incidence rates were also calculated.A total of 121 patients had a SAH during the study period, with a higher frequency of female cases (71.1% versus 28.9%, p<0.001). Patient mean age was 57.1 years (median = 55 [46-66]). An aneurysmal origin was found in 96 SAH cases (79.3%). Crude annual incidence was 4.36 per 100 000 person-years (CI 95% 2.30-6.42). World age-standardized incidence was 3.29 per 100 000 person-years (CI 95% 1.74-4.84). During the 30 days following SAH diagnosis, 29 patients died (case fatality rate: 24% (CI 95% 16.4-31.6)).The incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage in Martinique is much lower than in other parts of the world and similar to countries in Central and South America. These results are possibly related to environmental factors and most particularly to a low rate of smoking in the Martinican population. Thirty-day case-fatality rate is similar to what is observed in developed countries."
https://openalex.org/W2397589153,"Introduction of non-native species is a leading threat to global aquatic biodiversity. Competition between native and non-native species is often influenced by changes in suitable habitat or food availability. We investigated diet breadth and degree of trophic niche overlap for a fish assemblage of native and non-native species inhabiting a shallow, high elevation lake system. This assemblage includes one of the last remaining post-glacial endemic populations of adfluvial Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in the contiguous United States. We examined gut contents and stable isotope values of fish taxa in fall and spring to assess both short- (days) and long-term (few months) changes in trophic niches. We incorporate these short-term (gut contents) data into a secondary isotope analysis using a Bayesian statistical framework to estimate long-term trophic niche. Our data suggest that in this system, Arctic grayling share both a short- and long-term common food base with non-native trout of cutthroat x rainbow hybrid species (Oncorhynchus clarkia bouvieri x Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). In addition, trophic niche overlap among Arctic grayling, hybrid trout, and brook trout appeared to be stronger during spring than fall. In contrast, the native species of Arctic grayling, burbot (Lota lota), and suckers (Catostomus spp.) largely consumed different prey items. Our results suggest strong seasonal differences in trophic niche overlap among Arctic grayling and non-native trout, with a potential for greatest competition for food during spring. We suggest that conservation of endemic Arctic grayling in high-elevation lakes will require recognition of the potential for coexisting non-native taxa to impede well-intentioned recovery efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2397790002,"Xiaochangliang (XCL), located in the Nihewan Basin of North China, is a key archaeological locality for understanding the behavioural evolution of early humans. XCL dates to ca. 1.36 Ma, making it one of the earliest sites in Northeast Asia. Although XCL represents the first excavation of an Early Pleistocene site in the Nihewan Basin, identified and excavated in the 1970’s, the lithic assemblages have never been published in full detail. Here we describe the lithic assemblages from XCL, providing information on stone tool reduction techniques and the influence of raw materials on artefact manufacture. The XCL hominins used both bipolar and freehand reduction techniques to manufacture small flakes, some of which show retouch. Bipolar reduction methods at XCL were used more frequently than previously recognized. Comparison of XCL with other Early Pleistocene sites in the Nihewan Basin indicates the variable use of bipolar and freehand reduction methods, thereby indicating a flexible approach in the utilization of raw materials. The stone tools from XCL and the Nihewan sites are classifiable as Mode I lithic assemblages, readily distinguished from bifacial industries manufactured by hominins in Eastern Asia by ca. 800 ka."
https://openalex.org/W2396481269,"Two stilbenes, resveratrol and pterostilbene, exhibit antifungal activity against Leptosphaeria maculans, the fungal pathogen responsible for blackleg (stem canker) in canola (Brassica napus). In vitro studies on the effect of these stilbenes on L. maculans mycelial growth and conidia germination showed that pterostilbene is a potent fungicide and sporicide, but resveratrol only exerted minor inhibition on L. maculans. Cell viability of hyphae cultures was markedly reduced by pterostilbene and SYTOX green staining showed that cell membrane integrity was compromised. We demonstrate that pterostilbene exerts fungicidal activity across 10 different L. maculans isolates and the compound confers protection to the blackleg-susceptible canola cv. Westar seedlings. The potential of pterostilbene as a control agent against blackleg in canola is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2399390338,"To explore the potential alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and functional connectivity of recent onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) induced by a single prolonged trauma exposure, we recruited 20 survivors experiencing the same coal mining flood disaster as the PTSD (n = 10) and non-PTSD (n = 10) group, respectively. The pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) images were acquired with a 3.0T MRI scanner and the partial volume (PV) effect in the images was corrected for better CBF estimation. Alterations in CBF were analyzed using both uncorrected and PV-corrected CBF maps. By using altered CBF regions as regions-of-interest, seed-based functional connectivity analysis was then performed. While only one CBF deficit in right corpus callosum of PTSD patients was detected using uncorrected CBF, three more regions (bilateral frontal lobes and right superior frontal gyrus) were identified using PV-corrected CBF. Furthermore, the regional CBF of right superior frontal gyrus exhibited significantly negative correlation with the symptom severity (r = -0.759, p = 0.018). The resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed increased connectivity between left frontal lobe and right parietal lobe. The results indicated the symptom-specific perfusion deficits and an aberrant connectivity in memory-related regions of PTSD patients when using PV-corrected ASL data. It also suggested that PV-corrected CBF exhibits more subtle changes that may be beneficial to perfusion and connectivity analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2402848516,"Background Brain metastasis is a common endpoint in patients suffering from malignant melanoma. However, little is known about factors that predispose to brain metastases. Objective We performed a retrospective clinical and pathological investigation of melanoma patients with brain metastases in order to better characterise this patient population. Methods 193 melanoma patients with brain metastasis histologically diagnosed between 1990 and 2015 at the University Hospital Zurich were retrospectively identified and further specified for sex, age at diagnosis and detection of brain metastasis, and localisation. In addition, data were extracted regarding the subtype of primary melanoma, Breslow tumour thickness, Clark Level, mutation status, extent of metastatic spread and history of a second melanoma. Results We found a significant male predominance (n = 126/193; 65%; p < 0.001). Breslow tumour thickness showed a wide range from 0.2 to 12.0 mm (n = 99; median 2.3 mm). 14 of 101 melanomas (14%) were classified as T1, thereof 11 (79%) were found in men. In 32 of 193 patients (17%), the primary melanoma was unknown. Conclusions Of special interest in our series is the high incidence of male predominance (79%) in cases of thin metastasing melanoma (14%), implicating genetic or epigenetic (hormonal) gender differences underlying tumour progression. Additionally, the high percentage of unknown primary melanoma (17%), at least partly representing completely regressed melanomas, indicates the importance of immune surveillance in melanoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2402855501,"Canine herpesvirus is a widespread alphaherpesvirus that causes a fatal haemorrhagic disease of neonatal puppies. We have used high-throughput methods to determine the genome sequences of three viral strains (0194, V777 and V1154) isolated in the United Kingdom between 1985 and 2000. The sequences are very closely related to each other. The canine herpesvirus genome is estimated to be 125 kbp in size and consists of a unique long sequence (97.5 kbp) and a unique short sequence (7.7 kbp) that are each flanked by terminal and internal inverted repeats (38 bp and 10.0 kbp, respectively). The overall nucleotide composition is 31.6% G+C, which is the lowest among the completely sequenced alphaherpesviruses. The genome contains 76 open reading frames predicted to encode functional proteins, all of which have counterparts in other alphaherpesviruses. The availability of the sequences will facilitate future research on the diagnosis and treatment of canine herpesvirus-associated disease."
https://openalex.org/W2403337402,"Some cyanobacteria are capable of differentiating a variety of cell types in response to environmental factors. For instance, in low nitrogen conditions, some cyanobacteria form heterocysts, which are specialized for N2 fixation. Many heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria have DNA elements interrupting key N2 fixation genes, elements that are excised during heterocyst differentiation. While the mechanism for the excision of the element has been well-studied, many questions remain regarding the introduction of the elements into the cyanobacterial lineage and whether they have been retained ever since or have been lost and reintroduced. To examine the evolutionary relationships and possible function of DNA sequences that interrupt genes of heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, we identified and compared 101 interruption element sequences within genes from 38 heterocyst-forming cyanobacterial genomes. The interruption element lengths ranged from about 1 kb (the minimum able to encode the recombinase responsible for element excision), up to nearly 1 Mb. The recombinase gene sequences served as genetic markers that were common across the interruption elements and were used to track element evolution. Elements were found that interrupted 22 different orthologs, only five of which had been previously observed to be interrupted by an element. Most of the newly identified interrupted orthologs encode proteins that have been shown to have heterocyst-specific activity. However, the presence of interruption elements within genes with no known role in N2 fixation, as well as in three non-heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, indicates that the processes that trigger the excision of elements may not be limited to heterocyst development or that the elements move randomly within genomes. This comprehensive analysis provides the framework to study the history and behavior of these unique sequences, and offers new insight regarding the frequency and persistence of interruption elements in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2403159758,"Rationale for dietary advice in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is based in part on animal studies that have examined non-orthologous models with progressive development of cystic disease. Since no model completely mimics human PKD, the purpose of the current studies was to examine the effects of dietary soy protein (compared to casein) or oils enriched in omega-3 fatty acids (fish or flax oil compared to soy oil) on early disease progression in two orthologous models of PKD. The models studied were Pkd2WS25/- mice as a model of autosomal dominant PKD, and PCK rats as a model of autosomal recessive PKD. After 13 weeks of feeding, dietary fish (but not flax) oil resulted in larger kidneys and greater kidney water content in female Pkd2WS25/- compared to control mice. After 12 weeks of feeding male PCK compared to control rats, both fish and flax compared to soy oil resulted in enlarged kidneys and livers, greater kidney water content and higher kidney cyst area in diseased rats. Dietary soy protein compared to casein had no effects in Pkd2WS25/- compared to control mice. In PCK rats, kidney and liver histology were not improved, but lower proteinuria and higher urine pH suggest that soy protein could be beneficial in the long term. Therefore, in contrast to studies in non-orthologous models during the progressive development phase, these studies in orthologous PKD models do not support dietary advice to increase soy protein or oils enriched in omega-3 oils in early PKD."
https://openalex.org/W2404100844,"Increasingly consumption of healthy foods is advised to improve population health. Reasons people give for choosing one food over another suggest that non-sensory features like health aspects are appreciated as of lower importance than taste. However, many food choices are made in the absence of the actual perception of a food's sensory properties, and therefore highly rely on previous experiences of similar consumptions stored in memory. In this study we assessed the differential strength of food associations implicitly stored in memory, using an associative priming paradigm. Participants (N = 30) were exposed to a forced-choice picture-categorization task, in which the food or non-food target images were primed with either non-sensory or sensory related words. We observed a smaller N400 amplitude at the parietal electrodes when categorizing food as compared to non-food images. While this effect was enhanced by the presentation of a food-related word prime during food trials, the primes had no effect in the non-food trials. More specifically, we found that sensory associations are stronger implicitly represented in memory as compared to non-sensory associations. Thus, this study highlights the neuronal mechanisms underlying previous observations that sensory associations are important features of food memory, and therefore a primary motive in food choice."
https://openalex.org/W2399371263,"For birds, plumage color perception is critical in social interactions such as courtship, in both monochromatic and dichromatic species. In the Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata), perhaps the most abundant South American Columbiforme, the plumage of males and females looks alike and both sexes share the same melanistic coloration with gray and pink tones. The aim of this study was therefore to determine whether evident sexual dichromatism exists in the plumage of the Eared Dove using a spectrophotometry technique in the avian-visible range (300-700 nm). The results of the classic colorimetric variables analysis (hue, chroma and brightness) show that males are in general brighter and have higher UV chroma values than females. The avian visual model points to differences in achromatic and chromatic levels between males and females in body regions possibly involved in sexual selection (e.g. the crown). The model also indicates chromatic or achromatic differences in body regions not subject to sexual selection such as the black spots on the wing coverts and white tail bands, both of which may be involved in intra- or inter-gender-specific communication."

Sputum samples were collected from patients attending three hospitals in Tanzania, and were investigated for pulmonary tuberculosis by microscopy between November 2010 and June 2012. The patients were interviewed about background information, and potential exposure to mycobacteria.We examined 1,711 presumptive tuberculosis cases where 936 (54.2%) were males and 775 (45.3%) females. Of all the study participants, 277 (16%) were found to have sputum samples positive for mycobacteria; 228 (13%) were smear positive, 123 (7%) were culture positive and 74 (4%) were positive by both smear microscopy and culture. Of the 123 mycobacterial culture positive, 15 (12.2%) had non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Males were more likely than females to be positive for mycobacteria. Factors associated with mycobacterial disease were loss of appetite, age groups below 41 years, and being a male. Among HIV negative patients, loss of appetite, age below 20 years and being a male were associated with being mycobacterial positive. Among HIV positive patients, males and those patients with a persistently coughing family member were more likely to harbor mycobacteria.The findings in this study show that both M. tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial strains were prevalent in the study community. Some risk factors were identified. Although the reported predictors may improve screening for mycobacterial diseases, their use requires some precaution."
https://openalex.org/W2404187764,"With the development of new technologies in transcriptome and epigenetics, RNAs have been identified to play more and more important roles in life processes. Consequently, various methods have been proposed to assess the biological functions of RNAs and thus classify them functionally, among which comparative study of RNA structures is perhaps the most important one. To measure the structural similarity of RNAs and classify them, we propose a novel three dimensional (3D) graphical representation of RNA secondary structure, in which an RNA secondary structure is first transformed into a characteristic sequence based on chemical property of nucleic acids; a dynamic 3D graph is then constructed for the characteristic sequence; and lastly a numerical characterization of the 3D graph is used to represent the RNA secondary structure. We tested our algorithm on three datasets: (1) Dataset I consisting of nine RNA secondary structures of viruses, (2) Dataset II consisting of complex RNA secondary structures including pseudo-knots, and (3) Dataset III consisting of 18 non-coding RNA families. We also compare our method with other nine existing methods using Dataset II and III. The results demonstrate that our method is better than other methods in similarity measurement and classification of RNA secondary structures."
https://openalex.org/W2402199172,"Over the past half century, thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified by using animal models and plant populations. However, the none-reliability and imprecision of the genomic regions of these loci have remained the major hurdle for the identification of the causal genes for the correspondent traits. We used a none-experimental strategy of strain number reduction for testing accuracy and ascertainment of the candidate region for QTL. We tested the strategy in over 400 analyses with data from 47 studies. These studies include: 1) studies with recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice. We first tested two previously mapped QTL with well-defined genomic regions; We then tested additional four studies with known QTL regions; and finally we examined the reliability of QTL in 38 sets of data which are produced from relatively large numbers of RI strains, derived from C57BL/6J (B6) X DBA/2J (D2), known as BXD RI mouse strains; 2) studies with RI strains of rats and plants; and 3) studies using F2 populations in mice, rats and plants. In these cases, our method identified the reliability of mapped QTL and localized the candidate genes into the defined genomic regions. Our data also suggests that LRS score produced by permutation tests does not necessarily confirm the reliability of the QTL. Number of strains are not the reliable indicators for the accuracy of QTL either. Our strategy determines the reliability and accuracy of the genomic region of a QTL without any additional experimental study such as congenic breeding."

These populations are exposed to chronic low-level ground gas emissions and various pollutants from geothermal water. The aim was to assess whether habitation in geothermal areas and utilisation of geothermal water is associated with risk of cancer according to duration of residence.The cohort obtained from the census 1981 was followed to the end of 2013. Personal identifier was used in record linkage with nation-wide emigration, death, and cancer registries. The exposed population, defined by community codes, was located on young bedrock and had utilised geothermal water supply systems since 1972. Two reference populations were located by community codes on older bedrock or had not utilised geothermal water supply systems for as long a period as had the exposed population. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) non-stratified and stratified on cumulative years of residence were estimated in Cox-model.The HR for all cancer was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12-1.30) as compared with the first reference area. The HR for pancreatic cancer was 1.93 (1.22-3.06), breast cancer, 1.48 (1.23-1.80), prostate cancer 1.47 (1.22-1.77), kidney cancer 1.46 (1.03-2.05), lymphoid and haematopoietic tissue 1.54 (1.21-1.97), non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma 2.08 (1.38-3.15) and basal cell carcinoma of the skin 1.62 (1.35-1.94). Positive dose-response relationship was observed between incidence of cancers and duration of residence, and between incidence of cancer and degree of geothermal/volcanic activity in the comparison areas.The higher cancer incidence in geothermal areas than in reference areas is consistent with previous findings. As the dose-response relationships were positive between incidence of cancers and duration of residence, it is now more urgent than before to investigate the chemical and physical content of the geothermal water and of the ambient air of the areas to detect recognized or new carcinogens."

The iNKT cell-CD1d axis is conserved between humans and mice, and human CD1d reactivity of murine iNKT cells have been described. However, the detailed differences between the recognition of human and mouse CD1d bound to various self-lipids by mouse iNKT TCRs are largely unknown. In this study, we generated a de novo murine iNKT TCR repertoire with a wider range of autoreactivity compared with that of naturally occurring peripheral iNKT TCRs. Vβ8.2 mouse iNKT TCRs capable of recognizing the human CD1d-self-lipid tetramer were identified, although such clones were not detectable in the Vβ7 or Vβ2 iNKT TCR repertoire. In line with previously reports, clonotypic Vβ8.2 iNKT TCRs with unique CDR3β loops did not discriminate among lipids presented by mouse CD1d. Unexpectedly, however, these iNKT TCRs showed greater ligand selectivity toward human CD1d presenting the same lipids. Our findings demonstrated that the recognition of mouse and human CD1d-self-lipid complexes by murine iNKT TCRs is not conserved, thereby further elucidating the differences between cognate and cross-species reactivity of self-antigens by mouse iNKT TCRs."
