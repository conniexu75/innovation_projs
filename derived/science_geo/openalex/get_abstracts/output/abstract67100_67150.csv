https://openalex.org/W1969469807,Cats were raised from birth with one eye viewing horizontal lines and one eye viewing vertical lines. Elongated receptive fields of cells in the visual cortex were horizontally or vertically oriented-no oblique fields were found. Units with horizontal fields were activated only by the eye exposed to horizontal lines; units with vertical fields only by the eye exposed to vertical lines.

This reduction apparently results from a release or displacement, or both, of serotonin from its storage sites."

https://openalex.org/W2030255194,"In the brains of rats without tolerance to morphine, the accumulation of [(14)C]dopamine formed from [(14)C]tyrosine injected intracisternally is increased, reaching a maximum in the hypothalamus and striatum 1 hour after administration of morphine. In tolerant rats, the rate of incorporation of carbon-14 into dopamine and into norepinephrine in these areas is more than twice that in animals that have received only one injection of morphine."
https://openalex.org/W2053237334,BENOMYL is the proprietary name of the fungicide in which the active ingredient is benlate (methyl 1-(butyl carbamoyl)-2-benzimidazole carbamate). After extensive trials over the past few years it has been widely reported to be effective in controlling many phytopathogenic fungi and was released for commercial use in 1969. I wish to draw attention to experiments with Aspergillus nidulans which show that benlate radically alters the stability of diploid strains.
https://openalex.org/W1539599514,"The effects of large intraperitoneal doses of fructose and dihydroxyacetone on the levels of many metabolites of carbohydrate metabolism are reported for liver, kidney cortex, and medulla of the rat. Levels were also measured in liver after glycerol and glucose administration, and in kidney cortex and medulla, after glycerol. In both liver and kidney there were large accumulations of fructose-1-P from fructose and of glycero-P from glycerol. The accumulations were associated with marked depletion of ATP, UTP, and total adenylate, and, in liver at least, of Pi. The increases in glycero-P were not associated with comparable changes in dihydroxyacetone-P, and the ratio between the two rose from 18:1 to as high as 1000:1, with relatively minor changes in lactate to pyruvate ratios. Riboflavin deficiency, which drastically lowers glycero-P oxidase activity, caused an increased accumulation of glycero-P. These results suggest that the newly formed glycero-P is chiefly oxidized by glycero-P oxidase rather than by glycero-P dehydrogenase. The disproportionate increase in glycero-P seen after glycerol was also observed after fructose administration in kidney cortex but not in liver. In the case of each of the four nutrients, fructose, dihydroxyacetone, glycerol, and glucose, UDP-glucose decreased in liver. Concomitantly, metabolites of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway increased. The increases tended to be smaller for fructose 1,6-diphosphate and dihydroxyacetone-P than for members above and below them on the pathway. The increases were generally greatest after fructose and least after glucose. Fructose caused rapid large increases in glucose but there was little glycogen formation during the first hour."

Evidence is presented for the interference by allopurinol of the de novo biosynthesis of uridine 5'-phosphate in man.
https://openalex.org/W2076955326,"The rate of disappearance of intracisternally administered tritiated norepinephrine from rat brain is decreased after a single dose of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. During long-term administration of imipramine, however, the rate of disappearance of tritiated norepinephrine from brain gradually increases, and there is a concurrent decrease in the content of endogenous norepinephrine in brain. These findings may help to explain why antidepressant effects are observed clinically only after long-termn treatment with imipramine."

https://openalex.org/W1573100887,"Abstract Monoribosomes deficient in messenger RNA which accumulate in a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant at the restrictive temperature were compared for their dissociability in 0.8 m KCl with polyribosomes and with monoribosomes derived from polyribosomes by ribonuclease treatment. It was found that ribosomes from yeast are dissociated into subunits in 0.8 m KCl only if they lack attached messenger RNA. Ribosomes lacking messenger RNA can be converted to a KCl-stable form by incubation in vitro with transfer RNA, polyuridylic acid, and supernatant."

https://openalex.org/W1565906964,"Abstract The enzymatic oxygenation and cleavage of quercetin by quercetinase, an oxygenase produced by Aspergillus flavus, yield carbon monoxide and a depside, 2-protocatechuoyl-phloroglucinolcarboxylic acid. The enzyme does not incorporate from 18O2 into carbon monoxide, but incorporates both atoms of 18O2 into the depside. One atom of 18O2 is incorporated into the carboxyl group and the other into the ester carbonyl; thus quercetinase is a dioxygenase. Oxygen from H218O is not incorporated into either the depside or carbon monoxide. Both the carbon and of carbon monoxide are derived from the hydroxylated carbon 3 of quercetin. The reaction probably involves a direct and concerted addition of activated oxygen to quercetin at positions 2 and 4 to form an unstable cyclic peroxide intermediate which rapidly decomposes to give the products."
https://openalex.org/W2002960456,"The major metabolite of (-)-trans-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol observed in vivo and formed by hepatic microsomes in vitro is 11-hydroxy-trans-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol. The metabolite was identified spectroscopically and was synthesized from trans-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol. In tests with rats, the metabolite produced behavioral effects similar to those imparted by Delta(8)- and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol."
https://openalex.org/W1541077465,"Fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle and creatine phosphokinase activity was measured; 0.2 to 1.16 units of creatine-P kinase per mg of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum protein were found. The activity was inhibited by dinitrofluorobenzene, a known inhibitor of creatine-P kinase, and had Km values similar to those measured for crystalline enzyme. Since the activity diasppeared from the supernatant upon centrifugation, the creatinine-P kinase is bound to the membranous fraction of the fragmented microsomal preparation. However, it was not present on the mitochondrial fraction from the same muscle homogenate. The creatine-P kinase of the fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum preparation represents approximately 1% of the total activity in muscle and may be significant as a localized source of ATP for calcium transport processes during muscle relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W1556776935,"Abstract Translational control of polypeptide synthesis was measured with ribosomal preparations obtained from brain tissue from mice of various ages. Ribosomal cell-free reaction mixtures were employed to measure the relative activities of the monomeric ribonucleoprotein particles during early neural development. Cell-free protein synthesis was markedly reduced during the first few days after birth and by 18 days of age the incorporation of amino acids was diminished by 10-fold. This over-all loss in protein synthesis was shown to be the result of an alteration of both the pH 5 enzyme fractions and the ribosomes themselves. The relative inability of ribosomes from more mature brain tissue to participate in polypeptide synthesis was independent of available template RNA or ribonuclease activity. Despite the loss in synthetic activity, RNA to protein ratios and sucrose gradient profiles of young and more mature ribosomal preparations were very similar."

https://openalex.org/W1586184805,"Calcitonin was extracted from the ultimobranchial gland of salmon in quantities sufficient to permit purification and chemical characterization. The partially purified extract was subjected to gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. Purification was monitored by bioassay of column effluents against a standard prepared from the starting material. These methods led to detection of two chemically different forms of the hormone. One form, present in higher yield, was shown to be pure by several chemical criteria. This major component of the hormone contained 32 amino acids, but differed markedly in amino acid composition from the previously characterized mammalian calcitonins. The minor component was similar in biological potency to the major peptide but was less basic and showed several other differences in amino acid composition. Both forms of the salmon hormone have the highest specific biological activity of any natural calcitonin thus far described (2,700 MRC units per mg in the rat and 50,000 MRC units per mg in the mouse). These properties of the salmon hormone—high specific biological activity and distinctive chemical features—indicate that it may be useful in the study of structure-function relationships in the calcitonins."
https://openalex.org/W2038296702,"At the very beginnings of science
the striking dissimilarities between the
behavior of living and nonliving things
became obvious. Two tendencies can
be discerned in the attempts to arrive
at a unified view of our world. One
tendency is to use the living organism
as the model system. This tendency is
exemplified by Aristotle. For him, the
son of a physician and. the keen observer
of many forms of life, it was
obvious that things develop according
to plans. Every animal and plant is
generated in some definite way, runs
through a cycle of development in
which it unfolds its inherent plan, and
succumbs to death and decay. For
Aristotle, this very obvious feature of
the world which surrounds us is the
model for understanding our (sublunar)
world. Astronomy is the exception
and offers the contrast of an eternal
periodic system subject to neither
generation nor decay."

https://openalex.org/W2365014680,"Abstract A proteinase has been isolated from culture filtrates of Aeromonas proteolytica essentially free of the aminopeptidase activity that is present in spent media from this organism. Sedimentation and moving boundary electrophoretic experiments indicated a high degree of homogeneity for the enzyme, which was isoelectric at approximately pH 3.5. The proteinase had a sedimentation coefficient of 3.50 S, a diffusion coefficient (d020,w) of 8.52 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, and a partial specific volume, calculated from the amino acid composition, of 0.709 cm3 g-1. From both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium, the molecular weight was 34,800; calculations of minimum molecular weight on the basis of zinc content yielded a value near 33,800 which indicated the presence of 1 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme. Amino acid analysis revealed approximately 316 residues."

https://openalex.org/W1501045602,"Abstract Acid-soluble proteins were extracted from purified chromatin of eggs, gastrula embryos, and sperm of the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata. The results of disc electrophoresis and amino acid analysis indicate that embryo and sperm extracts resemble mammalian histones whereas acid-soluble proteins from chromatin of unfertilized eggs differ in several respects from mammalian histones. Histones change during development from egg to gastrula from a lysine-rich to a relatively arginine-rich form. Embryos developing in the presence of actinomycin incorporated 14C-valine into cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins at rates similar to those of control embryos during the first 13 hours of development. The specific activity of the cytoplasmic proteins and of nonchromosomal nuclear proteins was about one-fourth that of whole nuclear proteins. These results indicate that chromosomal proteins are the most rapidly synthesized cellular components in early embryogenesis. At least part of this synthesis depends on new mRNA transcribed after fertilization. The incorporation of valine into lysine-rich histones was inhibited by actinomycin, whereas its incorporation into arginine-rich histones was increased 3- to 4-fold by actinomycin. The synthesis of other histone fractions was unaffected by the drug. The facilitated production of certain histone fractions in the presence of actinomycin suggests that normal synthetic rates of embryogenic proteins are maintained in the absence of new mRNA by means of increased production of some proteins, while others are inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1491952543,"Abstract ATP-RNA adenylyltransferase was isolated from the 80,000 x g pellet of Pseudomonas putida. The enzyme specifically catalyzed the incorporation of AMP from ATP into a polymeric product. The Km for ATP was 3 x 10-4 m. The rate of incorporation of CMP from CTP was about 7% that of AMP, while GTP, UTP, dATP, and ADP were not utilized by the enzyme. The reaction was dependent upon the cofactor, magnesium ion (Km = 3 x 10-2 m), which could neither be replaced nor supplemented by manganese ion. The polymerization reaction, which was accompanied by the stoichiometric release of inorganic pyrophosphate, was dependent upon exogenous RNA. This requirement could be satisfied by ribosomal RNA, soluble RNA, poly C, and (Ap)3A while DNA, poly A, poly I, poly U, (Ap)2A, ApA, and (Ap)4 were ineffective. The Km for ribosomal RNA was 6 x 10-9 m and the Km for soluble RNA was 1 x 10-6 m. Ribosomal RNA functioned in the reaction by acting as a primer upon which adenylate residues were added. The polymeric product was shown to be a chain of adenylate residues, greater than 100 nucleotides in length, covalently attached to the ribosomal RNA. In addition to its role as a primer in the reaction, ribosomal RNA also appeared to act as a kinetic effector."
https://openalex.org/W2007833166,"THE activity of glutathione reductase (GR) in erythrocytes deficient in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is approximately 1.5 to 2 times higher than in red cells with normal G6PD activity1. This may provide a compensatory mechanism for the defect in glutathione reduction in G6PD deficient cells. The cause of the increased activity of GR in G6PD deficiency is unknown and the possibility of increased production of GR in erythrocyte precursors of G6PD deficient individuals seems unlikely. The lower mean red cell age, resulting from a moderately shortened life span of G6PD deficient erythrocytes2, may play a part but is unlikely to account entirely for the marked increase in GR activity. Recently Beutler3 reported a stimulation of erythrocyte GR in normal subjects by flavin–adenine dinucleotide (FAD) in vitro and by supplementation of its precursor riboflavin in vivo. GR activity was shown to depend on dietary intake of riboflavin, but even in persons with a relatively high intake of this vitamin GR does not seem to be saturated with FAD4. These findings suggest that differences of FAD binding of GR may provide an explanation for the increased GR activity in G6PD deficient red cells."

https://openalex.org/W2146417502,"Abstract We have determined the amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptides which comprise the NH2-terminal 34 residues of a heavy chain from a pathological γG1 immunoglobulin (Ca). The tryptic peptides were aligned to give maximum identity with the NH2-terminal regions of three other immunoglobulin heavy chains, one belonging to the γM class and designated as Ou and two belonging to the γG1 class designated as Daw and Eu. In comparing the NH2-terminal regions of Ca with Eu, 26 of the 34 residues are identical. When Ca is compared with Daw or Ou, only 10 of the 34 residues are identical. These findings support the idea that subgroups exist in the variable regions of heavy chains."

https://openalex.org/W2116126062,"Abstract Chromatium cytochrome c552 contains two covalently linked hemes and one tightly bound flavin. The optical rotatory dispersion of the oxidized, reduced, and carbon monoxide-reduced forms of the cytochrome was studied between 185 and 600 nm. It showed a rather featureless optical rotatory dispersion in the visible and aromatic regions but large anomalous rotations with a prominent peak flanked by two small troughs in the Soret region. Reduction or reaction with carbon monoxide increased the magnitude of rotation at the positive extremum, accompanied by a general sharpening of the optical rotatory dispersion profile. Analysis of these dispersion curves gave a set of Cotton effects of opposite signs. In the oxidized form, four Cotton effects were resolved from the dispersion curve and were located at 426.4, 416.1, 406.1, and 360.6 nm with rotational strengths of -0.25, -0.24, +0.55, and -0.07 Debye magneton, respectively. The net rotational strength of these Cotton effects approximated zero. Similar results were obtained in the reduced form which had transitions at 420.6(-), 413.4(+), and 347.2 nm(-), and in the carbon monoxide-reacted form with transitions at 416.6(-), 412.0(+), 410.2(+), and 342.1 nm(-). The Kronig-Kramer transform computed for each form of the cytochrome gave a split circular dichroic spectrum comparable to that experimentally observed. These results could possibly mean that (a) coupled heme interaction might exist in the molecule, (b) the immediate environment of the prosthetic groups might be affected by the oxidation state of the hemes or their reaction with carbon monoxide, and (c) the sharing of the carbon monoxide by the two hemes might not be exactly equal."
