https://openalex.org/W2104431737,"The colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) is a key regulator of myeloid lineage cells. Genetic loss of the CSF1R blocks the normal population of resident microglia in the brain that originates from the yolk sac during early development. However, the role of CSF1R signaling in microglial homeostasis in the adult brain is largely unknown. To this end, we tested the effects of selective CSF1R inhibitors on microglia in adult mice. Surprisingly, extensive treatment results in elimination of ∼99% of all microglia brain-wide, showing that microglia in the adult brain are physiologically dependent upon CSF1R signaling. Mice depleted of microglia show no behavioral or cognitive abnormalities, revealing that microglia are not necessary for these tasks. Finally, we discovered that the microglia-depleted brain completely repopulates with new microglia within 1 week of inhibitor cessation. Microglial repopulation throughout the CNS occurs through proliferation of nestin-positive cells that then differentiate into microglia."
https://openalex.org/W2024694517,"Synapses store information by long-lasting modifications of their structure and molecular composition, but the precise chronology of these changes has not been studied at single-synapse resolution in real time. Here we describe the spatiotemporal reorganization of postsynaptic substructures during long-term potentiation (LTP) at individual dendritic spines. Proteins translocated to the spine in four distinct patterns through three sequential phases. In the initial phase, the actin cytoskeleton was rapidly remodeled while active cofilin was massively transported to the spine. In the stabilization phase, cofilin formed a stable complex with F-actin, was persistently retained at the spine, and consolidated spine expansion. In contrast, the postsynaptic density (PSD) was independently remodeled, as PSD scaffolding proteins did not change their amount and localization until a late protein synthesis-dependent third phase. Our findings show how and when spine substructures are remodeled during LTP and explain why synaptic plasticity rules change over time."
https://openalex.org/W2016756702,"Subsynaptic structures such as bouton, active zone, postsynaptic density (PSD) and dendritic spine, are highly correlated in their dimensions and also correlate with synapse strength. Why this is so and how such correlations are maintained during synaptic plasticity remains poorly understood. We induced spine enlargement by two-photon glutamate uncaging and examined the relationship between spine, PSD, and bouton size by two-photon time-lapse imaging and electron microscopy. In enlarged spines the PSD-associated protein Homer1c increased rapidly, whereas the PSD protein PSD-95 increased with a delay and only in cases of persistent spine enlargement. In the case of nonpersistent spine enlargement, the PSD proteins remained unchanged or returned to their original level. The ultrastructure at persistently enlarged spines displayed matching dimensions of spine, PSD, and bouton, indicating their correlated enlargement. This supports a model in which balancing of synaptic structures is a hallmark for the stabilization of structural modifications during synaptic plasticity."

We used genetically encoded Ca2+ and glutamate indicators as well as pharmacogenetic and electrical control of neurotransmitter release to explore astrocyte activity in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway. Our data revealed numerous localized, spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocyte branches and territories, but these were not driven by neuronal activity or glutamate. Moreover, evoked astrocyte Ca2+ signaling changed linearly with the number of mossy fiber action potentials. Under these settings, astrocyte responses were global, suppressed by neurotransmitter clearance, and mediated by glutamate and GABA. Thus, astrocyte engagement in the fully developed mossy fiber pathway was slow and territorial, contrary to that frequently proposed for astrocytes within microcircuits. We show that astrocyte Ca2+ signaling functionally segregates large volumes of neuropil and that these transients are not suited for responding to, or regulating, single synapses in the mossy fiber pathway.

Important progress has been made in understanding the roles of glia in the brain since their discovery over a century ago and following landmark physiological studies (Kuffler, 1967Kuffler S.W. Neuroglial cells: physiological properties and a potassium mediated effect of neuronal activity on the glial membrane potential.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1967; 168: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Astrocytes (a subclass of glia) are known to display dynamic intracellular Ca2+ signals (Agulhon et al., 2008Agulhon C. Petravicz J. McMullen A.B.

Liaudet N. Bhaukaurally K. Santello M. Bouvier D. Tiret P. Volterra A. Local Ca2+ detection and modulation of synaptic release by astrocytes.Nat.

In these settings, astrocytes respond to single synapse glutamate release by exhibiting localized intracellular Ca2+ elevations in their main processes a few micrometers from the soma, implying that they are actively involved in microcircuit function (Di Castro et al., 2011Di Castro M.A. Chuquet J. Liaudet N. Bhaukaurally K. Santello M. Bouvier D. Tiret P. Volterra A. Local Ca2+ detection and modulation of synaptic release by astrocytes.Nat.

However, abolishing one major form of intracellular Ca2+ signal within astrocytes was without obvious consequence for neuronal function (Agulhon et al., 2010Agulhon C. Fiacco T.A. McCarthy K.D.

To understand these differences, one needs to explore when astrocytes become excited within neuronal circuits, but this has proven challenging. Unlike neurons, astrocytes are not electrically excitable and evaluations have had to rely on imaging. In particular, available imaging methods that use organic Ca2+ indicator dyes are not ideal for monitoring astrocyte branches, which are the primary sites for interactions with neurons (Reeves et al., 2011Reeves A.M.

Genetically encoded calcium indicators and astrocyte calcium microdomains.Neuroscientist. 2013; 19: 274-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As a result, the function of astrocyte Ca2+ signaling within neuronal circuits remains incompletely explored (Tong et al., 2013Tong X. Shigetomi E. Looger L.L. Khakh B.S. Genetically encoded calcium indicators and astrocyte calcium microdomains.Neuroscientist. 2013; 19: 274-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have refined optical and genetic tools in order to study astrocyte branches and territories by building on recent progress with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) (Tian et al., 2012Tian L. Akerboom J. Schreiter E.R. Looger L.L. Neural activity imaging with genetically encoded calcium indicators.Prog. Brain Res. 2012; 196: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). GECIs are not a panacea, and they have effects such as Ca2+ buffering that are shared with organic dyes. However, under most circumstances they do not obviously perturb neurons or astrocytes and are complementary to other approaches (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R.

To image cytosolic and near-membrane Ca2+, we used astrocyte-specific expression of cytosolic GCaMP3 or membrane-targeted Lck-GCaMP3, respectively (Shigetomi et al., 2010Shigetomi E. Kracun S.

To directly image astrocyte cell-surface glutamate signals, we used a genetically encoded glutamate sensor (Marvin et al., 2013Marvin J.S. Borghuis B.G. Tian L. Cichon J. Harnett M.T. Akerboom J. Gordus A. Renninger S.L. Chen T.W. Bargmann C.I. et al.An optimized fluorescent probe for visualizing glutamate neurotransmission.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) (iGluSnFR). We also used GCaMP6f, a recent GECI with kinetics similar to the organic Ca2+ indicator dye OGB1-AM (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar). In order to drive neurotransmitter release selectively from the mossy fiber pathway, we generated novel BAC transgenic “SPRAE” mice that express a drug-activated ion channel within the mossy fiber pathway. Using these optical and pharmacogenetic tools, we explored astrocyte signaling in the circuit formed by the dentate gyrus granule cell projection (the mossy fiber pathway) to the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Amaral and Lavenex, 2007Amaral D. Lavenex P. Hippocampal neuroanatomy.in: Andersen P. Morris R. Amaral D. Bliss T. O’Keefe J. The Hippocampus Book, Chapter 3. Oxford University Press, Oxford2007: 37-114Google Scholar). We chose this circuit because mossy fibers are the only feed-forward excitatory input to the anatomically well-defined CA3 region of the stratum lucidum (s.l.) (Amaral and Lavenex, 2007Amaral D.

Additionally, the anatomical relationship between mossy fibers and postsynaptic neuronal and astrocytic targets has been described by electron microscopy (Rollenhagen and Lübke, 2006Rollenhagen A.

We deployed several imaging tools to study astrocytes located in the s.l. of the adult mouse hippocampus (∼P70). The slices were ∼300 μm thick, and the imaged astrocytes were located ∼40 μm from the slice surface. The experiments were conducted at room temperature (∼21°C) or close to mouse body temperature (34°C), as indicated. The imaging was performed using laser scanning confocal microscopy with a 40× objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.8. The effective pixel size was 0.2 × 0.2 μm, which is larger than the size of astrocyte branchlets at <100 nm. We could not reliably load hippocampal astrocytes from adult mice with organic Ca2+ indicator dyes. By extending tool development work that showed GCaMP3 is well suited to study astrocytes from adult mice (Shigetomi et al., 2013aShigetomi E. Bushong E.A. Haustein M.D. Tong X. Jackson-Weaver O.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10143-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we used it, Lck-GCaMP3, and GCaMP6f to explore s.l. astrocyte intracellular Ca2+ signals. For selective expression within astrocytes, we used adeno-associated viruses of the 2/5 serotype (AAV 2/5) and the astrocyte-specific gfaABC1D promoter (Shigetomi et al., 2013aShigetomi E. Bushong E.A. Haustein M.D. Tong X. Jackson-Weaver O. Kracun S. Xu J. Sofroniew M.V. Ellisman M.H. Khakh B.S.

Physiol. 2013; 141: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). GECIs were innocuously expressed within large parts of s.l. astrocyte territories, including their branches. Furthermore, AAV2/5-mediated expression of fluorescent proteins does not alter spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocytes (Shigetomi et al., 2013aShigetomi E. Bushong E.A. Haustein M.D. Tong X.

All of the GECIs we used display Ca2+ affinities (∼0.3 μM) similar to organic dyes often used to study astrocytes. High numbers of Ca2+ signals were observed within s.l. astrocytes expressing GCaMP3 (Movie S1 available online; Figures 2B–2D) (n = 13 astrocytes). Eleven ROIs from an astrocyte are shown in Figures 2A and 2C, illustrating that the soma was relatively silent and that numerous Ca2+ signals occurred in branches. Ca2+ signals in the somata and branches displayed similar amplitudes and second’s time scale kinetics (Figure 2B; Table S1). However, ∼8-fold greater numbers of Ca2+ signals were measured within branches than in somata (Figure 2B). Such Ca2+ signals originated from, and were of similar amplitude within, entire territories of single astrocytes (Figure 2D; n = 13 cells). The greatest numbers were detected ∼15 μm from the soma (Figure 2D), perhaps reflecting a region of high astrocyte branching or a larger cytosolic volume per branch at this region. These possibilities cannot be discriminated by light microscopy, and further detailed work employing correlated light and electron microscopy is needed. However, the observed result is not due to fortuitous accumulation of GCaMP3 at ∼15 μm (Figure 1H; n = 10 cells). To determine if fast Ca2+ signals existed in s.l. astrocytes, we used 200 Hz line scan imaging (Figure 2E; n = 10). A representative line scan lasting ∼170 s is shown in Figure 2F, and a branch region is expanded and plotted as a trace (Figure 2G). Ca2+ signals were clearly seen; we repeated the analyses for ten astrocytes and measured transient properties in branches and somata (Figures 2H–2J). These data show that on average the fastest Ca2+ signals last ∼3 s, which is consistent with the frame scan data (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S1). We also performed a specific set of experiments on single astrocytes to measure astrocyte Ca2+ signals at room temperature and then at 34°C. In these pairwise comparisons, we noted significant changes in the properties of Ca2+ signals at warmer temperatures, including acceleration of kinetics in somata, as expected. However, overall the Ca2+ signals still lasted seconds (Table S2; n = 7). Is it possible that fast Ca2+ signals were missed with GCaMP3? To address this, we repeated experiments shown in Figure 2 by using GCaMP6f, which displays rapid kinetics and high sensitivity (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar). GCaMP6f displays larger peak fluorescence changes compared to GCaMP3 (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar), and in accord, using GCaMP6f astrocyte, spontaneous Ca2+ signals were 3-fold larger, and we observed twice as many ROIs with Ca2+ signals in the branches (Table S1; n = 14). However, the Ca2+ signals detected by GCaMP6f still lasted several seconds (Table S1). It is conceivable that cytosolic GECIs may miss Ca2+ signals in fine processes. To explore this, we used Lck-GCaMP3, which better reports near-membrane Ca2+ signals within fine processes (Shigetomi et al., 2013aShigetomi E. Bushong E.A. Haustein M.D. Tong X. Jackson-Weaver O. Kracun S. Xu J. Sofroniew M.V. Ellisman M.H. Khakh B.S. Imaging calcium microdomains within entire astrocyte territories and endfeet with GCaMPs expressed using adeno-associated viruses.J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 141: 633-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, we found that expression of Lck-GCaMP3 within s.l. astrocytes reported fewer spontaneous Ca2+ signals than GCaMP3 (Table S1; n = 12), even though it was expressed within territory areas larger than GCaMP3 (Figure 1C). These data indicate that s.l. astrocytes do not display a significant number of near-membrane Ca2+ signals in fine processes. We further explored these possibilities in subsequent experiments, but taken together, these data suggest that s.l. astrocytes are different from stratum radiatum (s.r.) astrocytes (Shigetomi et al., 2013bShigetomi E. Jackson-Weaver O. Huckstepp R.T. O’Dell T.J. Khakh B.S. TRPA1 channels are regulators of astrocyte basal calcium levels and long-term potentiation via constitutive D-serine release.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10143-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) in that fewer signals are mediated by near-membrane Ca2+ dynamics in the s.l. region. This implies diverse astrocyte properties and functions within subfields of the hippocampus. Given the tight association of astrocyte branches and excitatory synapses in the s.l. region (Rollenhagen et al., 2007Rollenhagen A. Sätzler K. Rodríguez E.P. Jonas P. Frotscher M. Lübke J.H. Structural determinants of transmission at large hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10434-10444Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we determined if astrocyte Ca2+ signals (Figure 2) were driven by release of glutamate, either tonically or that evoked by action potential firing. We found that application of 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX), to block action potentials, produced no statistically significant change in Ca2+ signal dF/F, frequency, or kinetics in somata or branches (Figure 3A; average data in Figures S1A and S1B; n = 10). Moreover, we found that spontaneous somatic and branch Ca2+ signal amplitudes, frequency, and kinetics were not significantly reduced by mGluR5, mGluR2/3, or NMDA receptor antagonists (50 μM MPEP, 10 μM LY341495, and 50 μM APV, respectively) (Figures 3B, 3C, 3D, and S1C–S1H; n = 10 in each case). These reagents also did not markedly change the basal fluorescence of the astrocytes (Figures S1I–S1L). However, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with 20 μM cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) for 25 min significantly (>70%) reduced the numbers of Ca2+ signals in astrocyte somata and branches, thus pointing to their intracellular origin (Figure 3E; Figures S2A and S2B; n = 5). As expected, CPA significantly elevated the basal fluorescence of astrocytes (Figure S1M). We next used IP3R2 knockout mice (Agulhon et al., 2010Agulhon C. Fiacco T.A. McCarthy K.D. Hippocampal short- and long-term plasticity are not modulated by astrocyte Ca2+ signaling.Science. 2010; 327: 1250-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, Petravicz et al., 2008Petravicz J. Fiacco T.A. McCarthy K.D. Loss of IP3 receptor-dependent Ca2+ increases in hippocampal astrocytes does not affect baseline CA1 pyramidal neuron synaptic activity.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4967-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) to explore the role of this channel in controlling release of Ca2+ from stores. Recalling the CPA data, we found that the IP3R2 KO mice displayed significantly reduced numbers of Ca2+ signals compared to wild-type (WT) littermates (by ∼60%) (Figure 3F; Figures S2C and S2D; n = 9 cells). Unexpectedly, the use of GECIs in the IP3R2 KO mice revealed residual Ca2+ signals in s.l. astrocyte somata and mainly in branches (Figures S2C and S2D). Thus, although Ca2+ signals are reduced in number in the IP3R2 KO mice, they are not abolished when GECIs are deployed to image entire astrocyte territories. Interestingly, the residual Ca2+ signals in s.l. astrocytes were not blocked by HC 030031 (Figures S2E and S2F; n = 8), a selective antagonist for TRPA1 channels. In contrast, functional TRPA1 channels are expressed and mediate significant Ca2+ signals within s.r. astrocytes (Shigetomi et al., 2013bShigetomi E. Jackson-Weaver O. Huckstepp R.T. O’Dell T.J. Khakh B.S. TRPA1 channels are regulators of astrocyte basal calcium levels and long-term potentiation via constitutive D-serine release.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 10143-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We considered it important to selectively drive glutamate release from mossy fiber terminals in order to explore astrocyte signaling. As part of an unrelated project (Richler et al., 2008Richler E. Chaumont S. Shigetomi E. Sagasti A. Khakh B.S. Tracking transmitter-gated P2X cation channel activation in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we created BAC transgenic mice expressing fluorescently tagged P2X2 receptors (P2X2-YC; YC is Yellow Cameleon 3.1) (Figures S3A–S3C) within mossy fibers, prompting us to characterize and exploit this novel pharmacogenetic tool. P2X2 receptors are cell-surface ATP-gated cation channels that can be activated by synthetic ATP congeners (e.g., ATPγS). P2X2 receptors enter presynaptic terminals and axons, where their activation increases neurotransmitter release (Khakh and North, 2012Khakh B.S. North R.A. Neuromodulation by extracellular ATP and P2X receptors in the CNS.Neuron. 2012; 76: 51-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In light of this, we dubbed the mice with mossy fiber expression as “SPRAE” mice, an acronym for Selective P2X Receptor Axoterminal Excitation mice. As reported below, their activation triggered neurotransmitter release from mossy fibers, “spraying” the s.l. region with glutamate. We found remarkably specific P2X2-YC expression within mossy fibers of SPRAE mice (Figure 4A), but not in WT mice (Figures S3D and S3E; n = 5). Striking expression was observed in the mossy fiber pathway, particularly within the terminal regions located in the s.l. (Figures S3G–S3I). We also evaluated the basic properties of granule cells from SPRAE mice in comparison to WT littermates and found no obvious differences (Figures S4A and S4B; n = 15–31). However, despite the absence of detectable P2X2-YC immunostaining within granule cell bodies, we did detect small somatic P2X2-YC-mediated currents in SPRAE mice (Figures S4C and S4D; n = 15–23; Figures S4E and S4F; n = 5 and 7). Overall, SPRAE mice display P2X2-YC expression in the mossy fibers, a feature we exploited to drive neurotransmitter release. Mossy fiber boutons form synapses with CA3 pyramidal neurons via thorny excrescence spines in the s.l. (Amaral and Lavenex, 2007Amaral D. Lavenex P. Hippocampal neuroanatomy.in: Andersen P. Morris R.

By monitoring glutamate mediated miniature (i.e., spontaneous) excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) onto CA3 pyramidal neurons (in 0.5 μM TTX), we found that application of drug to activate P2X2-YC channels (ATPγS; 100 μM) dramatically increased their frequency. Similar responses were never observed in WT mice (Figure 4B). The large frequency increase made it difficult to measure all mEPSCs individually (Figure 4C), prompting us to measure charge transfer (nC). We measured charge transfer (nC) in 2 s bins during 30 min recordings before, during and after drug applications for SPRAE and WT mice (Figure 4D), revealing that ATPγS robustly triggered the release of glutamate onto pyramidal neurons from SPRAE mice but had no effect in WT mice (Figure 4D; n = 11 and 8). In seven out of eleven cells in the presence of TTX (0.5 μM) and Cd2+ (100 μM; Figure S4G; n = 11), all mEPSCs could be measured individually (in four cells they"

However, an understanding of the functional role of higher auditory cortical areas in guiding attention to acoustic stimuli has been elusive. We recorded from neurons in two tonotopic cortical belt areas in the dorsal posterior ectosylvian gyrus (dPEG) of ferrets trained on a simple auditory discrimination task. Neurons in dPEG showed similar basic auditory tuning properties to A1, but during behavior we observed marked differences between these areas. In the belt areas, changes in neuronal firing rate and response dynamics greatly enhanced responses to target stimuli relative to distractors, allowing for greater attentional selection during active listening. Consistent with existing anatomical evidence, the pattern of sensory tuning and behavioral modulation in auditory belt cortex links the spectrotemporal representation of the whole acoustic scene in A1 to a more abstracted representation of task-relevant stimuli observed in frontal cortex."

Finally, Lhx6 directly binds in vivo to an Arx enhancer and to an intronic CXCR7 enhancer that remains active in mature interneurons.

These findings provide a clear example of how a simple synaptic mechanism can repurpose a neural circuit to perform diverse computations. The array of neural computations required to explain behavior is far too large to be explained by specialized single-function neural circuits. Instead, the computation performed by a neural circuit often changes as task demands change. Such repurposing has been studied extensively in motor control. Neuromodulators, for example, alter central pattern generator circuits so that common circuit components participate in multiple motor rhythms (Marder and Bucher, 2007Marder E. Bucher D. Understanding circuit dynamics using the stomatogastric nervous system of lobsters and crabs.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 291-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Although similar functional repurposing occurs in circuits throughout the central nervous system, we know much less about the underlying mechanisms. The optic nerve of the mammalian retina contains the axons of ∼20 subtypes of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The neuronal organization of the retina.Neuron. 2012; 76: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), through which all visual information is transmitted to the brain. These same RGCs provide the basis for visually guided behavior under lighting conditions ranging from the darkest night to the brightest day. As the demands of the visual environment change, the computations performed by retinal circuits change correspondingly. Some functional properties of RGCs, like gain (Shapley and Enroth-Cugell, 1984Shapley R. Enroth-Cugell C. Progress in Retinal Research. Volume 3. Pergamon, London1984: 263-346Google Scholar), receptive field size (Barlow et al., 1957Barlow H.B. Fitzhugh R. Kuffler S.W. Change of organization in the receptive fields of the cat’s retina during dark adaptation.J. Physiol. 1957; 137: 338-354PubMed Google Scholar), and center/surround ratio (Enroth-Cugell and Lennie, 1975Enroth-Cugell C. Lennie P. The control of retinal ganglion cell discharge by receptive field surrounds.J. Physiol. 1975; 247: 551-578PubMed Google Scholar), change with the statistics of the visual environment; other properties have traditionally been considered immutable and correspondingly are often used to classify RGCs into specific types. On versus Off response polarity and direction selectivity are examples of these more stable functional properties, though recent work has disputed the immutability of even these properties (Geffen et al., 2007Geffen M.N. de Vries S.E. Meister M. Retinal ganglion cells can rapidly change polarity from Off to On.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, Rivlin-Etzion et al., 2012Rivlin-Etzion M. Wei W. Feller M.B. Visual stimulation reverses the directional preference of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 2012; 76: 518-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we show that another property commonly used to classify RGCs—linear versus nonlinear spatial integration of visual signals contained within their receptive field (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966Enroth-Cugell C. Robson J.G. The contrast sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells of the cat.J. Physiol. 1966; 187: 517-552PubMed Google Scholar)—can change with the visual environment. While functional properties of retinal circuits can change rapidly, the underlying circuit wiring is likely fixed over the course of an ∼1-hr-long physiology experiment. Thus, rapid functional changes arise from light-dependent changes in the operation of common circuit elements. We find here that tonic input via gap junctions controls the rectification of the dominant excitatory synapse onto RGCs. This tonic input changes with luminance, and the resulting change in synaptic rectification controls whether ganglion cells integrate inputs across space linearly or nonlinearly. More generally, this work illustrates how fine control of the synaptic operating point, in this case via dendro-axonal gap junctions, can control key computational features of a neural circuit. We used a flat mount preparation of the mouse retina to characterize how RGCs integrate light inputs across space. By mounting the isolated retina flat in a recording chamber, we could deliver spatially patterned light stimuli to the photoreceptors while measuring the resulting RGC responses. We focused on On alpha RGCs, a physiologically and anatomically well-characterized ganglion cell type (Pang et al., 2003Pang J.J. Gao F. Wu S.M.

Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The spatial dependence of RGC responses was measured using a classic stimulus paradigm designed to characterize cells as linear (“X” cells) or nonlinear (“Y” cells) integrators over space (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966Enroth-Cugell C. Robson J.G. The contrast sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells of the cat.J. Physiol. 1966; 187: 517-552PubMed Google Scholar, Victor and Shapley, 1979Victor J.D. Shapley R.M. The nonlinear pathway of Y ganglion cells in the cat retina.J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 74: 671-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A split-field stimulus with regions of equal positive and negative contrast was modulated sinusoidally in time (at 3.75 Hz) so that the light and dark regions changed sides periodically (Figure 1A). When the light and dark regions of the stimulus each cover exactly half of the receptive field center, linear spatial integration predicts no modulation of the response because responses to the light and dark regions cancel. Nonlinear spatial integration of the same input would result in incomplete cancellation and a response at twice the modulation frequency (a frequency doubled or “F2” response). RGCs responded at the modulation frequency (an “F1” response) when the border between light and dark regions was far (≥50 μm) from the receptive field center (Figure 1B). These responses were robust at both low (0.25–1 photoisomerizations per rod photoreceptor per second, or R∗/rod/s) (Figure 1A, left) and moderate (≥100 R∗/rod/s) (Figure 1A, right) luminance. However, when the border was centered on the receptive field, responses were weak or nonexistent at low luminance but strong at moderate luminance (F2 responses; see Experimental Procedures). This change from linear to nonlinear spatial integration was evident in both spike responses and excitatory input currents (Figure 1A). We focused on changes in the spatial integration of excitatory inputs from presynaptic bipolar cells, since inhibitory inputs play a minor role in shaping spike responses of these cells under similar stimulus conditions (Murphy and Rieke, 2006Murphy G.J. Rieke F.

Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We quantified nonlinearities in spatial integration from the ratio of the frequency-doubled response to the response at the modulation frequency (i.e., the F2/F1 ratio); this ratio increased by more than a factor of ten across the luminance range tested (Figure 1B) (see Linsenmeier and Jakiela, 1979Linsenmeier R.A. Jakiela H.G. Non-linear spatial summation in cat retinal ganglion cells at different background levels.Exp. Brain Res. 1979; 36: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar for a comparison with cat RGCs). The change in F2/F1 ratio with luminance was highly significant (p = 1 × 10−5; Pearson’s correlation test on log-log scale, n = 19 cells). Nonlinear spatial integration underlies many of the computations of RGCs, including sensitivity to second-order motion (Demb et al., 2001Demb J.B. Zaghloul K. Sterling P. Cellular basis for the response to second-order motion cues in Y retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 2001; 32: 711-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), differential motion of object and background (Gollisch and Meister, 2010Gollisch T. Meister M. Eye smarter than scientists believed: neural computations in circuits of the retina.Neuron. 2010; 65: 150-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and rotations or small translations of texture patterns within the receptive field center (Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Computations in higher visual areas, like the recognition of form from texture patterns (El-Shamayleh and Movshon, 2011El-Shamayleh Y. Movshon J.A. Neuronal responses to texture-defined form in macaque visual area V2.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 8543-8555Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the demodulation of spatio-temporal patterns (Rosenberg and Issa, 2011Rosenberg A. Issa N.P. The Y cell visual pathway implements a demodulating nonlinearity.Neuron. 2011; 71: 348-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), also depend on nonlinear spatial integration. We found previously that On alpha RGC responses at high luminance depend on the spatial scale of texture stimuli confined to the receptive field center (Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The RGC response was modulated maximally by textures containing spatial scales of ∼40 μm, much smaller than the ∼300 μm diameter of the full receptive field center. Here, we measured the ability of the same On alpha RGCs to encode information about 2D spatial structure within their receptive fields under different luminance conditions. We presented sets of texture patterns with two different levels of spatial blur that we had shown previously to elicit different average responses in the RGC at high luminance (Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C; see Experimental Procedures). At a luminance of 0.5 R∗/rod/s, performance at distinguishing blur levels was not different from chance (55% ± 5% correct; n = 5 cells). The same cells performed substantially better at a mean luminance of 100 R∗/rod/s (86% ± 3%; p = 0.003). Thus, the change from linear to nonlinear spatial integration confers the On alpha RGCs with sensitivity to fine spatial structure, fundamentally altering the type of information these cells extract from a visual scene. Other computations of these RGCs that depend on nonlinear spatial integration should similarly be impaired or absent at low luminance. What circuit mechanisms could cause RGC spatial integration to change with luminance? The bipolar cells that provide excitatory synaptic input to RGCs have much smaller receptive fields (∼40 μm) than the RGCs themselves (∼300 μm) (Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and the On alpha RGC receives synaptic input from hundreds of bipolar cells within its receptive field center. If the bipolar cells report stimulus contrast without rectification (i.e., with equal and opposite responses to positive and negative contrast), inputs from bipolar cells in the dark and light regions of the split-field stimulus would cancel, resulting in linear spatial integration by the RGC. If instead the bipolar cells provide a rectified signal to the RGC, responses from the dark and light regions of the split-field stimulus would not cancel, resulting in nonlinear spatial integration by the RGC (Figures 1C and 1D) (Demb et al., 1999Demb J.B. Haarsma L. Freed M.A. Sterling P. Functional circuitry of the retinal ganglion cell’s nonlinear receptive field.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9756-9767PubMed Google Scholar, Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that excitatory synaptic input to the On alpha RGC is rectified in bright conditions (Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), so we hypothesized that a change in the rectification of bipolar cell input across luminance underlies the observed changes in RGC spatial integration. To test this hypothesis, we measured changes in RGC excitatory synaptic input elicited by increments and decrements of spatially uniform stimuli across a range of luminances (Figure 2). We focused on responses to the step onset since these reflect the adaptational state of the circuit in the prior period of constant light. At low luminance, ±50% contrast steps elicited approximately equal and opposite responses. At higher luminance, the response profile was markedly rectified, with the positive contrast step eliciting a ∼4-fold larger response than the negative contrast step (Figures 2A and 2B). To quantify changes in rectification, we computed a rectification index by dividing the difference between the +50% and −50% contrast responses by their sum (see Experimental Procedures). This index ranges from −1 (negatively rectified) through 0 (nonrectified) to 1 (positively rectified). Rectification increased systematically with increasing luminance (Figure 2C) (p = 1 × 10−10; Pearson’s correlation on log-linear scale, n = 49 cells). Changes in rectification could not be explained as simply a change in dynamic range, since a rescaling of the contrast axis did not produce identical contrast-response curves (Figure S1 available online). The transition in rectification occurred across the same luminance range as the change in F2/F1 ratio (Figure 1B), consistent with changes in synaptic rectification underlying changes in spatial integration (Figure 1D). At low luminance, signals traverse the retina primarily through the rod bipolar circuit, while at higher luminance the cone bipolar circuit also contributes to ganglion cell responses (Figure 3A) (Trexler et al., 2005Trexler E.B. Li W. Massey S.C. Simultaneous contribution of two rod pathways to AII amacrine and cone bipolar cell light responses.J. Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Signals traversing either circuit must pass through the cone bipolar cell → On alpha RGC synapse, regardless of their origin. The sensitivity of these two circuits in darkness has been explored (Deans et al., 2002Deans M.R. Volgyi B. Goodenough D.A. Bloomfield S.A. Paul D.L.

Physiol. 2007; 580: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but their relative contribution at different luminance levels is unclear. Does a transition in signaling between these two circuits contribute to changes in RGC spatial integration? To answer this question, we turned to a retinal slice preparation, allowing better access to bipolar and amacrine cells whose somas reside in the inner nuclear layer (see Experimental Procedures). We then measured signal flow through the rod and cone bipolar circuits across a range of luminances. The AII amacrine cell receives inputs from both the rod and cone bipolar circuits. Signals from rod bipolar cells are transmitted to the AII amacrine cell via glutamatergic synapses, which contain primarily alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (Singer and Diamond, 2003Singer J.H.

In comparison, signals from the cone bipolar circuit are mediated by connexin36 (Cx36)-containing gap junctions between AII amacrine cell dendrites and On cone bipolar cell axon terminals (Figures 3A and 3B) (Deans et al., 2002Deans M.R.

Morigiwa K. Ueda M. Sterling P. Microcircuits for night vision in mouse retina.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8616-8623PubMed Google Scholar). On cone bipolar cells themselves receive dendritic input from cones via metabotropic glutamate receptors. Thus, input to the AII amacrine cell originating from the rod bipolar circuit can be selectively eliminated by the AMPAR antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), effectively isolating input from the cone bipolar circuit (i.e., the NBQX-insensitive component) (Figure 3B) (Cohen, 2000Cohen E.D.

We first recorded the combined signals from both circuits in the AII amacrine cell (in response to +100% contrast steps; voltage clamp) at different luminance levels. We then repeated these measurements in the presence of NBQX to measure signals from the cone bipolar circuit alone (Figures 3C and 3D). These experiments were conducted using retinas from wild-type (WT) and Cx36−/− mice, in which gap junctions in both the inner and outer retina are disrupted (Deans et al., 2002Deans M.R. Volgyi B.

Connexin36 is essential for transmission of rod-mediated visual signals in the mammalian retina.Neuron. 2002; 36: 703-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). At a dim background of 0.5 R∗/rod/s, NBQX eliminated the entire light response in both WT and Cx36−/− retinas, indicating that rod signals are transmitted primarily through the rod bipolar circuit at this luminance, with little or no contribution from rod or cone signals traversing the cone bipolar circuit (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3F). At 100 R∗/rod/s, NBQX again eliminated the entire response in AII amacrine cells from Cx36−/− retinas, but much of the signal in WT retinas remained, indicating that both the rod and cone bipolar circuits normally contributed to the response at this luminance (Figures 3C, 3D, and 3F). The NBQX-insensitive response in WT mice—i.e., the response of the cone bipolar circuit—was half-maximal at a mean luminance of ∼5 R∗/rod/s (Figure 3E) (similar results for current and voltage responses). The experiments of Figures 2 and 3 show that the balance of signal flow through the rod and cone bipolar circuits and the rectification of the RGC excitatory synaptic input have a similar dependence on luminance. Thus, a possible explanation for the change in spatial integration is that the rod and cone bipolar circuits encode contrast differently. We tested this hypothesis by measuring responses to positive and negative contrast steps in AII amacrine cells and type 6 cone bipolar cells (which provide the dominant excitatory input to the On alpha RGC; Schwartz et al., 2012Schwartz G.W. Okawa H. Dunn F.A. Morgan J.L. Kerschensteiner D. Wong R.O. Rieke F. The spatial structure of a nonlinear receptive field.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1572-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) at low luminance (0.5 R∗/rod/s), where input from the rod bipolar circuit dominates, and moderate luminance (100 R∗/rod/s), where both rod and cone bipolar circuits provide sizable input (Figure 4). Voltage responses of both AII amacrine cells (Figures 4A and 4D) and On cone bipolar cells (Figures 4C and 4D) were negatively rectified (i.e., larger responses to negative contrast steps than positive contrast steps) at both low and moderate luminance levels. In comparison, RGC excitatory inputs exhibited near zero rectification at low light levels and became positively rectified as luminance was increased to 100 R∗/rod/s (Figures 4C and 4D; see also Figure 2). These data indicate that the change in rectification of the RGC synaptic inputs does not reflect a basic difference in the rectification of the rod bipolar and cone bipolar circuits. Instead, the change in rectification occurs at the synapse between cone bipolar cells and RGCs, a shared element in the two circuits. Such shared elements provide likely sites for interactions of signals from the two circuits. Changes in the steady-state signals observed in AIIs, cone bipolar cells, and RGCs provided a clue about the interactions responsible for this luminance-dependent change in RGC encoding and synaptic rectification. On alpha RGCs lost excitatory holding current as luminance increased (Figure 4C) (169 ± 57 pA, n = 5 cells, p = 0.04), indicating a reduction in maintained glutamate release from presynaptic cone bipolar cells. AII amacrine cells and type 6 cone bipolar cells hyperpolarized across the same luminance range (ΔVAII = −2.94 ± 0.14 mV, n = 9 cells, p = 1 × 10−4; ΔVCB6 = −4.32 ± 0.33 mV, n = 6 cells, p = 0.003) (Figures 4A, 4B, and 5G ). AII amacrine cells in whole-mount and slice preparations exhibited similar behavior, confirming that this aspect of the inner-retinal network had not been compromised by slicing the retina (Figure S2G). Taken together, these data indicate that the entire gap-junctionally coupled AII-On cone bipolar cell network hyperpolarizes when luminance increases from 0.5 to 100 R∗/rod/s. Paradoxically, the cells of interest (On RGCs, On cone bipolar cells, and AII amacrine cells) are all classified as On cells—they depolarize in response to positive contrast. Hence, we were surprised that maintained light exposure hyperpolarized the presynaptic AII-On cone bipolar electrical network and reduced tonic excitatory input to postsynaptic RGCs. In the following paragraphs we explore the mechanistic origin of the steady-state hyperpolarization before returning to its impact on synaptic rectification and spatial integration. Previous work showed that the transition from low to moderate luminance involves a dramatic reduction in gain of the rod bipolar cell → AII synapse (Dunn et al., 2006Dunn F.A. Doan T. Sampath A.P.

Ribbon synapses compute temporal contrast and encode luminance in retinal rod bipolar cells.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and recruitment of the cone bipolar circuit (Figure 3). Specifically, tonic depolarization of the rod bipolar cell reduces synaptic gain whereas hyperpolarization increases gain. Close proximity of the rod bipolar cell → AII synapses and AII → cone bipolar cell electrical synapses suggests that a local change in AII voltage produced by a change in gain of the rod bipolar synapse will be efficiently relayed to cone bipolar axon terminals (Figure 3A) (Tsukamoto et al., 2001Tsukamoto Y. Morigiwa K. Ueda M. Sterling P. Microcircuits for night vision in mouse retina.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8616-8623PubMed Google Scholar). Is this the case? If so, what synaptic mechanisms are involved? We first compared changes in rod bipolar cell and cone bipolar cell voltage in response to a step in mean luminance from 0.5 to 100 R∗/rod/s. While cone bipolar cells slowly hyperpolarized following the luminance increase (Figures 5B and S2A–S2F), rod bipolar cells depolarized and slowly relaxed to steady state (Figure 5E) (Jarsky et al., 2011Jarsky T. Cembrowski M. Logan S.M. Kath W.L. Riecke H. Demb J.B. Singer J.H. A synaptic mechanism for retinal adaptation to luminance and contrast.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11003-11015Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both cell types maintained their polarity as On cells throughout the change in luminance (Figures 5C and 5F), despite their opposing changes in resting membrane potential (ΔVCB = −4.34 ± 0.26 mV, n = 10 cells, p = 6 × 10−4; ΔVRB = +7.26 ± 0.49 mV, n = 9 cells, p = 5 × 10−4) (Figure 5G). Somatic cone bipolar cell recordings reflect a superposition of axonal input from AIIs (via gap junctions) and dendritic input through mGluR6 receptors. If dendritic input to rod and cone bipolar cells exhibit similar kinetics, the slow hyperpolarization of the cone bipolar cell following the increase in luminance could reflect slowly decreasing dendritic input and a more rapid axonal hyperpolarization. Next, we determined how the excitatory input AII amacrine cells receive from rod bipolar cells depended on mean luminance. Steady-state release at the rod bipolar cell → AII synapse was measured using voltage-clamp recordings from AII amacrine cells (in retinal slices). These recordings revealed a decrease in AII holding current with increasing luminance, consistent with a reduction in glutamate release from rod bipolar cells (Figure 5H). Furthermore, bath application of NBQX reduced the AII holding current more at low luminance levels than at higher levels (Figures 6A and 6B)—again consistent with a reduction in glutamate release at the higher luminance level.

ORP4 (OSBP2) is a closely related paralogue of OSBP, but its function is unknown. Here we show that ORP4 binds similar sterol and lipid ligands as OSBP and other ORPs but is uniquely required for the proliferation and survival of cultured cells. Recombinant ORP4L and a variant without a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (ORP4S) bind 25-hydroxycholesterol and extract and transfer cholesterol between liposomes. Two conserved histidine residues in the OSBP homology domain ORP4 are essential for binding phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate but not sterols. The PH domain of ORP4L also binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in the Golgi apparatus. However, in the context of ORP4L, the PH domain is required for normal organization of the vimentin network. Unlike OSBP, RNAi silencing of all ORP4 variants (including a partial PH domain truncation termed ORP4M) in HEK293 and HeLa cells resulted in growth arrest but not cell death. ORP4 silencing in non-transformed intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)-18 caused apoptosis characterized by caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase processing, DNA cleavage, and JNK phosphorylation. IEC-18 transformed with oncogenic H-Ras have increased expression of ORP4L and ORP4S proteins and are resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of ORP4 silencing. Results suggest that ORP4 promotes the survival of rapidly proliferating cells."

To explore the phylogenetic diversity and community structure of Sebacinales endophytes from agricultural and grassland habitats under different land uses, we analysed the roots of herbaceous plants using strain isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and co-cultivation experiments. A new sebacinoid strain named Serendipita herbamans belonging to Sebacinales group B was isolated from the roots of Bistorta vivipara, which is characterized by colourless monilioid cells (chlamydospores) that become yellow with age. This species was very common and widely distributed in association with a broad spectrum of herbaceous plant families in diverse habitats, independent of land use type. Ultrastructurally, the presence of S. herbamans was detected in the cortical cells of Plantago media, Potentilla anserina and Triticum aestivum. In addition, 13 few frequent molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) or species were found across agricultural and grassland habitats, which did not exhibit a distinctive phylogenetic structure. Laboratory-based assays indicate that S. herbamans has the ability to colonize fine roots and stimulate plant growth. Although endophytic Sebacinales are widely distributed across agricultural and grassland habitats, TEM and nested PCR analyses reinforce the observation that these microorganisms are present in low quantity in plant roots, with no evidence of host specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2033856456,"Background Diarrhea is an important cause of childhood mortality in developing countries like Pakistan because of unhygienic conditions, lack of awareness, and unwise use of preventive measures. Mechanical transmission of diarrheal pathogens by house flies, Musca domestica, is believed as the most effective route of diarrhea transmission. Although the use of insecticides as a preventive measure is common worldwide for the management of house flies, success of the measure could be compromised by the prevailing environmental temperature since it significantly affects toxicity of insecticides and thus their efficacy. Peaks of the house fly density and diarrheal cases are usually coincided and season specific, yet little is known about the season specific use of insecticides. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine the temperature-toxicity relationship in house flies, the effect of post-bioassays temperature (range, 20–34°C) on the toxicity of seven insecticides from organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, profenofos), pyrethroid (cypermethrin, deltamethrin) and new chemical (emamectin benzoate, fipronil, spinosad) classes was evaluated by using a feeding bioassay method. From 20–34°C, the toxicities of chlorpyrifos, profenofos, emamectin and fipronil increased 2.10, 2.93, 2.40 and 3.82 fold (i.e. positive temperature coefficient), respectively. Whereas, the toxicities of cypermethrin, deltamethrin and spinosad decreased 2.21, 2.42 and 3.16 fold (i.e. negative temperature coefficient), respectively. Conclusion/Significance These findings suggest that for the reduction in diarrheal cases, house flies should be controlled with insecticides according to the prevailing environmental temperature. Insecticides with a positive temperature coefficient may serve as potential candidates in controlling house flies and diarrhea epidemics in hot season and vice versa."
https://openalex.org/W1977801817,"Lipolysis in fat tissue represents a major source of circulating fatty acids. Previously, we have found that lipolysis in adipocytes is controlled by early growth response transcription factor Egr1 that directly inhibits transcription of adipose triglyceride lipase, ATGL (Chakrabarti, P., Kim, J. Y., Singh, M., Shin, Y. K., Kim, J., Kumbrink, J., Wu, Y., Lee, M. J., Kirsch, K. H., Fried, S. K., and Kandror, K. V. (2013) Mol. Cell. Biol. 33, 3659-3666). Here we demonstrate that knockdown of the lipid droplet protein FSP27 (a.k.a. CIDEC) in human adipocytes increases expression of ATGL at the level of transcription, whereas overexpression of FSP27 has the opposite effect. FSP27 suppresses the activity of the ATGL promoter in vitro, and the proximal Egr1 binding site is responsible for this effect. FSP27 co-immunoprecipitates with Egr1 and increases its association with and inhibition of the ATGL promoter. Knockdown of Egr1 attenuates the inhibitory effect of FSP27. These results provide a new model of transcriptional regulation of ATGL."
https://openalex.org/W2122568884,"Protein synthesis is crucial for both persistent synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. De novo protein expression can be restricted to specific neurons within a population, and to specific dendrites within a single neuron. Despite its ubiquity, the functional benefits of spatial protein regulation for learning are unknown. We used computational modeling to study this problem. We found that spatially patterned protein synthesis can enable selective consolidation of some memories but forgetting of others, even for simultaneous events that are represented by the same neural population. Key factors regulating selectivity include the functional clustering of synapses on dendrites, and the sparsity and overlap of neural activity patterns at the circuit level. Based on these findings, we proposed a two-step model for selective memory generalization during REM and slow-wave sleep. The pattern-matching framework we propose may be broadly applicable to spatial protein signaling throughout cortex and hippocampus."

Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities associated with the shells of the sea turtle eggs revealed approximately 16,664 operational taxonomic units, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the most dominant phyla. Subsequent isolation of Actinobacteria from the eggshells led to the identification of several genera (Streptomyces, Amycolaptosis, Micromomospora Plantactinospora and Solwaraspora) that inhibit hyphal growth of the pathogen F. falciforme. These bacterial genera constitute a first set of microbial indicators to evaluate the potential role of microbiota in conservation of endangered sea turtle species."
https://openalex.org/W1984702411,"The homeostatic lung protective effects of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) may require the transport of circulating proteinase inhibitor across an intact lung endothelial barrier. We hypothesized that uninjured pulmonary endothelial cells transport A1AT to lung epithelial cells. Purified human A1AT was rapidly taken up by confluent primary rat pulmonary endothelial cell monolayers, was secreted extracellularly, both apically and basolaterally, and was taken up by adjacent rat lung epithelial cells co-cultured on polarized transwells. Similarly, polarized primary human lung epithelial cells took up basolaterally-, but not apically-supplied A1AT, followed by apical secretion. Evidence of A1AT transcytosis across lung microcirculation was confirmed in vivo by two-photon intravital microscopy in mice. Time-lapse confocal microscopy indicated that A1AT co-localized with Golgi in the endothelium whilst inhibition of the classical secretory pathway with tunicamycin significantly increased intracellular retention of A1AT. However, inhibition of Golgi secretion promoted non-classical A1AT secretion, associated with microparticle release. Polymerized A1AT or A1AT supplied to endothelial cells exposed to soluble cigarette smoke extract had decreased transcytosis. These results suggest previously unappreciated pathways of A1AT bidirectional uptake and secretion from lung endothelial cells towards the alveolar epithelium and airspaces. A1AT trafficking may determine its functional bioavailablity in the lung, which could be impaired in individuals exposed to smoking or in those with A1AT deficiency."

Descriptive summary of data and logistic regression were used to identify possible predictors using odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and P-value of 0.05.Three hundred ninety four (46.5%) of all HIV positive women had intension to have more children. Three hundred seventy five (44.3%) were using contraceptive methods at time of survey. Injectable (70.7%) and male condom (47.6%) were most commonly used type of contraceptives. In the multivariable analysis, women who were urban dwellers (AOR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.27, 5.02), completed primary education (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.86) and those openly discussed about contraceptive methods with their husbands or sexual partners (AOR = 6.3; 95% CI: 3.42, 11.76) were more likely to use contraceptive. Women who have one or more living children were also more likely to use contraceptive compared with women with no child.Less than half of women used contraceptive methods. The use of condoms could impact unintended pregnancies and reduced risks of vertical and sexual transmission. Efforts to increase contraceptive utilization focusing on the barrier methods should be strengthen in HIV/AIDS chronic care units."

While it is well established that target-derived signals act on axons to regulate circuit assembly, the extent to which axon-derived signals control circuit formation is not known. In the Drosophila visual system, anterograde signals numerically match R1-R6 photoreceptors with their targets by controlling target proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Here we demonstrate that additional axon-derived signals selectively couple target survival with layer specificity. We show that Jelly belly (Jeb) produced by R1-R6 axons interacts with its receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk), on budding dendrites to control survival of L3 neurons, one of three postsynaptic targets. L3 axons then produce Netrin, which regulates the layer-specific targeting of another neuron within the same circuit. We propose that a cascade of axon-derived signals, regulating diverse cellular processes, provides a strategy for coordinating circuit assembly across different regions of the nervous system."

Membrane receptors and solute transporters are cotranslationally modified in rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by oligosaccharyltransferase, which transfers the N-glycan from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pp-dolichol to Asn at NX(S/T) (where X ≠ P) sites. N-Glycosylation is found in all domains of life (22Banerjee S. Vishwanath P. Cui J. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Robbins P.W. Samuelson J.

Protein synthesis and chaperone-assisted homeostasis consumes a large portion of cellular resources, and under stress conditions, reduced biosynthesis of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pp-dolichol activates the unfolded protein response, thus a metabolic mechanism of stress tolerance (24Shang J. Gao N. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Harding H.P. Lehrman M.A. Translation attenuation by PERK balances ER glycoprotein synthesis with lipid-linked oligosaccharide flux.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). With metazoan evolution, the ER N-glycan modification became a platform for remodeling in the Golgi and additional functionality at the cell surface. The N-glycans are trimmed and rebuilt beginning with the branching N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferases, encoded by the Mgat-1, Mgat-2, Mgat-4a/b/c, and Mgat-5 genes (25Dennis J.W. Lau K.S. Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Adaptive regulation at the cell surface by N-glycosylation.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). The branching enzymes form a linear pathway and require the donor substrate UDP-GlcNAc. The GlcNAc branches are extended with galactose, poly-N-acetyllactosamine, fucose, and sialic acid, generating sequences recognized by galectins, C-type lectins, and siglecs at the cell surface. Galectin binding to Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ, a common sequence of N-glycan branches of membrane proteins, forms multivalent complexes, which results in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous lattice at the cell surface. Strong selective pressures on Golgi remodeling and its substrates during vertebrate evolution (26Williams R. Ma X. Schott R.K. Mohammad N. Ho C.Y. Li C.F. Chang B.S. Demetriou M. Dennis J.W.

The Mgat4a−/− mice display suppressed secretion of insulin in response to glucose caused by a failure to retain Glut2 at the surface of β-cells (20Ohtsubo K. Takamatsu S. Minowa M.T. Yoshida A.

The Mgat4a-branched N-glycan on Glut2 binds to galectin-9, which slows mobility at the cell surface and loss to endocytosis, thus increasing the transport of glucose, and thereby insulin secretion. Although Mgat4a−/− mice display hypoinsulinemia and excess weight gain on a high fat diet, Mgat5−/− mice are resistant to weight gain and display hyperglucagonemia (29Cheung P. Pawling J. Partridge E.A. Sukhu B. Grynpas M. Dennis J.W. Metabolic homeostasis and tissue renewal are dependent on β1,6GlcNAc-branched N-glycans.Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 828-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting either a gain of function in glucagon secretion and/or a loss of function in hepatic Gcgr. Mice lacking Gcgr display resistance to obesity on a high fat diet with elevated circulating glucagon (30Gelling R.W. Du X.Q. Dichmann D.S. Romer J. Huang H. Cui L. Obici S. Tang B. Holst J.J.

Receptor deficiencies often result inelevated levels of the cognate ligand caused by feedback up-regulation of ligand production or secretion and/or failure to internalize and clear the ligand in the absence of receptor. Therefore, we hypothesized that the Gcgr may be regulated by Mgat5-dependent N-glycan branching in an HBP-dependent manner. The Gcgr is a member of the class B G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (32Mayo K.E. Miller L.J. Bataille D. Dalle S. Göke B. Thorens B. Drucker D.J. International Union of Pharmacology. XXXV. The glucagon receptor family.Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and activation results in the replacement of GDP with GTP bound to the Gsα subunit of the α/β/γ heterotrimeric complex. The GTP-bound Gsα activates adenylyl cyclase, and cAMP stimulates PKA, glycogen phosphorylase kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase leading to hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis (33Jiang G. Zhang B.B. Glucagon and regulation of glucose metabolism.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metabol. 2003; 284: E671-E678Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glucagon action attenuates hyperglycemia in experimental models and in subjects with type 2 diabetes (34Cho Y.M. Merchant C.E. Kieffer T.J. Targeting the glucagon receptor family for diabetes and obesity therapy.Pharmacol. Ther. 2012; 135: 247-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Here we report that Mgat5−/− mice and primary hepatocytes are hyposensitive to glucagon. The Mgat5-branched N-glycans on Gcgr increases receptor binding to galectin-9, which slows mobility and increases responsiveness to glucagon. GlcNAc supplementation increases UDP-GlcNAc flux to N-glycan branching in primary hepatocytes, and GlcNAc supplementation to Mgat5−/− mice restored the glycemic response to glucagon. Our findings reveal a role for HBP and N-glycan branching on Gcgr as a positive regulator of glucagon responsiveness. Age- and sex-matched littermates on the C57BL/6 background were used in all the experiments. The Mgat5−/− mutation was described previously (35Granovsky M. Fata J. Pawling J. Muller W.J. Khokha R. Dennis J.W. Suppression of tumor growth and metastasis in Mgat5-deficient mice.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and made isogenic on C57BL6 by 15 generations of backcrosses. The Mgat5−/− hypoglycemia phenotype has been validated on both 129/sv and C56BL6 backgrounds (29Cheung P. Pawling J. Partridge E.A. Sukhu B. Grynpas M. Dennis J.W.

Mice were maintained on a standard rodent chow (Teklad rodent diet, 18% protein, 6% fat, #2018) with a normal 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. In some experiments, mice were on low fat diet (Teklad rodent diet, 19% protein, 4% fat, #8604) or high fat diet (Teklad rodent diet, 19% protein, 9.8% fat, #2019) with or without GlcNAc (0.5 mg/ml) in the drinking water as indicated. Experiments were done according to protocols and guidelines approved by the Toronto Centre for Phenogenomics animal care committee. For intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTTs), mice were fasted for 16 h before intraperitoneal injection of 0.01 ml/g of body weight of a glucose solution containing 150 mg/ml. For oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a glucose solution was administered by oral gavage. Blood samples were drawn via the tail vain, and glucose was measured using a Glucometer Elite blood glucose meter (Bayer, Toronto, Canada). For the glucagon challenge (GC) test or insulin tolerance test (ITT), mice were fasted for 5 h and injected intraperitoneally with a glucagon solution of 1.6 μg/ml (0.01 ml/g body of weight) (16 μg/kg) or 0.75 units/kg of human insulin, respectively. Plasma glucagon and insulin were measured using a mouse endocrine LINCOplex kit (Linco Research) following the manufacturer's protocol. To measure the glycogen content in liver, 20–50 mg of tissue was acid-hydrolyzed in 2 m HCl at 95 °C for 2 h and neutralized using 2 m NaOH. The liberated glucose was assayed spectrophotometrically using the glucose reagent (hexokinase method) (Amresco, Solon, OH) following the manufacturer's protocol. Murine hepatocytes were isolated as previously described (36Flock G. Baggio L.L. Longuet C. Drucker D.J. Incretin receptors for glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are essential for the sustained metabolic actions of vildagliptin in mice.Diabetes. 2007; 56: 3006-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), seeded in 6-well plates at 4 × 105 cells/well in Williams E medium containing 5% FBS and 0.7 mm insulin for 3 h to allow attachment. The cells were washed with PBS and DMEM without glucose and phenol red. Cells were stimulated with 20 nm of glucagon, and medium was collected after 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, and 6 h and stored at −20 °C. To determine the residual glucose concentration in the cells, 2 n ice-cold HCl was added to cells, and lysates were incubated for 2 h at 95 °C followed by neutralization using 2 n NaOH. Glucose concentration in media and lysates were measured using the glucose reagent (hexokinase method) (Amresco, Solo, OH). Frozen liver tissue (80–100 mg) was crushed using the CellCrusherTM cryogenic tissue pulverizer under liquid nitrogen, and 1 ml of ice-cold solution of (40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, and 20% water) was added for metabolite extraction. For cells grown in cell culture plates, metabolites were extracted by adding 1 ml of ice-cold extraction solution (40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol, and 20% water) to the plate, scraping the cells and collecting in 1.5-ml vials (16Abdel Rahman A.M.

Samples were separated twice on a reversed phase HPLC column Inertsil ODS-3 of 4.6-mm internal diameter, 150-mm length, and 3 μm particle size (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) for MS analysis in positive and negative modes. The eluted metabolites were analyzed at the optimum polarity in MRM mode on electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (4000 QTRAP; ABSciex, Toronto, Canada) as previously described (16Abdel Rahman A.M.

Primary hepatocytes seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105cells/ml were cultured in Williams E medium without FBS for 16 h, then supplemented with 100 μmol/liter isomethyl butyl xanthine containing 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, or 1000 nm glucagon, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with ice-cold ethanol, and cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay kit or targeted mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole ABSciex 4000 QTRAP (LC-MS/MS). HEK293 Flp-In-TREx cells were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm Gln, penicillin/streptomycin, 3 μg/ml blastocidin, and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. Human Mgat5 cDNA was FLAG-tagged at the N terminus and cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO expression vector. The plasmid was integrated into the genome at a preintegrated FRT recombination site, by cotransfection with Flp recombinase encoding POG44 plasmid, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and OptiMEM medium lacking FBS or antibiotics. Following selection in 200 μg/ml of hygromycin, clones displayed 5–10-fold increase in Mgat5 enzyme activity when induced by 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 24 h. For Gcgr signaling in HEK293 Flp-In-TREx cells were transfected with 1 μg of Gcgr plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The next day cells were incubated with medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline and GlcNAc as indicated for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with glucagon as described, and cAMP was measured by targeted LC/MS-MS. Plasma membranes were prepared from primary hepatocytes using a cell surface isolation kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Plasma membrane preparation were analyzed via Western blot, and the ImageJ software was used to quantify signal intensity (37Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34981) Google Scholar). For liver membrane preparations, ∼2 g of liver tissue were homogenized in 15 ml of 0.32 m sucrose solution at 4 °C using a Teflon tissue grind tube SZ23 (Kontess Class Co., Vinland, NJ). Homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 600 × g. The supernatant was transferred to an ultra-clear ultracentrifuge tube (25 × 89 mm; Beckmann Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA) and underlayed with 15 ml of a 41% sucrose solution, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C. Membranes were collected at the interface and washed twice with 15 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). 125I-Labeled glucagon (50,000 cpm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was diluted in 100 μl of buffer. 40 μg of membrane preparation was dissolved in 200 μl buffer (25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 0.05% bacitracin, 2% BSA, 0.003% Tween 20). Tracer, membrane preparation, and 200 μl of glucagon solution at a final concentration from 10−12 to 10−6 m were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. To measure nonspecific binding, 1 mm nonlabeled glucagon was added to control samples. Binding reaction was stopped with 3 ml of buffer and immediately filtered through glass microfiber filters (Whatman GF/B). Filters were washed twice, and radioactivity was measured in a γ-scintillation counter. Experiments were carried out in duplicate with four independent liver membrane preparations. Insulin binding was measured with 125I-labeled insulin (50,000 cpm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 100 μl of buffer incubated with 40 μg of membrane preparation (200 μl). Mouse Gcgr (NCBI clone NM_008101.2) was subcloned via EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites into a pcDNA3 (−) vector (Invitrogen). An internal FLAG tag (DYKDDDK) followed by a linker sequence containing four glycine residues were inserted at the N terminus of the Gcgr after the putative cleavage signal site at amino acid 27 using a double-joint PCR strategy (38Yu C.E. Devlin B. Galloway N. Loomis E. Schellenberg G.D. ADLAPH: A molecular haplotyping method based on allele-discriminating long-range PCR.Genomics. 2004; 84: 600-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To generate a construct with an internal GFP tag or FLAG tag, the same double-joint PCR strategy was applied. GFP-Gcgr was subcloned into pEGFP-C1 vector with restriction enzymes AgeI and EcoRI. The glycosylation site mutants of Gcgr (i.e. N47Q, N60Q, N75Q, N79Q, and N118Q) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. Mouse galectin-9 coding sequence (NCBI clone NM_001159301.1) was subcloned via Xho and EcoRI into pERFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Endogenous Gcgr was detected with ST-18 antibody (39Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Wu C.R. Goldsmith P.K. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. Antibodies against specific extracellular epitopes of the glucagon receptor block glucagon binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For chemical cross-linking to detect cell surface galectin and Gcgr, hepatocytes transfected with RFP-galectin-9 overnight were treated with 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′-dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) for 15 min at room temperature. Complexes were pulled down with rabbit anti-RFP antibody and protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). For detection of FLAG-Gcgr, the anti-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used. For leucoagglutinin (L-PHA) binding, cells in 96-well plates were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h at 20 °C in 50 μl of PBS containing 1/5,000 of Hoechst 33342 and 2 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated L-PHA (Invitrogen). After washing with PBS, cell staining was quantified by IN Cell Analyzer 1000 automated fluorescence imaging. Primary hepatocytes were seeded on 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes and transfected with 1 μg of GFP-Gcgr and/or RFP-galectin-9 using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The next morning FRAP analyses was performed at room temperature on a confocal FV1000 Olympus microscope, with a 405-nm laser at full power in a circular region of interest with 50-pixel diameter. Cells were incubated with 30 mm lactose for 4 h prior to the FRAP experiment or overnight with 100 μm castanospermine or 20 mm GlcNAc supplementation in Williams E medium. Fluorescence during recovery was normalized to the pre-bleach intensity, and the data were averaged for a minimum of four to five animals in independent experiments in which 6–10 cells were bleached. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance using Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test and, where appropriate, by Student's t test using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. To characterize the metabolic phenotype in Mgat5+/+ and Mgat5−/− mice, blood glucose, glucagon, and insulin levels were measured in 6-month-old male mice. Significantly lower blood glucose was observed in Mgat5−/− mice, in both the fed state and after 5 h and 16 h of fasting, despite a 2-fold increase in serum glucagon levels and a 4-fold reduction in insulin levels i"
https://openalex.org/W1984765070,"Although modulation of protein levels is an important tool for study of protein function, it is difficult or impossible to knockdown or knockout genes that are critical for cell growth or viability. For such genes, a conditional knockdown approach would be valuable. The FKBP protein-based destabilization domain (DD)-tagging approach, which confers instability to the tagged protein in the absence of the compound Shield-1, has been shown to provide rapid control of protein levels determined by Shield-1 concentration. Although a strategy to knock-in DD-tagged protein at the endogenous loci has been employed in certain parasite studies, partly due to the relative ease of knock-in as a result of their mostly haploid lifecycles, this strategy has not been demonstrated in diploid or hyperploid mammalian cells due to the relative difficulty of achieving complete knock-in in all alleles. The recent advent of CRISPR/Cas9 homing endonuclease-mediated targeted genome cleavage has been shown to allow highly efficient homologous recombination at the targeted locus. We therefore assessed the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 to achieve complete knock-in to DD-tag the essential gene Treacher Collins-Franceschetti syndrome 1 (TCOF1) in human 293T cells. Using a double antibiotic selection strategy to select clones with at least two knock-in alleles, we obtained numerous complete knock-in clones within three weeks of initial transfection. DD-TCOF1 expression in the knock-in cells was Shield-1 concentration-dependent, and removal of Shield-1 resulted in destabilization of DD-TCOF1 over the course of hours. We further confirmed that the tagged TCOF1 retained the nucleolar localization of the wild-type untagged protein, and that destabilization of DD-TCOF1 resulted in impaired cell growth, as expected for a gene implicated in ribosome biogenesis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination to completely knock-in a DD tag likely represents a generalizable and efficient strategy to achieve rapid modulation of protein levels in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024351982,"Aberrant amyloid β (Aβ) production plays a causal role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. A major cellular pathway for Aβ generation is the activity-dependent endocytosis and proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, the molecules controlling activity-dependent APP trafficking in neurons are less defined. Mints are adaptor proteins that directly interact with the endocytic sorting motif of APP and are functionally important in regulating APP endocytosis and Aβ production. We analyzed neuronal cultures from control and Mint knockout neurons that were treated with either glutamate or tetrodotoxin to stimulate an increase or decrease in neuronal activity, respectively. We found that neuronal activation by glutamate increased APP endocytosis, followed by elevated APP insertion into the cell surface, stabilizing APP at the plasma membrane. Conversely, suppression of neuronal activity by tetrodotoxin decreased APP endocytosis and insertion. Interestingly, we found that activity-dependent APP trafficking and Aβ generation were blocked in Mint knockout neurons. We showed that wild-type Mint1 can rescue APP internalization and insertion in Mint knockout neurons. In addition, we found that Mint overexpression increased excitatory synaptic activity and that APP was internalized predominantly to endosomes associated with APP processing. We demonstrated that presenilin 1 (PS1) endocytosis requires interaction with the PDZ domains of Mint1 and that this interaction facilitates activity-dependent colocalization of APP and PS1. These findings demonstrate that Mints are necessary for activity-induced APP and PS1 trafficking and provide insight into the cellular fate of APP in endocytic pathways essential for Aβ production."
https://openalex.org/W2093181689,"Adiponectin is a well described anti-inflammatory adipokine that is highly abundant in serum. Previous reports have found that adiponectin deficiency promotes cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction in murine models, whereas its overexpression is protective. Two candidate adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, are uncharacterized with regard to cardiovascular tissue homeostasis, and their in vivo metabolic functions remain controversial. Here we subjected AdipoR1- and AdipoR2-deficient mice to chronic hind limb ischemic surgery. Blood flow recovery in AdipoR1-deficient mice was similar to wild-type; however, revascularization in AdipoR2-deficient mice was severely attenuated. Treatment with adiponectin enhanced the recovery of wild-type mice but failed to rescue the impairment observed in AdipoR2-deficient mice. In view of this divergent receptor function in the hind limb ischemia model, AdipoR1- and AdipoR2-deficient mice were also evaluated in a model of diet-induced obesity. Strikingly, AdipoR1-deficient mice developed severe metabolic dysfunction compared with wild type, whereas AdipoR2-deficient mice were protected from diet-induced weight gain and metabolic perturbations. These data show that AdipoR2, but not AdipoR1, is functionally important in an in vivo model of ischemia-induced revascularization and that its expression is essential for the revascularization actions of adiponectin. These data also show that, in contrast to revascularization responses, AdipoR1, but not AdipoR2 deficiency, leads to diet-induced metabolic dysfunction, revealing that these receptors have highly divergent roles in vascular and metabolic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1990903661,"Chronic low grade inflammation is closely linked to obesity-associated insulin resistance. To examine how administration of the anti-inflammatory compound indomethacin, a general cyclooxygenase inhibitor, affected obesity development and insulin sensitivity, we fed obesity-prone male C57BL/6J mice a high fat/high sucrose (HF/HS) diet or a regular diet supplemented or not with indomethacin (±INDO) for 7 weeks. Development of obesity, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance was monitored, and the effect of indomethacin on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was measured in vivo and in vitro using MIN6 β-cells. We found that supplementation with indomethacin prevented HF/HS-induced obesity and diet-induced changes in systemic insulin sensitivity. Thus, HF/HS+INDO-fed mice remained insulin-sensitive. However, mice fed HF/HS+INDO exhibited pronounced glucose intolerance. Hepatic glucose output was significantly increased. Indomethacin had no effect on adipose tissue mass, glucose tolerance, or GSIS when included in a regular diet. Indomethacin administration to obese mice did not reduce adipose tissue mass, and the compensatory increase in GSIS observed in obese mice was not affected by treatment with indomethacin. We demonstrate that indomethacin did not inhibit GSIS per se, but activation of GPR40 in the presence of indomethacin inhibited glucose-dependent insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. We conclude that constitutive high hepatic glucose output combined with impaired GSIS in response to activation of GPR40-dependent signaling in the HF/HS+INDO-fed mice contributed to the impaired glucose clearance during a glucose challenge and that the resulting lower levels of plasma insulin prevented the obesogenic action of the HF/HS diet.

https://openalex.org/W2020661893,"The Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) catalyzing conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA comprises three components: E1p, E2p, and E3. The E2p is the five-domain core component, consisting of three tandem lipoyl domains (LDs), a peripheral subunit binding domain (PSBD), and a catalytic domain (E2pCD). Herein are reported the following. 1) The x-ray structure of E2pCD revealed both intra- and intertrimer interactions, similar to those reported for other E2pCDs. 2) Reconstitution of recombinant LD and E2pCD with E1p and E3p into PDHc could maintain at least 6.4% activity (NADH production), confirming the functional competence of the E2pCD and active center coupling among E1p, LD, E2pCD, and E3 even in the absence of PSBD and of a covalent link between domains within E2p. 3) Direct acetyl transfer between LD and coenzyme A catalyzed by E2pCD was observed with a rate constant of 199 s(-1), comparable with the rate of NADH production in the PDHc reaction. Hence, neither reductive acetylation of E2p nor acetyl transfer within E2p is rate-limiting. 4) An unprecedented finding is that although no interaction could be detected between E1p and E2pCD by itself, a domain-induced interaction was identified on E1p active centers upon assembly with E2p and C-terminally truncated E2p proteins by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The inclusion of each additional domain of E2p strengthened the interaction with E1p, and the interaction was strongest with intact E2p. E2p domain-induced changes at the E1p active site were also manifested by the appearance of a circular dichroism band characteristic of the canonical 4'-aminopyrimidine tautomer of bound thiamin diphosphate (AP)."
https://openalex.org/W2082433000,"Since 2003, H5N1-subtype avian influenza viruses (AIVs) with both a deletion of 20 amino acids in the stalk of the neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein (A−) and a deletion of five amino acids at positions 80 to 84 in the non-structural protein NS1 (S−) have become predominant. To understand the influence of these double deletions in the NA and NS1 proteins on the pathogenicity of H5N1-subtype AIVs, we selected A/mallard/Huadong/S/2005 as a parental strain to generate rescued wild-type A−S− and three variants (A−S+ with a five-amino-acid insertion in the NS1 protein, A+S− with a 20-amino-acid insertion in the NA stalk, and A+S+ with insertions in both NA and NS1 proteins) and evaluated their biological characteristics and virulence. The titers of the AIVs with A− and/or S− replicated in DEF cells were higher than that of A+S+, and the A−S− virus exhibited a replication predominance when co-infected with the other variants in DEF cells. In addition, A−S− induced a more significant increase in the expression of immune-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of mallard ducks in vitro compared with the other variants. Furthermore, an insertion in the NA and/or NS1 proteins of AIVs resulted in a notable decrease in virulence in ducks, as determined by intravenous pathogenicity index, and the two insertions exerted a synergistic effect on the attenuation of pathogenicity in ducks. In addition, compared with A+S+ and A+S−, the A−S+ and A−S− viruses that were introduced via the intranasal inoculation route exhibited a faster replication ability in the lungs of ducks. These data indicate that both the deletions in the NA stalk and the NS1 protein contribute to the high pathogenicity of H5N1 AIVs in ducks."
https://openalex.org/W2036601115,"CblC is involved in an early step in cytoplasmic cobalamin processing following entry of the cofactor into the cytoplasm. CblC converts the cobalamin cargo arriving from the lysosome to a common cob(II)alamin intermediate, which can be subsequently converted to the biologically active forms. Human CblC exhibits glutathione (GSH)-dependent alkyltransferase activity and flavin-dependent reductive decyanation activity with cyanocobalamin (CNCbl). In this study, we discovered two new GSH-dependent activities associated with the Caenorhabditis elegans CblC for generating cob(II)alamin: decyanation of CNCbl and reduction of aquocobalamin (OH2Cbl). We subsequently found that human CblC also catalyzes GSH-dependent decyanation of CNCbl and reduction of OH2Cbl, albeit efficiently only under anaerobic conditions. The air sensitivity of the human enzyme suggests interception by oxygen during the single-electron transfer step from GSH to CNCbl. These newly discovered GSH-dependent single-electron transfer reactions expand the repertoire of catalytic activities supported by CblC, a versatile B12-processing enzyme."

Aim To determine risk factors associated with disclosing HIV status among antiretroviral therapy (ART) recipients in South Africa. Setting A cross-sectional study on risk factors for viremia and drug resistance took place at two outpatient HIV clinics in 2008, at a large hospital located in Soweto, South Africa. Methods We conducted a secondary data analysis on socio-economic characteristics and HIV status disclosure to anyone, focusing on gender differences. Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to model the associations between risk factors and HIV status disclosure. Additionally, descriptive analysis was conducted to describe gender differences of HIV status disclosure to partner, parents, parents in law, partner, child, family, employer, and other. Patients A total of 883 patients were interviewed. The majority were women (73%) with median age of 39 years. Results Employed patients were less likely to disclose than unemployed (odds ratio (OR) 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1–1.0; p = 0.05)). Women with higher income were more likely to disclose (OR 3.25; 95% CI 0.90–11.7; p = 0.07) than women with lower income, while men with higher income were less likely (OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.02–1.99; p = 0.17) than men with lower income. Men were more likely than women to disclose to their partner (p<0.01), and to partner and family (p<0.01), women were more likely than men to disclose to child and family (p<0.01), to child, family and others (p = 0.01). Conclusion Being employed imposed a risk factor for HIV status disclosure, additionally we found an interaction effect of gender and income on disclosure. Interventions designed to reduce workplace discrimination and gender-sensitive interventions promoting disclosure are strongly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W1977525422,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a potent proinflammatory lipid mediator, is synthesized rapidly in response to extracellular stimuli by the activation of acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase (lyso-PAFAT). We have reported previously that lyso-PAFAT activity is enhanced in three distinct ways in mouse macrophages: rapid activation (30 s) after PAF stimulation and minutes to hours after LPS stimulation. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPCAT2) was later identified as a Ca(2+)-dependent lyso-PAFAT. However, the mechanism of rapid lyso-PAFAT activation within 30 s has not been elucidated. Here we show a new signaling pathway for rapid biosynthesis of PAF that is mediated by phosphorylation of LPCAT2 at Ser-34. Stimulation by either PAF or ATP resulted in PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of LPCAT2 to enhance lyso-PAFAT activity and rapid PAF production. Biochemical analyses showed that the phosphorylation of Ser-34 resulted in augmentation of Vmax with minimal Km change. Our results offer an answer for the previously unknown mechanism of rapid PAF production."
https://openalex.org/W2012011968,"Neonatal high-oxygen exposure leads to elevated blood pressure, microvascular rarefaction, vascular dysfunction and arterial (aorta) rigidity in adult rats. Whether structural changes are present in the matrix of aorta wall is unknown. Considering that elastin synthesis peaks in late fetal life in humans, and early postnatal life in rodents, we postulated that transient neonatal high-oxygen exposure can trigger premature vascular remodelling. Sprague Dawley rat pups were exposed from days 3 to 10 after birth to 80% oxygen (vs. room air control) and were studied at 4 weeks. Blood pressure and vasomotor response of the aorta to angiotensin II and to the acetylcholine analogue carbachol were not different between groups. Vascular superoxide anion production was similar between groups. There was no difference between groups in aortic cross sectional area, smooth muscle cell number or media/lumen ratio. In oxygen-exposed rats, aorta elastin/collagen content ratio was significantly decreased, the expression of elastinolytic cathepsin S was increased whereas collagenolytic cathepsin K was decreased. By immunofluorescence we observed an increase in MMP-2 and TIMP-1 staining in aortas of oxygen-exposed rats whereas TIMP-2 staining was reduced, indicating a shift in the balance towards degradation of the extra-cellular matrix and increased deposition of collagen. There was no significant difference in MMP-2 activity between groups as determined by gelatin zymography. Overall, these findings indicate that transient neonatal high oxygen exposure leads to vascular wall alterations (decreased elastin/collagen ratio and a shift in the balance towards increased deposition of collagen) which are associated with increased rigidity. Importantly, these changes are present prior to the elevation of blood pressure and vascular dysfunction in this model, and may therefore be contributory."
https://openalex.org/W2001068228,"Inter-individual diet variation within populations is likely to have important ecological and evolutionary implications. The diet-fitness relationships at the individual level and the emerging population processes are, however, poorly understood for most avian predators inhabiting complex terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we use an isotopic approach to assess the trophic ecology of nestlings in a long-lived raptor, the Bonelli’s eagle Aquila fasciata, and investigate whether nestling dietary breath and main prey consumption can affect the species’ reproductive performance at two spatial scales: territories within populations and populations over a large geographic area. At the territory level, those breeding pairs whose nestlings consumed similar diets to the overall population (i.e. moderate consumption of preferred prey, but complemented by alternative prey categories) or those disproportionally consuming preferred prey were more likely to fledge two chicks. An increase in the diet diversity, however, related negatively with productivity. The age and replacements of breeding pair members had also an influence on productivity, with more fledglings associated to adult pairs with few replacements, as expected in long-lived species. At the population level, mean productivity was higher in those population-years with lower dietary breadth and higher diet similarity among territories, which was related to an overall higher consumption of preferred prey. Thus, we revealed a correspondence in diet-fitness relationships at two spatial scales: territories and populations. We suggest that stable isotope analyses may be a powerful tool to monitor the diet of terrestrial avian predators on large spatio-temporal scales, which could serve to detect potential changes in the availability of those prey on which predators depend for breeding. We encourage ecologists and evolutionary and conservation biologists concerned with the multi-scale fitness consequences of inter-individual variation in resource use to employ similar stable isotope-based approaches, which can be successfully applied to complex ecosystems such as the Mediterranean."
https://openalex.org/W2085456168,"Signaling through the interleukin (IL)-22 cytokine axis provides essential immune protection in the setting of extracellular infection as part of type 17 immunity. Molecular regulation of IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) protein levels is unknown. In murine lung epithelia, IL-22R is a relatively short-lived protein (t½ ∼1.5 h) degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome under normal unstimulated conditions, but its degradation is accelerated by IL-22 treatment. Lys(449) within the intracellular C-terminal domain of the IL-22R serves as a ubiquitin acceptor site as disruption of this site by deletion or site-directed mutagenesis creates an IL-22R variant that, when expressed in cells, is degradation-resistant and not ubiquitinated. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β phosphorylates the IL-22R within a consensus phosphorylation signature at Ser(410) and Ser(414), and IL-22 treatment of cells triggers GSK-3β inactivation. GSK-3β overexpression results in accumulation of IL-22R protein, whereas GSK-3β depletion in cells reduces levels of the receptor. Mutagenesis of IL-22R at Ser(410) and Ser(414) results in receptor variants that display reduced phosphorylation levels and are more labile as compared with wild-type IL-22R when expressed in cells. Further, the cytoskeletal protein cortactin, which is important for epithelial spreading and barrier formation, is phosphorylated and activated at the epithelial cell leading edge after treatment with IL-22, but this effect is reduced after GSK-3β knockdown. These findings reveal the ability of GSK-3β to modulate IL-22R protein stability that might have significant implications for cytoprotective functions and therapeutic targeting of the IL-22 signaling axis."

Recently, an antimicrobial peptide inhibitor, RJPXD33, was identified with dual affinity for LpxA and LpxD. To gain a fundamental understanding of the molecular basis of inhibitor binding, we determined the crystal structure of LpxA from Escherichia coli in complex with RJPXD33 at 1.9 Å resolutions. Our results suggest that the peptide binds in a unique modality that mimics (R)-β-hydroxyacyl pantetheine binding to LpxA and displays how the peptide binds exclusive of the native substrate, acyl-acyl carrier protein. Acyltransferase binding studies with photo-labile RJPXD33 probes and truncations of RJPXD33 validated the structure and provided fundamental insights for future design of small molecule inhibitors. Overlay of the LpxA-RJPXD33 structure with E. coli LpxD identified a complementary peptide binding pocket within LpxD and serves as a model for further biochemical characterization of RJPXD33 binding to LpxD."

Recently, substitution of histidine 50 in αSyn with a glutamine, H50Q, was identified as a new familial PD mutant. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies revealed that the H50Q substitution causes an increase of the flexibility of the C-terminal region. This finding provides direct evidence that this PD-causing mutant can mediate long range effects on the sampling of αSyn conformations. In vitro aggregation assays showed that substitution of His-50 with Gln, Asp, or Ala promotes αSyn aggregation, whereas substitution with the positively charged Arg suppresses αSyn aggregation. Histidine carries a partial positive charge at neutral pH, and so our result suggests that positively charged His-50 plays a role in protecting αSyn from aggregation under physiological conditions."

The association of cathelicidin with lung function decrement and respiratory infection is undefined. We determined the independent relationship of cathelicidin with lung function.In a cross-sectional analysis of 650 participants in an urban observational cohort with high smoking prevalence, plasma 25(OH)-vitamin D and cathelicidin levels were measured from stored samples obtained within 6 months of spirometry study visits. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine the independent association between low cathelicidin (defined as the lowest quartile of the cohort) and absolute forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).The mean age of the cohort was 49 years; 91% were black, 35% female and 41% HIV-infected. Participants with low cathelicidin had a 183 mL lower FEV1 compared to higher cathelicidin (p = 0.009); this relationship was maintained (115 ml lower; p = 0.035) after adjusting for demographics, BMI, and smoking. Neither HIV serostatus, heavy smoking history, nor 25(OH)-vitamin D levels were associated with cathelicidin levels. Participants with low cathelicidin had a greater prevalence of prior bacterial pneumonia (21% versus 14%; p = 0.047). Inclusion of pneumonia in adjusted models did not substantially reduce the FEV1 decrement observed with low cathelicidin (104 mL lower FEV1; p = 0.05). Lung function decrements associated with low cathelicidin were greatest among individuals with lower 25(OH)-vitamin D levels.In a cohort at risk for airflow obstruction, low cathelicidin was independently associated with lower FEV1. These clinical data support a mechanistic link between 25(OH)-vitamin D deficiency and lung function impairment, independent of pneumonia risk."

The former has been identified in all three kingdoms of life and often pairs with tRNAGly that carries an A73 discriminator base, while the latter is found only in bacteria and chloroplasts and is almost always coupled with tRNAGly that contains U73. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single GlyRS gene, GRS1, provides both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions, and tRNAGly isoacceptors in both compartments possess A73. We showed herein that Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana cytoplasmic GlyRSs (both α2-type enzymes) can rescue both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial defects of a yeast grs1- strain, while Escherichia coli GlyRS (a α2β2-type enzyme) and A. thaliana organellar GlyRS (a (αβ)2-type enzyme) failed to rescue either defect of the yeast mull allele. However, a head-to-tail αβ fusion of E. coli GlyRS effectively supported the mitochondrial function.

https://openalex.org/W1971438560,"Islet transplantation is a promising potential therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes. The outcome of islet transplantation depends on the transplantation of a sufficient amount of β-cell mass. However, the initial loss of islets after transplantation is problematic. We hypothesized the hyperglycemic status of the recipient may negatively affect graft survival. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the effect of insulin treatment on islet transplantation involving a suboptimal amount of islets in Akita mice, which is a diabetes model mouse with an Insulin 2 gene missense mutation. Fifty islets were transplanted under the left kidney capsule of the recipient mouse with or without insulin treatment. For insulin treatment, sustained-release insulin implants were implanted subcutaneously into recipient mice 2 weeks before transplantation and maintained for 4 weeks. Islet transplantation without insulin treatment did not reverse hyperglycemia. In contrast, the group that received transplants in combination with insulin treatment exhibited improved fasting blood glucose levels until 18 weeks after transplantation, even after insulin treatment was discontinued. The group that underwent islet transplantation in combination with insulin treatment had better glucose tolerance than the group that did not undergo insulin treatment. Insulin treatment improved graft survival from the acute phase (i.e., 1 day after transplantation) to the chronic phase (i.e., 18 weeks after transplantation). Islet apoptosis increased with increasing glucose concentration in the medium or blood in both the in vitro culture and in vivo transplantation experiments. Expression profile analysis of grafts indicated that genes related to immune response, chemotaxis, and inflammatory response were specifically upregulated when islets were transplanted into mice with hyperglycemia compared to those with normoglycemia. Thus, the results demonstrate that insulin treatment protects islets from the initial rapid loss that is usually observed after transplantation and positively affects the outcome of islet transplantation in Akita mice."
https://openalex.org/W2070949203,"Background Clinical trial results registries may contain relevant unpublished information. Our main aim was to investigate the potential impact of the inclusion of reports from industry results registries on systematic reviews (SRs). Methods We identified a sample of 150 eligible SRs in PubMed via backward selection. Eligible SRs investigated randomized controlled trials of drugs and included at least 2 bibliographic databases (original search date: 11/2009). We checked whether results registries of manufacturers and/or industry associations had also been searched. If not, we searched these registries for additional trials not considered in the SRs, as well as for additional data on trials already considered. We reanalysed the primary outcome and harm outcomes reported in the SRs and determined whether results had changed. A “change” was defined as either a new relevant result or a change in the statistical significance of an existing result. We performed a search update in 8/2013 and identified a sample of 20 eligible SRs to determine whether mandatory results registration from 9/2008 onwards in the public trial and results registry ClinicalTrials.gov had led to its inclusion as a standard information source in SRs, and whether the inclusion rate of industry results registries had changed. Results 133 of the 150 SRs (89%) in the original analysis did not search industry results registries. For 23 (17%) of these SRs we found 25 additional trials and additional data on 31 trials already included in the SRs. This additional information was found for more than twice as many SRs of drugs approved from 2000 as approved beforehand. The inclusion of the additional trials and data yielded changes in existing results or the addition of new results for 6 of the 23 SRs. Of the 20 SRs retrieved in the search update, 8 considered ClinicalTrials.gov or a meta-registry linking to ClinicalTrials.gov, and 1 considered an industry results registry. Conclusion The inclusion of industry and public results registries as an information source in SRs is still insufficient and may result in publication and outcome reporting bias. In addition to an essential search in ClinicalTrials.gov, authors of SRs should consider searching industry results registries."

Current postexposure treatments are inadequate at later stages of infection, when high levels of anthrax toxins are present. Anthrax toxins enter cells via two identified anthrax toxin receptors: tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). We hypothesized that host cells would be protected from anthrax toxins if anthrax toxin receptor expression was effectively silenced using RNA interference (RNAi) technology. Thus, anthrax toxin receptors in mouse and human macrophages were silenced using targeted siRNAs or blocked with specific antibody prior to challenge with anthrax lethal toxin. Viability assays were used to assess protection in macrophages treated with specific siRNA or antibody as compared with untreated cells. Silencing CMG2 using targeted siRNAs provided almost complete protection against anthrax lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity and death in murine and human macrophages. The same results were obtained by prebinding cells with specific antibody prior to treatment with anthrax lethal toxin. In addition, TEM8-targeted siRNAs also offered significant protection against lethal toxin in human macrophage-like cells. Furthermore, silencing CMG2, TEM8, or both receptors in combination was also protective against MEK2 cleavage by lethal toxin or adenylyl cyclase activity by edema toxin in human kidney cells. Thus, anthrax toxin receptor-targeted RNAi has the potential to be developed as a life-saving, postexposure therapy against anthrax."
https://openalex.org/W2082420097,"Homogentisate solanesyltransferase (HST) plays an important role in plastoquinone (PQ) biosynthesis and acts as the electron acceptor in the carotenoids and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis pathways. We isolated and identified a T-DNA insertion mutant of the HST gene that displayed the albino and dwarf phenotypes. PCR analyses and functional complementation also confirmed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by disruption of the HST gene. The mutants also had some developmental defects, including trichome development and stomata closure defects. Chloroplast development was also arrested and chlorophyll (Chl) was almost absent. Developmental defects in the chloroplasts were consistent with the SDS-PAGE result and the RNAi transgenic phenotype. Exogenous gibberellin (GA) could partially rescue the dwarf phenotype and the root development defects and exogenous ABA could rescue the stomata closure defects. Further analysis showed that ABA and GA levels were both very low in the pds2-1 mutants, which suggested that biosynthesis inhibition by GAs and ABA contributed to the pds2-1 mutants' phenotypes. An early flowering phenotype was found in pds2-1 mutants, which showed that disruption of the HST gene promoted flowering by partially regulating plant hormones. RNA-sequencing showed that disruption of the HST gene resulted in expression changes to many of the genes involved in flowering time regulation and in the biosynthesis of PQ, Chl, GAs, ABA and carotenoids. These results suggest that HST is essential for chloroplast development, hormone biosynthesis, pigment accumulation and plant development."

Because manipulation of the lipid composition in cells is difficult, we investigated the influence of different lipids on purified KvAP channels reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers of known composition. Lipids developed two distinct and independent effects on the KvAP channels; lipids interacting with the pore lowered the energy barriers for the final transitions, whereas voltage sensor-bound lipids shifted the midpoint of activation dependent on their electrostatic charge. Above all, the midpoint of activation was determined only by those lipids the channels came in contact with first after purification and can seemingly only be exchanged if the channel resides in the open state. The high affinity of the bound lipids to the binding site has implications not only on our understanding of the gating mechanism but also on the general experimental design of any lipid dependence study."

The SNP rs6854854 in ANXA5 was statistically significant after conservative Bonferroni correction when 464 melanoma patients and 400 controls were analyzed in a discovery Phase I. However, this finding could not be replicated in the validation phase, perhaps because the minor allele frequency of SNP rs6854854 varies depending on the geographical region considered. Additionally, a second SNP (rs6431588) located on ILKAP was found to be associated with melanoma after considering a combined set of 1,883 MM cases and 1,358 disease-free controls. The OR was 1.29 (95% CI 1.12–1.48; p-value = 4×10−4). Both SNPs, rs6854854 in ANXA5 and rs6431588 in ILKAP, show population structure, which, assuming that the Spanish population is not significantly structured, suggests a role of these loci on a specific genetic adaptation to different environmental conditions. Furthermore, the biological relevance of these genes in MM is supported by in vitro experiments, which show a decrease in the transcription levels of ANXA5 and ILKAP in melanoma cells compared to normal melanocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1989014919,"Given that BMI correlates with risk of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and that hypertension is a common comorbid condition, we hypothesize that hypertension augments significantly the impact of obesity on T2DM onset.We obtained data on T2DM in Kuwaiti natives from Kuwait Health Network Registry. We considered 1339 comorbid individuals with onset of hypertension preceding that of T2DM, and 3496 non-hypertensive individuals but with T2DM. Multiple linear regressions, ANOVA tests, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to quantify the impact of hypertension on correlation of BMI with age at onset and risk of T2DM.Impact of increasing levels of BMI on age at onset ot T2DM is seen augmented in patients diagnosed with hypertension. We find that the slope of the inverse linear relationship between BMI and onset age of T2DM is much steep in hypertensive patients (-0.69, males and -0.39, females) than in non-hypertensive patients (-0.36, males and -0.17, females). The decline in onset age for an unit increase of BMI is two-fold in males than in females. Upon considering BMI as a categorical variable, we find that while the mean onset age of T2DM in hypertensive patients decreases by as much as 5-12 years in every higher BMI categories, significant decrease in non-hypertensive patients exists only when severely obese. Hazard due to hypertension (against the baseline of non-hypertension and normal weight) increases at least two-fold in every obese category. While males have higher hazard due to hypertension in early adulthood, females have higher hazard in late adulthood.Pre-existing condition of hypertension augments the association of BMI with Type 2 diabetes onset in both males and females. The presented results provide health professionals directives on the extent of weight-loss required to delay onset of Type 2 diabetes in hypertensive versus non-hypertensive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2046846055,"Due to their small size, lung tumors in rodents are typically investigated using high-field magnetic resonance (MR) systems (4.7 T or higher) to achieve higher signal-to-noise ratios, although low-field MR systems are less sensitive to susceptibility artifacts caused by air in the lung. We investigated the feasibility of detecting lung tumors in living, freely breathing mice with a 1-T compact permanent magnet MR system. In total, 4 mice were used, and MR images of mouse lungs were acquired using a T1-weighted three-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequence without cardiac or respiratory gating. The delineation and size of lung tumors were assessed and compared with histopathological findings. Submillimeter lesions were demonstrated as hyperintense, relative to the surrounding lung parenchyma, and were delineated clearly. Among the 13 lesions validated in histopathological sections, 11 were detected in MR images; the MR detection rate was thus 84.6%. A strong correlation was obtained in size measurements between MR images and histological sections. Thus, a dedicated low-field MR system can be used to detect lung tumors in living mice noninvasively without gating."
https://openalex.org/W2067681578,"The fundamental role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in inflammation underlines their importance as therapeutic targets for various inflammatory medical conditions, including infectious, vascular, neurobiological and autoimmune disease. Although decades of research have yielded several p38 inhibitors, most clinical trials have failed, due to lack of selectivity and efficacy in vivo. This underlines the continuous need to screen for novel structures and chemotypes of p38 inhibitors. Here we report an optimized MK2-EGFP translocation assay in a semi-automated image based High Content Analysis (HCA) system to screen a combinatorial library of 3362 proprietary compounds with extensive variations of chemotypes. By determining the levels of redistribution of MK2-EGFP upon activation of the Rac/p38 pathway in combination with compound treatment, new candidates were identified, which modulate p38 activity in living cells. Based on integrated analysis of TNFα release from human whole blood, biochemical kinase activity assays and JNK3 selectivity testing, we show that this cell based assay reveals a high overlap and predictability for cellular efficacy, selectivity and potency of tested compounds. As a result we disclose a new comprehensive short-list of subtype inhibitors which are functional in the low nanomolar range and might provide the basis for further lead-optimization. In accordance to previous reports, we demonstrate that the MK2-EGFP translocation assay is a suitable primary screening approach for p38-MAPK drug development and provide an attractive labor- and cost saving alternative to other cell based methods including determination of cytokine release from hPBMCs or whole blood."
https://openalex.org/W1995477411,"Unraveling the mechanisms of hematopoiesis regulated by multiple cytokines remains a challenge in hematology. IL-3 is an allergic cytokine with the multilineage potential, while CSF-1 is produced in the steady state with restricted lineage coverage. Here, we uncovered an instructive role of CSF-1 in IL-3-mediated hematopoiesis. CSF-1 significantly promoted IL-3-driven CD11c+ cell expansion and dampened basophil and mast cell generation from C57BL/6 bone marrow. Further studies indicated that the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis contributed significantly to IL-3-induced CD11c+ cell generation through enhancing c-Fos-associated monopoiesis. CD11c+ cells induced by IL-3 or IL-3/CSF-1 were competent in cellular maturation and endocytosis. Both IL-3 and IL-3/CSF-1 cells lacked classical dendritic cell appearance and resembled macrophages in morphology. Both populations produced a high level of IL-10, in addition to IL-1, IL-6 and TNFα, in response to LPS, and were relatively poor T cell stimulators. Collectively, these findings reveal a role for CSF-1 in mediating the IL-3 hematopoietic pathway through monopoiesis, which regulates expansion of CD11c+ macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2044226675,"Four systems of cyclic somatic embryogenesis of Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus Maxim) were used to study the mechanism of embryonic cell cluster generation. The first, direct somatic embryo induction (DSEI), generates secondary embryos directly from the primary somatic embryos; the second, direct embryogenic cell cluster induction (DEC)), induces embryogenic cell clusters directly from somatic embryos in agar medium. Subsequently, we found that when DEC-derived somatic embryos are transferred to suspension culture or a bioreactor culture, only somatic embryos are induced, and embryogenic cell clusters cannot form. Therefore, these new lines were named DEC cultured by liquid medium (ECS) and DEC cultured by bioreactor (ECB), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy showed that DEC epidermal cells contained a variety of inclusions, distinct from other lines. A cDNA library of DEC was constructed, and 1,948 gene clusters were obtained and used as probes. RNA was prepared from somatic embryos from each of the four lines and hybridized to a microarray. In DEC, 7 genes were specifically upregulated compared with the other three lines, and 4 genes were downregulated. EsXTH1 and EsPLT1, which were among the genes upregulated in DEC, were cloned using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Real-time quantitative PCR showed EsXTH1 was more highly expressed in DEC than in other lines throughout the culture cycle, and EsPLT1 expression in DEC increased as culture duration increased, but remained at a low expression level in other lines. These results suggest that EsXTH1 and EsPLT1 may be the essential genes that play important roles during the induction of embryogenic cell clusters."
