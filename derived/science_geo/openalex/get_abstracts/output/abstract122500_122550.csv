https://openalex.org/W2104543679,"A detailed kinetic analysis of three extranuclear end points of apoptosis, phosphatidylserine exposure, α-fodrin degradation, and plasma membrane blebbing, was performed and compared with nuclear fragmentation and the activation of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)-like proteases in Jurkat T lymphocytes stimulated by anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (anti-Fas mAb) and in monocytic U937 cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and cycloheximide. Phosphatidylserine exposure was quantitated by plasma clotting time, as well as annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding, and the ICE-like protease activity was examined by the cleavage of a specific fluorogenic peptide substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin. VAD-chloromethylketone (VAD-cmk), an inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, effectively inhibited ICE-like activity in both cell types studied, whereas the calpain inhibitor calpeptin was ineffective. VAD-cmk also effectively inhibited all three extranuclear events, as well as nuclear fragmentation, in Jurkat cells stimulated by anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, indicating that ICE-like proteases play an important role in the regulation of this apoptotic system. Calpain inhibitors were ineffective in this system. TNF-induced extranuclear and nuclear changes in U937 cells were inhibited by calpeptin but were not as effectively inhibited by VAD-cmk as in Jurkat cells. This suggests that ICE-like enzymes predominate in anti-Fas monoclonal antibody-stimulated Jurkat cells, whereas proteases affected by calpain inhibitors as well as the ICE-like enzymes are involved in the signaling of apoptotic events in TNF-induced U937 cells. Importantly, the two apoptotic systems seem to be regulated by different proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2069526456,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an abundant intracellular enzyme that is thought to act as a negative regulator of certain signaling pathways. The C terminus of PTP1B contains two proline-rich regions which conform to the canonical class II Src homology 3 domain binding motif, Pro-X-X-Pro-X-Arg. In this study, we establish that PTP1B interacts with Crk, Grb2, and p130Cas in vitro and with at least one of these, p130Cas, in intact cells. The interaction of PTP1B and p130Cas is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation but can be disrupted by replacing two critical proline residues in the proline-rich domain of PTP1B between amino acids 301 and 315. When wild-type PTP1B is expressed in 3Y1-v-crk cells, p130Cas shows substantial dephosphorylation, whereas the PTP1B proline mutant does not have this effect. In 3Y1 and 3Y1 v-crk-transformed fibroblasts, almost all of the total PTP1B and about 40% of total p130Cas co-sediment with membranes composed primarily of endoplasmic reticulum. These results suggest that the proline-rich domain between amino acids 301 and 315 in PTP1B binds Src homology 3-containing proteins and that p130Cas may be a physiological target of this phosphatase in cells."

During the identification of protein kinase C (PKC)-interacting proteins by a yeast two-hybrid assay, a novel protein containing three LIM domains, designated ENH, was shown to associate with PKC in an isoform-specific manner. Deletion analysis demonstrated that any single LIM domain of ENH associates with the NH2-terminal region of PKC. ENH associated with PKC in COS-7 cells and was phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Upon treatment of the cells with phorbol ester, ENH in the membrane fraction was translocated to the cytosol fraction in vivo. Other LIM domain-containing proteins, such as Enigma and LIM-kinase 1, also interacted with PKC through their LIM domains. These results suggest that the LIM domain is one of the targets of PKC and that the LIM-PKC interaction may shed light on undefined roles of LIM domain-containing proteins.

These responses have been previously shown to be dependent on Gq and Ras. Rho, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases, regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement and transcriptional activation of the c-fos serum response element. Immunofluorescence staining of cardiomyocytes shows that Rho is present and predominantly cytosolic. We used two inhibitors of Rho function, dominant negative N19RhoA and Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase, to examine the possible requirement for Rho in α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated hypertrophy. Both inhibitors markedly attenuated atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) reporter gene expression induced by α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation with phenylephrine, and virtually abolished the increase in ANF reporter gene expression induced by GTPase-deficient Gαq. These effects were reproduced with the myosin light chain-2 reporter gene. Notably, N19RhoA did not block the ability of activated Ras to induce ANF and myosin light chain-2 reporter gene expression. Furthermore, activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase by phenylephrine was not blocked by N19RhoA, nor was it stimulated by an activated mutant of RhoA. Since activated RhoA and Ras produce a large synergistic effect on ANF-luciferase gene expression, we conclude that Rho functions in a pathway separate from but complementary to Ras. Our results provide direct evidence that Rho is an effector of Gαq signaling and suggest for the first time that a low molecular weight GTPase other than Ras is involved in regulating myocardial cell growth and gene expression in response to heterotrimeric G protein-linked receptor activation.

Several lines of evidence indicate that α1-adrenergic receptor-induced hypertrophy is mediated by both Gq- and Ras-dependent pathways (8Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.-Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E.

Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Res. 1996; 78: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but MAP kinase/ERK is not required for the morphological changes induced by PE (11Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and ERK activation is not sufficient to induce hypertrophic responses (14Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of constitutively activated Gαq alone is not sufficient to induce the typical changes in cell size and cellular organization seen with α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation or Ras (9LaMorte V.J. Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the activation of both Ras and Gq signaling pathways may be required to induce the genetic and morphological responses associated with hypertrophy.Recently, the Rho family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (Cdc42, Rac, Rho) has been shown to participate in the regulation of various kinase (16Coso O.A.

These proteins are well accepted as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, stress fibers, and focal adhesions. In addition to these cytoskeletal effects, Rho has recently been demonstrated to regulate activation of the serum response element (SRE) in the c-fos promoter (22Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Given the prominent effects of Rho on both gene expression and morphology in other systems, we hypothesized that this low molecular weight GTPase might also have a functional role in myocardial cell regulation.In this study we examined the involvement of Rho in the α1-adrenergic receptor-activated hypertrophic responses. We show that Rho is required for PE-induced ANF and MLC-2 gene expression. Furthermore, while the induction of ANF and MLC-2 gene expression by activated Gαq is demonstrated to be dependent on Rho function, the response to oncogenic Ras is not. Our data suggest that the α1-adrenergic receptor and heterotrimeric Gq protein transduce signals through Rho, and that Rho functions in a pathway separate from but complementary to Ras in mediating genetic responses in myocardial hypertrophy.DISCUSSIONEvidence implicating Rho in G protein-coupled receptor-induced gene expression was recently presented in a study published by Treisman's laboratory. These authors demonstrated that in NIH 3T3 cells a constitutively activated Rho mutant induced transcriptional activation of the c-fos SRE; in addition lysophosphatidic acid- and AlF4−-induced signaling to c-fos SRE activation was inhibited by C3 transferase (22Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Our work in cardiomyocytes further implicates Rho in mediating the effects of G protein-coupled receptor agonists on transcriptional activation and, more specifically, identifies the cardiac-specific ANF and MLC-2 genes as targets for Rho-dependent activation.Our finding that inhibition of Rho function blocks PE-induced activation of the ANF- and MLC-2-luciferase reporter genes implicates Rho in mediating genetic responses to α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation. The fact that the inhibition was incomplete could reflect insufficient levels of expression of N19RhoA, or alternatively, PE signaling through an additional pathway that is independent of Rho function. The latter alternative is consistent with data from previous studies, which suggested the existence of two distinct pathways mediating PE-induced gene expression (9LaMorte V.J. Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these pathways is mediated by Gαq, and the other by Ras. Interestingly, the effect of coexpressing N19RhoA with activated Gαq or oncogenic Ras differentiated these pathways. Whereas N19RhoA blocked Gαq-induced ANF- and MLC-2-luciferase gene expression, it had no apparent inhibitory effect on Ras-induced gene expression. In addition, PE-induced activation of kinase cascades downstream of Ras (ERK and JNK) was unaffected by N19RhoA. Our data therefore suggest that Rho is required in Gαq-mediated signaling, but not in Ras-mediated events. Further support for the existence of two distinct pathways come from our demonstration that there is a synergistic effect of oncogenic L61Ras and either activated Gαq or L63RhoA on ANF-luciferase gene expression.The level at which the separate Ras and Rho signaling pathways converge to give a synergistic increase in ANF-luciferase expression is not yet clear. Microinjection studies in fibroblasts suggest an ordered set of interactions between Ras and the Rho family GTPases, namely that Ras is upstream of and required for activation of Rac, which in turn activates Rho (21Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar, 34Chant J. Stowers L. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Coordination of Ras- and Rho-mediated signaling pathways could occur through the interaction between p120RasGAP and p190RhoGAP proteins (35Settleman J. Albright C.F. Foster L.C. Weinberg R.A.

Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15954-15957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (40Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that Rho is activated by PE and Gαq independent of Ras. In addition, Rho does not interact with the Ras signaling pathway via activation of MAP kinases.Where in the signaling pathway Rho functions is under current investigation. One mechanism by which Rho might affect Gq-dependent hypertrophic responses is by regulating the cellular level of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This possibility is suggested by the finding that in fibroblasts Rho regulates the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (43Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), an enzyme that is critical for the production of PIP2, the substrate for Gq-activated phospholipase C. If RhoA regulates the production of PIP2 in cardiac myocytes, the amount of substrate available for phospholipase C hydrolysis and consequent protein kinase C activation and Ca2+ mobilization initiated by Gq-linked α1-adrenergic receptor activation might be regulated by this pathway. Alterations in PIP2 levels may also affect the activity of other phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes, such as phospholipase D, which has been shown to be regulated by Rho (44Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In addition, Rho has been postulated to be regulated by and/or to modulate tyrosine kinase activities (46Kumagai N. Morii N. Fujisawa K. Nemoto Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24535-24538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Targets of Rho-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation include the p125 focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), which is itself a tyrosine kinase, and paxillin (48Rankin S. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 49Seckl M.J. Morii N. Narumiya S. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6984-6990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several serine-threonine protein kinases have also recently been cloned and characterized as Rho effectors (50Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 51Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A.

Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), and the study of their activation and possible kinase cascades that they influence will further aid our understanding of the role of Rho in regulating the hypertrophic response.It is well established that, in selected systems, Rho function is required to effect changes in cellular morphology induced by G protein-coupled receptors. Jalink et al. (53Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ADP-ribosylation of Rho inhibits neurite retraction and neuronal cell rounding induced by lysophosphatidic acid and thrombin. In addition, Tigyi et al. (54Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Yang C. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) recently reported that lysophosphatidic acid-induced neurite retraction in PC12 cells is regulated by phosphoinositide-Ca2+ signaling and is blocked by ADP-ribosylation of Rho. These effects are pertussis toxin-insensitive, suggesting the involvement of a Gq pathway. Rho-dependent cytoskeletal responses might also be activated through Gq-coupled receptors in cardiac myocytes and serve as triggers for subsequent events involved in the establishment of a hypertrophic phenotype. For example, activation of tyrosine kinases associated with the actin cytoskeleton (e.g. p125FAK) may serve to signal from G protein-coupled receptors to downstream kinase cascades, as observed in integrin signaling pathways (55Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar).Another pertussis toxin-insensitive protein, G12, has been previously demonstrated to possess transforming activity (56Aaronson S.A.

We recently presented evidence that G12 can couple to low molecular weight GTPases and participates in thrombin-stimulated growth responses (30Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

In addition, activated Gα12 and/or the related Gα13 stimulate stress fiber formation, focal adhesion assembly and Na+-H+ exchange through Rho-dependent mechanisms (61Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 62Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

Thus, G12 is another possible transducer of information from the α1-adrenergic receptor to the small G protein Rho.In this study we provide the first direct evidence that Rho is required for Gq-mediated signaling. Our findings demonstrate a specific role for Rho in regulating α1-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of ANF and MLC-2 gene expression, and show that in cardiac myocytes, Rho function is required for Gαq but not for Ras-induced responses. These results suggest that growth regulation through Gq-coupled receptors involves activation of Rho-dependent as well as Ras-dependent processes. INTRODUCTIONStimulation of the α1-adrenergic receptor in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes induces a hypertrophic response accompanied by activation of a subset of immediate early genes (e.g. c-fos, c-jun, and egr-1), up-regulation of a constitutively expressed contractile protein gene (myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2)), 1The abbreviations used are: MLC-2myosin light chain-2ANFatrial natriuretic factorMAPmitogen-activated proteinPEphenylephrineSREserum response elementERKextracellular signalregulated kinaseJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseHAhemagglutininGAPGTPase-activating proteinPIP2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. and reactivation of embryonic genes (e.g. atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), β-myosin heavy chain, and skeletal α-actin).

Several lines of evidence indicate that α1-adrenergic receptor-induced hypertrophy is mediated by both Gq- and Ras-dependent pathways (8Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.-Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E.

Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and ERK activation is not sufficient to induce hypertrophic responses (14Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of constitutively activated Gαq alone is not sufficient to induce the typical changes in cell size and cellular organization seen with α1-adrenergic receptor stimulation or Ras (9LaMorte V.J. Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the activation of both Ras and Gq signaling pathways may be required to induce the genetic and morphological responses associated with hypertrophy.Recently, the Rho family of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins (Cdc42, Rac, Rho) has been shown to participate in the regulation of various kinase (16Coso O.A.

These proteins are well accepted as regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are involved in the formation of filopodia, lamellipodia, stress fibers, and focal adhesions. In addition to these cytoskeletal effects, Rho has recently been demonstrated to regulate activation of the serum response element (SRE) in the c-fos promoter (22Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Given the prominent effects of Rho on both gene expression and morphology in other systems, we hypothesized that this low molecular weight GTPase might also have a functional role in myocardial cell regulation.In this study we examined the involvement of Rho in the α1-adrenergic receptor-activated hypertrophic responses. We show that Rho is required for PE-induced ANF and MLC-2 gene expression. Furthermore, while the induction of ANF and MLC-2 gene expression by activated Gαq is demonstrated to be dependent on Rho function, the response to oncogenic Ras is not. Our data suggest that the α1-adrenergic receptor and heterotrimeric Gq protein transduce signals through Rho, and that Rho functions in a pathway separate from but complementary to Ras in mediating genetic responses in myocardial hypertrophy."

One well characterized substrate of these proteases is the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We report here that α-fodrin, an abundant membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein, is cleaved rapidly and specifically during Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis; this cleavage is mediated by an ICE/Ced-3 protease distinct from the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase protease. Studies in cells treated with these apoptotic stimuli reveal that both fodrin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis are inhibited by acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp chloromethyl ketone and CrmA, specific inhibitors of ICE/Ced-3 proteases. However, fodrin proteolysis can be distinguished from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis by its relative insensitivity to acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aldehyde (DEVD-CHO), a selective inhibitor of a subset of ICE/Ced-3 proteases that includes CPP32. DEVD-CHO protects cells from Fas-induced apoptosis but does not prevent fodrin proteolysis, indicating that cleavage of this protein can be uncoupled from apoptotic cell death. Moreover, purified fodrin is cleaved in vitro by CPP32 (but not by ICE) into fragments of the same size observed in vivo during apoptosis. These findings suggest that fodrin proteolysis in vivo may reflect the activity of multiple ICE/Ced-3 proteases whose partial sensitivity to DEVD-CHO reflects a limited contribution from CPP32, or an ICE/Ced-3 protease less sensitive than CPP32 to DEVD-CHO inhibition.

INTRODUCTIONThe human phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a heme-containing enzyme complex critical for defense against microorganisms (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Defective functioning of this oxidase results in the susceptibility to infection that characterizes patients with chronic granulomatous disease. The genetic defects affecting the oxidase are currently the focus of corrective gene therapy trials (2Thrasher A.J. de Alwis M. Casimir C.M. Kinnon C. Page K. Lebkowski J. Segal A.W. Levinsky R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 761-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Li F. Linton G.F. Sekhsaria S. Whiting-Theobald N. Katkin J.P. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase assembles from two membrane (gp91phox and p22phox which together comprise flavocytochrome b558) and three cytosolic (p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox) components in response to a signaling pathway mediated through the small GTP-binding protein Rac (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The heme cofactor is required for enzymatic function: the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the vacuolar membrane to molecular oxygen. The superoxide generated by this process in turn gives rise to toxic byproducts which are used in cellular defense against ingested bacteria and fungi (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Despite efforts by several laboratories, the sites within the oxidase where the essential heme cofactors are bound have not been defined (4Quinn M.T. Mullen J.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Segal A.W. Immunodeficiency. 1993; 4: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). Heme copurifies with the cytochrome b subunits, gp91phox and p22phox (6Segal A.W. Immunodeficiency. 1993; 4: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). However, inherited mutations in either of these subunits are associated with the absence of detectable heme in the enzyme complex and destabilization of the proteins, thus frustrating efforts to identify the specific heme-liganding residues (7Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We undertook to address this problem via study of the FRE1 reductase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FRE1 is homologous to gp91phox (8Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and encodes a plasma membrane-associated subunit of an iron reductase (9Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FRE1 or FRE2 is required for iron uptake in yeast (10Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). FRE1 is required for the major (90%) extracellular ferric reductase activity under most conditions and appears to be a structural subunit of the externally directed reductase activity (8Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Chelated ferric iron outside the cell is reduced by this activity to ferrous iron and then transported into the cell by the high-affinity iron uptake system (11Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Thus, this iron reductase of yeast, like the NADPH oxidase of humans, is involved in the transfer of electrons from a cytosolic donor across a membrane to an extracellular acceptor.The yeast iron reductase, like the human NADPH oxidase, requires heme for its function. The requirement of heme for the plasma membrane ferric reductase of yeast is supported by the lack of activity in mutants deficient in heme biosynthesis (12Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, FRE1 expression levels correlate with the visible spectrum attributed to the b heme cofactor (13Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The appearance of this visible spectrum is extremely similar to the spectrum of the purified NADPH oxidase b cytochrome (13Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two hemes are probably present in each complex of the NADPH oxidase, as indicated by quantitation of heme in the purified cytochrome (4Quinn M.T. Mullen J.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Midpoint potential titration of the gp91phox Arg54→ Ser mutant is also consistent with the presence of two hemes with potentials of −220 and −300 mV (5Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and subsequent reanalysis of the data for the normal protein indicates the presence of two low potential hemes of −225 and −265 mV (5Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Data from resonance Raman spectroscopy suggests a bis-imidazole coordination (15Hurst J.K. Loehr T.M. Curnutte J.T. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1627-1634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The low potential hemes distinguish this enzyme from most other heme enzymes. In this regard, it is significant that redox titration of the heme spectrum of the yeast FRE1 reductase also reveals an extremely low midpoint potential of about −250 mV (13Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The spectral and functional similarities of the yeast FRE1 reductase and the human NADPH oxidase suggested to us that study of the heme ligands in FRE1 might shed light on heme coordination in the human enzyme.RESULTSOur initial objective was to identify the heme-liganding residues within the FRE1 predicted protein. FRE1, like gp91phox, contains multiple hydrophobic domains consistent with transmembrane domains occurring within the amino-terminal two-thirds of the protein. A pair of histidine residues separated by 13 intervening amino acids (His294 and His308) appears within one of these hydrophobic domains. This is followed by an intervening hydrophobic domain and another hydrophobic domain containing a pair of histidines, again separated by 13 amino acids (His364 and His378). The analogous residues in gp91phox can be recognized by their spacing and context (Fig. 1, A and B). A pair of histidine residues separated by 13 amino acids (His101 and His115) appears buried in a hydrophobic region, followed by an intervening hydrophobic domain and another hydrophobic domain containing two histidines separated by 12 amino acids (His209 and His222) (Fig. 1, A and B). A similar motif consisting of two pairs of spaced histidine residues has been linked to heme coordination in organelle b cytochromes of mitochondria (CYTb of the bc1 complex) and chloroplasts (cytb6 of the b6f complex) (21Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrman R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Cramer W.A. Knaff D.B. Energy Transduction in Biological Membranes: A Textbook of Bioenergetics. Springer-Verlag, New York1990: 330-335Google Scholar, 24Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A).The contribution of these four conserved histidine residues to the heme binding of FRE1 was therefore examined experimentally. To eliminate background reductase activity, the endogenous FRE1 and FRE2 genes were deleted from the haploid genome of a test strain of yeast (YPH499). Surface reductase activity conferred by transformation of this strain with a high copy-number plasmid carrying FRE1 could then be attributed entirely to expression from the plasmid. Site-directed mutagenesis of the FRE1 plasmid, individually altering histidine residues at amino acid positions 294, 308, 364, or 378 to alanine, reduced the ferric reductase activity of the transformants to levels indistinguishable from the vector control (Fig. 2A). The effect of these mutations upon heme binding was determined by evaluating the reduced-minus-oxidized absorption spectrum of the plasma membranes. Transformants with the mutated FRE1 plasmids almost completely lacked the plasma membrane heme spectrum (Fig. 2B), and the heme content which was calculated from the amplitude of the γ band at 428 nm was negligible (Fig. 2A). The very small amount of residual heme may be attributed to plasma membrane heme proteins other than FRE1 or FRE2 or to very low levels of mitochondrial cross-contamination. As a control, we chose to mutate another histidine in the FRE1 primary sequence. Instead of a random histidine, we selected a residue in a conserved region. This mutated histidine residue (FRE1 amino acid 462) occurs in the conserved HPFT motif (His-Pro-Phe-Tyr) which is situated in the hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal region and is thought to play a role in FAD-isoalloxazine binding (14Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The reductase activity of the H462A transformant was 27% compared with the wild-type allele; however, the heme spectrum, although reduced in amplitude, was not fundamentally altered (Fig. 2).Fig. 2FRE1 mutant alleles deficient in reductase activity and heme.

Strain 499Δ1Δ2 was transformed with plasmids: lane 1, carrying the wild-type FRE1 allele; lane 2, lacking FRE1; lanes 3-6, containing FRE1 with the critical histidine mutations H294A, H308A, H364A, H378A; or lane 7, containing FRE1 with the HPFT histidine mutation H462A. The transformants were induced and ferric reductase activities were measured (12Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar) (open bars).

Representative experiments of three determinations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We considered that the failure to insert heme into FRE1 might destabilize the protein, making it difficult to distinguish mutations affecting heme liganding from mutations affecting protein stability. Therefore, we evaluated FRE1 protein expression in the histidine mutants. The mutations did not significantly affect the level of FRE1 protein as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3), making it likely that abrogation of the heme spectrum was a specific consequence of the point mutation and not the result of protein destabilization.Fig. 3FRE1 protein levels expressed by the wild-type and mutant FRE1 alleles. Strain 499Δ1Δ2 was transformed with plasmids lacking FRE1, carrying the wild-type FRE1 allele, the critical histidine mutations H294A, H308A, H364A, H378A, or HPFT histidine mutant H462A. The transformants were induced for ferric reductase activity. Cell lysates (alkali lysis) were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, and probed with a FRE1 anti-peptide antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence.

Most likely there are two hemes per protein monomer. Each heme is coordinated between a pair of histidine residues located within distinct α-helical transmembrane domains separated by an intervening transmembrane domain. The 12-13 amino acids of primary sequence separating heme-liganding histidines corresponds to the separation between the two hemes. These regions appear α-helical in character, and, thus, the imidazoles separated by 12-13 amino acids are likely to face the same side of the helix. The hemes coordinated by these histidines are likely to be situated one above the other within the membrane and perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (Fig. 4). This orientation of the hemes near opposite sides of the lipid bilayer would be expected to facilitate the transmembrane electron transport that is critical for the function of these proteins. This model resembles the model described for heme coordination in a class of organelle b cytochromes (21Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrman R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The plasma membrane is portrayed as two layers of circles with tails to indicate the phospholipid bilayer. Cylinders represent three consecutive transmembrane α helices.

The hemes, shown as squares, contain a hexacoordinate iron (black dots). A similar model has been proposed for the mitochondrial and chloroplast b cytochromes (21Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrman R.G.

This result is difficult to reconcile with the bis-heme model described above. It is possible that disruption of the imidazole ligand of one of the hemes interferes with insertion of the second heme, due to cooperativity in the heme loading process. Alternatively, effects on protein folding or membrane insertion resulting from the failure to properly insert one of the hemes might result in loss of the second heme.The similarity between the yeast FRE1 reductase and the human NADPH oxidase helps to elucidate features of both enzymes. The residues of FRE1 required for heme binding are conserved with gp91phox, suggesting that the corresponding residues coordinate heme in the NADPH oxidase. However, the corresponding mutations in gp91phox have been uninformative. Three of the four residues corresponding to the heme-liganding residues of FRE1 have been mutated in gp91phox as experiments of nature, i.e. as naturally occurring mutations in chronic granulomatous disease patients (His101→ Arg, His209→ Tyr, His222→ Arg) (7Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells taken from each of these patients, neither the heme spectrum attributable to flavocytochrome b558 nor the mutant gp91phox protein was detected (7Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, structure-function relationships in the NADPH oxidase could not be deduced from these naturally occurring mutations.Although the FRE1 reductase functions primarily to reduce iron and the NADPH oxidase functions to reduce oxygen, the FRE1 reductase has recently been shown to be capable of inefficient oxygen reduction (9Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Introduction of components of the NADPH oxidase into yeast therefore might provide a setting for studying the requirements for efficient superoxide generation. The requirements for heme insertion into the active membrane complex could also be studied in yeast. Defining and satisfying these requirements will be important for efforts to reconstitute the NADPH oxidase in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.The shared bis-heme binding motif raises the question of the evolutionary and functional relationships between the cell surface membrane proteins gp91phox and FRE1 and the organelle b cytochromes. At the level of primary amino acid sequence, little more than the spacing of the histidines in a generally hydrophobic context is conserved between these two groups of proteins. However, a more closely related protein family can be defined, including FRE1 and gp91phox. The members of this family possess hydropathy profiles with multiple (six to eight) hydrophobic domains at the amino terminus. The bis-heme binding motif occurs in this region. A hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal domain characterizes these proteins and is absent from the organelle b cytochromes. Within this hydrophilic tail are a number of conserved amino acid motifs that may relate to cofactor binding (NADPH and FAD) (19Roman D.G. Dancis A. Anderson G.J. Klausner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and that appear in the same order and with similar spacing. This protein family includes the homologs of the gp91phox gene from various other species including pigs, mice, and even plants (26Groom Q.J. Torres M.A. Fordham-Skelton A.P. Hammond-Kosack K.E. Robinson N.J. Jones J.D.G. Plant J. 1996; 10: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and these genes presumably function as part of a superoxide generating complex in cellular defense. A computer search of the recently completed Saccharomyces Genome Data Base for homologs of FRE1 identified FRE2 and seven additional open reading frames that appear to belong to the same gene family (Table I). These newly identified yeast genes resemble FRE1 to varying degrees but show little similarity to the organelle b cytochromes. The role of the bis-heme binding motif will be further clarified by definition of the cellular localization and function of the members of this gene family. It is highly likely that transmembrane electron transport will be involved in the function of these genes.Table ISaccharomyces cerevisiae FRE1 familyGene (identifier)FASTA score (versus FRE1)Motifs (number of initial amino acid)Bis-hemeHP(F/Y)(T/S)GP(F/Y)GCG(P/S)FRE1 YLR214w4593294462514652FRE2 YKL220c565316479526677YNR060w574309472519685YLL051c572323493538678YOR381w566316479526677YOR384w566310473520660YOL152w351197369411YGL160w254136306543YLR047c149152320CYTb PIR A001594382 Open table in a new tab INTRODUCTIONThe human phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a heme-containing enzyme complex critical for defense against microorganisms (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Defective functioning of this oxidase results in the susceptibility to infection that characterizes patients with chronic granulomatous disease. The genetic defects affecting the oxidase are currently the focus of corrective gene therapy trials (2Thrasher A.J. de Alwis M. Casimir C.M. Kinnon C. Page K. Lebkowski J. Segal A.W. Levinsky R.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 761-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Li F. Linton G.F. Sekhsaria S. Whiting-Theobald N. Katkin J.P. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Blood. 1994; 84: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NADPH oxidase assembles from two membrane (gp91phox and p22phox which together comprise flavocytochrome b558) and three cytosolic (p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox) components in response to a signaling pathway mediated through the small GTP-binding protein Rac (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The heme cofactor is required for enzymatic function: the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the vacuolar membrane to molecular oxygen. The superoxide generated by this process in turn gives rise to toxic byproducts which are used in cellular defense against ingested bacteria and fungi (1Thrasher A.J. Keep N.H. Wientjes F. Segal A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Despite efforts by several laboratories, the sites within the oxidase where the essential heme cofactors are bound have not been defined (4Quinn M.T. Mullen J.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol.

Heme copurifies with the cytochrome b subunits, gp91phox and p22phox (6Segal A.W. Immunodeficiency. 1993; 4: 167-179PubMed Google Scholar). However, inherited mutations in either of these subunits are associated with the absence of detectable heme in the enzyme complex and destabilization of the proteins, thus frustrating efforts to identify the specific heme-liganding residues (7Roos D. de Boer M. Kuribayashi F. Meischl C. Weening R.S. Segal A.W. Ahlin A. Nemet K. Hossle J.P. Bernatowska-Matuszkiewicz E. Middleton-Price H. Blood. 1996; 87: 1663-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We undertook to address this problem via study of the FRE1 reductase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FRE1 is homologous to gp91phox (8Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and encodes a plasma membrane-associated subunit of an iron reductase (9Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FRE1 or FRE2 is required for iron uptake in yeast (10Georgatsou E. Alexandraki D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). FRE1 is required for the major (90%) extracellular ferric reductase activity under most conditions and appears to be a structural subunit of the externally directed reductase activity (8Dancis A. Roman D.G. Anderson G.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Chelated ferric iron outside the cell is reduced by this activity to ferrous iron and then transported into the cell by the high-affinity iron uptake system (11Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Thus, this iron reductase of yeast, like the NADPH oxidase of humans, is involved in the transfer of electrons from a cytosolic donor across a membrane to an extracellular acceptor.The yeast iron reductase, like the human NADPH oxidase, requires heme for its function. The requirement of heme for the plasma membrane ferric reductase of yeast is supported by the lack of activity in mutants deficient in heme biosynthesis (12Lesuisse E. Labbe P. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1989; 135: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, FRE1 expression levels correlate with the visible spectrum attributed to the b heme cofactor (13Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The appearance of this visible spectrum is extremely similar to the spectrum of the purified NADPH oxidase b cytochrome (13Shatwell K.P. Dancis A. Cross A.R. Klausner R.D. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14240-14244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two hemes are probably present in each complex of the NADPH oxidase, as indicated by quantitation of heme in the purified cytochrome (4Quinn M.T. Mullen J.L. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7303-7309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Segal A.W. West I. Wientjes F. Nugent J.H.A. Chavan A.J. Haley B. Garcia R.C. Rosen H. Scrace G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Midpoint potential titration of the gp91phox Arg54→ Ser mutant is also consistent with the presence of two hemes with potentials of −220 and −300 mV (5Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and subsequent reanalysis of the data for the normal protein indicates the presence of two low potential hemes of −225 and −265 mV (5Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).

INTRODUCTIONThe components of machinery for protein secretion in Escherichia coli are encoded by the sec genes. The SecY protein is a central component of the membrane-embedded part of the secretion machinery, and functions in close interaction with other integral membrane proteins, SecE and SecG (1Nishiyama K.-i.

Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the SecY-SecE interaction is important not only for the functioning but also for the stable existence of the SecY protein (3Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T.

Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When an uncomplexed form of SecY is produced due to unbalanced expression of the secY and secE genes, it is rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation (6Taura T. Baba T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A mutated form of SecY, SecY24, in which SecY-SecE interaction has been mutationally impaired, is also degraded at 42°C (3Baba T.

In mutants with compromised FtsH functions, both overproduced SecY protein and the SecY24 mutant protein are stabilized (7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). FtsH contains two transmembrane segments N-terminally located and a large cytoplasmic domain (8Tomoyasu T. Yamanaka K. Murata K.

The cytoplasmic domain of FtsH includes a region that is homologous to the AAA ATPase family members involved in a variety of cellular processes (10Tomoyasu T. Yuki T. Morimura S. Mori H. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain contains a region homologous with a zinc protease sequence motif (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The transmembrane region is required for the oligomeric structure of FtsH (9Akiyama Y.

The hflB mutation, known to increase lysogenization frequency of bacteriophage λ by stabilizing the cII protein, proved to be an allele of the ftsH gene (12Herman C. Ogura T. Tomoyasu T. Hiraga S.

Recently, an ATP-dependent protease activity of FtsH was described (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T.

Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 13Herman C. Thévenet D.

It was shown that FtsH homologs (Yta10, Yta12, and Osd1/Yme1) in the yeast mitochondria also participate in degradation of some inner membrane proteins (14Pajic A. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W.

However, their proteolytic activities have not been characterized in vitro using purified proteins.In this work, we characterized FtsH with respect to its activities to hydrolyze ATP and to degrade the SecY protein. The results indicate that FtsH has an ATP-dependent protease activity with high substrate specificity.DISCUSSIONFtsH is required in vivo for rapid elimination of the uncomplexed forms of SecY (7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization described in this study established that FtsH directly degrades SecY. FtsH-dependent degradation of SecY was demonstrated using purified SecY protein as well as using detergent extracts of membranes. The proteolysis was ATP-dependent and not observed with the ATPase-deficient mutants of FtsH. It was demonstrated previously (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) that σ32, the heat shock σ factor, was degraded by FtsH in vitro. Although SecY and σ32 are apparently remote in nature, they are substrates of a common FtsH protease.The results of our mutational analyses indicate that the ATP binding motif A1 in the region homologous to the AAA family members is essential for the ATPase and proteolytic activities of FtsH. The synthetic loss of FtsH functions observed for the ftsH81 and ftsH84 mutations may point to a role of the A2 motif in conjunction with the A1 motif. The inability of the A1 mutants to degrade SecY indicates that the ATPase activity is essential for the proteolytic activity of FtsH. From analogy to other ATP-dependent proteases, such as E. coli ClpP proteases, ATP hydrolysis may be coupled with unfolding of substrate proteins and their presentation to the proteolytic active site in FtsH.Our results show that the zinc binding motif in FtsH is also important for the SecY proteolysis activity, and the mutant protein, with an alteration in the glutamine residue, that is implicated to be crucial in the catalysis of zinc metalloproteases (34Hooper N.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) has markedly decreased proteolytic activity. A requirement for zinc was described for σ32 degradation (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the reaction mechanism of the FtsH protease requires further mutational and structural studies of the FtsH region around this motif as well as clarification of the primary targets of the initial hydrolysis within the SecY and σ32 amino acid sequences.In addition to σ32, the λcII protein can be degraded by purified FtsH-His6-Myc in vitro. 3A. Kihara, Y. Akiyama, and K. Ito, unpublished results. The fact that these two cytosolic proteins are substrates of FtsH (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B.

A. 1995; 92: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) suggests that the active site of FtsH for proteolysis is located within the cytosolic domain, which includes the ATPase region and zinc binding motif. Given this model, it seems likely that FtsH attacks cytosolic regions of SecY. Our genetic analysis of SecY-SecE interaction suggested that the fourth cytoplasmic region (C4) is important for the SecY interaction with SecE (3Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An essential region of SecE has also been localized to its cytoplasmic domain (35Murphy C.K. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2557-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of SecY and SecE may induce a structural change in the cytoplasmic regions of SecY, such that they become refractory to the attack of FtsH. We found that SecY-SecE complex in detergent extracts is far more resistant to even a non-specific protease (proteinase K) than singly overproduced SecY.2 The thermolability of the SecY-SecE complex in detergent extract (36Brundage L. Fimmel C.J. Mizushima S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4166-4170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) precluded the direct examination of its resistance to FtsH, but it is conceivable that overall conformation of the cytoplasmic domains determines the FtsH-resistance of SecY. We are in the process of identifying a SecY region that is primarily attacked by FtsH in a SecE-free state.As reported previously (7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the physiological significance of the SecY degradation by FtsH should lie in the elimination of unassembled SecY molecules that are harmful to the membrane functions. Taken together with our finding2 that subunit a of the proton ATPase F0 segment is also a substrate of FtsH, FtsH seems to comprise an important quality control machine in the E. coli cell.Our recent results (21Akiyama Y. Ito K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 711-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that FtsH can associate with the hflK and hflC gene products and that this association negatively regulates the SecY-degrading activity of FtsH suggest that the proteolytic activity of FtsH is subject to regulation by other proteins. The FtsH-His6-Myc preparations used in this study contained a trace of HflK/HflC proteins that could be detected immunologically.2 However, it should not affect the conclusions drawn in this paper because FtsH-His6-Myc that was purified from a strain where hflK and hflC were deleted showed essentially the same activity of SecY degradation (22Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The product of multi-copy suppressor gene, fdrA (37Akiyama Y. Ito K. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), could also have some regulatory role for the FtsH activities. Under the experimental conditions used in this work, the apparent proteolytic activity of FtsH was very low since we needed FtsH in high excess over the substrate SecY protein to demonstrate its proteolytic activity. The low activity may have been due to in vitro inactivation or a lack of some activating proteins. Alternatively, full proteolytic activity may require the membrane-integrated states, such that SecY and FtsH are properly oriented to each other. INTRODUCTIONThe components of machinery for protein secretion in Escherichia coli are encoded by the sec genes. The SecY protein is a central component of the membrane-embedded part of the secretion machinery, and functions in close interaction with other integral membrane proteins, SecE and SecG (1Nishiyama K.-i. Hanada M. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Douville K. Price A. Eichler J. Economou A. Wickner W. J. Biol.

Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that the SecY-SecE interaction is important not only for the functioning but also for the stable existence of the SecY protein (3Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T.

Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When an uncomplexed form of SecY is produced due to unbalanced expression of the secY and secE genes, it is rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation (6Taura T. Baba T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A mutated form of SecY, SecY24, in which SecY-SecE interaction has been mutationally impaired, is also degraded at 42°C (3Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).We previously reported that a membrane-bound ATPase, FtsH (HflB), is required for the degradation of the uncomplexed forms of SecY. In mutants with compromised FtsH functions, both overproduced SecY protein and the SecY24 mutant protein are stabilized (7Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). FtsH contains two transmembrane segments N-terminally located and a large cytoplasmic domain (8Tomoyasu T. Yamanaka K. Murata K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23485-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of FtsH includes a region that is homologous to the AAA ATPase family members involved in a variety of cellular processes (10Tomoyasu T. Yuki T. Morimura S. Mori H. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1344-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain contains a region homologous with a zinc protease sequence motif (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2551-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The transmembrane region is required for the oligomeric structure of FtsH (9Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23485-23490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The hflB mutation, known to increase lysogenization frequency of bacteriophage λ by stabilizing the cII protein, proved to be an allele of the ftsH gene (12Herman C. Ogura T. Tomoyasu T. Hiraga S.

Recently, an ATP-dependent protease activity of FtsH was described (11Tomoyasu T. Gamer J. Bukau B. Kanemori M. Mori H. Rutman A.J. Oppenheim A.B. Yura T. Yamanaka K. Niki H. Hiraga S. Ogura T.

It was shown that FtsH homologs (Yta10, Yta12, and Osd1/Yme1) in the yeast mitochondria also participate in degradation of some inner membrane proteins (14Pajic A. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W.

However, their proteolytic activities have not been characterized in vitro using purified proteins.In this work, we characterized FtsH with respect to its activities to hydrolyze ATP and to degrade the SecY protein.

Among other physiological processes, PCD plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the immune system. T-cells bearing T-cell receptors (TCR) able to recognize peptides from self proteins are generated in the thymus, but mature T-cells do not normally react against self-constituents and hence exhibit self-tolerance. Self-tolerance is therefore not an inherent feature of T lymphocytes but is acquired during development (negative selection or clonal deletion) (1Kappler J.W. Staerz U. White J. Marrack P.

Cell. 1987; 49: 273-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar), and the main process through which it is established involves elimination by apoptosis of self-reactive thymocytes and peripheral T-cells (4Smith C.A. Williams G.T. Kingston R. Jenkinson E.J. Owen J.J.T. Nature. 1989; 337: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 5Murphy K.M. Heimberger A.B. Loh D.Y.

Awad K.M. Reinherz E.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Foreign antigens, on the other hand, induce activation and expansion of antigen-specific peripheral T-cells followed, if the antigen stimulates a large fraction of T-cells and persists for a prolonged time, by their elimination (8Webb S. Morris C. Sprent J. Cell. 1990; 63: 1249-1256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 9Kawabe Y. Ochi A. J. Exp.

Nature. 1991; 353: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). This process, called activation-induced cell death, is essential to protect the organism against the deleterious effects of an uncontrolled T-cell expansion and subsequent production of toxic levels of cytokines. Disregulation of PCD in lymphoid cells can result in diseases such as cancer, AIDS, and autoimmune disorders. The pathological consequences of the malfunction of PCD are not limited to the immune system but can affect a number of cell types including neurons (12Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar).To better characterize the biochemical steps linking TCR stimulation to cell death, we have used the mouse T-cell hybridoma 3DO which, like other T-cell hybridomas (13Ashwell J.D. Cunningham R.E. Noguchi P.D. Hernandez D. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Shi Y. Szalay M.G. Paskar L. Boyer M. Singh B. Green D. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3326-3333PubMed Google Scholar), undergoes PCD when stimulated with an anti-TCR antibody. Fas ligand is induced following TCR triggering and the engagement of Fas by Fas ligand activates the cell death program (15Dhein J. Walczack H. Baumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 16Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. Green D.

Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Therefore, 3DO is a suitable in vitro model to study the molecular mechanisms of TCR-induced cell death. By means of a functional selection strategy, we have isolated, from an expression cDNA library, genes involved in apoptosis induced by TCR cross-linking in 3DO cells. The experimental system, called “death trap,” selects for cDNAs able to block death by: 1) expressing in the cells adequate levels of specific antisense RNAs or dominant negative mutants for “apoptotic” genes and 2) producing “anti-apoptotic” proteins. One of the transcripts identified, ALG-3 (18Vito P. Lacaná E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), was shown to be a truncated mouse homologue of the chromosome 1 familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene PS2 (19Levy-Lahad E.

Nature. 1995; 376: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). Expression of this partial RNA, potentially coding for the 103 COOH-terminal PS2 amino acids, rescued 3DO cells from T-cell receptor-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the induction of Fas ligand and the Fas-mediated death signal. Whether ALG-3 induced resistance to receptor-mediated cell death by being translated into a polypeptide and whether the endogenous PS2 protein was involved in PCD remained to be determined. In the present study we show that the Alzheimer's disease gene PS2 is required for cell death and that ALG-3 codes for a dominant negative mutant of PS2.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated a requirement for PS2 in some forms of PCD in both lymphoid and pheochromocytoma cells. PS2 function is opposed by ALG-3, an artificial truncated form of PS2 that encodes a COOH-terminal PS2 polypeptide. The involvement of PS2 in TCR-induced cell death suggests that this gene may play a role in negative selection and/or activation-induced cell death. In agreement with this hypothesis is also the fact that PS2 is expressed in both thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues. The generation of transgenic mice expressing ALG-3 in T-cells, in which PS2 should be functionally inactivated, and of PS2 null mice should address this question.The involvement of PS2 in the PCD pathway emphasizes the potential importance of PCD in the pathophysiology of AD. It has been recently shown that β-amyloid, a 42-amino acid peptide that derives from the proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein and accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, can cause apoptosis in a cell type-dependent fashion (26Loo D.T. Copani A. Pike C.J. Whittemore E.R. Walencewicz A.J. Cotman C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7951-7955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 27Gschwind M. Huber G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice expressing a transgenic β-amyloid peptide in neurons present extensive neuronal degeneration followed by apoptotic death (28LaFerla F.M. Tinkle B.T. Bieberich C.J. Haudenschild C.C. Jay G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition, in situ apoptosis has been described in Alzheimer's disease (29Su J.H. Anderson A.J. Cummings B.J. Cotman C.W. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 2529-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 30Lassmann H. Bancher C. Breitschopf H. Wegiel J. Bobinski M. Jellinger K. Wisniewski H.M. Acta Neuropathol. 1995; 89: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, a potential role for PCD in Alzheimer's disease has been proposed (31Cotman C.W. Anderson A.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 19-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is reinforced by the evidences that PS2 also participates in cell death of neuronally differentiated PC12 cells and that a PS2 mutation associated with Alzheimer's disease generates a molecule with constitutive apoptotic activity (32Wolozin B. Iwasaki K. Vito P. Ganjel J.K. Lacaná E. Sunderland T. Zhao B. Kusiak J.X. Wasco W. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).The PS2 protein has substantial structural and amino acid similarity with the chromosome 14 Alzheimer's disease gene product PS1. These two proteins share a 63% overall identity and are strikingly homologous in the COOH-terminal 103 amino acids (80% sequence identity) and are both predicted to be seven transmembrane domain proteins. Therefore, it has been postulated that PS1 and PS2 are functionally related and subserve the same biochemical pathway. However, overexpression of PS1 in the ALG-3.2 cell clone does not reconstitute sensitivity to TCR-induced cell death. It is possible that the two proteins are both necessary but not sufficient to carry out the apoptotic program. Alternatively, like members of the BCL-2/ced-9 gene family, PS1 and PS2 could regulate PCD in a coordinate but opposite fashion.

Signal-induced serine phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of IκBα target it for degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Recently, pervanadate, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, was shown to block the degradation of IκBα, thus inhibiting NF-κB activation. We investigated the mechanism by which pervanadate inhibits the degradation of IκBα. Western blot analysis of IκBα from tumor necrosis factor-treated cells revealed a slower migrating IκBα species that was subsequently degraded. However, pervanadate-treated cells also revealed a slower migrating species of IκBα that appeared in a time- and dose-dependent manner and was not degraded by tumor necrosis factor. The slower migrating species of IκBα from pervanadate-treated cells was tyrosine-phosphorylated as revealed by cross-reactivity with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, by the ability of the specific tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B to dephosphorylate it, and by phosphoamino acid analysis of IκBα immunoprecipitated from 32P-labeled cells. By site-specific mutagenesis and deletion analysis, we identified Tyr-42 on IκBα as the phosphoacceptor site. Furthermore, in an in vitro reconstitution system, tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα was protected from degradation. Our results demonstrate that inducible phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα are negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr-42, thus preventing NF-κB activation.

Like all members of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family, NF-κB has the unique property of being sequestered in its inactive state in the cytoplasm by a noncovalent association with inhibitory proteins called IκB (4Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). In mammalian species, at least seven structural homologs of IκB have been identified (4Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar), but only the IκBα form has been extensively studied. Recently, IκBα-deficient mice have been generated; they exhibit constitutive NF-κB activation, severe runting, dermatitis, extensive granulopoiesis, and neonatal death (5Beg A.A. Sha W.C.

Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Indeed, IκBα controls the activation of NF-κB by masking the nuclear localization signal located on the p50-p65 heterodimer of NF-κB (7Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv.

In response to a wide variety of stimuli besides TNF, IκBα undergoes degradation, allowing the p50-p65 heterodimer to migrate to the nucleus (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D.

The protein kinase involved in the inducible phosphorylation of IκBα has been shown to be part of a 700-kDa complex (20Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of this kinase remains elusive. Recently, reports from our laboratory (21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and another (22Menon S.D.

In this report, we examined the mechanism by which PV blocks the degradation of IκBα. We demonstrate that inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity by PV results in site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, which prevents its inducible phosphorylation and degradation and hence inhibits the activation of NF-κB. The cell lines employed in this study included ML-1a, a human myelomonoblastic leukemia cell line kindly provided by Dr. Ken Takeda (Showa University, Showa, Japan). U937, a human histiocytic lymphoma cell line, and HeLa, an epithelial carcinoma cell line, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). ML-1a and U937 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HeLa cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Recombinant bacterium-derived purified human TNF (5 × 107 units/mg) was a generous gift of Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Pervanadate was prepared fresh each time as described previously (21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-IκBα antiserum directed against the N and C termini and full-length IκBα were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad. Calpain inhibitor I (N-acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal (ALLN)), biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin were obtained from Sigma. Anti-FLAG antibody (monoclonal antibody M2) and anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose were obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Okadaic acid was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The plasmid pBS[SK(−)]-IκBα was a generous gift of Dr. P. Chiao (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX), and the plasmid pGEX-PTP1B-His of Dr. J. Weiner (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The plasmids pCMV4-FIκBα, pCMV4-FIκBα-Y42F, and pCMV4-FIκBαΔC (lacking residues 243-317) (23Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encode epitope-tagged derivatives of IκBα, were kindly provided by Dr. D. Ballard (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). HindIII and SmaI fragments generated from pCMV4-FIκBα (wild type), pCMV4-FIκBα-Y42F, and pCMV4-FIκBαΔC were cloned into the HindIII and SmaI sites of pBS[SK(−)] (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for preparing 35S-labeled, epitope-tagged IκBα protein. The FLAG-tagged IκBα genes cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV4 were transiently transfected into 50% confluent HeLa cells (1 μg of plasmid/100-mm dish) by Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. After 6 h, the medium was replaced by complete medium and left overnight. The transfected cells were pooled from plates and plated in 60-mm dishes overnight at 37°C. Approximately 40 h after transfection, the cells were treated as indicated, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared by the addition of lysis buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 30 min on ice, the samples were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min. Protein was estimated by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Approximately 40 μg of lysate was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody at 1 μg/ml and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG; the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). ML-1a or U937 cells (2 × 106) were treated as indicated, collected by centrifugation, and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Unless otherwise stated, all treatments with pervanadate were for 30 min at 37°C using a concentration of 100 μM. Lysates were prepared as described previously (21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Protein was estimated by the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Lysates (20-40 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) or polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) membranes. Western blot analysis was performed using the indicated antibodies, and blots were visualized by ECL. U937 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (DuPont NEN) and immunoprecipitated as described earlier (22Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) except that a mixture of antibodies generated against the N terminus, C terminus, and full-length IκBα was used. In vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled IκBα (see below) was used as a control for the migration of IκBα on SDS-PAGE. For phosphoamino acid analysis, immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (a large gel apparatus, 16 × 20 cm) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane containing phosphorylated IκBα was identified by autoradiography, excised, and subjected to acid hydrolysis followed by two-dimensional electrophoretic separation on thin-layer chromatography plates as described (25Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We used an in vitro reconstitution system similar to that described by Chen et al. (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9 (and references therein): 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). U937 cells were treated as described in the figure legends, and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described for Western blotting of IκBα except that okadaic acid was added to a final concentration of 3 μM and the supernatant was stored at −80°C. The typical protein concentration of these extracts was 10-20 μg/μl. In vitro transcribed and translated 35S-labeled, FLAG-tagged IκBα and mutants were generated using the TNT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) using pBS-IκBα or pBS-FIκBα plasmids as the template in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp). The reconstitution system contained 1-5 μl of 35S-labeled, FLAG-tagged IκBα that was incubated with cell extracts (200-400 μg) in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM ATP, 10 nM creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine kinase, and 3 μM okadaic acid). In one experiment, we omitted okadaic acid from the lysates and the reaction mixture, but included the kinase inhibitor isopentyladenine (26Vesely J. Havelicek L. Strnad M. Bow J.J. Donella-Deana A.

Aggarwal, unpublished observations. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C for the indicated times, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, and the protein was eluted by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were visualized by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) or by autoradiography and quantitated by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). The plasmid pGEX-PTP1B-His was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21. An overnight culture containing the transformed cells was used to inoculate 250 ml of Luria broth, grown to an A600 of 0.8, and induced with 0.5 mM isopropylthiogalactoside for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were collected and ruptured in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 500 μg of lysozyme for 30 min on ice. The lysate was sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was bound to 0.5 ml of Ni2+-agarose by batch chromatography in the presence of 25 mM imidazole for 1 h at 4°C. The Ni2+-agarose was washed with 12 ml of lysis buffer containing 1 M NaCl and 25 mM imidazole and then with 2 ml of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 50 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 M imidazole). The eluted protein (GST-PTP1B-His) was dialyzed overnight at 4°C against storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50% glycerol) and stored at −20°C. U937 cells were treated and lysates prepared as described (21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Lysates (20 μg) were mixed with 1 μg of purified GST-PTP1B-His or storage buffer and assayed in a 30-μl volume of protein-tyrosine phosphatase buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol in the presence or absence of 2 mM orthovanadate for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-IκBα antibodies as described above. Previously, we (21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and others (22Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) reported that inhibitors of protein-tyrosine phosphatases block the activation of NF-κB by a variety of inducers. In this report, we investigated the mechanism by which PV blocks this activation. We used human ML-1a, U937, and HeLa cells in this study since their response to various inducers of NF-κB is well characterized (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9 (and references therein): 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

We did not find any differences among these cell lines with regard to the inducible phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. To investigate the mechanism by which PV blocks the degradation of IκBα, we analyzed IκBα from ML-1a cells by Western blotting with IκBα-specific antibodies. Inducible phosphorylation of serines 32 and 36 of IκBα appears as a slow migrating band as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of cytoplasmic extracts (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9 (and references therein): 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar, 12Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 23Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, Western blot analysis showed that TNF caused a slower migrating species of IκBα to appear within 2 min, to be degraded in 5 min, and to reappear after 30 min (Fig. 1A, upper panel). However, when cells were pretreated with PV, the slower migrating species of IκBα appeared (Fig. 1A, lower panel), and this form of IκBα was not degraded upon further stimulation with TNF (lower panel). A dose-response analysis indicated that a PV concentration of 25 μM caused the slower migrating band to appear, and 100 μM PV converted all IκBα to the slower migrating species (Fig. 1B, upper panel). A time course analysis with 100 μM PV indicated that a 5-min treatment was sufficient to convert all IκBα to the slower migrating species (Fig. 1B, lower panel). The retardation of the migration of IκBα from PV-treated cells was attributed to phosphorylation since calf intestine alkaline phosphatase increased its mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). These observations indicated that PV treatment caused the phosphorylation of IκBα, which thus protected it from TNF-induced degradation. Since PV inhibits protein-tyrosine phosphatases and increases total protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cells (Ref. 22Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and data not shown), it may directly induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα. To explore this possibility, immunoprecipitated IκBα from control and PV-treated cells was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. IκBα immunoprecipitated from PV-treated cells, but not from control cells, was indeed tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). The tyrosine-phosphorylated band was confirmed to be the slower migrating species of IκBα by Western blot analysis using anti-IκBα antibodies (data not shown). Additionally, immunoprecipitation of IκBα from 32P-labeled cells revealed a slower migrating species of IκBα only from cells treated with PV (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that IκBα was constitutively phosphorylated at serine residues (Fig. 2C, left panel), most likely by casein kinase II (28Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7637-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 899-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); but in PV-treated cells, the slower migrating species was additionally phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue (Fig. 2C, right panel). Thus, the pervanadate-induced decrease in the mobility of IκBα was due to tyrosine (not serine) phosphorylation. To further examine the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on TNF-induced serine phosphorylation, we performed a Western blot analysis. However, like TNF-induced phosphorylation, PV-induced phosphorylation reduces the mobility of IκBα, thus making it difficult to distinguish the serine- and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms by Western blotting. To differentiate the phosphorylation of serine from that of tyrosine, we used a specific tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B (32Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6731-6737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which should reverse only the PV-induced decrease in the mobility of IκBα. The TNF-induced serine phosphorylation of IκBα was stabilized by pretreatment of the cells with ALLN, a specific protease inhibitor (9Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for 1 h prior to TNF stimulation. Additionally, to maintain serine phosphatases in their active state, we omitted okadaic acid in the preparation of these lysates. PTP1B treatment had no effect on IκBα from untreated or (ALLN + TNF)-treated cells (Fig. 3, lanes 1-6), but reversed the mobility of IκBα from PV- or (PV + TNF)-treated cells (lanes 8 and 11, respectively), suggesting that tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα is protected from the TNF-induced serine phosphorylation. We used orthovanadate as a control, and it inhibited the effect of PTP1B (Fig. 3, lanes 9 and 12, respectively). Besides inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα, pervanadate could also either inactivate the IκBα serine kinase or block an upstream activator of the IκBα serine kinase. This would require the localization of the tyrosine residue on IκBα that undergoes phosphorylation in response to PV. The mutation of this tyrosine residue, then, should overcome the inhibition of PV treatment without interfering with the serine kinase. IκBα contains eight tyrosine residues, including Tyr-42 at the N terminus; Tyr-181 and Tyr-195 in the fourth ankyrin repeat; and Tyr-248, Tyr-251, Tyr-254, Tyr-289, and Tyr-305 toward the C terminus (Fig. 4A) (33Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). All except Tyr-289 are conserved among IκBα species from human, chicken, rat, mouse, and pig (34deMartin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To identify the tyrosine residue phosphorylated by PV treatment, we used FLAG-tagged wild-type IκBα and various mutants in an in vitro reconstitution system as established by Chen et al. (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9 (and references therein): 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar); we observed no interference of epitope-tagged IκBα in this assay. Preliminary experiments indicated that incubation of 35S-labeled IκBα with lysates from PV-treated cells resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation as revealed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Both the wild type (WT) and a mutant lacking residues 243-317 (ΔC) showed a decrease in mobility when treated with PV extracts in the reconstitution system (Fig. 4B); the decrease was reversed by treatment with PTP1B, indicating tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). This suggested that the tyrosine phosphorylation site resided in the N terminus, thus eliminating five of the eight tyrosine residues as candidates. Of the three remaining tyrosine residues, only Tyr-42 is a potential phosphorylation site (33Haskill S. Beg A.A. Tompkins S.M. Morris J.S. Yurochko A.D. Sampson-Johannes A. Mondal K. Ralph P. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 1281-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). When a Y42F mutant was used, it did not shift in PV extracts in the reconstitution system, thus indicating that it was the potential site of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, we transiently transfected epitope-tagged wild-type and Y42F IκBα genes into HeLa cells and analyzed the expression of the IκBα proteins by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibodies: the FLAG-tagged Y42F IκBα mutant migrated faster than the wild type on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Upon PV treatment, FLAG-tagged wild-type IκBα, but not the Y42F mutant, decreased in mobility (Fig. 4C), providing evidence that this site was tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo. Because of overexpression, however, only a small portion of epitope-tagged IκBα was shifted in PV-treated cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, Tyr-42 is close to the inducible serine phosphorylation sites (serines 32 and 36) and ubiquitination sites (lysines 21 and 22) needed for the degradation of IκBα. Thus, it is possible that the phosphorylation of Tyr-42 stereochemically hindered subsequent phosphorylation by the inducible serine kinase. Because the IκBα-overexpressing HeLa cells lacked TNF responsiveness, our attempts to utilize these cells expressing epitope-tagged wild-type IκBα and the Y42F mutant were unsuccessful. Therefore, we used an in vitro reconstitution assay that contained cellular extracts, an ATP-regenerating system, and okadaic acid with wild-type IκBα or the Y42F IκBα mutant. 35S-Labeled, FLAG-tagged wild-type IκBα was phosphorylated and degraded in a time-dependent manner using this assay (Fig. 5A). In vitro translated 35S-labeled Y42F IκBα was mixed with either untreated or PV-treated cell lysates for 60 min as described for Fig. 5A, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by a PhosphorImager. The Y42F mutant was degraded similarly in extracts prepared from either untreated or PV-treated cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting a lack of effect of PV on the serine kinase. To further confirm that tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα is protected from degradation, we prepared a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of IκBα by first incubating 35S-labeled, epitope-tagged IκBα in extracts from PV-treated cells (similar to Fig. 4B) and then immunoprecipitating it with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose; we used the immunoprecipitate as the substrate in the in vitro reconstitution system with lysates prepared from untreated (control) or PV-treated cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated, 35S-labeled IκBα was protected from degradation in lysates prepared from PV-treated cells (Fig. 5C). However, >50% of the 35S-labeled IκBα was degraded in control lysates (Fig. 5C), the latter perhaps because tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα first underwent dephosphorylation at tyrosine, leading to subsequent serine phosphorylation and degradation. These results are consistent with the thesis that site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of residue 42 on IκBα protects it from inducible serine phosphorylation and thus inhibits its subsequent degradation. Since phosphorylation of serine residue 32 or 36 is a prerequisite for the subsequent ubiquitination of lysines 21 and 22 (8Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D.

A. 1995; 92: 11259-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), which targets IκBα for degradation, the mechanism of inhibition by pervanadate appears to be upstream of the ubiquitin machinery. This may explain why ubiquitin-conjugated forms of IκBα were not observed in cell lysates prepared from (PV + TNF)-treated U937 cells (data not shown). We have shown here that treatment of cells with PV results in site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα and that this phosphorylation protects it from degradation and hence inhibits the activation of NF-κB. While PV blocks the degradation of IκBα induced by a wide variety of inducers (21Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10631-10639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the data suggest a common inhibitory role for this tyrosine phosphorylation with all these inducers. It is plausible that a futile cycle occurs in which a protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphatase catalyze the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of IκBα in vivo. That would explain why we and others (22Menon S.D. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18881-18887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were not able to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα in unstimulated cells. It is possible that the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα in unstimulated cells is below the limits of detection due to an active protein-tyrosine phosphatase, but we were able to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated IκBα in vivo when protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity was abolished. Although Tyr-42 is conserved among all IκBα gene products known thus far, IκBβ does not contain an analogous tyrosine positioned near its inducible phosphorylation sites (6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Gosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Additionally, IκBβ is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon treatment with pervanadate.2 Like IκBα, however, IκBβ also appears to be regulated by phosphorylation and degradation (5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Gosh S.

Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),2 it is not able to cause the degradation of IκBβ in U937 cells.2 Thus, it appears that the ability of inducers to cause the degradation of IκBβ could be cell type-specific (5Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 6Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Gosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα may suggest an additional mechanism of regulation, one that affects IκBα, but not IκBβ. The block of IκBα and IκBβ degradation by specific proteasome inhibitors is a viable strategy for targeting the unwanted activation of NF-κB in inflammatory and immune responses. The molecular identity of the putative protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphatase suggested here may allow for the design of pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB activation. We thank Dr. P. J.

By probing the pore of the Kv1.3 channel with synthetic kaliotoxin-Lys27 mutants, each containing a non-natural lysine analog of a different length, and using mutant cycle analysis, we determined the spatial locations of Tyr400 and Asp402 in the GYGD motif, relative to His404 located at the base of the outer vestibule. Our data indicate that the terminal amines of the shorter Lys27 analogs lie close to His404 and to Asp402, while Lys27 itself interacts with Tyr400. Based on these data, we developed a molecular model of this region of the channel. The junction between the outer vestibule and the pore is defined by a ring (∼8-9-Å diameter) formed from alternating Asp402 and His404 residues. Tyr400 lies 4-6 Å deeper into the pore, and its interaction with kaliotoxin-Lys27 is in competition with K+ ions. Studies with dimeric Kv1.3 constructs suggest that two Tyr400 residues in the tetramer are sufficient to bind K+ ions.

These channels contain six putative transmembrane segments (S1 to S6) and a membrane-associated loop between S5 and S6 (P-region).

The scorpion toxins interact with all four subunits in the Kv1.3 tetramer, and the conserved toxin residue, Lys27, protrudes into the pore, possibly interacting with residues in the signature sequence (7Aiyar J.

In the present study, we have used this series of KTX-Lys27 mutants as a caliper to estimate the vertical distance between His404 in the external vestibule, and Tyr400 and Asp402, two residues contained within the signature sequence of Kv1.3. Using site-specific mutagenesis coupled with thermodynamic mutant cycle analysis (14Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 20Schreiber G.

Our data suggest that Asp402 and Tyr400 lie in a shallow depression at the center of a wide saucer-shaped outer vestibule. Based on these experimental data, we have developed a modified molecular model of the outer mouth of the Kv1.3 pore. The five KTX-Lys27 mutants have been described previously (7Aiyar J. Withka J.

Four of these contain positively charged non-natural lysine analogs of varying side chain lengths (DAP, 2.5 Å from Cα; DAB, 3.8 Å; Orn, 5.0 Å; ThLys 7.7 Å); the neutral non-natural amino acid, Nle27 (5.0 Å) replaced Lys27 (6.3 Å) in the fifth mutant. Another KTX mutant used in this study, R24D, was also described earlier (7Aiyar J. Withka J. Rizzi J. Dethlefs B. Simon M. Lee C.-L. Boyd J. Hall J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G.

The first batch was used for all the His404 mutant experiments; the second and third, slightly more potent batches were used for studies on the WT-D402N and WT-Y400V dimers and for the protonation experiments. WT Kv1.3 and six Kv1.3-H404 mutants (H404N, H404S, H404T, H404A, H404L, and H404V), have been described previously (7Aiyar J. Withka J. Rizzi J. Dethlefs B. Simon M. Lee C.-L. Boyd J. Hall J.

A WT-D402N dimer was generated by joining WT and D402N monomers, in frame, via a glutamine (Gln10) linker using a unique BamHI site. The linker was engineered into subunit I (WT Kv1.3) using the polymerase chain reaction. The two domains of the WT-Y400V dimer were linked by a serologically detectable MRGSH6 epitope via a unique BamHI restriction site. Kv1.3 cRNA (WT, mutant or dimer) were transcribed in vitro using a kit purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX) and injected into oocytes (Xenopus laevis purchased from Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) as described (21Soreq H. Seidman S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 225-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). K+ currents were measured at room temperature using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique (21Soreq H. Seidman S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 225-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and data analyzed using pClamp software (version 5.5.1, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA).

Note that although high ΔΔG values indicate tight interactions, failure to detect an energetically coupled interaction does not exclude the possibility of close proximity, since residues that are physically close may be energetically “silent.” This is especially true when random scanning mutagenesis is used to identify coupling (12Ranganathan R.

In all our experiments we have assumed that KTX and all its mutants sit in the vestibule with a similar geometry, with the side chains of residues at position 27 interacting with the pore in their fully extended conformation. For the purpose of comparison, the toxins containing positively charged residues at position 27 (DAP, DAB, Orn, Lys, ThLys) were treated as “WT” in the mutant cycle analyses and evaluated against a single mutant toxin containing the neutral residue, Nle. To create a model of the Kv1.3 pore, Phe425, Lys427, Thr449, Gly452, Phe453, and Trp454 in the model of the Shaker channel (3Guy H.R. Durell S.R. Farmbrough D.M.

Using mutant cycle analyses, we estimated the strength of interaction between His404 and each of terminal amines at KTX position 27. Examples of such experiments for a short (DAP27) and long (Lys27) residue are shown in Fig. 1A (Kd values in Table I). Replacing His404 with the hydrophobic valine (H404V), strongly perturbed the interaction of the short analog with the pore (Ω = 150), but not that of the longer analog (Ω = 3.4; Fig. 1A). These results suggest that His404 and KTX-DAP lie close to one another.Table I.Kd values for blocks of Kv1.3 mutants with the various KTX Lys27 analogsLys27 AnalogsDAPDABOrnLysThlysNleWT Kv1.3aThree batches of toxins were used in the study, each with slightly differing potency0.24 (0.13)0.17 (0.14)0.14 (0.05)0.10 (0.1)0.82 (0.66)52 (27)H404A25 (3.5)33 (4.2)27 (9.8)0.72 (0.11)2.80 (1.0)160 (46)H404L520 (198)390 (82)440 (56)28 (2)49 (14.2)610 (37)H404V36 (8.5)34 (9)35 (11)0.33 (0.15)1.1 (0.8)51 (22)H404T11 (3.5)13 (3.9)14 (8.2)0.33 (0.26)0.46 (0.17)36 (7.8)H404S8.0 (6.2)6.5 (4.8)39 (23)0.85 (0.07)2.0 (0.63)130 (36)H404N31.7 (12)44.6 (4)19.2 (1)38.2 (14)18.8 (4.8)1100 (127)H404Y0.27 (0.14)0.41 (0.35)0.48 (0.45)0.03 (0.03)0.07 (0.01)0.17 (0.02)H404, pH 6.8aThree batches of toxins were used in the study, each with slightly differing potency0.65 (0.20)1.3 (0.50)0.34 (0.04)1.4 (0.27)0.82 (0.27)155 (56)H404, pH 654 (16.6)40 (16.8)9.9 (4.1)15 (5.5)27 (6.0)210 (45)WT Kv1.3aThree batches of toxins were used in the study, each with slightly differing potency0.13 (0.1)0.17 (0.12)0.13 (0.05)0.04 (0.02)0.33 (0.15)22 (5)WT-D402N16 (5.6)18 (2.5)2.0 (0.8)0.38 (0.07)1.7 (0.3)140 (119)WT-Y400V1.5 (0.42)2.5 (0.72)0.38 (0.05)2.5 (0.61)3.6 (1.35)110 (32)a Three batches of toxins were used in the study, each with slightly differing potency Open table in a new tab A more extensive mutagenesis study supported this conclusion (Fig. 1B, Table I). Mutant cycle experiments involving various hydrophobic substitutions at channel position 404 produced larger Ω values for the toxins containing the shorter Lys27 analogs (DAP27, DAB27, Orn27) than did polar replacements (Asn, Ser, Thr); none of these His404 mutations significantly altered Ω values for the longer analogs, Lys27 and ThLys27 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that His404 might hydrogen-bond with the terminal amines of the shorter KTX-Lys27 analogs, since this interaction is maintained by polar, but not hydrophobic, substitutions. If the short analogs are close to His404 as these data suggest, protonation of His404, brought about by changing the external pH from 6.8 to 6.0 (7Aiyar J. Withka J. Rizzi J. Dethlefs B. Simon M. Lee C.-L. Boyd J. Hall J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), would be expected to reduce their potency via electrostatic repulsion of the terminal amine at position 27; such an effect should be less pronounced for the longer toxin-lysine 27 analogs that do not interact energetically with His404. To test this idea, we performed mutant cycle experiments, measuring the Kd values for each of the KTX-Lys27 analogs on the WT-Kv1.3 channel at either pH 6.8 or 6.0. As predicted, protonation of His404 disrupted its interaction with the shorter analogs to a greater extent than the longer analogs (Fig. 1B, Table I). The ΔΔG values for each of the Kv1.3-H404V-KTX-X27Nle mutant cycles (where X = DAP, DAB, Orn, Lys, or ThLys), derived from the Ω values in Fig. 1, A and B, were plotted against the length of the side chain at toxin residue 27 (Fig. 1C). Based on the criterion of Schreiber and Fersht (20Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), we assume that a coupling energy value of >=0.6 kcal mol− 1The abbreviations used are: KTXkaliotoxinWTwild-typeDAPdiaminopropionic acidDABdiaminobutyric acidOrnornithineThLysthiohomolysineNlenorleucine. corresponds to an inter-residue distance of <=5 Å for a given pair of interacting toxin-channel residues. The ΔΔG values were highest for the shorter analogs, and these values diminished as the length of the side chain at toxin-position 27 increased (Fig. 1C). This molecular yardstick places His404, within 5 Å of the terminal amines in the shorter KTX-Lys27 analogs. kaliotoxin wild-type diaminopropionic acid diaminobutyric acid ornithine thiohomolysine norleucine. The highly conserved aspartate in the signature sequence of Kv channels, Asp402 in Kv1.3, has long been an attractive candidate for a salt-bridge interaction with Lys27. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to test this idea, since mutations of Asp402 result in non-functional channels. We circumvented this problem by using a dimeric construct consisting of one wild-type and one mutant (D402N) subunit, which yielded a functional channel in which the overall negative charge at position 402 is halved. The WT-D402N dimer (Fig. 2A, center) inactivates more rapidly than the WT Kv1.3 channel (Fig. 2A, left). Dose-response curves demonstrate that all five toxins containing positively charged residues at position 27 blocked the WT Kv1.3 channel with almost equal potency (Fig. 2B, left; Table I), while the WT-D402N dimer was significantly less sensitive to DAP27 and DAB27 than to the longer analogs (Fig. 2B, middle; Table I). The neutral KTX-Nle27 toxin mutant blocked WT Kv1.3 and the dimer with substantially lower potency than the positively charged KTX-Lys27 forms (Table I). The ΔΔG values obtained from mutant cycle experiments (Fig. 1C) represent strong interactions between Asp402 and the shorter KTX-Lys27 analogs, indicating that Asp402, like His404, must lie within 5 Å of the terminal amines in the shorter KTX-Lys27 analogs. Tyr400 in the signature sequence is highly conserved among all cloned K+ channels, regardless of their gating behavior, and has been suggested to play a role in K+ ion selectivity (reviewed in Refs. 1Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. North A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: Ligand and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 1-71Google Scholar, 6MacKinnon R.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 717-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, and 9). Mutant cycle experiments were used to assess the interaction between each of the KTX-Lys27 analogs and Tyr400 in the K+ channel signature sequence. For this purpose, we generated a Kv1.3 dimer containing one WT subunit and a second Y400V domain; the same substitution at the homologous position in Shaker (Y445V) has been reported to produce a K+-selective channel (10Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). The WT-Y400V dimer inactivated rapidly (Fig. 2A, right) and was completely blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, by all five toxins containing positively charged residues at position 27 (Fig. 2B, right). Mutant cycle analysis demonstrated that Tyr400 lies within 5 Å of the terminal amine in KTX-Lys27 (Fig. 1C), a result consistent with a recent report that placed Lys27 of agitoxin-2 in close proximity to Tyr445 in Shaker (12Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The decreased blocking potency of KTX (Fig. 2B, right; Table I) on the dimer (which contains only two tyrosines) also suggests that optimal binding of KTX requires more than two Tyr400 residues in the tetramer. Earlier work on the Shaker channel suggested that Lys27 in agitoxin-2 interacted with a residue at or close to a K+ ion binding site within the pore (12Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar); occupation of this site by a K+ ion destabilized the toxin interaction with the channel via electrostatic repulsion of Lys27 (12Ranganathan R. Lewis J.H. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Similarly, K+ competitively inhibited the interaction between Lys27 in charbydotoxin and residues in the pore of the “maxi” calcium-activated K+ channel (25Park C-S. Miller C. Neuron. 1992; 9: 307-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26MacKinnon R. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Since Kv1.3-Tyr400 is close to KTX-Lys27, it is a good candidate for such a K+ ion binding site. We examined the effect of changing the external K+ concentration from 2 to 100 mM on the blocking potency of KTX-Lys27 or KTX-Nle27 on either the WT channel or the WT-Y400V dimer. If Tyr400 is a K+ binding site, its interaction with KTX-Lys27, but not KTX-Nle27, should be disrupted as the K+ ion concentration in the pore increases. Results with the WT-Y400V dimer will depend on whether K+ binds to all four residues in the tetramer or whether two will suffice. For example, if two tyrosines are sufficient for binding K+, then increasing the K+ concentration in the pore should competitively inhibit KTX-Lys27 binding to the dimer and consequently produce a high ΔΔG value by mutant cycle analysis. Alternatively, if four tyrosines participate in K+ binding, then halving the number (as in our dimer), would diminish the channel's affinity for K+ ions and reduce the ability of external K+ to compete with KTX-Lys27 for Tyr400. The mutant cycle experiments presented in Fig. 2C favor the first alternative. As shown in Fig. 2C (left), increasing external K+ concentration reduced by 6-fold, the potency of KTX-Lys27 on the WT Kv1.3 channel, and this effect was even more pronounced (38-fold) on the WT-Y400V dimer. The ΔΔG value (1 kcal mol− 1The abbreviations used are: KTXkaliotoxinWTwild-typeDAPdiaminopropionic acidDABdiaminobutyric acidOrnornithineThLysthiohomolysineNlenorleucine.) for this mutant cycle suggests that KTX-Lys27 and K+ ions have identical or overlapping binding sites (Tyr400) within the pore. As expected, block by KTX-Nle27 (Fig. 2C, right) was not dependent on the concentration of K+ ions in the pore (ΔΔG = 0.1 kcal mol− 1The abbreviations used are: KTXkaliotoxinWTwild-typeDAPdiaminopropionic acidDABdiaminobutyric acidOrnornithineThLysthiohomolysineNlenorleucine.).

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) the entrance to the ion conduction pathway was formed by an alternating ring of Met403 and His404 residues. The GYGD motif was positioned vertically below this ring, lining the cylinder constituting the ion conduction pathway, with Asp402 and Tyr400 located 4-5 Å and 10-11 Å below His404, respectively. We have modified this model based on the additional structural constraints imposed by our new experimental data. In the present model, Asp402 has been pulled closer to the external vestibule so that the carboxyl group lies in the same horizontal plane as His404, resulting in a ring (8-9-Å diameter) of four alternating His404 residues and Asp402 residues (Fig. 3A). The sulfur atom of Met403 is located 3 Å farther away from the central axis in this modified model, while the four Tyr400 residues lie 4-6 Å below both Asp402 and His404 with their aromatic side chains protruding into the pore (Fig. 3B). In this model, the external vestibule has a shallow saucer shape with the selectivity filter forming a ∼5-Å central depression. We docked KTX (Fig. 3) into the modified vestibule to confirm the feasibility of the experimentally determined interactions and to predict new ones. Docking was achieved by guiding the KTX-Lys27 residue into the center of the pore and then rotating the toxin around the central axis of the pore until Arg24 was aligned with Asp386. This docking configuration (Fig. 3A) does not violate any of the previously reported toxin-channel interactions, including Arg24-Asp386, Asn30-Asp386, Ser11-His404, Phe25-His404, Met29-His404, and Thr36-His404 (7Aiyar J.

In summary, using a series of KTX-Lys27 mutants as molecular yardsticks, we have determined the spatial location of two residues in the K+ channel signature motif (Asp402 and Tyr400), relative to a third residue, His404, in the external vestibule of Kv1.3 (7Aiyar J.

Our results indicated that while the down-regulation of novel PKC (nPKC) and conventional PKC (cPKC) by pretreatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-actetate cannot block UVB-induced AP-1 activity, it can block 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-induced AP-1 activity. Further, the dominant negative mutant PKCλ/ι blocked UVB-induced AP-1 activity in all doses and time courses studied. In contrast, UVB-induced AP-1 activity from cells devoid of EGF receptor (B82) was not significantly different from that of the stable transfectants with a kinase-deficient EGF receptor (B82M721) or those with a wild-type EGF receptor (B82L) at all UVB irradiation doses and time courses studied. All of this evidence indicated that aPKC, but not EGF receptor, is involved in UVB-induced AP-1 activation. The exposure of mammalian cells to UV irradiation leads to the activation of transcription factors such as activated protein-1 (AP-1) and NFκB.

https://openalex.org/W2083831481,"In response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), Stat1 enters the nucleus, where it activates transcription. In order to better understand the mechanism of the extracellular signal-induced protein import into the nucleus, we have established an in vivo assay system that uses recombinant Stat1 protein as a model transport substrate. Using this system, we found that Stat1 is actively transported through the nuclear pores in an IFN-gamma-dependent manner and tyrosine (Tyr701) phosphorylation of Stat1 is actually required for its nuclear import. When the antibody against Ran, which was identified as an essential factor for active nuclear protein transport, was injected, the IFN-gamma-dependent nuclear transport of Stat1 was completely inhibited. Furthermore, nuclear import of Stat1 was suppressed by microinjection of two mutant Ran proteins, one defective in GTP hydrolysis (G19V) and the other with little or no binding to GTP (T24N), both of which are known to act as dominant negative inhibitors of nuclear import. These results indicate that the conditional nuclear import of Stat1 requires GTP hydrolysis by Ran."

One function of Il-1 in the brain appears to be the stimulation of astrocytes to proliferate and produce a variety of cytokines and trophic factors, including nerve growth factor. The mechanisms by which Il-1 exerts its actions on astrocytes remain poorly defined. We present evidence that this cytokine elicits activation of the NFκB transcription factor and that this transcription factor mediates effects of Il-1 on nerve growth factor mRNA expression.

NGF is a member of a family of neurotrophic factors, called neurotrophins, which includes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5). Each of these factors is expressed in distinct cellular populations in the brain, both neuronal and glial, and influences specific responsive target cells. NGF is most highly expressed in the hippocampus (9Large T.H. Bodary S.C. Clegg D.O. Weskamp G. Otten U. Reichardt L.F.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 318-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), astrocytes express high levels of NGF mRNA and protein. The induction of glial NGF expression by lesions in the peripheral nervous system was shown to be dependent on interleukin-1 (15Lindholm D. Heumann R. Meyer M. Thoenen H. Nature. 1987; 330: 658-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This cytokine was subsequently demonstrated to influence NGF expression in CNS glial cells as well (6Friedman W.J. Larkfors L. Ayer-LeLievre C. Ebendal T. Olson L. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Spranger M. Lindholm D. Bandtlow C. Heumann R. Gnahn H. Naher-Noe M.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The transduction mechanisms by which Il-1 influences NGF expression have remained largely undefined. The signaling pathway does not appear to involve cAMP, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol turnover, or mobilization of intracellular calcium (16Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activation of c-fos (16Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the presence of an AP-1 site in the NGF promoter (17Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.W. Thoenen H. Proc.

Neurosci. 1991; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggested a potential role for this transcription factor in mediating Il-1 stimulation of NGF. Alternatively, the recent identification of the sphingomyelin pathway, leading ultimately to activation of NFκB transcriptional activity by Il-1 and TNF (19Mathias S. Younes A. Kan C.-C. Orlow I. Joseph C. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1993; 259: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 20Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), suggested that this pathway might mediate actions of Il-1 in astrocytes.Cytokine stimulation of gene expression in a variety of cell types is mediated, at least in part, through activation of NFκB transcription factors (21Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). This has been particularly well studied in cells of the immune system, where the NFκB/rel transcription factor family plays a major role in lymphoid differentiation and activation (reviewed in Refs. 22Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 23Koop E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Transcriptionally active protein dimers in the nucleus activate gene transcription by binding to a κB sequence motif in the promoter of responsive genes. Inactive proteins are retained in the cytoplasm as unprocessed precursor proteins (p100 or p105) or as part of an inactive complex containing inhibitor molecules such as the IκB's. Upon stimulation, the inhibitory molecules are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, freeing the NFκB dimers to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The transcriptionally active NFκB dimer may consist of hetero- and homodimers of the five NFκB/rel proteins or may include novel tissue-specific proteins that recognize κB binding sequences (24Cauley K. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Multiple combinations may exist even within a single cell type. Since numerous cellular genes are transcriptionally regulated by NFκB, the specificity of target gene activation by a given stimulus in a particular cell may be determined in part by the dimer composition. Genes activated by the NFκB/rel transcription factors include those encoding cytokines (Il-1, Il-2, Il-6, Il-8, TNFα, and β-interferon), histocompatibility antigens, and other cellular proteins (e.g. macrophage NO synthase (25Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar)).NFκB transcription factors have been shown to play an important role in mediating lymphocyte and macrophage cellular responses to a variety of cytokines (22Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Koop E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Recently, Il-1 has also been shown to induce NFκB in astrocytes (2Sparacio S.M. Zhang Y. Vilcek J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 39: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and astrocytoma cell lines (26Swingler S. Morris A. Easton A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In these studies we have examined whether the NFκB transcription factors play a role in mediating astrocyte activation and nerve growth factor induction by cytokines.DISCUSSIONIn these studies we have shown that cytokine stimulation of hippocampal astrocytes increased nerve growth factor expression via an NFκB-dependent pathway. Il-1 treatment induced nuclear NFκB translocation and DNA binding activity. The binding complex consisted of p50/p65 heterodimers as shown by supershift experiments. Several lines of evidence suggested that regulation of NGF expression was correlated with NFκB activation. The inability of cycloheximide, as well as the ability of the antioxidant PDTC, to prevent the Il-1-induced elevation of NGF mRNA, were both consistent with an NFκB-dependent signaling pathway. Moreover, the slight induction of NGF mRNA by CHX alone may be due to the inhibition of IκB synthesis by CHX and is characteristic of NFκB-dependent genes. We investigated the possible role of this transcription factor directly by blocking NFκB activity, either by competing for κB binding or with antisense oligonucleotides to p50 and p65. Inhibition of NFκB prevented the Il-1-induced increase in NGF mRNA. Thus, we have shown that a critical transcription factor, known to mediate cytokine actions in a variety of cell types, is activated in brain astrocytes and mediates induction of trophic factors as well as cytokines. The NGF gene has a complex structure and the promoter has not been well characterized. However, the presence of an AP-1 site in the first intron (17Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.W. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3899-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 18D'Mello S.R. Heinrich G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1991; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated and has implicated this transcription factor in mediating regulation of NGF expression (17Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.W. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3899-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 18D'Mello S.R. Heinrich G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1991; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Specifically, c-fos seems to be critically involved in the lesion-induced elevation in NGF mRNA in fibroblasts of the sciatic nerve (17Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.W. Thoenen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3899-3902Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, the ability of the antioxidant PDTC to prevent the Il-1 induction of NGF in astrocytes does not support an AP-1-dependent pathway. AP-1 is not activated by reactive oxygen intermediates (37Schreck R. Rieber P. Bauerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar), therefore an AP-1-dependent pathway would not be blocked by the antioxidant treatment. Moreover, the activation of transcription factors and regulation of gene expression may differ in distinct cell types and in response to different stimuli. Recently, the presence of an NFκB site has been demonstrated in the promoter of the human NGF gene. 2P. Baecker (Roche Biosciences), personal communication. An analogous NFκB site is present in the mouse NGF promoter (GCG data base, locus MUSNGFX, accession number M33683, base pairs 1163-1172). The κB sequence from the human NGF promoter has exhibited binding activity in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and shows supershifted bands in the presence of p50 and p65 antibodies.2 Thus, the regulation of NGF mRNA which we have observed to be mediated by NFκB in astrocytes is probably due to an analogous site in the rat NGF promoter.The NFκB/rel family of transcription factors plays a critical role in mediating cellular activation by cytokines. The functional importance of these transcription factors has been well demonstrated in lymphocytes (22Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Koop E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 44Bauerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). In the brain, response to injury and disease is not mediated by the immune system as in the periphery. Lymphocytes and macrophages cannot enter the CNS unless the blood-brain barrier is compromised. Specialized glial cell types within the brain appear to have functions analogous to peripheral macrophages and lymphocytes. Microglia are phagocytic cells within the CNS. These cells proliferate and aggregate at the site of a lesion, release a variety of cytokines such as Il-1, and are considered to be the macrophages of the brain. Astrocytes also become activated by injury and can express MHC antigens (4Benveniste E.N. Blalock J.E. Neuroimmunoendocrinology.Vol. 52. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1992: 106-153Google Scholar) and produce a variety of cytokines and trophic factors. This ability may provide an important beneficial environment for neurons consequent to a lesion or disease process. The mechanisms governing astrocyte activation by cytokines such as Il-1 remain poorly understood, although Il-6 induction in astrocytes is mediated by NFκB (2Sparacio S.M. Zhang Y. Vilcek J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 39: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that the NFκB transcription factors may critically mediate additional astrocyte responses to cytokines, including, importantly, induction of trophic factors. Thus, NFκB may function as a common pathway in the pleiotropic astrocyte response to cytokines in the CNS.The NFκB/rel transcription factors may serve a number of different roles in the CNS. In addition to mediating the effects of cytokines on astrocytes, constitutive nuclear NFκB has been identified in neurons (45Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3981-3992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to be responsible for the high levels of HIV LTR promoter activity that can be seen in these cells (46Rattner A. Korner M. Walker M.D. Citri Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 47Kaltschmidt B. Bauerle P.A. Kaltschmidt C. Mol. Aspects Med. 1993; 14: 171-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Neuronal NFκB has been proposed to play a role in normal neuronal gene expression (45Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3981-3992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although induction of this transcription factor may also be associated with CNS pathology. The neuronal toxicity of the amyloid β protein was found to correlate with its ability to induce hydrogen peroxide and NFκB (48Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar). NFκB has also been proposed to play a role in other CNS disorders whose pathogenesis involves damage due to oxygen free radicals. Based on our results and those of others (2Sparacio S.M. Zhang Y. Vilcek J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 39: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that some of the pathologic changes associated with CNS inflammatory processes, such as astrocyte activation, may also be the result of NFκB induction. Although some of these changes, such as NGF induction, may be beneficial in the short term, a prolonged inflammatory process may lead to severe CNS pathology.The production of trophic factors consequent to a lesion may have a critical impact on surrounding neuronal populations. Lesions of the fimbria-fornix, the pathway connecting the basal forebrain and hippocampus, normally results in extensive cell death in the basal forebrain. Several groups have shown that infusion of NGF after a fimbria-fornix lesion can rescue cholinergic basal forebrain neurons (49Hefti F. Dravid A. Hartikka J. Brain Res. 1984; 293: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 50Williams L.R. Varon S. Peterson G.M. Wictorin K. Björklund A. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2986-2999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Although fimbria transection results in a local increase in hippocampal NGF mRNA and protein (52Whittemore S.R. Lärkfors L. Ebendal T. Holets V.R. Ericsson A. Persson H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 244-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Lärkfors L. Strömberg I. Ebendal T. Olson L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 18: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the levels of trophic factor that are induced may not be sufficient to prevent the extensive cell death that occurs after a lesion. One possibility is that under conditions of mild trauma, NGF induction in astrocytes may be sufficient to maintain neuronal survival and function; however, upon excessive damage, such as transection of the pathway, additional trophic support is required. Other conditions that compromise the NGF-responsive basal forebrain cholinergic population include progressive diseases such as Alzheimers, in which this population is among the earliest to degenerate, leading to severe memory deficits (54Hefti F. Weiner W.J. Ann. Neurol. 1986; 20: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Animal models using aged rats with memory deficits have shown that NGF is depleted in these animals (55Lärkfors L. Ebendal T. Whittemore S.R. Persson H. Hoffer B. Olson L. Mol. Brain Res. 1987; 3: 55-60Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 56Fischer W. Gage F.H. Björklund A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1989; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and that NGF treatment improves performance on memory tasks (57Fischer W. Wictorin K. Björklund A. Williams L.R. Varon S. Gage F.H. Nature. 1987; 329: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NGF is currently in clinical use for treatment of Alzheimer patients (58Olson L. Nordberg A. von Holst H. Bäckman L. Ebendal T. Alafuzoff I. Amberla K. Hartvig P. Herlitz A. Lilja A. Lundquist H. LŚngström B., Meyerson B. Persson A. Viitanen M. Winblad B. Seiger Å. J. Neural Transm. 1992; 4: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Therefore, availability of trophic factors to responsive neurons when they are compromised by lesion or disease may critically influence continued survival and function. Thus, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that mediate NGF induction and to be able to exploit these mechanisms to maximize trophic factor production under appropriate circumstances.

Neurosci. 1991; 11: 318-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), astrocytes express high levels of NGF mRNA and protein. The induction of glial NGF expression by lesions in the peripheral nervous system was shown to be dependent on interleukin-1 (15Lindholm D. Heumann R. Meyer M. Thoenen H. Nature. 1987; 330: 658-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This cytokine was subsequently demonstrated to influence NGF expression in CNS glial cells as well (6Friedman W.J. Larkfors L.

Neurochem. 1991; 56: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The transduction mechanisms by which Il-1 influences NGF expression have remained largely undefined. The signaling pathway does not appear to involve cAMP, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol turnover, or mobilization of intracellular calcium (16Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activation of c-fos (16Friedman W.J. Altiok N. Fredholm B.B. Persson H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the presence of an AP-1 site in the NGF promoter (17Hengerer B. Lindholm D. Heumann R. Ruther U. Wagner E.W. Thoenen H. Proc.

Neurosci. 1991; 2: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggested a potential role for this transcription factor in mediating Il-1 stimulation of NGF. Alternatively, the recent identification of the sphingomyelin pathway, leading ultimately to activation of NFκB transcriptional activity by Il-1 and TNF (19Mathias S. Younes A. Kan C.-C. Orlow I. Joseph C. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1993; 259: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 20Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), suggested that this pathway might mediate actions of Il-1 in astrocytes.Cytokine stimulation of gene expression in a variety of cell types is mediated, at least in part, through activation of NFκB transcription factors (21Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). This has been particularly well studied in cells of the immune system, where the NFκB/rel transcription factor family plays a major role in lymphoid differentiation and activation (reviewed in Refs. 22Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 23Koop E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Transcriptionally active protein dimers in the nucleus activate gene transcription by binding to a κB sequence motif in the promoter of responsive genes. Inactive proteins are retained in the cytoplasm as unprocessed precursor proteins (p100 or p105) or as part of an inactive complex containing inhibitor molecules such as the IκB's. Upon stimulation, the inhibitory molecules are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, freeing the NFκB dimers to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription. The transcriptionally active NFκB dimer may consist of hetero- and homodimers of the five NFκB/rel proteins or may include novel tissue-specific proteins that recognize κB binding sequences (24Cauley K. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Multiple combinations may exist even within a single cell type. Since numerous cellular genes are transcriptionally regulated by NFκB, the specificity of target gene activation by a given stimulus in a particular cell may be determined in part by the dimer composition. Genes activated by the NFκB/rel transcription factors include those encoding cytokines (Il-1, Il-2, Il-6, Il-8, TNFα, and β-interferon), histocompatibility antigens, and other cellular proteins (e.g. macrophage NO synthase (25Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar)).NFκB transcription factors have been shown to play an important role in mediating lymphocyte and macrophage cellular responses to a variety of cytokines (22Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Koop E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Recently, Il-1 has also been shown to induce NFκB in astrocytes (2Sparacio S.M. Zhang Y. Vilcek J. Benveniste E.N. J. Neuroimmunol. 1992; 39: 231-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and astrocytoma cell lines (26Swingler S. Morris A. Easton A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In these studies we have examined whether the NFκB transcription factors play a role in mediating astrocyte activation and nerve growth factor induction by cytokines."

https://openalex.org/W2037664321,"The mechanisms by which chemokines bind and signal through their receptors are complex and poorly understood. In the present study, we sought to dissect these processes and to map important functional domains of the two CXC chemokine (interleukin-8) receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), using blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the receptors and a series of chimeras between CXCR1 and CXCR2. A panel of specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2, generated by immunizing mice with transfectants expressing either receptor, were shown to effectively block IL-8- and/or growth-related oncogene α (GROα) -mediated ligand binding, chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1 and CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Of particular interest was an anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9, that inhibited chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding but had no detectable effects on ligand binding. The epitopes of these blocking mAbs were mapped by using a series of CXCR1/2 chimera transfectants and synthetic peptides.

The epitope of mAb 7D9 mainly involved a region within the first 45 residues of CXCR1, and it appeared to be conformation-sensitive.

Moreover, the ligand binding and chemotaxis properties of each CXCR1/2 chimeric receptor to IL-8 and GROα were determined. It was found that each is distinct in its ability to confer ligand binding and chemotactic response to IL-8 and GROα, and two conclusions could be made. 1) The N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity, consistent with previous studies using rabbit/human CXCR1/2 chimeras; and 2) the specificity determinant for GROα binding in CXCR2 involves sequences in the N terminus, distal to the first 15 residues, as well as other parts of the receptor.

INTRODUCTIONChemokines (chemoattractant cytokines) play an important role in leukocyte trafficking to inflammatory sites. For example, interleukin-8 (IL-8) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8Interleukin-8GROαgrowth-related oncogene αCXCR1CXC chemokine receptor 1 (IL-8RA)CXCR2CXC chemokine receptor 2 (IL-8RB)mAbmonoclonal antibodywtwild-typeaaamino acidFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pairs. is one of the most potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and is produced by many cell types in response to inflammatory stimuli. It induces angiogenesis, mediates cytokine-induced transendothelial neutrophil migration, and triggers a variety of other effects associated with the inflammatory response (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence indicating that in vivo IL-8 can initiate neutrophil infiltration to the site of inflammation, causing tissue injury. In animal models of acute inflammation such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acid induced lung injury, anti-IL-8 antibodies have produced beneficial effects in reducing inflammatory tissue damage and improving survival (2Sekido N. Mukaida N. Harada A. Nakanishi I. Watanabe Y. Matsushima K. Nature. 1993; 365: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 3Broaddus V.C. Boylan A.M. Hoeffel J.M. Kim K.J. Sadick M. Chuntharapai A. Hebert C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2960-2967PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mulligan M.S. Jones M.L. Bolanowski M.A. Baganoff M.P. Deppeler C.L. Meyers D.M. Ryan U.S. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5585-5595PubMed Google Scholar). All these data support the notion that if the IL-8 activities could be specifically controlled in humans, we may be able to prevent injuries caused by infiltrating neutrophils and other inflammatory cells. For such purposes, a better understanding of how IL-8 binds and signals with its receptors will certainly help us develop potent receptor antagonists.Two distinct types of IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), have been cloned and sequenced (5Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 6Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). These two subtypes share about 74% amino acid identity. Their transmembrane regions and intracellular loops are extremely similar while the N- and C-terminal regions are very different. The IL-8 receptors, and other chemokine receptors, belong to a family of seven-transmembrane or “serpentine” receptors that interact with GTP-binding proteins to elicit various biological responses (7Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 8Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12783-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These two IL-8 receptors display overlapping but distinct ligand specificities. CXCR1 binds IL-8 with high affinity, but not other chemokines, while CXCR2 binds with high affinity to other CXC chemokines such as GROα, NAP-2, as well as IL-8. The functional significance of such selectivity is not clear since on peripheral blood cells, where most of the IL-8 activities have been observed, these two receptors are expressed at similar levels on neutrophils and subsets of lymphocytes.The interaction between IL-8 and its receptors seems to be complex. A number of functional domains on the IL-8 molecule have been identified as essential for this interaction. Results obtained from mutagenesis and synthetic analogs of IL-8 demonstrated that residues Glu4−Leu5−Arg6 of IL-8 were necessary, but not sufficient, for high affinity binding and activities (9Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies identified a second region, comprising residues that cluster near a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket, that is important for IL-8 function (13Hammond M.E.W. Shyamala V. Siani M.A. Gallegos C.A. Feucht P.H. Abbott J. Lapointe G.R. Moghadam M. Khoja H. Zakel J. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Biol.

Price L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9579-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This region contains a second site for IL-8 receptor recognition that, in combination with the Glu4−Leu5−Arg6 region, can modulate receptor binding affinity and specificity.The IL-8 receptors may also provide multiple functional domains contributing to ligand binding and subsequent signaling events. Genetic substitution of each of the aa residues in the extracellular face of CXCR1 with alanine revealed that several residues in the N terminus and extracellular loops of CXCR1 are important for high affinity binding of IL-8 to CXCR1 and IL-8-mediated signal transduction (15Hebert C.A. Chuntharapai A. Smith M. Colby T. Kim J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hebert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with human/rabbit chimeric IL-8 receptors indicated that the N-terminal regions could confer the specificity selection for GROα and NAP-2 between the two receptor subtypes in a cross-species setting (17LaRosa G.J.

Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Vanden Bos T. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A more recent report suggested that regions other than the N terminus of the receptors might be important for the difference between human CXCR1 and CXCR2 ligand specificity (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the latter study, the authors also showed that IL-8, GROα, and NAP-2 could elicit Ca2+ signaling via a CXCR2 chimeric receptor with the entire N terminus being replaced with that of human CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), even though no obvious binding of IL-8 was detected. Although these studies provide some insight as to the structural requirements for IL-8 binding and signaling, they were not aimed to dissect these two processes.Blocking antibodies against chemokine receptors could provide valuable tools in studying the structure-function relationship of the receptor. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or polyclonal antibodies against IL-8 receptor have been developed and among them, some block the ligand binding of 125I-labeled IL-8 to transfectant cells (20Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Burnier J. Wood W.I. Hebert C. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1783-1789PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Hebert C.A. Kim K.J. J.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described the generation of mAbs against IL-8 receptors and the use of these mAbs to detect receptor expression on various cell populations (23Qin S. Larosa G. Campbell J.J. Heath H. Kassam N. Shi X. Zeng L. Butcher E.C. Mackay C.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further characterized these mAbs. The main finding from this work is that the IL-8 binding and signaling with its receptor appear to occur in discrete steps, potentially involving distinct determinants of receptor structure or conformation, as suggested by an anti-CXCR1 mAb that can effectively block IL-8-mediated functional responses without detectable effects on ligand binding.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we developed and characterized a panel of anti-CXCR1 and anti-CXCR2 mAbs. Interestingly, they all map to very small regions in the N terminus of the receptor, specifically, CXCR1 residues 10-15 (WDFDDL) for anti-CXCR1 mAbs and CXCR2 residues 6-10 (FEDFW) for anti-CXCR2 mAbs. Previous reports showed that specific mAbs against CXCR1 or CXCR2 could also be generated using transfected 293 cells expressing each receptor subtype (20Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Burnier J. Wood W.I. Hebert C. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1783-1789PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Hebert C.A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5682-5688PubMed Google Scholar). Although different cell transfectants were used as immunogens in those studies, these mAbs also mapped to the N-terminal regions of the receptor. Additionally, anti-CXCR1 or anti-CXCR2 antibodies were also generated by using receptor-specific peptides, and the epitopes of these antibodies were all mapped to N-terminal regions of residues 2-11 (20Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Burnier J. Wood W.I. Hebert C. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1783-1789PubMed Google Scholar) or 1-15 (22Hammond M.E.W. Lapointe G.R. Feucht P.H. Hilt S. Gallegos C.A. Gordon C.A. Giedlin M.A. Mullenbach G. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433PubMed Google Scholar). This may suggest that the N-terminal region of the receptor is more immunogenic than the other extracellular loops, or that the other extracellular loops are inaccessible to serve as immunogens. Furthermore, none of the mAbs generated by us or by others could recognize both CXCR1 and CXCR2. This is not surprising since the N terminus is the most divergent region between the two receptors.Most of the mAbs generated in this study are capable of effectively blocking IL-8 and/or GROα ligand binding as well as chemotaxis, elastase release, and VCAM-1 binding in CXCR1/CXCR2 transfectants and/or human neutrophils. Thus they provide valuable tools in studying receptor subtype-specific functions (30Jones S.A. Wolf M. Qin S. Mackay C.R. Baggiolini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the anti-CXCR1 mAbs generated by Chuntharapai et al. (20Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Burnier J. Wood W.I. Hebert C. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1783-1789PubMed Google Scholar) map to residues 2-14 for blocking antibodies and 2-11 for non-blocking antibodies, suggesting that the binding to residues 12-14 (FDD) might be important for blocking activity. In this report we have narrowed down the binding epitope of our anti-CXCR1 mAbs to residues 10-15, overlapping with those identified by Chuntharapai et al. (20Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Burnier J. Wood W.I. Hebert C. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1783-1789PubMed Google Scholar). All the anti-CXCR2 mAbs developed in this study were mapped to CXCR2 residues 6-10 (FEDFW). Furthermore, two others (10H2 and 4D1) generated by Chuntharapai et. al. (21Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Hebert C.A. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5682-5688PubMed Google Scholar), which were previously mapped to a region within residues 1-18, were also narrowed down to residues 6-10 in this study. These results suggest that although these residues may not necessarily be the direct binding sites for IL-8, they probably play important roles in ligand binding and other functionalities of the receptors.The most interesting finding from this study is revealed by a unique anti-CXCR1 mAb, 7D9. Although this mAb inhibited chemotaxis as effectively as other blocking mAbs, it could not inhibit IL-8 binding to CXCR1 transfectants. The inability of 7D9 to inhibit ligand binding does not seem to be caused by a lower affinity of this antibody since 7D9 and 5A12 had similar binding affinities as determined by using biotin-labeled mAbs on transfectant cells. The similar potencies of 7D9 and 5A12 in inhibiting chemotaxis also suggest that it is not due to their difference in affinity. Furthermore, the inhibition of chemotaxis by 7D9 and other mAbs did not result from receptor modulation from the cell surface during the assay (4-5-h incubation at 37°C) because these antibodies could also effectively inhibit transient responses mediated by CXCR1 and CXCR2, such as elastase release from neutrophils and VCAM-1 binding to transfectant cells.The N-terminal region of CXCR1 is an essential part of the epitope for 7D9 as 7D9 could recognize chimera 45A but not 49B, even though we could not completely rule out the possible involvement of other extracellular loops of the receptor since they are conserved between CXCR1 and CXCR2. However, based on the chimera staining and peptide competition results, 7D9 does not recognize the region seen by other anti-CXCR1 mAbs, i.e. the aa residues 10-15 (WDFDDL). The inclusion of a few additional residues after this sequence is not enough for its binding either, as peptide A10-19 could not effectively compete 7D9 binding. We noted that in Western blot analyses using these mAbs, 7D9 could not detect CXCR1, whereas 5A12 and other mAbs could. 2N. Ruffing and L. Wu, unpublished results. These combined data support the contention that 7D9 recognizes a conformational epitope predominantly within the N terminus of the receptor, in which residues residues 10-15 (WDFDDL) are not dominant.In this model, the binding of 7D9 still allows IL-8 to bind, but the antibody-receptor interaction constrains the receptor conformation. Thus the receptor cannot undergo any IL-8-induced conformational changes to elicit appropriate biological responses, such as chemotaxis and degranulation. Mutational studies on adrenergic receptors have suggested that secondary structures of the receptor are important for coupling to G-proteins (31Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). It is believed that the binding of an agonist to a G-protein-coupled receptor causes a conformational change in the receptor, leading to the formation of a high-affinity agonist receptor-G-protein complex, initiating the signal transduction cascade (for a review, see Ref. 34Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). Results obtained from this study using blocking mAb to the receptor support this model.Alternatively, it is possible that the binding of 7D9 to the receptor blocks the access of a signaling domain of IL-8 to the appropriate site of the receptor, therefore, leading to the failure to carry out signal transduction responses. Studies on the IL-8 structure-function relationship suggested that multiple domains of IL-8 are involved in binding and signaling (12Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hammond M.E.W. Shyamala V. Siani M.A. Gallegos C.A. Feucht P.H. Abbott J. Lapointe G.R. Moghadam M. Khoja H. Zakel J.

Kirtland S.J. Price G.J. Price L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9579-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the interaction domains between the inflammatory protein C5a and its receptor consist of two distinct subsites and the occupation of only one of the subsites is required for receptor activation (35Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Riper G.V. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).No matter which of the above two models is correct, they are all consistent with the notion that the binding and signaling of IL-8 with its receptor may occur in two discrete steps, mediated by distinct structural determinants. Although we have not completely mapped the determinant recognized by 7D9, its significance lies in the demonstration that these two processes are discrete. To our knowledge, this is the first report where a mAb against a chemokine receptor could block the signaling step but not the ligand binding. Thus it may provide a valuable tool for further dissecting of the two processes.The results on the ligand binding and chemotaxis with the CXCR1/2 chimeras generated in the present study provide useful information on the structure-function relationship of CXCR1 and CXCR2. The two reciprocal chimeras that switched the N-terminal region of the receptors, 45A and 49B, are identical to AB1 and BA1, respectively, as described in Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), except that the transfectants were made in different cell lines (L1-2 versus HEK 293 cells). We found that some of the properties of these chimeras are the same between the two studies, and others are different. Both studies demonstrated that 45A (AB1) shows high affinity ligand binding to IL-8, and this binding cannot be competed by cold GROα. Our data showed that it has a slightly higher affinity than wt CXCR1 and CXCR2. Furthermore, IL-8 can induce strong signal transduction responses as measured by chemotaxis (this study) or Ca2+ flux (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As to GROα responses, we could not detect any specific binding to GROα even when 125I-labeled GROα was used at a concentration as high as 5 nM, nor could we observe a chemotactic response to GROα unless a very high concentration of chemokine (100 nM) was used, which is similar to the response exhibited by CXCR1 transfectants. Somewhat differently, Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported a Ki value of 13 nM to GROα in ligand binding and an EC50 of 9.5 nM for Ca2+ flux for this chimera. Our results are more consistent with those of LaRosa et al. (17LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gayle et al. (18Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. Vanden Bos T. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where the rabbit CXCR1 was used in the chimera rather than the human CXCR1, and they all suggest that the N-terminal segment of CXCR1 is a dominant determinant of receptor subtype selectivity.For chimera 49B (BA1), neither we nor Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) could detect any specific ligand binding with 125I-labeled IL-8. Signal transduction responses of this chimera mediated by IL-8 or GROα were detectable at high concentrations of ligand (∼100 nM for chemotaxis and EC50 = 10 to 20 nM for Ca2+ flux response). The difference between the two studies for this chimera resides in the fact that Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was able to get a high affinity binding to GROα (Ki = 0.7 nM) although the total binding is very low (14%), whereas we have failed to detect any 125I-labeled GROα binding. The discrepancy in the GROα binding for both 45A and 49B between the two studies is not likely caused by the different level of receptor expression. For 45A, the average number of binding sites per cell was very similar (50,000-100,000 in this study and 100,000-200,000 by Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). For 49B, although it is difficult to compare the receptor levels in the two studies since Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) reported 40,000 binding sites per cell and we could not calculate it due to the lack of binding to either IL-8 or GROα, we speculate that in our study, it was expressed at a level similar to that of wt CXCR2 (50,000-100,000 sites/cell) since the two lines were stained by anti-CXCR2 mAb equally well. In the present study, the apparent discordance between chemotaxis and ligand binding imply that low percentage of receptor occupancy or high percentage occupancy at low affinity can still trigger a biological response. Moreover, since much higher concentrations of chemokines can be used in chemotaxis assays than in ligand binding assays, a weak or low affinity ligand binding-mediated response could be more easily detected in chemotaxis assays.The chimeras that have smaller segments of CXCR1 sequences, 15A, 10A, and 5A, all showed properties similar to CXCR2 in ligand binding and chemotaxis. Since the first 15 aa residues between CXCR1 and CXCR2 are very divergent, these results suggest that the determinant for binding specificity to GROα in CXCR2 is located distal to the first 15 aa residues. In conjunction with the data that chimera 49B does not bind GROα, these results support a model in which the GROα binding is critically determined by sequences in the N terminus, after the first 15 aa residues, as well as other parts of the receptor. This is consistent with the conclusion drawn by Ahuja et al. (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) that the determinant of GROα selectivity is located in both the N-terminal extracellular region and the TMD4 and E2 loop.In summary, this study further demonstrates the complexity of chemokine binding to and signaling through its receptors, and suggests that a conformational change of the receptor or the ligand secondary to IL-8 binding may play an important role in ligand binding and signaling. Future experiments using mutant IL-8 and additional mutant/chimeric receptors are needed to further define the binding domain of 7D9, to determine the nature of the receptor conformational changes, and to better understand the discrete binding and signaling steps. INTRODUCTIONChemokines (chemoattractant cytokines) play an important role in leukocyte trafficking to inflammatory sites. For example, interleukin-8 (IL-8) 1The abbreviations used are: IL-8Interleukin-8GROαgrowth-related oncogene αCXCR1CXC chemokine receptor 1 (IL-8RA)CXCR2CXC chemokine receptor 2 (IL-8RB)mAbmonoclonal antibodywtwild-typeaaamino acidFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pairs. is one of the most potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and is produced by many cell types in response to inflammatory stimuli. It induces angiogenesis, mediates cytokine-induced transendothelial neutrophil migration, and triggers a variety of other effects associated with the inflammatory response (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence indicating that in vivo IL-8 can initiate neutrophil infiltration to the site of inflammation, causing tissue injury. In animal models of acute inflammation such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acid induced lung injury, anti-IL-8 antibodies have produced beneficial effects in reducing inflammatory tissue damage and improving survival (2Sekido N. Mukaida N. Harada A. Nakanishi I. Watanabe Y. Matsushima K. Nature. 1993; 365: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 3Broaddus V.C. Boylan A.M. Hoeffel J.M. Kim K.J. Sadick M. Chuntharapai A. Hebert C.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2960-2967PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mulligan M.S. Jones M.L. Bolanowski M.A. Baganoff M.P. Deppeler C.L. Meyers D.M. Ryan U.S. Ward P.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5585-5595PubMed Google Scholar). All these data support the notion that if the IL-8 activities could be specifically controlled in humans, we may be able to prevent injuries caused by infiltrating neutrophils and other inflammatory cells. For such purposes, a better understanding of how IL-8 binds and signals with its receptors will certainly help us develop potent receptor antagonists.Two distinct types of IL-8 receptors, CXCR1 (formally IL-8RA) and CXCR2 (formally IL-8RB), have been cloned and sequenced (5Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 6Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). These two subtypes share about 74% amino acid identity. Their transmembrane regions and intracellular loops are extremely similar while the N- and C-terminal regions are very different. The IL-8 receptors, and other chemokine receptors, belong to a family of seven-transmembrane or “serpentine” receptors that interact with GTP-binding proteins to elicit various biological responses (7Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 8Damaj B.B. McColl S.R. Mahana W. Crouch M.F. Naccache P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12783-12789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These two IL-8 receptors display overlapping but distinct ligand specificities. CXCR1 binds IL-8 with high affinity, but not other chemokines, while CXCR2 binds with high affinity to other CXC chemokines such as GROα, NAP-2, as well as IL-8. The functional significance of such selectivity is not clear since on peripheral blood cells, where most of the IL-8 activities have been observed, these two receptors are expressed at similar levels on neutrophils and subsets of lymphocytes.The interaction between IL-8 and its receptors seems to be complex. A number of functional domains on the IL-8 molecule have been identified as essential for this interaction. Results obtained from mutagenesis and synthetic analogs of IL-8 demonstrated that residues Glu4−Leu5−Arg6 of IL-8 were necessary, but not sufficient, for high affinity binding and activities (9Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hebert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies identified a second region, comprising residues that cluster near a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket, that is important for IL-8 function (13Hammond M.E.W. Shyamala V. Siani M.A. Gallegos C.A. Feucht P.H. Abbott J. Lapointe G.R. Moghadam M. Khoja H. Zakel J. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Biol.

Price L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9579-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This region contains a second site for IL-8 receptor recognition that, in combination with the Glu4−Leu5−Arg6 region, can modulate receptor binding affinity and specificity.The IL-8 receptors may also provide multiple functional domains contributing to ligand binding and subsequent signaling events. Genetic substitution of each of the aa residues in the extracellular face of CXCR1 with alanine revealed that several residues in the N terminus and extracellular loops of CXCR1 are important for high affinity binding of IL-8 to CXCR1 and IL-8-mediated signal transduction (15Hebert C.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with human/rabbit chimeric IL-8 receptors indicated that the N-terminal regions could confer the specificity selection for GROα and NAP-2 between the two receptor subtypes in a cross-species setting (17LaRosa G.J.

A more recent report suggested that regions other than the N terminus of the receptors might be important for the difference between human CXCR1 and CXCR2 ligand specificity (19Ahuja S.K. Lee J.C. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 225-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the latter study, the authors also showed that IL-8, GROα, and NAP-2 could elicit Ca2+ signaling via a CXCR2 chimeric receptor with the entire N terminus being replaced with that of human CC chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), even though no obvious binding of IL-8 was detected. Although these studies provide some insight as to the structural requirements for IL-8 binding and signaling, they were not aimed to dissect these two processes.Blocking antibodies against chemokine receptors could provide valuable tools in studying the structure-function relationship of the receptor. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or polyclonal antibodies against IL-8 receptor have been developed and among them, some block the ligand binding of 125I-labeled IL-8 to transfectant cells (20Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Burnier J. Wood W.I. Hebert C. Kim K.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1783-1789PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chuntharapai A. Lee J. Hebert C.A. Kim K.J. J.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described the generation of mAbs against IL-8 receptors and the use of these mAbs to detect receptor expression on various cell populations (23Qin S. Larosa G. Campbell J.J. Heath H. Kassam N. Shi X. Zeng L. Butcher E.C. Mackay C.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further characterized these mAbs. The main finding from this work is that the IL-8 binding and signaling with its receptor appear to occur in discrete steps, potentially involving distinct determinants of receptor structure or conformation, as suggested by an anti-CXCR1 mAb that can effectively block IL-8-mediated functional responses without detectable effects on ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2031780396,"By means of the expression of two chimeric receptors, α2/m3 and m3/α2, in which the carboxyl-terminal receptor portions, containing transmembrane (TM) domains VI and VII, were exchanged between the α2C adrenergic and the m3 muscarinic receptor, Maggio et al. (Maggio, R., Vogel, Z., and Wess, J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 3103-31073) demonstrated that G protein-linked receptors are able to interact functionally with each other at the molecular level to form (hetero)dimers. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that interaction between receptors might depend on the presence of a long third intracellular (i3) loop and that shortening this loop could impair the capability of receptors to form dimers. To address this question, we initially created short chimeric α2 adrenergic/m3 muscarinic receptors in which 196 amino acids were deleted from the i3 loop (α2/m3-short and m3/α2-short). Although co-transfection of α2/m3 and m3/α2 resulted in the appearance of specific binding, the co-expression of the two short constructs (α2/m3-short and m3/α2-short), either together or in combination, respectively, with m3/α2 and α2/m3 did not result in any detectable binding activity. In another set of experiments, a mutant m3 receptor, m3/m2(16aa), containing 16 amino acids of the m2 receptor sequence at the amino terminus of the third cytoplasmic loop, which was capable of binding muscarinic ligands but was virtually unable to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, was also mutated in the i3 loop, resulting in the m3/m2(16aa)-short receptor. Although co-transfection of m3/m2(16aa) with a truncated form of the m3 receptor (m3-trunc, containing an in frame stop codon after amino acid codon 272 of the rat m3 sequence) resulted in a considerable carbachol-stimulated phosphatidylinositol breakdown, the co-transfection of m3/m2(16aa)-short with the truncated form of the m3 receptor did not result in any recovery of the functional activity. Thus, these data suggest that intermolecular interaction between muscarinic receptors, involving the exchange of amino-terminal (containing TM domains I-V) and carboxyl-terminal (containing TM domains VI and VII) receptor fragments depends on the presence of a long i3 loop. One may speculate that when alternative forms of receptors with a different length of the i3 loop exist, they could have a different propensity to dimerize.

INTRODUCTIONTransmembrane receptors recognize and integrate external signals modifying the metabolism or the ionic equilibrium of the cell milieu. Muscarinic receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled class of receptors (2Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have revealed the existence of five structurally related muscarinic receptor proteins (m1-m5; Refs. 3Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar and 4Bonner T.I. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The five muscarinic receptors are predicted to be composed of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM domains I-VII) 1The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembranei3third intracellularaaamino acidkbkilobasetrunctruncatedIP1inositol monophosphate. connected by alternating cytoplasmic and extracellular loops, an extracellular amino-terminal domain and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal segment. These receptors couple to a varied group of effectors, including membrane-associated phospholipases, adenylate and guanylate cyclases, and ion channels (5Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Neurobiology. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Google Scholar, 6Conklin B.R. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Ma A.L. Bonner T.I. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The third intracellular (i3) loop of these receptors confers specificity for G-protein coupling (9Wess J. Bonner T.I. Dörje F. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that this segment of the receptor is involved in the phenomenon of internalization and down-regulation (10Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J.

When truncated m2 or m3 receptors (containing TM domains I-V) were co-expressed in COS-7 cells with gene fragments coding for the corresponding carboxyl-terminal receptor portions (containing TM domains VI and VII), functional muscarinic receptors with ligand binding properties similar to the wild type receptors were obtained. These results have been confirmed and extended by Schöneberg et al. (14Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), who showed that muscarinic receptors consist not only of two but of multiple autonomous folding units.The association of amino-terminal (containing TM domains I-V) and carboxyl-terminal (containing TM domains VI and VII) receptor domains may occur not only intramolecularly but also intermolecularly, thus providing a molecular basis for receptor dimerization. This was demonstrated by creating two chimeric receptor molecules, α2/m3 and m3/α2, in which the carboxyl-terminal receptor domains (including TMDs VI and VII) were exchanged between the α2C adrenergic and the m3 muscarinic receptor (1Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Although transfection of the two chimeric constructs alone into COS-7 cells did not result in any detectable binding activity, co-expression of the two mutant receptors resulted in a significant number of specific binding sites for the muscarinic ligand N-[3H]methylscopolamine and the adrenergic ligand [3H]rauwolscine.Intuitively, the interaction between the two chimeric receptors is due to the exchange of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal receptor fragments held together by the i3 loop. The considerable extension of the i3 loop could free the amino- and carboxyl-terminal receptor domains, promoting intermolecular association. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by creating several constructs with a short i3 loop.DISCUSSIONDespite the commonly presented models of G-protein-coupled receptors that depict the protein as a closely packed structure, several reports indicate that G-protein-coupled receptors are in fact formed by multiple autonomous folding domains. In 1988 Kobilka et al. (19Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1988; 240: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) described that “split”β2 adrenergic receptors co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes bind adrenergic ligands. The same phenomenon was reported more recently by Maggio et al. (13Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) for the m3 muscarinic receptor. In subsequent experiments Schöneberg et al. (14Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) demonstrated that muscarinic receptors may consist not only of two but of multiple autonomous folding domains. Splitting the m3 muscarinic receptor in all the three intracellular and three extracellular loops, they demonstrated that some of these split receptors have the ability to maintain muscarinic binding and functional activity. Furthermore, they demonstrated that proper intracellular trafficking and plasma membrane insertion does not require the presence of the full-length receptor protein. In fact, even quite short polypeptides that contain only the first two or three TM domains are properly transported to the plasma membrane.In their report, Schöneberg et al. (14Schöneberg T. Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) showed that among the split receptors, only the receptor split in the i3 loop retained wild type affinity for all muscarinic ligands tested, suggesting that the i3 loop does not exert indirect conformational effects on the proper arrangement of the transmembrane receptor core (formed by TMs I-VII). The long extension of the i3 loop may explain why this segment of the protein does not restrain the rest of the receptor in any particular conformation. Moreover, this characteristic of the i3 loop is probably the basis that allows chimeric α2/m3 and m3/α2 receptors to exchange domains leading to (hetero)dimerization (1Maggio R. Vogel Z. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar).It is reasonable to think that shortening the i3 loop could impair the ability of receptors to interact. In agreement with this hypothesis, the data presented in this article show that chimeric α2 adrenergic/m3 muscarinic receptors with a large deletion in the i3 loop (α2/m3-short and m3/α2-short) are not able to interact anymore. For these short α2 adrenergic/m3 muscarinic receptor constructs we cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of intermolecular interaction could be due to an alteration in proper protein folding. However, this explanation seems to be unlikely, because other short constructs such as m3-short and m3/m2(16aa)-short (which have the same deletion in the i3 loop) do not display any alteration in their ability to fold and to be inserted into the plasma membrane. Rather, it seems that this deletion favors receptor expression in some way, as is suggested by the slightly but consistently higher number of binding sites observed for these two short constructs compared with the analogous receptors bearing the normal i3 loop (m3 wild type and m3/m2(16aa), respectively; Table II). Epitope-tagged receptors could have been constructed to address whether these two receptors are indeed present on the cell surface, but this experiment would not have excluded the possibility of misfolded protein not able to interact even when present on the membrane.In another set of experiments designed to overcome this problem, we used functionally impaired m3 muscarinic receptors. Like m3/m2(16aa), the short form of this receptor (m3/m2(16aa)-short) displays binding affinities similar to the wild type m3 receptor (besides a slight increase in agonist affinity). Nonetheless, the co-transfection of m3/m2(16aa)-short with m3-trunc was unable to restore phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis activity, indicating that the short i3 loop considerably limits the independence of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments of the m3/m2(16aa)-short receptor and, consequently, their ability to interact with foreign receptor domains.Our data lead to the conclusion that the length of the i3 loop plays a critical role in the regulation of receptor dimerization. Although muscarinic receptors physiologically do not have variants with a shorter i3 loop, dopamine receptors do. For example, an alternative splicing in the i3 loop of the dopamine D2 receptor leads to a short and a long form that differ in length by 29 amino acids (20Giros B. Sokoloff P. Martres M.-P. Riou J.-F. Emorine L.J. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1989; 342: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Even though in our experiments we deleted a very large portion of the protein (196 amino acids) to prevent receptor interaction, it is possible that smaller deletions could be equally effective, if the i3 loop is near a borderline length for intermolecular interaction between receptors.It has been demonstrated that the i3 loop of muscarinic receptors is involved in physiological activities like sequestration and down-regulation. For example, Lameh et al. (10Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J. Sadée W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13406-13412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a series of deletion mutants of the i3 loop of the m1 muscarinic receptor, demonstrated that these deletions left the phosphatidylinositol turnover activity unchanged but impaired the ability of the mutated receptors to internalize. Furthermore, they defined a narrow domain in the middle of the i3 loop (apparently maintained in all five muscarinic receptor subtypes), which is likely to be involved in receptor sequestration.Our experiments performed with the short form of the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor (m3-short) demonstrate that the large deletion of the i3 loop leaves the binding characteristics of the receptor, the phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis activity, and the ability of the receptor to internalize unvaried. These data indicate that the large portion of the i3 loop that has been deleted, at least in the rat m3 muscarinic receptor, is not essential for sequestration, but like the mutant receptor m3/m2(16aa)-short, it might prevent receptor dimerization. As the portion of the i3 loop removed contains several residues that are potential sites of phosphorylation (2Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), and evidence indicates that phosphorylation of the receptors at serine and threonine residues may be involved in the desensitization of G-protein-linked receptors (21Kobilka B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 22Richardson R.M. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22249-22255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be established whether this deletion of the i3 loop impairs receptor down-regulation, as has been reported by Shapiro and Nathanson (12Shapiro R.A. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8946-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for the human m1 muscarinic receptor.At the moment we do not know what the physiological role of receptor dimerization is, and only speculations are possible. For example, interaction between different receptor subtypes could lead to stimulation of different G proteins. We have demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of the m2 muscarinic receptor can efficiently interact with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the m3 receptor and form a hybrid m2/m3 receptor complex. Co-localization of m2 and m3 muscarinic receptor subtypes in the same cells could lead to the formation of an m2/m3 receptor heterodimer, which could stimulate other G proteins than the wild type m2 and m3 receptors. Alternatively, the intermolecular interaction might promote aggregation of receptors and a consequent compartmentalization of second messenger increase. In support of this view, a recent article by Wreggett and Wells (23Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) based on binding studies and gel electrophoresis experiments on solubilized receptors from porcine atria has clearly demonstrated a cooperativity interaction among muscarinic M2 receptors, and all of their data can be accounted for by cooperative effects within a receptor that is at least tetravalent. Further comparative studies between the wild type m3 muscarinic receptor and the mutant m3-short receptor could reveal the physiological role of the dimerization.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that removal of a large fragment of the i3 loop from the m3 muscarinic receptor does not modify its ability to bind ligands, to stimulate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, and to internalize; however, the same deletion alters the intermolecular interaction between receptors, showing that receptor dimerization depends on the length of the i3 loop. Based on the high structural homology found among all G-protein-coupled receptors, our findings should be of general importance for the entire class of integral membrane proteins. INTRODUCTIONTransmembrane receptors recognize and integrate external signals modifying the metabolism or the ionic equilibrium of the cell milieu. Muscarinic receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled class of receptors (2Hulme E.C. Birdsall N.J.M. Buckley N.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 633-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning studies have revealed the existence of five structurally related muscarinic receptor proteins (m1-m5; Refs. 3Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar and 4Bonner T.I. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The five muscarinic receptors are predicted to be composed of seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM domains I-VII) 1The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembranei3third intracellularaaamino acidkbkilobasetrunctruncatedIP1inositol monophosphate. connected by alternating cytoplasmic and extracellular loops, an extracellular amino-terminal domain and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal segment. These receptors couple to a varied group of effectors, including membrane-associated phospholipases, adenylate and guanylate cyclases, and ion channels (5Bernheim L. Mathie A. Hille B. Neurobiology. 1992; 89: 9544-9548Google Scholar, 6Conklin B.R. Brann M.R. Buckley N.J. Ma A.L. Bonner T.I. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The third intracellular (i3) loop of these receptors confers specificity for G-protein coupling (9Wess J. Bonner T.I. Dörje F. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that this segment of the receptor is involved in the phenomenon of internalization and down-regulation (10Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J.

PGE receptors are pharmacologically classified into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, and the diversity of PGE2 actions is ascribed to PGE receptor subtypes coupled to different signal transduction pathways. The existence of PGE receptor subtypes has been given substantial support by cloning of cDNAs encoding these four PGE receptor subtypes from various sources and their characterization as GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors (3Watabe A.

In rat uterus, ONO-NT-012 showed no contractile effect but inhibited the PGE2-induced contraction, implying that the predominant PGE receptor subtype involved in rat uterine contraction may be EP1 rather than EP3. In an initial approach to clarify the molecular mechanism of contractile action of PGE2 in the uterus, we tried to isolate PGE receptor cDNAs from a rat uterus cDNA library by a combination of cross-hybridization with mouse EP1 receptor cDNA as probe and blockade by ONO-NT-012 of [3H]PGE2 binding to cDNA-transfected cell membranes. In this report we describe the cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding rat EP1 (rEP1) receptor and its variant form from rat uterus. We also demonstrate that the rEP1-variant receptor protein translated from unspliced mRNA may interfere with the signal transduction of PGE receptors.

E2 is involved in a broad range of pathophysiological actions in diverse tissues through its binding to cell surface PGE receptor (1Coleman R.A. Kennedy I. Humphrey P.P.A. Bunce K. Lumley P.

PGE receptors are pharmacologically classified into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, and the diversity of PGE2 actions is ascribed to PGE receptor subtypes coupled to different signal transduction pathways. The existence of PGE receptor subtypes has been given substantial support by cloning of cDNAs encoding these four PGE receptor subtypes from various sources and their characterization as GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors (3Watabe A.

These isoforms, which are produced by alternative RNA splicing events and differ only in their COOH-terminal sequences, couple to different GTP-binding proteins to activate different second messenger systems.The pharmacological actions of these subtypes have been well characterized on the basis of their responses to various agonists and antagonists. It has been considered that the predominant PGE receptor subtype present in rat uterus is EP3 and that PGE2 exerts the contractile response in rat uterine smooth muscle via EP3 subtype with a minor contribution of EP1 (1Coleman R.A. Kennedy I. Humphrey P.P.A. Bunce K. Lumley P. Hansch C. Sammes P.G. Taylor J.B. Emmett J.C. Comprehensive Medical Chemistry. Vol. 3. Pergamon Press, Oxford1989: 643-714Google Scholar, 2Coleman R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2150776707,"In this study, we examined the mechanism of recently reported inactivation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) by insulin (Srinivasan, M., and Begum, N. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12514-12520) and its counter-regulation by cAMP agonists. Exposure of L6 myotubes to insulin resulted in a rapid inhibition of PP-2A that was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in the phosphotyrosine content of the immunoprecipitated PP-2A catalytic subunit. Pretreatment with (Sp)-cAMP, a cAMP agonist, completely blocked insulin-mediated inhibition of PP-2A activity and decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation of PP-2A catalytic subunit to control levels. To understand the mechanism of counter-regulation of PP-2A by (Sp)-cAMP, cells were pretreated with sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases. Vanadate prevented the effect of (Sp)-cAMP on PP-2A activity and increased the phosphorylation status of PP-2A catalytic subunit to the level observed with insulin. Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of 70-kDa S6 kinase activation, prevented insulin-mediated inactivation of PP-2A, suggesting that these pathways may participate in insulin-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of PP-2A. These results show that insulin signaling results in a rapid inactivation of PP-2A by increased tyrosine phosphorylation and cAMP agonists counter-regulate insulin's effect on PP-2A by decreasing phosphorylation, presumably via an activated phosphatase. In this study, we examined the mechanism of recently reported inactivation of protein phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) by insulin (Srinivasan, M., and Begum, N. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12514-12520) and its counter-regulation by cAMP agonists.

Two forms of PP-2A, PP-2A1 and PP-2A2, have been found in the cytosol of all tissues examined (4Mumby M. Walter G. Physiol.

The holoenzyme is a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit “C” with an apparent mass = 36 kDa, a 60-kDa regulatory subunit “A,” and one of several “B” subunits of ≈54, 55, 72, and 130 kDa (6Mayer-Jackel R.E. Ohkura H. Gomes R. Sunkel C.E. Baumgartner S. Hemmings B.A. Glover D.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 621-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ABC, AC, and C forms of PP-2A are known to have different substrate specificities based upon in vitro assays with artificial substrates (7Reudiger R. Van Wart Hood J.E. Mumby M. Walter G. Mol.

The physiologic importance of these forms and their regulation by hormones and extracellular stimuli has not been established. In vitro studies indicate that the catalytic subunit of PP-2A is regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation on tyrosine (9Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L.

Recent studies from this laboratory have shown that insulin acutely activates protein phosphatase-1 and concomitantly inhibits PP-2A activity in the rat skeletal muscle cell line, L6, in a differentiation-dependent manner (15Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results, in conjunction with our recent observation, that TNF-α-induced insulin resistance is accompanied by an elevation in PP-2A activity (16Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggested that rapid activation and inactivation of PP-1 and PP-2A, respectively, may be an integral part of the insulin-stimulated signal transduction pathway. Therefore, in this study, we have attempted to examine the mechanism of PP-2A inactivation by insulin and its counter-regulation by cAMP agonists. Furthermore, in order to gain insight into the upstream signaling components that may participate in insulin inactivation of PP-2A, the contributions of PI3-kinase and 70-kDa S6 kinase signaling pathways were evaluated with the use of specific inhibitors of these pathways. The results of this study suggest that insulin rapidly inactivates PP-2A in rat skeletal muscle cells by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit. cAMP agonists counter-regulate the insulin effect by decreasing phosphorylation of PP-2A, thereby resulting in enhanced PP-2A activity. Wortmannin and rapamycin prevent insulin's effect on PP-2A inactivation, suggesting that PI 3-kinase and/or 70-kDa S6 kinase generated signals may participate in insulin inactivation of PP-2A. Cell culture reagents, fetal bovine serum, phosphorylase kinase, and phosphorylase b were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity > 3000 Ci/mmol), [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and 125I-protein A, were purchased from DuPont NEN. (Sp)-cAMP, wortmannin, and rapamycin were purchased from Biomol Research (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Electrophoresis and protein assay reagents were from Bio-Rad. Okadaic acid was from Moana Bioproducts (Honolulu, Hawaii). Protease inhibitors, sodium orthovanadate, and all other reagents were from Sigma. Porcine insulin was a kind gift from Eli Lilly Co. Antibody to the catalytic subunit of PP-2A was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The spontaneously fusing rat skeletal muscle cell line, L6, was a kind gift from Dr. Amira Klip (The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). Cells were grown and maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C as described previously (15Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Completely differentiated myotubes were used for all the experiments after 16-18 h of starvation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Serum-starved myotubes were fed with serum-free medium containing 5 mM glucose and incubated at 37°C for 1 h before treatment with insulin or (Sp)-cAMP. Identical dishes in triplicate were treated with and without (Sp)-cAMP (10−4 M) for 0-60 min, followed by 10 nM insulin treatment for 5-10 min. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with freshly prepared orthovanadate (1 mM) for 20 min prior to (Sp)-cAMP or insulin exposure. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was removed and the cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of PP-2A extraction buffer. Control-, insulin-, and (Sp)-cAMP-treated cells were scraped off the dishes with 0.3 ml of phosphatase extraction buffer containing 20 mM imidazole-HCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.0, with 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PhMeSO2F. The cells were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were used for the assay of phosphatase activities. The assay was performed in the presence and absence of 2 nM okadaic acid to inhibit PP-2A activity. The conditions of the assay allow measurement of PP-1 and PP-2A activities and not PP-2B and PP-2C enzymes which require divalent ions. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that okadaic acid at 2 nM concentration inhibits only PP-2A, and the PP-1 activity remaining in the assay was comparable with the activity inhibited by inhibitor 2 (15Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP-2A activity was calculated by subtracting the activity measured in the presence of okadaic acid from the activity measured in the absence of okadaic acid. Purified [32P]phosphorylase a was used as a substrate (15Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled phosphorylase a was prepared by reacting [γ-32P]ATP with purified phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase b (18Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Control- and agonist-treated cells were lysed in lysis buffer deprived of phosphatase inhibitors. Cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of protein (50-100 μg) were then incubated 2-4 h at 4°C in the presence of 2 μg of anti-PP-2A C subunit antibody adsorbed overnight at 4°C to protein A-Sepharose (19Chajry N. Martin P.M. Cochet C. Berthois Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pellets were washed four times in lysis buffer. After an additional wash in kinase buffer, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer. The phosphatase assay was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 32P-labeled phosphorylase a. After 10 min at 30°C, the reaction was stopped with 40 μl of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer. In parallel, spontaneous dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled phosphorylase a was evaluated by incubating it in the absence of cell extract. Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then subjected to autoradiography. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation was tested by the addition of 2 nM okadaic acid, a concentration that specifically inhibits PP-2A activity. In all cases, the okadaic acid-resistant phosphatase activity did not exceed 10% of the activity measured in the absence of okadaic acid. After autoradiography, [32P]phosphorylase dephosphorylation was measured by quantitation of the substrate bands by image analysis. Phosphatase activity was determined as the difference between the initial [32P]phosphorylase level and the level remaining after the reaction. L6 cells were serum-starved overnight. Next day, the medium was removed and replaced by 1 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubation was continued for 1 h. [32P]Orthophosphate was added (0.5 mCi/ml), and the cells were incubated for 4 h followed by sodium orthovanadate (1 mM) or (Sp)-cAMP (10−4 M) for 20 min. Insulin (10 nM) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The cells were rinsed four times with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors and harvested in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 40 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, antipain, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and pepstatin A, 100 mM NaCl, 1 μM microcystin, and 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min to remove cell debris. 400 μg of cell lysate protein was diluted to 1 ml with lysis buffer and precleared by incubation with rat IgG (5 μg/ml, coupled to protein A-Sepharose) at 4°C for 1 h. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with PP-2A catalytic subunit antibody (4 μg/sample) for 8 h at 4°C, followed by treatment with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL6B (50% v/v) for 1 h. In some experiments, the antibody was preincubated with the competing peptide before adding to cell lysates. The pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, followed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 s) to pellet down the Sepharose beads. Electrophoresis of the immunoprecipitates was performed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by autoradiography (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). The protein and phosphotyrosine contents of PP-2A catalytic subunits were determined by immunoprecipitating unlabeled cell lysates with anti-PP-2A C subunit antibody, followed by separation of immunoprecipitated proteins on SDS-PAGE. After transferring proteins to PVDF membranes, the membranes were probed with PP-2A C subunit antibody or phosphotyrosine antibody followed by detection with 125I-protein A (0.2 μCi/ml) and autoradiography. The intensity of the signal was quantitated by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms as well as by the “cut and count” technique. The protein contents of the cell extracts were determined by the Bradford assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) or by using bicinchoninic acid (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18514) Google Scholar). Student's t test and analysis of variance were used to evaluate the significance of the effects of vanadate, (Sp)-cAMP, and insulin. As indicated previously (15Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acute exposure of L6 myotubes to physiologic concentrations of insulin for 5-10 min resulted in a rapid activation of PP-1 and an inhibition of PP-2A. In this study, we examined the mechanism of inactivation of PP-2A by insulin and the effect of cAMP analogues on insulin-mediated inhibition of PP-2A activity. The kinetics of PP-2A inhibition by insulin is shown in Fig. 1. Treatment of L6 cells with 10 nM insulin resulted in a 35% reduction in cytosolic PP-2A activity within 10 min when compared with untreated control cells. A maximal reduction of 43% was observed after 20 min of incubation, and the effect was sustained for the entire 60-min period studied. Insulin dose-response studies demonstrated an inhibition of PP-2A activity at all concentrations of insulin tested (Fig. 2). Maximal reduction in enzyme activity was observed at 20 nM insulin, and the effect was sustained up to 100 nM insulin tested.Fig. 2Dose-response of insulin-mediated inactivation of PP-2A. L6 cells were treated with insulin (0-100 nM) for 10 min. Cell extracts were assayed for PP-2A activity. Results are the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate whether PP-2A activity could be differentially regulated by insulin and the other counter-regulatory hormones, L6 cells were exposed to (Sp)-cAMP, a cAMP agonist, for 20 min prior to or after treatment with insulin. The presence of (Sp)-cAMP completely abolished the effect of insulin on PP-2A inhibition (Fig. 3). (Sp)-cAMP alone had very little effect on the basal PP-2A activity. Similar results were obtained with the other cAMP analogues, 8-bromo-cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP (data not shown). To examine whether (Sp)-cAMP blocked insulin inactivation of PP-2A by activating a phosphatase, thereby decreasing phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit, cells were preincubated for 20 min with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (an inhibitor of tyrosine and dual specific phosphatases) before exposure to (Sp)-cAMP and insulin. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of cells with sodium orthovanadate prevented the effect of (Sp)-cAMP on PP-2A activity. Direct addition of vanadate to cell extracts did not inhibit PP-2A activity. In contrast, treatment of intact cells with sodium vanadate alone decreased PP-2A when compared with control cells. To directly assess changes in PP-2A activity in response to insulin and (Sp)-cAMP, immunoprecipitation of PP-2A was performed with a peptide antibody directed against the C subunit of human PP-2A (19Chajry N. Martin P.M. Cochet C. Berthois Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated PP-2A activity was measured with [32P]phosphorylase a as a substrate. As indicated in Fig. 5, insulin caused 60% decrease in PP-2A activity when compared with control. The presence of (Sp)-cAMP during insulin exposure blocked insulin effect on PP-2A activity. Pretreatment with vanadate prevented (Sp)-cAMP effect on PP-2A. As indicated in Fig. 4, cells incubated with vanadate alone also showed an inhibition of PP-2A activity when compared with control cells. Addition of vanadate to immunoprecipitated PP-2A did not affect the enzyme activity. Insulin and (Sp)-cAMP treatment did not change the abundance of PP-2A catalytic subunit (Fig. 6). The results of Figs. 3, 4, 5 suggested that insulin and (Sp)-cAMP effects on PP-2A inactivation/reactivation may be mediated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. To examine this, we immunoprecipitated cell extracts with a peptide antibody raised against the catalytic subunit of PP-2A. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 7A). Insulin treatment resulted in a >3-fold increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PP-2A catalytic subunit when compared with control cells (compare Fig. 7A, lane 2 versus lane 1). The phosphotyrosine content of PP-2A in cells treated with (Sp)-cAMP alone (lane 3) was comparable with control cells. In contrast, cells treated with (Sp)-cAMP followed by insulin (lane 4) exhibited a reduction in the phosphotyrosine content of PP-2A. The observed alterations in PP-2A tyrosine phosphorylation seen in insulin- and (Sp)-cAMP-treated cells were not due to variations in the amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 7B). Next, we examined the phosphorylation status of PP-2A catalytic subunit in 32P-labeled cells that were exposed to insulin and (Sp)-cAMP. As shown in Fig. 8A, insulin treatment for 2, 5, 10, and 20 min (lanes 2, 5, 6, and 7) resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of the 36-kDa subunit of PP-2A when compared with control cells (lane 1). Cells exposed to (Sp)-cAMP for 20 min prior to (lane 3) or after 10 min of insulin treatment (lane 4) showed less phosphorylation of the PP-2A catalytic subunit when compared with insulin alone (lanes 5-7). Pretreatment with vanadate before (Sp)-cAMP (lane 9) prevented the (Sp)-cAMP effect on the phosphorylation status of the PP-2A catalytic subunit (compare lane 9 with lanes 3 and 4). Vanadate by itself (lane 8) caused a small increase in phosphorylation of PP-2A when compared with untreated control cells (lane 1). The extent of phosphorylation by (Sp)-cAMP alone was comparable with control cells (data not shown). Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates from an identical experiment in which cells were incubated with cold Pi revealed similar amounts of PP-2A catalytic subunit in each treatment (Fig. 8B). To gain insight into the upstream signaling components that might mediate insulin inactivation of PP-2A, we incubated cells with wortmaninn, a potent and selective inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and rapamycin, an immunosuppressant that selectively blocks the phosphorylation and activation of 70-kDa S6 kinase. Both inhibitors blocked insulin's effect on PP-2A inactivation and restored the enzyme activity to control levels (Table I). Wortmannin alone had very little effect on the basal activity of PP-2A, but completely prevented insulin-mediated inactivation of the enzyme. In contrast, rapamycin alone had a stimulatory effect on PP-2A, and it completely abolished insulin-induced inactivation of PP-2A.Table IWortmaninn and rapamycin prevent insulin-mediated inactivation of PP-2A activityTreatmentPP-2A activitynmol Pi released/mg protein/minNone (control)1.66 ± 0.162Insulin0.88 ± 0.100*Rapamycin1.99 ± 0.230Rapamycin + insulin1.87 ± 0.205**Wortmaninn1.48 ± 0.137Wortmaninn + insulin1.42 ± 0.130** Open table in a new tab This study suggests a possible mechanism for the previously reported inhibition of PP-2A activity by insulin in rat skeletal muscle cells. The insulin-mediated inactivation is accompanied by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the PP-2A catalytic subunit. (Sp)-cAMP, a cAMP agonist, abrogates insulin inactivation of PP-2A by decreasing phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit and restores PP-2A enzyme activity to control levels. These results provide new evidence that PP-2A activity is regulated in vivo by insulin and counter-regulatory hormones via a complex phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. Little is known about the in vivo regulation of PP-2A activity by hormones and growth factors. Studies by Chen et al. (9Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L.

Thus, the insulin receptor kinase, the epidermal growth factor receptor kinase, PP60v−src, and the insulin-stimulated protamine kinase have all been reported to catalyze tyrosine, threonine phosphorylation, and deactivation of purified PP-2A (9Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 12Guo H. Reddy S.A.G. Damuni Z. J. Biol.

An inactivation of PP-2A, as seen in the present study with insulin, may enhance the transmission of cellular signals through the kinase cascade. In contrast, the prevention of PP-2A inactivation by counter-regulatory hormones may block insulin signaling through the kinase cascade, due to dephosphorylation and inactivation of MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase activities. In this respect, it is interesting to note that several previous studies have demonstrated an inhibition of insulin and growth factor-activated MAP kinase signaling by cAMP in various cell types including the rat adipose tissue (23Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 24Cook S.J. McCormick F.

Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5524-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Petritsch C. Woscholski R. Edelmann H.M.L. Ballou L.S. J. Biol.

However, these studies did not address the role of phosphatases in cAMP-mediated inhibition of MAP kinase signaling. We have recently demonstrated an inhibition of insulin-activated MAP kinase signaling by TNF-α in L6 cells (16Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The inhibition was downstream of p21ras and Raf-1. This inhibitory effect of TNF-α on MAP kinase cascade was accompanied by elevations in PP-2A activity (16Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with low concentrations of okadaic acid (a PP-2A inhibitor) prevented TNF-α-induced inhibition of MAP kinase signaling and restored insulin's effect on MAP kinase activation (16Begum N. Ragolia L. Srinivasan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). (Sp)-cAMP also blocked insulin-mediated PP-1 activation (15Srinivasan M. Begum N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12514-12520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MAP kinase signaling in L6 cells. 2N. Begum and L. Ragolia, unpublished results. Therefore, PP-2A inactivation/reactivation may play an important role in insulin- and cAMP-mediated signal transduction. It should be noted, however, that PP-2A activity measurements were performed using the conventional substrate phosphorylase a. This may not be the ideal substrate for PP-2A in skeletal muscle cells. Future studies should be directed toward the identification of in vivo cellular protein substrates that undergo changes in phosphorylation level as a consequence of changes in PP-2A activity. The prevention of the (Sp)-cAMP effect on PP-2A activity with sodium orthovanadate suggests that the cAMP effect on PP-2A may be mediated either by self-autodephosphorylation of PP-2A as suggested by Chen et al. (9Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) or via the activation of a tyrosine phosphatase. In support of the latter observation, studies by Brautigan and Pinault (30Brautigan D.L. Pinault F.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 121-129Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) indicate that activators of cAMP-dependent protein kinase increase the activity of phosphotyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTPase-1B) in intact cells. Although we have not directly measured tyrosine phosphatase activities in insulin- and (Sp)-cAMP-treated L6 cells, results with sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine and dual specificity phosphatases, suggest that cAMP agonists and insulin may regulate PP-2A activity by altering tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme. Thus the effect of insulin on PP-2A phosphorylation may be due to inhibition of PTPases or due to an activation of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase or both. cAMP agonist may abrogate insulin's effect on PP-2A inactivation by activating a PTPase. An elevation of PTPase activity has been observed in insulin-resistant cells and in animal models of experimental diabetes (31Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E932-E940PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with transfected cell lines overexpressing different forms of PTPases (e.g. CD45, LAR) demonstrate decreased activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, Insulin receptor substrate-1, and PI 3-kinase, thereby confirming that PTPases play a key role in the modulation of insulin signaling (32Zhang W.R. Li P.M. Oswald M.A. Goldstein B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33Mayerowitch J. Backer J.M. Csermely P. Shoelson S.E. Kahn C.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10338-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further studies are warranted to clarify the exact role and mechanism of action of PTPases in insulin and cAMP signaling. Nonetheless, the results of this study add a new dimension to the well documented antagonism between cAMP and insulin-mediated kinase cascade. Treatment of intact cells with orthovanadate alone caused a 40% inhibition of PP-2A activity. In contrast, an in vitro addition of vanadate to the immunoprecipitated PP-2A did not alter PP-2A activity. Thus our data lend support to the hypothesis that orthovanadate may act on intact cells indirectly by inhibiting a protein phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of an inactivating phosphotyrosine residue of PP-2A (19Chajry N. Martin P.M. Cochet C. Berthois Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Orthovanadate did not further inhibit PP-2A activity when present together with insulin, suggesting that both vanadate and insulin may share a common mechanism(s). However, the effect of insulin on PP-2A phosphorylation appears to be more potent than vanadate, suggesting that vanadate may inhibit PP-2A activity by some other mechanism other than maximizing phosphorylation of PP-2A. Further studies are needed to clarify the exact role of vanadate in the in vivo regulation of PP-2A. In an attempt to identify the upstream signaling components that may participate in insulin-mediated inactivation of PP-2A, cells were treated with wortmaninn, a potent and selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, and rapamycin, an inhibitor of 70-kDa S6 kinase (34Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both agents prevented insulin-mediated PP-2A inactivation and restored PP-2A activity to control values. These results suggests that (i) the insulin receptor may not directly phosphorylate PP-2A, and (ii) wortmaninn-sensitive PI 3-kinase and/or S6 kinase pathway may be participating in insulin signaling leading to PP-2A inactivation. The present studies do not rule out the possibility that insulin inactivation of PP-2A may be mediated through the activation of the recently reported inhibitors of PP-2A. In summary, the results of the present study indicate that insulin signaling involves a rapid inactivation of PP-2A by increased tyrosine phosphorylation on its catalytic subunit, and counter-regulatory hormones block the insulin effect on PP-2A by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation."

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification of calcitonin receptor sequences from rabbit osteoclast RNA yielded cDNAs that encode two isoforms of the calcitonin receptor. One isoform is homologous to the C1a isoform previously identified in multiple cell types and species, while the second, designated CTRΔe13, is a previously unidentified isoform that is apparently generated by alternative splicing during mRNA processing that deletes exon 13, resulting in the absence of 14 amino acids in the predicted seventh transmembrane domain. Expression of mRNA transcripts encoding the two isoforms varies in a tissue-specific manner, with CTRΔe13 accounting for less than 15% of the total calcitonin receptor mRNA in osteoclasts, kidney, and brain, but comprising at least 50% of the transcripts in skeletal muscle and lung. The two isoforms were expressed, and the ligand binding and signal transduction properties were characterized. Deletion of the residues in the seventh transmembrane domain in CTRΔe13 reduced the binding affinity for salmon and human calcitonin by more than 10-fold and approximately 2-fold, respectively, resulting in a receptor that failed to discriminate between the two forms of calcitonin. Both isoforms activated adenylyl cyclase, with EC50 values consistent with the difference in ligand affinities. In contrast, only the C1a isoform, but not the CTRΔe13 isoform, activated phospholipase C. Thus, while the CTRΔe13 remains active despite the deletion of a significant portion of its seventh transmembrane domain, it has significantly altered ligand recognition and signal transduction properties.

Besides this hypocalcemic effect, CT modulates the renal transport of water and several ions other than calcium, and acts on the central nervous system to induce analgesia, anorexia, and gastric secretion (1Azria M. The Calcitonins: Physiology and Pharmacology. Karger, Basel1989Google Scholar). The CT receptor (CTR) belongs to a family of G protein-coupled peptide receptors that includes receptors for parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, growth hormone-releasing hormone, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptide, corticotropin-releasing factor, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (2Segre G.V.

The CTR, like other members of this family, is known to couple to multiple trimeric G proteins that activate several signaling molecules, thereby producing diverse biological responses in different cell types. For example, we and others have shown that some aspects of the osteoclast (OC) response to CT are mediated by the cAMP pathway, while others are mediated by protein kinase C (5Su Y. Chakraborty M.

The coupling of a recombinant CTR to both the adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C signaling pathways has been demonstrated (9Force T. Bonventre J.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S.R.

Cloning of the CTR gene and cDNAs has revealed the presence of several alternatively spliced cassettes, resulting in the expression of different isoforms of the receptor. Four isoforms have so far been identified. The most common isoform, C1a, was originally cloned from porcine kidney epithelial cells (11Lin H.Y. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A.

To better understand the molecular basis of the function of the CTR in OCs, we have investigated the expression of CTR isoforms in isolated rabbit OCs. In addition to the widely expressed C1a isoform, we found a novel isoform, CTRΔe13, that is generated by deletion of the cassette that corresponds to exon 13 of the porcine CTR gene (17Zolnierowicz S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19530-19538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and encodes 14 amino acids in the putative seventh transmembrane domain. The CTRΔe13 mRNA is present in all rabbit tissues that express the C1a isoform. Despite the deletion of more than half of the putative seventh transmembrane domain, which could have been expected to have a profound negative effect on the CTR expression or activity, characterization of the CTRΔe13 isoform demonstrated that the protein is a functional CTR, albeit with unique differences in ligand binding and signal transduction properties relative to those of C1a. Osteoclasts were isolated as described previously (24Tezuka K.-I. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Long bones were isolated from 1-week-old rabbits (body weight, 90-120 g). After removal of muscle and cartilage, the bones were minced in minimum essential medium-α modification (α-MEM) (Sigma) (pH = 6.9) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 26 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 10 mM HEPES. Cells were dissociated from bone fragments by gentle vortexing, then bone fragments were allowed to settle under normal gravity. The supernatant was removed and saved, and the mincing and sedimentation were repeated three more times. The supernatants were pooled and centrifuged for 5 min at 60 × g. The pelleted cells obtained from the bones of one rabbit were resuspended in 40 ml of α-MEM and plated into four 10-cm culture dishes. After 18 h of culture, the adherent cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA and 0.001% Pronase E (Sigma) for 10 min at 37°C to remove contaminating cells. The highly enriched osteoclasts (>90%) were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in α-MEM for 18 h prior to isolation of RNA. Standard molecular biology techniques were performed as described elsewhere (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston D.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on sequences that are highly conserved among CTR sequences from other species (11Lin H.Y. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A.

For RT-PCR, first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using a gene-specific primer at the C-terminal end of the coding region, and the CTR cDNA was amplified by PCR with various pairs of primers chosen to correspond to sense and antisense sequences in the N-terminal extracellular domain (nucleotides 458-484 of human C1a cDNA; 5′-TATTGCAACCGCACCTGGGATGGATGG-3′) (primer 1), the fifth transmembrane domain (primer 2, antisense complementary to nucleotides 1187-1213 of human C1a cDNA, 5′-CATGACAGGTCCATGGATGATGTAAAG-3′; primer 3, sense corresponding to nucleotides 1139-1165 of human C1a cDNA, 5′-GCAATCTACTTCAATGACAACTGCTGG-3′), and the C-terminal tail (antisense complementary to nucleotides 1616-1639 of human C1a cDNA; 5′-CCTCGGTTCCTGGTGGCAGATGTA-3′) (primer 4). The rabbit OC λEXlox cDNA library was screened by the plaque hybridization method with a 32P-labeled DNA fragment probe obtained by RT-PCR. Hybridization was performed at 42°C in 40% formamide and the filters were washed in 0.25 × SSC at 60°C. Isolated cDNAs were subcloned from the λEXlox phage vector into the EXlox plasmid vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) for sequencing. Double-stranded template sequencing was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sequenase kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The full-length of CTRΔe13 cDNA was generated by deletion of exon 13 from C1a cDNA using the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis PCR method. Epitope-tagged CTR were generated as described previously (26Canfield V.A. Levenson R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13782-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The hemagglutinin (HA) peptide (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced into the site between Thr30 and His31 after the deduced signal peptide cleavage site in the N-terminal coding region of CTR. The sequences of DNA constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene). For PCR amplification, first strand cDNA was generated as described above. The region of CTR exon 13 was amplified using a pair of sense (nucleotides 1381-1403 of rabbit C1a; 5′-GGAAGATCTATGGTTACCTCATG-3′) and antisense primers (nucleotides 1601-1622 of rabbit C1a; 5′-CTACCACCAGGAGCCCAGGAAC-3′). Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) with cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, 30 s at 72°C and a final extension for one cycle at 72°C for 1 min. The amplified PCR products were run on an 4% agarose gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide that complexed to sequence common to both isoforms (nucleotides 1486-1508 of rabbit C1a). RNase protection assay was performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (20 μg from OC and 100 μg from the other tissues) was mixed with the 32P-labeled (100,000 cpm) antisense RNA probe in 20 μl of hybridization buffer and incubated at 42°C overnight. The following morning, 200 μl of 1:100 diluted RNase solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 μl of RNase inactivation/precipitation mixture, and the RNA precipitated at −20°C for 30 min. Protected RNA fragments were separated on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) overnight. The COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 4500 mg/liter glucose, 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The HEK-293 cells were maintained in the same medium except that 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was used. Cells grown to 50% confluence in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 8 μg of plasmid DNA and 60 μg of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 5 ml of DMEM (27Fegner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4387) Google Scholar) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 6 h, after which 5 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum were added into transfection medium. Cells were cultured for an additional 18 h, at which time the transfection medium was replaced with regular culture medium. 24 h later, cells were replated into 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and cultured for an additional 48 h before assaying the receptor function. Stable transfectants were generated by culturing transfected HEK-293 cells with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones were isolated using cloning rings and were maintained in the presence of G418 (500 μg/ml). Both saturation and competition binding assays were performed as described previously (19Moore E.E. Kuestner R.E. Stroop S.D. Grant F.J. Matthewes S.L. Brady C.L. Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 959-968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with binding medium (DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated in this medium for 15 min at room temperature. In saturation binding assays, the medium was then removed and replaced with binding medium containing increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled calcitonin (Amersham Corp.) with or without 1000-fold excess of unlabeled calcitonin (Peninsula, Belmont, CA). In competition binding assays, 20,000-25,000 cpm/well of 125I-labeled human calcitonin (1 nM for C1a and 3 nM for CTRΔe13-transfected cells) were added to the wells in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands. The cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized with 0.5 N NaOH. The samples were collected from each well and counted in a gamma counter. cAMP was measured as described elsewhere (10Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Catanzariti L. Hemmings B.A. Bourne H.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 551-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of ligand in DMEM containing 10 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 95% ethanol containing 3 mM HCl. The cAMP was quantitated using a scintillation proximity assay (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Inositol phosphates were measured as described previously (10Chabre O. Conklin B.R. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Catanzariti L. Hemmings B.A. Bourne H.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 551-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h before assay, the culture medium was replaced by the medium containing 2 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Corp.) and 5% dialyzed serum. Labeled cells were rinsed at room temperature with the assay medium (DMEM containing 10 mM LiCl and 20 mM HEPES). After washing, the cells were incubated in assay medium containing various concentrations of salmon CT at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.75 ml of ice-cold 20 mM formic acid. Inositol phosphates were separated from myo-inositol by ion exchange chromatography using Dowex columns (Bio-Rad AG 1-X8, 100-200 mesh, formate form). Data are expressed as the percentage of the total recovered [3H]inositol that is found in the inositol phosphate (IP) fraction. Other laboratories have identified several isoforms of the CTR that differ in their ligand binding and signaling properties in a variety of tissues and cells from human, pig, rat, and mouse (11Lin H.Y.

An 0.8-kb fragment was amplified from total rabbit OC RNA by RT-PCR using primers 1 and 2, and used to screen a rabbit OC cDNA library. Four cDNA clones, approximately 3.5 kb in length, were obtained. All four clones contained the complete coding region for the C1a isoform, as well as 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (Fig. 1). The rabbit C1a CTR is 71% identical at the nucleic acid level and 79% identical at the amino acid level to the porcine C1a. The putative translation initiation site was assigned at position 276 based on its similarity to predicted porcine, human, and rodent CTR initiation sites. In addition, it has adenosine residues at the +4 and the −3 positions, consistent with the requirements for translation initiation (30Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain encoded by the sequence on the 3′ side of the assigned initiation site included a hydrophobic domain flanked by polar regions, consistent with the general outline of a signal peptide. The rabbit OC CTR displays the cardinal features of the CTR family, including a large N-terminal extracellular domain with six conserved cysteine residues and three N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) and the seven transmembrane domain topography shared by all G protein-coupled receptors. It also contains a motif in the third intracellular loop (R-X11-K-A-V-K343) postulated to be involved in coupling to Gsα (31Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Inagaki M. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. Cell. 1991; 67: 723-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and a potential protein kinase C phosphorylation site in the C-terminal tail (Thr401). In parallel with screening the cDNA library, RT-PCR was used to determine if alternatively spliced CTR mRNAs were present in rabbit OCs. The expression of CTR isoforms that contain the inserts in the first intracellular loop and the first extracellular loop was examined using primers 1 and 2 which amplified the region from near the N terminus to the fifth transmembrane domain (756 bp in the human C1a sequence). A single product was observed in this reaction and sequence analysis indicated that it corresponded to the C1a isoform. None of the other isoforms previously reported in pig, human, and rodent were observed. However, amplification of the regions from the fifth transmembrane domain to near the C terminus (primers 3 and 4) and from near the N terminus to near the C terminus (primers 1 and 4) each produced two fragments, one with the size predicted from the C1a cDNA sequence (501 and 1182 bp, respectively) and a second slightly shorter fragment. For both amplification reactions, restriction digestion of the two PCR products with NcoI and PstI restriction enzymes generated a fragment of 382 bp and a shorter fragment of 340 bp, indicating a deletion of a DNA sequence between the NcoI and PstI sites (data not shown). Sequence analysis of these two PCR products indicated that the deletion corresponded to the 42 bp that encode 14 amino acids (Gly384-Glu397) in the putative seventh transmembrane domain. This 42-bp cassette corresponds exactly to exon 13 of the porcine CTR gene (17Zolnierowicz S. Cron P. Solinas-Toldo S. Fries R. Lin H.Y. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19530-19538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this novel isoform of CTR, “CTRΔe13,” is generated by alternative splicing of exon 13. The tissue distribution of the C1a and CTRΔe13 transcripts was investigated by amplification of RNA from several tissues, using a pair of primers flanking the region of exon 13 that produce a 242-bp product for C1a and a 200-bp product for CTRΔe13. Fig. 2A shows that both the C1a and CTRΔe13 were expressed in OC, kidney, brain, cerebellum, heart, and muscle. Only the CTRΔe13 was weakly detectable in lung, and neither isoform was detectable in liver. The relative expression of C1a and CTRΔe13 was then quantified by RNase protection assay using a radiolabeled antisense RNA probe that spans the region of exon 13. The predicted 253-base protected fragment for C1a and the predicted 170-base protected fragment for CTRΔe13 were both detected in all tissues except liver, lung, and heart (Fig. 2B). The relative levels of the mRNAs for the two isoforms, i.e. CTRΔe13/C1a, were 0.14 ± 0.04, 0.12 ± 0.03, 0.09 ± 0.02, 0.10 ± 0.02, and 1.93 ± 0.14 in OC, kidney, brain, cerebellum, and muscle, respectively (n = 2). Only the CTRΔe13 transcript was detectable in lung, and neither transcript was detectable in liver and heart. These data are consistent with the results of targeted PCR, again demonstrating that the CTRΔe13 was expressed in various tissues of rabbit, and indicating that CTRΔe13 represented a much higher proportion of total CTR transcripts in lung and muscle than in the other tissues. The ligand binding properties of the two isoforms were determined using a transient expression system. COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA constructs that encoded C1a or CTRΔe13 receptors with and without N-terminal HA epitope tags were used for saturation binding assays with either 125I-labeled salmon or human CT as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Preliminary studies demonstrated that the presence of the N-terminal HA epitope tag had no effect on the binding characteristics of either isoform, and the epitope-tagged receptors were used for subsequent studies. Saturable binding of 125I-sCT (Fig. 3A) and 125I-hCT (Fig. 3B) was observed with both the C1a- and CTRΔe13-tr"
https://openalex.org/W1996461191,"The promoter of the wheat Em gene contains elements with a CACGTG core sequence (G-boxes), which are recognized by EmBP-1, a wheat basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein. G-boxes are required for Em expression in response to the phytohormone abscisic acid and for transactivation by the Viviparous-1 protein (VP1) using transient expression systems. In order to identify other factors that are part of the transcriptional complex that associates with G-boxes, we have screened a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA library with biotinylated EmBP-1. We have isolated osZIP-1a, a homolog of EmBP-1 and other plant G-box-binding factors. We show that EmBP-1 and osZIP-1a will preferentially heterodimerize in vitro. Overexpression of osZIP-1a in rice protoplasts can enhance expression from the Em promoter only in the presence of abscisic acid. Two other clones have been identified by screening with EmBP-1: osZIP-2a and osZIP-2b. These osZIP-2 factors represent a novel class of bZIP proteins with an unusual DNA-binding domain that does not recognize G-boxes. The osZIP-2 factors can heterodimerize with EmBP-1 and prevent it from binding to the Em promoter. Interestingly, osZIP-1a does not heterodimerize with the osZIP-2 factors and its DNA binding activity is unaffected by their presence. Thus, osZIP-2 factors may be involved in sequestering a particular group of G-box-binding factors into inactive heterodimers.

Thus, osZIP-2 factors may be involved in sequestering a particular group of G-box-binding factors into inactive heterodimers. Since they were first identified as a conserved sequence in several of the light-induced rbcS genes (1Giuliano G. Pichersky E. Malik V.S. Timko M.P. Scolnik P.A. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We are particularly interested in elucidating the role of these G-boxes in the regulation of the Em gene, which is expressed during the later stages of higher plant embryogenesis. Two major regulators of Em gene expression are the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) 1The abbreviations used are: ABAabscisic acidbZIPbasic/leucine zipperGBFG-box-binding factorGUSβ-glucuronidaseABREABA response elementCaMVcauliflower mosaic virusMBPmaltose-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseORFopen reading framebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)NBTnitro blue tetrazoliumBCIP5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.

Colwell G.W. Chakerian R.L. Quatrano R.S. DNA Sequence. 1991; 1: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), fused to a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, can be induced ∼25-fold by physiological levels of ABA (8Marcotte Jr., W.R. Bayley C.C. Quatrano R.S. Nature. 1988; 335: 454-457Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). With this expression assay, a 66-bp ABA response element (ABRE) has been identified that, when fused to a minimal cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S-promoter, conferred ABA inducibility to this normally non-responsive viral promoter (9Marcotte Jr., W.R. Russell S.H. Quatrano R.S. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The ABRE contains three putative regulatory elements based on conserved sequence motifs: Em1a, Em2a, and Em1b. The two Em1 sequences are very similar to the G-boxes identified as regulatory elements in a wide variety of inducible plant promoters. Mutations in either the Em1a or Em1b elements greatly reduce but do not eliminate ABA inducibility (10Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 11Vasil V. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Rosenkrans L. Cocciolone S. Vasil I.K. Quatrano R.S. McCarty D.R.

Furthermore, transactivation of the Em promoter and a synergistic interaction with ABA by the VP1 protein in maize protoplasts also requires these same G-boxes (11Vasil V. Marcotte Jr., W.R.

The ABRE has been used to isolate trans-acting proteins that recognize the Em promoter. A cDNA encoding the bZIP factor EmBP-1, a class of transcription factors that are characterized by a DNA-binding domain rich in basic amino acids adjacent to a leucine zipper dimerization domain, has been characterized (10Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Using methylation interference footprinting, it was demonstrated that EmBP-1 can specifically recognize the Em1a element in the ABRE. The resulting footprint is indistinguishable from the one obtained using wheat embryo nuclear extracts. A mutation in the ACGT core of the Em1a element, which abolished binding by EmBP-1, also caused a strong reduction in the ABA inducibility (10Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) and VP1 transactivation properties of the mutated promoter (11Vasil V. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Rosenkrans L. Cocciolone S. Vasil I.K. Quatrano R.S. McCarty D.R. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to EmBP-1, more than 40 bZIP proteins from plants recognize elements with an ACGT core (for a review, see Ref. 2Foster R. Izawa T. Chua N.-H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Most of these bZIP factors can be classified in three major groups based on their overall structure and DNA-binding specificity (12Izawa T. Foster R. Chua N.-H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Group 1 factors, which include EmBP-1, are also called G-box-binding factors (GBF) since they will bind preferentially to ACGT elements with two G-box half sites, i.e. CACGTG. Using a variety of techniques, the Arabidopsis GBF1 (13Schindler U. Terzaghi W. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the tobacco TAF1 (14Oeda K. Salinas J. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1793-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have been shown to act as transcriptional activators while overexpression of CPRF-1 in parsley protoplasts results in a 6-fold reduction in the light-induction of the chalcone synthase promoter (15Feldbrügge M. Sprenger M. Dinkelbach M. Yazaki K. Harter K. Weisshaar B. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1607-1621PubMed Google Scholar). The second group of plant bZIP factors is not as well defined and mostly consists of homologs of the maize Opaque-2 (16Schmidt R.J. Burr F.A. Aukerman M.J. Burr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and rice RITA-1 transcriptional activators (17Izawa T. Foster R. Nakajima M. Shimamoto K. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1277-1287PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the parsley CPRF-2 protein (18Armstrong G.A. Weisshaar B. Hahlbrock K. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The third group comprises the TGA factors, which will recognize elements with a TGACG core sequence including several ACGT elements (19Schindler U. Beckmann H. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The tobacco TGA1a is a transcriptional activator as determined both by in vitro transcription assays (20Yamazaki K.-I. Katagiri F. Imaseki H. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and by transactivation experiments in plant (21Neuhaus G. Neuhaus-Uri G. Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 827-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast cells (22Rüth J. Schweyen R.J. Hirt H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Finally, some plant bZIP factors, such as the Arabidopsis GBF4 (23Menkens A.E. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2522-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PosF21 (24Aeschbacher R.A. Schrott M. Potrykus I. Saul M.W. Plant J. 1991; 1: 303-316PubMed Google Scholar), the maize OBF2 (25Singh K. Dennis E.S. Ellis J.G. Llewellyn D.J. Tokuhisa J.G. Wahleithner J.A. Peacock W.J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 891-903PubMed Google Scholar) and the rice lip19 (26Aguan K. Sugawara K. Suzuki N. Kusano T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), do not seem to belong to any of these groups. The observation that many plant promoters have ACGT cores in elements responsive to different signals, and the fact that the bZIP proteins that recognize these similar elements are encoded by multigene families, suggest that combinatorial interactions between different bZIPs and other regulatory proteins are likely to be required for specificity of expression. Numerous examples exist where eukaryotic gene expression is regulated by the interaction of a transcription factor with either another factor from the same or different family, or with a specific regulatory protein such as a kinase, a DNA-binding inhibitor, a cytoplasmic anchor, etc. (see Ref. 27Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, New York1994Google Scholar). This may also be the case in plants, since gel exclusion studies suggest that the size of the G-box-binding complex is approximately 160 kDa (28DeLisle A.J. Ferl R.J. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 547-557PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GF-14, a plant homolog of the 14-3-3 family of mammalian brain proteins, is part of that complex (29Lu G. DeLisle A.J. deVetten N.C. Ferl R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All of these examples have prompted us to use a protein-protein interaction screen to isolate from an expression library, rice cDNAs whose products can interact with EmBP-1. As a result we have isolated the first rice gene encoding a Group 1 GBF, osZIP-1a, as well as two members of the osZIP-2 gene family representing a novel group of plant bZIP proteins. In this report, we also present evidence that, unlike EmBP-1, overexpression of osZIP-1a can transactivate the ABA induction of the Em promoter in rice protoplasts. Also, the osZIP-2 factors can prevent EmBP-1, but not osZIP-1a, from binding to the Em promoter in a gel shift assay. Thus, a possible role for the osZIP-2 factors is that they can selectively inactivate some members of the Group 1 bZIP family. Subcloning of the EmBP-1 cDNA in the expression vector pPR997 (New England Biolabs) has been described previously (30Nantel A. Medina J. Quatrano R.S. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 164-173Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To obtain a plasmid expressing the MBP-osZIP-1a fusion, we flanked the ZIP-1a gene with EcoRI and HindIII sites by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the pE4D2 cDNA clone with the primers ANo-7 (GCGGAATTCATGGGTAGCAGTGG) and ANo-8 (GCGAAGCTTACAGTTGCGCCTGC). The amplified product was then digested with EcoRI/HindIII and ligated in the same sites of pPR997 yielding pAN72. Since yields of MBP-osZIP-1a were extremely low, we resorted to the purification of the ZIP-1aΔ107 partial protein with the pAN64 plasmid obtained by ligating the NcoI/KpnI insert of pE4-1 in the blunted EcoRI site of pPR997. Expression and purification of the MBP fusion proteins were performed as described (30Nantel A. Medina J. Quatrano R.S. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 164-173Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Purified fusion proteins were biotinylated with a 5-fold molar excess of NHS-LC-Biotin as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Appropriate amounts of proteins were blotted to BA-S nitrocellulose with a Schleicher & Schuell slot blotter. The filter was then allowed to dry and probed with the appropriate biotinylated protein as described for the library screening (30Nantel A. Medina J. Quatrano R.S. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 164-173Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), except that development in NBT/BCIP was allowed to proceed overnight. Plasmids from various subclones were isolated with the QIAprep-spin plasmid kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on both strands using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or at the UNC-CH Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the Taq DyeDeoxy™ terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of sequence data was performed with GCG (31Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar) and DNA Strider software (32Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated from rice embryonic suspension cells as described (33Rogers S.O. Bendich A.J. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: A6:1-A6:10Google Scholar, 34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar). Blots were probed using the manufacturer's recommended protocols for Hybond-N filters (Amersham) with DNA labeled using the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). For high stringency hybridization, conditions for the last wash were 10 min at 67°C in 0.1 × SCC, 0.1% SDS. In vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (with or without [35S]methionine) were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). For production of EmBP-1, we used the pAN10 plasmid which was produced by ligation of the EcoRI/XbaI insert of pAN7 (30Nantel A. Medina J. Quatrano R.S. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 164-173Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) in the same sites of pBluescript KS− (Stratagene). The pE4-1 and pE3-1 clones were used for production of osZIP-1aΔ107 and osZIP-2a, respectively. For production of osZIP-2b, a small SacII fragment, containing an out-of-frame ATG, was removed from the pE3A4 cDNA to give pAN75. Finally, pAN77 was constructed by removing a BglII/XhoI fragment from the pAN75 insert, resulting in the production of the osZIP-2bΔLZ partial protein. The strategy for production of the ABRE probe has been described previously (10Guiltinan M.J. Marcotte Jr., W.R. Quatrano R.S. Science. 1990; 250: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The following DNA oligonucleotides, when used as probes or in the competitive binding assay, were annealed and filled-in with Klenow and deoxynucleotides. When the DNA was to be used as a probe, dCTP was replaced with a [32P]dCTP and unincorporated nucleotides were removed with NucTrap push columns (Stratagene). For the actual gel shift assay, 20 ng of MBP fusion proteins, or 2-4 μl of reticulocyte lysate, were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 ng of 32P-labeled DNA and 1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 20 μl of Binding Buffer IV (12 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 45 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 12% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. When necessary, unlabeled competitors were added at the same time as the probe. In order to favor dimer exchange in the heterodimerization experiments, the proteins were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the other components. Gel electrophoresis was performed as described (35Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), and the dried gel was exposed to x-ray film for 1-3 days. We followed a previously described protocol (36Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Science. 1991; 251: 1211-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), except that we used MBP fusion proteins and an amylose resin (New England Biolabs) instead of GST fusions and glutathioneSepharose. Two-hybrid analysis of the various bZIP factors was performed using protocols, plasmids, and yeast strains obtained from Dr. Roger Brent (37Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites were inserted around the bZIP domains of EmBP-1 (amino acids 257-362) and osZIP-1a (amino acids 292-390) by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The amplified products were then inserted in the same sites of the pEG202 and pJG4-5 vectors. Subcloning of the full-length osZIP-2b gene was accomplished by inserting the EcoRI/XhoI insert of the pE3A4 cDNA in pEG202 or pJG4-5. β-Galactosidase activity was measured by a permeabilized cell assay (38Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The pCR349.11S plasmid, in which the EmBP-1 gene is fused to the CaMV 35S-promoter, was constructed by inserting an XmnI/HincII fragment of pAN11 (30Nantel A. Medina J. Quatrano R.S. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 164-173Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) into SmaI site of pDH51 (39Pietrzak M. Shillito R.D. Hohn T. Potrykus I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 5857-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The osZIP-1a gene in pAN72 was isolated and reinserted in the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pBluescript KS− to give pAN73. The BamHI/SalI insert of pAN73 could then be inserted next to the 35S-promoter in the same sites of the pDH51 expression vector yielding pAN74. The reporter plasmids pBM207 (9Marcotte Jr., W.R. Russell S.H. Quatrano R.S. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and pACT-1D (40McElroy D. Zhang W. Cao J. Wu R. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) have been described previously. Polyethylene glycol-mediated transfection of rice protoplasts and assays for GUS activity were performed as described (8Marcotte Jr., W.R. Bayley C.C. Quatrano R.S. Nature. 1988; 335: 454-457Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar), except that we produced our plasmids in the methylase-deficient Escherichia coli strain GM2163 (41Torres J.T. Block A. Hahlbrock K. Somssich I.E. Plant J. 1993; 4: 587-592Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis of the results was performed with Microsoft Excel. EmBP-1 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and purified by affinity chromatography. The fusion protein (MBP-EmBP-1) was then biotinylated and used to screen a rice cDNA expression library (30Nantel A. Medina J. Quatrano R.S. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1995; 13: 164-173Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The sequence of two clones whose products interacted specifically with EmBP-1, pE3-1 and pE4-1, revealed that both were partial cDNAs encoding polypeptides with homology to transcription factors of the bZIP class. The gene encoded by pE4-1 was named osZIP-1a, while the one corresponding to pE3-1 was named osZIP-2a. Using the 5′ region of each cDNAs as hybridization probes, several clones with longer inserts were isolated from the rice cDNA library. The sequence of the longest osZIP-1a clone contained a 1755-bp cDNA with a 1173-bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a 41-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 1A). None of the three osZIP-1a cDNAs that were analyzed in detail had the same polyadenylation site, resulting in 3′-untranslated regions of 121, 316, or 350 bp. The 5′-untranslated region of osZIP-1a contains three small ORFs of 54, 24, and 9 bp. The presence of three in-frame stop codons upstream of a start codon in the proper sequence context for translational initiation (42Lutcke H.A. Chow K.C. Mickel F.S. Moss K.A. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) indicated that the entire coding sequence was present. The carboxyl-terminal half of the osZIP-1a polypeptide contained a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper dimerization domain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The bZIP domain of osZIP-1a was similar to the one described for EmBP-1 and other plant GBFs (Fig. 3). Outside of its bZIP domain, osZIP-1a shows 46% amino acid homology with the amino-terminal domains of the tomato GBF9 (48Meier I. Gruissem W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and 41% homology with the NH2 terminus of the wheat HBP-1a(17) and HBP-1a(c14) factors (43Mikami K. Sakamoto A. Iwabuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9974-9985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Tabata T. Nakayama T. Mikami K. Iwabuchi M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1459-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The amino acid region between 72 and 106 contained 40% proline residues, while the region between amino acids 180 and 195 was very acidic and composed almost exclusively of serine and glutamic acid residues. Similar elements in other transcription factors have been shown to act as transcriptional activators (13Schindler U. Terzaghi W. Beckmann H. Kadesch T. Cashmore A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1275-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 50Mermod N. ONeill E.A. Kelly T.J. Tjian R.

Interestingly, a domain between amino acids 130 and 137 fits the P-loop consensus sequence, (A/G)X4GK(S/T) (where X represents any amino acid), characteristic of ATP/GTP binding domains (52Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem.

In Fig. 1 (B and C), the sequence for both of the osZIP-2 genes are given. As was the case for osZIP-1a, the osZIP-2b gene has at least two polyadenylation sites resulting in 3′-untranslated regions of 221 or 445 bp. The largest osZIP-2b cDNA started with a 633-bp ORF encoding a 22.5-kDa protein. This cDNA may not be full-length, since the largest internal ORF started at the second ATG and this start codon was not in a favorable sequence context (42Lutcke H.A. Chow K.C. Mickel F.S. Moss K.A. Kern H.F. Scheele G.A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the main difference between the two osZIP-2 polypeptides is a large proline-rich region downstream of the osZIP-2a bZIP domain. At the nucleotide sequence level, the two osZIP-2 genes are 82% identical in the regions encoding a serine-rich box and the bZIP domains (results not shown). In addition, an alignment of the osZIP-2 bZIP domains along with representative members of all groups of plant bZIP factors has been presented in Fig. 3. In particular, an arginine residue in the putative DNA-binding domain, which appears to be conserved in almost all bZIP factors described to date (53Hurst H.C. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 123-168PubMed Google Scholar), was replaced by an isoleucine (circled in Fig. 3). The leucine zipper domains of osZIP-2a and osZIP-2b also have a few unusual features. In the third and fourth heptad repeats, the leucine residues are replaced by a methionine and valine residues respectively. From such an analysis, it was clear that the osZIP-2 DNA-binding domains and leucine repeats were unique, with none of the characteristic patterns of the other plant bZIP groups. Blots of rice genomic DNA were probed at high stringency with the osZIP-1a and osZIP-2b cDNAs. The osZIP-1a probe hybridized to one major band in each lane and a few minor bands (Fig. 4A). The osZIP-2b probe hybridized to 3-5 bands in all lanes even with high stringency washes (Fig. 4A). Preliminary experiments showed that, under these washing conditions, no cross-hybridization between the osZIP-1a and osZIP-2 cDNAs was observed. This result, and our isolation of two homologous genes, demonstrated that the osZIP-2 proteins were encoded by a multigene family that may show substantial homology at the DNA sequence level. To determine the expression pattern of the new bZIP factors, total RNA was isolated from rice suspension cells incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μM ABA. The osZIP-1a cDNA hybridized to a 1.8-kb transcript whose abundance was significantly reduced in the presence of ABA. The osZIP-2b probe hybridized to a major transcript of about 900 bases,"

The C-terminal eight amino acid residues of tTG were recently reported to associate with the recognition and stimulation of phospholipase C (20Hwang K.-C. Gray C.D. Sivasubramanian N. Im M.-J. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27058-27062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The purpose of this study was to perform C-terminal deletion analysis of the recombinant human tTG and determine the effect on GTP/ATP hydrolysis (nucleotide triphosphatase, NTPase) activity of human tTG. We report that C-terminal deletion causes a loss of TGase activity and a major increase in NTPase activity. All mutants retained the fibronectin binding property. The importance of the C terminus in regulating the NTPase function will be discussed.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe investigated the role of the C terminus in regulating the GTP/ATPase activity of human tTG by expressing and purifying C-terminal deletion mutants as GST fusion proteins. We initially constructed mutants ΔS538, ΔE447, and ΔP345 (Fig. 1A). The ΔS538 mutant is similar in size to a tTG homologue expressed in human erythroleukemia cells and was recently reported to have increased GTPase activity (26Fraij B.M. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The ΔE447 mutant lacks the putative calcium binding domain (amino acids 446-453). The ΔP345 was designed to remove additional charged residues that could play a role in GTP and ATP binding (16Takeuchi Y. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson Jr., M.K. Lee K.N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence alignment with the structural domains of factor XIII A chain (27Yee V.C. Pederson L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the truncation site Ser-538 was located in the barrel 1 region, and Glu-447 and Pro-345 were located in the catalytic core region (Fig. 1A). Since the GTP/ATP hydrolysis activity was increased by 34-fold in the ΔP345 mutant (Fig. 1, C and D, see below), additional C-terminal truncation mutants were constructed. The ΔC290, ΔV228, and ΔF185 mutants stopped at intron-exon boundaries for exon 5, 4, and 3, respectively. These truncation sites were located in the catalytic core region when aligned with factor XIII A chain (Fig. 1A). All mutants were expressed and purified as GST-fusion proteins and migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with their expected molecular weights (Fig. 1A). All mutants except ΔC290 were shown to be greater than 90% pure by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation. The ΔC290 was approximately 50% pure and consistently had an E. coli protein copurify with the mutant. In preliminary studies, we established that cleavage of the GST was not necessary to obtain reproducible TGase activity measurements, GTPase/ATPase hydrolysis, and fibronectin binding results. The results obtained with the GST fusion protein were comparable with those obtained from cleaving the GST and purifying the tTG. Therefore, the affinity-purified fusion proteins were used directly in all investigations to facilitate the rapid purification of the mutants by the same method.We found there was a substantial decrease in the calcium-dependent TGase activity when the 149 amino acid residues were deleted from the C terminus (Fig. 1B). From 1 to 5% of the original TGase activity was detected for the ΔS538 and ΔE447 mutants. The ΔP345, ΔC290, ΔV228, and ΔF185 mutants had no detectable TGase activity even when assayed at 50-fold higher protein concentration. When the calcium chloride concentration was increased to 100 mM, there was no further increase in the TGase activity for the inactive tTG mutants. All of the truncation mutants displayed specific binding to the fibronectin-coated plate, demonstrating that the N terminus was exposed and could bind to fibronectin.We found that 1 mM MgCl2 was the optimal concentration required for hydrolysis of both GTP and ATP for all the C-terminal truncation mutants, and we used this concentration to characterize all the mutants. The apparent Km value for GTP varied from 110 to 181.9 μM and from 30.9 to 43 μM for ATP. These relatively minor changes demonstrate all mutants retained comparable affinity for ATP and GTP. In contrast, the Kcat for GTP was increased by 4.6- and 3-fold for the ΔS538 and ΔE447 mutants (Fig. 1C). There was a 34-fold increase in hydrolysis for the ΔP345 mutant and a subsequent reduction in activity to only an 8.1-, 8.7-, and 1.9-fold increase in hydrolysis for the ΔC290, ΔV228, and ΔF185 mutants, respectively (Fig. 1C). The change in Kcat for ATP increased in parallel with the GTP results, and the highest Kcat was detected for the ΔP345 mutant (Fig. 1D). The removal of the C terminus apparently allows the GTP/ATPase catalytic domain to fold in a manner that increases NTP hydrolysis activity. These data are consistent with published data demonstrating that an N-terminal 36-kDa fragment purified from rabbit liver retained GTP binding properties (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and that a human tTG homologue found in erythroleukemia cells had higher GTP hydrolysis activity (26Fraij B.M. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These data localize a GTP/ATPase hydrolytic domain to the N-terminal 185 amino acids of tTG with a predicted Mr of 20,825. It is possible that selective proteolysis of the C terminus of tTG could occur at some intracellular or extracellular compartment to produce a N-terminal fragment with increased NTPase activity. In preliminary studies, we have been able to detect an increase in the GTP/ATP hydrolysis activity of tTG by treating it with several different proteases. This finding demonstrated that the activity obtained with our deletion mutants was not an artifact of expressing C-terminal deletion mutants. 2T.-S. Lai and C. S. Greenberg, unpublished findings. Further studies are in progress to test the hypothesis that proteases activate the GTP/ATPase activity.To investigate whether protein folding is required for GTP/ATPase activity, we selected full-length tTG and ΔP345 mutant for this experiment. Since the conditions for protein renaturation vary between different proteins, we adapted the conditions that have been established for a homologous protein, plasma transglutaminase (i.e. coagulation factor XIII A chains) (25Rinas U. Risse B. Jaenicke R. Abel K.J. Zettlmeissl G. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that 90-95% of the protein remained soluble after renaturation. However, only 8-13% and 15% of the original GTPase activity was detected for the full-length tTG and ΔP345 mutant, respectively. There was no detectable TGase activity after renaturation of either the full-length tTG or the ΔP345 mutant. These results indicate that proper protein folding is required for displaying the GTP/ATPase and TGase activities. Furthermore, TGase activity is more sensitive to denaturation than the hydrolysis activity of the tTG.Although other investigators reported that tTG had ATPase activity (28Takeuchi Y. Birckbichler P.J. Patterson M.K. Lee K.N. Carter H.A. Z. Naturforsch. 1994; 49: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), none of the earlier investigations determined the nature of the reaction products generated by incubating ATP with tTG. The reaction products of ATP hydrolysis for both full-length tTG and the ΔP345 mutant were studied by TLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” Degradation of ATP occurred in two consecutive steps; there was very rapid formation of ADP followed by a much slower conversion of ADP to AMP. More than 50% of the ATP was converted to ADP during the first 10 min, and 85% was converted to ADP after 30 min of incubation. There was a substantial lag phase for the formation of AMP during the first 40 min of incubation, and less than 5% of the ADP was converted to AMP after 60 min of incubation (results not shown). Control experiments performed with either no enzyme or only the GST protein did not produce any ADP or AMP. These results indicate that the ΔP345 mutant hydrolyzes ATP to ADP at a much faster rate than the conversion of ADP to AMP. We found a similar pattern of hydrolysis for wild type tTG with more than 90% of the ATP converted to ADP, and <5% of ADP converted to AMP after 60 min of incubation. The inability of tTG to convert ADP to AMP suggests that the ADP could play a role in modulating the intracellular activity of the enzyme. We recently found that ADP can bind and inhibit the ATPase activity of the tTG.2. Therefore, once ADP is formed it would prevent ATP hydrolysis. In addition, ATP-tTG is inactive while ADP-tTG retains calcium-dependent TGase function.2The majority of tTG is found in the cytoplasm of the cell while 4-20% is associated with the particulate fraction (29Korner G. Schneider D.E. Purdon M.A. Bjornsson T.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recent finding that the full-length and the 36-kDa cleaved form of tTG associates with the nuclear pore of rat liver nuclei suggests that the tTG could play a role in modifying the structure of the nuclear pore or in trafficking of molecules through the pore (17Singh U.S. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15863-15871Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Specific processing by proteases in the nuclei could regulate the TGase and NTPase activity in this cellular compartment and warrants further analysis.The ECM surrounding endothelial cells and fibroblasts contain tTG (1Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P. Rice R.H. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and are exposed to ATP and other NTPs at sites of cell and tissue injury. The tTG could play a role in converting ATP to ADP and altering the response of cells to these vasoactive molecules (30Chen Z.-P. Levy A. Lightman S. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The tTG in the ECM could be cleaved at the C terminus by a protease released in response to tissue injury, and the cleaved form of tTG could modify local nucleotide concentrations. Cleaved forms of tTG were detected in human atherosclerotic aortic tissues and human breast cancer tumor tissue.2 If the proteolysis of tTG leaves the N terminus intact, fragments would remain bound to ECM and be localized to stimulate platelet activation by converting ATP to ADP. In preliminary studies, we have confirmed these findings by stimulating platelet aggregation by incubating platelet-rich plasma with a solution of ATP previously incubated with proteases and recombinant tTG.2 Since ATP and ADP are potent bioactive molecules in vascular tissues where tTG is expressed at high levels, the regulation of latent NTPase activity could be an important function for this ECM protein.Recently, the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.2 (Pallidin) was shown to bind ATP but not GTP, and the ATP binding consensus sequence was located at amino acids 340-352 (31Azim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Korsgren C. Dotimas E. Cohen C.M. Chishti A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3001-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which corresponds to amino acids 321-329 of human tTG. An ATP binding consensus sequence does not exist in tTG or any of the other published TG sequence. Since the ΔC290, ΔV228, and ΔF185 mutants retained significant GTP/ATP hydrolysis, amino acids 321-329 are not essential for hydrolysis, and the GTP/ATP binding capacity must reside in the first 185 amino acid residues.The C terminus also plays an important role in regulating the TGase activity since the activity of ΔS538 and ΔE447 mutants were decreased to 1-5% of the original value. The residual TGase activity displayed by the ΔE447 mutant suggests that additional calcium binding site(s) could substitute for the putative calcium binding domain located between amino acid residues 446 and 453. In addition, Ikura et al. (32Ikura K. Yu C. Nagao M. Sasaki R. Furuyoshi S. Kawabata N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also reported that the anionic amino acid residues (Glu-445 to Glu-452) in this domain were not essential for guinea pig liver TG to display calcium-dependent TGase activity. Further work is needed to localize the calcium binding site(s) in tTG.In conclusion, we have localized the ATP and GTP hydrolytic domain to amino acid residues 1-185 in the N terminus of tTG. The predicted structure of this fragment contains β-sandwich domain and part of the catalytic core region when it aligns with the structural domains of factor XIII A chain (27Yee V.C. Pederson L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The C terminus of tTG functions to inhibit the expression of this endogenous GTP/ATPase activity in the intact protein. Studies are in progress to define the role of the NTPase activity of tTG in healthy and injured tissues and define the importance of this reaction in regulating the cell cycle and cell receptor signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2012424310,"Fatty acid-binding protein from rat liver (L-FABP) binds 2 fatty acids (FA) per protein, in contrast to FABPs from adipocyte, heart, and intestine, for which binding and structural studies are consistent with a single FA binding site. To understand better the unique characteristics of L-FABP, we have carried out equilibrium binding and kinetic measurements of long chain FA using the fluorescent probes of free fatty acids (FFA), ADIFAB and ADIFAB2, to monitor the concentration of FFA in the reaction of FA with L-FABP. We found that the dissociation constants (Kd) ranged from about 1 nM to 4 μM, being largest for myristate at 45°C and smallest for oleate at 10°C, and that 2 FA were bound per L-FABP for all temperatures and FA. The binding measurements also revealed that at temperatures below 37°C, affinities for the two binding sites differ by between 5- and 20-fold but as the temperature was increased, the affinities converge toward equal values. Off-rate constants (koff) were similar for all FA and for temperatures between 10 and 45°C, ranged from about 0.1 s−1 to 50 s−1. Moreover, for all FA, koff values for dissociation from both the high and low affinity sites were similar, indicating that binding affinity differences at the lower temperatures reflect lower on-rates for binding to the low affinity site. The temperature at which the affinities of the two sites become equivalent depends upon the FA; higher temperatures (45-50°C) are required for the unsaturated FA and myristate than for the longer chain saturated FA (<37°C). This transition from different to equivalent affinity binding sites at specific temperatures reflects a nonlinear van't Hoff behavior of the high affinity site, which in turn is a reflection of large heat capacity changes (between −0.6 and −1.2 kcal K−1 mol−1) that accompany FA binding to the high affinity site. These heat capacity changes, which are unique to L-FABP, do not appear to be correlated with a significant conformational change upon ligand binding. The differences between long chain saturated and unsaturated FA suggest that the conformation of FA bound to L-FABP may differ with both FA type and temperature, and that, in comparison to other FABPs, L-FABP may have distinctly different effects on saturated and unsaturated FA metabolism. Fatty acid-binding protein from rat liver (L-FABP) binds 2 fatty acids (FA) per protein, in contrast to FABPs from adipocyte, heart, and intestine, for which binding and structural studies are consistent with a single FA binding site. To understand better the unique characteristics of L-FABP, we have carried out equilibrium binding and kinetic measurements of long chain FA using the fluorescent probes of free fatty acids (FFA), ADIFAB and ADIFAB2, to monitor the concentration of FFA in the reaction of FA with L-FABP. We found that the dissociation constants (Kd) ranged from about 1 nM to 4 μM, being largest for myristate at 45°C and smallest for oleate at 10°C, and that 2 FA were bound per L-FABP for all temperatures and FA. The binding measurements also revealed that at temperatures below 37°C, affinities for the two binding sites differ by between 5- and 20-fold but as the temperature was increased, the affinities converge toward equal values. Off-rate constants (koff) were similar for all FA and for temperatures between 10 and 45°C, ranged from about 0.1 s−1 to 50 s−1. Moreover, for all FA, koff values for dissociation from both the high and low affinity sites were similar, indicating that binding affinity differences at the lower temperatures reflect lower on-rates for binding to the low affinity site. The temperature at which the affinities of the two sites become equivalent depends upon the FA; higher temperatures (45-50°C) are required for the unsaturated FA and myristate than for the longer chain saturated FA (<37°C). This transition from different to equivalent affinity binding sites at specific temperatures reflects a nonlinear van't Hoff behavior of the high affinity site, which in turn is a reflection of large heat capacity changes (between −0.6 and −1.2 kcal K−1 mol−1) that accompany FA binding to the high affinity site.

Five of these precursor proteins are destined to different subchloroplast sites, and one is a leucoplast stromal precursor protein. The results indicate that some of these precursors can be imported equally into both plastid types and others preferentially into one type of plastid versus the other. The ability of plastids to import different proteins correlates with the in vivo steady state levels of these proteins. Additional differences were also observed in the intraorganellar portion of the translocation pathway for two thylakoidal proteins. The differences in import characteristics were found to be predominantly governed by information in the transit peptides, since attachment of the various transit peptides to different plastid and foreign proteins demonstrated that the import behavior of the proteins is transferable with the transit sequence. These results indicate that the import mechanisms of leucoplasts and chloroplasts are sufficiently different such that the plastids respond differently to the information present in the transit peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2029774258,"An RNA ligase previously detected in extracts of Escherichia coli is capable of joining Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA splicing intermediates in the absence of ATP to form a 2′-5′ phosphodiester linkage (Greer, C., Javor, B., and Abelson, J. (1983) Cell 33, 899-906). This enzyme specifically ligates tRNA half-molecules containing nucleoside base modifications and shows a preference among different tRNA species. In order to investigate the function of this enzyme in RNA metabolism, the ligase was purified to homogeneity from E. coli lysate utilizing chromatographic techniques and separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A single polypeptide of approximately 20 kilodaltons exhibited RNA ligase activity. The amino terminus of this protein was sequenced, and the open reading frame (ORF) encoding it was identified by a data base search. This ORF, which encodes a novel protein with a predicted molecular mass of 19.9 kDa, was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA and cloned. ORFs coding for highly similar proteins were detected in Methanococcus jannaschii and Bacillus stearothermophilus. The chromosomal gene encoding RNA ligase in E. coli was disrupted, abolishing ligase activity in cell lysates. Cells lacking ligase activity grew normally under laboratory conditions. However, moderate overexpression of the ligase protein led to slower growth rates and a temperature-sensitive phenotype in both wild-type and RNA ligase knockout strains. The RNA ligase reaction was studied in vitro using purified enzyme and was found to be reversible, indicating that this enzyme may perform cleavage or ligation in vivo. An RNA ligase previously detected in extracts of Escherichia coli is capable of joining Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA splicing intermediates in the absence of ATP to form a 2′-5′ phosphodiester linkage (Greer, C., Javor, B., and Abelson, J.

The RNA ligase reaction was studied in vitro using purified enzyme and was found to be reversible, indicating that this enzyme may perform cleavage or ligation in vivo. RNA ligases have been detected in organisms throughout all major divisions of the phylogenetic spectrum. Specific metabolic functions, however, have been assigned to few of these enzymes. T4 RNA ligase, for example, repairs nicks introduced into the anticodon loops of tRNAs in phage-restrictive Escherichia coli strains upon T4 infection (1Amitsur M. Levitz L. Kaufmann G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2499-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); the eukaryotic tRNA splicing RNA ligase joins tRNA half-molecules resulting from endonucleolytic removal of introns from eukaryotic tRNA precursors (2Peebles C.

Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At least two other species of RNA ligase, the metazoan-specific “animal pathway” RNA ligase (6Filipowicz W. Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1983; 32: 547-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the archaeal stable RNA splicing ligase (7Kjems J. Jensen J. Olesen T. Garrett R.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), have been identified, but the precise in vivo substrate(s) and function(s) of these enzymes have yet to be determined. The existence of RNA ligase in bacteria in the absence of bacteriophage infection was discovered in this laboratory in 1983 (8Greer C. Javor B Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 33: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An activity capable of performing the ligation step of eukaryotic tRNA splicing was detected in extracts of a wide range of bacteria including members of the Alpha and Gamma subdivisions of proteobacteria, green sulfur bacteria, and low G + C content Gram-positive bacteria (8Greer C. Javor B Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 33: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In extracts of E. coli the ligase activity had a substrate specificity restricted to 4 of the 10 Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA splicing intermediates: tRNA Tyr, Phe, Lys2, and Trp half-molecules. The reaction mechanism of the E. coli RNA ligase apparently differed from that of known RNA ligases since it did not require a nucleoside triphosphate cofactor, and the product contained an unusual 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond at the ligated junction (8Greer C. Javor B Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 33: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The discovery of RNA ligase in E. coli implies the existence of a novel form of bacterial RNA processing. No intervening sequences of the type found in eukaryotic nuclear or archaeal tRNA genes (which require enzymatic excision and religation) occur in known bacterial tRNA genes, although self-splicing introns are found in the tRNA genes of certain cyanobacteria (9Biniszkiewicz D. Cesnaviciene E. Shub D.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4629-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and some proteobacteria (10Reinholdhurek B. Shub D.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In fact, no introns of any kind are found in the full genomic complement of tRNA genes in E. coli, Mycoplasma capricolum, and Hemophilus influenzae (11Komine Y. Adachi T. Inokuchi H. Ozeki H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 579-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Andachi Y. Yamao F. Muto A. Osawa S. J. Mol.

Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4673) Google Scholar). To date no RNA processing event that would require the action of an RNA ligase enzyme has been observed to occur in any bacteria, indicating that elucidation of the substrate and function of the 2′-5′ RNA ligase should reveal a previously unknown step in bacterial RNA metabolism. A genuine in vivo function for the E. coli RNA ligase activity observed in vitro is suggested by the occurrence of 2′-5′ linkages in native E. coli RNA. Several forms of 2′-5′-linked oligoadenylates have been detected in acid-soluble extracts of E. coli (14Trujillo M. Roux D. Fueri J.P. Cailla H.L. Rickenberg H.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The most abundant species of these oligoribonucleotides observed was 2′-5′-linked adenosine dinucleotide 3′-monophosphate, which was estimated to exist at an intracellular concentration over 100 nM. This dinucleotide could not be an intermediate in oligoadenylate synthesis, and it has been suggested that this species may be a degradation product of RNAs containing individual 2′-5′ bonds among standard 3′-5′ linkages (14Trujillo M. Roux D. Fueri J.P. Cailla H.L. Rickenberg H.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since the formation of 2′-5′ linkages is not catalyzed by RNA polymerase, these bonds must be added in a post-transcriptional processing event by an enzyme such as the 2′-5′ RNA ligase. In order to study the function and mechanism of the 2′-5′ RNA ligase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from E. coli extracts. A single polypeptide was found to contain RNA ligase activity. This protein was partially sequenced, and the ORF 1The abbreviations used are: ORFopen reading framePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPNKpolynucleotide kinasepre-tRNAintron-containing tRNA precursorbpbase pair(s)tstemperature-sensitivekbpkilobase pair(s). encoding it was identified. This ORF was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA and cloned. The chromosomal locus containing the ligase gene was disrupted, abolishing ligase activity in cellular extracts.

E. coli strains utilized were HB101, XL1-Blue (Novagen), and HSD947, DH10B, RecA+. RNA polymerase III transcription of pre-tRNATyr in yeast extract was performed by the method of Evans and Engelke (15Evans C. Engelke D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using extracts prepared as described. The template for Pol III transcription of pre-tRNATyr was supercoiled pYSUP6 (16Wallace R. Johnson P.F. Tanaka S. Schold M. Itakura K. Abelson J. Science. 1980; 209: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). T7 RNA polymerase transcription was performed as described by Sampson and Saks (17Sampson J. Saks M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). pre-tRNAPhe was transcribed from the artificial pre-tRNA gene of Reyes cloned into pUC13 (18Reyes V. Abelson J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The template for pre-tRNATyr T7 transcription was created by PCR amplification from pYSUP6, adding a canonical T7 promoter at the 5′ end and a BstNI restriction site at the 3′ end of the pre-tRNA, as well as altering the acceptor stem base pairs: C1→ G, T2→ G, A87→ C, and G88→ C to improve transcription yields. This construct was cloned into the pBlueScript vector (Stratagene). tRNA substrates were modified by incubation at 24°C for 45 min in the same extract and reaction conditions as were used for Pol III transcription. tRNA precursors were cleaved as described by Peebles et al. (2Peebles C. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), using partially purified S. cerevisiae tRNA splicing endonuclease fractions from the hydroxyapatite step or later as described in the Rauhut protocol (2Peebles C. Gegenheimer P. Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 32: 525-536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Rauhut R. Green P.R. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18180-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All RNA transcripts were gel purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in 1 × TBE (Tris borate EDTA buffer), 7 M urea and visualized by autoradiography. RNAs were eluted from crushed gel slices in 0.6 M NH4OAc, 2 mM EDTA, 0.005% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature with vortexing for 20 min. RNA eluates were extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, pH 4.5) and chloroform and then ethanol-precipitated in the presence of glycogen and resuspended in distilled water. tRNA half-molecules were annealed for ligation in 2 × ligation buffer (1 × = 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM spermidine, 5% glycerol) by heating to 85°C and slowly cooling to 30°C over 20 min. Ligation reactions were typically performed in 4 μl of 1 × ligation buffer with 250 nM annealled tRNA half-molecules substrate. E. coli lysates or purification fractions (typically 1 μl) were added and incubated for 2-5 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.04% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.001 mg/ml E. coli total RNA for 20 min at 30°C. An equal volume of 90% deionized formamide plus tracking dyes was added, and reactions were incubated at 65°C for 5 min before cooling on ice and loading onto 8% acrylamide, 7 M urea, 1 × TBE gels for electrophoresis. RNA bands were visualized by autoradiography or by exposure to a Molecular Dynamics storage phosphor plate for quantification and analysis on a PhosphorImager using Imagequant software. Cells were grown in media containing 16 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 6 g/liter yeast extract, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 4 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g/liter MgSO4 (anhydrous), and 20 ml/liter glycerol with aeration and constant feeding of 2 × media for 24 h. 5% methanol (which was found to induce ligase activity in extracts to approximately 1.5 × that found in extracts of uninduced cells) was added to media 2 h before harvest, and harvested cell paste was stored at −70°C. All purification procedures were performed in extraction buffer (EB) containing 10% glycerol, 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM Pefabloc (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, and stated concentrations of KCl. 200 g to 1 kg of HB101 cells frozen at −70°C were thawed in a final volume of 1.6 ml/g cells of EB plus 125 mM KCl and dispersed with a hand blender. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice with a Branson Sonifier large tip at 80% power for 15 1-min periods with cooling on ice between. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman 45Ti rotor at 3°C for 1 h. The supernatant was mixed batchwise with 500 ml of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (equilibrated in EB + 125 mM KCl) for 30 min on ice. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The DEAE/extract slurry was poured into a column, and the DEAE effluent was loaded at approximately 1 ml/min onto a 200-ml bed of cellulose phosphate P11 (Whatman) equilibrated in EB + 125 mM KCl. The phosphocellulose column was washed extensively with EB + 500 mM KCl and eluted with a linear KCl gradient from 0.5 to 1.5 M in EB. Peak ligase activity fractions were pooled, diluted to 150 mM KCl, and loaded onto 25 ml of heparin Hyper-D (Biosepra) column. Ligase activity was eluted from the heparin column with a 150-700 mM KCl gradient in EB, and peak fractions were pooled. The heparin pool was diluted to 150 mM KCl in EB and loaded onto a 15-ml bed column of E. coli tRNA linked to a Sepharose support. tRNA Sepharose (3 mg of RNA per ml of gel) was prepared as described by Rauhut et al. (19Rauhut R. Green P.R. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18180-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but using E. coli tRNA (Sigma) instead of yeast tRNA. Ligase was eluted from this column using a gradient from 150 mM to 1 M KCl in EB, followed by a 2 M KCl wash. The ligase eluted in a broad peak beginning around 400 mM KCl, trailing into the 2 M wash. Active fractions were pooled, diluted to 150 mM KCl, loaded onto a 2-ml column of heparin hyper-D, and eluted with EB + 600 mM KCl. This concentrated activity pool was then passed through a 115-ml bed of Superdex 75 gel filtration medium (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at a flow rate of 0.04 ml/min. Peak active fractions were diluted to 150 mM KCl in EB and loaded onto a column of S. cerevisiae tRNA linked to Sepharose (19Rauhut R. Green P.R. Abelson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18180-18184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ligase activity was eluted with a 150-800 mM KCl gradient. Note: For the 4-kg preparative purification mentioned under “Results,” the purification procedure followed was the same as described above except that an S. cerevisiae tRNA affinity column was substituted for the initial E. coli tRNA step, and the tRNA pool was passed through Superdex 75 twice, sequentially. Electrophoresis for preparative elution, as well as all analytical protein electrophoresis, was performed on 16% acrylamide/piperazine diacrylamide (2.67% cross-linking) gels under the conditions of Schagger et al. (20Schagger H. Link T.A. Engel W.D. von Jagow G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized by staining with 0.3 M CuCl2 for 15 min at room temperature, excised, and destained by successive washes in 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.25 M EDTA, and distilled water. Excised bands were crushed and extracted overnight at 4°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Eluted protein was precipitated with 4 volumes of cold acetone, incubated for 30 min at 0°C, and pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, 4°C, for 20 min in an SS-34 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in EB containing 6 M guanidine HCl and microdialyzed versus EB plus 125 mM KCl at 4°C. Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels was performed according to the method of Wray et al. (21Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in 1 × PCR buffer with Mg2+ (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.4 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 10 μM each oligonucleotide primer, and 0.7 units/μl Taq DNA polymerase. For reactions using degenerate primers, 400 μM total primers was used. For labeled probe production, 300 μM dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP were used in the presence 1 μM [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Corp., 3000 Ci/mmol). Labeled PCR product was heated to 95°C in 6 × SSC, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml sonicated calf thymus DNA, and 0.1% dry milk, and then cooled on ice. The probe was hybridized to an E. coli Gene Mapping Membrane (PanVera) in the same buffer at 37°C, overnight. The blot was washed with 6 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and with 5 × SSC at room temperature and then exposed to film for autoradiography. The E. coli RNA ligase gene was cloned by PCR amplification from HB101 genomic DNA using primers corresponding to sequences located 213 bp upstream of the 5′ end and at the exact 3′ end of the predicted ORF, adding EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. Gene disruption was performed according to the method of Hamilton et al. (22Hamilton C. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For genomic disruption, the Kanr Genblock (Pharmacia) cassette was inserted into a PstI site located at +144 bp in the ligase ORF clone. A ts plasmid bearing the interrupted ligase gene was created as follows. The origin-bearing PvuII fragment of pFC20 (23Cornet F. Mortier I. Patte J. Louarn J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3188-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (bp 950-3838) was cloned into pMAK705 (22Hamilton C. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), replacing the PvuII fragment spanning bp 5458-3722. The Kan cassette-interrupted ligase gene was then subcloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of the pMAK polylinker in this construct to create pTSIL. pTSIL was transformed into a RecA+ strain of E. coli (HSD947) and plated at 43°C on chloramphenicol to select for cointegration into the chromosome. Plasmid cointegrants were resolved by growth for several generations in liquid culture at 30°C, at which temperature the plasmid replicon interferes with chromosomal replication. The chromosomal recA locus was then disrupted by P1 phage transduction to prevent further homologous recombination events. Cointegrant cultures were pelleted and resuspended in 0.1 M MgSO4, 5 mM CaCl2 and mixed with an equal volume of P1 lysate JC10240 2M. Saks, personal communication. for 20 min at 30°C and plated on LB + tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin to select for transductants. P1 transductants were screened for resolution of the ts plasmid by streaking separately on chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and nonselective LB plates at 43°C. In previous studies of bacterial RNA ligase, activity had been assayed using substrates derived from tRNA precursors (pre-tRNAs) transcribed either in vivo in yeast or by endogenous RNA polymerase III activity in an S. cerevisiae extract (8Greer C. Javor B Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 33: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was subsequently reported that pre-tRNAPhe transcribed from an artificial tRNAPhe gene by T7 RNA polymerase is an excellent substrate for the S. cerevisiae tRNA splicing enzymes (18Reyes V. Abelson J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 90-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and this was also tested for ligation by E. coli RNA ligase. tRNAPhe half-molecules produced by digestion of T7-transcribed pre-tRNAPhe with S. cerevisiae tRNA splicing endonuclease were, however, poorly ligated in E. coli extracts (data not shown). Since tRNAPhe half-molecule substrates produced in vivo in yeast had previously been demonstrated to be ligated in E. coli extract (8Greer C. Javor B Abelson J. Cell. 1983; 33: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), a requirement for some modification of substrate transcripts was implied. In order to test the putative modification requirement, an S. cerevisiae tRNATyr gene was cloned under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. tRNATyr half-molecules derived from unmodified transcripts of this gene were poor substrates for the E. coli ligase, although they were utilized effectively by the S. cerevisiae tRNA splicing ligase. Fig. 1A shows that when pre-tRNATyr transcripts (lane M) were incubated in the same S. cerevisiae extracts utilized for RNA polymerase III transcription, tRNATyr half-molecules derived from them (lane 1) became substrates for the E. coli RNA ligase (lane 4). E. coli RNA ligase ligation of half-molecules derived from pre-tRNATyr modified in vitro produced a product of equivalent size to that produced by S. cerevisiae tRNA ligase or T4 RNA ligase and polynucleotide kinase (PNK) (lanes 2-3), although the bacterial enzyme is less efficient at joining these substrates. tRNA half-molecule substrates derived from modified T7 RNA polymerase transcripts were utilized by the E. coli RNA ligase as efficiently as yeast polymerase III transcripts, as quantified in a substrate titration experiment shown in Fig. 1B. This was presumably due to the formation of modified nucleosides in these transcripts, as observed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) of nuclease digests of substrate transcripts (data not shown). The identity and location of these modifications were not investigated further. The presence of a 2′-5′ linkage in ligated tRNA products was also observed by nuclease digestion and TLC (not shown), confirming that the reaction had been catalyzed by the previously described E. coli 2′-5′ ligase activity. Pre-tRNAPhe T7 RNA polymerase transcripts modified by incubation in yeast extract were also used to produce substrates for ligation by the E. coli enzyme, although modified tRNATyr half-molecules were preferred as substrates by a factor of 2-3-fold over modified tRNAPhe half-molecules (Fig. 1C). Because tRNATyr half-molecules produced by endonuclease digestion of T7-transcribed, yeast extract-modified pre-tRNATyr were the most active substrates tested for ligation by the E. coli RNA ligase, they were chosen as substrates for quantitative assays of ligase activity during subsequent procedures. A protocol for purification of the E. coli RNA ligase was developed and followed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” A quantitative profile of RNA ligase activity throughout the purification procedure is given in Table I. The complexity of the protein population at each purification step was assayed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and is shown in Fig. 2. Briefly, cells were disrupted by sonication, and the lysate (Fig. 2, lane 1) was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The S-100 supernatant (lane 2) was mixed batchwise with a DEAE anion-exchange resin, and the unbound fraction (lane 3) was loaded onto a cellulose phosphate column. RNA ligase activity was eluted from the cellulose phosphate by an increasing gradient of KCl, and fractions containing peak levels of RNA ligase activity were pooled for further purification by sequential binding to, and salt gradient elution from, heparin and E. coli tRNA affinity matrices. Pooled active fractions were subjected to gel filtration through Superdex 75 media. Peak RNA ligase activity fractions after gel filtration contained a mixture of at least six polypeptides (Fig. 2, lane 8). Superdex 75 peak fractions were then pooled for binding to a column of S. cerevisiae tRNA-Sepharose. RNA ligase activity eluted from this matrix with a salt gradient still contained several polypeptide species (lane 9).Table IPurification profile for preparation of E. coli 2′-5′ RNA ligaseFractionSpecific activityPurification factorYieldfmol ligated/mg protein/minCrude extract17.51(77%)S-100 Supernatant22.81.3100%DEAE effluent246.514NDCellulose phosphate15178760%Heparin Hyper-D238113637%E. coli tRNA-Sepharose278015923%Heparin Hyper-D (II)5826333NDSuperdex 75860649223%S. cerevisiae tRNA-Sepharose18930108217% Open table in a new tab Since the optimized purification procedure did not yield a single homogeneous polypeptide, separation by denaturing electrophoresis was also utilized. A large scale purification was undertaken using 4 kg of E. coli cells as starting material. Final peak ligase activity fractions were pooled and concentrated by dialysis, and an aliquot of the concentrate was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Successive regions of the SDS-PAGE gel lane were excised and individually extracted. Eluted protein from each gel slice was precipitated and resuspended in guanidine HCl. After dialysis, eluates were assayed for RNA ligase activity (Fig. 3A) and examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Only a single eluate showed significant reconstituted activity (Fig. 3A, lane 5). The level of RNA ligase activity in this eluate was not affected by mixing with eluates of other gel slices (not shown). Fig. 3B shows that the active eluate contains only a single E. coli protein (of approximately 20 kDa) in addition to the bovine serum albumin carrier protein added during extraction (compare lane 5 to lane 2). A small amount of a polypeptide of about 20 kDa is present in the low molecular weight eluate (Fig. 3B, lane 3) which may explain the trace ligase activity observed in this fraction (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Due to its ability to reconstitute RNA ligase activity, the 20-kDa protein alone was presumed to be the E. coli RNA ligase. A second aliquot of the concentrated RNA ligase activity pool was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nylon membrane, from which individual protein bands were excised for sequencing. 15 residues of amino-terminal sequence of the 20-kDa RNA ligase protein were obtained and are given in Fig. 4A. This sequence did not match any known protein or predicted ORF in the then current Genbank/EMBL data bases. A set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers corresponding to possible coding sequences for an internal segment of the amino-terminal sequence (shown in Fig. 4A) was synthesized for use in PCR. Fig. 4B shows that these oligonucleotides successfully amplified a DNA fragment of approximately 55 bp from E. coli cells or genomic DNA (lanes 1 and 2) but produced no product using S. cerevisiae cells as a template, or in reactions lacking either primers or template (lanes 3-5). The amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced. In order to facilitate the cloning of the E. coli RNA ligase gene, its chromosomal location was determined using a genomic mapping blot. A radiolabeled DNA probe was created by PCR using the degenerate primers described above and hybridized to a membrane containing the Kohara “mini-set” of ordered, overlapping E. coli genomic phage clones (24Kohara Y. Drlica A. Riley M. The Bacterial Chromosome. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1990: 29-42Google Scholar). Hybridization to this blot (Fig. 4C) revealed two positive phage clones, 11C5 and 15A7, both mapping to the 3.0-min region of the E. coli chromosome and containing about 10 kbp of overlapping genomic DNA. Since sequencing of this genomic region had recently been completed at the Institute for Viral Research in Kyoto (25Fujita N. Mori H. Yura T. Ishuhama A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1637-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the determined amino-terminal protein sequence and 14 bp of unambiguous genomic DNA sequence were submitted for matching against their sequence data base.

Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration resulting from the stimulated Ca2+ influx into neurons successively activates a variety of cellular reactions, including the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (2Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar) and the induction of immediate early genes such as c-fos and zif/268 (3Szekely A.M. Barbaccia M.L. Alho H. Costa E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar, 4Szekely A.M. Costa E. Grayson D.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 4: 624-633Google Scholar). The transduced calcium signals also enhance the activity of nitric oxide synthase through Ca2+/calmodulin (5Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar), resulting in the increased production of NO. Synthesized NO then diffuses out to neighboring cells where it activates soluble guanylate cyclase that can produce cGMP (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). NO may be involved in long term potentiation (7Schuman E.M. Madison D.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and long term depression (8Shibuki K. Okada D. Nature. 1991; 349: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) in the central nervous system. During ischemic brain injury, however, NO may be responsible for neuronal cell death (9Buisson A. Margaill I. Callebert J. Plotkine M. Boulu R.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which can be achieved by the cytosolic Ca2+ overload evoked via overstimulating glutamate receptors. Thus, NO seems to have dual functions as an intercellular messenger for synaptic plasticity and, if in excess, as a neurodestructive effector of neuronal injury. The mechanisms proposed for NO-mediated neurotoxicity include inactivation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (10Heales S.J. Bolanos J.P. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Brain Res. 1994; 668: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), S-nitrosylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (11Mcdonald L.J. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6238-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), inhibition of cis-aconitase (12Drapier J.-C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), activation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthase, and DNA damage (13Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), most of which can be mediated by the formation of nitrosocompounds by cellular components. However, it remains uncertain which cellular mechanisms are exactly responsible for the NO-mediated neurotoxicity. To elucidate these mechanisms, intracellular reactions that can be induced with NO-mediated neuronal cell death must be identified.Activator protein-1 (AP-1) mainly consists of c-Fos and c-Jun, which are the members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, and it mediates immediate-early cellular responses by controlling the transcription of a variety of genes carrying AP-1 recognition sequences termed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE) (14Angel P. Imanaga M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 14: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). The AP-1 DNA binding activity can be modulated by the reduction-oxidation (redox) of a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domains of c-Fos and c-Jun (15Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 16Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). NO from sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, may directly modulate the AP-1 DNA binding activity in vitro (17Tabuchi A. Sano K. Oh E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, reactive oxygen species including superoxide anions also affect c-fos mRNA expression and AP-1 DNA binding activity in cultured cells (18Maki A. Berezesky I.K. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N. Trump B.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 19: 2005-2015Crossref Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Thus, AP-1 DNA binding activity seems to be sensitive to changes in the redox state of cells and, hence, provides a useful molecular tool for investigating the mechanisms responsible for NO-mediated neuronal cell death.Although brain ischemia may cause neuronal injury via a production of reactive oxygen species or NO in vivo (20Beckman J.S. J. Dev. Physiol. 1991; 15: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Cherici G. Alesiani M. Carla V. Moroni F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NO-mediated neuronal cell death can be reproduced in primary cultures of neurons, which can be driven by the formation of peroxynitrite from NO and superoxide anion (22Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). For further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NO-mediated neuronal cell death, we investigated the effect of NO on the AP-1 DNA binding activity using primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Stimulation of cerebellar granule cells with NMDA and KA, which causes the Ca2+ influx into the cells through NMDA receptors and VDCCs, respectively, leads to the activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity resulting from an increase in c-fos mRNA expression (23Sakurai H. Kurusu R. Sano K. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Ohtani K. Sakurai H. Oh E. Iwata E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that NO, released from an NO donor, rapidly causes the post-transcriptional attenuation of AP-1, followed by NO-mediated neuronal cell death.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we found that SNP, a potent NO donor, effectively inhibited the increases in TRE binding activity induced by NMDA or KA in primary cultures of mouse cerebellar granule cells (Fig. 1A). Corresponding to this inhibitory effect of SNP, the amounts of c-Fos proteins in the nuclear extracts decreased when the cells were incubated with SNP (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that the attenuation of AP-1 was induced in the cells incubated with SNP. However, the mode of this AP-1 attenuation by SNP differed in cells stimulated with NMDA or KA. Since the increase in TRE binding activity stimulated by NMDA and KA is dependent upon the Ca2+ influx into neurons through NMDA receptors and VDCCs, respectively (24Ohtani K. Sakurai H. Oh E. Iwata E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the AP-1 attenuation in the cells stimulated by NMDA was assumed to be largely due to the blockade of Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptors by SNP (Fig. 4). In contrast, SNP did not affect the Ca2+ influx evoked via KA stimulation (Fig. 4) although it induced AP-1 attenuation (Figs. 1A and 2A). Since the increase in the c-fos mRNA expression induced by KA was not affected by SNP (Fig. 3B), the AP-1 attenuation is assumed to be post-transcriptionally induced. In support of this notion, the increase in TRE binding activity induced by TPA was also inhibited by SNP (Fig. 1A), while the c-fos mRNA expression stimulated by TPA was not affected (Fig. 3C).Potassium ferrocyanide (K4Fe(CN)6) mimicked the effects of SNP on the Ca2+ influx when the cells were incubated with NMDA or KA, where it blocked the NMDA- but not the KA-induced Ca2+ influx (Fig. 4, Fig. 5A). The blockade of the NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx by SNP and K4Fe(CN)6 is assumed to be due to the ferrocyanide portion of these molecules, which has been suggested by Costa et al. (30Kiedrowski L. Costa E. Wroblewski J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 28: 779-784Google Scholar). Since SNP did not block the Ca2+ influx evoked via Bay K8644 (data not shown), a potent agonist for VDCCs, the ferrocyanide portion of these molecules appears to be unable to block the Ca2+ influx through VDCCs, accounting for the failure of SNP and K4Fe(CN)6 to block the KA-induced Ca2+ influx that is caused through VDCCs (24Ohtani K. Sakurai H. Oh E. Iwata E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6) did not block the increase in 45Ca2+ uptake stimulated by NMDA or KA (data not shown).The possible involvement of NO in the AP-1 attenuation by SNP was supported by the failure of K4Fe(CN)6 to inhibit the increase in TRE binding activity induced by KA (Fig. 5B). The release of NO from SNP and the action of NO on the cells were confirmed by the accumulation of intracellular cGMP in the cells incubated with SNP (data not shown), which can be mediated by guanylate cyclase stimulated by NO (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). However, the AP-1 attenuation observed with the KA stimulation is independent of cGMP signals because 8-Br-cGMP had no effect on the NMDA- and KA-induced increases in TRE binding activity (data not shown). Since ferrocyanide ions do not pass through the cytoplasmic membrane (30Kiedrowski L. Costa E. Wroblewski J.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 28: 779-784Google Scholar), it seems reasonable that NO released from SNP can act on the cells, leading to AP-1 attenuation, directly or indirectly.SNP requires reduction before NO is released (31Bates J.N. Baker M.T. Guerra Jr., R. Harrison D.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: s157-s165Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Actually, only a small signal of NO release from SNP was detected in the culturing medium, which was indirectly examined by the formation of nitrite, while the addition of dithiothreitol, a reducing agent, with SNP dramatically enhanced its formation (data not shown). Therefore, it can be speculated that in culturing medium NO could be released from SNP through the interaction with some reducing equivalents of the cells and subsequently incorporated into the cells. Thus, the mode of action of SNP on the cells remains to be further elucidated.As shown in Fig. 6, SNP potently induced cell death. The cytotoxic effect of SNP can be largely avoided by adding SOD, suggesting that superoxide anion is key to the cell death caused by SNP. Furthermore, the finding that carboxy-PTIO prevented the LDH release (Fig. 6C) revealed the involvement of NO in the SNP cytotoxic effect. The involvement of NO in the SNP-cytotoxic effect was further supported by the failure of K4Fe(CN)6 to induce cell death (Fig. 6A). The simultaneous addition of SOD, catalase, and carboxy-PTIO almost totally prevented SNP-mediated cell death (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant, which can be produced by NO and superoxide anion, is a direct cause of SNP-mediated neuronal cell death rather than NO or superoxide anion alone. However, we do not know exactly how superoxide anion is supplied from the cells.The inhibitory effect of SNP on the increase in TRE binding activity induced by KA was effectively overcome by SOD and catalase (Fig. 7), suggesting that the AP-1 attenuation is associated with neuronal cell death induced by SNP. If so, AP-1 attenuation should be immediately caused before cell death because SNP inhibited the KA-stimulated TRE binding activity within 1 h (Fig. 1A), whereas significant cytotoxic effects were detected 4 h after incubating cells with SNP (Fig. 6A). Thus, the AP-1 attenuation might be an acute response of cells that is required to promote NO-mediated cell death.Reduction-oxidation (redox) regulation is one factor that controls AP-1 DNA binding activity (15Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 16Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteine residues in the DNA-binding domain of AP-1 can be modulated by the redox regulation, leading to the control of AP-1 DNA binding activities (15Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 16Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues interact with NO to produce S-nitrosyl compounds through redox-regulatory mechanisms (32Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 33Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). On the other hand, proteolytic events involving the cysteine proteases such as interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (34Kumar S. Harvey N.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) are necessary for apoptotic cell death. Several kinds of cellular proteins including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (35Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Yaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3777) Google Scholar, 36Wang X. Pai J.T. Wiedenfeld E.A. Medina J.C. Slaughter C.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) are proteolytically degraded in cells undergoing apoptosis. These results support the notion that AP-1 can be attenuated by its proteolytic decomposition, which might be mediated by S-nitrosylation of AP-1.Although SNP inhibits the total protein synthesis in hepatocytes at concentrations over 500 μM (37Curran R.D. Ferrari F.K. Kispert P.H. Stadler J. Stuehr D.J. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we did not detect a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis when SNP was added at a concentration of 100 or 200 μM (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, it seems likely that a selective blockade of c-Fos protein synthesis by SNP is involved in the AP-1 attenuation. Since c-Fos proteins can be rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-related proteolytic pathway after their syntheses (38Tsurumi C. Ishida N. Tamura N. Kakizuka T. Nishida E. Okumura E. Kishimoto T. Inagaki M. Okazaki K. Sagata N. Ichihara A. Tanaka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), c-Fos proteins should disappear from the cells immediately after inhibiting protein synthesis. Other scenarios in which AP-1 attenuation involving its translocation to the nucleus being blocked by SNP can be excluded, because the amounts of c-Fos proteins decreased in both the nuclear and total cellular extracts (Fig. 2, A and B).Various insults to the brain such as hypoxic ischemia (HI) and status epilepticus (SE) can cause two types of neuronal cell death; moderate HI and SE lead to apoptosis, whereas more severe HI leads to necrosis (39Dragunow M. Preston K. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 21: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). While moderate HI and SE induce a prolonged c-fos mRNA expression in brain neurons (39Dragunow M. Preston K. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 21: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), severe HI rapidly induces c-fos mRNA expression but does not cause the accumulation of c-Fos proteins in the brain (40Kiessling M. Stumm G. Xie Y. Herdegen T. Aguzzi A. Bravo R. Gass P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 22: 914-924Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that the attenuation of c-Fos proteins could be post-transcriptionally induced in brain neurons by severe HI. Even in primary cultures of neurons, production of peroxynitrite can elicit not only apoptotic neuronal cell death with moderate exposure, but also necrosis with severe exposure (41Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). In addition, apoptotic and necrotic cell death can also be induced in cerebellar granule cells incubated with glutamate (42Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.K. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the rapid attenuation of AP-1 is one indicator of acute neuronal cell death mediated by NO, which could be caused by ischemic brain injury.

Synthesized NO then diffuses out to neighboring cells where it activates soluble guanylate cyclase that can produce cGMP (6Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). NO may be involved in long term potentiation (7Schuman E.M. Madison D.V. Science. 1991; 254: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) and long term depression (8Shibuki K. Okada D. Nature. 1991; 349: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) in the central nervous system. During ischemic brain injury, however, NO may be responsible for neuronal cell death (9Buisson A. Margaill I. Callebert J. Plotkine M. Boulu R.G. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), which can be achieved by the cytosolic Ca2+ overload evoked via overstimulating glutamate receptors. Thus, NO seems to have dual functions as an intercellular messenger for synaptic plasticity and, if in excess, as a neurodestructive effector of neuronal injury. The mechanisms proposed for NO-mediated neurotoxicity include inactivation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (10Heales S.J. Bolanos J.P. Land J.M. Clark J.B. Brain Res. 1994; 668: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), S-nitrosylation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (11Mcdonald L.J. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6238-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), inhibition of cis-aconitase (12Drapier J.-C. Hirling H. Wietzerbin J. Kaldy P. Kuhn L.C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3643-3649Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), activation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthase, and DNA damage (13Zhang J. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Science. 1994; 263: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), most of which can be mediated by the formation of nitrosocompounds by cellular components. However, it remains uncertain which cellular mechanisms are exactly responsible for the NO-mediated neurotoxicity. To elucidate these mechanisms, intracellular reactions that can be induced with NO-mediated neuronal cell death must be identified.Activator protein-1 (AP-1) mainly consists of c-Fos and c-Jun, which are the members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, and it mediates immediate-early cellular responses by controlling the transcription of a variety of genes carrying AP-1 recognition sequences termed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element (TRE) (14Angel P. Imanaga M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 14: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). The AP-1 DNA binding activity can be modulated by the reduction-oxidation (redox) of a single conserved cysteine residue in the DNA-binding domains of c-Fos and c-Jun (15Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher III, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 16Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). NO from sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, may directly modulate the AP-1 DNA binding activity in vitro (17Tabuchi A. Sano K. Oh E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, reactive oxygen species including superoxide anions also affect c-fos mRNA expression and AP-1 DNA binding activity in cultured cells (18Maki A. Berezesky I.K. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N. Trump B.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 19: 2005-2015Crossref Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Thus, AP-1 DNA binding activity seems to be sensitive to changes in the redox state of cells and, hence, provides a useful molecular tool for investigating the mechanisms responsible for NO-mediated neuronal cell death.Although brain ischemia may cause neuronal injury via a production of reactive oxygen species or NO in vivo (20Beckman J.S. J. Dev. Physiol. 1991; 15: 53-59PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pellegrini-Giampietro D.E. Cherici G. Alesiani M. Carla V. Moroni F. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NO-mediated neuronal cell death can be reproduced in primary cultures of neurons, which can be driven by the formation of peroxynitrite from NO and superoxide anion (22Lipton S.A. Choi Y.-B. Pan Z.-H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.-S.V. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). For further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NO-mediated neuronal cell death, we investigated the effect of NO on the AP-1 DNA binding activity using primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Stimulation of cerebellar granule cells with NMDA and KA, which causes the Ca2+ influx into the cells through NMDA receptors and VDCCs, respectively, leads to the activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity resulting from an increase in c-fos mRNA expression (23Sakurai H. Kurusu R. Sano K. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Ohtani K. Sakurai H. Oh E. Iwata E. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that NO, released from an NO donor, rapidly causes the post-transcriptional attenuation of AP-1, followed by NO-mediated neuronal cell death."

https://openalex.org/W2044295225,"We investigated the effect of peptide G, a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence of the 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor, on the interaction of laminin in two tumor cell lines one of which produces laminin and one of which does not. Addition of peptide G to the culture medium induced a significant increase in the amount of endogenous laminin detectable on the cell membrane of both cell lines. Moreover, pretreatment of exogenous laminin with peptide G dramatically increased laminin binding on both cell lines. Kinetics analysis of membrane-bound labeled laminin revealed a 3-fold decrease in the kd of peptide G-treated laminin compared with untreated or unrelated or scrambled peptide-treated laminin. Moreover, the affinity constant of peptide G-treated laminin increased 2-fold, with a doubling of the number of laminin binding sites, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Expression of the VLA6 integrin receptor on the cell membrane increased after incubation with peptide G-treated laminin. However, the lower binding inhibition of peptide G-treated laminin after anti-VLA6 antibody or cation chelation treatment indicates that membrane molecules in addition to integrin receptors are involved in the recognition of peptide G-modified laminin. These “new” laminin-binding proteins also mediated cell adhesion to laminin, the first step in tumor invasion. Together, the data suggest that peptide G increases and stabilizes laminin binding on tumor cells, involving surface receptors that normally do not take part in this interaction. This might explain the abundant clinical and experimental data suggesting a key role for the 67-kDa laminin receptor in the interaction between cancer cells and the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin during tumor invasion and metastasis. We investigated the effect of peptide G, a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence of the 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor, on the interaction of laminin in two tumor cell lines one of which produces laminin and one of which does not. Addition of peptide G to the culture medium induced a significant increase in the amount of endogenous laminin detectable on the cell membrane of both cell lines. Moreover, pretreatment of exogenous laminin with peptide G dramatically increased laminin binding on both cell lines. Kinetics analysis of membrane-bound labeled laminin revealed a 3-fold decrease in the kd of peptide G-treated laminin compared with untreated or unrelated or scrambled peptide-treated laminin. Moreover, the affinity constant of peptide G-treated laminin increased 2-fold, with a doubling of the number of laminin binding sites, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Expression of the VLA6 integrin receptor on the cell membrane increased after incubation with peptide G-treated laminin. However, the lower binding inhibition of peptide G-treated laminin after anti-VLA6 antibody or cation chelation treatment indicates that membrane molecules in addition to integrin receptors are involved in the recognition of peptide G-modified laminin. These “new” laminin-binding proteins also mediated cell adhesion to laminin, the first step in tumor invasion. Together, the data suggest that peptide G increases and stabilizes laminin binding on tumor cells, involving surface receptors that normally do not take part in this interaction. This might explain the abundant clinical and experimental data suggesting a key role for the 67-kDa laminin receptor in the interaction between cancer cells and the basement membrane glycoprotein laminin during tumor invasion and metastasis. The complex process of tumor invasion and metastasis is a cascade of sequential steps in which interactions between cancer cells and laminin, the major glycoprotein of the basal membrane, play a critical role (1Liotta L.A.

The nascent translation product (37LRP) of hybridized human laminin receptor mRNA has an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and pulse-chase experiments have revealed that the 37-kDa polypeptide is a precursor of the mature 67LR (23Castronovo V.

A 20-amino acid synthetic peptide derived from the 37LRP sequence, designated peptide G, was found to bind to laminin (9Castronovo V. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20440-20446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, this peptide eluted the 67LR from a laminin affinity column (9Castronovo V. Taraboletti G. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20440-20446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its interaction with laminin was found to be heparin-dependent (25Guo N. Krutzsch H.C. Vogel T. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17743-17747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, peptide G significantly increased the metastatic potential of melanoma cells (26Taraboletti G. Belotti D. Giavazzi R. Sobel M.E. Castronovo V. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the observations of high metastatic potential of laminin-coated tumor cells (27Varani J. Lovett E.J. McCoy J.P. Shibata S. Maddose D.E. Goldstein I.J. Wicha M. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 111: 27-34PubMed Google Scholar, 28Malinoff H.L. McCoy J.P. Varani J. Wicha M.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1984; 33: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggest the relevance of interactions between the 67LR expressed on the tumor cell surface, integrin receptors, and laminin in the metastatic process. Recently, coexpression of the 67LR and the integrin laminin receptor VLA6 on small cell lung cancer cells was demonstrated (29Pellegrini, R., Martignone, S., Ménard, S., Colnaghi, M. I., (1994) Int. J. Cancer, Suppl. 8, 116–120.Google Scholar), as well as their colocalization in the same cytoplasmic compartment and on the cell membrane as determined by immunoelectronmicroscopy (30Romanov V. Sobel M.E. da Silva P.P. Ménard S. Castronovo V. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After exposure of the cells to laminin, a number of these cytoplasmic molecules translocated from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (30Romanov V. Sobel M.E. da Silva P.P. Ménard S. Castronovo V. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In light of these data, we investigated the role of the 67LR in the interaction of laminin with the tumor cell surface using peptide G. We found that peptide G stabilized laminin binding to tumor cells by increasing the number of laminin binding receptors and by decreasing the kd of laminin from the cell surface. Peptide G (IPCNNKGAHSVGLMWWMLAR), corresponding to the 161-180 region of the 37LRP; scrambled peptide GX (PMLRWGCHIAMVNKLSWGNA); and both hydrophobic and neutral peptide X (CEQKEENQGKNESNIKPVQTV) were obtained from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) in N-terminal biotinylated form. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis showed 95% purity of peptides G and X and 85% purity of peptide GX. Peptides were dissolved in distilled water and centrifuged, and the concentration was evaluated by densitometry. Whereas peptide G and X were easily dissolved, peptide GX was rather insoluble and 60% was lost after centrifugation. Peptides were stored at −20°C at 1 mg/ml concentration. Laminin purified from the mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor was kindly provided by Dr. G. Taraboletti (Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Bergamo, Italy). After iodination to a specific activity of 6 μCi/μg using the lactoperoxidase method (31Canevari S. Orlandi R. Ripamonti M. Tagliabue E. Aguanno S. Miotti S. Ménard S. Colnaghi M.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 75: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), laminin (50 μg) was treated with peptide G, X, or GX (50 μg each) in a final volume of 1 ml for 30 min at 37°C. Human placenta collagen was obtained from Sigma. Vulvar epidermoid carcinoma A431 and small cell lung carcinoma N592 human cell lines were provided by American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma,) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), L-glutamine, and antibiotics. Microwells of a 96-well polyvinyl chloride plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, CA) were coated with 100 μl of laminin, collagen, or ovalbumin (10 μg/ml) in PBS and 0.01% of BSA for 2 h at 37°C. After three washes with PBS, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Biotinylated peptide G, X, or GX was added at 1 μg/ml in 100 μl PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% BSA (binding buffer), and wells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with gentle rocking, washed four times with binding buffer, and incubated further with 125I-avidin (1 × 105 cpm/well; Amersham Corp.) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed, wells were treated with 100 μl of 2 N NaOH for 20 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was assessed for radioactivity in a gamma counter. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Specific cpm was calculated as the difference between cpm bound to laminin or collagen and cpm bound to ovalbumin. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to analyze the binding of biotinylated peptides, the presence of endogenous or exogenous laminin, and expression of the α6 integrin subunit and human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Live cells (3 × 105), treated with murine laminin (50 μg/ml) or untreated, were incubated with biotinylated peptides at 37°C for 30 min. After three washings, cells were assayed for bound peptide G, GX, or X with fluorescein-labeled streptavidin (5 μg/ml; Amersham Corp.). To analyze endogenous laminin production on the cell surface, A431 cells (3 × 105) treated for 30 min with peptides or untreated were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal serum directed against human laminin (1:100) (Telios Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA), washed three times, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 30 min at 0°C, washed three times, and analyzed. Murine laminin, treated with peptides (50, 25, 12.5, 6, 3, and 1.5 μg/ml) or untreated, was incubated with cells for 30 min at 37°C and detected using a rabbit polyclonal serum directed against murine laminin (1:200; Telios) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig. Expression of the α6 integrin subunit and HLA under various conditions was studied by incubation with purified mAbs, MAR6 (32Bottini C. Miotti S. Fiorucci S. Facheris P. Ménard S. Colnaghi M.I. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and W6/32, directed against the α6 subunit and against a monomorphic epitope on the 45-kDa polypeptide products of the HLA A, B, and C loci (Coulter Immunology, Hialeah, FL), respectively (10 μg/ml mAbs), followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. Labeled cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer with LYSYS II software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, with highly reproducible results. Staining of cells with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig, fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse Ig, or fluorescein-labeled streptavidin was performed to determine background values. A431 and N592 cells (2 × 105 cells/sample) were incubated in complete culture medium for 30 min at 37°C with 125I-laminin (106 cpm/sample) alone or complexed with peptide G or peptide X, washed five times, incubated at 37°C, and tested at different times (from 0 to 720 min) for residual radioactivity. Cell viability after a 720-min incubation was more than 90% as determined by trypan blue exclusion staining. Bound laminin was calculated as a percentage of the initial binding. Results are given as the average of triplicate determinations; counts in each experiment differed by <10%. The kd was calculated as follows: loge(X0/X1) = kd × t1, where X0 = bound radioactivity at 0 min and X1 = bound radioactivity at 720 min (t1). N592 cells (2 × 105 cells/sample) were incubated for 180 min at 0°C with 100 μl of 125I-laminin treated with peptide G or X or untreated, at different serial dilutions in the presence or absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled laminin. After four washings, cells were assessed for bound radioactivity in a γ counter. The number of binding sites per cell was extrapolated from the Scatchard plot, and the affinity constant (K) was evaluated as the slope of the regression curve (33Casalini P. Mezzanzanica D. Canevari S. Della Torre G. Miotti S. Colnaghi M.I. Matzku S. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). N592 cells (2 × 105 cells/sample) were incubated with 50 μl of iodinated laminin (106 cpm/sample) treated with peptide G and X or untreated. In one experiment, N592 cells were saturated with 50 μl of GOH3 mAb (200 μg/ml; Dako, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) directed against the laminin binding site of α6 integrin subunit, and were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with labeled laminin treated with the peptides or untreated. After being washed, cells were assessed for bound radioactivity and the percent binding inhibition calculated as follows: 100 − (bound cpm to treated cells/bound cpm to control cells × 100). In a second experiment, N592 cells (2 × 105 cells/sample) were equilibrated with 80 mM Na2HPO4, 20 mM NaH2PO4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 μM EDTA, pH 7.4 (EDTA buffer) to deplete extracellular levels of divalent cations and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 125I-laminin dissolved in complete PBS or EDTA buffer and treated with peptide G or X or untreated. After three washings, cells were assayed for bound radioactivity and percent binding inhibition was calculated as above. N592 cells, coated with 200 μg/ml of GOH3 mAb (Dako) or uncoated, were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well, alone or with 10 μg of laminin previously treated with peptide G or X (50 μg/ml) or untreated. After a 90-min incubation as described (29Pellegrini, R., Martignone, S., Ménard, S., Colnaghi, M. I., (1994) Int. J. Cancer, Suppl. 8, 116–120.Google Scholar), followed by three washings, adherent cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C with 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (Sigma) dissolved in PBS at 5 μg/ml. Acid isopropyl alcohol (100 μl of 0.04 N HCl in isopropyl alcohol) was added to the wells and mixed thoroughly to dissolve the dark blue crystals for 5 min at room temperature. Plates were read on a Titertek Multiskan spectrophotometer (Flow Laboratories, Inc., McLean, VA) at a wavelength of 550 nm. Specific A550 was calculated as follows: A550 of treated sample − A550 of control. Untreated N592 cells served as a control. The binding of N-terminal biotinylated peptides G, GX, and X to laminin was investigated in a solid-phase binding assay. Peptide G bound specifically to laminin but not to collagen, whereas neither peptide X nor peptide GX bound to either molecule (Fig. 1). Cytofluorimetric analysis of peptide G binding to A431 tumor cells, which express laminin on the cell surface, and to N592 cells, which do not produce laminin, revealed positive and negative binding, respectively; treatment with exogenous laminin strongly increased the binding to A431 cells (Fig. 2A) and rendered N592 cells positive for peptide G binding (Fig. 2B). Peptide GX and peptide X binding were not detectable on either cell line even after laminin treatment (Fig. 3). Binding of peptide G, preincubated with laminin for 30 min at 37°C before addition to tumor cells, was 10-fold higher in A431 cells and 100-fold higher in N592 cells (Fig. 4A) compared to peptide G binding on the respective cells coated with exogenous laminin (Fig. 4B).Fig. 3Peptide X and GX binding to tumor cell lines. A431 (A) and N592 (B) cells, treated with murine laminin (light line) or untreated (bold line), were incubated with peptide X (panels A and B) or GX (panels C and D) in the conditions described in the legend to Fig. 2.

Peptide G (50 μg/ml) was added to A431 (A) and N592 (B) cells (3 × 105 cells/sample) for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of exogenous laminin in suspension (dotted line) or in the presence of exogenous laminin coated onto the cell surface (bold line). Bound peptide was monitored with fluorescein-labeled streptavidin (5 μg/ml). Light lines show background values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effect of peptide G on the binding of endogenous or exogenous laminin to the cell surface was investigated. A431 cells were treated for 24 h with 50 μg/ml peptide G, GX, or X and analyzed by cytofluorimetry for the amount of laminin present on the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 5, the amount of endogenous laminin detected on the cell membrane was 10-fold higher in peptide G-treated cells than in untreated cells. Peptide G treatment of N592 cells under the same conditions did not induce laminin detection (data not shown). Both A431 and N592 cells were able to bind exogenous laminin, but laminin pretreatment with peptide G increased this binding by 30- and 100-fold, respectively, whereas peptides X and GX had no such effect (Fig. 6). The peptide G-induced increase in binding of murine laminin was concentration-dependent; titration of peptide G from 50 to 1 μg/ml indicated that 3 μg/ml, corresponding to a 30-fold excess of peptide, doubled the levels of laminin bound to A431 cells.Fig. 6Increased cell surface binding of exogenous laminin in the presence of peptide G. A431 (A) and N592 (B) cells were treated for 30 min at 37°C with murine laminin, alone (dashed line) or preincubated with peptide G (light line), peptide X (dotted line), or peptide GX (dashed-dotted line) at 50 μg/ml. Exogenous laminin was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using a rabbit polyclonal serum directed against murine laminin (1:200) and fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-rabbit Ig. Bold lines show background values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the effect of peptide G treatment on laminin binding affinity, the time course of dissociation of membrane-bound peptide-treated 125I-laminin was analyzed in N592 and A431 cells. After 12 h, A431 cells released 50% of labeled laminin treated with peptide X (kd = 13.8 × 10−6 s−1) or untreated laminin (kd = 16 × 10−6 s−1) into the supernatant, whereas peptide G-treated laminin dissociation was only 25% (kd = 6.3 × 10−6 s−1) (Fig. 7A). In N592 cells, the peptide-induced effects were even more pronounced, with only 12% of peptide G-treated laminin dissociation (kd = 2.9 × 10−6 s−1) versus 35% of peptide X-treated (kd = 9.2 × 10−6 s−1) or untreated (kd = 9.9 × 10−6 s−1) laminin dissociation (Fig. 7B). Different amounts of labeled laminin, treated with peptide G or X or untreated, were tested for binding. The ratio between bound and free ligand in relation to the bound ligand was calculated by Scatchard analysis. The intercept on the x axis indicated that the number of binding sites recognizing the peptide G-treated laminin was double the number of binding sites recognizing untreated or peptide X-treated laminin, whereas the slope of the rate was slightly increased, corresponding to K values of 3 × 109, 1.6 × 109, and 1.8 × 109 M−1 for peptide G-treated, untreated, and peptide X-treated laminin, respectively (Fig. 8). The effect of peptide G-treated laminin on expression of the α6 integrin subunit, which is part of the VLA6 coexpressed with 67LR on N592 cells, was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The cells expressed a small amount of the α6 subunit, which increased slightly after incubation with peptide G-treated laminin but not after incubation with laminin alone or with peptide X-treated laminin (Fig. 9A). HLA expression, evaluated as a control, showed no changes (Fig. 9B). To identify the membrane receptors involved in the binding of peptide G-treated laminin, N592 cells previously saturated with a high concentration of an anti-α6 mAb (GOH3), directed against the laminin binding site of the α6 integrin subunit, were analyzed for their residual ability to bind labeled laminin pretreated with the peptides (G or X) or untreated. As shown in Fig. 10, the antibody treatment inhibited 125I-laminin binding on the cell surface by 40% when the adhesion molecule was untreated or treated with peptide X and by only 20% when labeled laminin was incubated with peptide G. Because divalent cations are required for integrin activity, the binding of labeled laminin, untreated or treated with the two peptides, was assayed in EDTA buffer. Binding of untreated laminin or peptide X-treated laminin was inhibited by 50%; in comparison, peptide G-treated laminin was inhibited by 30% (Fig. 10). An adhesion assay in which N592 cells in suspension were seeded in medium containing untreated or peptide-treated laminin was used to investigate the effect of peptide G treatment of soluble laminin on cell adhesiveness. Laminin alone or treated with peptide X induced 30% cell adhesion, whereas peptide G-treated laminin induced nearly 90% adhesion. Treatment of these cells with mAb GOH3 decreased adhesion by 50% in all samples (Fig. 11). In the present study, peptide G, corresponding to the 67LR laminin binding domain, increased and stabilized laminin binding on tumor cells. This effect is specific because two other peptides of the same length, one hydrophobic and poorly soluble and one neutral, did not induce these effects. The stabilization, evaluated as a decrease in the kd of membrane-bound laminin, is due principally to an increase in the number of laminin binding sites on the cell surface and a slight increase in affinity. Scatchard analysis indicated a 2-fold increase in the affinity constant of peptide G-treated laminin and a 3-fold decrease in its kd. Assuming that the mass equilibrium equation used in the Scatchard plot analysis is adequate for this system, the differences in K and kd correspond to a 1.5-fold decrease in the association constant. This means that peptide G-treated laminin binds to cells with a similar or slightly lower association rate than untreated laminin, but once bound, it remains associated with the membrane far longer than does untreated laminin. The higher kd in A431 cells can be attributed to production of endogenous laminin, which competes with the labeled laminin for cell binding. Thus, findings on N592 cells were considered more reliable, and this cell line was chosen for Scatchard analysis. Peptide G has been shown to bind heparin, and its role in mediating the interaction with laminin through heparin has been suggested (25Guo N. Krutzsch H.C. Vogel T. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17743-17747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because heparan sulfate is likely present in all laminin preparations, as well as in culture medium, the binding of peptide G to purified laminin or to endogenously produced laminin is not indicative of a direct peptide G-laminin interaction but rather might reflect an indirect effect mediated through heparin. In either case, the final effect at the cell membrane level is a stabilization of laminin binding. The increase in α6 expression on the membrane upon treatment with peptide G-modified laminin strongly suggests that the VLA6 integrin, the only α6-containing integrin expressed on N592 cells (29Pellegrini, R., Martignone, S., Ménard, S., Colnaghi, M. I., (1994) Int. J. Cancer, Suppl. 8, 116–120.Google Scholar), participates in the binding increase. Considering that laminin might sterically interfere with the detection of its receptor, α6 expression could well be underestimated. Indeed, treatment of N592 cells with laminin had been shown to induce translocation of both 67LR and α6 from the cytoplasm to the cell's outer surface (30Romanov V. Sobel M.E. da Silva P.P. Ménard S. Castronovo V. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The decreased inhibition of binding of peptide G-treated laminin observed after mAb GOH3 or cation chelation treatment (34Sonnenberg A. Modderman P.W. Hogervorst F.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), together with the finding that laminin did not dissociate from suspended cells at a time in which integrins might be inactivated, suggests that the laminin binding molecules involved in recognition of the peptide G-modified laminin are not restricted to the integrin family. Because the 67LR binds to laminin with different binding sites (36Mecham R.P. Whitehouse L. Hay M. Hinek A. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the possibility that membrane 67LR itself plays a role in the recognition of peptide G-treated laminin cannot be excluded. One possible explanation for the peptide G-induced increase in laminin binding ability is that the peptide changes the conformation of laminin. We found a greater increase in binding when laminin was treated in solution with peptide G than when it was first allowed to react with cells and then treated with the peptide. Thus, soluble laminin might be more sensitive to a conformational change than bound laminin. Because receptor recognition domains of laminin appear to be conformation-dependent (8Mercurio A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 419-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), this modified laminin may interact better with integrins or other surface molecules that normally do not participate with significant affinity in laminin binding to the cell surface (37Ramos D.M. Berston E.D. Kramer R.H. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 728-734PubMed Google Scholar, 38Feldman L.E. Shin K.C. Natale R.B. Todd R.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1065-1070PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kleinman H.K.

The involvement of different laminin binding molecules, recognizing different sites, increases the probability of multivalent linkages that stabilize the binding. Integrins and other laminin-binding proteins may cooperate to provide specific recognition of the laminin modified by peptide G; “new” laminin-binding proteins might receive functional signals from the multiple integrins involved, and this information might increase their binding specificity. Such new laminin-binding proteins might also mediate N592 cell adhesion to laminin, as indicated by the increased cell attachment to peptide G-treated laminin compared with the untreated adhesion molecule. Indeed, mAb GOH3, which has been reported to partially inhibit N592 cell adhesion (29Pellegrini, R., Martignone, S., Ménard, S., Colnaghi, M. I., (1994) Int. J. Cancer, Suppl. 8, 116–120.Google Scholar), reduced cell attachment to the same extent in the presence of untreated or peptide-treated laminin. Peptide G also increases the binding of endogenous laminin on the cell surface: in fact, addition of the peptide to the culture medium for 24 h increased the expression of membrane laminin in laminin-producing cells. We recently showed that tumor cells release 67LR into the medium and that the soluble form retains its ability to bind laminin (40Karpatová M. Tagliabue E. Castronovo V. Magnifico A. Ardini E. Morelli D. Belotti D. Colnaghi M.I. Ménard S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This soluble receptor might induce the same conformational change in laminin as that induced by peptide G, leading to increased laminin binding to the cell surface. This mechanism, which provides the cells with a greater number of binding sites, might modulate the interaction between tumor cells and laminin, with consequences for their metastatic potential. Consistent with this suggestion, 67LR expression has been associated with an unfavorable prognosis in breast carcinomas, but only in those producing laminin (24Pellegrini R. Martignone S. Tagliabue E. Belotti D. Bufalino R. Ménard S. Colnaghi M.I. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the role of the 67LR in tumor progression appears to be related to its ability to increase and stabilize laminin binding on tumor cells that, when coated with laminin, show increased metastatic potential (26Taraboletti G. Belotti D. Giavazzi R. Sobel M.E. Castronovo V. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We thank L. Mameli and D.

It was found that they possessed an enzyme with a lysine at position 487 (E487K) instead of glutamate (Glu487). We previously found that the Km for NAD of recombinant human and rat E487K enzymes increased more than 150-fold (Farrés, J., Wang X., Takahashi, K., Cunningham, S.

In this study liver tissue from heterozygous people was analyzed and found to possess mRNAs for both the glutamate and the lysine subunits. Western blot analysis showed that the glutamate subunit was present. The cDNAs for Glu487 and E487K were coexpressed on one plasmid in Escherichia coli, and the enzyme forms were separated from each other by isoelectric focusing to show that heterotetramers were formed. Only one Km value for NAD could be measured with the purified heterotetrameric enzyme that possessed just 16-18% activity of the glutamate homotetrameric enzyme. The E487K homotetramers had 8% specific activity of the Glu487 enzyme. There was no pre-steady state burst of NADH formation with the heterotetramer, a property found with the glutamate enzyme. Similar results were found for the coexpressed rat liver enzyme, except that a higher specific activity, 48%, was obtained. Thus, we conclude that presence of the lysine subunit altered the activity of the glutamate subunit in the heterotetramer to make it function more like an E487K enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2102041216,"An increasing amount of experimental data suggest that cross-talk exists between pathways involving tyrosine kinases and heterotrimeric G proteins. In a previous study, we demonstrated that bradykinin (BK) increases the intracellular accumulation of cAMP in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 by stimulating adenylate cyclase activity via a stimulatory G protein (Gsα) (Liebmann, C., Graneß, A., Ludwig, B., Adomeit, A., Boehmer, A., Boehmer, F.-D., Nürnberg, B., and Wetzker, R. (1996) Biochem. J. 313, 109-118). Here, we present several lines of evidence indicating the ability of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to suppress BK-induced activation of the cAMP pathway in A431 cells via tyrosine phosphorylation of Gsα. Gsα was specifically immunoprecipitated from A431 cells using the anti-αs antiserum AS 348. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Gsα was detectable in EGF-pretreated cells with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Additionally, A431 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in vivo and treated with EGF, and the resolved immunoprecipitates were subjected to amino acid analysis. The results clearly indicate that EGF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Gsα in A431 cells. Treatment of A431 cells with EGF decreased BK-induced cAMP accumulation in intact cells as well as the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by BK, NaF, and guanyl nucleotides, but not by forskolin. Also, EGF treatment abolished both the BK- and isoprenaline-induced stimulation of guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate) binding to Gsα. In contrast, the BK-evoked, Gq-mediated stimulation of inositol phosphate formation in A431 cells was not affected by EGF pretreatment. Thus, EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gsα is accompanied by a loss of its susceptibility to G protein-coupled receptors and its ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase via guanyl nucleotide exchange. We propose that Gsα may represent a key regulatory protein in the cross-talk between the signal transduction pathways of BK and EGF in A431 cells.

There is mounting evidence indicative of complex, probably cell-specific interactions between signaling pathways involving heterotrimeric G proteins and tyrosine kinases. For example, the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors modulates key proteins of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway via protein kinase C- or protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation on serine or threonine residues (1Koich W.

Furthermore, several isoforms of α subunits of G proteins were shown to be phosphorylated in vitro on tyrosine residues by tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorBKbradykininGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGpp(NH)p5′-guanylylimidodiphosphatePIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). receptor and the insulin receptor or by non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src kinase family. EGF was shown to activate cardiac adenylate cyclase via a mechanism requiring both Gsα and the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase (4Nair B.G. Parikh B. Milligan G. Patel T.B. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism of these receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated effects remained unclear. In reconstituted phospholipid vesicles, the insulin receptor was found to catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα and Goα, suggesting the possibility of a direct interaction of receptor tyrosine kinases and G proteins (8Krupinsky J.

Further progress in this field came from in vitro studies of Hausdorff et al. (9Hausdorff W.P. Pitcher J.A. Luttrell D.K. Lindner M.E. Kurose H. Parsons S.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

In 1995, the in vitro sites of phosphorylation of Gsα by pp60c−src were identified (10Moyers J.S. Lindner M.E. Shannon J.D. Parsons S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosine residues are located at N-terminal position 37 and at C-terminal position 377 of Gsα and thus in regions known to participate in nucleotide exchange and receptor interaction (10Moyers J.S.

Patel T.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6947-6951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) demonstrated an activation of Gsα via phosphorylation on tyrosine residues by EGF receptor kinase. However, little is known about tyrosine phosphorylation of Gsα in intact cells and how such phosphorylation might affect the function of the G protein. We have recently shown that bradykinin (BK) activates dual pathways in A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells, i.e. the phospholipase C-β/protein kinase C pathway and, independently via Gsα, the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway, which represents a negative feedback loop to the BK-induced protein kinase C activation (13Liebmann C.

At the same time, as observed earlier by Hosoi et al. (14Hosoi K. Kurihara K. Uhea T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the BK-induced activation of protein kinase C leads to an increased serine/threonine phosphorylation of EGF receptors and, subsequently, to a reduced binding of EGF.

In this paper, we present experimental evidence that EGF treatment of A431 cells results in both inhibition of BK-induced [35S]GTPγS binding to Gsα and BK-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in A431 membranes as well as inhibition of BK-induced cAMP accumulation in intact A431 cells. Furthermore, we show that EGF stimulation leads to specific tyrosine phosphorylation, but also to an increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of Gsα. This is the first report demonstrating possible functional consequences of Gsα tyrosine phosphorylation in intact cells. A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 7.5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics. Treatment of intact cells with BK and various agents as outlined in the figure legends was performed with nearly confluent cultures. An A431 particulate fraction (referred to as “membranes”) was prepared as described before (13Liebmann C. Graneß A. Ludwig B. Adomeit A. Boehmer A. Boehmer F.-D. Nürnberg B. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The activity of adenylate cyclase in A431 membranes was determined according to Schultz and Jakobs (17Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Bergmeyer H.H. Bergmeyer J. Graßl M. Methods in Enzymatic Analysis.Vol. IV. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1983: 369-388Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, membranes (80 μg of protein/assay) were incubated for 20 min at 25°C in a standard mixture containing [α-32P]ATP (∼2 × 107 cpm/tube), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.1 mM cAMP, 0.1 mM ATP, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 150 units of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. To inactivate angiotensin-converting enzyme, which degrades BK, the incubation mixture was supplemented with 1 μM captopril. Variable additions such as NaF (as [AlF4]−), forskolin, GTPγS, and BK were added as indicated, giving a total assay volume of 100 μl. The samples were preincubated for 5 min at 25°C, and the reaction was started by adding the membranes. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of ZnCl2 solution (125 mM) followed by 500 μl of Na2CO3 solution (125 mM). The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and 800 μl of the supernatant fluid were transferred to alumina oxid 90 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)-containing columns. After draining of the sample, labeled cAMP was eluted by the subsequent addition of 2 × 2 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM), pH 7.5, and [32P]Pi was determined by measuring Cerenkov radiation. For each column, cAMP recovery was estimated individually using [3H]cAMP. A431 cells in 24-well plates were treated with serum-free DMEM overnight, and then the medium was changed to HEPES-buffered serum-free DMEM, which had been adjusted to pH 7.2 just prior usage. Then, cells were exposed to the agents tested in 500 μl of serum-free medium supplemented with 100 μM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 10 μM captopril. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold ethanol (96%, v/v), giving a final concentration of 65% (v/v). The cells were scraped off the plates, and the ethanolic extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 6 min at room temperature. The supernatants containing the extracted cAMP were removed, and the pellets were washed with 500 μl of ethanol (65% v/v) and centrifuged as described above. Supernatants were pooled, evaporated to dryness at 60°C, and resolved in 600 μl of 0.05 M acetate buffer. Two samples were taken for estimation of cAMP concentration using the cAMP 125I-labeled scintillation proximity (non-acetylation) assay from Amersham. For each well, the protein content was determined (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215560) Google Scholar). Binding of [35S]GTPγS to A431 membranes was determined as described previously (18Liebmann C. Schnittler M. Nawrath S. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. Sect. 1991; 207: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained [35S]GTPγS (105 cpm/assay), 1 μM GDP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM captopril, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, and 15 μg of membrane protein in a total volume of 200 μl. Further details are provided in the figure legends. The incubation was started by the addition of the membranes and was carried out in quadruplicates for 45 min at 4°C (equilibrium conditions). The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters under vacuum. The filters were washed with 3 × 2 ml of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 5 mM MgCl2. The filters were dried and counted for radioactivity. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled GTPγS and represents ∼40% of total binding. BK-induced formation of inositol phosphates in A431 cells was determined as described by Tilly et al. (19Tilly B.C. van Paridou P.A. Verlaan I. Wirtz K.W.A. de Laat S.W. Molenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were prelabeled with 4 μCi/ml [3H]inositol for 24 h in inositol-free DMEM. 2 h prior to stimulation, the medium was changed to serum-free DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. Then, the cells were stimulated for 10 min with bradykinin at the concentrations indicated in the presence of 10 mM LiCl2. The reaction was terminated by replacing the medium with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Inositol phosphate-containing extracts were washed four times with 2 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether, neutralized by adding Tris base, diluted to 4 ml with distilled water, and placed on AG 1-X8 columns (200-400 mesh, formate form, Bio-Rad). The columns were subsequently eluted with 2 ml of water and 5 ml of 60 mM ammonium formate and 5 mM sodium tetraborate, followed by 2 ml of 1.0 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid for five times, yielding the inositol phosphate fraction. Radioactivity was measured using a Flow-Scint IV scintillator (Packard Instrument Co.). Antiserum AS 348 was raised against the peptide sequence RMMLRQYELL, corresponding to C-terminal region 385-394 of αs and characterized as described elsewhere (20Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A.

Frank R. Hilz H. Schultz G. Biochem J. 1994; 300: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RC20 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Subconfluent A431 cells were preincubated in serum-free DMEM overnight. Then, the medium was changed to fresh serum-free DMEM, and the cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) at 37°C in the absence or presence of other additions and for various lengths of time as indicated, followed by the preparation of membranes. Immunoprecipitation of Gs proteins was performed according to Laugwitz et al. (22Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For several experiments, AS 348 antibodies were covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose by means of dimethyl pimelimidate. Briefly, 200 μl of AS 348 antiserum (or nonimmune serum as a control) and 200 μl of protein A-Sepharose (12.5 mg of beads) were incubated for 2 h and subsequently washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and twice with 0.2 M sodium borate, pH 9.0. The beads were resuspended in 0.1 M borate buffer. The antibodies were cross-linked to the beads by adding 5.2 mg of dimethyl pimelimidate and mixing for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the beads were washed with 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and the incubation was continued with 0.2 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the beads were washed two times with 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0, and three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The covalently coupled antibodies were stored in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.02% sodium azide at 4°C. Membranes were solubilized in 40 μl of 2% (w/v) SDS for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, 120 μl of precipitating buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, were added. To remove insoluble material, the solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 4°C and 12,000 × g for 10 min. Covalently coupled antiserum AS 348 (20 μl) or nonimmune serum as a control was added to the supernatants, and the samples were incubated at 4°C for 4 h under constant rotation. Thereafter, the beads were pelleted (14,000 × g, 10 s) and washed twice with 1 ml of washing buffer A containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 600 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and twice with 1 ml of washing buffer B containing 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The Sepharose beads were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, heated for 10 min at 100°C, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. The blots were further processed as described previously (22Laugwitz K.-L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Offermanns S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for AS 348 antibodies and according to the instructions of the manufacturer in the case of RC20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Subconfluent A431 cells in 6-well plates (Nunc) were depleted of serum for 24 h. Then, the medium was changed to phosphate-free DMEM medium. After the addition of 0.3 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml of medium, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37°C and 7.5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. After labeling of cells, they were exposed to EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min (or not, as indicated), washed twice with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and solubilized at 4°C in 160 μl/well lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Metabolically labeled Gsα phosphoprotein was immunoprecipitated by protein A-Sepharose-bound anti-αs antiserum AS 348 as described above. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with both buffers A and B, heated with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The αs protein bands were localized in the fixed dried gels by exposure to Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 4 h at −80°C using an intensifying screen. The section of the dried SDS-polyacrylamide gels corresponding to the position of Gsα (∼100-200 cpm) was extracted; the protein was precipitated and hydrolyzed; and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed by two-dimensional separation on thin-layer cellulose plates as described by Boyle et al. (23Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The thin-layer plates were analyzed using a Bio-Rad Model GS250 Molecular Imager and prolonged exposure (3-4 days) on BI imaging screens.

Leupeptin, pepstatin A, and Pefabloc were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Ammonium formate, sodium tetraborate, and Triton X-100 were purchased from SERVA (Heidelberg, Germany). Hoe 140 (D-Arg[Hyp3, Thi5,D-Tic7, Oic8]BK, where Thi is ß-Z-thienylamine, Tic is D-1,2,3,4-tetraisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, and Oic is [3aS, 7aS]octahydroindol-2-carboxylic acid) was kindly provided by Prof. B. Schölkens (Hoechst AG, Frankfurt, Germany). The EGF receptor-specific blocker AG 1478 was purchased from Calbiochem. In intact A431 cells, BK elicited a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP up to ∼140% of the basal level (100%) after 20 min of stimulation (Fig. 1). Half-maximal effects were seen at ∼3 nM BK. When the cells were pretreated with EGF (100 ng/ml, 5 min), the ability of BK to enhance cAMP accumulation was significantly inhibited (Fig. 1, inset, bar D versus bar B), whereas EGF pretreatment itself had no significant effect on the basal cAMP level (inset, bar C versus bar A). In contrast, in EGF-treated A431 cells, BK further stimulated inositol phosphate formation, but at a higher level. This was probably due to additional stimulation of the phospholipase C-γ isoform by EGF (Fig. 2). Thus, EGF pretreatment of A431 cells seems to inhibit the stimulatory BK effect on the cAMP system, but not phosphoinositide breakdown, which are activated via the separate G proteins Gs and Gq, respectively (13Liebmann C.

In these membranes, indeed, the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by NaF (0.1 mM), GTPγS (10 μM), Gpp(NH)p (10 μM), or BK (1 μM) was reduced compared with the effects in membranes prepared from A431 cells not treated with EGF (Fig. 3). The stimulatory effect of forskolin on adenylate cyclase did not significantly differ under either condition (Fig. 3). These results suggest that EGF interferes with activators of adenylate cyclase at the level of the Gsα protein, which is involved in the activation of adenylate cyclase activity by BK in A431 cells (13Liebmann C. Graneß A. Ludwig B. Adomeit A. Boehmer A. Boehmer F.-D. Nürnberg B. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, under our assay conditions, BK caused a concentration-dependent and biphasic increase in [35S]GTPγS binding to A431 membranes. For the first increase, half-maximal and maximal stimulations (up to 155% of control) were observed with ∼0.3 and 1 nM BK, respectively. At higher BK concentrations, [35S]GTPγS binding was continuously reduced, but was followed by a second increase at BK concentrations of ∼30 nM for half-maximal binding and 100 nM for maximal binding (up to 175% of control). The first as well as the second increase in [35S]GTPγS binding induced by BK were completely abolished in the presence of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140, indicating that both effects are mediated via the same BK receptor type (Table I). The reasons for the biphasic curve shape in the BK-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding to A431 membranes are not yet known. It should be noted that the basal binding of [35S]GTPγS to membranes prepared from EGF-treated cells was significantly enhanced (24.0 ± 1.0 fmol/mg of protein; n = 6) compared with that to membranes from untreated cells (18.5 ± 2.2 fmol/mg of protein). To identify that part of the complex pattern of BK-induced [35S]GTPγS binding to A431 membranes that may correspond to the activation of αs subunits, we studied the effect of anti-αs antiserum AS 348 in this assay. AS 348 was raised against the C-terminal region of Gsα, corresponding to amino acids 385-394 (20Spicher K. Kalkbrenner F. Zobel A. Herhammer R. Nürnberg B. Söhling A. Schultz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 906-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and has been successfully used in A431 cells both to detect Gsα on Western blots and to prevent the BK-induced stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity (13Liebmann C. Graneß A. Ludwig B. Adomeit A. Boehmer A. Boehmer F.-D. Nürnberg B. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of A431 membranes with the anti-αs antiserum completely abolished the second phase of [35S]GTPγS binding evoked by BK concentrations higher than 1 nM, whereas the first stimulatory phase employing subnanomolar concentrations of BK was not affected. In the presence of nonimmune serum, both the first and the second BK-induced increases in [35S]GTPγS binding were not significantly altered (Fig. 4A). Compared with the effect of BK in the presence of anti-αs antibodies, a similar curve shape was obtained when the effect of BK on [35S]GTPγS binding was studied in membranes prepared from EGF-pretreated A431 cells (Fig. 4B). In these membranes, an increase in [35S]GTPγS binding at subnanomolar BK concentrations was observed, which was attenuated at concentrations higher than 1 nM BK and completely failed at concentrations higher than ∼3 nM BK. In addition, we studied the effect of the β-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline, which is known to activate Gsα selectively, on [35S]GTPγS binding to A431 membranes. Isoprenaline was found to stimulate [35S]GTPγS binding in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50∼ 20 nM), but completely failed to induce this effect in the presence of the anti-αs antiserum as well as in membranes prepared from EGF-treated A431 cells (Fig. 5).Table I.Effect of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 on the BK-induced biphasic stimulation of [33S]GTPγS binding to A431 membranesAdditionsStimulation of [33S]GTPγS bindingfmol/mg proteinNone (basal)18.5 ± 2.2BK (0.3 nM)27.8 ± 3.2aSignificantly different from BK alone (p < 0.01; Student's t test).+Hoe 14017.7 ± 1.9BK (100 nM)33.5 ± 7.3bSignificantly different from BK alone (p < 0.05; Student's t test).+Hoe 14018.1 ± 1.2a Significantly different from BK alone (p < 0.01; Student's t test).b Significantly different from BK alone (p < 0.05; Student's t test).

A separate series of experiments was performed at pH 7.4 in the presence of insulin or GLU. 15NH3 enrichment exceeded or was equal to that of [15N]citrulline under all conditions except for pH 7.6, when the 15N enrichment in citrulline exceeded that in ammonia. The formation of [15N]citrulline (atom % excess) was increased with higher pH. Flux through phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG) and [15N]urea synthesis were stimulated (p < 0.05) at pH 7.6 or with GLU and decreased (p < 0.05) at pH 6.8. Insulin had no significant effect on flux through PDG or on [15N]urea synthesis. Decreased [15N]urea production at pH 6.8 was associated with depleted aspartate and glutamate levels. Pyruvate attenuated this decrease in the aspartate and glutamate pools and stimulated [15N]urea synthesis. Production of Asp from pyruvate was increased with increasing medium pH. Approximately 80% of Asp was derived from [3-13C]pyruvate regardless of incubation pH or addition of hormone. Furthermore, approximately 20, 40, and 50% of the mitochondrial N-acetylglutamate (NAG) pool was derived from [3-13C]pyruvate at pH 6.8, 7.4, and 7.6, respectively.

The data suggest a correlation between changes in [15N]urea synthesis and alterations in the level and synthesis of [13C]NAG from pyruvate. The current observations suggest that the stimulation of [15N]urea synthesis in acute alkalosis is mediated via increased flux through PDG and subsequent increased utilization of [5-15N] of glutamine for [15N]citrulline synthesis and/or increased synthesis of NAG from glutamate and pyruvate. The opposite may have occurred in acute acidosis. Glucagon, but not insulin, stimulated [15N]urea synthesis via increased flux through PDG and synthesis of NAG.

Doherty P. Adv. Immunol. 1979; 27: 51-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Inappropriate high expression of class I has been associated with autoimmune disease and destruction of normal cells (2Mozes E. Kohn L.D. Hakim F. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with their role in immune surveillance, MHC class I molecules are expressed constitutively on nearly all normal somatic tissues, although the level of expression varies (3Singer D.S. Maguire J. CRC Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 235-257Google Scholar). Thus, the highest levels of class I expression are observed in lymphoid tissues, with lower but varying levels in peripheral tissues. The question of whether MHC class I expression occurs in the central nervous system has been controversial. Original attempts to assess MHC class I in the brain did not detect expression in any cell types. Human neuronal tissue and normal neuronal cell lines do not have detectable levels of class I RNA or protein, suggesting that normally class I genes are not transcribed in these cells (4Drew P. Lonergan M. Goldstein M. Lampson L. Ozato K. McFarlin D. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3300-3310PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lampson L.A. Fisher C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Tissue-specific levels of class I expression are achieved by active transcriptional regulation which is necessary to maintain a normal immune response. Molecular analysis of the extended class I promoter revealed the presence of a series of negative and positive regulatory elements that can be broadly divided into domains governing tissue-specific and hormonal regulation. Thus, a complex regulatory element is responsible for maintaining tissue-specific levels of expression (the tissue-specific element, or TSE) (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It consists of an overlapping enhancer and silencer, extending over 78 bp (−768 to −689 bp). The constitutive activity of the class I promoter in any given tissue is in part determined by the relative activities of the enhancer and silencer in that tissue (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additional constitutive silencers, such as a c-jun element (−420 to −413 bp) also contribute to this regulation (8Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MHC class I promoters also respond to a variety of cytokines (9Lampson L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 512-520PubMed Google Scholar). Activated transcription is regulated by elements broadly centered around an enhancer, enhancer A, located between −180 and −170 bp and an overlapping interferon response sequence (10Drew P. Franzoso G. Becker K. Bours V. Carlson L. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 63: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Drew P. Franzoso G. Carlson L. Biddison W. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2096-2108PubMed Google Scholar). The cognate transcription factors, NFκB and IRF-1, are induced by TNF and interferon, resulting in a concomitant enhancement of expression of class I genes (11Drew P. Franzoso G. Carlson L. Biddison W. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2096-2108PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, distinct regulatory elements determine constitutive and activated transcription of the promoter; their activities are integrated at the basal promoter. The molecular basis for the failure to express basal levels of class I genes in neuronal cells has not been established. Two possible mechanisms can be considered. The generally assumed mechanism is that the class I promoter is simply inactive in neuronal cells and requires activation by cytokine-induced transcription factors (4Drew P. Lonergan M. Goldstein M. Lampson L. Ozato K. McFarlin D. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3300-3310PubMed Google Scholar). However, the alternative possibility is that the class I promoter is constitutively functional but actively repressed by upstream elements. The first suggestion that active repression of class I expression occurs in neuronal cells originally came from studies of transgenic mice constructed with class I promoter constructs. In transgenic mice with a full-length class I promoter region, containing all of the upstream regulatory elements, there was no detectable promoter activity in the brain (12Ehrlich R. Sharrow S. Maguire J. Singer D.S. Immunogenetics. 1989; 30: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, moderate transgene promoter activity was observed in brains of transgenic mice containing a class I promoter truncated to within 500 bp of transcription initiation (13Frels W.I. Bordallo C. Golding H. Rosenberg A. Rudikoff S. Singer D.S. New Biol. 1990; 2: 1024-1033PubMed Google Scholar). It is also now clear that cells of glial origin do express low levels of class I, which can be further induced by cytokines (14Ting J. Takiguchi M. Macchi M. Frelinger J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 14: 87-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of class I in the brains of pigs is readily detectable (12Ehrlich R. Sharrow S. Maguire J. Singer D.S. Immunogenetics. 1989; 30: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, the ability of a class I promoter to function in a human neuroblastoma line was studied. The human neuroblastoma line, CHP-126, which has been used as a model for the study of class I regulation, does not express class I under normal growth conditions (9Lampson L. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 512-520PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the class I promoter is active in CHP-126 cells but that the failure to express class I is the result of active repression. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, gentamicin sulfate (10 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. CHP-126 neuroblastoma cells were kindly provided by Drs. Lois Lampson (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) and Henry McFarland (NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, gentamicin sulfate (10 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. Both cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 7.5% CO2. The 5′ truncation series was derived from the MHC class I promoter, PD1, as described previously by targeted polymerase chain reaction amplification; all constructs terminate at an inserted 3′ HindIII site at +1 (8Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The deletion of the c-jun binding site, to generate the construct of −503XCAT, was described in Howcroft et al. (8Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The construct −503/TSEsilCAT was constructed by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the TSE silencer (−724 to −697 bp) with NdeI ends into the NdeI site within the vector of −503CAT (7Weissman J.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides A1, A2, B1, and B2 (see Table II for DNA sequences) were synthesized with XbaI ends and cloned into the XbaI site of −402CAT. All constructs were sequenced across the insert to determine orientation and to verify the DNA sequence.Table IISequence of the 105 fragment and locations of derivative oligonucleotides Transfection of DNA was using the CaPO4 method (15Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar), with 10 μg of plasmid DNA per 106 cells, in 100 mM dishes. 1 × 106 CHP-126 cells or 7.5 × 105 HeLa cells were plated 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were fed 24 h after transfection and were harvested after an additional 24 h. CAT assay was as described by Gorman et al. (15Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). For HeLa cell transfections, enzymatic activity was normalized to either total protein or to a co-transfected RSV-luciferase control, with equivalent results. For CHP-126 cell transfections, none of the transfection control vectors tested, which use viral promoters, was expressed. Therefore, all transfections were normalized to total protein but were repeated with at least three different plasmid preparations, in at least three independent transfections. Furthermore, all constructs in a deletion series were assayed in parallel in a single experiment, allowing direct comparison of relative promoter efficiency. DNA fragments used in the gel shift assay were a 105-bp NdeI/DdeI fragment spanning −502 to −398 bp, a 254-bp DdeI fragment spanning −890 to −637 bp, and a 140-bp AvaII fragment derived from the 254-bp fragment (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). DNA fragments to be used as probes were prepared by end labeling with [32P]ATP by T4 kinase or by fill-in with [32P]dCTP, using Klenow fragment. Cell extracts were prepared by a modification of the Dignam procedure, as described previously (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For gel shift assays, 3 μg of cell extract was incubated with 1.5-fmol probe, in binding buffer, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol for 30 min. The binding buffer consisted of 10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM MgCl2. All gel shift reactions with the various DNA fragments were under the following conditions: 140-bp fragment was at room temperature in 125 mM NaCl, 105-bp fragment on ice at 100 mM NaCl, and 254-bp fragment at room temperature in 150 mM NaCl. For either cold competition with double-stranded oligonucleotides or antibody supershifts, cell extracts were preincubated with the competitor or antibody for 30 min on ice before addition of radiolabeled probe. Competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides were added at a 104 molar excess. All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Laboratories and used at the recommended concentrations. Gel shift reactions were resolved on 4% acrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE at 160 V for 2.5, 2, and 1.75 h for reactions with the 140-, 105-, and 254-bp fragments, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis of CHP-126 cells was as described previously (16Howcroft T.K. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHP-126 cells were harvested and stained with either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody to human MHC (W6/32), kindly provided by Julie Titus, NIH, or with a control fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody, anti-IAd (Pharmingen, catalog number 0627AD). Cells (10,000) were analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickson FACScan. Under normal growth conditions, CHP-126 cells express neither cell surface MHC class I (Fig. 1) nor class I RNA (data not shown). Introduction into CHP-126 cells of an exogenous full-length class I promoter construct, consisting of 1090 bp of 5′-flanking sequences ligated to the CAT reporter gene, results in levels of CAT activity that are about 100-fold less than observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). The following studies were undertaken to determine whether the class I promoter is inactive in neuronal cells or actively repressed. The 5′-flanking region of the MHC class I promoter contains an array of silencer and enhancer elements that regulate its expression (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Ehrlich R. Maguire J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these regulatory elements functions in CHP-126 cells, 5′ truncation constructs derived from the −1090CAT promoter construct were assessed for their activity when transfected into CHP-126 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, successive truncations between −1090 and −402 bp increasingly activate the class I promoter in CHP-126 neuroblastoma cells, indicative of the presence of multiple silencer elements. Within the series, the −402CAT construct displays maximal promoter activity, achieving a level nearly 10 times greater than the full-length −1090CAT construct. Thus, the class I promoter is constitutively active but repressed by upstream silencer elements. Further truncation of the class I promoter region from −402 to −294 bp results in a marked decrease in promoter activity, demonstrating the presence of an active enhancer element in this region. We have identified this novel enhancer as an element that spans a USF-binding E-box located between −309 and −314 bp 2K. Howcroft, C. Murphy, S. Huber, and D. S. Singer, manuscript in preparation.; it is distinct from the previously described enhancer A (18Miyazaki J. Appella E. Ozato K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9537-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Kimura A. Israel A. LeBail O. Kourilsky P. Cell. 1986; 44: 261-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) which is located further downstream between −170 and −180 bp. Taken together these data demonstrate that in CHP-126 cells, the class I promoter is capable of high levels of activity but is actively repressed. The remaining studies were directed toward the characterization of the silencer elements that repress constitutive class I promoter activity in CHP-126 neuroblastoma cells. We describe four such silencer elements, as summarized in Fig. 2B. Repression of the class I promoter in CHP-126 cells is partially mediated by a silencer element(s) contained between −1090 and −503 bp (Fig. 2). Previous analysis of the class I promoter in this region demonstrated the presence of a complex regulatory element, consisting of overlapping enhancer (−768 to −689 bp) and silencer elements (−724 to −697 bp) (Fig. 2B) (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Levels of class I expression in a variety of tissues were shown to be governed by this element (TSE, see Fig. 2B). To determine whether the silencer component of the TSE also functions in neuronal CHP-126 cells, its effect on class I promoter activity was assessed. Truncation of the class I promoter to −503 resulted in about a 3-fold enhancement of promoter activity in CHP-126 cells (Fig. 2A). Insertion of the isolated silencer segment (−724 to −697 bp) upstream of the truncated −503 promoter construct reduced promoter activity in both CHP-126 and HeLa cells (Table I). Thus, the TSE silencer functions to repress promoter activity in CHP-126 cells, as well as in HeLa cells. The magnitude of this repression is comparable with that mediated by the segment between −503 and −1090 bp, suggesting that the TSE is the major silencer element in this region of the promoter.Table IThe TSE silencer reduces class I promoter activity in CHP-126 and HeLa cellsPromoter constructRelative promoter activityCHP-126HeLa−503CAT11−503/TSEsilCAT0.404 ± 0.0640.304 ± 0.056 Open table in a new tab To characterize the DNA-binding factors in CHP-126 cells that interact with the TSE, gel shift assays were performed using a radiolabeled fragment that spans the entire TSE (254-bp probe in Fig. 2B). CHP-126 extracts generate three bands with this probe (Fig. 3). In contrast, extracts from HeLa cells generate only two of the three bands (Fig. 3). Previous studies of HeLa extracts identified the upper band as associated with the silencer element (thin arrow), whereas the lower band reflects binding to the enhancer moiety (dashed arrow) (7Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To identify the target DNA binding sites of the three complexes in CHP-126 cells, oligonucleotides containing the binding sites for either the enhancer (E9), the enhancer and silencer (S2), or a control (S3) were used as cold competitors (see Fig. 2B). The enhancer-specific oligonucleotide, E9, eliminated only the lower band, indicating that it corresponds to enhancer binding. The two remaining bands were both inhibited by S2 but not by either E9 or the control, mapping their target site to the silencer (Fig. 3). Thus, both CHP-126 and HeLa cell extracts appear to contain common binding factors that interact with the silencer element, as well as the enhancer factor. In addition, there is a CHP-126-specific factor that associates with the silencer element, giving rise to a dominant gel shift band that is not observed with HeLa cell extracts (thick arrow). The factors that associate with the TSE silencer are not known. In gel mobility supershifts with antibodies directed against known transcription factors, none of the following antibodies had any effect on the complexes: SAP, SRF, YY1, E2F, c-fos, c-jun, n-myc, p53, and NF-κBp65 (data not shown). This result was not surprising, since the DNA sequences of the silencer and enhancer do not correspond to the binding of any known mammalian transcription factor. Surprisingly, antibodies directed against ATF2, Max, and TAFII250 were able to shift the TSE silencer complexes in both HeLa and CHP-126 extracts (data not shown); none of these factors is known to bind the silencer sequence or has been previously associated with silencer activity. Taken together, these data indicate that one of the silencers regulating MHC class I promoter activity in neuronal CHP-126 cells is the silencer component of the tissue-specific element, TSE, which has previously been demonstrated to span 28 bp and to consist of a discontinuous binding site of 10 and 8 bp, separated by 10 bp.(7). These studies also provide further evidence of the role of the TSE in regulating tissue-specific expression of class I. As shown in Fig. 2A, removal of DNA sequences between −503 and −402 bp results in increased activity of the downstream promoter, indicating that this DNA segment contains additional silencer elements. In the following experiments, we demonstrate that three silencer elements are contained in this region. Two of these silencers are specific for CHP-126 cells. The third silencer element is a c-jun binding site located between −420 and −413 bp that has been shown previously to also function in fibroblasts (8Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). That this latter element regulates the class I promoter in CHP-126 cells was shown by deleting the c-jun binding site from the −503 construct to generate −503X. This deletion resulted in markedly increased promoter activity, demonstrating that the c-jun site functions as a silencer in CHP-126 cells (Fig. 4A). Although the −503XCAT construct was more active than the parental −503CAT construct, it was still significantly less active than the −402CAT construct. These data suggest that in the DNA segment between −402 and −503 bp there are additional silencer elements that function in CHP-126 cells. To identify these additional silencers, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ (A1, A2) and central (B1) segments of the region between −402 and −503 bp (see Fig. 2B) were cloned upstream of the −402CAT construct, and their effects on promoter activity were examined (Fig. 5). In CHP-126 cells, all of the constructs (402A1, 402A2, and 402B1) had lower promoter activity than the parental −402CAT construct (Fig. 5A); this effect was independent of orientation of the DNA fragment (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the interval between −402 and −503 bp contains three functional silencer elements Sil-A, Sil-B, and the c-jun silencer (summarized in Fig. 2B and Table II). Whereas all three elements function as silencers in CHP-126 cells, they differ in their activities in HeLa cells (Fig. 4B and 5B). In HeLa cells, deletion of the c-jun binding site in the −503XCAT construct rendered the promoter more active than in the parental −503CAT construct, demonstrating its function as a strong silencer. However, the −503XCAT construct was also significantly more active than the −402CAT construct, suggesting that the segment between −503 and −402 contains an enhancer element whose activity is normally obscured by the c-jun silencer (Fig. 4B). This enhancer is identified as Sil-B, since introduction of oligonucleotide B1 upstream of −402CAT increases promoter activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the Sil-A element (402A1 and 402A2) had no significant effect on promoter activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 5B). These effects were also independent of orientation (data not shown). Taken together, these studies defined three types of elements, the c-jun binding site that acts as a repressor in both cell types, the Sil-A element that functions as a silencer in CHP-126 but not HeLa cells, and the Sil-B element that functions as a silencer in CHP-126 cells but as an enhancer in HeLa cells. The above studies mapped the CHP-126-specific silencer, Sil-A, to a 25-bp segment (−503 to −479 bp) and the tissue-specific enhancer/silencer Sil-B to a 28-bp segment (−440 to −433 bp). To determine whether any protein complexes associate with these functionally defined regions, a radiolabeled 105-bp DNA fragment, extending from −399 to −503 bp (see Fig. 2B), was used as a probe in gel shift assays with cell extracts from either CHP-126 cells or HeLa cells (Fig. 6A). Both extracts formed a low mobility complex that was competed by an unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′ silencer (A4), suggesting that both cell types contain factors that specifically interact with this sequence (thin arrow, Fig. 6A). Fine mapping of this common complex using a series of oligonucleotide competitors localized the recognition sequence to the sequence ATGGATTAT (summarized in Table II, lines A1 through A7). To identify the protein components of these complexes, gel supershift assays were performed with a variety of antibodies to known transcription factors (Fig. 6B). Only antibodies to Max and ATF2 affected complex formation, and only the low mobility complex common to the CHP-126 and HeLa extracts was affected. Thus, although the Sil-A element functioned as a silencer in CHP-126 but not in HeLa cells, it formed common complexes in both extracts. It is likely that the complexes differ either (a) by the presence of additional factors or (b) in post-translational modifications of the component factors. CHP-126 extracts also generated a novel complex with the 105-bp probe (thick arrow, Fig. 6A). By competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides, this complex mapped to the central enhancer/silencer region (B3 in Fig. 6A, summarized in Table II, lines B1 through B7) to the sequence CTATTATTTCTAGTATA. A core sequence of TATTATTT was shown to be necessary for stable complex formation in gel shift, since an oligonucleotide (B2) mutated in this sequence was unable to compete the complex. However, this core sequence is not sufficient for complex formation, since an oligonucleotide consisting only of the core sequence (B4) did not compete, whereas an extended oligonucleotide (B5) did (Table II). Consistent with the conclusion that the functional element consists of an extended sequence, the mutated B2 oligonucleotide still functioned as an enhancer/silencer when placed upstream of the −402CAT construct (Fig. 5, 402B2). This complex was not supershifted by any of the antibodies to known transcription factors (Fig. 6B and data not shown). Furthermore, a scan of the existing transcription factor data bases did not reveal similarities between either Sil-A or Sil-B and known binding sites of characterized transcription factors. Although the recognition sequences of Sil-A and Sil-B share a common core of ATTAT (see Table II), they do not bind common factors. Thus, an oligonucleotide that specifically competes complexes associated with Sil-A (A4) does not affect Sil-B complexes. Conversely, oligonucleotide B3 competes Sil-B, but not Sil-A, complexes (Fig. 6A, Table II). We have previously noted that c-jun in L cell extracts does not form complexes with the 105-bp segment that are detected by the gel shift assay (8Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, neither the HeLa nor the CHP-126 extracts generated complexes with the c-jun binding site, as evidenced by the finding that an oligonucleotide spanning the c-jun binding site (B7) did not compete any of the complexes (Fig. 6A). Analysis of the factors that bind to the silencer elements by antibody supershift revealed that anti-Max and anti-ATF2 interacted both with complexes formed with the upstream TSE and with the downstream silencer Sil-A (Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This raised the possibility that common factors might associate with the various silencers. To test this, complexes formed with the radiolabeled 105-bp probe containing Sil-A and Sil-B were competed with the unlabeled 140-bp fragment containing the upstream tissue-specific element (see Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 7 (left), the upstream TSE effectively competed both the upper Sil-A complex as well as the lower Sil-B complex associated with the radiolabeled 105-bp fragment. In contrast, an unrelated fragment derived from a downstream 178-bp DNA segment (−399 to −222 bp) did not compete either (Fig. 7, left). To further delineate the common binding site(s), oligonucleotides derived from the upstream TSE silencer were used as cold competitors with the labeled 105-bp probe (Fig. 2B and 7A, right). The oligonucleotide S2, which contains the TSE silencer sequence, was able to compete both the silencer bands associated with the downstream 105-bp fragment (Sil-A and Sil-B). In contrast, neither oligonucleotide E9, which is specific for enhancer factors, nor S3, an irrelevant control, inhibited complex formation with the 105-bp probe. These data indicated that common factors bound to the upstream TSE silencer and to the downstream silencers Sil-A and Sil-B. Sil-A and Sil-B bind distinct factors, as evidenced by the finding that they do not compete with one another for complex formation (see Fig. 5A and Table II, where oligonucleotide A4 competed only the upper complex and B3 competed only the lower complex). However, the TSE inhibited both complexes (Fig. 7A), indicating that the upstream TSE silencer contains two distinct binding sites for silencer factors, corresponding to Sil-A and Sil-B factors. To confirm this conclusion, gel shift competition assays were performed with a radiolabeled 140-bp probe containing the TSE in the presence of oligonucleotides A4 and B5 derived from the two downstream silencers, Sil-A and Sil-B, respectively (Fig. 7B). As predicted, each of the downstream silencer oligonucleotides inhibited only one of the two silencer-associated complexes. The B5 oligonucleotide, which corresponds to the CHP-specific downstream silencer, Sil-B, competed the CHP-specific complex formed by the upstream silencer (thick arrow). The A4 oligonucleotide, which corresponds to Sil-A, competed the common complex formed by the upstream silencer (thin arrow). Alignment of these oligonucleotide sequences with the TSE does not reveal any homologies that clearly define common binding sites. Although all three sequences contain the sequence motif TTATT, this sequence also occurs in the oligonucleotide E9 which fails to compete any of the silencer complexes. These findings suggest the possibility that distinct factors directly bind the DNA sequences and that the common factors associate indirectly, through protein interactions. The human neuroblastoma cell line, CHP-126, does not normally express either class I RNA or cell surface protein (5Lampson L.A. Fisher C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6476-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Lavi E. Suzumura A. Murasko D.M. Murray E.M. Silverberg D.H. Weiss S.R. J. Neuroimmunol. 1988; 18: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have demonstrated that the absence of class I gene expression is due to active repression of a functional class I promoter. This repression is accomplished through the additive effects of a series of upstream silencer elements. Removal of these silencers reveals not only an active promoter element but also the presence of a functioning enhancer. The four silencers responsible for repression have been characterized and shown to have distinct sequences, binding factors, and patterns of function. One, located between −724 and −697 bp, functions in all cell types as a constituent of a tissue-specific regulatory element that serves to maintain tissue-appropriate levels of class I expression (17Ehrlich R. Maguire J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A second element, located between −309 and −314 bp, is also a constitutive silencer in all cell types and is regulated by c-jun (8Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two additional elements (Sil-A and Sil-B in Fig. 2B), both located between −402 and −503 bp, function as silencers in CHP-126 cells but not in HeLa cells. The downstream silencers display differing functions in CHP-126 cells and HeLa cells. In particular, Sil-B is a silencer element in CHP-126 cells but an enhancer in HeLa cells. Although it functions in HeLa cells, no specific DNA-binding protein complex could be identified. In contrast, Sil-A, which forms indistinguishable protein complexes in CHP-126 and HeLa extracts, functions as a silencer in CHP-126 cells but has no detectable function in HeLa cells. The relationship between the various complexes detected by gel shift and the functioning of the elements remains to be determined. One possibility is that post-translational modifications determine function but not binding. Alternatively, binding of proteins may occur in cell extracts that do not occur in vivo. The silencer elements coordinately repress constitutive class I transcription through a complex set of interactions. The two CHP-126-specific silencer sequences, Sil-A and Sil-B, do not bind factors in common, as demonstrated by their failure to compete complexes formed by the other in gel shift assays (Fig. 6A). But each does bind factors in common with the tissue-specific upstream silencer (TSE in Fig. 2B) (Fig. 7). The helix-loop-helix transcription factor Max was identified as a component of the CHP-126-specific complexes associated with Sil-B and TSE. Since Max most often binds DNA in association with other helix-loop-helix factors, it is likely that each of these complexes contains additional factors. In addition, since the DNA sequences of the upstream and downstream silencers have little homology to one another, it is also probable that the associated complexes are distinct from one another. Because neither element contains a canonical E-box motif (CACGTG), which is the recognition site for Max (20Ferre-D'Amare A. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), it is possible that Max is not binding the DNA sequence directly but rather associates with proteins that are. Similarly, the ATF-2 transcription factor is a component of the silencer complexes common to CHP-126 and HeLa cell extracts. The compositions of these complexes are also likely to differ. It is intriguing to consider the possibility that these factors link the complexes bound to the upstream and downstream silencers, to create higher-order interactions that regulate the promoter in concert. Similar structures, termed enhanceosomes, have recently been described and postulated to allow integrated regulation of the downstream promoter (21Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Further characterization of these complexes and their mode of action will require biochemical purification and analysis. In CHP-126 cells, the class I promoter is regulated not only by the series of silencers located between −402 bp and −1090 bp but also by an enhancer that maps between −309 and −416 bp. This enhancer is critical for constitutive promoter function in CHP-126 cells, since its removal results in a complete loss of promoter activity. This is in contrast to the situation in HeLa cells, where the enhancer is not required for class I promoter activity, since promoter constructs with as little as 50 bp of 5′ sequence are functional (16Howcroft T.K. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that class I promoter activity is simultaneously negatively and positively regulated in CHP-126 cells. These data also resolve an apparent discrepancy with earlier studies, which failed to detect either constitutive class I promoter activity or promoter activity of class I promoter/CAT constructs transfected into CHP-126 cells (4Drew P. Lonergan M. Goldstein M. Lampson L. Ozato K. McFarlin D. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3300-3310PubMed Google Scholar). However, in those studies, the promoter constructs used were either shorter than 300 bp or longer than 1.4 kilobase pairs and would thus either lack an enhancer or encompass silencer elements, respectively. The transcription factor, NFκB, is not constitutively expressed in CHP-126 cells. However, it is induced following treatment of the cells with TNF and binds to an enhancer in the class I promoter, enhancer A (see Fig. 2) (10Drew P. Franzoso G. Becker K. Bours V. Carlson L. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 63: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Drew P. Franzoso G. Carlson L. Biddison W. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2096-2108PubMed Google Scholar). This binding has been correlated with cytokine-mediated induction of class I transcription. The present studies demonstrate that although NFkB may be necessary for cytokine-induced class I expression, it is not necessary for constitutive expression. An upstream enhancer is able to activate the promoter in the absence of either NFκB or IRF-1. The present studies clearly distinguish for the first time the requirements for constitutive and activated transcription. Although many human neuroblastomas do not express class I, many murine neuroblastomas express significant levels (14Ting J. Takiguchi M. Macchi M. Frelinger J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1987; 14: 87-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The present findings suggest that those lines that express class I may have lost the constitutive active repression mechanism, revealing the presence of an active promoter. Inhibition of the NF-κB component p50 by the oncogene n-myc has been proposed to cause the deficiency of class I expression in the rat B104 neuroblastoma line (22van't Veer L. Beijersbergen R. Bernards R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism is unlikely to account for the failure of human CHP-126 cells to express class I, since they are devoid of p50 (10Drew P. Franzoso G. Becker K. Bours V. Carlson L. Siebenlist U. Ozato K. J. Neuroimmunol. 1995; 63: 157-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); p50 is only induced after activation of the CHP-126 neuroblastomas by cytokines (or TNF), suggesting that B104 represents a cell line that was transformed after activation. This latter example appears to reflect a viral strategy for avoiding immune surveillance rather than a normal regulatory mechanism. The importance of minimizing class I expression in the normal neuronal cell is likely due to the necessity of avoiding deleterious inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Furthermore, induction of class I in neuronal cells is associated with reduced bioelectrical activity (23Neumann H. Cavalie A. Jenne D.E. Wekerle H. Science. 1996; 269: 549-552Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is equally important that the neuronal cells be able to quickly identify intracellular pathogens and flag the immune system, which would require a rapid induction of class I. One way to achieve both needs would be to maintain an active class I promoter, whose expression is normally repressed but readily inducible in response to appropriate stimuli. The present studies have demonstrated the existence of such an active repression mechanism and have identified a series of both general and CHP-126-specific silencers that effect it.

https://openalex.org/W1996538304,"The isozyme form of plant eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF(iso)4F) contains two subunits: p28, a cap-binding protein, and p86. To identify the functional domains of p86, truncations of the p86 cDNA were made, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The deletion mutants were tested for the ability to bind the p28 subunit by two methods. In addition, these deletion mutants were evaluated in vitro by the ability to catalyze eIF4A and RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and to support polypeptide synthesis. The loss of the ability to bind p28 occurs within the first 90 amino acids of the N terminus and abrogates the ability of p86 to participate in translation initiation and bind to eIF4A, but does not affect ATP hydrolysis. Up to 299 amino acid residues from the C terminus of p86 must be deleted before an effect is observed on the ATP hydrolysis activity. Thus, the p28 binding and ATP hydrolysis activities appear to lie on two separate domains and are functionally uncoupled. In addition, at least a portion of the eIF4A binding domain appears to be in close proximity to the p28 binding domain and is also uncoupled from the ATP hydrolysis activity. The isozyme form of plant eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF(iso)4F) contains two subunits: p28, a cap-binding protein, and p86. To identify the functional domains of p86, truncations of the p86 cDNA were made, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The deletion mutants were tested for the ability to bind the p28 subunit by two methods. In addition, these deletion mutants were evaluated in vitro by the ability to catalyze eIF4A and RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and to support polypeptide synthesis.

The initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis is a complicated process and involves several initiation factors (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar and 2Browning K.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of binding the mRNA and bringing it to the 40 S subunits is unknown, and several models have been proposed (3Merrick W.C. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Rhoads R.E. Joshi B. Minich W.B. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Sonenberg N.

One of the initiation factors, eIF4F, 1The abbreviations used are: eIFeukaryotic initiation factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisAAamino acid(s). contains two subunits, eIF4E, a cap-binding protein and eIF4G, a protein of largely unknown function. Another initiation factor, eIF4A, is frequently found associated with eIF4F depending upon the method of purification (6Etchison D. Milburn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 76: 15-25Google Scholar, 7Webster C. Gaut R.L. Browning K.S. Ravel J.M. Roberts J.K.M. J. Biol.

The subunits of mammalian eIF4F are believed to be involved in regulation of protein synthesis. The large subunit of mammalian eIF4F, eIF4G, is cleaved by picornaviral proteases, severely affecting the ability of the cell to translate capped mRNAs (8Sonenberg N. New Biol. 1990; 2: 402-409PubMed Google Scholar). These proteases cleave mammalian eIF4G into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments (9Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 10Ohlmann T. Rau M. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment binds the mammalian cap-binding protein, and the C-terminal fragment binds eIF4A and eIF3 (9Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The C-terminal fragment alone has been shown to promote cap-independent translation of mRNAs containing an internal ribosome binding site (10Ohlmann T. Rau M. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of mammalian eIF4E is believed also to be involved in regulation of initiation. However, there is no clear difference in the ability of phosphorylated eIF4E to either bind m7GTP-Sepharose or interact with eIF4G (1Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In studies where the phosphorylation state of eIF4E was altered, there were also changes in the phosphorylation state of other initiation factors (11Morley S.J. Pain V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1751-1760PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bu X. Haas D.W. Hagedorn C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4975-4978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Manzella J.M. Rychlik W.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10611-10616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the exact mechanism of this regulation remains to be elucidated. Recently, another protein was identified that binds to mammalian eIF4E. This protein, eIF4E-BP1 or PHAS-I, is phosphorylated in response to insulin in mammalian cells (15Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 16Pause A. Belsham G.J. Gingras A.-C. Donzé O. Lin T.-A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1994; 371: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). There is now considerable evidence that this protein sequesters eIF4E and prevents eIF4E from interacting with eIF4G (17Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated form of eIF4E-BP1 is unable to bind eIF4E and releases any bound eIF4E (15Lin T.-A. Kong X. Haystead T.A.J. Pause A. Belsham G. Sonenberg N. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Several kinases in the signal transduction pathways have been implicated in this process (18Lin T.A. Kong X. Saltiel A.R. Blackshear P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18531-18538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Wheat translation initiation factor eIF(iso)4F, the isozyme form of eIF4F, contains two subunits, p28 and p86 which are antigenically distinct from the two eIF4F subunits isolated from wheat germ (19Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isozyme form of eIF4F appears to be unique to higher plants and has not been identified as yet in other eukaryotes. The protein has been observed in wheat, maize, and cauliflower (20Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10096-10100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cDNA expressed sequence tags for the subunits have been identified for rice and Arabidopsis thaliana. 2K. Browning, unpublished observation.The p28 subunit is a cap-binding protein (19Browning K.S. Lax S.R. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11228-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous to mammalian eIF4G, no specific function(s) has been assigned to p86. The p86 subunit is considerably smaller (86 kDa) than the predicted molecular mass for human eIF4G (154 kDa (21Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or yeast eIF4G (104 kDa (22Goyer C. Altmann M. Lee H.S. Blanc A. Deshmukh M. Woolford Jr., J.L. Trachsel H. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4860-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)). There are seven regions of similarity between p86 and mammalian and/or yeast eIF4G (see Fig. 1A). eIF(iso)4F has the same functional properties as wheat germ eIF4F: 1) it substitutes for eIF4F in an in vitro translation system deficient in eIF4F; 2) it substitutes for eIF4F in supporting the binding of mRNA to 40 S ribosomal subunits; 3) it exhibits RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence of eIF4A; and 4) it exhibits ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity in the presence of eIF4A (19Browning K.S.

Plant eIF(iso)4F carries out the same functions as eIF4F, but with a large subunit approximately one-half the size of mammalian eIF4G. The smaller size and the ability to express a functionally active protein in Escherichia coli for p86, makes it ideal for identifying the functional domains of this protein. In the present paper, we initiate mapping of the domains of the p86 subunit to better understand its interaction with the cap-binding protein and other initiation factors. Truncation mutations of p86 were made and tested for the ability to bind to p28, to participate in ATP hydrolysis, to support polypeptide synthesis, and to interact with eIF4A.

Construction of the plasmid for expression of wild-type p86 (pET3D-p86) was as described previously (28van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotide primers introducing an NcoI site at the desired N-terminal end and a BamHI site at the desired C-terminal end were used to amplify the cDNA (see Table I). The amplified DNA products were restricted, purified, and ligated into NcoI/BamHI-cut pET3d (Novagen) as described previously (28van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except the clarified cell extract was applied to a 2-ml phosphocellulose column (Whatman P11) equilibrated in buffer B (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 100 mM KCl. Expressed protein was eluted from the column with a 20-ml linear gradient from 100 to 250 mM KCl in buffer B (wild-type, N-52, N-90, N-136, N-186) or from 150 to 400 mM KCl in buffer B (C-462, C-489, C-511). To remove a nonspecific E. coli ATP hydrolysis activity, 0.5 mg of the phosphocellulose column eluate was dialyzed into buffer B-100 and applied to a 1-ml DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE52) equilibrated in buffer B-100. The flow-through fractions (500 μl) contained the p86 mutants, and the E. coli ATP hydrolysis activity was retained on the column. The flow-through fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled. Each p86 mutant (3000 pmol) was combined with purified p28 subunit (2000 pmol) and applied to a 1-ml m7GTP-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in buffer B-100 (28van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex was eluted with 0.1 mM m7GTP in buffer B-100. Fractions (500 μl) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Polypeptide synthesis was carried out as described previously (20Browning K.S. Webster C. Roberts J.K.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol.

The values reported are the average of three experiments. The standard ATP hydrolysis reaction was carried out as described previously (24Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contained 1 μg of poly(U), 5 μg of purified wheat germ eIF4A, and 20 pmol of p86 or mutant protein (DEAE flow-through). The ATP hydrolysis in this assay is dependent upon the addition of both eIF4A and poly(U) (24Lax S.R. Browning K.S. Maia D.M. Ravel J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15632-15636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The values reported are the average of six experiments. Matchmaker 2-hybrid system vectors (pGBT-9 and pGAD-424) and control plasmids (pLAM5′, pTD1, and pVA3) were from Clontech. Two oligonucleotides that introduced an EcoRI site directly in front of the initiator AUG of p86 and a BamHI site directly 3′ to the stop codon were used to amplify the coding region of the plasmid containing the p86 cDNA. The amplified DNA product was cloned into EcoRI/BamHI site of pGTB-9 (binding domain) by standard methods. Similar methods were used to place the p28 and eIF4A coding regions into yeast two-hybrid vectors. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The pGBT-9 plasmid was altered to include an NcoI site between the EcoRI and BamHI polylinker sites to allow direct subcloning of the p86 mutant cDNAs and eIF4A cDNA. The resulting vector was termed pGBT-9/N. Construction of the vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing across the polylinker site on both strands. The p86 deletion mutants were excised from the pET3d expression vector with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into pGBT-9/N restricted with NcoI and BamHI by standard procedures. Sets of two plasmids were co-transformed as indicated (see Table III., Table IV.) into yeast strain SFY-526 as per the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Interaction in Table III was scored by the appearance of blue color using the β-galactosidase filter assay as per the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech).

Open table in a new tab A series of deletion mutants from the N terminus and C terminus of p86 were made to identify the functional domains. The maximum deletions, N-186 and C-462, were designed to include only the region of maximum similarity (approximately amino acids 204 to 432, blocks 2-6 in Fig. 1A) to mammalian and yeast eIF4G (28van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within this region are blocks that range from 31-50% similarity to mammalian and/or yeast eIF4G (see Fig. 1A). The conservation of these blocks suggest that they are involved in the function of the protein: interaction with other components of the translational machinery or enzymatic activity. There are three sets of blocks (3, 4, and 7) that have similarity to mammalian eIF4G or yeast eIF4G, but not both. The N-terminal end of p86 is much shorter than either mammalian or yeast eIF4G, suggesting that these regions of mammalian and yeast eIF4G may be involved in regulation rather than function. The C terminus of yeast eIF4G is much shorter than mammalian eIF4G or p86 (see Fig. 1A). There is a block of similarity (Fig. 1A, block 7) shared by p86 and mammalian eIF4G that occurs after the yeast eIF4G terminates. The function of this region is unknown at this time; however, this region of p86 is implicated in the binding of microtubules (32Bokros C.L. Hugdahl J.D. Kim H.-H. Hanesworth V.R. Van Heerden A.

A schematic of the N-terminal and C-terminal truncation mutants of the p86 subunit of eIF(iso)4F is shown in Fig. 1B. These mutants were expressed in E. coli and purified. An SDS-PAGE of the mutant forms is shown in Fig. 2. There are some minor degradation products in the protein preparations, particularly of the C-terminal truncation mutants. The presence of these products suggests that certain regions in the C terminus are probably more exposed in the truncation mutants and are more susceptible to protease digestion. The ability of the mutants to form a complex with p28 was measured by retention of the mutant protein on a m7GTP-Sepharose column. As shown in Table II, N-terminal deletions past residue 52 (N-90, N-136, N-186) were unable to form a complex with p28. The C-terminal deletions were all able to form a complex with p28.Table II.Polypeptide synthesis, ATP hydrolysis, and p28 binding activities of p86 deletion mutantsProtein addedPolypeptide synthesisATP hydrolysisBinding of p28 (Yes/No)aThe ability of the p86 mutants to bind to p28 was measured by the presence of the p86 mutant in the m7GTP eluant on an SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.”% control% controlWild-type100b30 pmol of [14C]leucine incorporated.

Open table in a new tab The yeast two-hybrid system was used to confirm the p28-p86 interactions. A very intense blue color was obtained when wild-type p86 (binding domain vector) and p28 (activation domain vector), as well as the positive controls (pVA3 and pTD1), were co-transformed into yeast cells (see Table III). The negative controls or the plasmids alone (p86, p28, pLAM5′, pTD1, or pVA3) gave no color (see Table III). Combinations of p86 with pTD1 or pVA3 or combinations of p28 with pTD1 or pVA3 were also negative. When the p28 was placed into the binding domain vector and p86 into the activation domain vector, an interaction of similar intensity was observed. These results show that the regions of the two molecules that interact are not impaired by the addition of any vector-specific sequences. A new binding domain vector (pGBT-9/N) was constructed to facilitate the subcloning of the p86 truncation mutations from pET3d into the binding domain vector of the yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Table III, results identical to the retention on m7GTP-Sepharose were obtained for p28 binding by p86 deletions mutants with the two-hybrid system. Interaction of p28 was no longer possible when mutants truncated past residue 52 were used, whereas all the C-terminal mutants were able to interact with p28. These data indicate that the site of interaction of p86 with p28 resides between residues 52 and 90. This result is consistent with the observation that the sequence from amino acids 62 to 73 in p86 (block 1 in Fig. 1A) contains a motif identified as necessary for the binding of the mammalian eIF4E to mammalian eIF4G or eIF4E-BP1 (33Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified mutants were assayed for the ability to support polypeptide synthesis in the presence of p28 in an eIF(iso)4F-dependent system from wheat germ (28van Heerden A. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17454-17457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, N-terminal deletions past amino acid 52 lost the ability to support translation in the assay system. The N-52 mutant consistently showed a slightly higher activity in this assay system. The removal of these amino acids may be changing the conformation of the protein such that certain domains are more exposed and increase the activity of the complex. The mutants that were unable to form a complex with p28 (N-90, N-136, and N-186) were also unable to support translation in vitro. These results suggest that a complex of p86 and p28 is necessary to initiate translation. As shown in Table II, truncations from the C-terminal end of the p86 subunit did not adversely affect the ability of p86 to support translation up to residue 462 (C-462). The ATP hydrolysis activity of p86 is both RNA-dependent and eIF4A-dependent, but does not require the presence of p28 (data not shown). None of the truncations from the amino terminus affected the ATP hydrolysis activity of p86 (see Table II). However, the C-489 mutant, while still supporting translation as well as wild-type, showed ATP hydrolysis activity at 58% of wild-type. C-terminal truncations to C-462 almost completely abrogated ATP hydrolysis activity (to 14% of wild-type) and seriously reduced the ability of the p86 mutant to support translation (36% of wild-type). This suggests that at least a portion of the ATP hydrolysis domain on p86 is located in a central region of the protein, around residues 450-500, and a partial loss of ATP hydrolysis activity is tolerated before protein synthesis activity is affected. Consequently, this region may define the site(s) or portions of the site(s) of interaction of RNA, ATP, and/or eIF4A with p86 during the initiation process. This region is very close to the start of the conserved blocks (Fig. 1A, block 6) between p86 and mammalian and yeast 4G, suggesting that the interactions of eIF4G, RNA, ATP, and/or eIF4A may share a common motif. The interaction of the truncation mutants with eIF4A was examined in the two-hybrid system. The interaction of the p86 truncation mutants with eIF4A or p28 was quantitated using a liquid assay for β-galactosidase as shown in Table IV. Interestingly, differences in the relative binding of the p86 mutants to p28 were observed in the quantitative two-hybrid assay that were not obvious in the filter assay. The C-terminal deletion mutants have an approximately 2-fold higher interaction with p28 and suggest that the C terminus of p86 may hinder binding of p28 at the N terminus. Surprisingly, the N-terminal mutants do not interact with eIF4A, and the C-terminal truncation mutants have a slightly increased level of interaction. These results suggest that the N terminus of p86 interacts with eIF4A in a manner that is not accurately reflected in the ATP hydrolysis assay. Interaction of eIF4A with p28 was not observed in either the qualitative or quantitative two-hybrid assays. These results would indicate that at least part of the site of interaction of eIF4A with p86 is in close proximity to the p28 binding site. If the quantitative two-hybrid data are taken as a reflection of the affinity of the interaction of two proteins, then the interaction of eIF4A with p86 is at least 5-fold less than with p28. Clearly, further investigation is needed to understand the interactions of these three proteins and to quantitate the affinity of interaction. Considering both the ATP hydrolysis and the p28 binding data together indicates that these functions lie on separate domains on p86 and can be uncoupled. The binding of p28 is not required for ATP hydrolysis activity, and, conversely, ATP hydrolysis activity is not required for p28 binding. Furthermore, ATP hydrolysis activity and the eIF4A binding appear to lie on separate domains as well. It will be interesting to contrast the ATP hydrolysis domain and eIF4A binding domain with the domain(s) for RNA binding and/or RNA helicase activity. Both the p86 and p28 in the presence of eIF4A and ATP are required for RNA helicase activity (34Sha M. Wang Y.H. Xiang T. Van Heerden A. Browning K.S. Goss D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29904-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Experiments are in progress to determine which portions of p86 are involved in RNA helicase activity. We have demonstrated that the site of interaction of the cap-binding protein (p28) with its large subunit (p86) resides within a region defined by residues 52-90 that contains a motif shown to be required for binding of mammalian eIF4E to mammalian eIF4G (9Lamphear B.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that this region also appears to be required for interaction with eIF4A. This is a novel observation that the N terminus of p86 may also be involved in the binding of eIF4A. The C-terminal portion of mammalian eIF4G has been shown to interact with mammalian eIF4A (9Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The ability of p86 to bind the p28 subunit is absolutely required for in vitro protein synthesis activity. However, the ability of the p86 subunit to bind p28 or eIF4A appears to be uncoupled from its ability to stimulate RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis in the presence of eIF4A. We have also demonstrated that the use of the yeast two-hybrid system will be a very powerful tool in elucidating the complex interactions of the subunits of eIF(iso)4F with each other and with other initiation factors."
https://openalex.org/W2091846850,"Five plastocyanin-deficient mutants were identified from a population of UV-mutagenized Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that four mutants represented alleles at the PCY1 locus (pcy1-2, pcy1-3, pcy1-4, and pcy1-5). Sequence analysis confirmed that two strains, pcy1-2 and pcy1-3, carry a frameshift (−1) and a nonsense mutation, respectively, while strains pcy1-4 and pcy1-5 synthesize an extended protein as a result of read-through mutations at the stop codon. The C-terminal extension does not affect synthesis or processing of the pre-proteins, but the polypeptides are rapidly degraded after the second (lumenal) processing event. The frameshift mutation in pcy1-2 results in loss of Pcy1 mRNA, as noted previously for strain ac208 (pcy1-1), but the abundance of Pcy1 mRNA in strain pcy1-3, which carries a nonsense mutation at codon 26, is unaffected relative to wild-type cells. The decreased abundance of frameshifted Pcy1 mRNA is attributed to increased degradation rather than decreased synthesis, since the mRNAs can be stabilized by treatment of cells with cycloheximide or anisomycin. The fifth strain has a wild-type plastocyanin-encoding gene, but the strain accumulates apoplastocyanin at the expense of holoplastocyanin. We suggest that the mutation identifies a new locus (PCY2) whose function is required for normal holoplastocyanin accumulation. Like ac208 (pcy1-1), several of the new mutants were suppressed spontaneously owing to accumulation of cytochrome c6 (a functional substitute for plastocyanin). The suppressor mutation(s) displayed Mendelian inheritance and segregated independently from the PCY1 locus, which confirms that regulation of Cyc6 expression is not tightly linked to plastocyanin function.

Plastocyanin is a copper-binding protein whose function in the Z-scheme of photosynthesis is the catalysis of electron transfer from cytochrome f in the b6f complex to P700+ in Photosystem I. The protein is an eight-stranded, anti-parallel β-barrel (∼100 residues) and is abundant in the lumenal compartment of the chloroplast (several million molecules per cell). Its single copper atom, liganded by a cysteinyl thiolate, a methionyl sulfur, and two imidazole nitrogens of histidines, is at the active site of the protein and is responsible for its redox function (reviewed in Ref. 2Redinbo M.R. Yeates T.O. Merchant S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The metal also serves to stabilize the folded conformation of the protein (3Koide S. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12299-12310Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Other structural features of the protein (whose functional importance has been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis) include a pronounced negatively charged patch and a flat hydrophobic surface. The plastocyanin biosynthetic pathway has served as a model for studies of nuclear gene expression in plants (reviewed in Ref. 4Thompson W.F. White M.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 423-466Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar; see also Refs. 5Nielsen P.S. Gausing K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Pwee K.H. Gray J.C.

In eukaryotic cells, plastocyanin is encoded by a single nuclear gene (PetE/Pcy1). 1In this work, we name the Chlamydomonas gene encoding pre-apoplastocyanin, Pcy1. This corresponds to the petE gene of cyanobacteria and the nucleus-encoded PetE gene of plants. We suggest the use of the mnemonic PCY for loci affecting plastocyanin biosynthesis and function. The ac208 locus (see Ref. 1Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar) is therefore renamed pcy1-1, and the corresponding wild-type locus is PCY1. The new alleles described in this work are named pcy1-2, pcy1-3, pcy1-4, and pcy1-5, and the new locus is named PCY2. Expression of PetE in plants is restricted to photosynthetic tissues and is responsive both to light and to (as yet) unidentified signals derived from plastids (e.g. Refs. 14Last D.I. Gray J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 14: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 15Vorst O. Kock P. Lever A. Weterings B. Weisbeek P. Smeekens S. Plant J. 1993; 4: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These expression characteristics are common to most genes encoding proteins that function in photosynthesis. In some green algae and cyanobacteria, the expression of the Pcy1/petE gene can be regulated by availability of copper (a cofactor that is essential for function of the gene product). In these organisms, if sufficient amounts of copper are available in the micronutrient source, plastocyanin is synthesized and accumulates to the stoichiometry required for photosynthesis. On the other hand, if the organism faces conditions of nutritional deficiency (with respect to copper), plastocyanin accumulation is prevented and an alternate, heme-containing, cytochrome is induced as a functional substitute. The regulatory components involved in copper-responsive plastocyanin accumulation are not known, but unlike the tissue-specific and light-responsive regulators, these components are expected to be specific for plastocyanin expression. The protein product of the PetE/Pcy1 gene is a precursor molecule, which is targeted after translation to the chloroplast. Upon import into the chloroplast, the pre-protein is processed to an intermediate form, which serves as a substrate for the ATP/secA-dependent thylakoid import apparatus (16Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 17Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M. Cline K. Science. 1994; 266: 796-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A lumen-facing thylakoid peptidase (18Kirwin P.M. Elderfield P.D. Williams R.S. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18128-18132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cleaves the intermediate form to yield the mature polypeptide, which can associate with copper to form the functional holoprotein (19Li H. Theg S.M. Bauerle C.M. Keegstra K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6748-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the post-translational component of plastocyanin biosynthesis includes steps that are common in the biosynthesis of most, if not all, nucleus-encoded lumenal proteins, such as transport of the pre-protein across the envelope membranes into the chloroplast (8Keegstra K. Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 471-501Crossref Google Scholar, 21Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Transport across the thylakoid membrane, on the other hand, is a step that is shared with only a few other nucleus-encoded lumenal proteins (e.g. OEE1 and polypeptide F of PSI), 2The abbreviations used are: PSIPhotosystem IPSIIPhotosystem IIcytcytochromeOEE133-kDa subunit of the oxygen evolving enhancer complexTAPTris-acetate-phosphate. while copper ligation is expected to be a step that is unique to plastocyanin biosynthesis. Photosystem I Photosystem II cytochrome 33-kDa subunit of the oxygen evolving enhancer complex Tris-acetate-phosphate. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as in other green algae, plastocyanin accounts for the bulk of the copper content of the cell. The green algae appear to lack other abundant copper enzymes such as Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (normally found in both the stromal and cytosolic compartments) and polyphenol oxidase (normally found in the thylakoid lumen). The organism thus lends itself to the study of copper-dependent biosynthetic processes in the chloroplast. We were interested in the identification of genes or genetic loci whose products were required in trans for holoplastocyanin formation and its copper-responsive accumulation in the thylakoid lumen. In bacterial experimental systems, a genetic approach proved very fruitful for the identification of components required for the assembly of metalloenzymes. For instance, studies of urease synthesis in Klebsiella aerogenes led to the identification of genes required for nickel transport and metabolism (22Lee M.H. Mulrooney S.B. Renner M.J. Markowicz Y. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4324-4330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and analysis of PSII mutants of cyanobacteria led to the identification of an operon encoding a putative manganese transporter (23Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, such an approach has not yet been fully exploited in a eukaryotic experimental system with its added level of biosynthetic complexity. With a view to further dissecting the plastocyanin biosynthetic pathway, we sought to identify non-photosynthetic mutants of C. reinhardtii whose phenotype could be attributed to a deficiency in plastocyanin function. In this work, we describe the identification of five plastocyanin mutants from a collection of UV-induced non-photosynthetic C. reinhardtii strains. Four of the five mutants carry mutations in the Pcy1 gene encoding pre-apoplastocyanin, while the fifth may define a new locus (PCY2) required for plastocyanin function.1 C. reinhardtii wild-type strain CC125 was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center, Duke University, Durham, NC. Strain ac208 (pcy1-1) (see Footnote 1), isolated by Gorman and Levine in 1965 (49Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), has been characterized previously (24Quinn J. Li H.H. Singer J. Morimoto B. Mets L. Kindle K. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7832-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five plastocyanin-deficient mutants were generated by UV mutagenesis of strain CC125. Cultures of wild-type strains were grown at 22°C in TAP medium (1Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar) under fluorescent illumination (15-125 μmol·m−2·s−1) with agitation (225 rpm). Mutant strains were grown under the same conditions except that the illumination was always reduced (15-25 μmol·m−2·s−1). For some experiments, the mutant strains were cultured on the laboratory bench at room temperature under fluorescent house lights with occasional swirling, and transferred to an incubator (22°C, 15-25 μmol·m−2·s−1, 225 rpm) only 1-2 days before they were collected for biochemical analysis. The wild-type strain was grown in TAP medium to a density of 2.8-22 × 106 cells/ml at a light intensity of 125 μmol·m−2·s−1, transferred to 15 × 100-mm plastic Petri dishes (20 ml total volume) and exposed to UV irradiation (254 nm, ∼ 2 × 102 microwatts·m−2) for 1-5 min. The cells were kept in suspension during irradiation by stirring or agitation on a vortex mixer. Samples were removed after the desired amount of irradiation and plated on TAP medium to test for survival (28-58% after 2 min of irradiation) or subjected to metronidazole treatment to enrich for non-photosynthetic survivors (25Erickson J.M. Ort D.R. Yocum C. Erickson J.M. Ort D.R. Yocum C. Erickson J.M. Ort D.R. Yocum C. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 589-619Google Scholar). One ml of irradiated cells (diluted to 1.4-22 × 105 total cells/ml) was plated on thin agar slabs over solid medium containing acetate (1.5% agar in TAP) and allowed to recover in the dark for 24-48 h. The agar slabs were prepared by pouring 2% agar in TAP medium over sterile 85-mm diameter circles cut out of Miracloth (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and placed in sterile 100-mm Petri dishes. The solidified slabs (2 mm depth) were transferred to traditional agar plates. (In some experiments, the cells were illuminated at ∼ 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 for 24 h prior to metronidazole treatment.) The agar slabs were transferred to fresh plates (1.5% agar in TAP) containing metronidazole (20 mM), incubated for an additional 24-48 h under illumination (50 μmol·m−2·s−1), transferred back to fresh plates lacking metronidazole, and incubated in either dim light (<5 μmol·m−2·s−1) or medium light (50 μmol·m−2·s−1) to allow survivors to grow. Colonies (between 15 and 272/plate) were apparent after 2-3 weeks. Since the enrichment procedure was conducted on solid medium with little opportunity for cells to divide after mutagenesis, each colony was expected to represent an independent mutation. The colonies were suspended in 50 μl of minimal medium (lacking acetate) (1Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar) in sterile 96-well microtiter dishes, and tested for their acetate-requiring phenotype by replica-stamping cells on solid (1.5% agar, 150-mm plates) minimal medium or TAP medium (two plates). One TAP plate (used as a master plate) was maintained in dim light, while the other two were incubated in brighter light. Growth was assessed after 2 weeks. Colonies that did not grow on minimal medium or grew much slower than wild-type cells on minimal medium were picked from the master plate, restreaked to isolate single colonies, and rescreened for acetate-requirement. To test for plastocyanin accumulation, each acetate-requiring strain was grown as a lawn on a Petri dish (100 mm). The cells were collected by scraping them off with a razor blade, and resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The soluble cell extract was prepared and analyzed as described below. Each mutant strain was back-crossed to the wild-type strain (CC124). The procedures for generating gametes, mating, germination, and isolation of spores, have been described (1Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). Colonies resulting from a single spore were tested for their acetate-requiring phenotype, and transferred to liquid medium to grow cultures which were analyzed for plastocyanin and cytochrome c6 accumulation by immunoblot analysis of soluble protein extracts (see below). For complementation tests, progeny isolates, derived from the back-cross of each mutant strain, were crossed with ac208 (pcy1-1) strains to obtain sheets of young zygotes as described previously (26Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Girard-Bascou G. Choquet Y. Rochaix J.-D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 223: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); the resulting diploid zygotes were analyzed for their fluorescence induction kinetics (27Bennoun P. Delepelaire P. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, New York1982: 25-38Google Scholar) in comparison to zygotes that were homozygous for the pcy1-1 (ac208) allele. Total DNA was isolated from 100 ml of late log phase cultures of each mutant strain as described in Ref. 28Kindle K.K. Schnell R.A. Fernandez E. Lefebvre P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar. Fragments of interest were amplified as described previously (24Quinn J. Li H.H. Singer J. Morimoto B. Mets L. Kindle K. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7832-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 100 ng of total DNA was used for each reaction instead of 500 ng. After amplification, the products were separated by electrophoresis, the fragment of interest was purified (29Tautz D. Renz M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and the entire amount was used as a template for sequencing reactions. The sequence of the genomic fragment from position −57 to +907 (24Quinn J. Li H.H. Singer J. Morimoto B. Mets L. Kindle K. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7832-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to the entire plastocyanin-encoding sequence, was determined on both strands for the gene from each mutant strain. In the case of pcy2-1, the amplified fragments were cloned and the cloned DNA was sequenced. The equivalent DNA fragments from wild-type strain CC125 were sequenced and analyzed in parallel lanes for comparison with the sequence determined from the mutant strains. Any differences in sequence were confirmed by repetition of the analysis. Except for mutations as discussed under “Results,” no other differences in sequence were noted. Cells from liquid cultures in late log phase were collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 5 min), washed once in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), and resuspended in a minimal volume (5 × 108/ml) of the same solution. Cells were lysed by two cycles of slow freezing to −80°C followed by thawing to room temperature. The soluble cell extract was separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation (15,850 × g) in a microcentrifuge at 4°C, and stored at −80°C until they were analyzed. Protein concentration was estimated by the Coomassie dye binding method as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). The proteins were separated by non-denaturing or denaturing gel electrophoresis as described previously (30Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Alternatively, specific proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. The primary antisera were diluted as follows: anti-plastocyanin (1:500-1:1000), anti-cyt c6 (1:500), anti-OEE1 (1:500-1:1000), anti-CF1 (1:10,000), and anti-PsaF (1:1000). Bound primary antibody was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chromogenic substrate (Bio-Rad). For the initial analysis of plastocyanin-deficient mutants, RNA was isolated from 50-100 ml of C. reinhardtii cultures according to previously described procedures, and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization or by translation in vitro (30Li H.H. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hill K.L. Li H.H. Singer J. Merchant S. J. Biol.

To assess the effect of cycloheximide on transcript stability (Fig. 3), 25 ml of cells were sampled from 100-ml cultures of the various strains (grown in TAP medium, ∼ 27 μmol m−2 s−1, 22°C, 180 rpm). Plastocyanin-encoding mRNAs were identified by hybridization to a 577-base pair EcoRI fragment (cDNA insert from pTZ18RCrPC6-2), and mRNAs encoding the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase were identified by hybridization to a radiolabeled fragment from plasmid pM1 corresponding to the cDNA sequence (33Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Merchant S. Hill K. Kim J.H. Thompson J. Zaitlin D. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12372-12379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two different procedures were used for analyzing plastocyanin synthesis. To examine the time course of precursor processing (Fig. 4), the cells were radiolabeled as described previously (35Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were cultured in copper-free, reduced sulfate (95 μM sulfate) TAP medium to densities of 2-18 × 106/ml and collected by centrifugation (3,800 × g, 5 min). The pelleted cells were washed once with 0.5 volume of copper-free, sulfate-free TAP medium, and resuspended in the same medium to a final concentration of 1 × 108/ml. The concentrated cells were allowed to recover for 1 h in an incubator (22°C, 250 rpm, 90 μmol·m−2·s−1). Fifteen minutes before the addition of radioisotope, CuCl2 was added to a final concentration of 6 μM. Radiolabeling was initiated by the addition of Na235SO4 (1,488 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) to a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml. The cells were maintained in a water bath (18°C) under illumination (90 μmol·m−2·s−1) with periodic agitation by hand during the course of the labeling experiment. Cells were sampled by removing 0.2-ml aliquots into 1 ml of ice-cold acetone. The sample was immediately vortexed vigorously and left at 0 C for 30 min before the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 min). The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 100 μl of solution A (2% SDS, 60 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.6), 60 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5 mM benzamidine, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by vortex agitation and heating (90°C, 5 min). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Plastocyanin was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant (95 μl) as described previously (35Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) except that cytochrome c6 was preimmunoprecipitated from the samples. (The remaining 5 μl was diluted 10-fold and used to assess radioisotope incorporation as trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts.) The immunoprecipitate was solubilized in solution A and subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation. The final IgGSORB pellet from the second immunoprecipitation was resuspended in 60 μl of sample buffer for electrophoresis on denaturing gels containing SDS, and boiled for 5 min to release the bound proteins. The IgGSORB was removed by centrifugation, and the entire supernatant was loaded on the gel. To examine the stability of plastocyanin in vivo (Fig. 5), the cells were grown in copper-deficient, reduced sulfate medium as described above, and labeled as described previously (36Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15850-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Copper (6 μM) was added as the chloride salt, where indicated. Labeled cells (pcy2-1 at 2.4 × 106/ml or CC125 at 5.9 × 106/ml) were sampled (150 ml) and collected by centrifugation (3,800 × g, 5 min). The pelleted cells were washed with 15 ml of a cold solution containing 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 10 mM Na2SO4, collected by centrifugation (3,400 × g, 2 min), and resuspended in 150 μl (pcy2-1) or 200 μl (CC125) of 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0). The cells were lysed by freeze-thaw cycles (3 times), cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and plastocyanin was immunoprecipitated from a portion of the supernatant (∼14-20 μl, corresponding to an equivalent amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity) as described previously, except that 50 mM dithiothreitol was used instead of 2-mercaptoethanol in the initial denaturing solution. Agar was purchased from either JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS) or from Life Technologies, Inc., and metronidazole was from Sigma. All other materials have been specified or are described in the cited publications. A collection of non-photosynthetic strains that survived UV mutagenesis was generated, and each strain was tested for plastocyanin accumulation. Soluble extracts were prepared from a lawn of cells scraped off a single agar plate. The plastocyanin content in the extracts was assessed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Of 1122 strains tested, four were found to be completely deficient in plastocyanin accumulation, pcy1-2, pcy1-3, pcy1-4, and pcy1-5; one additional strain appeared to accumulate apoplastocyanin at the expense of holoplastocyanin (pcy2-1). Each mutant was also checked for the accumulation of other proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus, including OEE1 (a lumenal polypeptide associated with PSII; Fig. 1C), cyt c6 (a lumenal polypeptide that replaces plastocyanin; Fig. 1D), cyt f (not shown), and the ATP synthase (not shown) in order to identify mutants that might be affected in biosynthetic processes that were required for other thylakoid membrane proteins. The abundance of these proteins was unaffected, which suggested that the defect in the plastocyanin-deficient strains was likely to be restricted to plastocyanin accumulation. The record of mutagenesis experiments indicated that each strain arose from an independent experiment. Since plastocyanin is not essential for photosynthesis in copper-deficient cultures of C. reinhardtii where cyt c6 functions in place of plastocyanin, the mutants were expected to exhibit a conditional (copper-dependent) acetate-requiring phenotype if the defect were confined to plastocyanin function. Accordingly, each strain was checked for its acetate-requiring phenotype in copper-deficient medium. Indeed, each strain grew well on copper-deficient minimal medium but grew poorly or not at all on copper-supplemented minimal medium. On copper-supplemented acetate-containing medium, each strain exhibited resistance to metronidazole which confirmed that their non-photosynthetic phenotypes resulted from a defect in the electron transfer apparatus (37Schmidt G.W. Matlin K.S. Chua N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 610-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Fluorescence induction kinetics revealed normal PSII function (not shown). These results confirmed that for each mutant strain, the acetate-requiring phenotype could be attributed to a loss of plastocyanin function. Each mutant strain (derived from a mt+ wild-type strain) was subsequently back-crossed to the wild-type strain, and resulting spores were analyzed for plastocyanin accumulation. Since the strains had a tendency to accumulate suppressor mutations, the spores were analyzed for plastocyanin accumulation rather than for their acetate-requiring phenotype (data not shown). The results showed that the plastocyanin-deficient phenotype could be ascribed to a single locus, which displayed Mendelian inheritance. The suppressor phenotype, resulting generally from copper-independent accumulation of cyt c6 (38Merchant S. Bogorad L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2531-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), segregates independently from the original mutation, which supports the contention that Cyc6 expression is not tightly linked to plastocyanin function. In previous work (24Quinn J. Li H.H. Singer J. Morimoto B. Mets L. Kindle K. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7832-7841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we had analyzed a plastocyanin-deficient mutant, strain ac208 (pcy1-1), and determined that its phenotype resulted from a frameshift mutation in the Pcy1 gene. To test whether the new mutants represented alleles at the PCY1 locus or a new locus, each strain was tested for its ability to complement pcy1-1. Four strains, pcy1-2, pcy1-3, pcy1-4, and pcy1-5, clearly failed to complement pcy1-1. Accordingly, we concluded that those strains were defective in the expression of the Pcy1 gene. The results of the complementation tests between pcy2-1 and pcy1-1 were difficult to interpret unambiguously, owing to the ver"

In a previous study (Mehari, T., Qiao, F., Scott, M. P., Nellis, D., Zhao, J., Bryant, D., and Golbeck, J. H. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 28108-28117), we showed that when cysteines 14 and 51 were replaced with serine or alanine, the free proteins contained a S = 1/2, [4Fe-4S] cluster at the unmodified site and a mixed population of S = 1/2, [3Fe-4S] and S = 3/2, [4Fe-4S] clusters at the modified site. We show here that these mutant PsaC proteins can be rebound to P700-FX cores, resulting in fully functional PS I complexes. The low temperature EPR spectra of the C14XPsaC·PS I complexes (where X = S, A, or G) show the photoreduction of a wild-type FA cluster and a modified FB′ cluster, the latter with g values of 2.115, 1.899, and 1.852 and linewidths of 110, 70, and 85 MHz. Since neither alanine nor glycine contains a suitable side group, an external thiolate provided by β-mercaptoethanol has likely been recruited to supply the requisite ligand to the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The EPR spectrum of the C51SPsaC·PS I complex differs from that of the C51APsaC·PS I or C51GPsaC·PS I complexes by the presence of an additional set of resonances, which may be derived from the serine oxygen-ligated cluster. In all other mutant PS I complexes, a wild-type spin-coupled interaction spectrum appears when FA and FB are simultaneously reduced. Single turnover flash studies indicate ∼50% efficient electron transfer to FA/FB in the C14SPsaC·PS I, C51SPsaC·PS I, C14GPsaC·PS I, and C51GPsaC·PS I mutants and less than 40% in the C14APsaC·PS I and C51APsaC·PS I mutants, compared with ∼76% in the PS I core reconstructed with wild-type PsaC. These data are consistent with the measurements of the rates of cytochrome c6-NADP+ reductase activity, indicating lower rates in the alanine mutants. It is proposed that the chemical rescue of a [4Fe-4S] cluster with a recruited external thiolate at the modified site allows the mutant PsaC proteins to rebind to PS I and to function in forward electron transfer.

Electron transfer proteins of the class “ferredoxins” typically contain iron-sulfur clusters ligated to cysteine thiolates supplied by the polypeptide backbone. The most common representatives of this protein class incorporate the widely distributed [2Fe-2S], [3Fe-4S], and [4Fe-4S] clusters (1Moura, J. J. G., Macedo, A. L., Palma, P. N., Peck, H.

The sequence and the kinetics of electron transfer between the FX, FB, and FA iron-sulfur clusters and to the [2Fe-2S] soluble ferredoxin are not well understood. One of the major experimental difficulties is the near-identity of the optical signatures of FX, FB, FA, and ferredoxin, and the attendant problem of correlating a given acceptor with observed electron transfer kinetics. Although FX, FB, FA, and ferredoxin are distinguishable by low temperature EPR spectroscopy, electron exchange among these redox carriers typically occurs within the rise time of the spectrometer. One approach to differentiating between the iron-sulfur clusters is to modify the kinetic, thermodynamic, and/or spectroscopic properties by altering a cysteine ligand to one of the cubane irons. The most radical change would be to convert a [4Fe-4S] cluster to a [3Fe-4S] cluser, with the consequence that the reduction potential of the cluster should be driven more electropositive (9Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Beinert H. Thomson A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 222: 333-361Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Based on precedent with proteins of known structure (8Conover R.C. Kowal A.T. Fu W. Park J.-B. Aono S. Adams M.W.W. Johnson M.K. J. Biol.

The amino acid sequence of PsaC has sufficient similarity with the 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxins from Peptococcus aerogenes and Clostridium pasteuranium to predict a similar three-dimensional backbone structure, especially in the region surrounding the iron-sulfur clusters (12Oh-Oka H. Takahashi Y. Matsubara H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1989; 30: 869-875Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Dunn P.P.J. Packman L.C. Pappin D. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PsaC can be removed from the PS I reaction center with chaotropic agents and replaced with mutant proteins overproduced in Escherichia coli, thereby providing a facile means to alter the ligands to the cubane iron atoms. When cysteines 14 (C14DPsaC) and 51 (C51DPsaC) are individually replaced with aspartic acid and the unbound PsaC is chemically reduced, S = 1/2, [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters are found at the unmodified site, and a mixed population of S = 2, [3Fe-4S]0 and S = 3/2, [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters are tentatively identified at the modified site (14Yu L.

The mutant C14DPsaC and C51DPsaC proteins containing two [4Fe-4S] clusters, but not those containing one [3Fe-4S] and one [4Fe-4S] cluster, could be rebound to P700-FX cores to reconstitute a functional PS I complex. The mixed-ligand [4Fe-4S] clusters are capable of low temperature electron transfer from P700 to FA/FB and room temperature electron transfer to NADP+ with ferredoxin or flavodoxin. The ligand at the modified sites in the mutants was not identified; candidates include water, hydroxide ion, the carboxylate from aspartate, and the β-mercaptoethanol used in the iron-sulfur insertion protocol. Further studies with serine and alanine mutations at cysteines 14 and 51 (16Mehari T. Qiao F. Scott M.P. Nellis D.F. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28108-28117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that in addition to [3Fe-4S] clusters, S = 3/2, [4Fe-4S] clusters were likely present at the modified sites in the unbound PsaC proteins. While serine, an amino acid with a potential oxygen ligand, might be expected to support a cubane cluster, this result was quite unexpected for alanine, an amino acid that contains a methyl side group. Further complicating the issue was that the C14APsaC and C51APsaC as well as C14SPsaC and C51SPsaC could be rebound to P700-FX cores, thereby reestablishing long-lived electron transfer to either FA and/or FB. These studies led to the following generalizations for PsaC assembly: (i) free PsaC can be reconstituted with one [3Fe-4S] and one [4Fe-4S] cluster or with two [4Fe-4S] clusters, but not with a single iron-sulfur cluster or two [3Fe-4S] clusters; and (ii) PsaC can be rebound to the P700-FX core only when it contains two [4Fe-4S] clusters, but not when it contains one [3Fe-4S] and one [4Fe-4S] cluster. (The presence of only one [4Fe-4S] cluster in Hg-treated PS I complexes (17Sakurai H. Inoue K. Fujii T. Mathis P. Photosynth.

We detail the structural, functional, and dynamic properties of mutant PS I complexes, which have been reconstituted with mutant PsaC proteins that contain serine, alanine, or glycine at positions 14 and/or 51. The construction of mutant PS I complexes containing serine, alanine, or glycine in positions 14 and 51 of PsaC was accomplished using a three-step procedure: (i) biochemical resolution of a P700-FA/FB complex into P700-FX cores; (ii) production of the C14XPsaC, and C51XPsaC (X = S, A, or G) holoproteins by overexpressing the site-modified psaC genes in E. coli, purifying the apoproteins, and in vitro reinsertion of the iron-sulfur clusters with iron, sulfide, and β-mercaptoethanol (or dithiothreitol); and (iii) rebinding of the PsaC holoproteins to P700-FX cores in the presence of PsaD and PsaE (summarized in Ref. 20Golbeck J.H.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211925) Google Scholar). Transient absorbance changes of P700 at 820 nm (ΔA820) were measured from the microseconds to tens-of-seconds time domain as described in Ref. 29Vassiliev I. Jung Y.-S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar. Each sample was excited at flash energies of 250 μJ and 53 mJ, the latter being saturating to P700 but generating a substantial contribution of 3Chl decay to the ΔA820 kinetics. The former flash energy brought about 80% saturation of tens-of-milliseconds time domain components in studied mutants, but was sufficiently low in intensity to induce little 3Chl decay. The curves were fitted to “sum of several exponentials with base-line” using the Marquardt algorithm in Igor Pro (Lake Oswego, OR). The user-defined fit function enabled a fit up to 7 exponentials with all amplitudes and rate constants set free during the fit. In most cases the fit comprised a base-line component accounting for long term phases and/or possible drift of signal zero during long time scale acquisition. The quality of the fit was estimated using standard techniques including analyses of the residuals plots and comparison of the γ-square values and standard errors of the fit parameters between different fits. Depending on the number of electron acceptors and on their relative contribution to the overall backreaction, the kinetics can be accurately fit by a sum of 4-6 exponentials. Using this approach to deconvoluting the kinetics, the PS I backreactions can be compared visually on a log time scale, and the ratio between the different pathways that contribute to the backreactions with P700+ can be estimated. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies were performed using a Bruker ECS-106 X-band spectrometer equipped with either a dual-mode (DM/4116) or standard perpendicular mode (ER/4102ST) resonator. The experimental protocol involves either freezing the sample in darkness and illuminating at low temperature to transfer one electron to the acceptor system, or freezing under continuous illumination to photoaccumulate two or more electrons in the acceptor system. Samples contained either 0.5 mg ml−1 (wild-type) or 1 mg ml−1 (mutants) Chl, 1 mM sodium ascorbate, 30 μM DCPIP in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. For chemical reduction of the FA and FB clusters, samples were suspended at a chlorophyll concentration of either 0.5 mg ml−1 (wild-type) or 1 mg ml−1 (mutants) in 250 mM glycine, pH 10 with 50 mM sodium dithionite. All data manipulations and graphics were performed using IGOR Pro 3.0. Simulations of the S = 1/2 EPR spectra were performed using the EPRSim XOP (provided by Dr. John Boswell, Oregon Graduate Institute), an adaptation of the program QPOW (30Belford, R. L., Nilges, M. J., (1979) in EPR Symposium, 21st Rocky Mountain Conference, August, 1979, Denver, Colorado.Google Scholar, 31Nilges, M.

When frozen in darkness in the presence of oxygen or K3Fe(CN)6−3, the C14XPsaC·PS I and C51XPsaC·PS I complexes (where X = A, G, or S) failed to show resonances around g = 2.02 that could be derived from an oxidized S = 1/2 ground state, [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster. Similar to the C14DPsaC·PS I complex (14Yu L. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7861-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the C51DPsaC·PS I complex (15Yu L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28118-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a search in the region of g = 10 in dithionite-reduced PS I complexes with the resonator tuned to parallel mode to detect integer spin systems did not reveal any resonances that could be attributed to a reduced S = 2, [3Fe-4S]0 cluster (data not shown). Rather, two [4Fe-4S] clusters were found in all C14XPsaC·PS I and C51XPsaC·PS I complexes. The EPR characteristics of the individual mutant PS I complexes are described in detail below. Illumination of a dark-frozen C14APsaC·PS I complex at 15 K leads to the appearance of resonances characteristic of FA with g values of 2.045, 1.943, and 1.856 (Fig. 1A). Similar to the wild-type cyanobacterial PS I complex, for which microwave power saturation renders the FA resonances maximum at ∼9 K (−10 dB microwave power; data not shown), the amplitude of the FA resonances steadily increases in the mutant PS I complex as the temperature is lowered from 12 K (Fig. 1B), becoming maximal between 9 K (Fig. 1C) and 6 K (Fig. 1D), and declining at lower temperatures (data not shown). At 12 K, a second set of resonances become prominent (Fig. 1B, arrows), with a low field g value of 2.115, and unresolved mid- and high field resonances falling between 355 and 375 mT. This signal, termed FB′ reaches a maximum amplitude at 9 K (Fig. 1C, arrows) and decreases in amplitude at 6 K (Fig. 1D) and lower temperatures (data not shown). When the C14APsaC·PS I complex is frozen during illumination, a spectrum appears with g values of 2.047, 1.937, 1.919, and 1.884 (Fig. 1, E-H), which is nearly identical to the interaction spectrum seen in the wild-type PS I complex. Unlike the latter, where the temperature optimum is ∼18 K (−10 dB microwave power), the interaction spectrum derived from reduced FA and FB′ increases in amplitude as the temperature is lowered from 18 K to 6 K (Fig. 1, F-H) and declines at lower temperatures (data not shown). The minor resonance at g = 1.756 (Fig. 1H) indicates that a small amount of FX becomes reduced under conditions of photoaccumulation. When dithiothreitol was used in the reconstitution protocol in lieu of β-mercaptoethanol, the EPR spectral results were identical to that shown in Fig. 1 (A-H) (data not shown). Like alanine, glycine is incapable of providing a ligand to an iron-sulfur cluster. Yet, the g values, linewidths, and temperature dependence of FA and FB′ in the C14GPsaC·PS I complex (see Fig. 3D for the 9 K spectrum) were identical to those in the C14APsaC·PS I complex. Photoaccumulation of the C14GPsaC·PS I complex (data not shown) leads to an interaction spectrum from reduced FA and FB′ identical to the wild-type PS I complex. In contrast, serine is capable of providing an oxygen ligand to an iron-sulfur cluster, and based on precedent with similar site-directed mutations (33Warren P.V. Smart L.B. McIntosh L. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Kowal A.T. Werth M.T. Manodori A. Cecchini G. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12284-12293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), could support the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. When the dark-frozen C14SPsaC·PS I complex is illuminated at 15 K, a set of resonances appear at g = 2.045, 1.943, and 1.856 characteristic of FA (Fig. 2A). The temperature dependence (Fig. 2, B-D) is identical to that of FA in the C14APsaC·PS I complex (see Fig. 1). Similarly, a low field resonance at g = 2.115, and mid- and high field resonances falling between 355 and 375 mT (Fig. 2, B and C, arrows) are present, which have the same spectral appearances and temperature dependences as FB′ in the C14APsaC·PS I complex. An interaction spectrum produced by photoaccumulation (Fig. 2, E-H) is also similar to that for the C14APsaC·PS I and wild-type PS I complexes. The only difference from the EPR properties of C14APsaC·PS I is the relatively intense set of resonances at g = 2.119, 1.858, and 1.756 due to reduced FX (Fig. 2H). An identical set of resonances were found in the dithiothreitol-reconstituted C14SPsaC·PS I complex (data not shown). The amount reduced FX is smaller under conditions of photoaccumulation, probably indicating a higher degree of overall reconstitution with dithiothreitol. The absence of magnetic interaction between redox centers when PS I complexes are frozen in the dark and illuminated at low temperatures allows the EPR spectrum of FB′ to be extracted from the admixture of FA and FB′. The FB′ spectrum, obtained by subtracting a simulated FA spectrum (g values of 2.045, 1.943, and 1.855, and linewidths of 15, 21, and 35 MHz) from the composite spectrum, shows a distinctive low field resonance with mid- and high field features as a partially merged set of resonances in both the C14APsaC·PS I (Fig. 3A) and C14SPsaC·PS I (Fig. 3B) complexes. Within the limits imposed by the S/N, the FB′ spectrum can be simulated using g values of 2.115, 1.899, and 1.852, and linewidths of 110, 70, and 85 MHz (Fig. 3C, solid line). The identical EPR spectra for FB′ in the C14DPsaC·PS I (14Yu L. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7861-7868Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), C14APsaC·PS I (Fig. 3A), C14GPsaC·PS I (see Fig. 3D) and C14SPsaC·PS I (Fig. 3B) complexes are consistent with a similar ligand environment surrounding the [4Fe-4S] clusters at the mutant sites. The EPR spectral properties of the FB′ cluster in the C14APsaC·PS I, C14GPsaC·PS I and C14SPsaC·PS I complexes reconstituted with dithiothreitol (data not shown) are identical to the β-mercaptoethanol-reconstituted PS I complexes. This was the expected result, since dithiothreitol is the equivalent of two tail-to-tail β-mercaptoethanol molecules. The accuracy of the simulations is illustrated in Fig. 3D, which compares an additive composite of FA and FB′ (Fig. 3D, solid line) with the experimental spectrum of the C14GPsaC·PS I complex (Fig. 3D, dotted line). Taking into account the different spin populations at their respective temperature optima of 6 K and at 9 K, double integration of the simulated FA and FB′ spectra show that they are photoreduced in a ratio of ∼1:2. In contrast, FA and FB are reduced at a ratio of ∼3.2:1 in wild-type PS I complexes under similar conditions (data not shown). The C51APsaC·PS I complex shows a set of EPR signals, which are not as easily interpreted as those in the C14APsaC·PS I complex. Illumination of a dark-frozen C51APsaC·PS I complex at 15 K leads to the appearance of resonances at g = 2.069, 1.930, and 1.880 characteristic of FB (Fig. 4A). As the temperature is lowered from 12 K to 6 K (Fig. 4, B-D), the FB resonances diminish in amplitude due to the onset of microwave power saturation, behavior that is similar to the FB cluster in the wild-type and the C51DPsaC·PS I complex (15Yu L. Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.-S. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28118-28125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A second set of resonances derived from an iron-sulfur cluster is visible at 15 K (Fig. 4A) with g values of 2.045, 1.943, and 1.856 characteristic of FA. As the temperature is lowered from 12 K to 6 K (Fig. 4, B-D), the amplitude of these resonances increases, consistent with the behavior of FA in the wild-type cyanobacterial PS I complex. When the C51APsaC·PS I complex is frozen during illumination, a complex set of resonances is found, which can be separated into two temperature-dependent sets. The first set is best observed at 6 K (Fig. 4G) and below (data not shown) and resembles the spin-coupled, interaction spectrum of FA and FB seen in wild-type PS I complexes. The second set is superimposed on these resonances and is best seen at 15 K (Fig. 4E). The extracted g values of 2.062, 1.929, and 1.900, obtained by subtracting the 6 K spectrum from the 15 K spectrum after suitable scaling, show that this set of resonances is derived from a single, non-interacting FB cluster. When the C51APsaC·PS I complex is reconstituted using dithiothreitol, a smaller spin population of FB is found when the sample is illuminated at 15 K. A spin-coupled, interaction spectrum is present with resonances at g = 2.047, 1.937, 1.919, and 1.884, similar to that in the wild-type PS I complex, and there is no evidence for the presence of a non-interacting FB cluster (data not shown). Hence, the non-interacting population of FB under conditions of photoaccumulation correlates with the amount of FB that is visible under conditions of"

In addition to its mitogenic activity, FGF-2 also stimulates cell motility, induces neurite outgrowth in neuroectodermal cells, and regulates the expression of a variety of proteins. One of the best studied of the nonmitogenic effects of FGF-2 is its regulation of the proteolytic enzyme plasminogen activator (PA). The ability to regulate PA levels is thought to be central to the role of FGF-2 as an angiogenesis factor (3Moscatelli D. Rifkin D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 948: 67-85PubMed Google Scholar). Increased PA activity contributes to the ability of angiogenic endothelial cells to invade and grow into surrounding tissues. Addition of FGF-2 to cultured endothelial cells results in a dramatic increase in production of urokinase-type PA (uPA), uPA receptors, and collagenases (4Moscatelli D. Presta M. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Presta M. Moscatelli D. Joseph-Silverstein J. Rifkin D.B. Mol. Cell.

Thus, FGF-2 action results in the generation of a constellation of proteolytic activities that are active against most components of basement membranes and the extracellular matrix. This increased proteolytic activity of endothelial cells is correlated with an increased ability to invade basement membranes, and the invasive properties of endothelial cells can be inhibited with specific inhibitors of these enzymes (8Mignatti P.

The signaling pathway used in the induction of uPA by FGF-2 is unknown. Four related tyrosine kinase receptors for FGFs have been identified. At least three of these receptors can occur in multiple alternatively spliced forms (9Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The IIIc isoforms of FGF receptor-1 and FGF receptor-2 are high affinity receptors for FGF-2, but FGF-2 can also bind with lower affinity to other members of the family. Tyrosine kinase activity is stimulated upon binding of FGF-2 to the extracellular domain of these receptors, leading to autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues (10Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of other cytoplasmic target-proteins (11Coughlin S.R. Barr P.J. Cousens L.S. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 988-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the downstream signaling pathways from the activated receptor involves binding of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ) to a phosphorylated tyrosine at residue 766 in the receptor (10Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Burgess W.H. Dionne C.A. Kaplow U. Mudd R. Friesel R. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4770-4777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bound PLCγ is phosphorylated and activated. In addition to the tyrosine kinase receptors, FGF-2 also binds to a cysteine-rich receptor which has no tyrosine kinase domain (13Burrus L.W. Zuber M.E. Lueddecke B.A. Olwin B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5600-5609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The role of this molecule in signal transduction is not clear. Finally FGF-2 binds with lower affinity to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface (14Moscatelli D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 131: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The heparan sulfates can modify the interaction of FGF-2 with the tyrosine kinase receptor. In addition, FGF-2 can be internalized directly through its interaction with heparan sulfates (15Gannoun-Zaki L. Pieri I. Badet J. Moenner M. Barritault D. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rusnati M.

Recent investigations have suggested that some responses to FGF-2 can occur in the absence of tyrosine kinase receptors (19Quarto N. Amalric F. J.

In addition, some site-directed mutations in FGF-2 that have no affect on its mitogenic properties abolish its ability to induce PA, suggesting that an additional signal beyond that necessary for mitogenesis is required for induction of PA (21Isacchi A. Statuto M. Chiesa R. Bergonzoni L. Rusnati M. Sarmientos P. Ragnotti G. Presta M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2628-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have investigated whether induction of PA requires a tyrosine kinase FGF receptor and whether both mitogenesis and induction of PA can be conferred by transfection of a single receptor, the IIIc isoform of FGF receptor-1, into L1 myoblast cells, which are devoid of endogenous FGF receptors.

Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, then incubated in serum-free medium containing 0.15% gelatin, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 ng/ml 125I-FGF-2 and other ingredients (unlabeled FGF-2, heparin, and suramin) for 2 h at 4°C on a shaker. At the end of the incubation time, cells were washed twice with PBS, and 125I-FGF-2 bound to low affinity binding sites was released with two washes with 2 M NaCl in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. 125I-FGF-2 bound to the receptor was released with two washes with 2 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. Myoblast cells were plated at 500,000 cells/35-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum with or without 30 mM chlorate. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated in fresh medium containing 0.15% gelatin and 10 ng/ml 125I-FGF-2 with or without 10 μg/ml heparin. Chlorate was added to a final concentration of 30 mM to the media of the cultures that had been preincubated in chlorate. After 0.5, 1, or 2 h at 37°C, the cells were washed twice with 2 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, to remove FGF-2 bound to heparan sulfates and receptors on the cell surface (26Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and then twice with PBS. Cells were extracted in 0.5% Triton X-100, and the amount of radioactivity in the extract was determined. To control for FGF-2 nonspecifically associated with the cell layer, parallel cultures incubated at 4°C were washed and extracted at the same time points. The amount of radioactivity associated with cells incubated at 4°C was subtracted from the amount of radioactivity associated with cells incubated at 37°C. Myoblast cells were plated in 24-well plates at 50,000 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh medium containing 0.5% calf serum for 12 h. The medium was replaced with medium containing 0.5% serum and varying concentrations of FGF-2 with or without other additions (heparin, suramin, and so forth). After incubation in this medium at 37°C for 12 h, the cells were washed twice in PBS and extracted with 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Aliquots of the samples were assayed on fibrin plates as described previously (27Gross J.L. Moscatelli D. Jaffe E.A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 947-981Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Data are expressed as milliPloug units/μg of protein. Myoblast cell lysates were prepared by extracting cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.1. The protein concentration in the lysate was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein from each lysate were run in an SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. The gel was soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h to remove the SDS. The polyacrylamide gel was laid on top of a freshly made milk/agar indicator gel and incubated at 37°C in a humid atmosphere. The milk/agar indicator gel consisted of 2% (w/v) non-fat dry milk, 2.5% agarose, and 40 μg/ml purified human plasminogen in PBS. Periodically, the milk/agar gel was examined for lysis zones. When lysis zones were observed, the gel was photographed using Polaroid 55 film. The ability of FGF receptor-1 to mediate induction of PA in response to FGF-2 was evaluated in L6 myoblast cells. These cells normally do not express detectable FGF receptors. After transfection with a cDNA encoding the isoform of human FGF receptor-1 with three immunoglobulin-like domains, clones of L6 cells expressing 20,000 to 50,000 high affinity FGF receptors per cell were selected (22Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Nontransfected cells and cells expressing FGF receptor-1 were incubated at 37°C with varying concentrations of FGF-2, and cell extracts were assayed for PA activity after 12 h. FGF-2 increased PA activity in L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1 in a dose-dependent manner reaching a plateau with 30 ng/ml (Fig. 1). At maximal stimulation, PA activity was increased 7-fold over the basal level of the enzyme. Half-maximal stimulation was obtained with approximately 5 ng/ml FGF-2, similar to the concentration required to stimulate PA in endothelial cells (4Moscatelli D. Presta M. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A similar increase in PA activity was measured in the conditioned medium of the cells (data not shown). In contrast, PA activity remained unchanged in nontransfected L6 cells regardless of the FGF-2 concentration. These results show that FGF-2 induces PA production only in L6 cells expressing the FGF receptor. Since both uPA and tissue-type PA (tPA) can convert plasminogen to plasmin, the activity measured in our assay might represent either enzyme. To examine whether the FGF-mediated changes in PA activity are due to uPA or tPA, we performed zymographic assays that separate PAs on the basis of their molecular weights. Zymography of cell extracts of nontransfected L6 cells and L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1 showed a single zone of lysis corresponding to an Mr of 50,000, which is approximately the Mr of murine uPA (Fig. 2). Exposure of the cells to 10 ng/ml FGF-2 increased the zone of lysis in L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1 but not in the nontransfected L6 cells (Fig. 2). These results show that FGF-2 regulates uPA activity in L6 myoblasts through an interaction with the FGF receptor. FGF-2 can be internalized by cells through both receptor-mediated and heparan sulfate-mediated processes (15Gannoun-Zaki L. Pieri I. Badet J. Moenner M. Barritault D. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 197: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rusnati M. Urbinati C. Presta M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Reiland J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FGF-2 internalized through heparan sulfate-mediated processes has been proposed to have a role in some responses to FGF-2 (18Reiland J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Quarto N. Amalric F. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3201-3212PubMed Google Scholar). To verify that these two internalization processes take place in L6 cells, L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1 and nontransfected L6 cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of 30 mM chlorate, which inhibits the sulfation of heparan sulfates (28Keller K.M. Brauer P.R. Keller J.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8100-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and abolishes their ability to bind FGF-2 (29Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). As soluble heparin blocks internalization of FGF-2 through the heparan sulfate-mediated mechanism but does not block internalization through receptors in Chinese hamster ovary cells (16Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of soluble heparin on FGF-2 internalization in L6 cells was also investigated. In nontransfected L6 cells, which do not express FGF receptors, addition of heparin or preincubation of the cells in chlorate inhibited internalization of FGF-2 by 80% (Fig. 3A). The combination of chlorate treatment and addition of heparin was more effective than either alone. However, in L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1, addition of soluble heparin or treatment with chlorate had no effect on the amount of FGF-2 internalized after 1 h and only moderately affected FGF-2 internalization after 2 h (Fig. 3B). The combination of chlorate treatment and addition of heparin decreased the amount of FGF internalized by about 20% after 2 h. Thus, internalization of FGF-2 by nontransfected L6 cells is inhibited by soluble heparin and chlorate treatment, whereas internalization of FGF-2 by L6 cells expressing FGF receptors is insensitive to these treatments. To determine if FGF-2 internalized through heparan sulfates has a role in the induction of uPA, the ability of FGF-2 to stimulate uPA production in the presence of soluble heparin was assessed. As shown above, 10 μg/ml soluble heparin blocks internalization of FGF-2 through the heparan sulfate-mediated mechanism but does not block binding to the receptor. L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1 and nontransfected L6 cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml heparin, and PA activity was measured 12 h later. In nontransfected cells, addition of FGF-2 had no effect on PA activity either in the absence or presence of heparin. In contrast, FGF-2 increased PA activity 3.5-fold over control values in cells expressing FGF receptor-1 (Fig. 4). Addition of soluble heparin had no effect either on basal PA levels or on the induction of PA by FGF-2 in these cells (Fig. 4). Thus, heparan sulfate-mediated internalization of FGF-2 is not involved in the induction of uPA. To determine if cell-associated heparan sulfates are involved in the induction of PA activity by FGF-2, chlorate was used to inhibit sulfation of the heparan sulfates. As shown above, treatment of cells with chlorate inhibited internalization of FGF-2 through the heparan sulfate mediated pathway. However, chlorate treatment of nontransfected cells did not effect the basal level of PA activity in these cells (Fig. 4). In addition, chlorate treatment of cells expressing FGF receptor-1 had no effect either on basal PA levels or on the induction of PA by FGF-2 in these cells (Fig. 4). Addition of soluble heparin also had no effect on basal PA levels or on the induction of PA by FGF-2 in the chlorate-treated cells (Fig. 4). Thus, cell-associated heparan sulfates do not appear to be involved in the induction of uPA. The polysulfonated polyaromatic compound suramin interferes with the interactions of a number of ligands, including FGF-2, with specific receptors (30Coffey R.J. Loef E.B. Shipley G.D. Moses H.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 31Moscatelli D. Quarto N. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2519-2527Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The ability of suramin to inhibit induction of PA by FGF-2 was examined. Preliminary experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of suramin on the binding of FGF-2 to L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1. When these cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml 125I-FGF-2 and varying suramin concentrations, binding of 125I-FGF-2 to both heparan sulfates and receptors on the cells was inhibited (Fig. 5A). Binding of 125I-FGF-2 to heparan sulfates was more sensitive to suramin than binding to receptors. Half-maximal competition for binding to heparan sulfates was obtained with 20 μM suramin, whereas half-maximal inhibition of binding to receptors was obtained with 300 μM. Complete inhibition of 125I-FGF-2 binding to both types of binding sites occurred with 1 mM suramin. Cells incubated for 12 h at 37°C with 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and varying concentrations of suramin were assayed for PA activity. With suramin concentrations lower than 20 μM, induction of PA by FGF-2 was unaffected (Fig. 5B). Induction of PA by FGF-2 was inhibited with 1 mM suramin, a concentration that inhibited binding to both heparan sulfates and receptors. At intermediate concentrations, 30 and 300 μM, induction of PA by FGF-2 was slightly increased. Thus, concentrations of suramin that blocked binding to heparan sulfates but still permitted binding to receptors did not inhibit FGF-2 stimulation of PA activity. These results demonstrate that suramin is able to inhibit the PA-inducing capacity of FGF-2 only at concentrations that were effective in preventing binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor. The ability of mutated FGF receptors to stimulate PA activity in response to FGF-2 was evaluated. L6 cells expressing a receptor in which the tyrosine kinase activity was eliminated by substitution of an alanine for a lysine at position 514 in the kinase domain (K514A) did not produce increased PA in response to FGF-2 (Fig. 6). Similarly, no alteration of PA production in response to FGF-2 was observed in L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1-containing mutations in two tyrosine residues in the kinase domain (Y653F/Y654F). Phosphorylation of these two tyrosine residues has been shown to be essential for kinase activity of the receptor (25Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Together, these results confirm that kinase signaling through the receptor is required for PA induction. In contrast, a mutant in which tyrosine 766, the major autophosphorylation site and the binding site of PLCγ (10Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was replaced with a phenylalanine responded to FGF-2 with increased PA production (Fig. 6). Similarly, a mutant in which both tyrosine 766 and neighboring tyrosine 776 were replaced by phenylalanines also responded to FGF-2 with increased PA production. Moreover, deletion of the C-terminal 58 amino acids of the receptor containing these two tyrosines did not prevent FGF-2 induction of PA activity. These three latter mutations have been shown previously to abolish activation of PLCγ and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in these cells, but to mediate mitogenic signaling (22Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 23Sorokin A. Mohammadi M. Huang J. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17056-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All L6 cell clones expressing mutated receptors produced less PA in response to FGF-2 than the clone expressing wild-type receptors. This difference in response may be related to the numbers of receptors expressed by these cells. A second clone of L6 cells expressing fewer wild-type receptors responded to FGF-2 to the same extent as the clones expressing mutant receptors (data not shown). These results suggest that 1) induction of PA by FGF-2 requires a functional FGF receptor capable of autophosphorylation, 2) PLCγ activation and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis are not essential for PA induction, and 3) tyrosines 776 and 766 and the 58 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor containing these two tyrosines are not involved in PA induction. The results presented here demonstrate that an active tyrosine kinase FGF receptor is required for induction of uPA activity in response to FGF-2. A similar finding was recently reported by Rusnati et al. (32Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Massardi M.L. Nagamine Y. Monti E. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Apparently internalization of FGF-2 through its interaction with heparan sulfates is not involved in this response as 1) heparin concentrations that block internalization of FGF-2 through the heparan sulfate-mediated pathway did not inhibit the induction of uPA by FGF-2 in cells expressing FGF receptors, 2) inhibition of heparan sulfate-mediated internalization by chlorate treatment had no effect on induction of uPA by FGF-2, and 3) suramin, at concentrations that completely block binding to heparan sulfates, did not block induction of PA by FGF-2. Furthermore, it has previously been shown using these same cells that introduction of FGF receptor-1 established a mitogenic response to FGF-1 (22Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that DNA synthesis is also stimulated by FGF-2 in L6 cells expressing FGF receptor-1 (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that both a mitogenic response and induction of PA can be mediated by a single isoform of FGF receptor-1. Differences in sensitivity of these two responses to various reagents (32Rusnati M. Dell'Era P. Urbinati C. Tanghetti E. Massardi M.L. Nagamine Y. Monti E. Presta M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) may be due to differences in post-receptor pathways of signal transduction. In the experiments presented here, treatment of L6 cells with chlorate inhibited binding of FGF-2 to heparan sulfates (data not shown) and inhibited FGF-2 internalization through the heparan sulfate-mediated pathway, but had no effect on the induction of uPA by FGF-2 in cells expressing FGF receptor-1. This result is consistent with our previous finding that heparan sulfates or heparin are not required for the binding of FGF-2 to its receptor (33Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with the recent report that heparan sulfates are not required for FGF-2 activity in Balb/c 3T3 cells (34Fannon M. Nugent M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17949-17956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although heparin or heparan sulfates are not required for binding of FGF-2 to its receptor, they alter the affinity of the FGF-2-receptor interaction so that FGF-2 binds to its receptor at lower concentrations in the presence of heparin than in the absence of heparin (33Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of FGF-2 used in the experiments presented here was sufficient to saturate FGF receptor-1 both in the presence and absence of heparin (33Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, under these conditions, the absence of heparan sulfates should have no effect on FGF-2 interactions with FGF receptor-1. PA can be induced in endothelial cells by both FGF-2 and phorbol esters (4Moscatelli D. Presta M. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2091-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27Gross J.L. Moscatelli D. Jaffe E.A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 947-981Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Both FGF-2 and phorbol esters increase PA levels to the same extent at their maximum effective concentrations, and their effects are not additive. Addition of FGF-2 to suboptimal concentrations of phorbol ester can complete the partial stimulation of PA by phorbol ester, and vice versa (data not shown). These observations suggested that the signaling pathways of FGF-2 and phorbol esters converge. One possible point of convergence is the activation of protein kinase C. Phorbol esters bind to and directly activate protein kinase C. FGF-2 binding to its receptor causes autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine 766, which provides a binding site for the SH-2 domains of PLCγ (10Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bound PLCγ is phosphorylated and activated. Diacyl glycerol released by hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol by the activated PLCγ may stimulate protein kinase C. However, the results presented here demonstrate that induction of PA by FGF-2 does not require activation of PLCγ, and suggests that these signaling pathways converge at another point. This conclusion is consistent with previous observations that induction of PA in fetal bovine endothelial cells by FGF-2 was not blocked by down-regulation of or by inhibitors of protein kinase C (35Presta M. Maier J.A.M. Rusnati M. Ragnotti G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Presta M. Maier J.A.M. Ragnotti G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutations that abolish PLCγ signaling also have no effect on FGF induction of proliferation in L6 cells, neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and motility in fibroblasts (22Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Spivak-Kroizman T. Mohammadi M. Hu P. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Lax I. J.

Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 1: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of PLCγ is also not required for these responses. Characterization of the signaling pathway of FGF receptor mutants that abolish activation of PLCγ shows that, although activation of Sos-1 and Ras are normal, activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinases are reduced (39Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutations that abolish PLCγ signaling in the PDGF receptor also have no effect on the ability of PDGF to induce proliferation. However, in PDGF receptors that are not able to induce proliferation as a result of mutation of all phosphorylated tyrosines that bind to signaling molecules, a proliferative response can be restored on restoration of PLCγ signaling (40Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that there may be two pathways of activation of MAP kinase, one through activation of Ras and one through activation of PLCγ. Signaling through either pathway may be enough to induce some responses. Thus, although PLCγ activation is not required for PA induction, it is still possible that it may be sufficient for PA induction. However, Besser et al. (41Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar) have recently shown that expression of dominant negative Ras, Raf-1, or ERK-2 in NIH 3T3 cells can abolish the induction of uPA by FGF-2, suggesting that the Ras pathway is the predominant signaling pathway used in FGF-2 induction of uPA. It is interesting to note that almost the entire C terminus of FGF receptor-1 beyond the tyrosine kinase domain can be eliminated without adverse effect on the induction of PA by FGF-2. This finding demonstrates that the signaling molecules required for induction of uPA interact with sequences in the juxtamembrane region, the kinase insert, or the kinase domain itself. Additional tyrosines in these regions that are phosphorylated upon activation of FGF receptor-1 have recently been identified (25Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). FGF activation of its receptor has been shown to activate the grb-2/sos, Ras, Raf-1, MAP kinase pathway. However, the signaling molecules other than PLCγ that interact directly with FGF receptor-1 have not yet been identified. Further characterization of the signaling elements required for uPA induction must await the identification of the molecules that directly interact with the FGF receptor."

A comparable series of chaperone-mediated reactions is assumed to occur with the N-terminal segment of the nascent polypeptide to facilitate its folding on ribosomes. Molecular chaperones have been shown in many studies to facilitate refolding of proteins from their denatured state. However, the mechanism by which nascent proteins are initially folded into their native conformation is not known. Several reports indicate that proteins fold on ribosomes during translation (Kudlicki et al., 13Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Merrill G.A. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol.

However, the mechanism by which this folding takes place and the role of molecular chaperones in this process has not been established. Our previous results demonstrated that Escherichia coli ribosomes isolated from a cell-free transcription/translation reaction mixture after synthesis of bovine rhodanese contain appreciable amounts of full-length, inactive rhodanese bound to the ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNA. These ribosome-bound polypeptides could be released in enzymatically active form by incubation with all five of the bacterial chaperones (DnaJ, DnaK, GrpE, GroEL, and GroES). DnaJ appeared to interact with the N-terminal segment of the nascent protein on the ribosome as the first step in a chaperone-mediated reaction sequence (Kudlicki et al., 12Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, Hartl and his co-workers (Langer et al., 18Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) concluded that DnaK binds first to the nascent protein followed by DnaJ and GrpE as the growing peptide emerges from the ribosome during translation. Later, Hartl and co-workers reported that DnaJ may be the first of the molecular chaperones to interact with the nascent peptide on ribosomes as they observed cross-linking between DnaJ and luciferase peptides emerging from wheat germ ribosomes (Hendrick et al., 6Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Binding of peptides to DnaK has been studied extensively. Stimulation of DnaK's intrinsic low ATPase activity was usually taken as a measure of interaction. By this measure it was determined that the minimal length of the peptide for activity was 8-9 amino acids (Jordan and McMacken, 7Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4563-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These authors also found that DnaJ in a 1000-fold lower concentration than the peptide used would stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK. Peptides with hydrophobic residues had relatively high activity (Gragerov et al., 5Gragerov A. Zeng L. Zhao X. Burkholder W. Gottesman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The role of ATP in the functional cycle of the DnaK system was analyzed kinetically by McCarty et al. (19McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Their main results relevant to the data presented here was that DnaJ stabilized the DnaK-peptide interaction in the presence of ATP. Several other reports indicated high affinity of DnaK for the peptide only in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ADP (Landry et al., 17Landry S. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.

Another point relevant to data presented below is the observed conformational change of DnaK induced by ATP affecting the ATPase activity and the substrate binding domains (Buchberger et al., 1Buchberger A.

Direct binding of a small peptide to the molecular chaperone DnaJ has not been demonstrated. Hartl and co-workers described interaction with DnaJ of partially folded rhodanese and of casein but not of reduced carboxymethylated α-lactalbumin (Langer et al., 18Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). More recently, denatured luciferase was shown to bind first to DnaJ; then DnaK formed a ternary complex with the former two components (Szabo et al., 25Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To investigate further the interaction of the molecular chaperones with the N terminus of nascent rhodanese, we used a peptide corresponding in sequence to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of native bovine rhodanese: VHQVLYRALVSTKWLAE. Coumarin was then covalently attached to this peptide at its free amino group(s). The fluorescently labeled peptide was purified by HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDCC7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acidAMP-PCPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphateRel Qrelative fluorescence quantum yield. Interaction of this peptide with molecular chaperones and with ribosomes in the absence and presence of the chaperones was monitored by fluorescence. The results presented here demonstrate that the N-terminal peptide of rhodanese has high affinity for DnaJ. In the absence of DnaK and GrpE, nucleotides have no apparent effect on this interaction. Similarly, the peptide by itself appears to have a binding site on ribosomes that is on the 50 S ribosomal subunit. An ATP-dependent reaction cycle involving DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE is demonstrated in the presence and absence of 70 S ribosomes. high performance liquid chromatography 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylene)triphosphate relative fluorescence quantum yield. Nucleoside triphosphates and E. coli tRNA were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim; the succinimidyl ester of 7-diethylaminocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid (DCC) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). tRNAfMet, rifampicin, sparsomycin, and all other biochemicals were from Sigma. [14C]Leucine was purchased from Dupont NEN. The chaperones DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, GroEL, and GroES were bought from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). DnaJ was also obtained from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). The plasmid used was pSP65 containing the rhodanese coding sequence under the SP6 promoter (Kudlicki et al., 11Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16549-16553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of 70 S salt-washed ribosomes as well as the 50 and 30 S ribosomal subunits was carried out as described previously (Odom et al., 22Odom O.W. Robbins D.J. Lynch J. Dottavio-Martin D. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 17 amino acids of bovine rhodanese (Miller et al., 21Miller D.M. Delgado R. Chirgwin J.M. Hardies S.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4686-4691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was synthesized and purified as described in Merrill et al. (20Merrill G.A. Miller D. Chirgwin J. Horowitz P.M. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The purified peptide was evaporated to dryness under vacuum and redissolved in H2O. It has an absorbance maximum at 276 nm where the molar extinction coefficient is estimated to be about 6,000 on the basis of 1 tyrosine and 1 tryptophan residue. The purified peptide was labeled at its N-terminal α-amino group and/or at the ϵ-amino group of its lysine residue as follows. The fluorescent probe used was the succinimidyl ester of DCC. The reaction was conducted in 100 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), 40% dimethylformamide, 0.35 mM peptide, and 4 mM DCC ester for 30 min at 37°C. The peptide was then precipitated by addition of 9 volumes of acetonitrile. Unreacted DCC ester and free DCC remain in solution and thus are separated from the precipitated peptide at this step. The precipitate was collected, washed once with acetonitrile, and taken up in 70% aqueous dimethylformamide. The sample was applied to a C3 reversed-phase column (Beckman Ultrapore, 0.46 × 7.5 cm). Then the column was washed with solution A (5% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with monitoring of the eluate absorbance at 220 nm, until it fell below 0.2. At this point a complex gradient of HPLC solution B (85% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was begun: from 0 to 20% over a period of 5 min, constant at 20% for 5 min, then from 20 to 40% over 10 min, and finally constant at 40% until the first peak of labeled peptide emerged (about 10 min after 40% solution B was reached). Two additional peaks of labeled peptide were obtained by increasing solution B to 50% over a period of 10 min, but the first peak is the one used for the studies reported here. Peptide from this peak was evaporated to dryness under vacuum and taken up in dimethylformamide at a concentration of about 0.25 mM (calculated from the absorbance of the DCC moiety at 430 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 40,000). All three DCC-labeled peptides were susceptible to proteinase K. The position of labeling of the DCC-peptide used is thought to be the ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue. Fluorescence techniques were used to monitor changes in the local environment and mobility of the DCC-labeled peptide after its interaction with molecular chaperones and ribosomes. Fluorescence measurements were carried out on a model 8000C photon-counting spectrophotometer from SLM-Aminco Instruments, Inc. (Urbana, IL) as detailed previously (Kudlicki et al., 12Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 390 nm. The coumarin-labeled peptide was used at 0.13 μM. Its fluorescence quantum yield determined from the integrated emission spectrum was arbitrarily set at 1.00. The average variability of fluorescence anisotropy for nine independent determinations with the coumarin-labeled N-terminal peptide (see Table I) was 0.141 ± 0.011. Unless stated otherwise, additions were made into the cuvette containing 420 μl of solution C (55 mM Tris-OAc (pH 7.8), 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1.9% polyethylene glycol (Mr 6,000), 27 mM phospho(enol) pyruvate, 30 mM NH4OAc, 72 mM KOAc, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mM EDTA). Chaperones, nucleotides, and ribosomes were added in amounts and in the order as indicated in the legends to the tables and figures. After incubation at 25°C for the indicated time (5 min unless otherwise specified), spectra were taken. When ribosomes with bound N-terminal peptide and chaperones were used, the samples were centrifuged in an Airfuge (Beckman) for 45 min at 150,000 × g. After centrifugation, the supernatants were carefully removed, the ribosomal pellets rinsed, then resuspended in solution C in a volume equal to that of the supernatant. Both fractions were analyzed. The distribution of the N-terminal peptide between both fractions was analyzed by fluorescence. Standard corrections for the fluorescence measurements were performed. Background values were subtracted for the buffer solution, for unlabeled peptide, for the ribosomes, and for the chaperones by themselves. In the titration experiments, volume changes were corrected by additions of solution to the blank cuvette.Table I.Binding of the coumarin-labeled peptide to ribosomes and 50 S ribosomal subunitsAdditionsFluorescence characteristicsaA, fluorescence anisotropy; λmax, wavelength of emission maximum; Rel Q, relative fluorescence quantum yield.AλmaxRel QA.

Open table in a new tab Experiments were carried out in the absence of ribosomes to determine whether a direct interaction of the N-terminal rhodanese peptide with any of the E. coli molecular chaperones could be detected by changes in fluorescence from the coumarin-labeled peptide. The fluorescence emission spectra given in Fig. 1A indicate that a large increase in fluorescence intensity occurred when the coumarin-labeled peptide was incubated with DnaJ. The relative quantum yield, fluorescence anisotropy, and emission maxima for this set of measurements are presented in the inset to Fig. 1A. A relative quantum yield of 1.00 was arbitrarily assigned to the fluorescence emission obtained with 0.13 μM of the coumarin-labeled peptide under standard conditions in the absence of chaperones or other components from E. coli. The changes in both fluorescence quantum yield and anisotropy indicate that DnaJ bound directly to the N-terminal peptide. The stoichiometry of binding between DnaJ and the peptide was determined by monitoring the increases in fluorescence intensity caused by successive addition of DnaJ to known amounts of the coumarin-labeled peptide (Fig. 2). The rate of intensity change was too rapid to be measured with the system used. The results from repeated experiments with different preparations of DnaJ indicated binding in a ratio of 0.6-1.1 peptide:DnaJ. The calculated ratio of DnaJ:peptide for the experiment represented by Fig. 2 for which the amount of both DnaJ and peptide were carefully determined was 0.98. Considering the inherent accuracy of the methods used and lack of information about the proportion of the DnaJ protein that is inactive, these results strongly indicate that 1 molecule of peptide is tightly bound per molecule of DnaJ. The linearity of the binding curve is striking and indicates that the Kd for the peptide-DnaJ complex is considerably below the concentration of the peptide (0.13 μM) and the concentration range of DnaJ that was used in these experiments. It was not possible to reliably determine Kd for the complex because of the limits in sensitivity of the system used. However, the results indicate that the Kd for the peptide-DnaJ complex is at least an order of magnitude below the concentrations used for the experiments of Fig. 2, i.e. below 13 nM. Subsequent addition of DnaK to the reaction mixture containing peptide and DnaJ (Fig. 1A) caused a decrease in the quantum yield but an increase in the anisotropy indicating the formation of a peptide-DnaJ-DnaK complex. Addition of GrpE to this reaction mixture caused an additional large decrease in both these parameters (Fig. 1A). The anisotropy decreased to near the value observed for peptide in the absence of chaperones, but the quantum yield remained significantly above that for free peptides. These data indicate that GrpE caused a major change in the peptide-DnaJ-DnaK complex, probably dissociation of peptide and/or DnaJ-peptide. If DnaK was added first (Fig. 1B), no effect on fluorescence from the peptide was detected during a 30-min period. The effects of DnaJ added subsequently after 5 min of incubation were substantially reduced (Rel Q of 2.62 versus 3.18 when DnaJ was added first). These results indicate that DnaK did not detectably bind directly to the peptide under these conditions used, but rather interacted with DnaJ or the DnaJ-peptide complex. Farr et al. (3Farr C. Galiano F. Witt S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15574-15582Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found a large activation energy barrier for interaction of DnaK with a peptide corresponding to the N terminus of the cro repressor. It is possible that the interaction of DnaK directly with the rhodanese peptide might occur at a rate that would be detected under other conditions. However, it is clear that the interaction is greatly accelerated by DnaJ. It should be noted that there are differences in the quantum yield and anisotropy depending on whether DnaJ or K were added first to the peptide. These differences remained unchanged even if the incubation time was extended to 60 min. The subsequent addition of GrpE after first DnaK then DnaJ caused a smaller decrease in fluorescence intensity than when DnaJ was added first (Rel Q of 2.37 versus 2.63). GrpE alone or added in the presence of either DnaK or DnaJ had little or no detectable effect on fluorescence from the peptide, indicating that it affects the peptide-DnaJ-DnaK complex. The reactions represented by Fig. 1, A and B, were carried out in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system. When otherwise identical experiments were repeated in the absence of ATP, phospho(enol)pyruvate and pyruvate kinase, the binding of the peptide to DnaJ in the absence of the other chaperones was very similar to that seen in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3A versus Fig. 1A). However, in the absence of ATP, the subsequent addition of DnaK caused a small increase in fluorescence intensity rather than a decrease as was observed in the presence of ATP. When DnaK was added first (no DnaJ), the observed small increases in fluorescence intensity and anisotropy indicate some direct interaction of the peptide and DnaK (Fig. 3B). This result is in agreement with reports in the literature (Landry et al., 17Landry S. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar; Palleros et al., 23Palleros D. Shi L. Reid K. Fink A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; McCarty et al., 19McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The largest difference in the presence and absence of ATP, respectively, was seen with the addition of GrpE which appears to interact with a peptide-DnaJ-DnaK complex formed in either order of chaperone addition. The results indicate that GrpE does not promote the release of the peptide from the complex when ATP is absent. To investigate this point further, a set of experiments was carried out in which ADP or the nonhydrolyzable analog, AMP-PCP, was tested in comparison to ATP; pyruvate kinase was omitted from the reaction mixture. Three samples were prepared that contained the coumarin-labeled peptide and the three chaperones in the absence of any nucleotide. Fluorescence measurements were taken and anisotropy determined. The fluorescence parameters were very similar to those given for spectrum 4 of Fig. 3B. Then either ATP, ADP, or AMP-PCP was added to the samples. The results given in Fig. 4A show a large increase in quantum yield with ADP compared with ATP or AMP-PCP. Rel Q is at a maximum at 1 min (the shortest time at which the measurement could be carried out under the conditions used) then declines with ATP, whereas it remains nearly constant with time for ADP and AMP-PCP. Rel Q at 1 min is much higher with ADP than with ATP or AMP-PCP (6.4 versus 4.4-4.6), indicating that the ADP form of the chaperone complex has a larger effect on the N-terminal coumarin probe. The changes in anisotropy, A, with time (Fig. 4B) for ADP show a sharp decline at 1 min (0.22-0.14) then increase to levels that are higher than the corresponding values with AMP-PCP or ATP at 1 min. Anisotropy is nearly constant over time with AMP-PCP but with ATP declines in parallel with the decline in Rel Q. Considered together, the results indicate that ATP and ADP cause pronounced differences in the interaction of DnaK with the peptide-DnaJ complex that is likely to reflect hydrolysis of ATP during the function of DnaK. Nucleotide-induced changes in the conformation of DnaK have been reported (Buchberger et al., 1Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that binding of ATP to DnaK induces dissociation of the chaperone from its substrate (McCarty et al., 19McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The results reported here are consistent with these observations. Coumarin is relatively hydrophobic and might cause nonspecific binding of the peptide to the chaperones. Another peptide was labeled with coumarin and used as a control. This peptide (amino acids 142-156 of bovine rhodanese) represents the tether region in the rhodanese tertiary structure connecting the two globular regions of the enzyme (Ploegman et al., 24Ploegman J.H. Drent G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G.J. Heinrikson R.L. Keim P. Weng L. Russell J. Nature. 1978; 273: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Fluorescence from the coumarin-labeled tether peptide indicated that it did not bind to DnaJ and was unaffected by DnaK or GrpE (data not shown). The results presented above appear to reflect a sequential order of chaperone interaction with the N-terminal rhodanese peptide and the dependence of these reactions on adenosine phosphates. It should be emphasized that they were carried out in the absence of ribosomes. However, previous work has demonstrated that all five of the bacterial chaperones (DnaJ, DnaK, GrpE, GroEL, and GroES) are required with nascent full-length rhodanese bound to ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNA to efficiently promote the codon-directed release of active enzyme from the ribosomes. DnaJ, DnaK and GrpE were shown to affect fluorescence from coumarin linked to the N terminus of nascent polypeptides on ribosomes. Our hypothesis is that the DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE-mediated reactions described above with the synthetic peptide in the absence of ribosomes are directly related to the function of these chaperones in folding the ribosome-bound nascent enzyme. Accordingly, experiments were carried out to investigate the relation of these reactions to binding of the coumarin-labeled N-terminal rhodanese peptide to ribosomes. Changes in fluorescence intensity, anisotropy and emission maxima indicate that the coumarin-labeled N-terminal peptide binds directly to 70 S ribosomes or 50 S ribosomal subunits but not to 30 S ribosomal subunits in the absence of chaperones (Table I). The relative fluorescence quantum yield and anisotropy increase from 1.0 and 0.14 to 4.2 and 0.29, respectively, with an amount of ribosomes that gave a near maximum effect. The results with different preparations of ribosomes were somewhat variable but generally gave a maximum effect with a peptide-to-ribosome molar ratio in the range of 0.5. This low ratio may reflect damaged or otherwise inactive ribosomes. When ribosomal subunits were analyzed individually in similar experiments, 50 S ribosomal subunits gave values for quantum yield and anisotropy that approached those observed with 70 S ribosomes. In contrast, much lower values for quantum yield and anisotropy were obtained with similar molar amounts of 30 S ribosomal subunits. When incubated with the ribosomes or ribosomal subunits, fluorescence intensity from the tether peptide was 1.6 and there was virtually no change in anisotropy or shift in the wavelength of maximal fluorescence (Table I). We interpret the results to indicate that the N-terminal peptide is bound to the 50 S ribosomal subunit. The results described above indicate that in the absence of ribosomes, DnaJ, and the labeled N-terminal peptide form a tight complex that is not detectably affected by adenosine phosphates. Accordingly experiments were carried out to determine the effects of DnaJ on binding of the peptide to ribosomes. The experiments were comparable to those for binding of the peptide to 70 S ribosomes (Table I) except for the addition of DnaJ to the reaction mixture. The results are included in Table I. In the presence of DnaJ and ribosomes, both the anisotropy and the quantum yield increased markedly to levels that were higher than with either the ribosomes or with DnaJ alone. The results appear to indicate the formation of a ternary complex between DnaJ, the N-terminal peptide and the ribosome. In the next set of experiments, the peptide was incubated with ribosomes, then subsequently with DnaJ and with DnaK plus GrpE in the presence of either ATP or ADP. Binding of the peptide to the ribosomes was determined after sedimenting the ribosomes by centrifugation through a cushion of sucrose. The percentage of the total fluorescence that was recovered in both the supernatant and ribosome fractions are given in Table II. The fluorescence anisotropy for each fraction is given in parentheses. It should be noted that since the quantum yield for each sample is unknown, the absolute amount of peptide recovered in the fraction cannot be calculated. However, the results show that about 95% of the fluorescence and presumably a high portion of the peptide remains associated with the ribosomes in the presence of DnaJ and with either ATP or ADP, or with DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE in the presence of ADP. However, with ATP in the presence of DnaK and GrpE, most of the fluorescence is released from the ribosomes into the supernatant fraction.Table II.Table II.AdditionsDistribution of peptide after ultracentrifugation (% of fluorescenceaPercent of total fluorescence, in the sample (given under %) that was recovered in the supernatant and ribosome fractions, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The results presented above demonstrate a series of reactions that take place between the molecular chaperones DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE and N-terminal (coumarin)-17 amino acid peptide corresponding to the N terminus of rhodanese. The reactions take place in the absence of ribosomes but are assumed to correspond to the function of these chaperones in folding nascent rhodanese bound to ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNA. The results indicate that DnaJ is the first of the molecular chaperones to bind to this peptide in a reaction that is not affected by ATP (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly, binding of the peptide to the ribosome is enhanced by DnaJ (Table I). DnaJ was shown to be the first of the molecular chaperones to interact with nascent polypeptides on prokaryotic or eukaryotic ribosomes as demonstrated by fluorescence (Kudlicki et al., 12Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and by cross-linking experiments (Hendrick et al., 6Hendrick J.P. Langer T. Davis T.A. Hartl F.U. Wiedmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10216-10220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). DnaK forms a stable complex when added to the peptide-DnaJ complex. However, differences were observed in both anisotropy and quantum yield depending on whether the complex was formed in the presence or absence of ATP. This may reflect ATP-induced conformational changes of DnaK (Buchberger et al., 1Buchberger A. Theyssen H. Schröder H. McCarty J.S. Virgallita G. Milkereit P. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16903-16910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). McCarty et al. (19McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) reported stable complex formation in the presence of ATP between DnaK-peptide and DnaJ. A striking difference, depending on whether ATP or ADP is present, is observed in the subsequent reactions of GrpE with the DnaJ-DnaK-peptide complex (see Fig. 4). This may be due to the effects of GrpE on ATP and its hydrolysis by DnaK, or nucleotide exchange which may affect the stability of this complex and the interaction of GrpE with it. A recent study of the ATPase cycle with DnaK mutants suggests that both DnaJ and GrpE may synergistically activate DnaK's ATPase activity and induce a conformational change in DnaK (Kamath-Loeb et al., 8Kamath-Loeb A. Lu C. Suh W. Lonetta M. Gross C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30051-30059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results with those reported here and from previous published work indicate that DnaJ, DnaK, and GrpE function together in a series of reactions which can take place with nascent chains on ribosomes. However, they do not provide a definitive answer as to whether chaperones are required for folding of all nascent proteins on ribosomes or even every molecule of nascent rhodanese. Recently, we demonstrated that ribosomes themselves, specifically the RNA of the large ribosomal subunit, can act as a “chaperone” in refolding denatured rhodanese (Kudlicki et al., 16Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Protein Folding and Design. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we suggest that the molecular chaperones do not have an obligatory role in folding of nascent rhodanese on ribosomes. They may function to renature and thereby recover nascent rhodanese that is not folded correctly during translation. This improperly folded full-length rhodanese appears to accumulate on ribosomes as peptidyl-tRNA that does not efficiently undergo codon-directed termination and release. Why folding of rhodanese and some other proteins fail during translation and how these reactions are coupled to codon and release factor-dependent termination and release of the nascent protein is not known. However, our speculation is that DnaJ interacts as the first of the molecular chaperones to bind to an improperly folded nascent peptide as it emerges from the ribosomal tunnel (Eisenstein et al., 2Eisenstein M. Hardesty B. Odom O.W. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Arad T. Franceschi F. Yonath A. Pifat G. Supramolecular Structure and Function. Balaban Publishing, Rehovot, Israel1994: 213-246Google Scholar) followed by the cycle of reactions indicated above with the N-terminal rhodanese peptide. These results are summarized in Fig. 5.

INTRODUCTIONAll known bacterial plasmids encode a specific initiator and control their replication primarily by negatively regulating its synthesis. Often, the linkage between replication and the control of initiator synthesis is indirect in that the regulatory factors act in trans and respond to the copy number of the plasmid. This type of replication control requires that the initiator be utilized stoichiometrically rather than catalytically since the latter would obviate such control. Plasmids such as pT181 and its relatives, which replicate by the rolling circle mechanism, inactivate the initiator protein automatically as a part of the termination process (1Rasooly A. Novick R.P. Science. 1993; 262: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ColE1 and its relatives, which replicate by the θ mechanism, utilize a long RNA primer as initiator and automatically degrade this primer as replication proceeds. Plasmids such as R1, which also replicate by the θ mechanism, require new protein synthesis for each round of replication (2Diaz R. Nordstrom K. Staudenbauer W.L. Nature. 1981; 289: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that the initiator is inactivated after use.The inactivation mechanism for pT181 is unique; the initiator protein, RepC, is a dimer, referred to as RepC/C, and following the completion of a round of replication, an oligonucleotide, representing sequences immediately 3′ to the initiation nicking site is attached to the active site tyrosine of one of its subunits (1Rasooly A. Novick R.P. Science. 1993; 262: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our initial experiments suggested that the heterodimeric derivative, RepC/C*, lacked the nicking, relaxation, and replication activities of the native protein. This was puzzling. Since only one of the two subunits was modified, the unmodified subunit would be expected, a priori, to have nicking activity, the reversal of which would result in relaxation, and to be able to initiate but not terminate replication. Testing of these possibilities was complicated by the fact that preparations of total RepC antigen from pT181-containing cells generally consist of 90-95% RepC/C* and 5-10% RepC/C, which represents active protein that has not been used for replication and which we have not succeeded in cleanly removing. Consequently, these preparations generally have low but definite RepC activity, making it difficult to determine with confidence whether RepC/C* itself has any activity. Although any possible activity of RepC/C* would have to be so weak that it could have little or no impact on the primary regulation of replication initiation, even weak activity could have important implications for other aspects of the plasmid life cycle, particularly since RepC/C* is metabolically stable and is present at such a high concentration. As it happens, RepC/C* has very weak nicking and relaxation activities but probably lacks replication activity. 1R. Jin, and R. P. Novick, in preparation. Additionally, we have demonstrated that RepC/C* inhibits the replication and relaxation activities of RepC/C in vitro 2R. Jin, A. Rasooly, and R. P. Novick (1996) J. Bacteriol., in press. and question whether it has any negative regulatory activity in vivo.In an attempt to understand the structural basis for the profound difference in activities of the two forms of RepC, we have compared their interactions with the pT181 leading strand origin by DNase I footprinting, KMnO4 sensitivity, and binding-bending analysis.The pT181 double strand origin (DSO) 3The abbreviations used are: DSOdouble strand originIR-I, -II, and -IIIinverted repeats I, II, and III, respectivelyTBETris borate-EDTA. of replication consists of three sets of inverted repeats, IR-I, IR-II, and IR-III (3Gennaro M.L. Iordanescu S. Novick R.P. Murray R.W. Steck T.R. Khan S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IR-II contains the initiation nicking site, and IR-III contains the specific initiator recognition site. RepC/C has several distinct activities on pT181 DNA, namely bending (4Koepsel R.R. Khan S.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), enhancement of cruciform extrusion (5Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and nicking and topoisomerase I-like relaxation (6Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in addition to replication initiation.A previously published DNase I footprint of RepC/C on a linear fragment containing the pT181 DSO showed protection of the specific RepC binding site (IR-III) and the proximal stem of the IR-II cruciform (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have re-analyzed the DNase I footprint, comparing linear with supercoiled DNA as well as RepC/C with RepC/C*. Additionally, we used potassium permanganate to compare the ability of RepC/C and RepC/C* to enhance cruciform extrusion and gel mobility measurements to determine the relative binding and bending activities and the binding constants for the two forms. We find that RepC/C and RepC/C* footprint supercoiled DNA differently although their footprints on linear DNA are similar; we also find that RepC/C* is unable to enhance cruciform extrusion and that it binds and bends the DSO much more weakly than does RepC/C. Our results suggest that the attachment of an oligonucleotide not only blocks the active tyrosine of one subunit but also causes an allosteric modification of the protein that reduces its ability to bind to the DSO and eliminates its ability to enhance cruciform extrusion, resulting in the observed loss of activity.DISCUSSIONThe objective of this study was to determine whether there are particular differences in specific properties of RepC/C versus RepC/C* that might help to define the in vivo role of RepC/C* and pinpoint the basis for the ability of RepC/C but not RepC/C* to initiate replication. Three different methodologies were used, namely, in vitro footprinting, KMnO4 sensitivity, and gel mobility analysis. Each of the three methods revealed one or more critical features that together have enabled us to formulate a model for the initiation of replication and an appreciation of the key defect in RepC/C*.As noted above, the leading strand replication origin of pT181 plasmids consists of two adjacent inverted repeats (IR-II and IR-III), which are involved in RepC recognition (3Gennaro M.L. Iordanescu S. Novick R.P. Murray R.W. Steck T.R. Khan S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The IR-III region is divergent in sequence among the members of the pT181 family and distinguishes the origin region of one member from that of the others. Only the IR-III proximal arm is required for sequence specific recognition (12Wang P.-Z. Projan S.J. Henriquez V. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike many other dimeric DNA-binding proteins, RepC/C binds asymmetrically, and its seqence-specific binding to IR-III is stabilized by its interaction with the IR-II region. The IR-II region is conserved among the six members of the pT181 family; it contains the nick site for replication initiation and forms a cruciform structure in vivo as well as in vitro (5Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Like other RC initiators, RepC/C has much higher nicking activity on single-stranded than on double-stranded DNA. Extrusion of the IR-II cruciform is thought to provide the necessary single-stranded region in the GC-rich pT181 DSO (5Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Our in vitro permanganate probing assays have shown that RepC/C is able to melt the DSO DNA on a supercoiled but not on a linear substrate. Sequence considerations make it likely that the observed melting pattern represents a cruciform; however, proof of this structure requires definitive experiments with cruciform-specific enzymes that are planned. The importance of plasmid superhelicity for cruciform extrusion is correlated with the importance of superhelicity for the initiation of replication on all circular prokaryotic replicons, including pT181. It is suggested that the inability of RepC/C* to induce melting/cruciform extrusion is the basis for its inability to initiate replication.Bending of DNA in response to regulatory protein binding is a widely observed phenomenon. Bending may facilitate the interaction of the regulatory protein with upstream or downstream DNA sequences, it may facilitate protein-protein interactions, it may introduce favorable conformational changes in DNA structure, and it may play an energetic role for biological function. RepC has been shown to enhance the bending of pT181 DSO, and the center of the induced bend corresponds to the RepC binding site (4Koepsel R.R. Khan S.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) although the exact biological significance of the RepC enhanced bending is still not clear. Gel mobility shift analysis with the two dimeric forms of RepC showed clearly that both proteins bind in a similar manner to the DSO and both enhance the previously observed bend in the same way. The bending center for both RepC/C and RepC/C* is the same. RepC/C*, however, produces a considerably smaller gel shift than RepC/C because it enhances the natural bend to a considerably smaller extent. It is notable that no binding pattern was observed that might indicate dissociation of either of the two dimeric forms. The weaker activity of RepC/C* on DNA bending might contribute to its inability to enhance melting and to initiate replication.DNase I footprinting analysis also revealed a critical difference between RepC/C and RepC/C*. Both forms of the protein showed similar protection patterns on linear DNA (confined to the IR-III region), though weaker for RepC/C*. Very weak protection in the IR-II region by RepC/C on the lagging strand was sometimes detected. This result is different from that reported previously for RepC/C by Koepsel, et al. (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), who observed protection of IR-II on linear DNA but with a much higher protein:DNA ratio (300:1) than that used here. This additional protection presumably represented much weaker or even nonspecific binding, owing to the very high protein concentration used. On supercoiled DNA, RepC/C* had the same protection pattern as on linear DNA; whereas, RepC/C additionally and strongly protected the proximal arm of IR-II. Interestingly, this protection involved the lagging strand but not the leading strand, which contains the nick site. The results confirm the asymmetric binding of RepC to the DSO as previously proposed on the basis of mutational analysis (12Wang P.-Z. Projan S.J. Henriquez V. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure of the RepC/C·DNA complex is predicted to show one subunit binding to IR-III plus the proximal arm of IR-II on the lagging strand and the second subunit positioned to nick the leading strand. Recent observations, suggesting that a RepC heterodimer with one subunit defective in nicking the other defective in IR-II binding has weak replication activity, suggest that one subunit is responsible for binding and the other for nicking. 5P. Z. Wang and R. P. Novick, unpublished data.The critical differences between RepC/C and RepC/C* are thus the greater affinity of RepC for the DSO, differential binding to supercoiled versus linear DNA, and differential ability to enhance cruciform extrusion. We suggest that the strong binding of RepC/C to IR-III (plus bending) coupled with the free energy of superhelix formation initiates melting (and, presumably, cruciform extrusion) in the IR-II region. RepC/C then binds to the proximal arm of the IR-II cruciform, which stabilizes the secondary structure and facilitates nicking.

Since only one of the two subunits was modified, the unmodified subunit would be expected, a priori, to have nicking activity, the reversal of which would result in relaxation, and to be able to initiate but not terminate replication. Testing of these possibilities was complicated by the fact that preparations of total RepC antigen from pT181-containing cells generally consist of 90-95% RepC/C* and 5-10% RepC/C, which represents active protein that has not been used for replication and which we have not succeeded in cleanly removing. Consequently, these preparations generally have low but definite RepC activity, making it difficult to determine with confidence whether RepC/C* itself has any activity. Although any possible activity of RepC/C* would have to be so weak that it could have little or no impact on the primary regulation of replication initiation, even weak activity could have important implications for other aspects of the plasmid life cycle, particularly since RepC/C* is metabolically stable and is present at such a high concentration. As it happens, RepC/C* has very weak nicking and relaxation activities but probably lacks replication activity. 1R. Jin, and R. P. Novick, in preparation. Additionally, we have demonstrated that RepC/C* inhibits the replication and relaxation activities of RepC/C in vitro 2R. Jin, A. Rasooly, and R. P. Novick (1996) J. Bacteriol., in press. and question whether it has any negative regulatory activity in vivo. In an attempt to understand the structural basis for the profound difference in activities of the two forms of RepC, we have compared their interactions with the pT181 leading strand origin by DNase I footprinting, KMnO4 sensitivity, and binding-bending analysis. The pT181 double strand origin (DSO) 3The abbreviations used are: DSOdouble strand originIR-I, -II, and -IIIinverted repeats I, II, and III, respectivelyTBETris borate-EDTA. of replication consists of three sets of inverted repeats, IR-I, IR-II, and IR-III (3Gennaro M.L. Iordanescu S. Novick R.P. Murray R.W. Steck T.R. Khan S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). IR-II contains the initiation nicking site, and IR-III contains the specific initiator recognition site. RepC/C has several distinct activities on pT181 DNA, namely bending (4Koepsel R.R. Khan S.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), enhancement of cruciform extrusion (5Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and nicking and topoisomerase I-like relaxation (6Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) in addition to replication initiation. double strand origin inverted repeats I, II, and III, respectively Tris borate-EDTA. A previously published DNase I footprint of RepC/C on a linear fragment containing the pT181 DSO showed protection of the specific RepC binding site (IR-III) and the proximal stem of the IR-II cruciform (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have re-analyzed the DNase I footprint, comparing linear with supercoiled DNA as well as RepC/C with RepC/C*. Additionally, we used potassium permanganate to compare the ability of RepC/C and RepC/C* to enhance cruciform extrusion and gel mobility measurements to determine the relative binding and bending activities and the binding constants for the two forms. We find that RepC/C and RepC/C* footprint supercoiled DNA differently although their footprints on linear DNA are similar; we also find that RepC/C* is unable to enhance cruciform extrusion and that it binds and bends the DSO much more weakly than does RepC/C. Our results suggest that the attachment of an oligonucleotide not only blocks the active tyrosine of one subunit but also causes an allosteric modification of the protein that reduces its ability to bind to the DSO and eliminates its ability to enhance cruciform extrusion, resulting in the observed loss of activity. DISCUSSIONThe objective of this study was to determine whether there are particular differences in specific properties of RepC/C versus RepC/C* that might help to define the in vivo role of RepC/C* and pinpoint the basis for the ability of RepC/C but not RepC/C* to initiate replication. Three different methodologies were used, namely, in vitro footprinting, KMnO4 sensitivity, and gel mobility analysis. Each of the three methods revealed one or more critical features that together have enabled us to formulate a model for the initiation of replication and an appreciation of the key defect in RepC/C*.As noted above, the leading strand replication origin of pT181 plasmids consists of two adjacent inverted repeats (IR-II and IR-III), which are involved in RepC recognition (3Gennaro M.L. Iordanescu S. Novick R.P. Murray R.W. Steck T.R. Khan S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The IR-III region is divergent in sequence among the members of the pT181 family and distinguishes the origin region of one member from that of the others. Only the IR-III proximal arm is required for sequence specific recognition (12Wang P.-Z. Projan S.J. Henriquez V. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike many other dimeric DNA-binding proteins, RepC/C binds asymmetrically, and its seqence-specific binding to IR-III is stabilized by its interaction with the IR-II region. The IR-II region is conserved among the six members of the pT181 family; it contains the nick site for replication initiation and forms a cruciform structure in vivo as well as in vitro (5Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Like other RC initiators, RepC/C has much higher nicking activity on single-stranded than on double-stranded DNA. Extrusion of the IR-II cruciform is thought to provide the necessary single-stranded region in the GC-rich pT181 DSO (5Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Our in vitro permanganate probing assays have shown that RepC/C is able to melt the DSO DNA on a supercoiled but not on a linear substrate. Sequence considerations make it likely that the observed melting pattern represents a cruciform; however, proof of this structure requires definitive experiments with cruciform-specific enzymes that are planned. The importance of plasmid superhelicity for cruciform extrusion is correlated with the importance of superhelicity for the initiation of replication on all circular prokaryotic replicons, including pT181. It is suggested that the inability of RepC/C* to induce melting/cruciform extrusion is the basis for its inability to initiate replication.Bending of DNA in response to regulatory protein binding is a widely observed phenomenon. Bending may facilitate the interaction of the regulatory protein with upstream or downstream DNA sequences, it may facilitate protein-protein interactions, it may introduce favorable conformational changes in DNA structure, and it may play an energetic role for biological function. RepC has been shown to enhance the bending of pT181 DSO, and the center of the induced bend corresponds to the RepC binding site (4Koepsel R.R. Khan S.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) although the exact biological significance of the RepC enhanced bending is still not clear. Gel mobility shift analysis with the two dimeric forms of RepC showed clearly that both proteins bind in a similar manner to the DSO and both enhance the previously observed bend in the same way. The bending center for both RepC/C and RepC/C* is the same. RepC/C*, however, produces a considerably smaller gel shift than RepC/C because it enhances the natural bend to a considerably smaller extent. It is notable that no binding pattern was observed that might indicate dissociation of either of the two dimeric forms. The weaker activity of RepC/C* on DNA bending might contribute to its inability to enhance melting and to initiate replication.DNase I footprinting analysis also revealed a critical difference between RepC/C and RepC/C*. Both forms of the protein showed similar protection patterns on linear DNA (confined to the IR-III region), though weaker for RepC/C*. Very weak protection in the IR-II region by RepC/C on the lagging strand was sometimes detected. This result is different from that reported previously for RepC/C by Koepsel, et al. (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), who observed protection of IR-II on linear DNA but with a much higher protein:DNA ratio (300:1) than that used here. This additional protection presumably represented much weaker or even nonspecific binding, owing to the very high protein concentration used. On supercoiled DNA, RepC/C* had the same protection pattern as on linear DNA; whereas, RepC/C additionally and strongly protected the proximal arm of IR-II. Interestingly, this protection involved the lagging strand but not the leading strand, which contains the nick site. The results confirm the asymmetric binding of RepC to the DSO as previously proposed on the basis of mutational analysis (12Wang P.-Z. Projan S.J. Henriquez V. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure of the RepC/C·DNA complex is predicted to show one subunit binding to IR-III plus the proximal arm of IR-II on the lagging strand and the second subunit positioned to nick the leading strand. Recent observations, suggesting that a RepC heterodimer with one subunit defective in nicking the other defective in IR-II binding has weak replication activity, suggest that one subunit is responsible for binding and the other for nicking. 5P. Z. Wang and R. P. Novick, unpublished data.The critical differences between RepC/C and RepC/C* are thus the greater affinity of RepC for the DSO, differential binding to supercoiled versus linear DNA, and differential ability to enhance cruciform extrusion. We suggest that the strong binding of RepC/C to IR-III (plus bending) coupled with the free energy of superhelix formation initiates melting (and, presumably, cruciform extrusion) in the IR-II region. RepC/C then binds to the proximal arm of the IR-II cruciform, which stabilizes the secondary structure and facilitates nicking. The objective of this study was to determine whether there are particular differences in specific properties of RepC/C versus RepC/C* that might help to define the in vivo role of RepC/C* and pinpoint the basis for the ability of RepC/C but not RepC/C* to initiate replication.
