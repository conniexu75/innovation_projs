https://openalex.org/W2063826393,"FOXO (Forkhead box O) transcription factors induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis, which can be prevented by FOXO phosphorylation by AKT in response to growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). In addition to this well characterized post-translational modification, we showed that FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 were also regulated at the transcriptional level. PDGF, fibroblast growth factors (FGF), and IGF-I repressed the expression of FOXO genes in human fibroblasts. This process was sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibition by LY294002. FOXO1-specific shRNA decreased FOXO1 mRNA expression and enhanced fibroblast proliferation, mimicking the effects of growth factors. Conversely, ectopic FOXO3 activation blocked the proliferation of fibroblasts and induced the expression of FOXO1, FOXO4, and p27-KIP1. Using luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations, we identified a conserved FOXO-binding site in the promoter of the FOXO1 gene, which was required for regulation by PDGF, and mediated the up-regulation of FOXO1 by itself and by FOXO3. Altogether, our results suggest that the expression of FOXO1 and FOXO4 genes is stimulated by FOXO3 and possibly by other FOXO factors in a positive feedback loop, which is disrupted by growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2045911112,"Increasing interest has focused on capturing the complexity of tissues and organs in vitro as models of human pathophysiological processes. In particular, a need exists for a model that can investigate the interactions in three dimensions (3D) between epithelial tissues and a microvascular network since vascularization is vital for reconstructing functional tissues in vitro. Here, we implement a microfluidic platform to analyze angiogenesis in 3D cultures of rat primary hepatocytes and rat/human microvascular endothelial cells (rMVECs/hMVECs). Liver and vascular cells were cultured on each sidewall of a collagen gel scaffold between two microfluidic channels under static or flow conditions. Morphogenesis of 3D hepatocyte cultures was found to depend on diffusion and convection across the nascent tissue. Furthermore, rMVECs formed 3D capillary-like structures that extended across an intervening gel to the hepatocyte tissues in hepatocyte-rMVEC coculture while they formed 2D sheet-like structures in rMVEC monoculture. In addition, diffusion of fluorescent dextran across the gel scaffold was analyzed, demonstrating that secreted proteins from the hepatocytes and MVECs can be exchanged across the gel scaffold by diffusional transport. The experimental approach described here is useful more generally for investigating microvascular networks within 3D engineered tissues with multiple cell types in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1608388154,"Amylin is an endocrine hormone that regulates metabolism. In patients afflicted with type 2 diabetes, amylin is found in fibrillar deposits in the pancreas. Membranes are thought to facilitate the aggregation of amylin, and membrane-bound oligomers may be responsible for the islet β-cell toxicity that develops during type 2 diabetes. To better understand the structural basis for the interactions between amylin and membranes, we determined the NMR structure of human amylin bound to SDS micelles. The first four residues in the structure are constrained to form a hairpin loop by the single disulfide bond in amylin. The last nine residues near the C terminus are unfolded. The core of the structure is an α-helix that runs from about residues 5–28. A distortion or kink near residues 18–22 introduces pliancy in the angle between the N- and C-terminal segments of the α-helix. Mobility, as determined by 15N relaxation experiments, increases from the N to the C terminus and is strongly correlated with the accessibility of the polypeptide to spin probes in the solution phase. The spin probe data suggest that the segment between residues 5 and 17 is positioned within the hydrophobic lipid environment, whereas the amyloidogenic segment between residues 20 and 29 is at the interface between the lipid and solvent. This orientation may direct the aggregation of amylin on membranes, whereas coupling between the two segments may mediate the transition to a toxic structure.

Type 2 diabetes affects over 100 million people worldwide (1Amos A.F. McCarty D.J. Zimmet P. Diabetes Med. 1997; 14: 1-85PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to cost upward of $130 billion dollars a year to treat in the United States alone (2Hogan P. Dall T. Nikolov P. Diabetes Care. 2003; 26: 917-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). The endocrine hormone amylin (also known as islet amyloid polypeptide) appears to have key roles in diabetes pathology (3Cooper G.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Zdrojewicz Z. Belowska-Bién K. Diabetologia Doœswiadczalna i Kliniczna. 2006; 6: 169-172Google Scholar). The normal functions of amylin include the inhibition of glucagon secretion, slowing down the emptying of the stomach, and inducing a feeling of satiety through the actions of the hormone on neurons of the hypothalamus in the brain (5Zdrojewicz Z. Belowska-Bién K. Diabetologia Doœswiadczalna i Kliniczna. 2006; 6: 169-172Google Scholar). The effects of amylin are exerted in concert with those of insulin and reduce the level of glucose in the blood (3Cooper G.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Zdrojewicz Z. Belowska-Bién K. Diabetologia Doœswiadczalna i Kliniczna. 2006; 6: 169-172Google Scholar). Circulating amylin levels increase in a number of pathological conditions, including obesity, syndrome X, pancreatic cancer, and renal failure (3Cooper G.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Amylin levels together with insulin are raised initially in type 2 diabetes but fall as the disease progresses to a stage where the pancreatic islets of Langerhans β-cells that synthesize amylin no longer function (3Cooper G.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, found in 90% of patients, is the formation of extracellular amyloid aggregates composed of amylin (3Cooper G.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 4Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Zdrojewicz Z. Belowska-Bién K. Diabetologia Doœswiadczalna i Kliniczna. 2006; 6: 169-172Google Scholar). The amyloid deposits accumulate in the interstitial fluid between islet cells and are usually juxtaposed with the β-cell membranes (3Cooper G.J. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 163-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Aggregates of amylin are toxic when added to cultures of β-cells, so that the amyloid found in situ may be responsible for β-cell death as type 2 diabetes progresses (6Janson J. Ashley R.H. Harrison D. McIntyre S. Butler P.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 7Lorenzo A. Razzaboni B. Weir G.C. Yankner B.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence that amylin is directly involved in pathology includes a familial S20G mutation that leads to early onset of the disease (8Sakagashira S. Sanke T. Hanabusa T. Shimomura H. Ohagi S. Kumagaye K.Y. Nakajima K. Nanjo K. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1279-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and produces an amylin variant that aggregates more readily (9Ma Z. Westermark G.T. Sakagashira S. Sanke T. Gustavsson A. Sakamoto H. Engstrom U. Nanjo K. Westermark P. Amyloid. 2001; 8: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As with all amyloids it is unclear whether fibrillar structures or soluble oligomers are responsible for pathology. A recurrent theme for amyloidogenic proteins is that toxicity appears to be exerted through membrane-bound oligomers that form pores and disrupt ion balance across membranes (4Jayasinghe S.A. Langen R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 10Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev.

The similar toxic effects exerted by these amyloidogenic molecules may have a common structural and physical basis. Detailed structural models are available for Aβ (16Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A.

For amylin there are models of peptide fragments 1–19 (18Nanga R.P. Brender J.R. Xu J. Veglia G. Ramamoorthy A.

Chemistry. 2007; 13: 10204-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) bound to micelles but as of yet no model of the complete hormone. This turns out to be particularly important as the interplay between structure and dynamics in amylin only comes to light when considering the whole molecule. Here we report the solution structure of human amylin bound to SDS micelles. We complement the structure with information on dynamics and on the immersion of amylin into micelles. Materials—Recombinant human amylin (0.5 mg, lot number 718071NAM) and 15N-amylin (1 mg, lot number 70507) were from rPeptide (Bogart, GA). The peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli and differ from human amylin by not having an amidated C terminus. SDS (electrophoresis grade) was from Bio-Rad. D2O, d25-SDS, d4-acetic acid, d6-methanol, MnCl2, and 16-doxyl-stearic acid were from Aldrich. NMR Sample Preparation—1 mg of 15N-amylin was used for all heteronuclear NMR studies. Sample 1 was prepared by taking up 0.5 mg of lyophilized 15N-amylin powder in a 0.25-ml 90% H2O, 10% D2O solution of 100 mm d25-SDS, 60 mm acetic acid, pH 4.6, to give a final amylin concentration of 0.5 mm. Sample 1 was used for NMR assignments, structure determination and relaxation studies. Sample 2 was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg of amylin into 0.66 ml of the solution described above to give a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Sample 2 was divided into aliquots and used for the paramagnetic quenching studies with Mn2+ and 16-doxyl-stearate. Sample 3 was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg of amylin at natural isotope abundance in 99.96% D2O containing 100 mm SDS, and 60 mm d4-acetate, pH 4.2. An internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid standard was used for chemical shift referencing. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were done on a 600-MHz Varian Inova spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe. Pulse programs were implemented from the Varian ProteinPack. A temperature of 37 °C was used for all experiments. NMR assignments were based on three-dimensional HNHA, HNHB, TOCSY-HSQC (70-ms mixing time), and NOESY-HSQC (100- and 200-ms mixing times) experiments. Spin systems were first grouped by amino acid type using through-bond scalar connectivities. Sequence-specific assignments were then made using dαN and dNN sequential walks (21Wuthrich K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 3340-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using NOESY-HSQC data. Stereospecific assignments for glycine methylene hydrogens were obtained from an HNHB spectrum as described in the literature (22Düx P. Whitehead B. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Vuister G.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments for side chain β-methylene hydrogens were made based on qualitative comparisons of the relative sizes of 3JNHβ couplings in HNHB spectra (23Archer S.J. Ikura M. Torchia D.A. Bax A. J. Magn. Res. 1991; 95: 636-641Google Scholar) and intraresidue HN-Hβ and Hα-Hβ NOEs in short mixing time NOESY experiments (24Case D.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 392-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Assignments for micelle-bound amylin have been deposited with the BMRB under accession number 16105. Structure Determination—A summary of the restraints used to calculate the NMR structures of micelle-bound amylin and of the statistics relating to the qualities of the structures is given in Table 1. Distance restraints were grouped into four ranges (1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–5.5 Å) based on the intensities of cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra. Backbone ϕ angle dihedral restraints of –60 ± 30° were included for 22 residues with 3JHNHα couplings (25Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) smaller than 6 Hz. Side chain χ1 restraints were included for eight residues based on HNHB coupling data and NOE data from short mixing time NOESY experiments (24Case D.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 392-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Statistics for the 30 best micelle-bound amylin structuresaa Values are reported as the means over the final 30 structures ± 1 S.D. These final lowest energy structures had no NOE violations greater than 0.3 Å or dihedral violations greater than 3°.b The energy was calculated using the X-PLOR (26Brunger A.T.

Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-193Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). Standard α-helix hydrogen bond restraints were included for 17 residues with 3JHNHα couplings and Hα secondary shifts in the α-helix range. Of the 17 residues, 8 could be identified in one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra as experiencing hydrogen exchange protection for up to 30 min when amylin was dissolved in d25-SDS micelles suspended in D2O (Thr-9, Gln-10, Leu-12, Ala-13, Leu-16, Leu-27, Ile-26, and Ser-20). For the remaining 9 residues, spectral crowding precluded unambiguous information on exchange protection in one-dimensional spectra. We calculated control structures with hydrogen bond restraints included for only the 8 amides unambiguously protected. These structures showed slightly decreased precision (the backbone r.m.s.d. increased from 1.4 to 1.7 Å for residues 6–27 and from 0.4 to 0.5 Å for residues 6–17). Despite the lower precision, there were no systematic changes in structure, and the NMR ensemble calculated with the full complement of hydrogen bonds fell within the breadth of the conformational ensemble calculated with less hydrogen bonds. We feel that the inclusion of all 17 hydrogen bond restraints is justified by the NOE and 3JHNHa coupling data that support hydrogen-bonded α-helical structures for the residues in question, and by the consistency of the hydrogen bonds with preliminary structures calculated without these restraints. The final NMR structure calculations started from 500 conformations with randomized ϕ,ψ angles. Structures were calculated with the program X-PLOR (version 3.851) (26Brunger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) according to a published protocol (27Gronenborn A.M. Filpula D.R. Essig N.Z. Achari A. Whitlow M. Wingfield P.T. Clore G.M. Science. 1991; 253: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The 30 lowest energy structures with no distance violations greater than 0.3 Å or dihedral violations greater than 3° were kept for analyses. Coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank accession code 2KB8. 15N Relaxation Studies of Amylin Dynamics—15N relaxation data were obtained using 1H-15N correlation experiments from the Varian Protein Pack based on published methods (28Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 868-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Longitudinal relaxation data were obtained from eight spectra collected with T1 relaxation periods of 20, 50, 130, 210, 310, 500, 700, and 1000 ms. To measure time constants for transverse relaxation, eight T2 relaxation periods of 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 150, and 190 ms were used. Pre-acquisition delays of 2 s were used between transients. T1 and T2 values were determined from nonlinear least squares fits of the intensity decay as a function of relaxation period to Equation 1, I=I0⋅exp(−τ/T1,2)(Eq. 1) where I is the intensity for relaxation period τ; I0 is the initial amplitude; and T1,2 is the time constant for either T1 or T2 relaxation. Uncertainties in the T1 and T2 values were taken as the standard errors of the fits. 1H-15N NOE values were calculated as the ratio of intensities in an experiment recorded with proton saturation for 4 s to a control experiment where the saturation period was replaced with an equivalent 4-s delay as shown in Equation 2, NOE=I(s)/I(c)(Eq. 2) Uncertainties in the NOE values were calculated as shown in Equation 3, σ(NOE)=I(s)I(c)(ΔI(s)I(s))2+(ΔI(c)I(c))2(Eq. 3) where ΔI(s) and ΔI(c) indicate the root mean square base-line noise in the spectra with and without saturation (29Alexandrescu A.T. Shortle D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 527-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). S2 order parameters describing the amplitudes of internal motions (30Lipari G. Szabo A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar) were calculated with the program TENSOR 2.0 (31Dosset P. Hus J.C. Blackledge M. Marion D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) assuming isotropic rotational diffusion (17Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43179-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) for the amylin-micelle complex. To obtain a value for the global correlation time for rotational diffusion, we restricted our analysis to residues 5–17, which had 1H-15N NOE values greater than 0.55, 3JHNHα couplings smaller than 6 Hz, and Hα chemical shifts consistent with stable α-helix structure. Using this subset of residues, we obtained a correlation time of 6.7 ns for global tumbling, which was used to calculate S2 values for individual residues. Paramagnetic Studies of Amylin Positioning in SDS Micelles—Separate experiments on 0.2 mm amylin in 100 mm SDS were performed with 16-doxyl-stearate and MnCl2. 16-Doxyl-stearate was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in d6-methanol. The stock solution was used to bring the concentration of sample 2 to 1.85 mm in 16-doxyl-stearate. The aggregation number of SDS micelles is about 60 (32Lindberg M. Jarvet J. Langel U. Graslund A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3141-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), so that a 100 mm SDS solution corresponds to a micelle concentration of 1.85 mm, or 1 spin probe per micelle. In a second experiment the concentration of 16-doxyl-stearate was raised to 9.2 mm corresponding to five spin probes per micelle. Experiments with paramagnetic Mn2+ were done at concentrations of 0.2 and 1 mm MnCl2, corresponding to ratios of 1:1 and 5:1 of the paramagnetic ion to amylin. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were used to measure paramagnetic quenching. For each experiment a separate control experiment was recorded to obtain cross-peak intensities in the absence of paramagnetic agents. CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism experiments were carried out on an Applied Photophysics II*-180 instrument with samples maintained at a temperature of 37 °C. Far-UV wave-length scans from 280 to 180 nm were collected on 250-μl volume samples held in a 1-mm path length cuvette. The samples contained 35 μm amylin in 60 mm acetic acid, pH 4.6, and varying concentrations of SDS. Amylin Adopts an α-Helical Structure in the Presence of SDS Micelles—Although human amylin forms fibrils rapidly in water (33Abedini A. Raleigh D.P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16284-16291Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), it is soluble and stable for at least 2 months in 100 mm SDS at an acidic pH of 4.6. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of amylin under these conditions is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2A shows CD spectra of amylin with increasing concentrations of SDS at pH 4.6. In the absence of SDS, the CD spectrum of amylin looks roughly like that for an unfolded protein. Weak minima at 208 and 222 nm together with the lack of a pronounced minimum at 195 nm, however, are more indicative of a mixture of random coil and nascent α-helix conformations. The nascent α-helix structure in the absence of SDS probably corresponds to that characterized in detail by NMR for unfolded rat amylin (34Williamson J.A. Miranker A.D. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 110-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the presence of 5 mm SDS, there is already significant α-helix structure in the peptide. Under the conditions of our study (37 °C, pH 4.6), the critical micelle concentration of SDS in acetate buffer is about 2 mm (35Paul B.C. Ismail K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1993; 66: 703-708Crossref Google Scholar). As the SDS concentration is raised from 5 to 10 mm, the amount of α-helix structure starts to plateau (Fig. 2A), and there are only small further changes in the CD spectrum between 10 and 100 mm SDS (Fig. 2A). We chose 100 mm SDS for our studies because this value corresponds to a micelle concentration of ∼2 mm (the number of SDS molecules per micelle is expected to be ∼60). Compared with the 0.5 mm amylin concentration, 100 mm SDS ensures an excess of micelles to peptide so that each micelle should have only one molecule of amylin bound. Pulse-field gradient NMR experiments (36Nesmelova I.V. Idiyatullin D. Mayo K.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 166: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) give a diffusion constant for amylin in complex with SDS that within experimental error was the same as that obtained for the complex formed between SDS and Aβ-(1–40), a 40-residue peptide of similar size to the 37-residue amylin (Damylin/DAβ = 0.99 ± 0.06; data not shown). This observation suggests that like Aβ (37Jarvet J. Danielsson J. Damberg P. Oleszczuk M. Graslund A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2007; 39: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), amylin binds to micelles as a monomer at the large 100 mm SDS concentration used for this study. In addition to work at pH 4.6, we also obtained CD data at pH 10.8 in the presence of SDS (not shown). His-18, the only side chain in amylin that titrates in the physiological range, should lose its positive charge between pH 4.6 and 10.8. The CD spectrum between 200 to 280 nm showed very little difference between the two pH values. In the 180–200 nm range, the spectrum at pH 10.8 lacked the large positive band associated with α-helix structure and was noisier, possibly due to light scattering caused by increased aggregation at pH 10.8. Fig. 2B shows the sequence profile of 3JHNHα couplings calculated from an HNHA experiment (25Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Couplings below 6 Hz indicative of ϕ dihedral angles in the α-helix range occur for all residues between 5 and 28, except 18 and 22. On average the group of couplings between residues 5 and 17 is smaller than that for residues 23–28. Fig. 2C shows the difference between random coil values (38Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar) and the Hα chemical shifts of amylin. The secondary shifts for the region between residues 5 and 28 are positive, typical of α-helix structure. The secondary shifts show a periodicity of 3–4 residues, also consistent with α-helix structure (39Jimenez M.A. Blanco F.J. Rico M. Santoro J. Herranz J. Nieto J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 40Wiltscheck R. Kammerer R.A. Dames S.A. Schulthess T. Blommers M.J. Engel J. Alexandrescu A.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Periodicity is also observed for the HN chemical shifts (Fig. 2D), and this type of periodicity has been attributed to α-helix curvature (41McLeish M.J. Nielsen K.J. Najbar L.V. Wade J.D. Lin F. Doughty M.B. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11174-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 42Zhou N.E. Zhu B.-Y. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4320-4326Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The secondary Hα shifts, which are the most sensitive to secondary structure, appear to be on a gradient decreasing from residues 8 to 28 (Fig. 2C). The data suggest a higher stability for α-helix structure in the N-terminal half of amylin. Fig. 2E summarizes the short range NOEs observed for amylin. The NOEs are indicative of α-helix structure. There is a break in the pattern near residues 18–22, consistent with a discontinuity in the α-helix structure. Although there is overlap of HN chemical shifts within this segment (Fig. 1) that precludes the detection of HN-HN NOEs, other types of NOEs predicted for an α-helix structure such as dαN(i,i + 3), dαN(i,i + 4), and dαβ(i,i + 3) are weak or missing. Moreover between residues 5 and 28, His-18 and Asn-22 are the only two sites with 3JHNHα values above 6 Hz, consistent with a departure from α-helix structure in this segment. Although not apparent in the semi-quantitative plot, α-helix NOEs are weaker for the 22–28-residue segment compared with the 5–17-residue segment. NMR Solution Structure of Micelle-bound Amylin—The NMR structure of amylin is shown in Fig. 3. Information on experimental restraints used to calculate the NMR structure ensemble and parameters related to the quality of the structures are given in Table 1. At the N terminus, residues 1-4 are constrained to a hairpin topology by a disulfide bond between Cys-2 and Cys-7. The Cys-7 part of the disulfide is in the α-helix and is ordered, giving a nonaveraged side chain χ1 of –60°. The Cys-2 residue is disordered. The last 8 residues between Thr-30 and Tyr-37 are also disordered. The core of the structure consists of an α-helix running from residues 5 to 28. Most of the members of the NMR ensemble have a kink or bend in the α-helix between residues 18 and 22. When the NMR ensemble is superposed on the mean backbone coordinates of the entire α-helix (residues 6–27), the resulting root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 1.4 Å is rather large (Fig. 3A and Table 1). Consequently, we did a systematic search for residue ranges that would improve the r.m.s.d., and we found that the precision of the structure improves if the segments 6–17 (Fig. 3B) and 18–27 (Fig. 3C) are considered separately. Leaving out segment 18–22 did not improve the fit significantly compared with that obtained for residues 6–27. This indicates that the poor r.m.s.d. when the whole helix is considered is because of an uncoupling of the relative orientations of the 6–17- and 18–27-residue segments rather than disorder in the middle of the helix. We used the MolMol program (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) to calculate a value of 30 ± 18° for the inter-helical angle between segments 6–17 and 18–27. The organization of the micelle-bound amylin structure into subdomains is reminiscent of that seen with αS and the Alzheimer Aβ-(1–40) peptide. In the presence of SDS micelles αS folds into an α-helix hairpin structure (17Ulmer T.S. Bax A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43179-43187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 44Chandra S. Chen X. Rizo J. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The Aβ-(1–40) peptide when bound to SDS micelles adopts an α-helical structure with a kink between residues 26 and 28 (16Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The two helical segments 15–24 and 28–36 flanking the kink superpose well individually but have different orientations relative to each other with an inter-helical angle of 48 ± 15° (16Coles M. Bicknell W. Watson A.A. Fairlie D.P. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11064-11077Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Similarities have been noted in the neurotoxic effects of amylin and Aβ, which may extend to mechanistic similarities (45Lim Y.A. Ittner L.M. Lim Y.L. Gotz J. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2188-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Of the two α-helix segments, residues"
https://openalex.org/W1974515964,"The processive Serratia marcescens chitinases A (ChiA) and B (ChiB) are thought to degrade chitin in the opposite directions. A recent study of ChiB suggested that processivity is governed by aromatic residues in the +1 and +2 (aglycon) subsites close to the catalytic center. To further investigate the roles of aromatic residues in processivity and to gain insight into the structural basis of directionality, we have mutated Trp(167), Trp(275), and Phe(396) in the -3, +1, and +2 subsites of ChiA, respectively, and characterized the hydrolytic activities of the mutants toward beta-chitin and the soluble chitin-derivative chitosan. Although the W275A and F396A mutants showed only modest reductions in processivity, it was almost abolished by the W167A mutation. Thus, although aglycon subsites seem to steer processivity in ChiB, a glycon (-3) subsite seems to be adapted to do so in ChiA, in line with the notion that the two enzymes have different directionalities. Remarkably, whereas all three single mutants and the W167A/W275A double mutant showed reduced efficiency toward chitin, they showed up to 20-fold higher activities toward chitosan. These results show that the processive mechanism is essential for an efficient conversion of crystalline substrates but comes at a large cost in terms of intrinsic enzyme speed. This needs to be taken into account when devising enzymatic strategies for biomass turnover."

The variety of chemical properties of GAG substructures makes it difficult to produce a comprehensive structural measurement with any given technique. As a result, understanding of GAG structural biochemistry is far from complete. It has been demonstrated that the formation of unsubstituted glucosamine amino groups in HS is related to limiting availability of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) during enzymatic N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase reactions (19Carlsson P.

In the absence of PAPS, N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase produces deacetylation of GlcNAc residues of the nascent chain without subsequent N-sulfation.

Free amino-containing disaccharides in glypican-1 HS chains have been found to be susceptible to nitric oxide (NO)-mediated cleavage as part of the regulation of polyamine uptake (28Fransson L.A.

Access to PAPS is likely to vary in different tissue environments. Therefore, it should be possible to directly detect disaccharide units with unsubstituted glucosamine using disaccharide analysis. Lawrence et al. (30Lawrence R. Olson S.K. Steele R.E. Wang L. Warrior R. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33674-33684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) detected an abundant unsulfated N-unsubstituted disaccharide in H. vulgaris and D. melanogaster. N-Unsubstituted disaccharides were of very low abundances in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and mutants thereof and were not reported in porcine intestinal mucosa heparin and mouse embryos. Wei et al. (31Wei Z. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15742-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) determined N-unsubstituted disaccharides in commercial samples to comprise 12% of the total (each ranging from 1.9 to 2.2%) from bovine kidney HS and 1.1% of porcine intestinal mucosa HS. Despite these two recent reports, disaccharides with N-unsubstituted disaccharides have often not been reported from endogenous HS isolated from animal tissues in previous studies. We hypothesize that the chemical properties of the amino group on these glucosamine-containing saccharides limit their detection. Glucosamine amino groups will not be detected by deaminative cleavage following deacetylation of heparin or HS chains. Lyase-generated disaccharides with free amino groups are likely to be less acidic than either N-sulfated or N-acetylated disaccharides, and likely to have a zwitterionic character. Such chemical properties may make free amino-containing disaccharides difficult to detect by traditional chromatographic and electrophoretic approaches to disaccharide analysis. We therefore applied a new system based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with mass spectrometry (MS) detection to the problem of detection of free amino-containing disaccharides and other products of depolymerized HS to show their distributions in different organ tissues. Due to the nonadsorptive chromatographic mechanism, SEC has great potential for non-selective separation of GAG disaccharides (32Ziegler A. Zaia J. J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2006; 837: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Leary group has developed an electrospray ionization-multistage MS platform to profile and quantify HS disaccharides by directly infusing lyase depolymerized HS (33Saad O.M. Ebel H. Uchimura K.

Our laboratory has developed an LC/MS/MS platform to analyze oligosaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfate from connective tissue (35Hitchcock A.M. Yates K.E. Shortkroff S. Costello C.E. Zaia J. Glycobiology. 2006; 17: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 36Hitchcock A. Yates K.E. Costello C. Zaia J. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 1384-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Analysis of GAGs from animal organs, however, is more challenging due to higher fat content and variability in fibrous structure. We therefore developed a general, MS-compatible tissue extraction procedure to enable analysis of organ tissues using SEC LC/MS. The results demonstrate the presence of ΔHexA-GlcNH26S disaccharides that have not been detected previously in studies of HS isolated from mammalian organ tissues or embryos. The levels of this disaccharide depends on the tissue of expression, consistent with the hypothesis that conditions whereby limiting PAPS occurs during HS biosynthesis exist in a variety of tissue contexts. Materials—Heparin lyase I, II, and III from Flavobacterium heparinum were purchased from Ibex Pharmaceuticals (Montreal, Canada). Pronase was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and benzonase was from Sigma. Heparan sulfate disaccharides were from Sigma and V-Labs (Covington, LA). The structure of HS 4,5-(Δ)-disaccharides, together with the nomenclature in this study are shown in Fig. S1. DEAE material packed micro-/macrospin columns were purchased from Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA). The rat organs were obtained from the laboratory of Professor Louis Gerstenfeld (Boston University School of Medicine). GAG Extraction from Tissues—Rat organs were isolated and cut into pieces of less than 2 mm2. Tissue samples were then suspended in distilled water and homogenized. Powder of tissue samples was obtained after lyophilizaton. Dry tissue (∼20 mg) of each organ, in triplicate, was suspended in 0.5 ml of protein digest buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing 0.5 mg of Pronase and incubated for 48 h at 55 °C with end-over-end mixing. A second aliquot of Pronase was added after 20 h. After heat inactivation of the Pronase, the buffer was adjusted to 2 mm MgCl2, and benzonase (300 milliunits) was added. The sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, heat-inactivated, adjusted to a final sodium chloride concentration of 0.1 m, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. For purification of GAGs from tissue digests, macrospin columns (15–30 μg of binding capacity/column) with DEAE resins were used. The columns were saturated by washing with 300 μl of elution buffer (2 m NH4HCO3) and then 3 × 300 μl of loading buffer, pH 8 (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The supernatants of the tissue extracts were applied and allowed to adhere to the column for 10 min. The sample solutions were repipetted through the column once to ensure binding. The columns were washed successively with 6 × 300 μl of loading buffer, 6 × 300 μl of wash buffer, pH 4 (50 mm NaOAc, pH 4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), a 300-μl volume of H2O, and 5 × 300 μl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The elution of GAGs was achieved with 6 × 300 μl of 2 m NH4HCO3. The GAG fraction was collected in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes and lyophilized until no visible salt remained (24–36 h). HS disaccharides may be analyzed in the presence of bulk intact chondroitin sulfate by SEC LC/MS, because these long-chain GAG polysaccharides are well separated from lyase digestion products in this chromatographic mode. Therefore, the GAG pools with both chondroitin sulfate and HS were digested directly with enzymes targeted to the GAG of interest. For the digestion of HS, 20% of the GAG pool was digested with 3.2 milliunits of heparin lyase I, 3.2 milliunits of heparin lyase II, and 1.6 milliunits of heparin lyase III in a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.45, in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The HS digestion was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The digests were analyzed by SEC LC/MS without further treatment. Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry—The Size Exclusion Chromatography column (Superdex™ peptide PC 3.2/30) was purchased from GE Healthcare. For disaccharide analysis, the mobile phase (12.5 mm formate acid, pH adjusted to 4.4 by ammonia, in 10% acetonitrile) was delivered isocratically by a Waters Acquity UltraPerformance LC system at 0.015 ml/min. The LC system was plumbed with 0.025-inch ID Peek tubing. A 2.3-μm filter was placed before the column, as well as a 15 cm × 75 μm inner diameter silica capillary, which generates a reasonable high back pressure to avoid possible generation of bubbles. The high pressure liquid chromatography fraction was monitored simultaneously by a UV (2400 nl, 10-mm light path) detector at 232 nm after the SEC column and before the mass spectrometer. A switch valve was placed before the MS ion source to divert unwanted fractions away from the mass spectrometer. Disaccharides and oligosaccharides eluting from the SEC column were analyzed using an Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar-I (Q-ToF) mass spectrometer operating in negative ion mode. The ionization of the LC flow was accomplished by a TurboIonSpray source with nebulizer gas set at 50, curtain gas at 25, turbo gas at 0, and the sprayer position optimized to give least sulfate loss for ΔHexA2S-GlcNS6S standard (<15%). GAG Extraction and Purification—The methods developed in the present study were aimed to illustrate and characterize the structural diversities of GAGs in mammalian organ tissue samples with increased depth of coverage of rare but functionally important substructures. We used Pronase digestion to cleave the protein backbone and at the same time isolate the GAG chain from the protein core of the proteoglycans. This procedure combines protein digestion and GAG isolation in one pot and is therefore time-saving. These studies targeted di- and oligosaccharides generated by exhaustive lyase digestion. In future work, a β-elimination step via alkaline sodium boro-hydride will be added to release the linker oligosaccharide from the peptide backbone to enable the detection of the linker domain. In the pivotal DEAE weak ion exchange steps, commercially available spin columns were adopted in place of the traditional gravity columns used in previous studies. This modification greatly facilitates ion exchange chromatography and increases the throughput by utilizing a centrifuge that can run up to 16 samples at one time. The inclusion of detergent (Triton X-100) in the Pronase digestion (1%) and DEAE workup step (0.1%) eliminated the need for organic solvent extraction without causing interference by fat and lipids in the mass spectrometry experiments. This is echoed by the miniscale GAG extraction protocol of Ledin et al. (16Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As part of an MS-compatible procedure, it is important to remove ammonium salts by thorough lyophilization as an improvement to the repetitive drying in a centrifugal vacuum concentrator in the original procedure. The lyase digest solutions were analyzed by SEC with direct electrospray ionization-MS detection. SEC LC/MS Analysis of Native HS Disaccharides—SEC has advantages for disaccharide analysis over adsorption chromatographic modes (32Ziegler A. Zaia J. J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2006; 837: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Hitchcock A.M. Yates K.E. Shortkroff S. Costello C.E. Zaia J. Glycobiology. 2006; 17: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 38Zaia J. McClellan J.E. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 6030-6039Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The disaccharides are separated based on hydrodynamic volume, roughly proportional to the number of sulfate groups present. Because SEC is a nonadsorptive chromatography mode, there are no concerns about losses of weakly absorbed disaccharide compositions. For the same reason, oligosaccharides are not bound to the column, and extensive column cleaning and maintenance steps are not necessary. There is no mobile phase gradient in SEC mode; hence, the electrospray conditions are constant for all di- and oligosaccharide chains eluting from the column. In addition, the mobile phase conditions do not have to be optimized for different sizes or compositions of oligosaccharides. The pH value of the mobile phase was adjusted to 4.4 to allow the ionization of the GAGs but not for weaker acids. The salt of the buffer was ammonium formate, which is volatile and widely used in LC/MS. The concentration was selected to be relatively low at 12.5 mm so that it can provide minimal background MS signals but does not affect the chromatographic separations significantly. The SEC resolution is maximized at 15 μl/min according to a van Deemter curve that has been measured for GAGs (32Ziegler A. Zaia J. J. Chromatogr. B Anal. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2006; 837: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This flow rate produces acceptable analysis times for HS lyase digestion products. Extracted ion chromatograms for Δ-unsaturated and saturated disaccharide digestion products are shown in Fig. 1. An example mass spectrum (shown in Fig. S2) summed from 96 to 105 min of the SEC LC/MS total ion chromatogram from HS digest of rat brain tissues shows a series of Δ-unsaturated and saturated disaccharides. The relative quantities of eight chromatographically separated HS disaccharides extracted from the LC-mass spectral data are shown in Fig. 2. The plot compares HS Δ-disaccharide profiles corresponding to nonsulfated ΔHexA-GlcNAc, singly sulfated ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S), doubly sulfated ΔHexA2S-GlcNAc6S, singly sulfated ΔHexA-GlcNS, doubly sulfated ΔHexA(2S)-GlcNS (6S), and triply sulfated ΔHexA2S-GlcNS6S among seven rat tissues: brain, muscle, liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and lung. The relatively small error bars from triplicate experiments enable significant differences in disaccharide abundances to be observed among the different tissues. In addition, these data allow calculation of HS N-acetylation and N-sulfation (Fig. S3) and the average number of sulfate groups per 100 disaccharide units (Fig. 3). These characteristics reflect the overall HS chain composition as expressed in the tissue sample. Such values have potential as important indicators of aging, disease, or other biological transformations. Similar profiling of HS disaccharides from different mammalian tissues by other detection platforms, such as reverse phase ion pairing and strong anion exchange, coupled with radioactivity and fluorescence have been reported (16Ledin J.

The SEC LC/MS data overall parallel the disaccharide profiles of previously reported HS from murine organs and embryos. However, a detailed comparison based on these cross-platform data that were not calibrated and normalized to absolute quantities was not attempted. In addition, the animals used in these studies were of different species (rats versus mice) and of different or unspecified genders, ages, or development stages.FIGURE 2HS disaccharide profiles in rat tissues analyzed by SEC LC/MS. The percentage of disaccharides of total digest abundance was as follows: heart, 95.7%; kidney, 92.5%; lung, 96.2%; spleen, 91.4%; brain, 84.9%; liver, 95.3%; muscle, 96.1%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3The average number of sulfations per 100 dp2s among rat tissues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The SEC LC/MS data show the presence of both Δ-unsaturated disaccharides from the internal portion of the HS chain and saturated disaccharides from the nonreducing end (Fig. 2). The abundances of the saturated and Δ-unsaturated disaccharide are very useful, since they provide a way to calculate the average chain lengths by dividing the total numbers of disaccharides with the numbers of saturated disaccharides (41Calabro A. Midura R. Wang A. West L. Plaas A. Hascall V.C. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2001; 9: 16-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The calculated values, shown in Fig. 4, indicate significant variations in chain length among the different tissues. The HS chain length is likely to result from factors including expression of biosynthetic enzymes and availability of nucleotide sugar precursors transported through the Golgi apparatus (42Berninsone P.M. Hirschberg C.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition, heparanases may degrade HS in a tissue-specific manner, shortening the observed chain lengths (43Vlodavsky I. Goldshmidt O. Zcharia E. Atzmon R. Rangini-Guatta Z. Elkin M. Peretz T. Friedmann Y. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2002; 12: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, the differences of the average chain lengths among different tissues may be a reflection of how the expression of the genes of these enzymes differs in different organ tissues. The average chain lengths in the seven organ tissues range from 30 to 60 disaccharide units, which corresponds to a molecular mass of 12–24 kDa. Another interesting value that may be calculated is the percentage of each of the saturated disaccharides of the total number of the saturated disaccharides. This percentage is also the probability that a particular disaccharide appears at the nonreducing end. This distribution is shown in Fig. 5. Comparing Figs. 2 and 5, it can be seen that HexA-GlcNS and HexA (2S)-GlcNS (6S) have higher probabilities of locating at the nonreducing end than in the whole chain. HexA-GlcNS, and to a lesser degree, HexA (2S)-GlcNS (6S) (except for brain and muscle) are overall most likely to be the nonreducing end disaccharides. This finding is consistent with the previous report that the nonreducing end of bovine kidney HS are heavily sulfated and especially N-sulfated (44Wu Z.L. Lech M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33749-33755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, there is no observable relationship of the occurrence of one particular dp2 relating to the chain length. When the total chain sulfation degree versus the chain lengths and the nonreducing end sulfation degree versus the chain lengths were plotted, there is a pattern that more sulfated HS tends to be shorter (Fig. S4, A and B). When the percentages in Fig. 5 are divided by percentages in Fig. 3, the resulting value indicates whether a certain disaccharide is more or less likely to be at the reducing end, as shown in Fig. 6. A positive value on the logarithmic scale indicates that the particular disaccharide"

We used x-ray crystallography and biochemical analysis of the human DEXD/H-box protein DDX19 to investigate its regulatory mechanism. The crystal structures of DDX19, in its RNA-bound prehydrolysis and free posthydrolysis state, reveal an α-helix that inserts between the conserved domains of the free protein to negatively regulate ATPase activity. This finding was corroborated by biochemical data that confirm an autoregulatory function of the N-terminal region of the protein.

This is the first study describing crystal structures of a DEXD/H-box protein in its open and closed cleft conformations. RNA helicase activity is involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism, including transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, nuclear export, translation initiation and termination, RNA degradation, viral replication, and viral RNA detection. The DEXD/H-box RNA helicases couple hydrolysis of ATP to cycles of RNA binding and release that typically result in non-processive RNA duplex unwinding (1Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 2194-2206Google Scholar) or disruption of RNP 3The abbreviations used are: RNP, ribonucleoprotein; ADPNP, adenosine 5′-(β, γ-imido)triphosphate; ssRNA, single-stranded RNA; PDB, Protein Data Bank; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine; Bis-Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. complexes (2Jankowsky E.

These proteins interact in a non-sequence-specific manner with the phosphoribose backbone of single-stranded RNA. DEXD/H-box RNA helicases contain two α/β-RecA-like domains that both feature conserved sequence motifs involved in RNA binding and ATP hydrolysis (4Cordin O. Banroques J. Tanner N.K. Linder P.

Accessory proteins are involved in the regulation of RNA binding and ATPase activities, although no general mechanism has been demonstrated. The DDX19 member of the DEXD/H-box RNA helicase family performs an essential function in mRNA nuclear export by remodeling RNP particles during passage of mRNA through the nuclear pore complex (3Tran E.J.

Science.. 2007; 315: 646-649Google Scholar). A specific function has been assigned to the ADP-bound form of Dbp5, which displaces the RNA-binding protein Nab2, an event that is required for mRNA export (3Tran E.J. Zhou Y. Corbett A.H. Wente S.R. Mol. Cell.. 2007; 28: 850-859Google Scholar). In vivo, Dbp5 is activated by the nuclear pore complex-associated protein, Gle1 (11Murphy R. Wente S.R.

DEXD/H-box helicases in general share little homology in their coding sequences upstream of the conserved domain-1. The N-terminal extension of DDX19, however, shares significant homology with that of DDX25/GRTH, a testis-specific protein that is essential for spermatogenesis (18Dufau M.L. Tsai-Morris C.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab... 2007; 18: 314-320Google Scholar), supporting a functional significance for this sequence. Herein, we present a crystal structure of human DDX19 that shows the ADP-bound protein with an α-helical segment of the N-terminal extension wedged between the core domains, preventing cleft closure. In the structure of the ADPNP-bound protein in complex with RNA, this α-helix has moved out of the way to allow formation of a functional ATPase site. Our biochemical evidence supports a model for DDX19 autoregulation where the N-terminal extension helix prevents ATP hydrolysis, unless the N terminus of the protein is displaced by RNA binding, allowing cleft closure to bring key side chains into position for catalysis. Human DDX19 cDNA was obtained from the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC; accession number BC003626) provided by the National Institute of Health. The sequences encoding DDX191–479 (full-length protein), DDX1954–475, and DDX1992–475 were amplified by PCR and inserted into pNIC28-Bsa4 by ligation-independent cloning. The expression constructs included a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Protein expression in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (DDX191–479), BL21(DE3) gold pRARE2 (DDX1954–475), or BL21(DE3) R3 pRARE (DDX1992–475) was done in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with 8 g/liter glycerol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin, induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and culture at 18 °C for 20 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm TCEP, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by a freeze/thaw cycle followed by the addition of benzonase (Novagen) and sonication (Sonics VibraCell). Cleared and filtered lysates were loaded onto HiTrap chelating HP columns (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer 1 (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm TCEP). The columns were washed with buffer 1 containing 25 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with buffer 1 containing 500 mm imidazole and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer 2 (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm TCEP). Fractions containing DDX19 protein were pooled, and the concentration of TCEP was adjusted to 2 mm. The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was removed by incubation of DDX19 proteins with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease at a molar ratio of 30:1 overnight at room temperature and subsequent passage over a 1-ml HisTrap HP column in buffer 1. The ADP-bound DDX19 apoenzyme structure (PDB entry 3EWS) was obtained with uncleaved protein. The purified proteins were concentrated into buffer 2 using Vivaspin (Sartorius) centrifugal concentrators. Aliquots were flash-frozen and stored at –80 °C. All proteins were verified by time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis. For the ADP-bound DDX1954–475 enzyme (PDB entry 3EWS), needle-like crystals of DDX19 were grown using vapor diffusion at 4 °C by mixing 0.1 μl of protein solution (18.3 mg/ml) including 20 mm ADP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 μl of reservoir solution containing 17% polyethylene glycol 10000, 0.1 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 5.5. Crystals appeared after 8 days and continued to grow for one more week. Reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol was used as cryo-solution and added directly to the drop. Crystals were mounted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to 2.7 Å resolution were collected at Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (BESSY), Berlin, Germany (beamline BL14-2). Data were processed with XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr... 1993; 26: 795-800Google Scholar). The structure was solved by Phaser (20McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

Domains were searched for separately and were edited according to sequence alignment with CHAINSAW (21Stein N. J. Appl. Crystallogr... 2008; 40: 641-643Google Scholar) before molecular replacement. The structure was refined with Phenix (22Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J. Sacchettini J.C. Sauter N.K. Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr.

Crystals of DDX1954–475 in complex with RNA and Mg-ADPNP were obtained by vapor diffusion in sitting drops incubated at 4 °C by mixing 0.1 μl of protein solution (20 mg/ml) including 10-molar excess of decauracil ssRNA, ADPNP, and MgCl2 and 0.2 μl of reservoir solution containing 14% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000, 0.25 m trimethylamine n-oxide, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8. Crystals appeared after 7 days. Reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol was used as cryosolution and added directly to the drop. Crystals were mounted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to 2.7 Å resolution were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) Grenoble, France (beamline ID-29). Data were integrated and scaled using XDS. One monomer was located in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by Phaser using the previous DDX19 structure (PDB entry 3EWS) as a search model. Domains were searched for separately. The structure was refined with RefMac5 (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). TLS parameters were refined using individual domains as rigid groups. Model building was done using Coot. For further details, see supplemental Table S1. Geometry of the models was analyzed with Molprobity (25Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall W.B. III, de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins.. 2003; 50: 437-450Google Scholar) Sequence alignments were obtained using ESPript (26Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Metoz F. Bioinformatics (Oxf.).. 1999; 15: 305-308Google Scholar). The figures were created using Pymol (27DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA. 2002; Google Scholar). ATPase activities of the DDX19 protein constructs (0.5 μm; in 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 2 mm TCEP) were measured using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen) at 22 °C. The assay was performed in either the presence or the absence of RNA (poly(U) RNA or poly(I)-poly(C) (Sigma-Aldrich)) and in the presence and absence of 250 units of benzonase (Merck). All presented data represent means ± S.D. of five independent determinations. In an effort to determine the mechanism of DDX19 action and of its regulation, we determined the crystal structures of human DDX19 (residues Glu54–Glu475, encompassing the two conserved domains) as a complex with ADP and as a ternary complex with ADPNP and RNA (Fig. 1; see supplemental Table S1 for details of data collection and refinement statistics). Both structures revealed the canonical DEXD/H-box RNA helicase N-terminal ATPase and C-terminal helicase domains in the typical arrangement, with the two domains coming together to form the nucleotide binding cleft. The structure of RNA-free DDX19 bound to ADP revealed a surprising feature (Fig. 1A). The section Asp55–Ser68 of the N-terminal extension, which was partly disordered in the RNA complex, folded into an α-helix that occupied the central cleft between the two lobes. The helix extended from the RNA binding site at its N terminus to the nucleotide binding site, where it contacted the phosphate groups of ADP (Fig. 1, B and E). The helix is predicted to disrupt the ATP binding site as it displaces the arginine finger (Arg429) that is essential for the ATPase reaction to occur (Fig. 1, A, C, E, and F) (6Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 4332-4347Google Scholar, 28Le Hir H. Andersen G.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 2008; 18: 112-119Google Scholar). A similar placement of a secondary structural element has never been observed in a DEXD/H-box protein. The Asp55–Ser68 α-helix makes a significant number of side chain interactions with both conserved domains (Fig. 1B). The loop leading out of the C terminus of the α-helix hydrogen bonds with two hydroxyls of the nucleotide ribose (the backbone amide of Asn69 with the 3′ hydroxyl and the backbone amide of Leu70 with the ring oxygen), suggesting selective binding to nucleotides at that site (Fig. 1, B and E). The significance of these interactions is supported by the conservation of the sequence of this N-terminal flanking segment, as well as the side chains it makes contacts with, in the DEXD/H-box RNA helicase, DDX25/GRTH (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). The structure of the ternary complex with a decauracil (U10) mRNA mimic and the non-hydrolyzable nucleotide, ADPNP, shows that both lobes contribute to nucleotide and RNA binding (Fig. 1C, D, and F and supplemental Fig. S2). Six bases of the RNA molecule are visible in the electron density, positioned across the top of the cleft; this mode of binding is consistent with the mechanism of RNA binding predicted for other DEXD/H-box RNA helicases, as determined by the structures of the complexes of RNA with DDX48/elF4AIII (12Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Flick J.S. Berger J.M. Thorner J. Weis K. Nature Cell Biol... 2006; 8: 668-676Google Scholar, 13Sengoku T. Nureki O. Nakamura A. Satoru K.I. Yokoyama S. Cell.. 2006; 125: 287-300Google Scholar) and Vasa (14Bono F. Ebert J. Lorentzen E. Conti E. Cell.. 2006; 126: 713-725Google Scholar). Also common to the mechanisms of the DEXD/H-box RNA helicase interactions with RNA is a kink that the proteins introduce in the RNA backbone between U4 and U5. DDX19 differs from DDX48 and Vasa in the binding to RNA downstream of the kink. In the DDX48 and Vasa structures, U5 and U6 remain stacked with each other on the 3′ side of the kink, whereas in DDX19, the U6 base is rotated through ∼150 degrees around the sugar-phosphate backbone (Fig. 1D). This conformation is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the 2′-ribose hydroxyl of U6 and the ϵ-amide of Lys227 and between the uracil base and the Lys202 and Asp223 side chains. Structure overlays suggest that a similar flipped conformation of U6 could not be accommodated by either DDX48 or Vasa. The interactions of the cleft-inserted helix with the conserved domains and with the nucleotide attest to the specificity and selectivity of the positioning of the N-terminal extension and point to a potential regulatory mechanism for the intrinsic ATPase activity of DDX19 (Fig. 1, B and E). To investigate this possibility, we measured the ATPase activities of three different DDX19 protein constructs (Fig. 2A). In the absence of ssRNA, full-length DDX19 (Met1–Asn479) did not hydrolyze appreciable amounts of ATP, but ATPase activity was stimulated to a rate of ∼0.77 ± 0.2 min–1 (S.D.) by 0.5 mg/ml ssRNA (Fig. 2B). The shorter protein construct Glu54–Glu475, lacking the native N terminus but containing the cleft insertion helix, hydrolyzed ATP at an intermediate rate of ∼25% of the ssRNA-stimulated full-length protein. This activity was independent of the presence of ssRNA. The construct Lys92–Glu475, which also lacked the cleft insertion α-helix, displayed the highest turnover of ATP (∼200% of the ssRNA-stimulated full-length protein), again independent of the presence of ssRNA. Further tests showed that the ATPase activities of the DDX19 proteins were not stimulated nor inhibited by the presence of double-stranded RNA (supplemental Fig. S3). Taken together, these results show that the core DEAD and helicase domains (construct Lys92–Glu475) form an active, RNA-independent ATPase. The addition of the cleft-inserted helix (construct Glu54–Glu475) represses the ATPase activity of the core protein but does not confer RNA dependence to it. Further addition of the native N terminus (i.e. resulting in full-length DDX19) completely abolishes the ATPase activity of the protein in the absence of ssRNA. The presence of ssRNA overcomes the complete inhibition of ATPase activity in the full-length protein. The presence of the native N terminus is also required for ssRNA concentration-dependent stimulation of ATPase activity, indicating that ssRNA binding is sufficient to displace the N terminus, release the helix from the cleft, and allow formation of the catalytic triad in the ATP binding site. RNA- and ATP-induced cleft closure has been shown to occur in solution (29Theissen B. Karow A.R. Kohler J. Gubaev A. Klostermeier D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2008; 105: 548-553Google Scholar), and the crystal structures of human DDX19 presented here demonstrate how cleft closure can be utilized in the regulation of ATPase activity. Our results suggest a model where an α-helical segment of the N-terminal flanking region is inserted between the core domains in the RNA-free protein. This helix prevents cleft closure and positions the N-terminal flanking sequence in the RNA binding groove or in its proximity. RNA binding then displaces the native N terminus, releasing the helix from the cleft to allow formation of the closed state and subsequent nucleotide hydrolysis. We predict that this mechanism of autoregulation also applies to DDX25, the other DEXD/H-helicase in which the sequence of the cleft insertion helix is highly conserved, and possibly to other family members.

https://openalex.org/W2060535020,"The transcriptional factor FoxO1 plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis. Herein we identify a novel transrepressional function that converts FoxO1 from an activator of transcription to a promoter-specific repressor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) target genes that regulate adipocyte biology. FoxO1 transrepresses PPARgamma via direct protein-protein interactions; it is recruited to PPAR response elements (PPRE) on PPARgamma target genes by PPARgamma bound to PPRE and interferes with promoter DNA occupancy of the receptor. The FoxO1 transrepressional function, which is independent and dissectible from the transactivational effects, does not require a functional FoxO1 DNA binding domain, but dose require an evolutionally conserved 31 amino acids LXXLL-containing domain. Insulin induces FoxO1 phosphorylation and nuclear exportation, which prevents FoxO1-PPARgamma interactions and rescues transrepression. Adipocytes from insulin resistant mice show reduced phosphorylation and increased nuclear accumulation of FoxO1, which is coupled to lowered expression of endogenous PPARgamma target genes. Thus the innate FoxO1 transrepression function enables insulin to augment PPARgamma activity, which in turn leads to insulin sensitization, and this feed-forward cycle represents positive reinforcing connections between insulin and PPARgamma signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2008700377,"The mitochondrial dimeric phospholipid cardiolipin is characterized by a high degree of unsaturation of its acyl chains, which is important for its functional interaction with mitochondrial enzymes. The unusual fatty acid composition of cardiolipin molecular species emerges from a de novo synthesized ""premature"" species by extensive acyl chain remodeling that involves as yet only partially identified acyltransferases and phospholipases. Recently, the yeast protein Taz1p was shown to function as a transacylase, which catalyzes the reacylation of monolysocardiolipin to mature cardiolipin. A defect in the orthologous human TAZ gene is associated with Barth syndrome, a severe genetic disorder, which may lead to cardiac failure and death in childhood. We now identified the protein encoded by reading frame YGR110W as a mitochondrial phospholipase, which deacylates de novo synthesized cardiolipin. Ygr110wp has a strong substrate preference for palmitic acid residues and functions upstream of Taz1p, to generate monolysocardiolipin for Taz1p-dependent reacylation with unsaturated fatty acids. We therefore rename the Ygr110wp as Cld1p (cardiolipin-specific deacylase 1)."
https://openalex.org/W2001703869,"Post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure is a major public health problem in Western countries and results from ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced cell death, remodeling, and contractile dysfunction. Ex vivo studies have demonstrated the cardioprotective anti-inflammatory effect of the cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor agonists within hours after IR. Herein, we evaluated the in vivo effect of CB2 receptors on IR-induced cell death, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction and investigated the target role of cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. The infarct size was increased 24 h after IR in CB2 /_ vs. wild-type (WT) hearts and decreased when WT hearts were injected with the CB2 agonist JWH133 (3 mg/kg) at reperfusion. Compared with WT hearts, CB2–/– hearts showed widespread injury 3 d after IR, with enhanced apoptosis and remodeling affecting the remote myocardium. Finally, CB2 –/– hearts exhibited exacerbated fibrosis, associated with left ventricular dysfunction 4 wk after IR, whereas their WT counterparts recovered normal function. Cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts isolated from CB2 –/– hearts displayed a higher H2O2- induced death than WT cells, whereas 1 μM JWH133 triggered survival effects. Furthermore, H2O2-induced myofibroblast activation was increased in CB2 –/– fibroblasts but decreased in 1 μM JWH133-treated WT fibroblasts, compared with that in WT cells. Therefore, CB2 receptor activation may protect against post-IR heart failure through direct inhibition of cardiac myocyte and fibroblast death and prevention of myofibroblast activation.—Defer, N.,Wan, J., Souktani, R., Escoubet, B., Perier, M., Caramelle, P., Manin, S., Deveaux, V., Bourin, M.-C., Zimmer, A., Lotersztajn, S., Pecker, F., Pavoine, C.

https://openalex.org/W2105425843,"Recent studies indicate that neonatal spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) possess pluripotency. However, the mechanisms that regulate the pluripotent differentiation capacity of SSCs remain unclear. Here, we describe a new method to clonally derive pluripotent SSCs from neonatal mouse testis. By coculturing with testicular stromal cells, SSCs can be maintained and expanded in serum-free conditions. Unlike endogenous SSCs, these in vitro expanded SSCs showed strong alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and displayed characteristics of embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells, which were therefore designated as AP(+) germline stem cells (AP(+)GSCs). The pluripotency of AP(+)GSCs was confirmed by in vitro differentiation toward hepatic and neuronal lineages and formation of embryonic chimeras after injection into blastocysts. Further investigation revealed that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secreted from Leydig cells was a key factor involved in maintaining the pluripotency of AP(+)GSCs. The blockage of IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation and its downstream PI3K pathway by PPP or LY294002 dramatically reduced their AP activity and expression of pluripotent genes, such as Oct-4, Blimp1, and Nanog. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that IGF-1 secreted by testicular Leydig cells plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotency of SSCs in culture, which provides an insight into the molecular mechanism underlying germ cell pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2088403686,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a principal enzyme responsible for the clearance of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins from the bloodstream. Two members of the Angptl (angiopoietin-like protein) family, namely Angptl3 and Angptl4, have been shown to inhibit LPL activity in vitro and in vivo. Here, we further investigated the structural basis underlying the LPL inhibition by Angptl3 and Angptl4. By multiple sequence alignment analysis, we have identified a highly conserved 12-amino acid consensus motif that is present within the coiled-coil domain (CCD) of both Angptl3 and Angptl4, but not other members of the Angptl family. Substitution of the three polar amino acid residues (His46, Gln50, and Gln53) within this motif with alanine abolishes the inhibitory effect of Angptl4 on LPL in vitro and also abrogates the ability of Angptl4 to elevate plasma triglyceride levels in mice. The CCD of Angptl4 interacts with LPL and converts the catalytically active dimers of LPL to its inactive monomers, whereas the mutant protein with the three polar amino acids being replaced by alanine loses such a property. Furthermore, a synthetic peptide consisting of the 12-amino acid consensus motif is sufficient to inhibit LPL activity, although the potency is much lower than the recombinant CCD of Angptl4. In summary, our data suggest that the 12-amino acid consensus motif within the CCD of Angptl4, especially the three polar residues within this motif, is responsible for its interaction with and inhibition of LPL by blocking the enzyme dimerization.

Irvine S.A. Ramji D.P. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 753-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 2Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a major role in maintaining lipid homeostasis by promoting the clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins from the bloodstream. Abnormality in LPL functions has been associated with a number of pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia associated with diabetes, and Alzheimer disease (1Mead J.R. Irvine S.A. Ramji D.P. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 753-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). LPL is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, particularly in adipocytes and myocytes (2Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). As a rate-limiting enzyme for clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins, the activity of LPL is tightly modulated by multiple mechanisms in a tissue-specific manner in response to nutritional changes (3Otarod J.K. Goldberg I.J. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2004; 6: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Enerback S. Semb H. Tavernier J. Bjursell G. Olivecrona T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 64: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of LPL in adipose tissue is enhanced after feeding to facilitate the storage of TG, whereas it is down-regulated during fasting to increase the utilization of TG by other tissues (5Doolittle M.H. Ben-Zeev O. Elovson J. Martin D. Kirchgessner T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4570-4577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active form of LPL is a noncovalent homodimer with the subunits associated in a head-to-tail manner, and the dissociation of its dimeric form leads to the formation of a stable inactive monomeric conformation and irreversible enzyme inactivation (6Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). At the post-translational level, the LPL activity is regulated by numerous apolipoprotein co-factors. For instance, apoCII, a small apolipoprotein consisting of 79 amino acid residues in human, activates LPL by directly binding to the enzyme (7Vainio P. Virtanen J.A. Kinnunen P.K. Voyta J.C.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3433-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By contrast, several other apolipoproteins such as apoCI, apo-CIII, and apoE have been shown to inhibit the LPL activity in vitro (3Otarod J.K. Goldberg I.J. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2004; 6: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Angiopoietin-like proteins (Angptl) are a family of secreted proteins consisting of seven members, Angptl1 to Angptl7 (9Katoh Y. Katoh M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 17: 1145-1149PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2006; 17: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All the members of the Angptl family share a similar domain organization to those of angiopoietins, with an NH2-terminal coiled-coil domain (CCD) and a COOH-terminal fibrinogen-like domain. Among the seven family members, only Angptl3 and Angptl4 have been shown to be involved in regulating triglyceride metabolism (10Li C. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2006; 17: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Kersten S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The biological functions of Angptl3 in lipid metabolism were first discovered by Koishi et al. (12Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) in their positional cloning of the recessive mutation gene responsible for the hypolipidemia phenotype in a strain of obese mouse KK/snk. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that Angptl3 increases plasma TG levels by inhibiting the LPL enzymatic activity (13Fujimoto K. Koishi R. Shimizugawa T. Ando Y. Exp.

In addition to its role in regulating angiogenesis, a growing body of evidence demonstrated that Angptl4 is an important player of lipid metabolism (10Li C. Curr. Opin.

Notably, treatment of several mouse models (such as C57BL/6J, ApoE–/–, LDLR–/–, and db/db obese/diabetic mice) with a neutralizing antibody against Angptl4 recapitulate the lipid phenotype found in Angptl4 knock-out mice (19Desai U.

The role of Angptl4 as a physiological inhibitor of LPL is also supported by the finding that its expression levels in adipose tissue change rapidly during the fed-to-fasting transitions and correlate inversely with LPL activity (23Sukonina V.

Angptl4 inhibits LPL by promoting the conversion of the catalytically active LPL dimers into catalytically inactive LPL monomers, thereby leading to the inactivation of LPL (23Sukonina V. Lookene A.

However, the detailed structural and molecular basis underlying the LPL inhibition by Angptl3 and Angptl4 remain poorly characterized at this stage. In this study, we analyzed all known amino acid sequences of Angptl3 and Angptl4 from various species and found a short motif, LAXGLLXLGXGL (where X represents polar amino acid residues), which corresponds to amino acid residues 46–57 and 44–55 of human Angptl3 and Angptl4, respectively, is highly conserved despite the low degree of their overall homology (∼30%). Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrated that this 12-amino acid sequence motif, in particular the three polar amino acid residue within this motif, is essential for mediating the interactions between LPL and Angpt4, which in turn disrupts the dimerization of the enzyme. Materials—Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). T4 DNA ligase and ImProm-II™ Reverse Transcription System were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Cell culture media, fetal bovine serum, and cloning vector pPROEx-Htb were obtained from Invitrogen. All oligonucleotide primers used for cloning and mutagenesis were synthesized by Techdragon Co. (Hong Kong, China). PS20 ProteinChip® array and all PCRs were performed with iProof High Fidelity PCR system from Bio-Rad. QIAprep™ miniprep kit, QIAquick™ gel extraction kit, and Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity gel beads were from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-codon plus RILP-competent cell was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Human recombinant Angptl3-CCD was kindly provided by the Biovendor Laboratory Medicine, Inc. (Modrice, Czech Republic). Intralipid 10% emulsion (soybean triacylglycerol emulsified in egg yolk phospholipids) was from KABI-Fresenius (Uppsala, Sweden). [3H]Triolein was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, purified bovine LPL, sinapinic acid, and the synthetic peptides were from Sigma. 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Detoxi-Gel™ endotoxin removing gel was from Pierce. Plasmid Construction—The first strand cDNA for human Angptl4-CCD was prepared by reverse transcription PCR of total RNA extracted from HepG2 cells using primers as listed in supplemental Table 1. Restriction endonuclease cleavage sites SalI and XhoI were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified fragment, respectively. The fragment was subcloned into pPROEX-HTb bacterial expression vector, which generated an in-frame fusion with an NH2-terminal His6 tag. The construct was verified by DNA sequencing and was used for the production of recombinant protein as well as the template for subsequent site-directed mutagenesis. All the mutants were generated by overlapping PCR mutagenesis using the oligonucleotide primers listed in supplemental Table 1. The restriction site at the 5′ end was changed to StylI instead of SalI after amplification using the 5′ primer “hA4-F-StyI” by the iProof High Fidelity PCR system following the manufacturer's instruction for the GC-rich conditions. The purified gene fragments were digested and cloned into pPROEX-HTb vector digested with StyI and XhoI, and the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis as described above. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Angptl4-CCD—The constructs encoding either wild type human Angptl4-CCD or its variants were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)-codon plus RILP-competent cells for protein expression as described (32Xu A. Lam M.C. Chan K.W. Wang Y. Zhang J. Hoo R.L. Xu J.Y. Chen B. Chow W.S. Tso A.W. Lam K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6086-6091Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and lysed by pulsed sonication in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol (pH 6.5). After removing the debris by centrifugation, the lysates were loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The wild type or mutated hAngptl4-CCD was eluted with 150 mm imidazole after extensive washing, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5). Endotoxin was removed by Detoxi-Gel™ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lipase Activity Assay—LPL activity was measured using a [3H]triolein-incorporated phospholipid emulsion of soybean triacylglycerols (10% Intralipid®) as described (33Bergo M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All the reactions were performed using fetal calf serum as a source of apo-CII unless otherwise stated. The reaction mix (100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with gentle shaking. Free fatty acids, the main product of the reaction, were extracted by Dole's extraction method (34Rimmer A.D. Schonbaum E. Carroll K.K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1962; 7: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of Dole's solution (isopropyl alcohol:heptane: H2SO4, 40:48.3:1, v/v), 0.25 ml of H2O was added and mixed vigorously by vortexing. Following separation of the two phases by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, 0.4 ml of upper layer was transferred to another fresh tube containing a 0.5-ml solution of alkaline ethanol (50% ethanol in 50 mm NaOH). Triacylglycerols were extracted twice by addition of 3 ml of heptane followed by vigorously mixing and phase separation. The amount of [3H]oleic acid in the lower aqueous phase was measured by determining the radioactivity using Liquid Scintillation Analyzer TRI-CARB 2900TR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One milliunit of lipase activity is equal to 1 nmol of fatty acids produced per min. All samples were measured at least in triplicate. Cell Culture and Treatment—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were induced for differentiation as described (35Chen B. Lam K.S. Wang Y. Wu D. Lam M.C. Shen J. Wong L. Hoo R.L. Zhang J. Xu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 341: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with different concentrations of wild type or mutant hAngptl4-CCD proteins for 4 h, and LPL activity in both secreted and surface-bound fractions was measured as above. The cell surface-bound LPL was released by incubating the sample with 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% BSA, 100 units/ml heparin for 30 min at 4 °C. Mouse Serum TG Measurement—C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Unit, and all animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the University of Hong Kong. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at 25 °C under 12-h dark/12-h light cycle and had free access to water and standard rodent chows. The mice were fasted for 4 h prior to administration of recombinant wild type or mutant hAngptl4-CCD proteins (50 μg) through tail vein injection. The same volume of PBS was injected as the control. After injection, the mice were kept fasted throughout the experiment, and blood samples were collected from mice at various time points for measurement of serum TG using a commercial TG assay kit (Leadman Bioscience, Beijing, China). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometric (MALDI-TOF MS) Analysis—MALDI-TOF MS experiments were performed using a 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF™ mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a solid state OptiBeam laser (355 nm wavelength, 200 Hz). Briefly, bovine LPL (0.3 μg, Sigma) was incubated at room temperature with 1.5 μg of BSA, hAngptl4-CCD, or its mutant protein in a total volume of 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl (TBS) (pH 7.4), for 1 h. The protein samples were mixed with the sinapinic acid matrices (10 mg/ml in a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile, 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)) and applied immediately onto the 384-well specimen holder plates (Applied Biosystems). For MS analysis, positive ion spectra were acquired in linear mode using the following parameters: laser, 4000; laser shots, 25 × 20 subspectra; delayed time, 1500 ns; m/z range, 12,000–120,000. External calibration was performed with the Calmix3 provided by the manufacturer. Surface-enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS)—A modified specimen holder plate that can hold three protein chips for analysis on 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF™ mass spectrometer was manufactured by Technology Support Centre of the University of Hong Kong with the permission from Applied Biosystems. All the protein-protein interaction experiments were performed using the SELDI protein chips with a pre-activated surface (PS20 Protein-Chip® array, Bio-Rad). Briefly, bovine LPL (5 μg) in 5 μl of PBS was immobilized onto spots of the PS20 protein chips as described before (36Wang Y. Lam K.S. Xu J.Y. Lu G. Xu L.Y. Cooper G.J. Xu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18341-18347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). After overnight coupling at 4 °C, free active sites on the spots were blocked with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature before sequential washes with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 followed by PBS alone. Subsequently, 500 ng of BSA, hAngptl4-CCD, or the mutant protein dissolved in PBS were applied onto the chip and incubated in a moist chamber at room temperature for 1 h. The unbound proteins were washed twice with PBS and rinsed with water. Saturated sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid was applied to the spot surface after air drying, and then the samples were analyzed on the 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF™ mass spectrometer using the settings described above. All of the spectra were externally calibrated using Calmix3. Biotinylation and Separation of Bovine LPL by Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—100 μg of bovine LPL was biotinylated with a Sulfo-NHS-Biotin kit (Pierce) and was then re-purified by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to separate low density lipoprotein dimers and monomers as described elsewhere (23Sukonina V. Lookene A. Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17450-17455Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 37Zhang L. Lookene A. Wu G. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42580-42591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–20% sucrose density gradient was made up in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 m NaCl, and 2 mg/ml BSA. The total gradient volume was 3.6 ml. Biotinylated LPL was loaded into each tube, followed by centrifugation using a Beckman Coulter SW60 rotor at 270,000 × g for 16 h at 10 °C. After centrifugation, fractions of 0.24 ml were collected by puncturing the bottom of each centrifugation tube with a needle that was attached with tubing to a pump. Fractions that contain LPL dimers were collected as described (23Sukonina V. Lookene A. Olivecrona T. Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17450-17455Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 37Zhang L. Lookene A. Wu G. Olivecrona G. J. Biol.

The protein samples were suspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2% BSA for further analysis. Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—Biotinylated LPL prepared as described above was subjected to heparin-Sepharose chromatography using an AKTA explorer fast protein chromatography system (GE Healthcare) as described (31Lichtenstein L. Berbee J.F. van Dijk S.J. van Dijk K.W. Bensadoun A. Kema I.P. Voshol P.J. Muller M. Rensen P.C. Kersten S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42580-42591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 5 μg of biotinylated LPL was incubated with 1 ml of heparin-Sepharose beads in a capped tube with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C to allow the binding of LPL to the beads. The samples were then subjected to a brief centrifugation, followed by washing three times with 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 2% BSA to remove unbound LPL. Afterward, the beads were incubated with 2 ml of the same buffer containing hAngptl4-CCD, Angptl3-CCD, or their mutants with shaking for another 2 h at 16 °C. The beads were collected by a brief centrifugation, washed three times as above, and placed into an empty chromatography column. LPL bound to the beads was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl (from 0.20 to 1.8 m) in the same buffer. Proteins in each fraction were precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nylon membrane, and then probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin to visualize biotinylated LPL. NH2-terminal Coiled-coil Domains of Angptl3 and Angptl4 Differentially Inhibit the LPL Activity in Vitro—Recombinant human Angptl4-CCD with an NH2-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified hAngptl4-CCD showed an apparent single band with a molecular mass of ∼21 kDa under a reduc"
https://openalex.org/W1987653094,"Recent neuroimaging studies have revealed that putatively unimodal regions of visual cortex can be activated during auditory tasks in sighted as well as in blind subjects. However, the task determinants and functional significance of auditory occipital activations (AOAs) remains unclear.We examined AOAs in an intermodal selective attention task to distinguish whether they were stimulus-bound or recruited by higher-level cognitive operations associated with auditory attention. Cortical surface mapping showed that auditory occipital activations were localized to retinotopic visual cortex subserving the far peripheral visual field. AOAs depended strictly on the sustained engagement of auditory attention and were enhanced in more difficult listening conditions. In contrast, unattended sounds produced no AOAs regardless of their intensity, spatial location, or frequency.Auditory attention, but not passive exposure to sounds, routinely activated peripheral regions of visual cortex when subjects attended to sound sources outside the visual field. Functional connections between auditory cortex and visual cortex subserving the peripheral visual field appear to underlie the generation of AOAs, which may reflect the priming of visual regions to process soon-to-appear objects associated with unseen sound sources."
https://openalex.org/W2017758309,"In the light of occurrence of bacterial strains with multiple resistances against most antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides that interact with the outer layer of Gram-negative bacteria, such as polymyxin (PMX), have recently received increased attention. Here we present a study of the interactions of PMX-B, -E, and -M with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from a deep rough mutant strain of Escherichia coli. A method for efficient purification of biosynthetically produced LPS using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography in combination with ternary solvent mixtures was developed. LPS was incorporated into a membrane model, dodecylphosphocholine micelles, and its interaction with polymyxins was studied by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Data from chemical shift mapping using isotope-labeled LPS or labeled polymyxin, as well as from isotope-filtered nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments, reveal the mode of interaction of LPS with polymyxins. Using molecular dynamics calculations the complex of LPS with PMX-B in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles was modeled using restraints derived from chemical shift mapping data and intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects. In the modeled complex the macrocycle of PMX is centered around the phosphate group at GlcN-B, and additional contacts from polar side chains are formed to GlcN-A and Kdo-C, whereas hydrophobic side chains penetrate the acyl-chain region."
https://openalex.org/W1981004520,"The interaction between epithelial cells and the extracellular matrix is crucial for tissue architecture and function and is compromised during cancer progression. Dystroglycan is a membrane receptor that mediates interactions between cells and basement membranes in various epithelia. In many epithelium-derived cancers, beta-dystroglycan is expressed, but alpha-dystroglycan is not detected. Here we report that alpha-dystroglycan is correctly expressed and trafficked to the cell membrane but lacks laminin binding as a result of the silencing of the like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) gene in a cohort of highly metastatic epithelial cell lines derived from breast, cervical, and lung cancers. Exogenous expression of LARGE in these cancer cells restores the normal glycosylation and laminin binding of alpha-dystroglycan, leading to enhanced cell adhesion and reduced cell migration in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that LARGE repression is responsible for the defects in dystroglycan-mediated cell adhesion that are observed in epithelium-derived cancer cells and point to a defect of dystroglycan glycosylation as a factor in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2105972088,"Cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that is involved in the regulation of cell surface-associated traits and the persistence of infections. Omnipresent GGDEF and EAL domains, which occur in various combinations with regulatory domains, catalyze c-di-GMP synthesis and degradation, respectively. The crystal structure of full-length YkuI from Bacillus subtilis, composed of an EAL domain and a C-terminal PAS-like domain, has been determined in its native form and in complex with c-di-GMP and Ca2+. The EAL domain exhibits a triose-phosphate isomerase-barrel fold with one antiparallel β-strand. The complex with c-di-GMP-Ca2+ defines the active site of the putative phosphodiesterase located at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel. The EAL motif is part of the active site with Glu-33 of the motif being involved in cation coordination. The structure of the complex allows the proposal of a phosphodiesterase mechanism, in which the divalent cation and the general base Glu-209 activate a catalytic water molecule for nucleophilic in-line attack on the phosphorus. The C-terminal domain closely resembles the PAS-fold. Its pocket-like structure could accommodate a yet unknown ligand. YkuI forms a tight dimer via EAL-EAL and trans EAL-PAS-like domain association.

The dinucleotide cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) was discovered about 20 years ago when it was found to regulate the activity of cellulase synthase in Acetobacter xylinum (1Ross P. Weinhouse H. Aloni Y.

However, its prominent role as a global second messenger has been realized only upon the recent recognition of the omnipresence of genes coding for domains that catalyze c-di-GMP biosynthesis and degradation in eubacteria (2Galperin M.Y.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4169-4182Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). All the domains have been named according to their sequence signature motifs. They are typically found in combinations with various other, mostly sensory or regulatory, domains. It is thought that the balance between antagonistic diguanylate cyclase and PDE-A activities determines the cellular level of c-di-GMP and, thus, affects a variety of physiological processes in bacteria. It has been shown that, in general, c-di-GMP regulates cell surface-associated traits and community behavior such as biofilm formation (for reviews see Refs. 11Jenal U. Malone J. Annu. Rev.

In particular, the dinucleotide has been proposed to orchestrate the switch between acute and persistent phase of infection. The best characterized diguanylate cyclase is PleD from Caulobacter crescentus with a Rec-Rec-GGDEF domain architecture (Rec indicates response regulator receiver domain). The structure of its GGDEF domain revealed a single GTP-binding site and suggested that dimerization is the prerequisite for enzymatic activity (4Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This has been corroborated recently by crystallography showing directly that BeF3− modification of the first Rec domain, mimicking phosphorylation by the cognate kinase, induces formation of a tightly packed dimer (15Wassmann P.

Additionally, an upper limit of c-di-GMP levels in the cell seems to be ensured by potent allosteric product inhibition of the PleD cyclase (4Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U.

Raghavan R.V. Sondermann H. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e67Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which showed a tetrameric quaternary structure and active and feedback inhibition sites that are very similar to those in PleD. For EAL domains, it has been demonstrated that genetic knock-out results in phenotypes that are in line with the paradigm that an elevated cellular c-di-GMP concentration corresponds to a sessile and a low concentration to a motile bacterial life style (13Tischler A.D.

The Bacillus subtilis YkuI protein was targeted for structure determination by the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics as a member of the large sequence family that contains EAL (Pfam number PF00563) domains. Here we report the crystal structure of YkuI showing the fold of the N-terminal EAL domain and the C-terminal PAS-like domain. Co-crystallization with c-di-GMP revealed the substrate binding mode and allows the proposal of a catalytic mechanism. The PAS-like domain most probably has regulatory function, which is discussed. Recently, another EAL structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank by the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics, the EAL domain of a GGDEF-EAL protein from Thiobacillus denitrificans (tdEAL; PDB code 2r6o). Comparison of the two structures suggests a possible regulatory mechanism. Expression and Purification of Selenomethionine and Wild-type YkuI and Its EAL Domain—For expression and purification of selenomethionine (Se-Met) YkuI protein high through-put protocols developed at the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics were used. Overexpression of full-length B. subtilis YkuI protein with N-terminal His6 tag using the pMCSG7 vector transformed into the Escherichia coli host strain BL21-DE3 was performed as described (23Korolev S. Ikeguchi Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Pegg A.E. Savchenko A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 24Stols L. Gu M. Dieckman L. Raffen R. Collart F.R. Donnelly M.I. Protein Expression Purif. 2002; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The EALYkuI construct encompassed amino acids 1-259 and the same His6 tag and tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site as the full-length construct and carried the point mutation I258T (chosen to improve solubility). The standard protocol was modified for the wild-type YkuI protein used in co-crystallization experiments and for EALYkuI. These were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Induction was performed at A600 of 0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were harvested 4 h after induction by centrifugation at 6000 × g(max) (Sorval SLA 3000) for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), and cells were then lysed by French press (Thermo Electron Corp.). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g(max) (Sorval SLA 1500) at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. The charged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow™ resin (Qiagen AG) pre-equilibrated with the lysis buffer was added to the cell lysates and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. Then beads were loaded on a poly-prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed with lysis buffer. The eluted fractions from 50 and 100 mm imidazole were pooled and concentrated to around 10 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra device with a cutoff of 30 kDa (Millipore AG). The concentrated protein was centrifuged at 16,000 × g (max) (Vaudaux-Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5804 R) at 4 °C for 10 min and loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences Europe) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 500 mm NaCl. Fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml (assuming an ϵ280 of 65,335 m-1 cm-1 Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization conditions for Se-Met YkuI were found using the Hampton Research (Riverside, CA) Crystal Screen I. A hanging drop consisting of 2 μl of a protein solution (11 mg/ml) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol mixed with 2 μl of a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000 was equilibrated with 1 ml of the reservoir. Se-Met protein crystals suitable for data collection were obtained within a week. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected at the selenium absorption peak on a single Se-Met crystal to a resolution of 2.6 Å (Table 1). Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the 5-ID-B beam line of the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL. Images were integrated and intensities scaled in the XDS suite (25Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement of Se-Met YkuI—17 positions out of 20 possible selenium sites were determined with the program SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) based on 2.6 Å resolution single wavelength anomalous data (Table 1). The asymmetric unit consists of two polypeptide chains, each containing 10 selenium atoms. The relation between the selenium sites helped to locate the noncrystallographic (NCS) 2-fold axis, which was present in the calculated self-rotation function (27Rossmann M.G. Blow D.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1962; 15: 24Crossref Google Scholar) as a strong peak. Selenium sites were refined with the program SHARP (28De La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and initial phases were modified by multidomain NCS averaging using the program DM in the CCP4 suite (29Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). An initial model was built using RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The model consisted of short 5-10-residue peptide chains, although the quality of modified map was relatively good. The main parts of polypeptide chain were built using poly(Ala) modules of α-helixes and β-strands, 15-20 residues long, fitted in the electron density maps in TURBO-FRODO (30Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Partner Directory. 1989; Google Scholar). NCS information was used during model building and averaging to improve the electron density maps. Cycles of manual rebuilding were followed by positional simulated annealing and temperature factor refinement with the program CNS (31Brunger A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), which gradually improved the model. The free R factor was monitored by setting aside 5% of the reflections as a test data set (32Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). Final steps of the model refinement were performed in REFMAC5 (29Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using bulk solvent and translation liberation spin correction (33Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The final refinement statistics is given in Table 1. Determination of the YkuI c-di-GMP Complex Structure—The YkuI c-di-GMP complex was formed by mixing 8.3 mg/ml YkuI with 2 mm chemically synthesized c-di-GMP (55Amiot N.C. Heintz K. Giese B. Synthesis. 2006; 24: 4230-4236Google Scholar) and 2 mm CaCl2 (all final concentrations) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 500 mm NaCl. Rod-like crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C under the following condition. YkuI ligand complex was mixed with reservoir solution (28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 3% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm imidazole (pH 8.0)) at a ratio of 1:1. Diffraction data were collected to 2.8 Å from a single crystal at the Swiss Light Source, Villigen, Switzerland. The images were indexed and integrated using the program MOSFLM (34Leslie A. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; Google Scholar). Because both the native and the c-di-GMP complex of YkuI crystallized in the same space group with similar unit cell dimensions, the same set of test reflections as for the native data was used for subsequent Rfree calculations. The structure was solved by rigid body refinement starting with the Se-Met structure, followed by translation liberation spin and full atom refinement with strong restraints on the B factors and NCS restraints using the program REFMAC5 (29Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The crystallographic statistic is given in Table 1. Activity Measurements—Pure samples of c-di-GMP were obtained from N. Amiot, Department Chemistry, University of Basel. C-di-GMP-specific PDE activity was assayed indirectly by monitoring the production of phosphate using an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay (35Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 5 μm YkuI in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, 100 μm c-di-GMP, and alkaline phosphatase (900 milliunits/ml). The reaction was stopped by transferring 100 μl of reaction mixture into the phosphate assay reagent (pH ≈0; 1 ml final volume) containing molybdate and malachite green. As positive control, the activity of YahA from E. coli was verified. EALYkuI was assayed as described above. The measurements were performed at different protein concentrations (1, 10, 20, and 50 μm) using concentrations of c-di-GMP ranging from 100 μm to 1 mm. The reactions were kept at room temperature for different incubation times (10, 30, and 60 min and overnight) and then stopped as reported above. Bioinformatics—Molecular interface areas were calculated with the PISA server (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies service (PISA) at EBI (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar)). For domain and fold classifications, the CATH (version 3.2.0) and Pfam (version 23.0) data bases were interrogated (37Greene L.H. Lewis T.E. Addou S. Cuff A. Dallman T. Dibley M. Redfern O. Pearl F.

Structural homologs to the YkuI_C domain were identified by the NCBI VAST server. Structure comparisons were performed with the SSM server (Protein Structure Comparison service SSM at EBI (39Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar)) and topp (29Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Overall Structure and Topology—The crystal structure of full-length YkuI from B. subtilis has been determined by single wavelength-anomalous-diffraction phasing using Se-Met substituted protein. Crystallographic data are given in Table 1. The entire main chain is defined by electron density with the exception of the purification tag and loop region 181-184 in both chains, as well as the N-terminal Met-1 of chain A and the C-terminal residues 401-407 of chain B. Additionally, there are one β-mercaptoethanol and 255 water molecules. Both chain structures are similar, but deviations are found for some loops (r.m.s.d. = 0.83 Å for all C-α positions after superpositions). In the following, the structure description refers to chain A. Fig. 1 shows the fold of YkuI. The 407-residue polypeptide is composed of an N-terminal EAL domain and a PAS-like C-terminal domain connected by a long α-helix (αlink). Secondary structure assignments are given in Fig. 2. The asymmetric unit contains a tight homodimer, which is formed by 2-fold association of the EAL domains and trans association of the PAS and EAL* domains (the asterisk indicates an element of the adjacent subunit in the YkuI dimer). The two EAL domains in the asymmetric unit of the tdEAL structure (PDB code 2r6o) 5C. Chang, X. Xu, H. Zheng, A. Savchenko, A. M. Edwards, and A. Joachimiak, unpublished data. show the same dimeric arrangement with an r.m.s.d. of 2.3 Å for 344 of the 470 C-α positions after superposition (the A-chains super-impose with 1.7 Å/162). This is surprising because the sequence similarity is modest, 21% identity, and the fragment of tdEAL protein that was crystallized was an isolated EAL domain.FIGURE 2Sequence alignments of YkuI with structural homologs. Residue numbers correspond to the YkuI sequence (Swiss-Prot accession code O35014). The secondary structure elements of YkuI are displayed at the top. A, alignment with the EAL domains of an EAL-GGDEF protein from T. denitrificans (Q3SJE6), the GerE-EAL protein YahA from E. coli (P21514), the Rec-EAL protein RocR from P. aeruginosa (Q9HX69), and the EAL-GGDEF protein PdeA from C. crescentus (Q9A310). The alignment taken is that of EAL Pfam family (PF00563), with the exception of tdEAL (PDB code 2r6o) for which a structure-based alignment has been carried out. Partly and strictly conserved residues are highlighted by gray and black background, respectively. Residues that coordinate the divalent cation in YkuI and tdEAL have a magenta background; the putative general base Glu-209 is shown in red; the active site Lys-173 is in blue; the substrate-binding residues Gln-19 and Arg-37 are in green. B, structure-based alignment with PYP (PDB code 1otd) from Halorhodospira halophila (P16113) and the GAF B domain of phosphodiesterase 2a (1mc0 (49Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar)) from Mus musculus (Q922S4). The secondary structure elements of PYP and GAF B are given below the alignment. The figure was produced with ESPRIPT (54Gouet P. Courcelle E. Stuart D.I. Métoz F. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1999; 15: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (2540) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In both proteins, the interface is mainly formed by the following: (a) an antiparallel β-strand arrangement of the β5-α5 loop with its symmetry mate, and (b) antiparallel packing of helix α6 with its symmetry mate (Fig. 1B). Between the two domains of the same subunit and between the two PAS-like domains, there is no significant contact. Intriguingly, the β5-α5 contact is not symmetric. Some inter-subunit H-bonds are not formed, and the rotation angle for superposition of the EAL subunits is 175°. The break-in symmetry probably reflects asymmetry in the crystal contacts, which are, however, remote from the EAL-EAL interface. This demonstrates that the β5-α5 interface is sensitive to large distance perturbations. The repercussions this may have for regulation is shown further below (see under “Regulation of PDE Activity”). The crystal dimer exhibits an extensive interface area of about 3000 Å2 with a low ΔG of -30 kcal/mol and a good complementary surface score of 0.919 as measured by PISA (36Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). Other interfaces in the crystal lattice (not shown) are at least seven times smaller and show no significant complementary surface score. This suggests that the crystal dimer also represents the quaternary structure of YkuI in solution consistent with light scattering experiments (data not shown). Another indication that the crystal dimer likely represents a functional dimer is that conserved surface-exposed amino acids occur in patches at the points of contact (Fig. 3). EAL Domain Structure—The crystal structure of YkuI provides the first view of an EAL domain. This domain, also known as DUF2 (Domain of Unknown Function 2) was originally detected through amino acid sequence comparisons (2Galperin M.Y. Nikolskaya A.N. Koonin E.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 11-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it was found to be very common in bacterial species, often occurring in multiple genes and in the context of a variety of other domains. The EAL domain exhibits the TIM-barrel fold (Fig. 1A) with, however, the first helix after strand β1 missing and β1 running antiparallel to the remaining strands. Thus, the succession of the major secondary structure elements is αβ(βα)6β with an N-terminal extra helix α1 and an extended loop instead of the canonical C-terminal helix. There is a small bifurcation of the central β-sheet formed by strands β1, β2, and β2′ (Fig. 1A). The β-barrel of canonical TIM-barrels, one of the most common protein superfamilies (40Nagano N. Orengo C.A. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 741-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), is composed of entirely parallel β-strands. Among the exceptions, in the enol"

PYK2 and FAK are large multidomain proteins containing an N-terminal FERM domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal segment containing dual proline rich (PR) subdomains and a focal adhesion targeting (FAT) region (1Avraham A. Park S.Y. Shinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell. Sig. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 2Hanks S.K. Encyclopedia of Biol. Chem. 2004; 2: 80-84Crossref Google Scholar). While FAK is widely expressed, PYK2 expression is relatively restricted with highest levels in brain and the hematopoeitic system. Unlike FAK, optimal PYK2 activation is dependent on Ca2+ mobilization. PYK2 (-/-) animals have been described previously, and develop normally (3Okigaki M. Davis C. Falasca M. Harroch S.

Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Characterization of the immune system of PYK2(-/-) animals revealed the absence of marginal zone B-cells along with abnormal T-cell independent type II responses (4Guinamard R. Okigaki M. Schlessinger J. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Immun. 2000; 1: 31-36Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and altered macrophage morphology, migration and signaling in response to cell attachment or chemokine treatment (3Okigaki M. Davis C.

These studies strengthen the link between PYK2 and signaling through chemokine and integrin receptors. In addition, PYK2(-/-) mice were shown to have increased susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and diabetes (5Yu Y. Ross S.A. Halseth A.E. Hollenbach P.W. Hill R.J. Gulve E.A. Bond B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 334: 1085-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Recently, the characterization of PYK2(-/-) mice showed a high bone mass phenotype resulting from increased osteogenesis and osteoblast activity. Using PYK2(-/-) mouse bone marrow cultures and hMSCs expressing a PYK2 shRNA, elimination or reduction of PYK2 protein levels resulted in significantly enhanced osteogeogenesis. Importantly, the daily administration of a pyrimidine-based PYK2 inhibitor, PF-431396, increased bone formation, and protected against bone loss in ovariectomized rats (6Buckbinder L. Crawford D.T. Qi H. Ke H.Z. Olson L.M. Long K.R. Bonnette P.C. Baumann A.P. Hambor J.E. Grasser III, W.A. Pan L.C. Owen T.A. Luzzio M.J. Hulford C.A. Gebhard D.F. Paralkar V.M. Simmons H.A. Kath J.C. Roberts W.G.

PYK2(-/-) mice showed mild osteopetrosis which was attributed to the impairment in osteoclast function (7Gil-Henn H. Destaing O. Sims N.A. Aoki K. Alles N. Neff L. Sanjay A. Bruzzaniti A. De Camilli P. Baron R. Schlessinger J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, the high bone mass phenotype may result from both enhanced osteoblast and impaired osteoclast elements.PYK2 is one member of a family of over 500 evolutionarily conserved enzymes with high amino acid and structural conservation within the catalytic ATP binding pocket. Classical kinase inhibitors bind to the ATP site and compete for substrate binding. Thus, while classical inhibitors based on ATP binding analogs have been readily identified, the inherent promiscuity of action for this class has presented significant challenges to drug design (8Traxler P. Furet P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). With the exception of cancer therapeutics, where additional therapeutic benefits may be gained by the inhibition of multiple kinase targets (e.g. Sutent, Sorafenib), minimizing off-target activity is most often desired. Therefore, there is great interest in identifying unique allosteric regulatory domains for specific kinase targets. Despite intense effort, small molecule inhibitors exploiting extra-catalytic allosteric sites have been limited to a few examples including IKK (9Burke J.R. Pattoli M.A. Gregor K.R. Brassil P.J. MacMaster J.F. McIntyre K.W. Yang X. Iotzova V.S. Clarke W. Strnad J. Qiu Y. Zusi F.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2004; 11: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Alternatively, bipartite inhibitors have been developed that stabilize an inactive conformation of the protein kinase, the prototypical example being BIRB796 binding to p38 and Gleevec binding to Abl. Such compounds make contact with both the conserved ATP site and less conserved regions of the activation loop, thus offering the potential for improved selectivity (11Liu Y. Gray N.S. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The N terminus of the activation loop contains an invariant Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif, and is an important determinant of enzyme activity. In the active or “DFG-in” conformation, these amino acids are involved in the coordination of ATP. Conversely, the “DFG-out” state does not bind ATP and the kinase is inactive. While a handful of kinases are known to adopt a DFG-out conformation (e.g. p38, Abl, etc), it remains to be determined how general this strategy might be in the design of selective kinase inhibitors.To help elucidate the molecular mechanism of PYK2 and its substrate specificity, we used biophysical methods and determined multiple x-ray structures of the PYK2 kinase domain. High-resolution structures of apo and ATPγS-bound forms were obtained as well as a complex with PF-431396, a “classical” kinase inhibitor. Empirical screening identified BIRB796 as a weak PYK2 kinase inhibitor. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and NMR studies indicated that PYK2 could adopt a “DFG-out” conformation. Despite the low affinity, a 1.75-Å co-crystal structure was obtained with BIRB796 revealing a novel binding mode. Our biophysical and structural results provide insight into the enzyme-substrate complex and allowed us to advance the rational design of a selective DFG-out inhibitor with improved PYK2 selectivity and potency. The compound, PF-4618433, showed robust osteogenic activity in hMSC cultures.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Cloning, Expression, and Purification—A modified pFastBac vector was constructed to have an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. PfuTurbo (from Stratagene) was used to amplify the catalytic domain of PYK2 from a full-length clone. The 854-bp DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into the modified pFastBac vector at these sites to yield an N-terminal His6-tagged thrombin cleavable fusion with PYK2 catalytic domain residues Pro-416 to Glu-692 based on accession U33284. Standard expression conditions using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System from Invitrogen and Sf9 cells were employed for large-scale expression in shake flask and WAVE BioReactors.Baculovirus cell paste containing the overexpressed His-PYK2 catalytic domain (416-692) recombinant protein was resuspended in 3 volumes of buffer A (100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4; pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, Complete™ protease inhibitor (1 tablet/50 ml), Roche, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μl of Benzonase (Sigma) per 50 ml volume). All reagents and cells were kept on ice. Cells were lysed with 2 passes on a microfluidizer (pressure at 18 K). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 35 min at 30,000 × g (16,000 rpm) in a Sorval SL-50T (or appropriate) rotor. The supernatant was extracted and dispensed into a tube containing 20 ml of TALON Superflow Metal Affinity Resin (BD-Clonetech), pre-equilibrated with buffer B (100 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4; pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm imidazole; pH 7.5). The suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h, with gentle rocking, then centrifuged at 700 × g in a swinging bucket rotor for 2-4 min, and the supernatant was extracted. The supernatant was kept, and the resin resuspended in 20.0 ml of buffer B (this wash step was repeated four more times). The resin was then transferred to an XK-26 column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a FPLC™ and washed with buffer B until the OD reached 0.05 units. Peak elution was achieved with a gradient using buffer C (buffer B with 250 mm imidazole). Eluted fractions were pooled and buffer exchanged into buffer D (20 mm Tris; pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP) using multiple runs on a HiPrep 26/10 desalt column. Pooled fractions from the desalt step were concentrated to no more than 10 mg/ml and 1-ml aliquots loaded onto a Superdex 200 16/30 column, equilibrated with buffer E (25 ml HEPES; pH7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP). Peak fractions were pooled from multiple runs and concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 6 ml concentrator (10 K cutoff), aliquoted into 110-μl volumes and flash-frozen at -80 °C for use in crystallization trials.NMR and SPR Studies—The NMR spectra of 15N-PHE-labeled PYK2 were collected at 600 MHz on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with cryoprobe. The concentration of the PYK2 protein was 100 μm in 50 mm deuterated Tris buffer, 100 mm NaCl, and pH 7.5. Ligands were added from deuterated DMSO stock solution to yield final ligand concentration of 150 μm. To assign the Phe of the DFG loop, a mutated sample of [15N]Phe-labeled PYK2 with the Phe of the DFG loop mutated to Trp was made, and TROSY spectrum collected. To confirm the assignment, a sample of 13C-Asp-15N-Phe labeled PYK2 was also made, and high resolution TROSY spectra of the protein with and without 13C decoupling were collected (data not shown). Because the DFG loop contains the only Asp-Phe pattern in the PYK2 kinase sequence, the Phe of the DFG loop was identified by the change of 13C-coupling pattern in the TROSY spectra.SPR kinetic measurements were performed on a Biacore 3000 biosensor (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). PYK2 catalytic domain was biotinylated with maleimide PEO biotin (Pierce Chemical) and immobilized on a neutravidin surface prepared on a CM4 chip by standard direct amine coupling procedures. Kinetic analyses were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 3% DMSO. Compounds were injected over sample and reference flow cells at 50 or 100 μl/min. Surfaces were regenerated by prolonged buffer flow. Data were processed using Scrubber 2 software (BioLogic Software) to y-zero, x-align, and double reference against buffer injections and a neutravidin surface lacking any immobilized ligand. Kinetic analyses were performed using BiaEval software (GE Healthcare).Crystallization—Crystallization of apo-PYK2, with the BIRB796, with PF-431396, and with the PF-4618433 inhibitor was achieved using a 5 mg/ml protein stock. For co-crystallization experiments, inhibitor (from a DMSO stock of 30 mm) was used to give a final concentration of between 0.5-1 mm. Hanging drops of 2 μl + 2 μl were setup over 750 μl of well solution in standard Linbro plates and incubated at 22 °C. Initial screening using Hampton screens produced a condition, 0.1 m bis-Tris: pH 6.0-7.0, 0.2 m MgCl2, 20-27% PEG 3350, 1 mm TCEP, which gave needle crystals that were optimized by refinement of the conditions as well as multiple rounds of streak and micro-seeding. For the inhibitor co-complex crystallization, the optimized crystals were further soaked overnight in 3 mm inhibitor to increase the occupancy of the inhibitor.Crystallization of PYK2 with ATPγS was achieved using a protein solution at 15 mg/ml with 1-2 mm ATPγS added, 2 + 2 μl hanging drops were setup over 750 μl of well solutions containing 0.1 m citrate; pH 5.0-6.0, 0.5-1.5 m lithium sulfate, and 0.2-0.4 m ammonium sulfate. Plates were incubated at 22 °C, and crystals resembling plate clusters were obtained after 3-5 days.Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected from flash-frozen crystals at 100 K at beamline 17-ID at Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory. Data were processed using the HKL2000 suite of software (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of PYK2-apo was solved by molecular replacement methods with the CCP4 version of PHASER (13McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14133) Google Scholar), using the FAK structure (PDB code 1MP8) as a search model. (During the manuscript preparation, a PYK2-apo structure was deposited with PDB code of 3CC6). After molecular replacement, maximum likelihood-based refinement of the atomic position and temperature factors were performed with REFMAC (14Murshudov G.N. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar), and the atomic model was built with the program O (15Jones T.A. Zou S.W. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The refined PYK2-apo was then used as a starting model for all other complexes. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed by PROCHECK (16Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 24: 946-950Google Scholar). Crystallographic statistics for the final models are shown in Table 1. Structural alignments with PYK2-apo and other complexes were performed using the lsq options in O (15Jones T.A. Zou S.W. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Figures were prepared with PYMOL (Delano Scientific).Osteogenesis Assays—hMSC cultures, alkaline phosphatase assays, and mineralization analysis were performed as described previously (6Buckbinder L. Crawford D.T. Qi H. Ke H.Z. Olson L.M. Long K.R. Bonnette P.C. Baumann A.P. Hambor J.E. Grasser III, W.A. Pan L.C. Owen T.A. Luzzio M.J. Hulford C.A. Gebhard D.F. Paralkar V.M. Simmons H.A. Kath J.C.

Images were taken at a fixed exposure and the blue fluorescence of calcein-labeled nodules was captured with a 12-bit camera and a10× objective. One hundred fields were collected per well. If more than 10 fields were assayed with 5 or less objects per field, the scan for that well was aborted. This criterion was set so as not to completely scan wells devoid of nodules. Objects with fluorescence above a minimum threshold were evaluated for size, shape, and average/total intensity. The object selection criteria were applied uniformly to all wells, and designed to eliminate fluorescent objects that did not resemble osteoblast nodules. All analyzed fields were also manually examined for image processing artifacts (bubble, flare, or dust), and all fields containing artifacts were excluded from the analysis.Kinase Assays and Selectivity Profiling—Kinase assays for PYK2 and FAK were as described (6Buckbinder L. Crawford D.T. Qi H. Ke H.Z. Olson L.M. Long K.R. Bonnette P.C. Baumann A.P. Hambor J.E. Grasser III, W.A. Pan L.C. Owen T.A. Luzzio M.J. Hulford C.A. Gebhard D.F. Paralkar V.M. Simmons H.A. Kath J.C.

IC50 determinations were generated from 8 point dose response curves. Selectivity profiling against a diverse panel of kinases was performed by a commercial vendor (Invitrogen) and reported as average percent inhibition of duplicate tests.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structures of PYK2—Five crystal structures were determined for unphosphorylated human PYK2 kinase domain, all of which were refined to acceptable R-values and geometry (Table 1). The overall structure is very similar to other kinase catalytic domains, displaying a bilobal architecture. The smaller N-terminal lobe contains a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and a single α-helix (αC). The larger C-terminal lobe is mostly α helical and contains the activation loop involved in polypeptide substrate binding. N- and C-terminal lobes are connected by the so-called hinge sequence, which partially defines the binding site for ATP and ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors (Fig. 1). Two structures contain ATP-mimetic inhibitors (ATPγS and PF-431396) and adopt an active, closed conformation in the DFG motif. In contrast, the structures in the presence of diaryl urea inhibitors (BIRB796 and PF-4618433) reveal an allosteric binding pocket distinct from the ATP pocket. The activation loop residues beyond DFG motif are partially disordered in all five structures and are not visible in the electron density maps; residues 577-586 (Apo), residues 570-584 (ATPγs-bound form), residues 573-584 (PF-431396 complex), residues 570-586 (BIRB796 complex), and residues 573-586 (PF-4618433 complex).The catalytic domains of PYK2 and FAK share about 60% sequence identity. Least-squares Cα superposition of the PYK2 (ATPγs-bound form) and FAK (ADP-bound form, PDB:1MP8) kinase domain reveals this similarity and yields an overall R.M.S.D. value of 1.2 Å for 244 Cα atom pairs. Differences in the Cα backbones are more pronounced in the N-terminal lobe: residues 425-433 (β4; R.M.S.D. = 1.9 Å), residues 459-464 (loop connecting β2 to αC; R.M.S.D. = 4.9 Å), residues 465-481 (αC; R.M.S.D. = 2.4 Å), and residues 494-498 (loop connecting β4 to β5; R.M.S.D. = 2.3 Å). These substantial structural differences are in part due to the unusual feature of an intramolecular disulfide bond observed in the FAK crystal structure. In the FAK-ADP complex, Cys-456 and Cys-459, which are widely conserved in vertebrate FAK sequences, form a disulfide bond on the surface of the N-terminal lobe adjacent to the αC helix (17Nowakowski J. Cronin C.N. McRee D.E. Knuth M.W. Nelson C.G. Sang B.-C. Scheibe D.N. Swanson R.V. Thompson D.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 1659-1667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In all five PYK2 structures, however, this disulfide bond is absent and the corresponding structural region is directly connected to an αC helix (Fig. 1).Structures of ATP-γS and PF-431396 Complexes—The ATP binding sites of protein kinases are the most common targets for the design of small molecule inhibitors. Discovery and optimization of ATP-competitive inhibitors had been perceived as a difficult obstacle to overcome due to the highly conserved nature of the ATP binding site among kinase domains. However, small structural differences and plasticity between the ATP binding sites of even closely homologous kinases has been successfully exploited to achieve selectivity and potency (18Wang Z. Canagarajah B.J. Boehm J.C. Kassisa S. Cobb M.H. Young P.R. Abdel-Meguid S. Adams J.L. Goldsmith E.J.

Ther. 1999; 82: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the PYK2-ATPγs complex, the adenine base inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of Leu-431, Ala-455, Val-487, Leu-504, and Leu-556. The N1 nitrogen and the amino group of the adenine ring hydrogen bond to the main chain of Tyr-505 and Glu-503, respectively. This H-bond pattern is at the heart of the interaction of ATP with kinases, and has been used extensively to design and optimize ATP competitive inhibitors (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2A, molecular surface of the PYK2 in the active site region in complex with ATPγS (magenta). Critical side chains are labeled (ball and stick representation) with hydrogen bonds (dashed lines). B, active site of PYK2 bound to PF-431396 (magenta). Hydrophobic residues interacting with the sulfonamide group are shown in yellow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibitors of the trifluoromethyl pyrimidine series (PF-431396) occupy the nucleotide binding pocket, with the pyrimidine ring located in the adenine pocket (Fig. 2B). Both the N1 nitrogen of pyrimidine ring and amide nitrogen of the 5-amino oxindole form hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carbonyl and amide backbone of Tyr-505. The oxindole ring is further stabilized by water-mediated hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain of Glu-509. The trifluoromethyl group is involved in hydrophobic interactions with Val-487, Met-502, and Ala-455. The hydrophobic phenyl ring occupies the ribose binding pocket and is perpendicular to the pyrimidine ring. The amine group connecting pyrimidine and phenyl ring forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond interaction with Asp-567 of the DFG motif. The methyl group attached to the sulfonamide is wedged into the glycine-rich loop by hydrophobic interactions with Leu-431, Gly-432, and Val-439. PF-431396 exhibits strong dual inhibitory activity for both PYK2 and FAK with an IC50 of 11 and 2 nm, respectively. Molecular modeling of PF-431396 predicts the same binding mode in FAK with small conformational changes in the glycinerich loop.The structural analysis of PF-431396 offered an explanation for the lack of compound selectivity between these two FAK family enzymes. In fact, more than half of the kinases tested with PF-431396 in a diverse subset panel at 10 μm showed >50% inhibition (Fig. 3), and greater than 90% inhibition was observed with this compound for JAK3, TrkA, and Aur2 even at 1 μm (data not shown). Thus, while PF-431396 shows an overall preference for the FAK family, it is not absolutely selective. Off-target cross activity may be related to the modest activity of bone efficacy in a cell culture model (see Fig. 7, below). Therefore, we sought to determine whether the PYK2 kinase might be a candidate for a DFG-out inhibitor approach, a strategy that has led to compounds with improved selectivity against other kinases. The prototype DFG-out p38 kinase inhibitor, BIRB796, was profiled in a PYK2 enzyme assay and was active with an IC50 of 1.5 μm (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3A heat map depicting the percent inhibition activity for the indicated compounds against the reference kinases (FAK and PYK2, tested at 3 μm), as well as for a diverse panel of kinases (tested at 10 μm), as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7PF-4618433 promotes osteogenesis of hMSC cultures. hMSC cultures were treated with PF-431396 (days 4-7) or with PF-4618433 (days 1-7), and alkaline phosphatase activity determined on day 7 (A and B, respectively). hMSC cultures treated with PF-4618433 were analyzed for mineral by incorporation of blue calcein and the well imaged by fluorescent micrograph (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).

https://openalex.org/W2023461806,"Lens epithelium-derived growth factor/p75 (LEDGF/p75) is a prominent cellular interaction partner of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) integrase, tethering the preintegration complex to the host chromosome. In light of the development of LEDGF/p75-integrase interaction inhibitors, it is essential to understand the cell biology of LEDGF/p75. We identified pogZ as new cellular interaction partner of LEDGF/p75. Analogous to lentiviral integrase, pogZ, a domesticated transposase, carries a DDE domain, the major determinant for LEDGF/p75 interaction. Using different in vitro and in vivo approaches, we corroborated the interaction between the C terminus of LEDGF/p75 and the DDE domain of pogZ, revealing an overlap in the binding of pogZ and HIV-1 integrase. Competition experiments showed that integrase is efficient in displacing pogZ from LEDGF/p75. Moreover, pogZ does not seem to play a role as a restriction factor of HIV. The finding that LEDGF/p75 is capable of interacting with a DDE domain protein that is not a lentiviral integrase points to a profound role of LEDGF/p75 in DDE domain protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2049641981,"The effects of shear stress on the keratin intermediate filament (KIF) cytoskeleton of cultured human alveolar epithelial (A549) cells have been investigated. Under normal culture conditions, immunofluorescence revealed a delicate network of fine tonofibrils containing KIFs, together with many nonfilamentous, keratin-containing ""particles,"" mostly containing either keratin 8 (K8) or 18 (K18), but not both. Triton X-100 extracted approximately 10% of the cellular keratin, and this was accompanied by a loss of the particles but not the KIFs. Shear stress dramatically reduced the soluble keratin component and transformed the fine bundles of KIFs into thicker, ""wavy"" tonofibrils. Both effects were accompanied by the disappearance of most keratin particles and by increased phosphorylation of K8 and K18 on serine residues 73 and 33, respectively. The particles that remained after shearing were phosphorylated and were closely associated with KIFs. We suggest that keratin particles constitute a reservoir of protein that can be recruited into KIFs under flow, creating a more robust cytoskeleton able to withstand shear forces more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2074206014,"Our studies have shown that constitutive interactions between hyaluronan and CD44 on tumor cells induces various anti-apoptotic cell survival pathways through the formation of a multimeric signaling complex that contains activated receptor tyrosine kinases.

Although the anti-tumor activity of hyaluronan-oligosaccharides, a hyaluronan-CD44 interaction antagonist, is effective in sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents and reducing tumor growth in xenografts, hyaluronan-oligosaccharide alone was not effective in reducing tumor progression in Apc Min/+ mice. We now show in vitro and in vivo that targeted inhibition of the expression of CD44v6 depletes the ability of the colon tumor cells to signal through hyaluronan-CD44v6 interactions.

Second, using pSico-CD44v6 shRNA and a colon-specific Fabpl promoter-driven Cre recombinase expression vector packaged into transferrin-coated nanoparticles, we successfully delivered the CD44v6 shRNA within pre-neoplastic and neoplastic colon malignant cells. Third, using the Apc Min/+ mice model, we demonstrated that inhibition of the CD44v6 expression reduces the signaling through a hyaluronan/CD44v6-pErbB2-Cox-2 interaction pathway and reduced adenoma number and growth.

Hyaluronan (HA) 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; Cox-2, cyclooxygenase-2; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; siRNA, silencing RNA; Tf, transferring; Tf-R, Tf receptor; PEG, polyethylene glycol; PEI, polyethyleneimine; Min, multiple intestinal neoplasia; CD44v, CD44 variant isoforms; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; FAP, familial adenomatous polyposis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Apc, adenomatous polyposis coli. is one of the constituents of extracellular matrix. HA is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan present in almost every tissue of vertebrates. It is concentrated in regions of high cell division and invasion. Like numerous extracellular matrix constituents, HA serves both structural and instructive roles in terms of cell signaling via HA receptors, mainly CD44, on the surface of most cells (2Markwald R.R. Fitzharris T.P. Bank H. Bernanke D.H. Dev. Biol. 1978; 62: 292-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.Y. Spicer A.P. Curr. Opin.

However, when cells proliferate or migrate, e.g. in embryonic processes, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and diseases such as cancer and atherosclerosis, HA-induced signaling is activated (4Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 5Hascall V.C. Majors A.K. De La Motte C.A. Evanko S.P. Wang A. Drazba J.A. Strong S.A. Wight T.N. Biochim. Biophys.

Disord. 2005; 5: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). High levels of HA in tumors are a prognostic factor in several malignancies (7Tammi R.H. Kultti A. Kosma V.M. Pirinen R. Auvinen P. Tammi M.I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2008; 18: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and manipulations of HA production or interaction with cell surface receptors strongly influence tumor growth and metastasis (4Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 6Adamia S. Maxwell C.A. Pilarski L.M. Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Haematol. Disord. 2005; 5: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). CD44 also has an important role in tumor progression (8Naor D. Nedvetzki S. Golan I. Melnik L. Faitelson Y. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 527-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). CD44 proteins exist in three states with respect to HA binding as follows: non-HA binding; nonbinding unless activated by physiological stimuli; or constitutively activated (9Lesley J. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2719-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus HA induces intracellular signaling when it binds to “constitutively activated” CD44 variants during cell dynamic processes, but it does not do so under conditions of adult tissue homeostasis (10Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 11Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The CD44 structure of normal cells is distinct from that of cancer cells, because under various physiological and pathological conditions, the local environmental pressure influences alternate splicing and post-translational modification to produce diversified CD44 molecules (8Naor D. Nedvetzki S. Golan I. Melnik L. Faitelson Y. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2002; 39: 527-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 12van Weering D.H. Baas P.D. Bos J.L. PCR Methods Appl. 1993; 3: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This diversification allows the production of specific targeting agents that will be useful for both diagnosis and therapy. Overexpression of the variant high molecular weight isoforms CD44v4-v7 and CD44v6-v9 in human lymphomas, colorectal adenocarcinomas, endometrial cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, lung and breast cancer, and metastasizing rat adenocarcinomas (13Ponta H.

Okamoto I. Gohji K. Yamanaka K. Arakawa S. Saya H. Kamidono S. J. Urol. 1998; 160: 1562-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, the systemic application of antibodies directed against the v6 epitope and the expression of antisense CD44v6 can retard tumor growth and block metastasis in vivo (13Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar, 14Naor D. Sionov R.V. Zahalka M. Rochman M. Holzmann B. Ish-Shalom D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 231: 143-166PubMed Google Scholar), emphasizing the potential importance of CD44 variants as therapeutic targets in cancer, particularly colon cancer. Indeed overexpression of CD44 is an early event in the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence (22Kim H. Yang X.L. Rosada C. Hamilton S.R. August J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Takahashi K. Stamenkovic I. Cutler M. Saya H. Tanabe K.K. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2223-2232PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ropponen K.M. Eskelinen M.J. Lipponen P.K. Alhava E. Kosma V.M. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 33: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike the targeting of various cancer-promoting molecules, CD44 targeting provides a strong opportunity for discerning therapy in colon cancer cells. Altered COX-2 gene expression occurs in human colon carcinomas, and Cox-2 antagonists inhibit colon cancer progression in animal models (25Gupta R.A. Dubois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 26Simmons D.L. Botting R.M. Hla T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 387-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). A recent study implicates COX-2 overexpression as a proximal mediator of CD44-dependent invasion in human non-small cell lung cancer and in human renal carcinoma cells (27Chen Q. Shinohara N. Abe T.

Our previous studies demonstrated that antagonists of HA-CD44 interactions, i.e. HA oligomers and overexpression of the ectodomain of CD44 (soluble CD44) (32Yu Q. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20603-20607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that acts as a competitive decoy by binding to endogenous HA, inhibit cell survival pathway activities, including activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases, namely ERBB2, EGFR, IGF1Rβ, c-MET, and PDGFRβ, in several types of malignant colon, breast, and prostate carcinoma cells (33Ghatak S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 34936-34941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In our recent study we demonstrated that elevated HA in normal intestinal epithelial cells (HIEC6-HAS2) regulates several properties required for the transformed phenotype. Increased HA in these cells regulates expression and enzymatic activity of COX-2, activation of ErbB2 and AKT, and translocates β-catenin to the nucleus (30Misra S. Hascall V.C. Berger F.G. Markwald R.R. Ghatak S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Misra S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Minamisawa S. Berger F.G. Markwald R.R. Toole B.P.

To explore the mechanism of constitutive HA-CD44 interaction and the consequent outcomes in cancer cells, we have shown that all four types of reagents, namely HA-oligosaccharides, anti-CD44 antibody, soluble CD44, or CD44 siRNA, block signaling responses in a variety of tumor cell types and also block activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (30Misra S. Hascall V.C. Berger F.G. Markwald R.R. Ghatak S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Misra S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Minamisawa S. Berger F.G.

Although the anti-tumor activity of HA-oligosaccharides is effective in sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents in cell culture models (34Misra S. Toole B.P. Ghatak S. J. Biol.

Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38013-38020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), HA-oligosaccharides alone are not effective in reducing tumor progression in an Apc Min/+ mice in vivo model. 4S. Misra, unpublished data. Thus, an alternative HA/CD44 antagonist is required to treat distant tumors. Because CD44 is present in the HA-induced signaling complex, we also used RNA interference to test the role of CD44 in these cancer cells (33Ghatak S. Misra S. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8875-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 34Misra S. Toole B.P. Ghatak S. J. Biol.

All cancer cell lines (HCT 116 and HCA7 colon cancer cells, C4-2 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and MCF7/Adr breast cancer cells and TA3St mouse mammary carcinoma cells) transfected with a 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to CD44 greatly decreased activation of cell survival proteins and multiple receptor tyrosine kinases as well as CD44 and COX-2 expression when compared with the above cells transfected with scrambled control siRNA (30Misra S. Hascall V.C. Berger F.G. Markwald R.R. Ghatak S. Connect. Tissue Res. 2008; 49: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Misra S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Minamisawa S. Berger F.G.

Chem. 2006; 281: 34936-34941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In mammalian cell culture, the transfection of 21-nucleotide double-stranded siRNA efficiently inhibits endogenous gene expression in a sequence-specific manner without induction of the interferon response (38Heidel J.D. Hu S. Liu X.F. Triche T.J. Davis M.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1579-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the phenotypic changes induced by siRNAs only persist 1 week because of lack of transfer of siRNA or dilution of siRNA concentration after each cell division, which limits their utility for use in inhibiting tumor progression. The technique of using shRNA in an expression vector is an alternative strategy to stably suppress gene expression, and such constructs with well defined initiation and termination sites have been used to produce various small RNA species that inhibit the expression of genes with diverse functions in mammalian cell lines (39Paul C.P. Good P.D. Winer I. Engelke D.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The conditional alteration of gene expression by the use of an shRNA expression vector holds potential promise for therapeutic approaches for silencing disease-causing genes provided that appropriate extracellular and intracellular nucleic acid delivery systems (vector systems) are available that offer efficient vehicles for stable complexation and protection of the nucleic acid. To reach the targeted tissue, vectors need to overcome a number of extracellular and intracellular barriers. Systemic targeting by viral vectors toward the desired tissue is difficult because the host immune responses activate viral clearance. Systemic administration of a large amount of adenovirus (e.g. into the liver) can be a serious health hazard that even caused the death of one patient (40Raper S.E. Chirmule N. Lee F.S. Wivel N.A. Bagg A. Gao G.P. Wilson J.M. Batshaw M.L. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 80: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Nonviral vectors, such as positively charged PEI complexes, mediate unspecific interactions with non-target cells and blood components, which results in the rapid clearance from the circulation. These unfavorable effects can be minimized by “shielding” of the positive surface charge of the vectors with polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGylation of PEI polyplexes can prevent the systemic degradation of the plasmid DNA and reduce the toxicity of polyplexes (41Kursa M. Walker G.F. Roessler V. Ogris M. Roedl W. Kircheis R. Wagner E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2003; 14: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). To increase the transfection efficiency of the shielded particles (plasmid DNA/PEG-PEI), different targeting ligands, such as peptide, growth factors and proteins, or antibodies, have been incorporated into the vectors (42Bellocq N.C. Pun S.H. Jensen G.S. Davis M.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2003; 14: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). One such targeting ligands is transferrin (Tf), an iron-transporting protein that is recognized by Tf receptors (Tf-R) present at high levels in the tumor cells (42Bellocq N.C. Pun S.H. Jensen G.S. Davis M.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2003; 14: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 43Qian Z.M. Li H. Sun H. Ho K. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 561-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In contrast, in nonproliferating cells, expression of Tf-R is low or undetectable. Association of Tf to polyplexes significantly enhances transfection efficiency by promoting the internalization of polyplexes (plasmid DNA/Tf-PEG-PEI (designated as nanoparticles throughout this study)) in dividing and nondividing cells (42Bellocq N.C. Pun S.H. Jensen G.S. Davis M.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2003; 14: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). After cellular association of nanoparticles to the target cells, particles are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (42Bellocq N.C. Pun S.H. Jensen G.S. Davis M.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2003; 14: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates that the uptake of nanoparticles carrying multiple functional domains (surface shielding particles Tf-PEG-PEI, tissue-specific promoter-driven Cre recombinase, and conditionally silenced plasmid) can overcome the intracellular barriers for successful delivery of the shRNA gene. We tested the effects of CD44v6 shRNA in vivo in a mouse model of human familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) where adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc) is mutated. Most FAP patients carry truncation mutations in the N-terminal half (44Miyoshi Y. Ando H. Nagase H. Nishisho I. Horii A. Miki Y. Mori T. Utsunomiya J. Baba S. Petersen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4452-4456Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Several mouse models of FAP were constructed either by chemical mutagenesis of the Apc gene at codon 850 (Apc Min/+ mouse) or by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells (knock-out strains) such as Apc 1638N, Apc 1638T, Apc 1309, Apc Δ716, and Apc Δ474 (45Fodde R. Smits R. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 369-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Germ line mutagenesis of C57BL/6J (B6) males was done by N-ethyl N-nitrosourea, and the offspring of mutated B6 × AKR/J (AKR) females yielded mice that carry 100% of an autosomal dominant mutation at codon 850 in the Apc gene. These five strains have mutated Apc alleles that encode truncated Apc proteins of 850, 1638, 1309, 716, and 474 amino acids, respectively. These variable truncated products form dimers with wild-type Apc protein and show variable dominant negative activities. As a result, the number of polyps varies in different strains. For example, the number of polyps at 16 weeks of age are ∼100 in Apc Min/+, Apc Δ474, and Apc 1309 mice. A much greater number of polyps (300-400) are found in Apc Δ716 mice, whereas much fewer polyps (∼10) are found in Apc 638N mice (46Sasai H. Masaki M. Wakitani K. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations in the Apc allele and the phenotype variability observed in FAP patients allowed the establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations at the Apc locus resulting in multiple intestinal adenomas throughout the length of the small and large intestine (47Moser A.R. Pitot H.C. Dove W.F. Science. 1990; 247: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most polyps are found in the small intestine, although a small but significant number of polyps develop in the colon, a phenotype different from human FAP. Despite this caveat, the Apc Min/+ mouse offers the prospect to study intestinal tumors that are of the same genetic background as the host. Strong up-regulations of CD44, including both CD44s and CD44v6 encoded epitopes, and of Cox-2 were observed in aberrant crypt foci in Apc Min/+ mice (48Wielenga V.J. van der Neut R. Offerhaus G.J. Pals S.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 169-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD44v proteins can form multimeric complexes in the plasma membrane, which dramatically enhances their HA binding capacity (11Sleeman J. Rudy W. Hofmann M. Moll J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, our results with Apc Min/+ mice confirm earlier findings that Tf-R is present at high levels in the tumor cells (42Bellocq N.C. Pun S.H. Jensen G.S. Davis M.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 2003; 14: 1122-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), which is crucial for active targeting of Tf-R by Tf-mediated CD44v6 shRNA delivery in tumor cells. For these reasons, the Apc Min/+ mouse model can be used for modulating adenoma growth by using HA-CD44v6 interaction antagonists as therapeutic agents in vivo. In this study we tested whether HA regulates Cox-2 via its effects on a CD44v6 → ErbB2 → Cox-2 axis in colon cancer cells. More importantly we provide evidence that systemic application of (pSico-CD44v6 shRNA plus pFabpl-Cre)/nanoparticles in the Apc Min/+ mouse model reduces intestinal tumor growth by perturbing CD44v6 containing isoform expression. Apc 10.1, an intestinal cell line, was derived from Apc Min/+ mice and retains the host heterozygous Apc genotype (50De Giovanni C. Landuzzi L. Nicoletti G. Astolfi A. Croci S. Micaroni M. Nanni P.

The palm domain, whose geometry is conserved in virtually all DNA and RNA polymerases, contains catalytic aspartic acids responsible for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction.

The thumb domain is connected to the palm domain by a β-hairpin termed the primer grip motif. The C-terminal region of the thumb protrudes toward the active site (3.Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The thumb binding inhibitors have been proposed to inhibit the RdRp activity of NS5B, perhaps by interfering with template/primer interaction and conformational dynamics of the protein (13.Di Marco S. Volpari C. Tomei L. Altamura S. Harper S. Narjes F. Koch U. Rowley M. De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. Carfi A. J. Biol.

Also, our understanding of the kinetics of NNI interaction with NS5B, the role of NNI binding and kinetics for inhibition, and the inhibitor efficacy on NS5B-resistant mutations remains incomplete. The four representative palm- and thumb-binding NNIs selected in this study have been reported to effectively inhibit replication of subgenomic replicons with low toxicity. Noncompetitive inhibition of NS5B polymerase activity with respect to NTPs has been reported (2.Beaulieu P.L. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2007; 8: 614-634PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Howe A.Y. Cheng H.

Based on co-crystallization studies with NS5B, it has been proposed that allosteric inhibitors may lock the NS5B protein in an inactive formation by binding tightly to the protein (16.Tomei L.

It is important to understand how the binding affinity relates to inhibition potency and resistance to HCV inhibition. Because the intrinsic potency of slowly binding compounds can be underestimated in the short time scale of biochemical studies, insights into slowly binding compounds may help to identify potent inhibitors. Moreover, the effect of the HCV RNA template on binding of NNIs to the enzyme-RNA complex remains to be addressed.Due to the error-prone nature of HCV polymerase in HCV replication, drug resistance can occur in patients who are treated with antiviral therapy directed at HCV-specific enzymes, and this resistance can limit their efficacy (16.Tomei L. Altamura S. Paonessa G. De Francesco R. Migliaccio G. Antiviral Chem. Chemother. 2005; 16: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Various in vitro studies using an HCV subgenomic replicon system have identified mutations that can confer resistance to inhibition by NNIs (2.Beaulieu P.L. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2007; 8: 614-634PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Howe A.Y. Cheng H. Johann S. Mullen S. Chunduru S.K. Young D.C. Bard J. Chopra R. Krishnamurthy G. Mansour T. O'Connell J. Antimicrob.

Chemother. 2005; 16: 225-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Many of the mutations produce cross-resistance to the same family of inhibitors, which will affect the design of optimal combination therapies. Achieving optimal and sustained binding of these antiviral agents to the NS5B polymerase is crucial to ensure a high probability of clinical success.In this work, we have used biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate binding affinities and binding kinetics of structurally diverse palm- and thumb-binding allosteric NS5B inhibitors. The binding of NNIs to wild-type and NNI-resistant NS5B proteins was studied and compared with inhibition and resistance. First, the NNI binding affinity for the NS5B protein was determined in the presence and absence of HCV RNA template, using a newly developed assay measuring the quenching of NS5B intrinsic fluorescence (FQ) in 96-well plates. The time-dependent NNI binding affinities and NNI binding equilibrium were used to identify slowly binding NNIs. Second, various palm and thumb site-specific mutant proteins were used to determine the mechanism of HCV resistance, and the binding affinities of NNIs were compared with the inhibition potencies determined in the HCV RdRp polymerase assay and HCV replicon assay. Finally, co-crystallization of HCV-796 with NS5B proteins from the Con1 and BK strains was performed to address the role of critical residues involved in HCV-796 resistance and NS5B polymorphism.DISCUSSIONThe NS5B polymerase represents an attractive target for the identification of antiviral agents to treat chronic HCV infection. The non-nucleoside inhibitors selected for this study have been shown to bind the palm or thumb binding sites and effectively inhibit replication of HCV subgenomic replicons (1.Beaulieu P.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2006; 9: 618-626PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Beaulieu P.L. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2007; 8: 614-634PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of NNI binding affinity to NS5B suggests a correlation of binding affinity with inhibitory potency of NNIs, in particular within a large set of palm binding compounds. Notably, this study identified HCV-796 as an unusual slow binding inhibitor of NS5B as compared with a large set of NNIs tested. In addition, the co-crystallization of NS5B and HCV-796 revealed a compound-induced binding pocket, consistent with slow binding kinetics of HCV-796.Several lines of evidence in this study establish that HCV-796 is a slow dissociation compound to NS5B. The binding kinetics of HCV-796 is different from those of the other three NNIs (Fig. 1). First, HCV-796 exhibited a time-dependent increase in NS5B binding affinity and slow binding equilibrium in the fluorescence quenching binding assay. Second, a slow dissociation rate constant on the order of 10−4/s was determined for the HCV-796/NS5B interaction in both fluorescence quenching and surface plasmon resonance experiments. In addition, HCV-796 showed slow binding kinetics of interaction with the NS5B-RNA complex. Although a clinical trial of HCV-796 was recently stopped due to elevation in liver enzymes, HCV-796 remains the first allosteric inhibitor shown to have significant antiviral potency in HCV-infected patients. Previously, a number of HCV protease inhibitors, including SCH-503034 and ITMN-191, were reported to be slow binding inhibitors (39.Malcolm B.A. Liu R. Lahser F. Agrawal S. Belanger B. Butkiewicz N.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8862-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Slow binding with slow dissociation is also a notable feature of non-nucleoside inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus (42.Spence R.A. Kati W.M. Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Science. 1995; 267: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Tight binding and a long dissociation half-life are hallmarks of slow binding inhibitors and are expected to provide pharmacological benefit with regard to sustained antiviral effects at the target site. A rapid screening system for the identification of slow binding inhibitors is therefore useful for early characterization of antiviral lead compounds.The co-crystal structure of HCV-796 with NS5B protein that was solved as part of this study supports the findings of slow binding kinetics and effects of resistance mutations on binding affinity of HCV-796. Relative to the apo crystal structure conformation of NS5B, the binding of HCV-796 causes multiple structural rearrangements, notably a rotamer shift of Arg200 and a setback of the primer grip loop backbone. These conformational changes induce the HCV-796 binding pocket formation. In contrast to the broad open surface exposed in the palm 1 binding pocket, this new palm 2 binding pocket is deep, narrow, and enclosed descending from the palm 1 binding site. HCV-796 and its structural variants, including HCV-086, display not only slow dissociation rate constants but also slow association constants (data not shown). Although some potent palm 1-binding compounds have been observed to have slow binding kinetics, the ubiquity of this characteristic for palm 2-binding compounds studied to date suggests that the NNI binding site in palm 2 has unique structural features. The deep enclosure within the core of the conserved and highly structured palm domain, featuring narrow entry and exit portals and further gating provided by Arg200 motions, may explain this slow binding. However, the slow binding of many compounds cannot be predicted based on the structures of binding pockets. In addition, compounds binding in the same pocket display different binding kinetics. A subtle movement or a minor conformational change in a side chain in a binding pocket may reverse the slow binding properties of a compound. Nevertheless, the slow binding of the HCV-796 series to the palm 2 binding site is unaffected by the binding of the HCV RNA template to NS5B. Moreover, the resistance mutations in this study, including C316N and C316Y, do not eliminate the slow binding properties of HCV-796. Therefore, the deep binding pocket in palm 2 is likely to contribute to the characteristically slow binding of HCV-796. The slow binding kinetics of HCV-796 were most pronounced in the Con1 strain. It is tempting to rationalize these data in light of the unique structural rearrangement of the C-terminal tail of that protein observed in the crystal structure. This rearrangement further narrows the only channel into or out of the binding site. However, further Con1 structures are needed to determine whether this structural shift represents an inherent predisposition of the Con1 sequence with accompanying physiological consequences, is simply an artifact of the novel crystal form, or is a coincidental arrangement of a putatively labile portion of the protein.The fluorescence quenching assay system could also be used for the assessment of RNA binding to NS5B and its impact on NNI binding. The NS5B protein has a substantially higher binding affinity to the 378-nt, full-length cIRES RNA than to the short, 21-nt 3′-end RNA of cIRES (Fig. 5A). This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of oligomerization of NS5B on longer RNA molecules to contribute to overall RNA binding affinity. An apparent binding affinity of ∼10 nm has previously been reported for the binding of NS5B to a 1442-nt RNA in a gel mobility shift assay (32.Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conversely, high dissociation constants have been reported for NS5B binding to short RNAs. A Kd of ∼250 nm for a 16-mer single-stranded RNA and a 13/16-mer double-stranded RNA substrate was measured by equilibrium fluorescence titration (43.Cramer J. Jaeger J. Restle T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3610-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In addition, a Kd of 420 nm was determined for a 14-mer RNA using fluorescence polarization (14.Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Bisbocci M. Bailey C. Bosserman M. Cellucci A. Forte E. Incitti I. Orsatti L. Koch U. De Francesco R. Olsen D.B. Carroll S.S. Migliaccio G. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38011-38019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These previous data are in agreement with our results. The long cIRES RNA therefore is likely to provide a substrate for the cooperative binding of NS5B protein. Note that the short 3′-end stem-loop structure of cIRES-21nt is sufficient to initiate the de novo synthesis of viral RNA, but the initiation is inefficient. It is conceivable that oligomerization-dependent, strong binding affinity of the NS5B enzyme for the full-length cIRES RNA also increases the efficiency of RNA replication initiation.The binding of RNA to NS5B did not appear to alter the structure of the palm 2 NNI binding pocket. cIRES RNA binding to NS5B shows minimal interference with the binding affinity of HCV-796 (Table 2). The slow binding kinetics of HCV-796 remains unchanged in the presence of RNA. The fact that HCV-796 maintained its high binding affinity to NS5B in the presence of HCV RNA (Table 2) indicates that RNA binding does not affect the initial binding of HCV-796 to NS5B. Although all compounds included in this study were either not affected or only moderately affected by RNA binding (TABLE 2, TABLE 3), we also found that certain structural classes of thumb-binding NNIs for NS5B were dramatically affected by RNA (data not shown). RNA contacts at the two thumb binding sites of NS5B have been demonstrated by co-crystallization and cross-linking studies (4.Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L. Mathieu M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38011-38019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Contacts between HCV RdRp and the RNA template have been reported to change during different steps in RNA-dependent RNA synthesis. The binding of RNA may therefore have a different effect on the thumb and palm subdomains. A significant movement of the thumb subdomain during the formation of the NS5B-RNA complex in HCV replication may alter NNI binding affinity. We are currently comparing the effects of HCV RNA on NNI binding to NS5B at thumb binding pockets with the effects at palm binding pockets.The NNI binding profile of wild-type and mutant NS5B proteins provides direct evidence of the site-specific binding by the palm and thumb binding compounds (Table 4). Because the resistance mutations cause consistent changes in Kd values of NS5B binding and in IC50 values of RdRp inhibition and replicon replication (Fig. 6), the binding profile from the high throughput FQ binding assay can be used to rapidly predict the binding site of novel leads and their resistance profile. The loss of binding affinity to mutant enzymes observed here was consistent with the emergence of site-specific resistance. We used a panel of NS5B recombinant proteins with characteristic mutations at palm binding sites (M414T and C316N) and thumb binding sites (L419M and P495L) in order to identify binding sites for novel allosteric inhibitors of NS5B (Table 4 and Fig. 7). Recently, changes in the IC50 value as a function of site mutation in NS5B were proposed to be useful for the early determination of NNI binding sites on NS5B (45.Pauwels F. Mostmans W. Quirynen L.M. van der Helm L. Boutton C.W. Rueff A.S. Cleiren E. Raboisson P. Surleraux D. Nyanguile O. Simmen K.A. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6909-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the use of a panel of site-specific NS5B mutant proteins in the binding assay like the one described here can be helpful for identifying binding pockets of allosteric inhibitors before co-crystal structures are available.Residue 316 of the NS5B enzyme is critical to resistance development against palm-binding compounds, such as NNI-1 and HCV-796, and there is also natural sequence polymorphism at this position, which may be clinically significant (8.Howe A.Y. Cheng H. Johann S. Mullen S. Chunduru S.K. Young D.C. Bard J. Chopra R. Krishnamurthy G. Mansour T. O'Connell J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2008; 52: 3327-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The introduction of the single mutation C316N in the Con1 protein reduces HCV-796 binding affinity to NS5B by 14-fold, which is comparable with the reduction in potency of polymerase inhibition and replication caused by the mutation. These results, coupled with the interaction between HCV-796 and the Asn316 residue of NS5B-BK in the co-crystal structure, which appear less energetically favorable than the interaction between the compound and C316 of NS5B-Con1, suggest that a single change at residue 316 of NS5B can cause profound changes in the efficacy of a compound (Fig. 8, A and B). Clinical selection of C316Y as the major HCV-796 resistance mutation was also consistent with a key role of Cys316 in HCV-796 binding affinity. C316Y caused a loss of ∼100-fold in binding affinity of the compound for the mutant NS5B as well as in the ability of the compound to inhibit the enzyme. The modeling of the large side chain of C316Y indicates a steric clash with HCV-796 (Fig. 8C). In addition, the single mutations C316Y and S365T were found to confer high resistance and reduced binding affinity of NNI-1 to palm 1 and of HCV-796 to palm 2. The fact that many single mutations identified in HCV replicon significantly affect compound binding and polymerase inhibition suggests a clinically significant low barrier to resistance for allosteric NNIs. The understanding of the mode of NNI binding and cross-resistance profiles between NNIs will help guide optimal combination therapies and the design of new compounds that retain binding affinity and activity against mutant NS5B variants.Although the reduced NNI binding affinity to NS5B results in major resistance effects and NNI polymorphisms, a few resistance mutations work by different mechanisms. For instance, the single mutation H95R has been reported as a resistance mutation of benzothiadiazine (14.Tomei L. Altamura S. Bartholomew L. Bisbocci M. Bailey C. Bosserman M. Cellucci A. Forte E.

H95R has been implicated in binding to the RNA template (6.O'Farrell D. Trowbridge R. Rowlands D. Jager J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed to affect the ability of the polymerase to recognize the viral genome. Further study of NNI binding to NS5B protein with RNA template is likely to address this hypothesis.HCV polymerase is a unique antiviral target that possesses at least four allosteric binding sites suitable for accommodating structurally diverse classes of antiviral compounds. Information regarding the mode of NNI binding has made important contributions to the development of potent inhibitors through compound screening and clinical development. With the focus of HCV drug discovery shifting toward the optimization of sustained binding affinity and higher resistance barriers in the development of potent inhibitors, detailed study of compound binding will facilitate selection of clinical leads. Evolution of NS5B allosteric inhibitors has shown promise for developing these compounds into clinical candidates. Combination treatment that includes HCV polymerase inhibitors will be required to counter the emergence of resistance and provide the best treatment coverage of the various genotypes and their respective subtypes of HCV.

Current therapies are unable to effectively eliminate viral infection in a significant number of patients.

GSs and SSs are members of the GT-B superfamily of glycosyl transferases (8Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol.

Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 9Bowles D. Isayenkova J. Lim E.-K. Poppenberger B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Glycosyl transferases and hydrolyzes are categorized as either retaining or inverting enzymes based on the stereochemical result of the reaction (8Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Although the inverting enzymes usually undergo reaction via an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state and are reasonably well understood mechanistically (10Lairson L.L. Withers S.G. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2004; 20: 2243-2248Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Ünligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) employed by the retaining enzymes are not as well understood. Although some retaining enzymes clearly use a double displacement mechanism, where the attack of an enzyme nucleophile results in a covalent intermediate (12Lairson L.L. Chiu C.P.C. Ly H.D. He S. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C.J. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28339-28344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), many of these enzymes do not appear to have such a nucleophile in their active sites. The simplest alternative is an Sn1-like mechanism, requiring an oxocarbenium cation intermediate (13Sinnott M.L. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2026-2032Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, a series of experiments have indicated such a cation to be quite unstable in solution (14Banait N.S. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7951-7958Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Banait N.S. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7958-7963Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Chiappe C. Moro G.L. Munforte P. Tetrahedron. 1997; 53: 10471-10478Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which has led to the proposal of an Sni-like (substitution nucleophilic internal return) mechanism (10Lairson L.L. Withers S.G. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2004; 20: 2243-2248Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Sinnott M.L. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2026-2032Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this mechanism attack of the nucleophile occurs on the same face as the departure of the leaving group, and at nearly the same time, thus avoiding a discrete cation intermediate. Interaction between nucleophile and leaving group is a hallmark of this mechanism. It is postulated that attack and departure occur “asynchronously” (10Lairson L.L. Withers S.G. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2004; 20: 2243-2248Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This mechanism has been suggested for several enzymes, including glycogen phosphorylase (GT-B, retaining) (17Klein H.W. Im M.J. Palm D. Eur. J. Biochem./FEBS. 1986; 157: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 18Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar), the first structure determined with the double Rossmann-fold domain architecture. Several structures of enzymes from the GT-B family have been determined where their C-domains contain the primary donor-binding site and their N-domains contain the primary acceptor binding site (19Patenaude S.I.

The active site of all of these enzymes lies in the cleft between the two domains and therefore the correct relative orientation of the two domains is required for correct active site geometry and catalytic competence (20Gibson R.P. Tarling C.A. Roberts S. Withers S.G. Davies G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1950-1955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Goldsmith E.J. Sprang S.R. Hamlin R.

Science. 1991; 254: 1367-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nowhere is this more critical than for GS enzymes, because they are characterized by a very large domain motion, much larger than that seen in any of the other GT-B retaining enzymes of known structure. The active site is therefore formed only upon closure of the two domains around the substrates. To date, there are two structures of GS, one from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (28Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin E.M. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (AtGS) and one from Pyrococcus abyssi (29Cristina H. Guinovart J.J. Fita I. Ferrer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2923-2931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (PaGS). However, both of these enzymes were crystallized in their catalytically inactive “open” conformations. To better understand both the structure and mechanism of GS, the GT-B enzyme family and retaining glycosyltransferases in general, we have determined a series of structures of GS from Escherichia coli. These structures include both the open, and for the first time the ADP/glucose-bound, closed form of the enzyme. Together, these structures give the clearest picture to date of the structure and function of GS and starch synthase enzymes. The wild-type EcGS (wtGS), mutant E. coli GS E377A, and double mutant C7S,C409S (dmGS) were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described elsewhere (30Yep A. Ballicora A.M. Sivak N.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8359-8367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were then buffer-exchanged to 20 mm triethanolamine-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol and concentrated to 5–8 mg/ml. All crystallizations were carried out at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method. All wtGS crystals were obtained by cocrystallization of 7.8 mg/ml protein with 3 mm ADP-Glc. Four independent data sets were collected from four different crystals of wtGS with ADP-Glc (wtGSa, wtGSb, wtGSc, and wtGSd). The wtGSa crystal (0.1 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm in size) was obtained after a 4-week incubation in a solution of 40% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m HEPPSO (pH 8.1) (Fig. 1A). The crystals of wtGSb and wtGSd grew in 40% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 m sodium tartrate, and 0.1 m HEPPSO (pH 7.7), and reached a maximum size 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.25 and 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm, respectively, over 12 weeks. The 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2-mm wtGSc crystal was also obtained after a 12-week incubation under similar conditions, but at pH 7.6. E. coli GS E377A + ADP-Glc complex crystals were obtained from a buffer containing 7.8 mg/ml protein, 3 mm ADP-Glc, 3 mm maltotriose, 40% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 0.1 m HEPPSO (pH 7.5). After 16 weeks incubation, the crystals grew to 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm and were used for data collection. Crystals of dmGS were obtained in the presence of 0.54 mm ADP-Glc in 40% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5), and 0.2 m sodium tartrate buffer. The crystal used for data collection had been incubated for 16 weeks before reaching its maximum size at 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm. All crystals were harvested into the mother liquid with 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant and flash-frozen for 100 K data collection at the Advance Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories (Argonne, IL). Diffraction data were reduced and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar, 32Howard A.J. Bourne P.E. Watenpaugh K.D. Crystallographic Computing 7: Proceedings from the Macromolecular Crystallographic Computing School. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 1-12Google Scholar). The dmGS crystal belongs to the H32 space group with unit cell parameters a = b = 232.96 Å, c = 85.54 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. All other GS crystals belong to space group I41 with unit cell parameters a = b = 126 ± 1.0 Å, c = 152 ± 1.0 Å, α = β = γ = 90°. In all cases, only one molecule was found in each asymmetric unit.

Open table in a new tab b ACT, acetate ion; PEG, polyethylene glycol chain. The structures of dmGS and wtGSb were solved by the Molecular Replacement method with MOLREP (Collaborative Computational Project, CCP4) using the AtGS structure as a search model, with non-conserved amino acid residues mutated to alanine, except for glycine. Initially, plausible rotation and translation functions for the N terminus (1–240) were identified, and the C terminus (271–456) was subsequently incorporated to search for its counterpart. All other EcGS complex structures were solved by the Molecular Replacement method with MOLREP using the wtGSb structure as model. Placement of the model was optimized by rigid-body refinement. Refinement and map calculations were carried out with the program REFMAC5 (CCP4). All model building was performed using TURBO-FRODO. After convergence, the ligands HEPPSO, ADP, and glucose were incorporated using refinement dictionaries calculated from the ideal structure provided by the CCP4 dictionary. Water molecules were added using the ARP/wARP option within REFMAC5 and inspected visually prior to deposition. In all data sets, 5% of the observations were flagged as “free” (33Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar) and used to monitor RFree. All final models display good stereochemistry as evaluated with the program PROCHECK (CCP4 with less than 0.3% of the residues in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plots). All figures were generated with PyMOL (34Delano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment was conducted with DNASTAR. GS sequences used were: EcGS (P0A6U8), AtGS (AAD03474), and PaGS (NP_125769). Sequences of granule-bound starch synthases from various organisms were those of barley (AAL77109), maize (P04713), potato (CAA41359), and rice (P19395). Soluble starch synthases used were maize SSI (AAB99957), potato SSI (P93568), wheat SSI (Q43654), wheat SSIIa (BAE48798), maize SSIIa (AAS77569), potato SSII (CAA61241), potato SSIII (Q43846), wheat SSIII (AAF87999), and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii SS. A total of four distinct structures are reported here: an apo, open form; a closed form, wtGS bound to ADP, glucose, and HEPPSO; wtGS bound to ADP, an unidentified glucose derivative; and HEPPSO and E. coli GS E377A bound to ADP and HEPPSO. The double mutant dmGS (C7S,C408S) was used as a wild-type EcGS alternative in crystallization trials because EcGS had shown a tendency to aggregate, and it was thought that a cysteine-less form might be more suitable for crystallization. Of the three Cys residues present in EcGS, Cys-379 was maintained because its replacement by Ser affects the apparent affinity for ADP-Glc. The variant dmGS exhibits comparable specific activity and apparent affinity for ADP-Glc to wtGS (30Yep A. Ballicora A.M. Sivak N.M. Preiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8359-8367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). C7S and C408S are not close to the active site and are separately buried in the protein structure (Fig. 1A), suggesting that this double mutation had little impact on the enzyme structure. EcGS is a 52.8-kDa protein with a total of 477 residues and is monomeric in all of our crystals. In contrast, the oligomerization state for the archael GS and AtGS was dimer and trimer, respectively. An early report indicated that active EcGS could be isolated in a variety of oligomerization states (35Fox J. Kawaguchi K. Greenberg E. Preiss J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The density map of apo-dmGS shows the first 475 residues. The His6 tag attached to the C terminus of wtGS was not traceable. A typical twin-Rossmann GT-B fold is exhibited by all the EcGS structures; the N- and C-terminal domains are similar in size (1–241 and 250–457) and are composed of a “sandwich” of parallel β-sheets between α-helices. The two domains are structurally homologous (r.m.s. deviation 1.9 Å), although there is no sequence homology between them. The extended interdomain linker peptide-(242–254) connects the N- and C-terminal halves. The helical tail α18-(458–476) crosses over from the C-terminal domain to pack against the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with previously reported AtGS (28Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin E.M. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and PaGS (29Cristina H. Guinovart J.J. Fita I. Ferrer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2923-2931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) structures. There are two major forms of EcGS: an open form with the two domains spread relatively far apart, and a closed form in which the two domains are very close together. Although the apo-dmGS structure adopts the open form, the rest of our structures represent the catalytically active, closed form of the enzyme (Fig. 1C). The N- and C-terminal halves of apo-dmGS are separated by a deep cleft with most interdomain interactions occurring between the N-terminal helix α7-(215–220), the preceding loop (212–215), and the C-terminal helix α14-(398–403). Val-248 in the linker peptide also makes one interdomain hydrogen bond with Phe-460 in the domain-spanning helix α18 (Fig. 1B). wtGS was co-crystallized with the donor substrate ADP-Glc. Crystals grew and were harvested and frozen at two time points, 4 and 12 weeks. Even at the earliest time point (4 weeks, wtGSa) ADP-Glc was not observed in the active site. Instead, ADP and a not precisely identified glucose derivative were found. ADP-Glc was clearly not present because there was no electron density for the bond between the sugar ring and the terminal phosphate oxygen of ADP, and the distance between the glucose moiety and the phosphate oxygen was 3.5–3.6 Å, much too long to accommodate a covalent bond between the two atoms. Then again, no electron density was evident for an additional substituent on the C1 carbon, indicating that glucose was not present (Fig. 1D). Data from crystals that were harvested after 12 weeks also have electron density maps consistent with the presence of ADP and a glucose derivative with no covalent bond between them, but these crystals clearly show density for an additional oxygen atom attached to C1 of the glucose moiety, consistent with the presence of ADP and the hydrolysis product glucose in the active site (Fig. 1D). Three separate data sets were collected from three crystals after 12 weeks (wtGSb, wtGSc, and wtGSd) all showing the same glucose moiety in the active site. In all four of these structures, the two domains of GS have closed around the molecules in the active site, resulting in a 15.2° motion of the C-terminal domain relative to the N-terminal domain (Fig. 1C, all four structures are superimposable and only wtGSb is shown as representative). Most of the interdomain interactions seen in the open form are preserved in the closed form. Additionally, the closed form is stabilized by new interdomain interactions, including those between Asn-162 and Gln-304, and between Lys-15 and Glu-357. Superposition of the C-terminal domain of the apo-dmGS and the ADP, glucose-bound wtGS structures revealed that displacement of the N-terminal domain is as much as 9.3 Å (Fig. 1C). However, the r.m.s. deviation between the N-terminal domains (the α-carbon atoms of residues 1–241) and the C-terminal domains (α-carbon atoms of residues 251–375 and 382–477) are only 0.68 and 0.61 Å, respectively, indicating a rigid global domain-domain movement. The program DynDom (36Qi G. Lee R. Hayward S. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2832-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) revealed that a 15.2° domain-domain closure switches the open apo-GS structure to the closed form. The open form of GS has been reported for AtGS (28Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin E.M. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M.

However, the open form of apo-AtGS is 10.2° more open than the E. coli apo-dmGS structure, perhaps due to crystal packing or to species specificity or both. The structure of wtGS in complex with ADP, glucose, and HEPPSO shows the compact, closed form with a narrow cleft at the N- and C-domain interface, which serves as the binding pocket of the substrate. In addition to the global domain-domain rotation, superposition of the C-terminal domain of the apo-dmGS on to the ADP/glucose-bound wtGS also revealed local conformational rearrangements, most of which are small side chain movements on the N- and C- terminal domain interface. The only conspicuous local conformational change was found in the loop 376–381 (Fig. 1C). The entire loop flips down to avoid collision with the glucose moiety. Still in proximity, this loop makes extensive interactions with the glucose to be transferred. The conformational change of loop 376–381 also establishes the interdomain hydrogen bond between the conserved Ser-212 side chain and the Pro-378 backbone carbonyl group as well as packing between Tyr-215 and Pro-378, making it likely that domain closure and loop motion are correlated. ADP is similarly located in all four wtGS co-complexes with virtually identical interactions observed between the protein and the ADP molecule. ADP is bound in the wtGS interdomain cleft, mostly along the C-terminal domain wall and makes interactions with several C-terminal domain residues. The adenine moiety extensively interacts with the C-terminal 354–356 loop; the adenine ring stacks against the conserved Tyr-355 (Phe in animal GS and plant SS) (Table 2; Fig. 2A). The adenine N1 atom accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of His-356 (3.1 Å), and the adenine amide N6 contacts the Gly-354 backbone carboxyl (2.9 Å). The interaction of ADP with the N-terminal domain is restricted to Asp-21, Lys-15, and Gly-18, all of which are absolutely conserved in both glycogen and starch synthases. The fact that ADP makes interactions with both the C- and N-terminal domains of GS could lead to the conclusion that ADP binding may be enough to produce the closed conformation of GS. However, this is not the case because the AtGS-ADP complex is still in the open form (28Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin E.M. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A. Alzari P.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As will be explained below, the binding of HEPPSO in the glycan acceptor binding site appears also to be required for maintenance of the closed conformation.TABLE 2Partial alignment of conserved residues in bacterial GS and plant SS Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2A, stereo views of ADP and glucose (shown in yellow and in atom colors) bound in the active site of EcGS.

A water-mediated hydrogen bond between the ribose 2′-hydroxyl and the adenine N3 atom was found in all wtGS structures, presumably reinforcing the observed ribose orientation. The ribose O3′ hydroxyl group makes hydrogen bonds with both OD2 of Asp-21 (2.8 Å) and N-ϵ of Lys-15 (2.7 Å). The ADP phosphate groups are tucked back with respect to the adenine base, allowing Gly-18 to make a hydrogen bond with O5* of ADP (3.2 Å) and O3B of the distal phosphate group (2.7 Å) (Fig. 2A). The proximal phosphate is near the conserved loop 374–381 and both phosphate O1A and O2A make hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide of Leu-381 (3.3 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively). The O2A atom of the proximal phosphate is also hydrogen-bonded to the Thr-382 backbone amide (3.2 Å). The distal phosphate group is close to loop 299–306 and interacts extensively with Arg-300 and Lys-305 through ionic interaction, direct hydrogen bonds, and water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2, B and C). Arg-300 makes a hydrogen bond with O1B and O2B of the distal phosphate with its N-η (2.8 Å) and N-ϵ (2.8 Å) atoms, respectively. A water molecule mediates an additional interaction between the Arg-300 backbone amide and the distal phosphate O2B atom. Lys-305 makes a 2.8-Å hydrogen bond to the distal phosphate O1B through its N-ϵ group, which is also in contact with the proximal phosphate O3A atom (3.0 Å). The interaction between Lys-305 and the proximal phosphate also includes two water-mediated hydrogen bonds between its N-ϵ atom and the proximal phosphate O3A and O2A (Fig. 2B). The different density maps of wtGS structures all showed considerable gaps between the distal phosphate oxygen and the anomeric carbon of the glucose moiety of ADP, indicating that the phosphate-glucosyl bond had been broken. A glucose molecule is found in the active sites of wtGSb (refined to 2.2-Å resolution), wtGSc (refined to 2.3-Å resolution), and wtGSd (refined to 2.4-Å resolution). Because the glucose positions in wtGSb, wtGSc, and wtGSd are almost identical, the highest resolution structure, wtGSb (2.2 Å), will be used to desc"
https://openalex.org/W2047814115,"Here, we investigated the importance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) as a retinyl ester hydrolase (REH). REH activity was measured in vitro using recombinant HSL and retinyl palmitate. The expression of retinoic acid (RA)-regulated genes and retinoid metabolites were measured in high-fat diet fed HSL-null mice using real-time quantitative PCR and triple-stage liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Age- and gender-matched wild-type littermates were used as controls. The REH activity of rat HSL was found to be higher than that against the hitherto best known HSL substrate, i.e., diacylglycerols. REH activity in white adipose tissue (WAT) of HSL-null mice was completely blunted and accompanied by increased levels of retinyl esters and decreased levels of retinol, retinaldehyde and all-trans RA. Accordingly, genes known to be positively regulated by RA were down-regulated in HSL-null mice, including pRb and RIP140, key factors promoting differentiation into the white over the brown adipocyte lineage. Dietary RA supplementation partly restored WAT mass and the expression of RA-regulated genes in WAT of HSL-null mice. These findings demonstrate the importance of HSL as an REH of adipose tissue and suggest that HSL via this action provides RA and other retinoids for signaling events that are crucial for adipocyte differentiation and lineage commitment."
https://openalex.org/W1977972762,"Wnt-5a is a non-transforming Wnt protein that is implicated in cell polarity, adhesion, and motility. We have previously shown that low expression of Wnt-5a is a predictor of shorter disease-free survival in human breast cancer. Here, we investigated whether β-catenin/E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion was affected by loss of Wnt-5a in breast carcinomas, thereby promoting a metastatic behavior of the tumor. We show that Wnt-5a stimulation of human breast epithelial cells leads to an increased Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, Wnt-5a/casein kinase Iα (CKIα)-specific Ser-45 phosphorylation of β-catenin is associated with an increased complex formation of β-catenin/E-cadherin. Mutation of Ser-45 decreases the β-catenin/E-cadherin association. Also, the inhibitory effect of Wnt-5a on breast epithelial cell invasion is reduced upon mutation of β-catenin-Ser-45. The Wnt-5a-CKIα-induced Ser-45 phosphorylation does not lead to degradation of β-catenin. Finally we show that human breast cancers lacking Wnt-5a protein have a significantly lower level of membrane-associated β-catenin. Down-regulation of Wnt-5a expression and subsequent reduction of membrane-associated β-catenin in invasive breast cancer, can therefore contribute to a decreased cell-cell adhesion and increased motility resulting in a higher probability for metastatic disease.

In a normal mammary gland the ducts are lined with epithelial cells that are both interconnected and connected to the basement membrane. Mutations in genes encoding adhesion molecules have been implicated in the progression of breast cancer (1Osborne M.P. Breast Anatomy and Development.Philadelphia, PA. 2000; Google Scholar). E-cadherin is a transmembrane, calcium (Ca2+)-dependent adhesion molecule that connects adjacent epithelial cells. The loss of cell-cell adhesion at the original tumor site has been suggested to be related to the loss of E-cadherin expression or function in many epithelial cancers (2Berx G. Nollet F. van Roy F. Cell Adhes. Commun... 1998; 6: 171-184Google Scholar). The E-cadherins are dynamically linked to the cytoskeleton via β-catenin, plakoglobin, p120, and α-catenin (3Drees F. Pokutta S. Yamada S. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell.. 2005; 123: 903-915Google Scholar, 4Yamada S. Pokutta S. Drees F. Weis W.I. Nelson W.J. Cell.. 2005; 123: 889-901Google Scholar). Mutations in the E-cadherin gene are frequent in invasive lobular breast cancers, whereas they are absent or might occur at a low frequency in the more common invasive ductal breast carcinomas (5Lei H. Sjoberg-Margolin S. Salahshor S. Werelius B. Jandakova E. Hemminki K. Lindblom A. Vorechovsky I. Int. J. Cancer.. 2002; 98: 199-204Google Scholar). Despite this, a low membrane expression of β-catenin was recently shown to be associated with a poor outcome in human breast cancer patients (6Dolled-Filhart M. McCabe A. Giltnane J. Cregger M. Camp R.L. Rimm D.L. Cancer Res... 2006; 66: 5487-5494Google Scholar). The question as to whether Wnt β-catenin signaling can affect E-cadherin-dependent cellular adhesion, or vice versa, has long been debated (7Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science.. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Google Scholar). β-Catenin plays a role both in the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex and as a transcriptional regulator in the nucleus upon canonical Wnt signaling (reviewed in Ref. 8Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Physiol. (Bethesda).. 2007; 22: 303-309Google Scholar). There are therefore three different pools of β-catenin; a membrane bound, a cytoplasmic that is constantly being phosphorylated and targeted for ubiquitination and degradation, and a nuclear unphosphorylated form. It has previously been suggested that β-catenin targeted to adhesive or transcriptional complexes have distinct molecular forms that would allow it to coordinate the two processes (9Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol... 2004; 167: 339-349Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that target β-catenin to adhesive complexes have not yet been described. It is known that the association between β-catenin/E-cadherin is increased when E-cadherin is phosphorylated on serine residues 834, 836, and 842 (8Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Physiol. (Bethesda).. 2007; 22: 303-309Google Scholar). GSK-3β 2The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β; CK, casein kinase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; rWnt-5a, recombinant Wnt-5a. and CK2 have been implicated as potential kinases. In contrast, phosphorylation of serine 846 by CKI and tyrosine phosphorylation of both E-cadherin and β-catenin has been suggested to decrease the association (10Hu P. O'Keefe E.J. Rubenstein D.S. J. Investig. Dermatol... 2001; 117: 1059-1067Google Scholar, 11Dupre-Crochet S. Figueroa A. Hogan C. Ferber E.C. Bialucha C.U. Adams J. Richardson E.C. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 3804-3816Google Scholar), although conflicting data are present (12Catimel B. Layton M. Church N. Ross J. Condron M. Faux M. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Anal. Biochem... 2006; 357: 277-288Google Scholar). Still, there is little evidence concerning β-catenin phosphorylation and E-cadherin association. In a recent review (8Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Physiol. (Bethesda).. 2007; 22: 303-309Google Scholar) it was suggested that the interaction might be affected by Wnt signals because the CK1, CK2, and GSK-3β kinases are part of this pathway. Members of the Wnt family are signaling proteins that are involved in many differentiation events (13Bienz M. Curr. Biol... 2005; 15: R64-R67Google Scholar). They can be divided into three different classes based on experiments performed in C57MG mammary myoepithelial cells (14Shimizu H. Julius M.A. Giarre M. Zheng Z. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Cell Growth & Differ... 1997; 8: 1349-1358Google Scholar), the transforming (Wnt-1, Wnt-2, Wnt-3, and Wnt-3a), the weakly transforming (Wnt-6 and Wnt-7a), and the non-transforming group (Wnt-4, Wnt-5a, Wnt-5b, and Wnt-7b). The transforming Wnt proteins signal via the canonical β-catenin pathway and activate TCF/LEF-dependent transcription. In the absence of a Wnt signal, β-catenin is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by a complex consisting of CKIα, GSK-3β, APC, and Axin (APC-Axin-destruction complex) (15Kimelman D. Xu W. Oncogene.. 2006; 25: 7482-7491Google Scholar). Upon Wnt signaling this complex is inactivated and β-catenin is accumulated in the cytosol, thereby leading to nuclear redistribution (7Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science.. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Google Scholar). In the present study we will focus on the role of the nontransforming Wnt-5a. Wnt-5a primarily activates distinct noncanonical pathways, including the Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway (16Dejmek J. Safholm A. Kamp Nielsen C. Andersson T. Leandersson K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 6024-6036Google Scholar). The Wnt-5a protein has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion, motility, and polarity (17Moon R.T. Campbell R.M. Christian J.L. McGrew L.L. Shih J. Fraser S. Development.. 1993; 119: 97-111Google Scholar, 18Pandur P. Maurus D. Kuhl M. Bioessays.. 2002; 24: 881-884Google Scholar), processes that are known to relate to the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex. We have previously shown that expression of Wnt-5a is a prognostic factor for longer disease-free survival in human breast cancer (19Jonsson M. Dejmek J. Bendahl P.O. Andersson T. Cancer Res... 2002; 62: 409-416Google Scholar, 20Dejmek J. Leandersson K. Manjer J. Bjartell A. Emdin S.O. Vogel W.F. Landberg G. Andersson T. Clin. Cancer Res... 2005; 11: 520-528Google Scholar). It was further shown that a low Wnt-5a expression led to a decreased adherence of the cells to collagen and increased motility of ductal breast epithelial cells (21Jonsson M. Andersson T. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 2043-2053Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that loss of Wnt-5a protein expression might be involved in the initial de-adhesion events of metastasis in invasive breast carcinomas. The role for Wnt-5a as a prognostic marker has now been confirmed in several other cancers (22Dejmek J. Dejmek A. Safholm A. Sjolander A. Andersson T. Cancer Res... 2005; 65: 9142-9146Google Scholar, 23Blanc E. Roux G.L. Benard J. Raguenez G. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 1277-1283Google Scholar-24Kremenevskaja N. von Wasielewski R. Rao A.S. Schofl C. Andersson T. Brabant G. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 2144-2154Google Scholar). However, the present available data concerning how Wnt-5a affects Ca2+-dependent intercellular adhesion (E-cadherin) (25Torres M.A. Yang-Snyder J.A. Purcell S.M. DeMarais A.A. McGrew L.L. Moon R.T. J. Cell Biol... 1996; 133: 1123-1137Google Scholar), does not match the clinical findings. In this study we show that in contrast to previous data, but in line with clinical findings, the non-transforming Wnt-5a protein actually increases the Ca2+-dependent intercellular adhesion in human breast epithelial cells by affecting the cellular distribution and function of β-catenin. Cell Culture—We used the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and the non-cancerous mammary epithelial cell line HB2, which is a subclone of the MTSV-7 cell line originating from the laboratory of Dr. J. Taylor-Papadimitriou (ICRF, UK) and 4T1 mouse mammary cancer cells (from ATCC). The following clones, which had previously been produced in our laboratory (21Jonsson M. Andersson T. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 2043-2053Google Scholar) were used: Wnt-5a, overexpressing cells stably transfected with a pLNCX Wnt-5a-HA vector (Wnt-5ahigh HB2 or MCF-7 cells), Wnt-5a-antisense cells obtained by transfecting with a pLNCX vector containing the Wnt-5a cDNA in the antisense direction (3′-5′; Wnt-5alow HB2 cells). Chemicals and Reagents—Antibodies directed toward Ser(P)-45 and Ser(P)-33/37/41 β-catenin were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), anti-β-catenin and E-cadherin from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ), the anti-E-cadherin antibody for immunoprecipitations and immunofluorescence was clone SHE 78-7 from Axxora (Takara, Shiga, Japan), anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-pan phospho-Ser/Thr (BD Transduction Laboratories) and G410 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from Upstate Biotech Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The polyclonal rabbit anti-human Wnt-5a antibody was developed in our laboratory (19Jonsson M. Dejmek J. Bendahl P.O. Andersson T. Cancer Res... 2002; 62: 409-416Google Scholar). Recombinant Wnt-5a (rWnt-5a) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and was used at a concentration of 1.2 μg/ml for the times indicated on serum-starved cells. The α-E-catenin, CKIα, and Axin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (CA) as was the casein kinase 1 α/ϵ inhibitor IC261 that was used at 50 μm 1.5 h after the addition of rWnt-5a (a total of 1 h). The protease inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al also known as MG132 (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 μm for 5 h prior to cell lysis, and the protease inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 mm in the lysis buffer. Tumor Samples—Samples were collected from primary tumors that had been removed from 94 consecutive patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Of the 94 tumors, 85 were ductal, four mucinous, two medullar, and three lobular. According to the classification system of the International Union against Cancer, 23 patients had stage I, 56 patients stage II, one patient stage III, and six patients stage IV breast carcinomas. In eight patients, the stage of the disease was not known due to a lack of data on tumor size or axillary node status. None of the patients had received radiation treatment or chemotherapy before surgery. Tissue samples were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and used for routine morphological examination (grading and immunostaining) and construction of tumor tissue arrays. To ensure that clearly defined areas of malignant tissue were used in the arrays, for each tumor sample, a slide with a fresh tissue section was prepared from the paraffin block and stained with hematoxylin. Areas including representative tumor cells were identified and marked, and two biopsies (Ø 0.6 mm (diameter)) corresponding to the marked areas on the slide were taken from each paraffin block. These biopsies were remounted in a new paraffin block in a tissue array machine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Becher Instruments, MD). At the time of analysis of membrane-associated β-catenin, 24 random tumors were lost from the paraffin block and thus 70 tumors were left to analyze. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (20Dejmek J. Leandersson K. Manjer J. Bjartell A. Emdin S.O. Vogel W.F. Landberg G. Andersson T. Clin. Cancer Res... 2005; 11: 520-528Google Scholar). The antibodies were Wnt-5a (19Jonsson M. Dejmek J. Bendahl P.O. Andersson T. Cancer Res... 2002; 62: 409-416Google Scholar) and β-catenin (Sigma). Two independent observers (G. L. and C. M.), with no knowledge of the clinical outcome, evaluated the stained slides. The tumors were graded based on the intensity of the staining: for Wnt-5a (0, 1, 2, and 3) immunoreactivity equivalent to that seen in: 3, normal epithelial cells; 2, immunoreactivity moderately decreased; 1, weak immunoreactivity; 0, no immunoreactivity; and for membrane-associated β-catenin (0, 1, 2, and 3); 3, high immunoreactivity in the membrane; 2, normal immunoreactivity; 1, immunoreactivity moderately decreased; 0, weak immunoreactivity (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). In the histogram (Fig. 1A) the gradings (0 and 1) were viewed as β-cateninlow tumors and gradings (2 and 3) as β-cateninhigh tumors. For statistical analysis a Chi-square test was used and the linear to linear association between Wnt-5a and membrane-bound β-catenin was assessed.Table 1Wnt-5a protein levels in relation to membrane-associated β-catenin levels in a total of 70 primary breast cancers β-Catenin in Membrane Wnt-5a Total p 0 1 2 3 0 4 8 2 0 14 1 5 5 2 0 12 2 3 15 8 3 29 3 1 6 7 1 15 Total 13 34 19 4 70 0.004 Open table in a new tab Membrane Fractionations—Adherent cells were lysed and incubated for 30 min in 350 μl of lysis buffer A containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 2 mm MgCl2 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Na3VO4, 0.6 mm pefabloc, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were further lysed with a homogenizer 25 times and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatants were collected, centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and collected again and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, before ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 200,000 × g. The pellets (plasma membrane) were suspended in lysis buffer A and the protein concentrations were measured. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Adherent cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm pefabloc. For immunoprecipitations, Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and the lysates were precleared for 30 min. Thereafter specific antibodies were added for 5 min prior to addition of new Protein A-Sepharose beads with incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed six times in Hepes, pH 7.5, wash buffer with 1 mm Na3VO4. Transient Transfections—Wnt-5alow and Wnt-5ahigh HB2 or MCF-7 cells were transfected with Oligofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the TOP/FOPflash (Upstate Biotechnology) experiments each transfection was cotransfected with 0.2 μg of cytomegalovirus-controlled Renilla reporter gene. Luciferase assays were performed with a Dual Luciferase™ Reporter Assay System (Promega). For the FLAG immunoprecipitation experiments wild type β-catenin, Ser-45Δβ-catenin, and Ser-33Δβ-catenin, kindly provided by Professor David Rimm, were used. At the end of the transfection the cells were either left untreated or stimulated with rWnt-5a (20 nm; R&D Systems) as indicated, and subsequently immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The coprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blots using E-cadherin and β-catenin-specific antibodies. The kinase-deficient CKIα mutants pCS2-CKIα2-K46A, pCS2-CKIα2-D136N, and pCS2-CKIα2-D136N-K138E were kind gifts from Professor Jiandong Chen (26Chen L. Li C. Pan Y. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 6509-6520Google Scholar). Pulse-Chase—Wnt-5alow HB2 cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and then washed and incubated in methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 4 mm l-glutamine, 10 mm Hepes, and 20 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine-stabilized aqueous solution, Easy tag (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 h. Thereafter cold DMEM plus 2 mm methionine were added. Cells were stimulated with rWnt-5a, LiCl, and harvested after 0 and 2 h. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against β-catenin. Radiolabeled β-catenin was visualized and quantified using a Fuji LAS3000 phosphorimager and Multigauge software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescence—Wnt-5ahigh or Wnt-5alow cells were seeded on glass coverslips. The cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Staining was done with anti-E-cadherin (SHE 78-7), anti-β-catenin or isotype control antibodies in 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline and with secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488. The coverslips were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO A/S), and examined and photographed in a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope, using a ×60 objective. Images were recorded with a scientific-grade, charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) and analyzed with HazeBuster deconvolution software (VayTek, Inc., Fairland, CT). Cell Aggregation—Wnt-5ahigh or Wnt-5alow HB2 cells were detached by treatment with Versene. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in Ca2+ low (10 μm CaCl2; DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) or Ca2+ high (1.8 mm CaCl2; DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum) medium. Approximately 5 × 106 cells/ml and sample were rocked gently in an Eppendorf tube for 1 h in a normal cell incubator. The cells were then poured into a 12-well plate and viewed under a light microscope. Approximately 1500 cells were counted from each well and the number of aggregates was estimated. 200 μl was taken from each sample and propidium iodide was added for 20 min prior to analysis using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (n = 6, standard bars = S.E.). Ca2+-induced Cell-Cell Adhesion—Confluent Wnt-5alow HB2 cells were quickly washed with Versene and subsequently with Ca2+ low medium (10 μm CaCl2; DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2). The cells were viewed under a microscope to assure that the cell-cell contacts were disrupted (∼1 min). Thereafter Ca2+ high (1.8 mm CaCl2; DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum) medium was added to the cells in the presence or absence of rWnt-5a and incubated for 1 h prior to lysis. In the wells containing Ca2+ high medium the cell-cell contacts had clearly been re-established during this time, whereas in the control wells with Ca2+ low medium no cell-cell contacts were present. Matrigel Invasion Assays—Invasion assays were carried out using Matrigel invasion chambers (BD) with 8.0-μm pore size membranes in 24-well plates. Transiently transfected (48 h) Wnt-5alow HB2 cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells per ml in serum-free culture media. Serum containing medium (10% fetal calf serum) was added to the lower well and 0.5 ml (2.5 × 105 cells) of the cell suspension, containing recombinant Wnt-5a (0.8 μg/ml) where indicated, was added to the invasion chamber, and the cells were allowed to invade for 72 h. Cells that had invaded through the Matrigel were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), stained with crystal violet (Sigma), and counted. The lower wells were always checked for cells to ensure that the experiments were stopped at the appropriate time. Transfection procedures were as described above, and the transfection efficiency (FLAG-β-catenin) and endogenous levels of β-catenin were evaluated using Western blot of β-catenin on 6% SDS gels. Wnt-5a Increases the Intercellular Adhesion in Human Breast Epithelial Cells—To experimentally investigate the effects of Wnt-5a on Ca2+-dependent intercellular adhesion in human ductal breast epithelial cells, we initially investigated whether Wnt-5a signaling affected intercellular adhesion of a non-cancerous ductal breast epithelial cell line (HB2, see ""Experimental Procedures”) that was either stably transfected with antisense Wnt-5a (HB2 Wnt-5alow) or with Wnt-5a (HB2 Wnt-5ahigh) (21Jonsson M. Andersson T. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 2043-2053Google Scholar). To this end, we analyzed the fraction of large cell aggregates formed upon slow rocking of single cell suspensions in Ca2+-depleted and Ca2+-containing medium for 1 h (Fig. 1A, Ca2+low and Ca2+high). We found that Wnt-5ahigh HB2 cells formed more aggregates as compared with Wnt-5alow HB2 cells in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 1A) without affecting the amount of dead cells (data not shown). Wnt-5a Induces β-Catenin Membrane Association—To investigate whether the Wnt-5a-induced increase in intercellular adhesion was mediated by the β-catenin/E-cadherin complex we analyzed the membrane association of β-catenin in human breast epithelial cells using immunofluorescense with β-catenin-specific antibodies. We used two cell lines, the non-cancerous human ductal breast epithelial cell line (HB2) and the MCF-7 ductal breast cancer cell line, that again were either stably transfected with antisense Wnt-5a (HB2 Wnt-5alow) or with Wnt-5a (HB2 Wnt-5ahigh and MCF-7high) (21Jonsson M. Andersson T. J. Cell Sci... 2001; 114: 2043-2053Google Scholar). All experiments were confirmed by using recombinant Wnt-5a (rWnt-5a). The advantage of using both Wnt-5a overexpressing cells (HB2 Wnt-5ahigh and MCF-7high cells) and stimulating HB2 Wnt-5alow cells with rWnt-5a is that the overexpressing cells have a continuous release of Wnt-5a, whereas a prompt rWnt-5a treatment give us a better opportunity to directly analyze Wnt-5a-specific cell signaling cascades. Interestingly, in HB2 Wnt-5ahigh cells and in HB2 Wnt-5alow cells that were treated with rWnt-5a (2.5 h), the increase in membrane-associated β-catenin was substantial (Fig. 1B). Wnt-5a treatment also led to an altered morphology of the cells with membrane protrusions, suggesting initiation of intercellular contacts (Figs. 1B and 2A). We did not detect significant differences in nuclear β-catenin (Fig. 1B). Also in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7, an increased membrane association of β-catenin was found upon Wnt-5a expression (MCF-7high) or treatment with rWnt-5a (Fig. 1B, lower panel). The same results were obtained using immunofluorescence with E-cadherin-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). We next performed membrane fractionations using α-tubulin as a control for the cytosolic fractions and caveolin as control for the membrane fractions (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B, the levels of β-catenin in the cell membrane were significantly elevated in HB2 Wnt-5ahigh cells compared with HB2 Wnt-5alow cells. When the membrane fractions were analyzed for E-cadherin we found a profound increase in the levels of membrane-associated E-cadherin (Fig. 2B). Neither the protein nor mRNA levels of β-catenin or E-cadherin were affected by a short (2.5 h) stimulation with rWnt-5a in human breast epithelial cells. This indicates that the increased membrane level of β-catenin was not caused by a general increase in β-catenin expression. In line with this, TCF/LEF reporter assays using the TOPflash/FOPflash reporters in human breast epithelial cells indicated that Wnt-5a signaling did not induce canonical β-catenin signaling (supplemental materials Fig. S1A and Ref. 16Dejmek J. Safholm A. Kamp Nielsen C. Andersson T. Leandersson K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 6024-6036Google Scholar). Wnt-5a Induces an Increased β-Catenin/E-Cadherin Complex Formation—To investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for the Wnt-5a-induced membrane association of β-catenin, we performed co-immunoprecipitations of β-catenin and E-cadherin. We found an increased association of E-cadherin to β-catenin both in HB2 Wnt-5ahigh cells and in HB2 Wnt-5alow cells treated with rWnt-5a for 2.5 h (Fig. 3, A and B, left panel). The Wnt-5a-induced association occurred already after 1 h of treatment with rWnt-5a (Fig. 3A). This was also seen in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 either treated with rWnt-5a for 2.5 h, or constitutively overexpressing Wnt-5a (MCF-7 Wnt-5ahigh; Fig. 3B, right panel). Wnt-5a Does Not Affect Tyrosine Phosphorylation of β-Catenin—β-Catenin can be tyrosine phosphorylated at two residues, Tyr(P)-142 and Tyr(P)-691. Previous studies suggest that one of the phosphorylated tyrosines leads to dissociation from α-catenin, whereas the other leads to dissociation from the E-cadherin complex (27Brembeck F.H. Rosario M. Birchmeier W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 2006; 16: 51-59Google Scholar). To explore whether Wnt-5a signaling can affect the association of β-catenin to E-cadherin by affecting the tyrosine phosphorylations of β-catenin, we performed immunoprecipitation studies of total β-catenin from HB2 Wnt-5alow and Wnt-5alow cells treated with rWnt-5a (Fig. 3C). However, we did not see a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin. The experiment was also performed comparing HB2 Wnt-5alow and HB2 Wnt-5ahigh cells with the same result (data not shown). Wnt-5a-induced Serine Phosphorylation of β-Catenin Leads to an Increased E-Cadherin Complex Formation—It has been suggested that phosphorylation of specific Ser/Thr residues on β-catenin can increase the binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin (7Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science.. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Google Scholar, 8Daugherty R.L. Gottardi C.J. Physiol. (Bethesda).. 2007; 22: 303-309Google Scholar). To investigate whether β-catenin is serine/threonine phosphorylated upon Wnt-5a treatment we performed new immunoprecipitations of β-catenin and analyzed the phosphoserine/threonine levels (Fig. 3D). We could detect an increased phosphorylation of serine/threonine both in HB2 Wnt-5ahigh cells and Wnt-5alow cells treated with rWnt-5a. The serine/threonine kinase CKI has previously been shown to phosphorylate β-catenin-Ser-45 in the absence of canonical Wnt signaling (28Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell.. 2002; 108: 837-847Google Scholar), but also to phosphorylate E-cadherin on Ser-846, hence leading to a decreased association to β-catenin (11Dupre-Crochet S. Figueroa A. Hogan C. Ferber E.C. Bialucha C.U. Adams J. Richardson E.C. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 3804-3816Google Scholar). However, there are conflicting data as to whether CKI activity actually is negative for the β-catenin/E-cadherin interaction (11Dupre-Crochet S. Figueroa A. Hogan C. Ferber E.C. Bialucha C.U. Adams J. Richardson E.C. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 3804-3816Google Scholar, 12Catimel B. Layton M. Church N. Ross J. Condron M. Faux M. Simpson R.J. Burgess A.W. Nice E.C. Anal. Biochem... 2006; 357: 277-288Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Wnt-5a activates CKIα in human breast epithelial cells (16Dejmek J. Safholm A. Kamp Nielsen C. Andersson T. Leandersson K. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 6024-6036Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon addition of the selective CKIα/ϵ inhibitor (IC261), we saw a small reduction in phosphoserine/threonine levels of β-catenin (Fig. 3D). More importantly, this only occurred in cells stimulated with Wnt-5a. The Wnt-5a-induced β-catenin/E-Cadherin complex formation was also inhibited upon addition of the CKI inhibitor (Fig. 4A). Again, this was Wnt-5a specific because the HB2 Wnt-5alow cells treated with the CKI inhibitor did not show a decreased complex formation (see below). The complex formation was inhibited after a 1-h treatment with CKI inhibitor and had virtually disappeared after 2.5 h. Interestingly, and in line with a recent study mentioned above (11Dupre-Crochet S. Figueroa A. Hogan C. Ferber E.C. Bialucha C.U. Adams J. Richardson E.C. Fujita Y. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2007; 27: 3804-3816Google Scholar), treatment"
https://openalex.org/W2116894238,"Since the 1980s, sex ratio at birth (male births per 100 female births) has increased in many Asian countries as a result of selective abortions, but to date there has been no such evidence for Viet Nam. Our aim in this paper is to ascertain the situation with respect to sex ratio at birth in Viet Nam over the past five years.Original data were obtained from sample population surveys in Viet Nam recording annual birth rates since 2000 of about 450,000 women, as well as from two successive birth surveys conducted for the first time in 2007 (1.1 million births). The annual population surveys include specific information on birth history and mothers' characteristics to be used for the analysis of trends and differentials in sex ratio at birth.Birth history statistics indicate that the SRB in Viet Nam has recorded a steady growth since 2001. Starting from a level probably close to the biological standard of 105, the SRB reached 108 in 2005 and 112 in 2006, a value significantly above the normal level. An independent confirmation of these results comes from the surveys of births in health facilities which yielded a SRB of 110 in 2006-07. High SRB is linked to various factors such as access to modern health care, number of prenatal visits, level of higher education and employment status, young age, province of residence and prenatal sex determination. These results suggest that prenatal sex determination followed by selective abortion has recently become more common in Viet Nam. This recent trend is a consequence of various factors such as preference for sons, declining fertility, easy access to abortion, economic development as well as the increased availability of ultrasonography facilities."

It is enriched in transcriptionally active regions of chromatin and is implicated in epigenetic memory. The dynamics of H3.3 deposition during transcriptional activation, however, have not been fully studied so far. Here we examined H3.3 incorporation into interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes in confluent mouse NIH3T3 cells expressing H3.3 fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Following IFN stimulation, H3.3-YFP was rapidly incorporated into all four IFN-activated genes tested, with the highest enrichment seen in the distal end of the coding region. Surprisingly, H3.3 enrichment in the coding region continued for an extended period of time, long after transcription ceased. The promoter region, although constitutively enriched with H3.3-YFP, did not show an increase in its deposition in response to IFN stimulation. Further, although H3.3-YFP deposition stably remained in non-dividing cells for days after IFN stimulation, it was rapidly diminished in dividing cells. Lastly, we examined the role of H3.3 in IFN-stimulated transcription by a short hairpin RNA approach and found that IFN-stimulated transcription was significantly impaired in H3.3 knockdown cells.

Recent studies of the histone H3.3 variant indicate that it is incorporated into nucleosomal chromatin in association with active gene expression (1Henikoff S. Ahmad K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Although other H3 variants, H3.1 and H3.2, are synthesized predominantly in S phase and are deposited onto newly replicated DNA, H3.3 is synthesized throughout the cell cycle, independent of DNA replication. Replication-independent incorporation of H3.3 is mediated by the HIRA complex, through a mechanism distinct from that of replication-dependent deposition of H3.1 mediated by the CAF1 complex (5Tagami H. Ray-Gallet D. Almouzni G. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2004; 116: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). In Drosophila as well as in mammalian cells, H3.3 is enriched in nucleosomes carrying post-translational modification patterns characteristic of active transcription (6McKittrick E. Gafken P.R.

Cell. 2006; 24: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). On the other hand, H3K9 dimethylation, typically seen in transcriptionally repressed chromatin, is scarce in H3.3. Histone H3.3 is accumulated in the transcriptionally active ribosomal DNA array in the Drosophila nucleus (8Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). A genome-wide analysis of H3.3 distribution patterns showed that H3.3 is distributed predominantly over regions of active genes and is enriched in the promoter regions coinciding with methylated Lys-4 in H3 and abundant RNA polymerase II binding (9Mito Y. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1090-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These studies led to a proposition that H3.3 marks active chromatin and may be involved in the epigenetic maintenance of chromatin status (3Hake S.B. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence supporting the role of H3.3 in the inheritance of activated gene status was recently presented by nuclear transplantation experiments in Xenopus (13Ng R.K. Gurdon J.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been shown that H3.3 replacement is triggered upon transcriptional activation of the HSP 70 genes in Drosophila (14Schwartz B.E. Ahmad K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In that study, H3.3 deposition began within minutes of heat shock stimulation. This induced deposition coinciding with chromosomal puffs, providing an immediate link between transcription and H3.3 enrichment. Further supporting transcription-coupled H3.3 deposition, Janicki et al. (15Janicki S.M. Tsukamoto T. Salghetti S.E. Tansey W.P. Sachidanandam R. Prasanth K.V. Ried T. Shav-Tal Y. Bertrand E.

Despite these studies, there are questions that have remained uncertain regarding H3.3 incorporation. For example, it is unclear whether transcriptional activation is a prerequisite of H3.3 deposition. Also unclear is the stability of transcription-induced H3.3 deposition as well as the spatial patterns of H3.3 incorporation within induced genes. In addition, the biological significance of transcription-coupled H3.3 enrichment has remained elusive. With respect to the sites of H3.3 enrichment within a gene, widely varied results are reported for vertebrate cells, ranging from promoter-biased H3.3 incorporation to broader distribution patterns that include coding regions (16Chow C.M.

In this report, we have studied interferon (IFN)-dependent transcription as a model to address signal-induced H3.3 replacement. A special attention has been placed on detailed time course and sites of H3.3 deposition within a transcribed gene.

Many of these genes begin transcription immediately after IFN stimulation, without requiring new protein synthesis, followed by rapid cessation of transcription afterward (21Borden E.C. Sen G.C.

To minimize the effect of replication-dependent H3.1/H3.2 deposition, H3.3 incorporation was tested in near confluent cells. We found that IFN stimulation triggered extensive and prolonged H3.3 enrichment in the coding regions of multiple IFN-response genes. In addition, IFN-induced transcription was substantially reduced when H3.3 expression is knocked down by stable H3.3 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), suggesting that induced H3.3 deposition was functionally linked to IFN-stimulated transcription. Cells—NIH3T3 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, penicillin, and streptomycin (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) with 10% donor bovine serum (Atlantic Biologicals). Semiconfluent NIH3T3 cells were treated with mouse recombinant IFNβ (PBL Interferon Source) at 100 units/ml for the indicated periods. HeLa (ATCC) cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Retroviral Vectors and Transduction—Retroviral vectors expressing H3.1 or H3.3 fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), MSCV-H3.1-YFP and MSCV-H3.3-YFP, were constructed from cDNAs from pOZ-e-H3.1 (a gift from Y.

The template for the shRNA targeting both H3f3a and H3f3b was obtained by annealing nucleotides (5′-GATCCCCTGAAGATACCAATCTGTGTTTCAAGAGAACACAGATTGGTATCTTCATTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAATGAAGATACCAATCTGTGTTCTCTTGAAACACAGATTGGTATCTTCAGGG-3′) and was ligated into BglII/HindIII sites of pSuper.retro (Oligoengine) to generate the shRNA expressing retroviral vector to knockdown H3.3 genes. A control pSuper.retro carrying unrelated shRNA sequence is described previously (24Mochizuki K. Nishiyama A. Jang M.K. Dey A. Ghosh A. Tamura T. Natsume H. Yao H. Ozato K. J. Biol.

Retroviral supernatants were collected at 48 h. NIH3T3, HeLa, and Tot2 cells were transduced with retroviruses by spinoculation (2,500 rpm) at 30 °C for 1.5 h in medium containing 3% (for transducing H3-YFP into NIH3T3 cells) or 25% (for transducing H3-YFP into HeLa and Tot2 cells or transducing shRNA) viral supernatant and 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Transduced cells were selected by immunomagnetic cell sorting using MACS CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) or by puromycin (4 μg/ml). For confocal microscopy, nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342, and the cells were viewed on a TCS SP2 (Leica). Antibodies and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), anti-H3K36me3 (ab9050; AbCam), anti-RNAPII-2P (MMS-129R; Covance Research Products), anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), anti-H3K4me3 (ab8580; AbCam), anti-H3K9me3 (07-442; Upstate Biotechnology), anti-H3ac (06-599; Upstate Biotechnology), normal rabbit IgG (Sigma), normal rabbit serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), and normal mouse IgM (Sigma). A ChIP assay was performed as described previously (23Tamura T. Thotakura P. Tanaka T.S. Ko M.S. Ozato K. Blood. 2005; 106: 1938-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, cells on a 15-cm plate were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, cells were lysed in 1 ml of the SDS lysis buffer and then sonicated in an XL2007 sonicator on wet ice for 25 s eight times using 15% of maximum power to shear the genomic DNA into 200–1000-bp fragments. After centrifugation, 100 μl of supernatants were diluted with 900 μl of the ChIP dilution buffer (23Tamura T. Thotakura P. Tanaka T.S. Ko M.S. Ozato K. Blood. 2005; 106: 1938-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chromatin was precleared with 80 μl of protein A/G agarose-25% slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) supplemented with salmon sperm DNA (200 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared chromatin was incubated with an appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C with rotation. For precipitation with monoclonal mouse antibody, anti-mouse IgM antibody was added during the last 1 h of incubation. Then 60 μl of protein A/G-25% slurry with salmon sperm DNA were added, and samples were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C to collect immune precipitates. Precipitates were then washed twice with each of the following buffers in order: low salt wash buffer, high salt wash buffer, LiCl wash buffer, and TE buffer (23Tamura T. Thotakura P. Tanaka T.S. Ko M.S. Ozato K. Blood. 2005; 106: 1938-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). After elution of the chromatin complexes, the cross-link was reversed, and RNA and proteins were digested with RNase and proteinase K, respectively. DNA was then recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris, pH 8. Five μl of each sample were used for quantification of the specific region of genomic DNA (40–100 bp) by duplicate real-time PCR amplifications. Input DNA (1%) was used for normalization. Reverse Transcription and Quantitative PCR—Reverse transcription (RT) was performed as described previously (23Tamura T. Thotakura P. Tanaka T.S. Ko M.S. Ozato K. Blood. 2005; 106: 1938-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) except that an oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the SYBR Green PCR master kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Transcript levels were normalized by Gapdh mRNA and expressed as relative to those in unstimulated cells. Primer sequences used for qPCR are available upon request. Immunoblot Analysis—For preparation of acid extracts, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science), and then hydrochloric acid was added to a final concentration of 0.2 n. After incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation, lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were dialyzed against 0.1 n acetic acid for 1 h and against H2O three times for 1 h, 3 h, and overnight, respectively. Fifteen μg of extracts were separated on NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Immobilon-P (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was hybridized with specific antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The signal was visualized by the SuperSignal West Pico kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's protocols. IFN Treatment Triggers H3.3-YFP Incorporation into IFN-stimulated Genes, Preferentially in the Distal Coding Region—To study H3.3 deposition patterns following IFN-induced transcription, we first constructed NIH3T3 cells stably expressing H3.3-YFP or H3.1-YFP through retroviral transduction. GFP/YFP-tagged histone H3.3 has been used to study H3.3 replacement in Drosophila and human cells (8Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Mol.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Levels of H3.3-YFP and H3.1-YFP expressed in NIH3T3 cells were similar and less than 5% of total histone H3 (supplemental Fig. S1 and see Fig. 4). To validate the use of H3-YFP constructs in assessing behavior of H3, we checked their localization during mitosis. H3.3-YFP localized to condensed mitotic chromosomes, as did H3.1-YFP (supplemental Fig. S2A). Further supporting proper association of H3.3-YFP with chromatin, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching showed that both H3.1-YFP and H3.3-YFP recovered very slowly after photobleaching as reported (26Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 105-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), indicating that they are part of cellular chromatin (supplemental Fig. S2B). As shown in Fig. 1A, confocal microscopy analysis revealed a clear difference in the distribution patterns of H3.1-YFP and H3.3-YFP. Although H3.1-YFP was enriched at heterochromatic regions with intense DNA stain, H3.3-YFP was largely absent in the heterochromatic regions, showing a broad distribution pattern in the nucleus, indicative of a euchromatin-dominant localization pattern (Fig. 1A). A similar euchromatin-prevalent distribution of H3.3 was reported for Drosophila cells (14Schwartz B.E. Ahmad K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 804-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To study the dynamics of H3.3 incorporation, NIH3T3 cells were rendered near confluent, treated with IFNβ, and subjected to ChIP assay. Near confluent cells were tested because we wished to minimize replication-dependent H3 deposition. We first tested the Ifit1 gene, a representative of IFN-inducible genes (27Guo J. Hui D.J. Merrick W.C. Sen G.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Sen G.C. Sarkar S.N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2007; 316: 233-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As expected, Ifit1 mRNA expression rose within 1 h after IFN treatment and reached 1000-fold higher levels at 3 h irrespective of the expression of H3.3-YFP or H.3.1-YFP, comparable with the induction in parental NIH3T3 cells. Ifit1 transcript levels rapidly declined thereafter and returned almost to the basal level by 12 h in these cells (Fig. 1C). Cells transduced with H3.3-YFP responded to IFNβ to express transcripts for Ifit1 and other IFN-inducible genes in a manner very similar to that of parental NIH3T3 cells, confirming that IFN responsiveness is not appreciably altered by exogenous H3.3-YFP expression under these conditions (supplemental Fig. S3). ChIP assays were performed over three distinct region of the 8.75-kb-long Ifit1 gene, i.e. the promoter region (-120), the proximal and distal sites of the coding regions (+2.9 and +7 kb, respectively, see a map in Fig. 1B). Results of ChIP assays performed using anti-GFP antibody are shown in Fig. 1D. IFN treatment rapidly induced H3.3-YFP enrichment, most noticeably over the distal site of the coding region (red line, +7k). Detailed time course analysis showed that increased H3.3-YFP incorporation took place immediately after IFN treatment and continued for the initial 12 h followed by a slower rise continuing up to 24 h (see the early time course in Fig. 1D, right panel). Although modest, H3.3-YFP was also enriched over the proximal coding region (blue, +2.9k) after IFN treatment. However, H3.3-YFP incorporation did not increase over the promoter region; rather it seemed slightly reduced after IFN treatment (Fig. 1D, green). Similarly, H3.3-YFP deposition in an upstream promoter region (-1.5 kb) was low and did not change after IFN treatment (data not shown). In contrast to the dramatic rise in H3.3-YFP deposition, the amount of H3.1-YFP incorporation remained similar before and after IFN treatment over both the upstream promoter and the coding regions. We noted that H3.1-YFP incorporation, like that of H3.3-YFP, showed a 2-fold reduction in the promoter region after IFN treatment. The reduction of both H3.3-YFP and H3.1-YFP following IFN stimulation likely reflects transcription-induced nucleosome depletion as is known for many genes both in human and in yeast (29Lee C.K. Shibata Y. Rao B. Strahl B.D. Lieb J.D. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 30Bernstein B.E. Kamal M. Lindblad-Toh K. Bekiranov S. Bailey D.K. Huebert D.J.

To further substantiate increased H3.3 deposition at the distal coding region, we calculated the ratio of incorporated H3.3-YFP to that of H3.1-YFP over these regions and found that IFN treatment enriched H3.3-YFP over the coding regions but not at the promoter region (Fig. 1B, lower right panel). It is of note here that prior to IFN treatment, H3.3-YFP was, although modest, enriched at the promoter region relative to H3.1 (2:1), in line with reports indicating that some constitutively expressed and poised genes show H3.3 enrichment in the promoter regions (9Mito Y. Henikoff J.G. Henikoff S. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1090-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 16Chow C.M. Georgiou A. Szutorisz H. Maia e Silva A. Pombo A. Barahona I. Dargelos E. Canzonetta C. Dillon N. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Induced H3.3 deposition at the 3′-coding region after IFN treatment was confirmed when H3.3-YFP data were normalized with total H3 (supplemental Fig. S4). In these experiments, the amount of DNA precipitated with control Ig was consistently less than 0.01% of total input and did not change after IFN treatment (not shown). These data indicate that IFN treatment triggers H3.3 deposition in the Ifit1 gene and deposition continues long after completion of transcription, showing a striking preference for the 3′-coding region. To assess whether this unexpected pattern of H3.3-YFP enrichment is a general feature for IFN-stimulated genes, ChIP assays were performed for three additional IFN-inducible genes, Oas1, Stat1, and Mx1, in the above NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2, A–C) The length of the coding regions for these genes ranged from 11.2 to 41.5 kb. As expected, the transcripts for these genes were robustly induced following IFN treatment, showing similar kinetics as those of Ifit1 induction (see Fig. 6). A remarkably similar pattern of H3.3-YFP enrichment was observed with these genes (Fig. 2, A–C). In all genes, H3.3-YFP was enriched after IFN treatment, most heavily at the 3′-distal sites of the coding regions. Mirroring the long lasting deposition kinetics seen for the Ifit1 gene, H3.3-YFP accumulation continued in these genes for 24 h followed by a plateau that lasted for an additional 24 h.FIGURE 6Inhibition of IFN-stimulated gene expression in H3.3 knockdown (KD) cells. A, NIH3T3 cells were transduced with a vector for H3.3 shRNA or control (Ctrl) shRNA for 4 days, and levels of H3f3a,b (H3.3) or Hist1h3a (H3.1) transcripts were quantified by qRT-PCR. Values represent the average of three determinations ± S.D. B, the above cells were treated with IFNβ for 24 h, and the levels of indicated IFN-responsive transcripts were measured at the indicated times by qRT-PCR. C, levels of Tbp and Gtf2b transcripts are measured in the above cells. Note that the y axis is enlarged to emphasize the slight reduction in transcript expression in H3.3 knockdown cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was important to ascertain whether H3.3-YFP enrichment seen after IFN treatment occurred only in IFN-stimulated genes. To this end, ChIP analysis was performed for constitutively expressed genes not activated by IFN, namely the Gtf2b (encoding TFIIB) and Tbp gene (encoding TATA-binding protein) (Fig. 2, D and E). In both cases, IFN treatment hardly affected H3.3-YFP deposition. Interestingly, however, the distal sites of the coding region showed the highest constitutive enrichment relative to the promoter and proximal coding regions in these genes. In addition to NIH3T3 cells, 3′-biased H3.3-YFP deposition was observed for the Gtf2b and Tbp genes in a hematopoietic cell line, Tot2 (not shown). These data suggest that the coding region-biased H3.3 enrichment may be a widespread feature of actively transcribed genes. Recruitment of the Elongation Form of RNA Polymerase II and Trimethylation of H3K36 Correlate with Increased H3.3-YFP Deposition in the Coding Region—To gain insight into the coding region-biased, continuous H3.3-YFP deposition after IFN stimulation, we performed ChIP analysis over the Ifit1 gene for total RNA polymerase II (pol II) and pol II phosphorylated at serine 2 in the C-terminal domain, the elongation form of pol II (Fig. 3A, Pol II-2P) (31Sims III, R.J. Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2437-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). pol II was not found on the Ifit1 gene prior to simulation but was rapidly recruited to the promoter region following IFN addition as noted for other IFN-inducible genes (32Sakamoto S. Potla R. Larner A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pol II recruitment peaked at 3 and 6 h and declined thereafter, although it did not return to the basal level at least for 48 h. The phosphorylated, elongation form of pol II (pol II-2P) showed similar recruitment kinetics. Interestingly, however, the highest recruitment was seen at the 3′ region of the gene, suggesting that serine-2 phosphorylation in the pol II C-terminal domain increased as pol II moved through the gene during transcript elongation. pol II-2P recruitment returned to the basal level by 10 h, correlating with the kinetics of Ifit1 mRNA induction. It has been shown that the promoter regions of actively transcribed genes are enriched with trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylation of H3 lysine 9 and 14 (H3ac) (30Bernstein B.E.

In agreement, we found that IFN treatment increased H3K4me3 modification and H3 diacetylation, mostly in the proximal site of the coding region, which remained for 48 h (Fig. 3B). These marks were, however, not increased in the 3′-coding region of the gene. Methylation of H3K9, although generally associated with repressed chromatin, has recently been shown to occur transiently in the transcribed region of activated genes, an event requiring transcriptional elongation (35Vakoc C.R.

FBI-1 (formerly called Pokemon) is a member of the POK family of transcriptional repressors. Recently, FBI-1 was characterized as a critical oncogenic factor that specifically represses transcription of the tumor suppressor gene ARF, potentially leading indirectly to p53 inactivation. Our investigations on transcriptional repression of the p53 pathway revealed that FBI-1 represses transcription of ARF, Hdm2 (human analogue of mouse double minute oncogene), and p21CIP1 (hereafter indicated as p21) but not of p53. FBI-1 showed a more potent repressive effect on p21 than on p53. Our data suggested that FBI-1 is a master controller of the ARF-Hdm2-p53-p21 pathway, ultimately impinging on cell cycle arrest factor p21, by inhibiting upstream regulators at the transcriptional and protein levels. FBI-1 acted as a competitive transcriptional repressor of p53 and Sp1 and was shown to bind the proximal Sp1–3 GC-box and the distal p53-responsive elements of p21. Repression involved direct binding competition of FBI-1 with Sp1 and p53. FBI-1 also interacted with corepressors, such as mSin3A, NCoR, and SMRT, thereby deacetylating Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 histones at the promoter. FBI-1 caused cellular transformation, promoted cell cycle proliferation, and significantly increased the number of cells in S phase. FBI-1 is aberrantly overexpressed in many human solid tumors, particularly in adenocarcinomas and squamous carcinomas. The role of FBI-1 as a master controller of the p53 pathway therefore makes it an attractive therapeutic target.

Whereas induction of p21 leads predominantly to cell cycle arrest, repression of p21 gene expression may have a variety of outcomes, including cell proliferation, depending on the cell context (Refs. 32el-Deiry W.S.

In addition to p53, a variety of other factors, including Sp1/Sp3, Smads, AP2, STAT, BRCA1, E2F-1/E2F-3, and C/EBPα and -β, activate the transcription of p21 gene (34Gartel A.L. Radhakrishnan S.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 3980-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Other major regulators that affect p21 gene expression are the Sp1 family transcription factors, which bind to the proximal promoter (38Koutsodontis G. Tentes I. Papakosta P. Moustakas A.

The Sp1–3 GC-box bound by Sp1 has been shown to be particularly important; mutation of the site nearly eliminates transcription, and it also disrupts the synergistic transcriptional activation by Sp1 and p53 (38Koutsodontis G.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8575-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). FBI-1 was recently shown to repress the tumor suppressor gene ARF, which in turn lowers expression of the tumor suppressor gene p53. FBI-1 overexpression causes oncogenesis in the thymus, liver, and spleen (8Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I. Zelent A. Cordon-Cardo C. Teruya-Feldstein J. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2005; 433: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Because FBI-1 is also overexpressed in solid tumors, such as cancers of the colon and bladder, where the normal functions of ARF and p53 are lost (8Maeda T. Hobbs R.M. Merghoub T. Guernah I.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8575-8578Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is likely that FBI-1 has additional target genes through which it exerts its oncogenic activity. In this study, we investigated whether the ARF-Hdm2-p53-p21 pathway (referred to as the p53 pathway) (45Toledo F. Wahl G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 909-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), an important element in cell cycle control and oncogenesis, is controlled by FBI-1; in particular, we focused on the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 gene. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism and physiological consequence of FBI-1 action. Our data suggest that FBI-1 is a master regulator of the p53 pathway and plays a critical role in regulating important biological processes controlled by p21 and other members of the p53 pathway, such as oncogenic cellular transformation, cell growth, and proliferation. Plasmids, Antibodies, and Reagents—pGL2-p21-Luc, pGL2-p21-Luc WT –131 bp, and pGL2-p21-Luc WT –101 bp were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshihiro Sowa (Kyoto Perpetual University of Medicine, Japan).

Sp1ZFDBD (amino acids 622–778) and FBI-1ZFDBD (amino acids 382–490) were prepared by cloning PCR-amplified cDNA fragments into pGEX4T1. To prepare GST-POZFBI-1, a cDNA fragment encoding the POZ domain of FBI-1 was cloned into pGEX4T3. The lentiviruses M1.4-FBI-1-FLAG, -GFP, or -LacZ were obtained from Vectorcorea (Korea). The sequences of all the constructs used in this study were verified. Various pGL2 promoter-Luc and expression vectors for p53 and FBI-1 were prepared by standard cloning procedures. Various purified recombinant proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pGEX4T1 protein expression vectors (Amersham Biosciences). Primary and secondary antibodies were obtained from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), Chemicon (Temecula, CA), Calbiochem, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), Dako, Vector Laboratories, and Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen) were used for transfection. Buffer recipes, PCR amplification procedures, siRNA sequences, and primer sequences are available upon request. Unless otherwise noted, all other chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell lines, lacking endogenous p53, were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Saos-2 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. All other cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). HeLa cells cultured with Polybrene (8 μg/ml) were incubated (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 6–8 h with 350 μl of 4 × 107 transducing units/ml LentiM1.4-FLAG-FBI-1 (experimental) or LentiM1.4eGFP and LentiM1.4LacZ (control). NIH/3T3 cells were infected with His- and Myc-tagged LentiM1.4-FBI-1 (experimental) or LentiM1.4 (control). Puromycin was used to select stable cells after 2–3 days. Doxycycline (1 μg/ml)-inducible FBI-1-overexpressing cells were prepared by transfecting mammalian Flp-In T-REx host HEK293T cells (Invitrogen) with pOG44:pcDNA5/FRT/TO-FBI-1 plasmid DNA (9:1). Stable FBI-1-overexpressing cells were selected with hygromycin (300 μg/ml) and blasticidin (15 μg/ml). Transcriptional Analysis—pGL2-Hdm2-Luc, pGL2-ARF-Luc, and pGL2-p53-Luc were prepared by cloning the promoter fragments into pGL2-Luc Basic (Promega, WI). WT or mutant p21-Luc reporter plasmids, pcDNA3-FBI-1, pcDNA3.1-p53, and pCMV-LacZ were transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Luciferase activity, measured at 36 h, was normalized by cotransfected β-galactosidase activity or protein concentration. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—A ChIP assay (Upstate) was used to investigate whether FBI-1 and FRE interact in vivo. Subconfluent HeLa cells and Saos-2 cells were transfected for 48 h with 1 μg of pGL2-p21-Luc and 3 μg of either pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-FBI-1-FLAG. HeLa cells and Drosophila SL2 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, washed, lysed with SDS lysis buffer, and sonicated into DNA fragments of 500–1000 bp.

Application of norepinephrine-generated hyperpolarization and decreased the excitability of the neurons in the superficial layers with no effects on neuronal excitability in the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. Norepinephrine-induced hyperpolarization was mediated by α2A adrenergic receptors and required the functions of Gαi proteins, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A. Norepinephrine-mediated depression on neuronal excitability was mediated by activation of TREK-2, a type of two-pore domain K+ channel, and mutation of the protein kinase A phosphorylation site on TREK-2 channels annulled the effects of norepinephrine.

The physiological and pathological roles of the EC are likely to be determined by its unique position in the brain; the EC serves as the interface to control the flow of information into and out of the hippocampus. Afferents from the olfactory structures, parasubiculum, perirhinal cortex, claustrum, amygdala, and neurons in the deep layers of the EC (layers V-VI) (10Witter M.P. Groenewegen H.J.

Synapse.. 1993; 13: 206-214Google Scholar) adrenergic receptors (ARs), although the identities of cells expressing these ARs in the EC remain to be determined. Accordingly, application of norepinephrine (NE) in the EC has been shown to inhibit glutamatergic transmission via activation of α2 ARs (27Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1995; 7: 2370-2378Google Scholar, 28Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Neurosci. Lett... 1994; 179: 145-148Google Scholar) and facilitate GABAergic transmission via activation of α1 ARs (29Lei S. Deng P.Y. Porter J.E. Shin H.S. J. Neurophysiol... 2007; 98: 2868-2877Google Scholar). The concerted effects of NE on glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission would result in powerful inhibition in the EC likely contributing to its antiepileptic actions observed in this brain region (22Stanton P.K. Jones R.S. Mody I. Heinemann U. Epilepsy Res... 1987; 1: 53-62Google Scholar, 30Stoop R. Epiney S. Meier E. Pralong E. Neurosci. Lett... 2000; 287: 5-8Google Scholar). Whereas application of NE has been shown to generate membrane hyperpolarization in a proportion (∼54%) of principal neurons in layer II of the EC (28Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Neurosci. Lett... 1994; 179: 145-148Google Scholar) via α2 AR-mediated activation of K+ channels (27Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1995; 7: 2370-2378Google Scholar), which may partially explain its inhibitory effects on glutamatergic transmission, the following questions still remain unaddressed. First, what subtype(s) of α2 ARs is/are involved in NE-mediated hyperpolarization in the EC, because members of the α2 AR family include the α2A, α2B, and α2C subtypes (31Hein L. Cell Tissue Res... 2006; 326: 541-551Google Scholar)? Second, does NE have any effects on the excitability of neurons in other layers of the EC, because the superficial layers are the sender and the deep layers are the recipient of hippocampal information? Third, which type(s) of K+ channels is/are involved in NE-mediated hyperpolarization? Finally, what are the signaling mechanisms underlying NE-induced hyperpolarization in the EC? In the present study, we address these questions, and our results demonstrate that NE generates membrane hyperpolarization in the superficial layers, especially layer III, with no effects on neuronal excitability in the deep layers (V/VI) of the EC. NE activates TREK-2, a two-pore domain K+ channel, via α2A AR-mediated inhibition of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Our results provide a novel cellular and molecular mechanism that may at least partially explain the antiepileptic effects of NE in the EC as well as its roles in learning and memory. Slice Preparation—Horizontal brain slices (400 μm), including the EC, subiculum, and hippocampus, were cut using a vibrating blade microtome (VT1000S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) from 13- to 20-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (29Lei S. Deng P.Y. Porter J.E. Shin H.S. J. Neurophysiol... 2007; 98: 2868-2877Google Scholar, 32Deng P.Y. Porter J.E. Shin H.S. Lei S. J. Physiol... 2006; 57.7: 497-511Google Scholar, 33Deng P.Y. Lei S. J.

Pharmacol... 2007; 72: 208-218Google Scholar). After being deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, rats were decapitated and their brains were dissected out in ice-cold saline solution that contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 24 NaHCO3, 3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 5.0 MgCl2, and 10 glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Slices were initially incubated in the above solution at 35 °C for 40 min for recovery and then kept at room temperature (∼24 °C) until use. All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines approved by the University of North Dakota Animal Care and Use Committee. Whole Cell Recordings from the EC Neurons—Whole cell patch clamp recordings using an Axopatch 200B or two Multi-clamp 700B amplifiers (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in current- or voltage-clamp mode were made usually from pyramidal neurons in layer III of the medial EC visually identified with infrared videomicroscopy (Olympus BX51WI) and differential interference contrast optics. Unless stated otherwise, recording electrodes were filled with (in mm) 130 K+-gluconate, 0.5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 5 NaCl, 2 ATP2Na, 0.4 GTP-Na, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The extracellular solution comprised (in mm) 130 NaCl, 24 NaHCO3, 3.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, and 10 glucose, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4. Because NE has been shown to increase GABA release (29Lei S. Deng P.Y. Porter J.E. Shin H.S. J. Neurophysiol... 2007; 98: 2868-2877Google Scholar) and inhibit glutamatergic transmission (27Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1995; 7: 2370-2378Google Scholar, 28Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Neurosci. Lett... 1994; 179: 145-148Google Scholar) in the EC, the preceding extracellular solution was routinely supplemented with bicuculline (10 μm) and CGP55845 (1 μm) to block GABAA and GABAB responses, respectively, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (10 μm) and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 μm) to block glutamatergic transmission. Under these conditions, the excitability of pyramidal neurons in layer III was not affected by the indirect effects of NE on GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission. Data were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP 9 software (Molecular Devices). Action potential firing was recorded from pyramidal neurons in layer III of the EC. Because dialysis of K+-containing internal solution into cells can change the resting membrane potential and influence action potential firing, we waited for ∼10 min after the formation of whole cell recordings to allow the resting membrane potential to stabilize. Usually, for most of the cells a positive current injection was needed to bring the resting membrane potential to ∼-50 mV to induce action potential firing. NE was applied after the action potential firing had been stable for 5-10 min. To avoid potential desensitization induced by repeated applications of NE, one slice was limited to only one application of NE. Frequency of action potentials was calculated by Mini Analysis 6.0.1 (Synaptosoft Inc., Decatur, GA). Holding currents at -55 mV were recorded from layer III pyramidal neurons as well as the neurons in layer V/VI in some experiments. The preceding extracellular solution was supplemented with tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) to block action potential firing. Because gradual dialysis of K+ into cells changed the holding currents, we began our recordings after waiting for ∼10 min from the formation of whole cell configuration unless stated otherwise. Holding currents at -55 mV were recorded every 3 s and then averaged per minute. We subtracted the average of the holding currents recorded for the last minute prior to the application of NE from those recorded at different time points to zero the basal level of holding currents for better comparison. The voltage-current relationship was obtained by using a ramp protocol from -140 mV to -70 mV at a speed of 0.1 mV/ms. We compared the voltage-current curves recorded before and during the application of NE for ∼3-4 min when the effect of NE was maximal. Expression of α2A ARs and K2P Channels in HEK293 Cells and Electrophysiological Recordings from the Transfected Cells—A cDNA construct containing the human α2A AR subtype (GenBank™ accession number NM_000681) subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was purchased from Missouri University Science and Technology cDNA Resource Center. cDNA constructs coding for TREK-2 (NM_021161, subcloned into the pCMV6-XL4 vector), TREK-1 (NM_014217, subcloned into the pCMV6-entry vector), TWIK-1 (NM_002245, subcloned into pCMV6-XL5 vector), or TRESK (NM_181840, subcloned into pCMV6-XL5 vector) were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). cDNA constructs coding for TASK-1 (AF_031384) and TASK-3 (AF_391084) subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (35Deng P.Y. Poudel S.K. Rojanathammanee L. Porter J.E. Lei S. Mol. Pharmacol... 2007; 72: 208-218Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Douglas A. Bayliss (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). In addition, a previously characterized PKA-insensitive TREK-2 mutant (S359A) subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (36Kang D. Choe C. Cavanaugh E. Kim D. J. Physiol... 2007; 583: 57-69Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Dr. Donghee Kim (Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, Chicago, IL). An empty pEGFP N-3 green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein vector (GenBank™ accession number U57609) was purchased from Clontech. Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Atlanta, GA). Cell culture grade penicillin and streptomycin was purchased from Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Confluent HEK293 cells were washed in Hanks' balance salt solution, trypsinized, and seeded at the appropriate density in 35-mm dishes to ensure 40-50% cell confluence within 24 h. Transient transfection of the cDNA constructs was performed after 24 h with TransIT-293 transfection reagent according to the manufactures protocol (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) using a 6-μl reagent per 3-μg cDNA ratio for the transfection mixture. Transfected HEK293 cells were subsequently used for electrophysiological recordings 24-48 h post-transfection. Holding currents at -55 mV were recorded from the HEK293 cells that showed fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus 1X70) by whole cell recordings. The extracellular solution contained (in mm) 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose. pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH and HCl. The above K+-gluconate internal solution was used for this experiment. A continuous gravity perfusion system (flow, 5-7 ml/min) was used to change solutions. Immunocytochemistry—Rats (18 days old) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and then perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Brains were rapidly removed and postfixed in the same fixative for an additional 2 h. After postfixation, brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS for 12 h and then cut into 20-μm slices in thickness horizontally in a Leica cryostat (CM 3050 S) at -21 °C. Slices were washed in 0.1 m PBS and then treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After being rinsed in 0.1 m PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1.5% normal donkey serum for 30 min, slices were incubated with the primary antibodies (goat anti-α2A AR polyclonal antibody, sc-31357, or anti-TREK-2 polyclonal antibody, sc-11559, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:100 at 4 °C for 12 h. Slices were incubated at room temperature initially with biotinylated donkey anti-goat IgG (ABC Staining System, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, and then with avidin-biocytin complex (ABC Staining System) for 30 min. After each incubation, slices were washed three times for a total of 30 min. Diaminobenzidine (ABC Staining System) was used for a color reaction to detect the positive signals. Finally, slices were mounted on slides, dehydrated through an alcohol range, cleared in xylene, and covered with coverslips. Slides were visualized and photographed with a Leica microscope (DM 4000B). We stained 5-6 nonadjacent sections and each staining was repeated by using three rats. To confirm the specificities of α2A AR and TREK-2 antibodies, we also performed immunostaining of HEK293 cells transfected with GFP alone or GFP plus α2A ARs or GFP plus TREK-2 channels. The transfected cells on sterile glass coverslips were washed briefly with PBS and fixed in methanol at -10 °C for 5 min, then washed three times with PBS. Cells were incubated with normal donkey blocking serum (5%) containing 1% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated with goat anti-α2AAR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-31357) or anti-TREK-2 channel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11559) primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200 at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times in PBS, cells were incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG-rhodamine (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2094) at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips with the stained cells were mounted on slides, viewed, and photographed under an Olympus Fluoview 300 laser scanning confocal microscope. Each staining was repeated three times in three different transfections. Western Blot—Brain tissues for Western blot experiments were taken from seven rats (18 days old). For each rat, horizontal brain slices were cut initially, and the medial EC region was punched out from the slices under a microscope. The isolated brain region was lysed in tissue protein extraction buffer containing protease inhibitors (Pierce). The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove the insoluble materials and protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). An equivalent of 40 μg of total protein was loaded to each lane. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA) membranes using an electrophoretic transfer system (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 5% powdered milk, and then incubated with either TREK-2 (1:500) or α2AAR (1:500) primary antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with the secondary antibody (donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase, 1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween 20 was used to wash the blots three times (10 min each) after incubation with both primary and secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and detected by a Biospectrum Imagining System (UVP, Upland, CA). Data Analysis—Data are presented as the means ± S.E. An NE concentration-response curve was fit by using the Hill equation: I = Imax × {1/[1 + (EC50/[ligand])n]}, where Imax is the maximum response, EC50 is the concentration of ligand producing a half-maximal response, and n is the Hill coefficient. Student's paired or unpaired t test or analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis as appropriate; p values are reported throughout the text and significance was set as p < 0.05. The N number in the text represents the cells examined. Chemicals—(Rp)-cAMPS, tertiapin, CGP 55845, pertussis toxin, and guanosine-5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP-β-S) were from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Corynathine, propranolol, yohimbine, UK14,304, BRL44408, imiloxan, and MDL-12,330A were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Antibodies to α2A ARs (sc-31357), TWIK-1 (sc-11483), TASK-1 (sc-32067), TASK-3 (sc-11322), TRESK (sc-51240), TREK-1 (sc-11554), and TREK-2 (sc-11559) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Other chemicals were products of Sigma-Aldrich. NE Inhibits the Neuronal Excitability in the Superficial Layers with No Effects on the Deep Layers of the EC—The EC can be divided into six layers (layers I-VI, Fig. 1A) (38Mulders W.H. West M.J. Slomianka L. J. Comp. Neurol... 1997; 385: 83-94Google Scholar). Layer I is the molecular layer, which has a scarcity of cells, whereas layer IV is the cell-sparse, fiber-rich narrow layer that constitutes the lamina dissecans. Thus the EC is actually classified as the superficial layers (layers II-III) that provide innervations to the hippocampus and the deep layers (layers V-VI) that receive hippocampal outputs. We initially examined the effects of NE on neuronal excitability in the superficial layers. Because the effects of NE in layer II have been studied previously (27Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1995; 7: 2370-2378Google Scholar, 28Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Neurosci. Lett... 1994; 179: 145-148Google Scholar), we focused on layer III. Pyramidal neurons are the principal cells in layer III, and the axons of these neurons provide the primary inputs to CA1 regions (12Steward O. Scoville S.A. J. Comp. Neurol... 1976; 169: 347-370Google Scholar, 13Witter M.P. Naber P.A. van Haeften T. Machielsen W.C. Rombouts S.A. Barkhof F. Scheltens P. Lopes da Silva F.H. Hippocampus.. 2000; 10: 398-410Google Scholar). The importance of layer III pyramidal neurons is further highlighted by the observations that these neurons are selectively lost in epileptic animals (39Du F. Schwarcz R. Neurosci. Lett... 1992; 147: 185-188Google Scholar, 40Du F. Whetsell W.O. Jr., Abou-Khalil B. Blumenkopf B. Lothman E.W. Schwarcz R. Epilepsy Res... 1993; 16: 223-233Google Scholar). We examined the effects of NE on neuronal excitability by recording action potential firing from the pyramidal neurons in layer III in current-clamp mode. The resting membrane potentials of these neurons were -61.1 ± 1.3 mV (n = 12) immediately after the formation of whole cell configuration, and thus these neurons did not fire spontaneous action potentials. We therefore injected a positive current to bring the membrane potential to ∼-50 mV to induce action potential firing. To prevent potential influences of NE-induced changes in GABA (29Lei S. Deng P.Y. Porter J.E. Shin H.S. J. Neurophysiol... 2007; 98: 2868-2877Google Scholar) and glutamate (27Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1995; 7: 2370-2378Google Scholar, 28Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Neurosci. Lett... 1994; 179: 145-148Google Scholar) release on the excitability of layer III pyramidal neurons, we included in the extracellular solution 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (10 μm) and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 μm) to block glutamatergic, and bicuculline (10 μm) and CGP55845 (1 μm) to block GABAergic transmission. Under these conditions, application of NE (100 μm) significantly reduced the frequency of action potential firing (28 ± 5% of control, p < 0.001, Fig. 1, B and C) in 12 out of 12 pyramidal neurons examined suggesting that NE reduces the excitability of pyramidal neurons in layer III of the EC. The EC50 of NE to reduce pyramidal neuron excitability was calculated to be 23 μm (Fig. 1D). To test whether the inhibitory effect of NE on action potential firing frequency was mediated by NE-induced hyperpolarization, we recorded NE-induced changes in resting membrane potential in the presence of bicuculline (10 μm), CGP55845 (1 μm), 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (10 μm), dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 μm), and tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) to block potential indirect effects from synaptic transmission. A negative current (-50 pA for 500 ms) was injected every 5 s to assess the changes of input resistance induced by NE (Fig. 1E). Under these circumstances, application of NE (100 μm) generated membrane hyperpolarization (control: -61.6 ± 0.8 mV; NE: -64.5 ± 0.7 mV, n = 6, p = 0.002, Fig. 1, E and F) and reduced the input resistance (control: 280.4 ± 5.2 MΩ, NE: 188.1 ± 7.9 MΩ; n = 6, p < 0.001, Fig. 1E) suggesting that NE increases membrane conductance. We then used voltage-clamp mode and recorded the holding currents at -55 mV, a potential close to the resting membrane potential of these neurons. Under these conditions, application of NE (100 μm) generated an outward holding current (maximal effect at the third minute after the beginning of NE application, 20.4 ± 1.6 pA, n = 10, p < 0.001, Fig. 1G). Together, these results indicate that NE inhibits the excitability of layer III pyramidal neurons by generating membrane hyperpolarization in the EC. About 54% of the neurons in layer II of the EC are responsive to NE (27Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Eur. J. Neurosci... 1995; 7: 2370-2378Google Scholar, 28Pralong E. Magistretti P.J. Neurosci. Lett... 1994; 179: 145-148Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that every pyramidal neuron examined in layer III of the EC was responsive to NE. These results together indicate that NE inhibits the excitability of neurons in the superficial layers of the EC. However, the effects of NE on the deep layer neurons have not been examined. We accordingly studied the effects of NE on neuronal excitability in the deep layers by recording the holding currents at -55 mV from neurons in layer V and layer VI. Larger pyramidal neurons are the principal cells in layer V whereas small, densely packed neurons are the major cell type in layer VI. However, application of NE (100 μm) failed to change the holding currents recorded from layer V (-4.5 ± 3.6 pA, n = 15, p = 0.23, Fig. 1H) and layer VI (1.1 ± 1.0 pA, n = 10, p = 0.31, Fig. 1H) neurons. These results suggest that NE selectively inhibits neuronal excitability in the superficial layers of the EC with no effects on the deep layers. Because the maximal response ratio was observed in layer III pyramidal neurons, we recorded from this layer for the rest of the experiments to further explore the mechanisms underlying NE-mediated inhibition in the EC. NE Depresses Neuronal Excitability via Activation of α2A ARs—NE possesses high potency for α1, α2, and β1 ARs but has weak activity on β2 ARs. Activation of these receptors has been shown to generate opposite effects in basolateral amygdala neurons (41Buffalari D.M. Grace A.A. J. Neurosci... 2007; 27: 12358-12366Google Scholar). We next examined the roles of these receptors in NE-induced inhibition of neuronal excitability. Application of corynathine (100 μm), a selective α1 AR blocker, failed to alter NE-induced increases in outward holding currents (19.9 ± 2.1 pA, n = 5, p < 0.001, Fig. 2A). Neither did application of propranolol (100 μm), a β AR antagonist, significantly change NE-induced outward holding currents (21.9 ± 4.3 pA, n = 5, p = 0.007, Fig. 2B). However, application of yohimbine (50 μm), an α2 AR antagonist, completely prevented NE-induced changes in outward holding currents (0.7 ± 1.8 pA, n = 5, p = 0.73, Fig. 2C). Furthermore, application of UK14,30"

In addition to Foxc2 and Foxo1, we report that Foxf2, Foxp1, and Foxa1 are other members of the Fox family that show regulated expression during adipogenesis. Although enforced expression of FOXC2 inhibits adipogenesis, Foxf2 slightly enhances the rate of differentiation. Constitutively active FOXC2-VP16 inhibits adipogenesis through multiple mechanisms. FOXC2-VP16 impairs the transient induction of C/EBPβ during adipogenesis and induces expression of the transcriptional repressor Hey1 as well as the activator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, Wnt10b. The constitutive transcriptional repressor, FOXC2-Eng, enhances adipogenesis of preadipocytes and multipotent mesenchymal precursors and determines NIH-3T3 and C2C12 cells to the adipocyte lineage. Although PPARγ ligand or C/EBPα are not necessary for stimulation of adipogenesis by FOXC2-Eng, at least low levels of PPARγ protein are absolutely required. Finally, expression of FOXC2-Eng in adipocytes increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, further expanding the profound and pleiotropic effects of FOX transcription factors on adipocyte biology.

FOX (Forkhead box) proteins are a family of transcriptional regulators that are defined by a conserved 100-amino acid DNA-binding domain (DBD) 2The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA-binding domain; FCS, fetal calf serum; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; FABP4, fatty acid binding protein 4; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; MDI, methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin; MDI+T, MDI with troglitazone. and that regulate diverse cellular processes including differentiation, metabolism, development, proliferation, and apoptosis (1Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci... 2006; 63: 2317-2328Google Scholar, 2Wijchers P.J. Hoekman M.F. Burbach J.P. Smidt M.P. Brain Res... 2006; 1068: 23-33Google Scholar, 3Myatt S.S. Lam E.W. Nature Rev... 2007; 7: 847-859Google Scholar-4Arden K.C. Oncogene.. 2008; 27: 2345-2350Google Scholar). There are 17 FOX subfamilies, and at least 41 human genes have been identified (3Myatt S.S. Lam E.W. Nature Rev... 2007; 7: 847-859Google Scholar). Although the shared winged helix DBDs generally recognize and bind similar DNA elements, sequence specificity is achieved through interactions outside the DBD or through interactions with additional proteins (2Wijchers P.J. Hoekman M.F. Burbach J.P. Smidt M.P. Brain Res... 2006; 1068: 23-33Google Scholar). The regulated activities are diverse; some FOX proteins are exclusively transcriptional activators, some are transcriptional repressors, and some proteins are reported to have both activities. Foxa proteins serve as ""pioneer factors"" that modify chromatin access for other tissue-specific factors (1Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci... 2006; 63: 2317-2328Google Scholar). Nuclear exclusion mediated by phosphorylation appears to be exceedingly important for some subfamilies (e.g. Foxo, Foxa), but transcriptional control can also be achieved through post-translational modifications such as monoubiquitination and acetylation (2Wijchers P.J. Hoekman M.F. Burbach J.P. Smidt M.P. Brain Res... 2006; 1068: 23-33Google Scholar, 3Myatt S.S. Lam E.W. Nature Rev... 2007; 7: 847-859Google Scholar). Additional complexity is found through interaction with other transcription factors such as nuclear hormone receptors (2Wijchers P.J. Hoekman M.F. Burbach J.P. Smidt M.P. Brain Res... 2006; 1068: 23-33Google Scholar). The regulation of preadipocyte differentiation has been extensively studied, and a cascade of transcriptional events culminating in expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα has been partially defined (5Farmer S.R. Cell Metab... 2006; 4: 263-273Google Scholar, 6Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev... 1998; 78: 783-809Google Scholar, 7Rangwala S.M. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol... 2006; 7: 885-896Google Scholar). These master adipogenic transcription factors are under direct or indirect control by many other transcriptional regulators, including members of the FOX family (10Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell.. 2003; 4: 119-129Google Scholar, 11Armoni M. Harel C. Karni S. Chen H. Bar-Yoseph F. Ver M.R. Quon M.J. Karnieli E. J. Biol.

For example, expression of Foxo1, 3, and 4 is increased during adipogenesis coincident with expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, but Foxo1 activation is delayed until the end of clonal expansion (10Nakae J. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Biggs III, W.H. Arden K.C. Accili D. Dev. Cell.. 2003; 4: 119-129Google Scholar). Expression of a constitutively active Foxo1 mutant prevents the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and in adipocytes, Foxo1 physically interacts with C/EBPα to induce expression of adiponectin (13Qiao L. Shao J. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 39915-39924Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative Foxo1 mutant promotes adipogenesis in cultured cells and increases oxygen consumption and expression of brown adipocyte genes in white adipose tissue of transgenic mice (14Nakae J. Cao Y. Oki M. Orba Y. Sawa H. Kiyonari H. Iskandar K. Suga K. Lombes M. Hayashi Y. Diabetes.. 2008; 57: 563-576Google Scholar). Foxa2 also plays a role as a regulator of adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. Expression of Foxa2 is undetectable in adipose tissue of lean mice but is increased dramatically with diet-induced or genetic obesity (15Wolfrum C. Shih D.Q. Kuwajima S. Norris A.W. Kahn C.R. Stoffel M. J. Clin. Investig... 2003; 112: 345-356Google Scholar). In ob/ob mice, Foxa2 is expressed in both the stromal vascular and adipocyte fractions. Enforced expression in preadipocytes blocks adipogenesis through induction of Pref1 (i.e. Dlk1), whereas expression in adipocytes increases Glut4 and other genes involved in glucose metabolism. Mice haploinsufficient for Foxa2 are highly susceptible to diet-induced obesity, and adipocytes from these mice have profound alterations in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (15Wolfrum C. Shih D.Q. Kuwajima S. Norris A.W. Kahn C.R. Stoffel M. J. Clin. Investig... 2003; 112: 345-356Google Scholar). A third member of the FOX family with well investigated effects on adipocyte biology is Foxc2. Expression of Foxc2 is restricted to white and brown adipose tissue, and increased expression of human FOXC2 in adipose tissues of transgenic mice leads to a lean and insulin-sensitive phenotype (16Kim J.K. Kim H.J. Park S.Y. Cederberg A. Westergren R. Nilsson D. Higashimori T. Cho Y.R. Liu Z.X. Dong J. Cline G.W. Enerback S. Shulman G.I. Diabetes.. 2005; 54: 1657-1663Google Scholar, 17Cederberg A. Gronning L.M. Ahren B. Tasken K. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Cell.. 2001; 106: 563-573Google Scholar). In this context FOXC2 decreases white adipose tissue accumulation and dramatically expands the amount of brown adipose tissue by increasing sensitivity of the β-adrenergic cAMP protein kinase A signaling pathway through alteration of protein kinase A holoenzyme composition and expression of phosphodiesterase-4 (17Cederberg A. Gronning L.M. Ahren B. Tasken K. Carlsson P. Enerback S. Cell.. 2001; 106: 563-573Google Scholar, 18Gronning L.M. Baillie G.S. Cederberg A. Lynch M.J. Houslay M.D. Enerback S. Tasken K. FEBS Lett... 2006; 580: 4126-4130Google Scholar). Expression of Foxc2 is induced in preadipocyte models by tumor necrosis factor α and insulin, and enforced expression of Foxc2 blocks adipogenesis in part by inhibiting induction of a subset of PPARγ targets (12Davis K.E. Moldes M. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 42453-42461Google Scholar, 19Gronning L.M. Cederberg A. Miura N. Enerback S. Tasken K. Mol. Endocrinol... 2002; 16: 873-883Google Scholar). To further our understanding of the effects of FOX transcription factors on adipocyte differentiation and metabolism, we created fusion proteins containing the FOX DBD fused to either the herpes simplex virus transcriptional activator, VP16 to create a constitutively active transcription factor, or the Drosophila engrailed protein to make a constitutive transcriptional repressor. This approach circumvents much of the complex regulatory control discussed above and has been widely used for mechanistic analysis of other transcription factors, including FoxD3, retinoid-related orphan receptor γ, p53, Ptf1a, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, and PPARδ (20Steiner A.B.

In this manuscript we investigate mechanisms by which FOX transcription factors influence adipocyte determination, differentiation, and metabolism. Reagents—8-Bromo-cAMP (Calbiochem, La Jolla CA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Troglitazone (5 μm; Pfizer Inc., Groton CT) was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide. PD068235 was a generous gift from Pfizer Inc. Cytochalasin B was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—Maintenance and adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were as described previously using methylisobutylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin (MDI) (26Hemati N. Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Groblewski G.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 25913-25919Google Scholar). For adipogenesis, cells that had been confluent for 2 days (Day 0) were treated with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm methylisobutylxanthine, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 5 μm troglitazone. On day 2, the cells were fed 1 μg/ml insulin in 10% FCS media, and on day 4 and every 2 days thereafter, the cells were refed with 10% FCS. Lipid accumulation in adipocytes was visualized by staining with Oil Red-O (27Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 16348-16355Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from the American Type Tissue Culture repository. C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Marrow-derived ST2 cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that contained 10% FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. C/EBPα-/- MEFs were a kind gift from Gretchen Darlington (Baylor College of Medicine). PPARγ-/- fibroblasts were from Evan Rosen (Harvard University) (28Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev... 2002; 16: 22-26Google Scholar). Plasmids and Transfections—Full-length human FOXC2 (nucleotides 1192-3289, GenBank™ accession number Y08223) and the DBD of FOXC2 (amino acids 65-182 from NP005242) were subcloned from the pCB6+ vector into a retroviral plasmid pLCNX2. The constitutive FOX repressor, FOXC2-Eng, was created by fusion of the FOX DBD in-frame with the Drosophila engrailed transcriptional repressor domain. The constitutively active FOXC2, FOXC2-VP16, was created by cloning the FOXC2 DBD in-frame with the VP16 transcriptional activation domain. FOXC2-Eng and FOXC2-VP16 were created in pCB6+ and subsequently subcloned into retroviral vectors, pLXSN, pBABE PURO, and pMSCV PURO (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Full-length Foxf2 cDNA (NP010225) was subcloned into retroviral vector pLXSN. Hey1 was PCR-amplified from clone IMAGE6809680 (primers sense, 5′-ggatccgaccctcctcggagcccac-3′, and antisense, 5′-ttagaaagctccgatctctgtcc-3′) and subcloned into pBABE PURO. pMSCV-PPARγ was provided by Evan Rosen (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). pMSCV-C/EBPα was as described by Kang et al.

Wnt10a cDNA was subcloned into pNH2 retroviral vector (27Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 16348-16355Google Scholar) and Wnt10b into modified pTS13. Retroviral Transduction of Cells—293T cells (10-cm plates) were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with the viral packaging vectors SVϵ-E-MLV-env and SVψ-E-MLV in addition to retroviral vectors as indicated in the figure legends (7.5 μg of each). Virus-containing medium was collected 16 h after transfection and passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml. This medium was then applied to subconfluent (30% to 50%) cells in 10-cm plates. The infection protocol was repeated every 8-16 h until cells were 80% confluent. The cells were then trypsin-treated and replated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum or FCS and the appropriate antibiotic: 150 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) for pTS13-based vectors, 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for neomycin resistance-based vectors, or 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for pBABE/pMSCV-based vectors. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—One μg of total RNA was transcribed to cDNA using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. SYBR green I was used to monitor amplification of DNA on MyiQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). After amplification, melting curve analysis was performed as described by the manufacturer. Gene expression was normalized to 18 S, cyclophilin, or TATA box-binding protein RNAs, depending on the relative abundance of mRNA. Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of 18 S (29Kang S.

Glucose Uptake Assay—Day 8-11 NIH-3T3 adipocytes were incubated for 3 h in serum- and glucose-free medium. Basal and insulin-induced (100 nm) glucose uptake was measured by rinsing cells and then incubating for 30 min with or without insulin followed by addition of unlabeled 2-deoxy-d-glucose (20 μm) and 1 μCi of radiolabeled 2-deoxy-d-[14C]glucose (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). The results were corrected for nonspecific binding using controls run in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B. After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed in cold phosphate buffered saline and lysed in 750 μl of 0.1% SDS. We then added 250 μl to a scintillation vial, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter using 3 ml of Scinti-Verse scintillation liquid. Glucose uptake was normalized to protein content as measured from the remaining cell lysate with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Western Blots—Immunoblots were performed with antibodies specific for C/EBPβ (M. D. Lane, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), C/EBPα (a polyclonal antibody generated against a synthetic polypeptide corresponding to amino acids 253-265 (35Lin F.T. MacDougald O.A. Diehl A.M. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1993; 90: 9606-9610Google Scholar)), PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and FABP4 (David Bernlohr, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN). Laminin was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Bound horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody was visualized with Pierce Super Signal or Super Signal Ultra enhanced chemiluminescence substrates (Thermo Fisher). Regulated Expression of FOX Transcription Factors during Adipocyte Differentiation—To further our understanding of mechanisms by which FOX transcription factors influence adipocyte differentiation, we first evaluated the expression pattern of family members identified by Affymetrix gene profiling as having substantial expression during 3T3-L1 adipogenesis. We observed that Foxc2 is transiently induced with peak expression levels 8-24 h after induction of differentiation, whereas Foxo1 is expressed in adipocytes, with maximal expression levels reached by day 4 (Fig. 1A). In addition, we observed that Foxa1, Foxf2, and Foxp1 are also transiently induced with peak expression observed at 8 h. We did not find significant expression of Foxa2 (cycle threshold of ∼35), which is consistent with the observation that Foxa2 is expressed in adipose tissue only under conditions of obesity (15Wolfrum C. Shih D.Q. Kuwajima S. Norris A.W. Kahn C.R. Stoffel M. J. Clin. Investig... 2003; 112: 345-356Google Scholar). Collectively, the regulated expression of at least five members of the FOX family of transcription factors, Foxa1, Foxc2, Foxf2, Foxo1, and Foxp1, suggest complex and potentially overlapping functional roles for these proteins during adipogenesis. FOXC2 Blocks Adipocyte Differentiation, and Adipogenesis Is Rescued by C/EBPα or PPARγ—Consistent with prior published reports (12Davis K.E. Moldes M. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 42453-42461Google Scholar), ectopic expression of FOXC2 blocks adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 1B) as demonstrated by decreased neutral lipid accumulation and reduced expression of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and FABP4 proteins. To delineate at what level FOXC2 inhibits adipocyte differentiation, we tested whether enforced expression of C/EBPα or PPARγ is sufficient to rescue the inhibition of differentiation caused by FOXC2. To this end, we infected FOXC2-expressing cells with retroviruses carrying the genes for C/EBPα or PPARγ. After selection, the cells were induced to differentiate with MDI. Within 2 weeks, FOXC2-infected cells overexpressing C/EBPα or PPARγ acquired lipid droplets (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that FOXC2 represses differentiation by acting upstream of these adipogenic transcription factors, consistent with temporal expression of Foxc2 prior to C/EBPα and PPARγ (Fig. 1A) but counter to a prior report (12Davis K.E. Moldes M. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 42453-42461Google Scholar). In contrast, enforced expression of Foxf2 mildly stimulates adipocyte differentiation as observed by earlier acquisition of adipocyte morphology and expression of adipocyte genes (Fig. 1D). When we enforced expression of Foxp1 in 3T3-L1 cells, no change in adipocyte differentiation was observed (data not shown). Thus, members of the FOX family, although sharing similar expression patterns, can have opposing effects on adipogenesis. Effect of FOXC2-VP16 and FOXC2-Eng on Adipocyte Differentiation—To probe general mechanisms by which FOX transcription factors regulate adipogenesis, we used a strategy in which we evaluated effects of FOX transcription factors with constitutively active or dominant-negative activities. Specifically, we prepared constructs that drive the expression of chimeric proteins in which the DBDs of FOXC2 or Foxf2 are linked to either the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (VP16) or the engrailed repressor domain (Eng). As expected, FOXC2-VP16 activates, whereas FOXC2-Eng represses an artificial forkhead reporter gene (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, both chimeric proteins bind specifically to consensus forkhead binding sites in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1). Finally, fusions between FOXC2-VP16 or FOXC2-Eng with enhanced green fluorescent protein reveal that both chimeric proteins are exclusively nuclear when expressed in COS7 or HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown). We then enforced expression of FOXC2-Eng and FOXC2-VP16 in cell lines with variable adipogenic potential, including 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, ST2 mesenchymal precursor cells, C2C12 myoblasts, and C57Bl6 MEFs. Although no spontaneous differentiation was observed in the presence of FCS alone, FOXC2-Eng strongly increased adipocyte differentiation in all cell lines tested upon treatment with MDI, as determined by staining of neutral lipid (Fig. 2A and data not shown) and immunoblot analysis for FABP4 (Fig. 2B). Notably, this panel of cells includes C2C12 cells, which are committed to the myocyte lineage. In contrast to this, FOXC2-VP16 completely blocks adipocyte differentiation, even in the pro-adipogenic 3T3-L1 cell line and in the presence of a strong stimulus (i.e. addition of troglitazone to the differentiation mixture (MDI+T)). Similar results were observed with the Foxf2 chimeric constructs in 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). In summary, we found that a similar basic observation holds true across the cell models. FOXC2-VP16 is a very strong inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2 and data not shown), whereas FOXC2-Eng stimulates adipocyte differentiation and, in the cells investigated, alters commitment to the adipocyte lineage (Fig. 2). Characterization of FOXC2-VP16 or FOXC2-Eng Chimeras—To test whether the DBD had effects independent of the transcriptionally repressive engrailed domain, we also enforced expression of the FOXC2 DBD alone in NIH-3T3 cells and found that it did not promote adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 2C). To exclude that the effects on adipogenesis were due to the engrailed repressor domain or the VP16 activation domain, we also overexpressed fusion proteins of engrailed or VP16 with the Gal4 DBD and found no alterations in adipocyte differentiation compared with control cells (data not shown). To establish whether FOXC2 and FOXC2-VP16 inhibit differentiation at a similar point, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were sequentially and stably infected with FOXC2-VP16 and then with either pBabe, C/EBPα, or PPARγ and induced to differentiate. As observed for full-length FOXC2 (Fig. 1C), differentiation is completely blocked in preadipocytes that express FOXC2-VP16; again, stable overexpression of C/EBPα or PPARγ rescues this phenotype and leads to a high frequency of differentiation into adipocytes (Fig. 2D). These data are consistent with the notion that FOXC2 and FOXC2-VP16 exert their effects by a similar mechanism. Ectopic Expression of FOXC2-Eng Stimulates Adipogenesis of C/EBPα-/- MEFs—As described above, sustained expression of FOXC2 prevents adipogenesis upstream of C/EBPα. We therefore sought to clarify whether the pro-adipogenic effect of the chimeric transcriptional repressor FOXC2-Eng is dependent on C/EBPα. To this end we retrovirally infected C/EBPα-/- MEFs with control vector (pLXSN) or vectors containing C/EBPα or FOXC2-Eng. These cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes with MDI+T. As expected (36Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 3: 151-158Google Scholar), C/EBPα-/- MEFs infected with control vector did not differentiate, whereas cells infected with C/EBPα acquired lipid droplets within 10 days (Fig. 3A). Importantly, FOXC2-Eng also robustly stimulated adipogenesis of C/EBPα-/- MEFs as assessed by phase contrast microscopy or immunoblot analysis for FABP4 (Fig. 3A). Because C/EBPα is not expressed in adipocytes ectopically expressing FOXC2-Eng (Fig. 3A), FOXC2-Eng bypasses or perhaps replaces C/EBPα to stimulate expression of adipocyte genes. FOXC2-Eng Promotes Insulin-stimulated Glucose Uptake—NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were infected with control retroviral vector (pMSCV) or retroviruses containing C/EBPα or FOXC2-Eng. Between days 9 and 11 after induction of differentiation by MDI, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was measured. As previously demonstrated (36Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 3: 151-158Google Scholar, 37El-Jack A.K. Hamm J.K. Pilch P.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 7946-7951Google Scholar), expression of C/EBPα in NIH-3T3 cells confers the acquisition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Furthermore, adipocytes that express FOXC2-Eng were also insulin-sensitive (Fig. 3B) despite the fact that endogenous C/EBPα was not expressed (Fig. 3B). These data provide further evidence that FOXC2-Eng functionally replaces C/EBPα and mediates not only the differentiation process into adipocytes but also the acquisition of glucose uptake in response to insulin. FOXC2-Eng Stimulates Adipogenesis in the Presence of a PPARγ Inhibitor but Not in the Complete Absence of PPARγ—To understand further the mechanisms through which FOXC2-Eng stimulates adipogenesis, we treated control and FOXC2-Eng 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with a PPARγ inhibitor (PD068235) and evaluated effects on adipocyte differentiation. As expected, the control cells treated with the PPARγ inhibitor did not differentiate (Fig. 4A), but surprisingly, the cells expressing FOXC2-Eng underwent differentiation (Fig. 4A). Western blot analyses for C/EBPα, PPARγ, or FABP4 show that adipocyte markers are indeed highly expressed in the presence of FOXC2-Eng plus the PPARγ inhibitor (Fig. 4A). To determine whether FOXC2-Eng stimulates differentiation of cells in the absence of PPARγ, we infected PPARγ-/- fibroblasts with PPARγ or FOXC2-Eng and induced them to differentiate in the presence of MDI+T. As previously described (28Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev... 2002; 16: 22-26Google Scholar), PPARγ-/- fibroblasts do not differentiate on their own but accumulate lipid and express adipocyte genes in response to ectopic expression of PPARγ (Fig. 4B). However, in contrast to the strong adipogenesis observed with FOXC2-Eng in the absence of C/EBPα or in the presence of a PPARγ antagonist, FOXC2-Eng is not sufficient to cause differentiation of PPARγ-/- fibroblasts (Fig. 4B). These data are consistent with a model where ligand availability regulates the dynamics of PPARγ activity, but even in the presence of an antagonist, PPARγ protein or basal activity is indispensible for adipogenesis. Does Wnt Signaling Play a Role in the Effects of FOXC2-Eng or FOXC2-VP16 on Adipogenesis?—To explore further the interplay between FOXC2-Eng and pathways known to regulate adipogenesis, we ectopically expressed FOXC2-Eng in 3T3-L1 cells already expressing Wnt10a. Expression of Wnt10b (38Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Sciences (N. Y.).. 2000; 289: 950-953Google Scholar) or Wnt10a (Fig. 5A) in 3T3-L1 cells blocks adipocyte differentiation. In this context, FOXC2-Eng is not able to overcome the block"
https://openalex.org/W2043718702,"To ascertain the identities of cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins that mediate the insulin secretagogue action of cAMP, the possible contributions of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) and protein kinase A (PKA) were evaluated in a pancreatic beta cell line (rat INS-1 cells). Assays of Rap1 activation, CREB phosphorylation, and PKA-dependent gene expression were performed in combination with live cell imaging and high throughput screening of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based cAMP sensor (Epac1-camps) to validate the selectivity with which acetoxymethyl esters (AM-esters) of cAMP analogs preferentially activate Epac or PKA. Selective activation of Epac or PKA was achieved following exposure of INS-1 cells to 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM or Bt2cAMP-AM, respectively. Both cAMP analogs exerted dose-dependent and glucose metabolism-dependent actions to stimulate insulin secretion, and when each was co-administered with the other, a supra-additive effect was observed. Because 2.4-fold more insulin was secreted in response to a saturating concentration (10 μm) of Bt2cAMP-AM as compared with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM, and because the action of Bt2cAMP-AM but not 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM was nearly abrogated by treatment with 3 μm of the PKA inhibitor H-89, it is concluded that for INS-1 cells, it is PKA that acts as the dominant cAMP-binding protein in support of insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, 10–100 μm of the non-AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP failed to stimulate insulin secretion and was a weak activator of Rap1 in INS-1 cells. Moreover, 10 μm of the AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP stimulated insulin secretion from mouse islets, whereas the non-AM-ester did not. Thus, the membrane permeability of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP in insulin-secreting cells is so low as to limit its biological activity. It is concluded that prior reports documenting the failure of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP to act in beta cells, or other cell types, need to be re-evaluated through the use of the AM-ester of this cAMP analog.

Epac1 and Epac2 are guanine nucleotide exchange factors activated by adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), and which are known to be expressed in numerous mammalian cell types (1de Rooij J.

Selective activation of Epac may be achieved through the use of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate, also known as 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (4Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. Triest M.V. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol... 2002; 4: 901-906Google Scholar, 5Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R.

This cAMP analog, which incorporates a 2′-O-methyl group on the ribose ring of the nucleotide, as well as a 4-chlorophenylthio group on position 8 of the adenine moiety, acts as a ""superactivator"" of Epac while having a greatly diminished ability to activate PKA (4Enserink J.M.

Signal... 2008; 20: 10-20Google Scholar). 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP can cross the plasma membrane and is able to alter diverse cellular functions that include Rap1 GTPase activity, PKB, and ERK1/2 protein kinase activity, phospholipase Cϵ activity, Ca2+ signaling, ion channel activity, exocytosis, cell adhesion, and gene expression (7Seino S.

Although no selective antagonist of Epac activation exists, these effects of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP are believed to be Epac-mediated because they are observed under conditions in which PKA activity is blocked, whereas they are reduced or eliminated when Epac gene expression is down-regulated. Furthermore, such actions of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP are measurable in cells that do not express the cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channels that constitute an alternative target of cAMP action. Interestingly, published findings exist in which cAMP-elevating agents were found to exert actions not attributable to their effects at PKA or cyclic nucleotide-regulated ion channels, and which were not replicated upon administration of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (10Gambaryan S.

Thus, there may exist actions of cAMP that are independent of the known cAMP-binding proteins. Alternatively, it is possible that in some cell types, access of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP to the cytosol is so poor that it limits its ability to activate Epac. If so, prior reports concerning the failure of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP to influence various cellular functions need to be re-evaluated, possibly through use of an acetoxymethyl ester (AM-ester) of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP that was recently synthesized by Vliem and co-workers (15Vliem M.J. Ponsioen B. Schwede F. Pannekoek W.J. Riedl J. Kooistra M.R. Jalink K. Genieser H.G. Bos J.L. Rehmann H. ChemBioChem.. 2008; 9: 2052-2054Google Scholar). This ESCA (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM) has greater membrane permeability and it is metabolized by intracellular esterases, thereby generating the free biologically active 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. In the present study we have used a cAMP reporter (Epac1-camps) (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 37215-37218Google Scholar) that exhibits a decrease of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) when it binds to cAMP (or various cAMP analogs), to demonstrate a surprisingly poor membrane permeability of the non-AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP in rat INS-1 cells (an insulin-secreting cell line used as a model system for the study of pancreatic beta cell function) (17Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology.. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar). We also report that the AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP has improved membrane permeability while retaining Epac selectivity, as demonstrated in assays of INS-1 cell Rap1 activation, CREB phosphorylation, and PKA-dependent gene expression. Furthermore, we report that although 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP is known to exhibit low-affinity binding to the regulatory subunits of PKA in vitro (5Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R. Tang X.B. Christensen A.E. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Bos J.L. Doskeland S.O. Beavo J.A. Butt E. Nat. Methods.. 2008; 5: 277-288Google Scholar), treatment of INS-1 cells with the AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP does not interfere with the ability of endogenous cAMP to activate PKA-dependent gene expression that is under the control of a cyclic AMP response element (CRE). By comparing the insulin secretagogue action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM with that of the PKA-selective cAMP analog N6,2′-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate-AM (Bt2cAMP-AM), we have established the relative importance of Epac and PKA to the cAMP-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion from INS-1 cells. We conclude that prior reports documenting the failure of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP to act in beta cells, or other cell types, need to be re-evaluated through the use of the AM-ester of this cAMP analog. Cell Culture—INS-1 cells (passage numbers 70–90) were maintained in a humidified incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm Hepes, 11.1 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml-1 penicillin G, 100 μgml-1 streptomycin, 2.0 mm l-glutamine, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (17Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology.. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar). INS-1 cells were passaged by trypsinization and subcultured once a week. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Live Cell Imaging of Epac1-camps—INS-1 cells adherent to glass coverslips were imaged after transient transfection and expression of a cAMP FRET reporter (Epac1-camps) that incorporates the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of Epac1 flanked at its N terminus by yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and at its C terminus by cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 37215-37218Google Scholar). The cells were bathed in a standard extracellular saline (SES) solution containing (in mm): 138 NaCl, 5.6 KCl, 2.6 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 11.1 glucose, and 10 Hepes (295 mosmol, pH 7.4). Imaging of cells was performed using a Nikon TE-300 inverted microscope equipped with a N.A. 1.45 TIRF objective (×60, Nikon), a CARV2 filter changer under computer control (BD Bioscience), an X-CITE light source with a mercury vapor short arc lamp (EXFO), and a Cascade 512b EMCCD camera (Roper Scientific). Ratiometric analysis of the emitted light corresponding to fluorescence originating within a defined region of the cytoplasm was performed using a Chameleon-2 filter set (Chroma Technology Corp.) comprised of a D440/20 excitation filter, a 455DCLP dichroic, and D485/40 (CFP) or D535/30 (YFP) emission filters. Images were acquired and processed using Metafluor version 7.5 software (Molecular Devices). Detailed methods of live cell FRET imaging using this reporter are provided in our prior collaborative reports (18Landa Jr. L.R. Harbeck M. Kaihara K. Chepurny O. Kitiphongspattana K. Graf O.

High Throughput Assay of Epac1-camps—An INS-1 cell clone (C-10) stably expressing Epac1-camps was generated by G418 selection after transfection of cells with the Epac1-camps coding sequence in pcDNA3.1 (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 37215-37218Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 80% confluence on 96-well clear bottom assay plates (Costar 3904) and maintained in culture medium overnight prior to their use. Assays were performed using a FlexStation 3 microplate reader equipped with excitation and emission monochromators, and controlled using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices). After replacement of the culture medium with 170 μl/well of the SES solution, the excitation light was delivered at 435/9 nm (455 nm cut-off), and the emitted light was detected at 485/15 nm (CFP) or 535/15 nm (YFP). The excitation light source was a Xenon flash lamp, and the emission intensities were the average of 12 excitation flashes for each time point. Test solutions comprised of cAMP analogs dissolved in the SES solution containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide were placed in V-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner) and an automated pipetting procedure was used to transfer 30 μl of each test solution to the assay plate containing the cells. The test solutions were injected into each well at a pipette height that corresponded to a fluid level of 150 μl, and the rate of injection was 31 μl/s. The CFP/YFP emission ratio was calculated for each well, and values for 24–36 wells were averaged. The time course of the change of FRET ratio was then plotted after exporting these data to Origin version 7.5 (OriginLab). Live Cell Imaging of Epac1-EGFP—INS-1 cells were transfected with a construct directing expression of a protein comprised of human Epac1 fused to EGFP at its C terminus (20Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 26581-26586Google Scholar). Clones of cells stably expressing this reporter were obtained by G418 selection. Live cell imaging and data analysis was performed using a LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope, a ×100 objective, and AxioVision 4.30 software (Zeiss). Rap1 Activation Assay—Activation of Rap1 by cAMP-elevating agents was assayed by Western blot analysis using lysates derived from INS-1 cells transiently transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged Rap1 and Epac1 using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). The methods used in this Ral-GDS-RBD-GST pull-down assay employing glutathione-conjugated agarose beads are described elsewhere (1de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature.. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar). The activated Rap1-GTP and the total Rap1 were detected using an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, catalog number A8592). CREB Phosphorylation Assay—The phosphorylated form of CREB was assayed by Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-Ser133 CREB polyclonal antiserum (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9191). Immunoreactivity corresponding to the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of CREB (i.e. total CREB) was measured using a monoclonal 48H2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9197). An horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antiserum (Sigma, catalog number A6667) was used in combination with these two primary antisera. Immunoreactivity was imaged using a SuperSignal West Pico ECL detection system (Thermo Science) and a ChemiDoc XRS gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). CRE-Luc Reporter Gene Assay—RIP1-CRE-Luc comprised of a 4-fold multimerized CRE found within the rat insulin I gene promoter, and fused to the coding sequence of firefly luciferase in pLuc-MCS (21Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Biomol. Screen... 2007; 12: 740-746Google Scholar), was introduced into INS-1 cells by transient transfection. After overnight incubation in cell culture medium, the cells were exposed for 4 h to serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and the indicated test substances. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase-catalyzed photoemissions using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a FlexStation 3 microplate reader in the luminometer mode (Molecular Devices). Insulin Secretion Assay—INS-1 cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/well onto 96-well plates (Costar) after coating the plates with rat tail collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products). After overnight equilibration in culture medium, the medium was replaced with 100 μl/well Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRBH) containing test substances. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the buffer was collected, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the insulin content determined by radioimmunoassay (Millipore, Sensitive Rat Insulin RIA, catalog number SRI-13K) or by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Mercodia Ultrasensitive Rat Insulin ELISA, catalog number 10-1137-01). The amount of insulin in each sample was determined by comparison with a standard curve generated using calibrated samples of rat insulin provided with these kits. Assays were performed in duplicate. Analysis of Data—The repeatability of all findings presented here was confirmed by performing each experiment a minimum of two times. Values of fold-stimulation correspond to measurements obtained in a single experiment. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's paired t test and SigmaStat (Systat Software, Inc.). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Sources and Preparation of Reagents—cAMP analogs and phosphate-AM3 were synthesized by BIOLOG Life Science Institute (Germany). All AM-esters were applied under serum-free conditions to avoid extracellular hydrolysis. H-89, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine were from Sigma. Epac1-camps in pcDNA3.1 was from M. Lohse (Germany). FLAG-Rap1 in pCMV2 was from L. Quilliam (United States). RalGDS-RBD-GST in pGEX was from J. L. Bos (Netherlands). Epac1-EGFP in pEGFP-N3 was from X. Cheng (United States). FLAG-Epac1 in pCMV2 was generated in our laboratory using the human Epac1 cDNA (1de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature.. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar). The AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP Activates Epac1-camps in INS-1 Cells—The biochemical properties of ESCAs are measurable through the use of a genetically encoded biosensor in which the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of Epac1 is fused to YFP and CFP. This biosensor, designated as Epac1-camps, exhibits a decrease of FRET when it binds to cAMP or various cAMP analogs (16Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 37215-37218Google Scholar). Epac1-camps reported global changes of [cAMP] in the cytosol of INS-1 cells because unlike full-length Epac1 that was expressed at the plasma membrane and perinuclear membrane (Fig. 1A), Epac1-camps was homogeneously distributed within the cytoplasm, with nuclear exclusion clearly evident (Fig. 1B). When 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM was applied to the extracellular surface of individual INS-1 cells expressing Epac1-camps, resultant activation of the biosensor could be monitored in real time by performing spectrofluorimetry in combination with live cell imaging. Thus, a 50-s application of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (20 μm) produced a decrease of FRET that was measured as an increase of the CFP/YFP (485/535 nm) emission ratio (Fig. 1, C and D). Remarkably, no such increase of emission ratio was measured using an equivalent concentration of the non-AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, application of 6.6 μm phosphate-AM3, a control AM-ester that liberates 3 mol eq of acetic acid and formaldehyde per mol of phosphate when it is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases, failed to produce a change of FRET (Fig. 1D). Such findings indicate that the AM-ester substitution of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP dramatically improved its membrane permeability, thereby allowing it to activate Epac1-camps in INS-1 cells. The dose dependence with which 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM activates Epac1-camps may be determined using a high throughput assay in which INS-1 cells stably expressing the biosensor are monitored using a plate-reading spectrofluorimeter equipped with single excitation and dual emission wavelength monochromators. Under these conditions, application of 0.3 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM to an INS-1 cell monolayer produced a significant increase of the 485/535 nm emission ratio within 100 s following its application (Fig. 2A). Higher concentrations of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM increased both the magnitude and rate of onset of this response (Fig. 2A). The non-AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was considerably less potent in this assay because no increase of emission ratio was measured in response to 10 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP. However, a dose-dependent action of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was apparent when it was tested at 30 and 100 μm (Fig. 2B). Despite this fact, the change of emission ratio measured in response to 100 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was considerably smaller than that which was measured in response to 1.0 μm 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (Fig. 2B). Although not illustrated, the activation of Epac1-camps by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM was unaffected by treatment of INS-1 cells with 10 μm H-89, an isoquinolinesulfonamide that is a moderately selective inhibitor of PKA (22Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J... 2000; 351: 95-105Google Scholar). Activation of Rap1 by 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM Is Dose- and Time-dependent—The dose and time dependence with which an ESCA activates Epac may also be indirectly ascertained through the use of a Rap1 activation assay (1de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature.. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar). In INS-1 cells expressing recombinant human Epac1 and FLAG epitope-tagged Rap1, a 30-min treatment with the non-AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (0.1–3.0 μm) produced a weak activation of Rap1 (Fig. 3A, left panel). However, a stronger and dose-dependent activation of Rap1 was measured in response to equivalent concentrations of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (Fig. 3A, right panel). This effect of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM was measured within 2.5 min following exposure of INS-1 cells to the ESCA (Fig. 3B). Given that prior studies of other cell types have linked increased PKA activity to Rap1 activation (23Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell.. 1997; 89: 73-82Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the Rap1 activation function of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM described here for INS-1 cells was reproduced by the AM-ester of N6,2′-O-dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP-AM), which exhibits PKA selectivity as a consequence of its substitution at position 6 on the adenine moiety of cAMP (24Schultz C. Vajanaphanich M. Harootunian A.T. Sammak P.J. Barrett K.E. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 6316-6322Google Scholar, 25Bartsch M. Zorn-Kruppa M. Kühl N. Genieser H.G. Schwede F. Jastorff B.

Chem... 2003; 278: 35394-35402Google Scholar). We found that treatment of INS-1 cells with Bt2cAMP-AM resulted in a weaker activation of Rap1, even when the concentration of Bt2cAMP-AM was raised to 10 μm (Fig. 3C). This effect of Bt2cAMP-AM was mediated by PKA rather than by Epac because Bt2cAMP-AM failed to activate Rap1 when INS-1 cells were pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the ability of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM to activate Rap1 was unaffected by H-89 (Fig. 3C). Thus, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM exerted a potent dose- and time-dependent action to activate Rap1, an effect that was mediated by Epac. However, Bt2cAMP-AM acted through PKA rather than Epac to activate Rap1. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM Fails to Stimulate PKA-dependent Gene Expression—Although prior in vitro studies demonstrated the selectivity with which the non-AM-ester of 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP activates Epac (4Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. Triest M.V. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Døskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol... 2002; 4: 901-906Google Scholar, 5Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R.

Chem... 2003; 278: 35394-35402Google Scholar), concern exists that this cAMP analog might have the unwanted side effect to indirectly activate PKA in living cells. This concern is prompted by the finding that 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP acts in vitro to inhibit the activity of certain isoforms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (5Poppe H. Rybalkin S.D. Rehmann H. Hinds T.R. Tang X.B. Christensen A.E. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Bos J.L. Doskeland S.O. Beavo J.A. Butt E. Nat. Methods.. 2008; 5: 277-288Google Scholar, 27Laxman S. Riechers A. Sadilek M. Schwede F. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2006; 103: 19194-19199Google Scholar). Thus, under conditions in which PDEs bind 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, the hydrolysis of endogenous cAMP in living cells might be slowed, thereby leading to increased levels of cAMP with accompanying activation of PKA. For INS-1 cells, such a confounding effect does not appear to be of major importance because when these cells were transfected with a PKA-activated luciferase reporter (RIP1-CRE-Luc) in which luciferase expression was placed under the control of a multimerized CRE present within the rat insulin I gene promoter (RIP1) (21Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Biomol. Screen... 2007; 12: 740-746Google Scholar), 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM failed to stimulate luciferase expression (Fig. 4A). In these same cells the PKA-selective cAMP analog Bt2cAMP-AM (1–10 μm) stimulated luciferase expression up to 20-fold, and this effect was reduced by the PKA inhibitor H-89 (Fig. 4A). Because it is the PKA-phosphorylated form of transcription factor CREB that binds to the CRE and which transactivates gene expression (28Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1997; 66: 807-822Google Scholar), the differential efficacies of Bt2cAMP-AM and 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM in these assays of RIP1-CRE-Luc activity might be explained by an ability, or lack of ability, of the cAMP analogs to promote CREB phosphorylation. This was the case because we found that in INS-1 cells, Bt2cAMP-AM (0.3–10 μm) promoted Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB, whereas no such effect was observed using 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (Fig. 4B, Ser133 is the residue at which PKA phosphorylates CREB) (28Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1997; 66: 807-822Google Scholar). As expected, the phosphorylation of CREB was also increased by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin administered with the PDE inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (Fig. 4B). 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM Does Not Prevent PKA Activation by Endogenous cAMP—Despite the selectivity with which 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM activates Epac, it is possible that this ESCA might also exhibit low affinity binding to the regulatory subunits of PKA (26Christensen A.E.

This was not the case for INS-1 cells because a 15-min pretreatment with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM (10 μm) failed to reduce RIP1-CRE-Luc activation by the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 (Fig. 4C, left panel). Similarly, pretreatment with 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP-AM failed to reduce RIP1-CRE-Luc activation by forskolin or N6-benzyl-cAMP-AM (Fig. 4C, right panel). Exendin-4 and forskolin are stimulators of cAMP producti"
https://openalex.org/W2040585628,"Extracellular RNA has been shown to induce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent hyperpermeability in vivo as well as in vitro. Studies were performed to investigate the mechanism of these effects. For permeability studies primary cultures of porcine brain-derived microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and for all other analytical studies the human brain endothelial cell line HCMEC/D3 or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used. RNA, but not DNA, initiated signaling events by binding of VEGF to neuropilin-1, followed by VEGF-R2 phosphorylation, activation of phospholipase C (PLC), and intracellular release of Ca(2+). Activation of these pathways by RNA also resulted in the release of von Willebrand Factor from Weibel-Palade bodies. Pretreatment of cells with heparinase totally abrogated the RNA-induced permeability changes, whereas RNA together with VEGF completely restored VEGF-R2-mediated hyperpermeability. Although poly:IC increased the interleukin-6 release via activation of toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3), permeability changes mediated by poly:IC or RNA remained unchanged after blocking TLR-3 or NF-kB activation. These results indicate that extracellular RNA serves an important cofactor function to engage VEGF for VEGF-R2-dependent signal transduction, reminiscent of the coreceptor mechanism mediated by proteoglycans, which might be of relevance for the mobilization and cellular activities of RNA-binding cytokines in general."
https://openalex.org/W2154406084,"Liver plays a major role in regulating energy homeostasis in mammals. During feeding conditions, excessive glucose is converted into a preferred storage form of energy sources as triacylglycerol in liver via a collective metabolic pathway termed lipogenesis. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c is a master regulator for this process by activating number of enzyme genes, such as Fasn or Acaca, that are involved in this pathway at the transcriptional level. Here we show that the salt-inducible kinase (SIK) family of proteins regulates the hepatic lipogenesis by modulating SREBP-1c activity. Overexpression of SIK1 inhibits hepatic expression of lipogenic genes, such as Fasn, whereas knockdown of SIK1 in liver greatly enhances their expression. Regulation of the Fasn gene by SIK kinases is mediated at the level of transcription via phosphorylation and inactivation of nuclear SREBP-1c. Among candidate sites for SIK-dependent regulation of SREBP-1c, the serine 329 residue is shown to be a critical regulatory site for SIK-mediated repression of SREBP-1c activity by in vitro kinase assay and reverse transcription-PCR analysis in primary hepatocytes. Finally, reduced hepatic triacylglycerol levels and lipogenic gene expression by adenoviral SIK1 transgenic expression are restored to normal levels by co-infection of mutant SREBP-1c, suggesting that SIK-dependent regulation of hepatic lipogenesis is indeed mediated through the phosphorylation of SREBP-1c in vivo. The process for the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver involves de novo lipogenesis via the activation of SREBP-1c. Modulation of SREBP-1c activity by SIK proteins would provide an attractive means for the regulation of such diseases. Liver plays a major role in regulating energy homeostasis in mammals.

Modulation of SREBP-1c activity by SIK proteins would provide an attractive means for the regulation of such diseases. The mammalian liver is a primary organ for regulating energy homeostasis. After the food intake, high levels of glucose are transported to the liver through the bloodstream. Initially, the remnant of glucose not utilized immediately is metabolized into glycogen. For the longer term storage, excess glucose is converted into triglycerides via a collective metabolic pathway termed lipogenesis that includes glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and triglyceride synthesis and maturation. The control of lipogenesis during feeding conditions is achieved via the activation of key rate-limiting enzymes both at the enzyme activity and at the level of gene expression (1Towle H.C.

The latter regulatory mechanism is considered as an adaptive response and, in many cases, is achieved by the enhanced transcription of lipogenic genes, such as Fasn (fatty acid synthase) or Acaca (acetyl-CoA carboxylase α). The control of lipogenic gene expression is coordinately regulated by various hormonal and nutritional cues. Inhibition of such gene expression is achieved by fasting hormone glucagon or its intracellular signal, cAMP-mediated transcriptional repression (5Lemaigre F.P. Rousseau G.G. Biochem. J... 1994; 303: 1-14Google Scholar). Expression of genes in this pathway is also down-regulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggesting a mechanism for a feedback inhibition by its end-point product of lipogenesis (6Clarke S.D.

SREBP is first synthesized as a precursor form that contains the N-terminal transcription factor domains and C-terminal regulatory domain linked with a central transmembrane domain.

This process is also shown to be activated during feeding conditions in liver, although the exact mechanism has not been demonstrated to date. Among family members, the SREBP-1c isoform is implicated as a master transcriptional regulator for the hepatic lipogenesis.

The development of this disease is characterized with increased de novo lipogenesis in part due to the hyperactivation of lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1c, underscoring the importance of tight regulation of SREBP-1c and hepatic fatty acid synthesis (27Kohjima M.

Overexpression of SIK1 reduces lipogenic gene expression, whereas hepatic knockdown of SIK1 leads to the enhanced expression of SREBP-1c target genes. SREBP-1c is shown to be a direct substrate for SIK1 in vitro. Mutation of a major regulatory site serine 329 to alanine on SREBP-1c negates the effects of SIK1 in SREBP-1c target gene expression and hepatic triglyceride levels in mice. These data suggest that SIK1-dependent regulation of SREBP-1c activity would be critical in the modulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis. Materials—T0901317 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. Cultures of Primary Hepatocytes—Rat primary hepatocytes were prepared from Sprague-Dawley rats, as described (32Koo S.H. Satoh H. Herzig S. Lee C.H. Hedrick S. Kulkarni R. Evans R.M. Olefsky J.

M2 monoclonal antibody (for FLAG) was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody against FAS was kindly provided by Prof. Kyung-Sup Kim (Yonsei University, Korea). Quantitative PCR—Total RNA from either primary hepatocytes or liver tissue was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). cDNAs generated by Superscript II enzyme (Invitrogen) were analyzed by quantitative PCR using a SYBR Green PCR kit and TP800 thermal cycler DICE real time system (TAKARA). All data were normalized to ribosomal L32 expression.

Cell.. 2004; 119: 61-74Google Scholar). nSREBP-1c occupancy over the FAS promoter was analyzed by PCR with primers for rat Fasn (forward, ggcggccacgccacatgggctgacagc; reverse, ccccggcgctcctcagtcccagcccca). Statistical Analyses—Results represent mean ± S.E. The comparison of different groups was carried out using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test as described (36Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J. Yates III, J. Montminy M. Nature.. 2007; 449: 366-369Google Scholar). Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. Expression of Lipogenic Genes Are Regulated by SIK in Liver—Previously, we have shown that expression of SIKs inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis via phosphorylation of the serine 171 residue of CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2) (also known as TORC2) (33Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature.. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the nature of potential signaling cascades that are regulated by SIK kinases, we performed two sets of microarray analysis using RNAs from mouse liver infected with adenoviruses, one with either Ad-GFP or Ad-SIK1 adenoviruses and the other with either Ad-US control or Ad-SIK1 RNA interference adenoviruses. As shown in Table 1, known target genes in the gluconeogenesis, such as G6pc (glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit) and Pcx (pyruvate carboxylase) are regulated by changes in SIK1 expression, as reported previously (33Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature.. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Google Scholar). Surprisingly, genes involved in the lipogenesis, such as Fasn, Acaca, and Gpd1 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1) are up-regulated by SIK1 knockdown, whereas expression levels of such genes are generally shown to be lower with SIK1 overexpression, suggesting that SIK1 could also regulate lipogenic gene transcription. Expression of Srebf1, a gene encoding a major transcriptional regulator SREBP-1c for this process, or Thrsp (thyroid hormone-responsive SPOT14 homolog) is also regulated by SIK similarly to other lipogenic genes. Interestingly, genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis or uptake are generally unaffected (aminoacylase 1, Fdps (farnesyl diphosphate synthetase), Ggdps (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1), Ldlr (low density lipoprotein receptor), and Pmvk (phosphomevalonate kinase)) by either SIK1 overexpression or knockdown. Interestingly, Hmgcs1 (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1) expression is rather increased in SIK1-infected mouse liver, showing a lack of general regulatory mechanisms on cholesterol synthetic enzyme gene expression by SIK. Indeed, changes in expression levels of selected lipogenic genes are confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1, A and B) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1C), showing that SIK could regulate lipogenic gene expression in an in vivo setting.Table 1Microarray analysis showing hepatic expression patterns of metabolic genes by SIK1 overexpression or knockdown Gene -Fold induction SIK1 versus GFP SIKI RNAi versus US Srebf1 0.571 1.347 Acaca 0.991 1.764 Fasn 0.652 1.416 Thrsp 0.680 7.360 Gpd1 0.622 1.502 G6pc 0.819 1.399 Pcx 0.853 1.257 Pmvk 0.952 0.852 Hmgcs1 1.337 0.683 Fdps 0.741 0.832 Ldlr 1.125 1.080 Acy1 0.959 1.051 Ggps1 1.234 1.15 Open table in a new tab SIK Regulates SREBP-1c-mediated Transcription in Primary Hepatocytes—To rule out potential secondary effects of adenovirus-mediated SIK overexpression or knockdown on lipogenic gene expression in the liver, we transduced primary hepatocytes with Ad-SIK1 adenovirus or Ad-GFP control viruses. Indeed, adenoviral overexpression of SIK1 reduces mRNA levels of Fasn in primary hepatocytes, showing that the effects of SIK1 adenoviral infection in mouse could be replicated by SIK1 expression in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). As shown previously, AMPK or adiponectin could also reduce Fasn expression, suggesting that SIK may regulate lipogenic gene expression in a similar manner as does AMPK (37Da Silva Morais A. Lebrun V. Abarca-Quinones J. Brichard S. Hue L. Guigas B. Viollet B. Leclercq I.A. J. Hepatol... 2009; 50: 489-500Google Scholar). Recently, LXR-mediated SREBP-1c expression was shown to be regulated by AMPK activity in hepatic cells (38Yang J. Craddock L. Hong S. Liu Z.M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2009; 106: 414-426Google Scholar). Indeed, we were able to show that LXR ligand T0901317-mediated induction of mRNAs for Fasn or Srebf1 are effectively blocked by adenoviral SIK overexpression in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2B). LXR-dependent induction of Srebf1 promoter activity is also reduced by SIK1 expression (Fig. 2C). However, SREBP-1c-mediated enhancement of Fasn promoter activity are also reduced by SIK1 overexpression in hepatocytes (Fig. 2D), suggesting that SIK1 could not only regulate SREBP-1c expression but also could regulate its activity to modulate hepatic lipogenic gene expression. SIK Directly Modifies SREBP-1c at Three Serine Residues within the b/HLH/LZ Domain—As members of the AMPK-related kinases, SIK proteins phosphorylate serine or threonine residues that are a fixed distance from basic and hydrophobic amino acids (HBXX(S/T)XXH, where H represents a hydrophobic amino acid, B is a basic amino acid, X is any amino acid, and S/T is serine/threonine) (35Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates III, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M. Cell.. 2004; 119: 61-74Google Scholar). Close investigation of amino acid sequences of SREBP-1c revealed three potential serine residues at amino acid positions 265, 266, and 329 that are conserved among mouse, rat, and human species and could be phosphorylated by SIK kinases (Fig. 3, A and C). Consequently, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitated FLAG-SIK1 together with four purified GST-fused nSREBP-1c proteins bearing wild type sequences (WT) or sequences containing alanine substitutions at serines 265 and 266 (S265/266A), alanine substitution at serine 329 (S329A), or alanine substitutions at all three serine residues depicted above (3A). An in vitro kinase assay revealed that SIK1 could indeed phosphorylate wild type nSREBP-1c. Although mutations at serines 265 and 266 affect the phosphorylation of SREBP-1c by SIK1 modestly, S329A mutant is strongly refractory to SIK-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting that the serine 329 residue is one of major target sites for SIK-mediated phosphorylation of SREBP-1c (Fig. 3B). Mutations at all three serine residues almost completely block SIK-mediated phosphorylation of nSREBP-1c, suggesting that the three sites represent major regulatory targets for SIK kinases. Triple Mutant SREBP-1c Is Refractory to SIK-dependent Inhibition—To further confirm the importance of serine residues of SREBP-1c on SIK-mediated inhibition, we generated expression vectors for nSREBP-1c wild type, S265A/S266A, S329A, and S265A/S266A/S329A and performed co-transfection experiments with a Fasn Luc reporter plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4A, SIK1 overexpression effectively reduces Fasn Luc activity driven by WT or S265A/S266A nSREBP-1c expression. However, S329A is largely refractory to SIK1-mediated inhibition, and S265A/S266A/S329A mutant nSREBP-1c is almost completely unaffected by SIK1 expression. These data suggest that indeed serine 329 of SREBP-1c represents a major target for SIK-mediated regulation of lipogenic gene expression, with a contribution from other serine residues, such as serine 265 and 266, within the b/HLH/LZ domain. Similar results were obtained in experiments using either adiponectin or constitutively active AMPK expression vector, suggesting that these two pathways indeed share a similar regulatory mechanism (Fig. 4B). To further verify the importance of these three serine residues of SREBP-1c, we generated adenoviruses for nSREBP-1c WT and S265A/S266A/S329A and tested in primary hepatocytes. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, SIK1-mediated inhibition of either Ad Fasn Luc reporter activity or endogenous Fasn gene expression is blocked by S265A/S266A/S329A expression but not by WT expression, confirming that SIK-dependent regulation of lipogenesis could be achieved via phosphorylation of three major serine residues of SREBP-1c identified. To understand the molecular mechanism by which SIK-mediated serine phosphorylation affects SREBP-1c transcriptional activity, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 5C, binding of WT nSREBP-1c on the Fasn promoter is partially blocked by SIK1 overexpression in primary hepatocytes, suggesting that the phosphorylation at three serine residues within the b/HLH/LZ domain by SIK1 may inhibit the DNA binding and/or dimerization potential of SREBP-1c. In accordance with this idea, S265A/S266A/S329A mutant nSREBP-1c remains on the Fasn promoter even with SIK1 overexpression. Interestingly, SIK1 does not alter the stability or the cellular localization of nSREBP-1c in primary hepatocytes (data not shown), suggesting that the phosphorylation status of serines 265, 266, and 329 of SREBP-1c may only affect its DNA binding activity.FIGURE 5Triple mutant SREBP-1c is refractory to SIK-mediated regulation of hepatic lipogenesis.

We thus injected adenovirus for GFP alone, SIK1 alone, or SIK1 plus S265A/S266A/S329A mutant SREBP-1c into the tail veins of mice. Indeed, overexpression of SIK1 greatly reduces blood glucose levels, as reported previously (data not shown) (33Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature.. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Google Scholar). Furthermore, SIK1-injected mice display significant reduction in hepatic TAG levels and lipogenic gene expression compared with GFP control mice, showing that indeed SIK could regulate hepatic lipogenesis in vivo. The effect of SIK1 overexpression is almost completely blocked by co-infection of S265A/S266A/S329A mutant SREBP-1c. Hepatic expression of Fasn, Scd1 (stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1), or Thrsp is significantly higher with Ad-S265A/S266A/S329A plus Ad-SIK-injected mice compared with mice injected with SIK1 adenovirus alone (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, SIK-mediated reduction of FAS protein levels is partially restored by Ad-S265A/S266A/S329A nSREBP-1c co-infection, and reduction in hepatic TAG levels is also restored with co-injection of S265A/S266A/S329A and SIK1 adenoviruses (Fig. 6, B and C). These data clearly indicate that SIK-mediated regulation of hepatic lipogenesis is indeed targeted via the phosphorylation of serine 329 and/or 265/266 of SREBP-1c. As reported previously, SIK expression greatly reduces gluconeogenic gene expression and plasma glucose level via the regulation of CRTC2 phosphorylation (33Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature.. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Google Scholar). Although the expression of S265A/S266A/S329A mutant nSREBP-1c restores SIK-mediated repression of hepatic lipogenesis, plasma glucose levels remains significantly lower with Ad-SIK plus S265A/S266A/S329A-injected mice compared with GFP control mice (data not shown). Rather, S265A/S266A/S329A co-expression with SIK1 further reduces hepatic mRNAs for cytosolic Pck1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1) or G6pc (Fig. 6D), in accordance with a notion that SREBP-1c might be involved in the transcriptional inhibition of gluconeogenic genes (39Chakravarty K. Leahy P. Becard D. Hakimi P. Foretz M. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 34816-34823Google Scholar). These data further suggest that SIK-mediated regulation of SREBP-1c and lipogenesis is distinct from that of CRTC2 and hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression. SREBPs are the major regulators for lipid homeostasis in mammals (17Sun L.P. Seemann J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2007; 104: 6519-6526Google Scholar, 18Brown A.J.

Among family members, SREBP-2 is known to regulate cholesterol uptake or biosynthesis in liver by controlling expression of genes involved in the pathway such as Ldlr, Hmgcs1, Hmgcr (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), and Fdps, whereas SREBP-1c selectively activates transcription of genes such as Fasn, Acaca, or Scd1 in the fatty acid biosynthetic program. The regulatory mechanisms for these two factors show considerable differences. Although SREBP-2 expression is not regulated by sterols, its processing is tightly regulated by intracellular levels of sterols, showing a case of end product-mediated inhibition. On the other hand, SREBP-1c is mainly regulated at the level of transcription by insulin, although it was suggested that its activity is also enhanced in the presence of insulin in some cell types. Interestingly, oxysterol-sensing transcription factor LXR is shown to be involved in the transcriptional activation of SREBP-1c, suggesting that two SREBP factors might not be active simultaneously in some physiological conditions. Here we suggest another layer of regulatory mechanisms for differential modulation of two SREBPs by SIK kinases, by showing that SIKs can only specifically shut down fatty acid biosynthetic pathways over cholesterol metabolism via the phosphorylation of SREBP-1c. Recent studies revealed potential involvement of various kinase pathways to regulate SREBP-1c activity. In a study conducted in HepG2 hepatoma cell lines, protein kinase A was shown to affect DNA binding ability of SREBP-1a by its phosphorylation of serine 338, which corresponds to serine 265 of SREBP-1c (31Lu M. Shyy J.Y. Am. J. Physiol... 2006; 290: C1477-C1486Google Scholar), although modification of this site alone by SIK might not be critical in the regulation of SREBP proteins based on our results. According to a report by Bengoechea and Ericsson (40Bengoechea-Alonso M.T. Ericsson J. J. Biol. Chem... 2009; 284: 5885-5895Google Scholar), another serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase was also shown to be involved in the down-regulation of SREBP-1 activity. Unlike the regulatory mechanisms by protein kinase A or SIK, GSK3 targets sequences that are C terminal to the b/HLH/LZ domain and promotes ubiquitin ligase Fbw7-dependent degradation of SREBP-1 proteins. The implication of multiple kinases for the regulation of SREBP-1 would underscore its importance in the regulation of hepatic lipogenesis. AMPK has long been implicated in the regulation of hepatic fatty acid biosynthetic pathway via transcriptional mechanisms. Although not shown unswervingly, it is thought to target SREBP-1c directly to modulate entire lipogenic programs. As AMPK-related kinases, SIKs share similar substrate recognition sequences with AMPK as in the case of serine 171 phosphorylation of CRTC2. In our hands, among three potential AMPK/SIK target sequences in SREBP-1c, serine 329, together with serine 265/266 within the b/HLH/LZ domain, is shown to be critical in the SIK-mediated regulation. Indeed, the inhibitory effects of AMPK or adiponectin on SREBP-mediated Fasn promoter activity are also blocked by S329A mutation of SREBP-1c (Fig. 4B), suggesting that two kinases would similarly target specific sequences of SREBP-1c to regulate hepatic fatty acid biosynthesis. As shown previously, effects of adiponectin may selectively activate the AMPK pathway, since SIK1 or SIK2 knockdown in primary hepatocytes did not alter adiponectin-dependent down-regulation of lipogenic gene expression (data not shown). What could be the logical explanation for the presence of multiple kinases to regulate the same pathway? One would suspect that the existence of seemingly redundant kinase functions for regulating hepatic lipogenesis in mammals might accentuate the importance of tight regulation of lipid homeostasis. Alternatively, previously identified roles of AMPK in the regulation of hepatic energy metabolism might be indeed assumed in part by other related kinases, including SIK proteins, since most conclusions were drawn from studies utilizing the pharmacological activation of AMPK, systemic knock-out of AMPK α subunits in mice, or transgenic expression of constitutively active AMPK in the liver (for reviews, see Refs. 41Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab... 2005; 1: 15-25Google Scholar and 42Xue B. Kahn B.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.).. 2006; 574: 73-83Google Scholar). Furthermore, AMPK would function to regulate various metabolic pathways not only in peripheral organs but also in the hypothalamus in the brain, making it even harder to gauge the hepatocyte-specific role of AMPK. In our current studies, we were able to observe increased hepatic lipogenic gene expression with SIK1 knockdown (Fig. 1B), suggesting that indeed SIK1 is critical in the regulation of endogenous fatty acid synthetic gene expression. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is now regarded as a critical pathogenic condition that leads to severe metabolic diseases, including diabetes or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (25Angulo P. N. Engl. J. Med... 2002; 346: 1221-1231Google Scholar, 26Browning J.D. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Invest... 2004; 114: 147-152Google Scholar). Hepatic de novo lipogenesis, together with expression of genes in the pathway, was shown to be enhanced in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients (27Kohjima M. Higuchi N. Kato M. Kotoh K.

Hepatol. Res... 2008; 38: 1122-1129Google Scholar). As a master regulator of fatty acid biosynthesis in liver, SREBP-1c was suggested to be involved in the development of this disease by contributing to the onset of fatty liver phenotypes. In our current study, we were able to identify the molecular mechanism by which SIK kinases can regulate hepatic TAG levels via the phosphorylation of serine 329 and serine 265/266 of SREBP-1c. Our results propose that modulation of SREBP-1c activity via the SIK pathway could be an attractive approach to relieve such symptoms. Pharmacological activation of SIK activity might be beneficial to deter the development of severe hepatic diseases.

Clinically, this results in limited options for antiretroviral therapy and accelerated rates of liver disease, causing liver disease to be the second leading cause of death for HIV infected patients. The mechanisms causing this propensity for liver dysfunction during HIV remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate that HIV and/or the HIV glycoprotein gp120 ligation of CXCR4 on hepatocytes selectively up-regulates TRAIL R2 expression and confers an acquired sensitivity to TRAIL mediated apoptosis which is mediated by JNK II, but not p38 nor G-proteins. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that HIV infection renders hepatocytes more susceptible to liver injury during disease states associated with enhanced TRAIL production such as HBV, HCV, or steatohepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W2026495431,"WNK kinases are serine-threonine kinases with an atypical placement of the catalytic lysine. WNK1, the first member discovered, has multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, including a ubiquitously expressed full-length long form (L-WNK1) and a kidney-specific form (KS-WNK1) predominantly expressed in the kidney. Intronic deletions of WNK1 that increase WNK1 transcript cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2, an autosomal-dominant disease characterized by hypertension and hyperkalemia. L-WNK1 inhibits renal K+ channel ROMK, likely contributing to hyperkalemia in PHAII. Previously, we reported that KS-WNK1 by itself has no effect on ROMK1 but antagonizes L-WNK1-mediated inhibition of ROMK1. Amino acids 1–253 of KS-WNK1 (KS-WNK1(1–253)) are sufficient for reversing the inhibition of ROMK1 caused by L-WNK1(1–491). Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which KS-WNK1 counteracts L-WNK1 regulation of ROMK1. We reported that two regions of KS-WNK1(1–253) are involved in the antagonism of L-WNK1; one includes the first 30 amino acids unique for KS-WNK1 encoded by the alternatively spliced initiating exon 4A, and the other is equivalent to the autoinhibitory domain (AID) of L-WNK1. Mutations of two phenylalanine residues known to be critical for autoinhibitory function of AID abolish the ability of the AID region of KS-WNK1 to antagonize L-WNK1. To examine the physiological role of KS-WNK1 in the regulation of renal K+ secretion, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress amino acids 1–253 of KS-WNK1 under the control of a kidney-specific promoter. Transgenic mice have lower serum K+ levels and higher urinary fractional excretion of K+ compared with wild type littermates despite the same amount of daily urinary K+ excretion. Moreover, transgenic mice (compared with wild type littermates) displayed a higher abundance of ROMK on the apical membrane of distal nephron.

Beyond these conserved domains and motifs, amino acid sequences of WNK1–4 are divergent. The human WNK1 gene spans more than 150 kb in chromosome 12 and consists of 28 exons (3Wilson F.H. Disse-Nicodème S. Choate K.A. Ishikawa K. Nelson-Williams C. Desitter I. Gunel M. Milford D.V. Lipkin G.W. Achard J.M. Feely M.P. Dussol B. Berland Y. Unwin R.J. Mayan H. Simon D.B. Farfel Z.

A WNK1 transcript produced from all 28 exons (encodes a peptide referred to herein as long WNK1 (L-WNK1)) is ubiquitously expressed (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J.

A shorter WNK1 transcript produced by an alternative 5′ exon (exon 4A) and exon 5–28 is expressed exclusively in the kidney, encoding a peptide known as kidney-specific WNK1 (KS-WNK1) (4Delaloy C.

The first 30 amino acids of KS-WNK1 are encoded by exon 4A (4Delaloy C. Lu J. Houot A.M. Disse-Nicodeme S. Gasc J.M. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. Mol. Cell.

In the kidney, KS-WNK1 is predominantly in the distal convoluted tubule, the connecting tubule, and the cortical collecting duct (6O'Reilly M. Marshall E. Macgillivray T. Mittal M. Xue W. Kenyon C.J. Brown R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2402-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in these segments. Analysis by real time PCR reveals that the transcript for KS-WNK1 in kidney is more abundant than that for L-WNK1 (4Delaloy C. Lu J. Houot A.M. Disse-Nicodeme S. Gasc J.M. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X.

Alternative splicing of exon 11 and 12 also occurs and produces isoforms with peptide length between that of L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 and with differential tissue distributions (4Delaloy C. Lu J.

Large deletions within the first intron of WNK1 increase the abundance of WNK1 transcript and cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHAII; also known as familial hyperkalemic hypertension or Gordon syndrome), an autosomal-dominant disorder featured by hypertension and hyperkalemia (3Wilson F.H.

With respect to WNK1 on K+ transport, it was reported that L-WNK1 decreases cell surface abundance of renal K+ channel ROMK1 (renal outer medullary potassium (K) channel 1) by increasing clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis of the channel (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13He G. Wang H.R. Huang S.K. Huang C.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ROMK K+ channels are expressed in the connecting tubule and the cortical collecting duct and are important for base-line (non-flow-stimulated) renal K+ secretion (14Hebert S.C. Desir G. Giebisch G. Wang W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 319-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, a decrease in K+ secretion by the kidney resulting from the inhibition of ROMK by L-WNK1 may contribute to hyperkalemia in patients of PHAII with WNK1 mutations. However, there are multiple alternatively spliced WNK1 isoforms differentially expressed in tissues (4Delaloy C. Lu J. Houot A.M. Disse-Nicodeme S. Gasc J.M. Corvol P. Jeunemaitre X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9208-9221Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 5O'Reilly M. Marshall E. Speirs H.J. Brown R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The effects of deletions of the first intron on splice variants of WNK1 and the effects of individual isoforms on K+ transport remain largely unknown. Recently, we and others reported that kidney-specific WNK1, by itself, has no effect on ROMK1 but antagonizes the inhibition of ROMK1 caused by L-WNK1 (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Wade J.B. Fang L. Liu J. Li D. Yang C.L. Subramanya A.R. Maouyo D. Mason A. Ellison D.H. Welling P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8558-8563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). K+ secretion by kidney is critical for controlling serum K+ levels and overall K+ homeostasis (14Hebert S.C. Desir G. Giebisch G. Wang W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 319-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As an important pathway for K+ secretion in kidney, the abundance of ROMK on the apical membrane of distal nephron is regulated by dietary K+ intake (14Hebert S.C. Desir G. Giebisch G. Wang W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 319-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The apical ROMK abundance decreases or increases during low or high dietary K+ intake, respectively (16Palmer L.G. Frindt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F805-F812PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang W.-H. Lerea K.M. Chan M. Giebisch G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F165-F172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in the apical abundance of ROMK in response to dietary K+ restriction involves an increase in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation of the channel protein (18Zeng W.Z. Babich V. Ortega B. Quigley R. White S.J. Welling P.A. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F630-F639Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Chu P.Y. Quigley R. Babich V. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1179-F1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We reported that dietary K+ restriction in rats increases the expression of L-WNK1 and decreases that of KS-WNK1 (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The increase in the L-WNK1 to KS-WNK1 ratio would be expected to cause inhibition of ROMK1. These results suggest that KS-WNK1 is an important physiological antagonist of L-WNK1, and the ratio of L-WNK1 to KS-WNK1 regulates surface abundance of ROMK1 and renal K+ secretion during changes in dietary K+ intake. In the present study, we further examined the mechanism by which KS-WNK1 antagonizes L-WNK1 regulation of ROMK1. We identified two regions within amino acids 1–253 of KS-WNK1 that are involved in binding to and antagonism of L-WNK1. Furthermore, to examine the physiological role of KS-WNK1 in the regulation of K+ secretion in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing amino acids 1–253 of KS-WNK1 and found that they display lower serum K+ levels and increased tubular excretion of K+ relative to wild type littermates despite a similar K+ intake. These results further support the important physiological role of KS-WNK1 in the regulation ROMK1 activity and renal K+ excretion. Plasmid DNA Constructs—pEGFP-ROMK1, pCMV-Myc-WNK1(1–491), and pIRES-FLAG-KS-WNK1(1–253) were described previously (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). WNK1 fragments were amplified by PCR using rat WNK1 cDNA as the template and subcloned into a pCMV5-Myc vector. Fragments of rat KS-WNK1 were amplified by PCR and subcloned into a carboxyl-terminal FLAG vector (pIRES-hrGFP-1a) (Stratagene). Point mutations were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit; Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—HEK 293 cells were cultured, transfected, and harvested as described previously (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation, the proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by using monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:100 dilution; Sigma) and followed by protein A-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were washed three time with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100. For Western blot analysis, total lysates, immunoprecipitates, or kidney homogenate were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Whole Cell Patch-Clamp Recording of ROMK1 Channels—HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding GFP-ROMK1 and a fragment of L-WNK1 and/or KS-WNK1. In each experiment, the total amount of DNA for transfection was balanced by using empty vectors. Approximately 36–48 h after transfection, whole cell currents were recorded by using an Axopatch 200B amplifier as previous described (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were identified by using epifluorescent microscopy. The bath and pipette solution contained 145 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 145 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), respectively. Capacitance and access resistance were monitored and 75% compensated. The voltage protocol consists of 0-mV holding potential and 400-ms steps from -100 to 100 mV in 20-mV increments. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The FLAG-KS-WNK1(1–253) fusion fragment was generated by PCR using plasmid pIRES-hrGFP-KS-WNK1(1–253) as template. The ∼0.8-kb restriction fragment was isolated and cloned into unique SbfI and SmaI sites downstream to the Ksp-cadherin promoter of pKsp-BGH plasmid (provided by Dr. Peter Igarashi, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). The plasmid insert was verified by DNA sequencing. The ∼2.6-kb transgene fragment Ksp-FLAG-KS-WNK1(1–253) was isolated by digestion with NdeI and KpnI followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, electroelution, and purification by anion exchange chromatography (Elutip-d, NH). Purified DNA was concentrated in Microcon 30 filters (Millipore, MA), resuspended at a concentration of 80 ng/μl in microinjection buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.25 mm EDTA), and sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm filters. Transgene DNA was microinjected into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes by standard pronuclear injection. Fertilized oocytes were from C57BL/6 crosses. Microinjection was performed by the University of Texas Southwestern Transgenic Mouse Core Facility. The microinjected embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant foster mothers and were permitted to develop to term. Genotyping of Transgenic Mice—Founder (G0) mice were identified by PCR analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from tails of transgenic mice using a standard method. Two pairs of primers were used for genotyping by PCR. One is specific for endogenous mouse WNK1 (forward, 5′-AAA ATA CTC TGT CAG GCT TAA GTG T-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGA AGC CAG GCA TTA AGC ACT C-3′), which would produce a 266-bp fragment in both wild type and transgenic mice. The other is specific for transgenic fragment (forward, 5′-GCA GAT CAG CAT CAA CAG CTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAA TGC GAT GCA ATT TCC TC-3′), which would produce a 320-bp fragment only in transgenic mice. The condition for PCR includes 35 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose gels. Quantitative Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from whole kidney with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression by quantitative real time PCR was carried out on ABI 7000 as described in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin no. 2 using the TagMan assay. Primer from exon 4A (RP forward, 5′-GCT GCT GTT CTC AAA AGG ATT GTA T-3′), from exon 5 (RP reverse, 5′-CAG GAA TTG CTA CTT TGT CAA AAC TG-3′), and from TagMan probe (5′-TGA GGG AGT GAA GCC A-3′) were used to amplify the kidney-specific isoform (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Relative KS-WNK1 mRNA levels were calculated with 18 S rRNA as the internal control. Kidney cDNA was prepared from three to five animals as described above, and each sample was assayed in triplicate. Immunofluorescent Staining—The mice were anesthetized by Avertin and perfused via the heart with 15 ml of PBS followed by 15 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The kidneys were harvested and postfixed for 4 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C, dehydrated by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C, and mounted in OTC (Tissue-Tek) for sectioning. The sections (4–5-μm thickness) were stained with primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:300, Sigma) or anti-ROMK (1:1000), followed by secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500). The fluorescent images were obtained using Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope as described (19Chu P.Y. Quigley R. Babich V. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1179-F1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Blood and Urine Measurements—Under anesthesia by Avertin, blood was drawn from mice by retro-orbital bleeding into heparinized tubes. Electrolytes were measured using a flame photometer. Creatinine was measured by capillary electrophoresis (P/ACE MDQ; Beckman Coulter). Spot urine samples were collected by catching spontaneous voids. 24-h urine samples were collected using metabolic cages (Hatteras Instruments). All of the experiments involving animals were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and were approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons between two groups of data were made using two-tailed unpaired Student's t tests. Multiple comparison were made using one-way analysis of variance followed by two-tailed Student's t tests adjusted for multiple comparisons. p values less than 0.05 and 0.01 were considered significant for single and multiple comparisons, respectively. Experiments shown in each panel of the figures were repeated at least three times with similar results. Two Regions of KS-WNK1(1–253) Are Involved in the Antagonism of L-WNK1—We have reported that KS-WNK1(1–253) antagonizes inhibition of ROMK1 by L-WNK1 by binding to amino acids 1–491 of L-WNK1 (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To further define the molecular determinant(s) of KS-WNK1 involved in antagonism of L-WNK1 regulation of ROMK1, we generated several overlapping and nonoverlapping smaller fragments of KS-WNK1(1–253) and examined their effects on WNK1(1–491)-mediated inhibition of ROMK1. These fragments of KS-WNK1 include amino acids 1–196, 1–137, 1–77, and 31–253, respectively (Fig. 1A). To examine the effects of these fragments on antagonism of L-WNK1 regulation of ROMK1, HEK cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ROMK1, WNK1(1–491) and one each of KS-WNK1 fragment and recorded for ROMK1 current density using whole cell patch-clamp recording. We have shown that WNK1(1–491) fully recapitulates the effect of full-length L-WNK1 on ROMK1 (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13He G. Wang H.R. Huang S.K. Huang C.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, we confirmed that WNK1(1–491) inhibits ROMK1 (compare bars 1 and 2) and that KS-WNK1(1–253) reverses WNK1(1–491)-mediated inhibition of ROMK1 (bar 3) as reported previously by us (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Expression of KS-WNK1(1–253) exerts no effect on ROMK1 in the absence of WNK1(1–491) (not shown in Fig. 1B; see Ref. 12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here, we found that each of the smaller KS-WNK1 constructs generated could reverse the inhibition of ROMK1 caused by WNK1(1–491) (Fig. 1B, bars 4–7). WNK1 contains an AID just carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain that is conserved in WNKs across species (1Xu B. English J.M. Wilsbacher J.L. Stippec S. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16795-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20Xu B.E. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The AID domain binds with and suppresses the activity of the kinase domain (20Xu B.E. Min X. Stippec S. Lee B.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48456-48462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that AID domain of WNK1 can antagonize WNK1(1–491)-mediated inhibition of ROMK1 (12Lazrak A. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Wang H.R. Liu Z. Huang C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 295: F438-F445Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because KS-WNK1(1–253), KS-WNK1(1–196), KS-WNK1(1–137), and KS-WNK1(31–253) each contain the AID domain, it is not surprising that they each can reverse the effect of WNK1(1–491). The ability of KS-WNK1(1–77) to reverse the inhibition of ROMK1 by WNK1(1–491), however, is unexpected and suggests that additional region is involved in interacting with and reversing the effect of WNK1(1–491). KS-WNK1(1–77) contains the unique 30 amino acids encoded by exon 4A. We hypothesized that this region encoded by exon 4A is responsible for reversal of WNK1(1–491)-mediated inhibition of ROMK1 by KS-WNK1(1–77). In this hypothesis, the two regions within KS-WNK1(1–253) (i.e. AID and region encoded by exon 4A) can interact with WNK1(1–491) independently of one another to reverse the effect of WNK1(1–491). To test this hypothesis, we examined the interaction between WNK(1–491) and KS-WNK1(1–253), KS-WNK1(1–77) or KS-WNK1(31–253) by coimmunoprecipitation. HEK cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged WNK1(1–491) and each of FLAG-tagged KS-WNK1 fragments as indicated. As shown in Fig. 1C (bottom panel), anti-FLAG antibody immunoprecipitated FLAG-KS-WNK1(1–77), KS-WNK1(31–253), and KS-WNK1(1–253) (lanes 2–4 indicated by 10-, 29-, and 32-kDa protein bands, respectively). The higher molecular size band (∼160-kDa protein band) in lysates of cells expressing KS-WNK1(1–77) (Fig. 1C, lane 2) suggests that KS-WNK1(1–77) may form oligomers. However, we did not observe large molecular size bands for KS-WNK1(1–253) expressed in HEK cells (not shown) nor in transgenic mice (see “Results” below), suggesting that oligomerization of KS-WNK1 does not occur in vivo and thus is not physiologically important. As shown, Myc-WNK1(1–491) (indicated by the 60-kDa protein band in the middle panel of Fig. 1C) coimmunoprecipitated strongly with KS-WNK1(1–253) (Fig. 1C, lane 4) and to a lesser degree with KS-WNK1(1–77) and with KS-WNK1(31–253) (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). As a control, Myc-WNK1(1–491) did not coimmunoprecipitate with FLAG-tagged pod (Fig. 1C, lane 5), an unrelated transcription factor protein (22Quaggin S.E. Schwartz L. Cui S. Igarashi P. Deimling J. Post M. Rossant J. Development. 1999; 126: 5771-5783PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of input Myc-WNK1(1–491) was not different among experimental groups (Fig. 1C, top panel). These results support the hypothesis that the region encoded by exon 4A (as in “KS-WNK1(1–77)”) and the AID domain (as in “KS-WNK1(31–253)”) can interact with WNK1(1–491), independently. Consistently, the interaction with WNK1(1–491) is stronger for KS-WNK1(1–253), which contains both regions. It should be noted that the relatively weaker interaction between WNK1(1–491) and KS-WNK1(1–77) or KS-WNK1(31–253) was sufficient for reversing the inhibitory effect of WNK1(1–491) (Fig. 1B).

Its three known members, ASPP1, ASPP2, and iASPP, were previously found to interact with p53, influencing the apoptotic response of cells without affecting p53-induced cell cycle arrest. More specifically, the bona fide tumor suppressors, ASPP1 and ASPP2, bind to the core domain of p53 and stimulate transcription of apoptotic genes, whereas oncogenic iASPP also binds to the p53 core domain but inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Although the general interaction regions are known, details of the interfaces for each p53-ASPP complex have not been evaluated. We undertook a comprehensive biophysical characterization of ASPP-p53 complex formation and mapped the binding interfaces by NMR. We found that the interaction interface on p53 for the proapoptotic protein ASPP2 is distinct from that for the antiapoptotic iASPP. ASPP2 primarily binds to the core domain of p53, whereas iASPP predominantly interacts with a linker region adjacent to the core domain. Our detailed structural analyses of the ASPP-p53 interactions provide insight into the structural basis of the differential behavior of pro- and antiapoptotic ASPP family members. p53-dependent apoptosis is modulated by the ASPP family of proteins (apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53; also called ankyrin repeat-, Src homology 3 domain-, and Pro-rich region-containing proteins).

Since the discovery of p53 in 1979 (1Lane D.P. Crawford L.V. Nature. 1979; 278: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 2Linzer D.I. Levine A.J.

For example, control of cellular fate by p53 through cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis (or vice versa) is still a topic of debate, and several types of p53 involvement and modulation have been described (8Balint E.E. Vousden K.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 9Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 10Haupt S.

An early clue that these two cellular responses can be separated emerged from studies characterizing p53 mutants that were defective in their ability to induce apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest (13Ludwig R.L.

Since these initial reports, post-translational modifications of p53 and interactions with specific cellular proteins have been found to be more closely associated with one pathway over the other. For example, phosphorylation of Ser46 (16Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y.

Proteins that bind p53 have also been implicated in promoting p53-dependent apoptosis (21Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T.

The ASPP proteins constitute a recently described new family of proteins that bind and modulate p53-dependent apoptosis (23Trigiante G. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Their name is based on the domain organization of the proteins (ankyrin repeat, SH3, 3The abbreviations used are: SH3, Src homology 3; ASPP2-CT, the C terminus of ASPP2; p53-CD, the DNA-binding core domain of p53; iASPP-CT, the C terminus of iASPP; p53-PCD, the Pro-rich and DNA-binding core domains of p53; p53-PCD2F, p53-PCD with W91F and W146F; p53-PCD2F-L, p53-PCD2F with linker; p53-PCD2F-L-OD, p53-PCD2F-L with oligomerization domain; p53-PCD2F-L-OD-BD, p53-PCD2F-L-OD with basic domain; p53-L, p53 linker between CD and OD; p53-L-OD-BD, p53 linker, oligomerization and basic domain; TEV, tobacco etch virus; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; TROSY, transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy; OD, oligomerization domain; BD, basic domain. and proline-rich domain-containing protein) as well as their function (apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53). The founding member of the family, ASPP2, was initially identified as 53BP2 (p53-binding protein 2) in a yeast two-hybrid screen, using the p53 DNA binding core domain as bait (24Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). ASPP1 was identified later in a homology search (25Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Functional studies revealed that p53-induced apoptosis was substantially enhanced in the presence of ASPP1 or ASPP2 (26Lopez C.D. Ao Y. Rohde L.H. Perez T.D. O'Connor D.J. Lu X. Ford J.M.

O'Connor D.J. Bergamaschi D. Trigiante G. Hsieh J.K. Zhong S. Campargue I. Naumovski L. Crook T. Lu X. Mol.

Gasco M. Crook T. Lu X. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Such preferential activation of apoptosis by ASPP1/2 was also observed for p63 and p73 (30Bergamaschi D. Samuels Y. Jin B. Duraisingham S. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The third member of ASPP family, iASPP, was originally identified as an inhibitor of NFκB (31Yang J.P. Hori M. Sanda T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15662-15670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Compared with ASPP1/2, iASPP inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. Given the high sequence similarity between all three proteins, it may be possible that iASPP simply functions as a competitive inhibitor of ASPP1/2. However, iASPP specifically inhibits p53-dependent induction of proapoptotic genes (29Bergamaschi D. Samuels Y. Sullivan A. Zvelebil M. Breyssens H. Bisso A. Del Sal G. Syed N. Smith P. Gasco M. Crook T. Lu X. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 32Bergamaschi D. Samuels Y. O'Neil N.J. Trigiante G. Crook T. Hsieh J.K. O'Connor D.J. Zhong S. Campargue I. Tomlinson M.L. Kuwabara P.E. Lu X. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism of inhibition that involves iASPP altering the promoter binding activity of p53. The regions of ASPPs that interact with p53 have been mapped to the C termini, consisting of four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain (Fig. 1, A and B). The crystal structure of the complex between the C terminus of ASPP2 (ASPP2-CT) and the DNA binding core domain of p53 (p53-CD; Fig. 1C) reveals that the third and fourth ankyrin repeats and SH3 domain of ASPP2 contact the same p53-CD surface that interfaces with DNA (33Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the C-terminal region of iASPP (iASPP-CT) shows a very similar structure, and binding of iASPP-CT and ASPP2-CT to p53-CD exhibits comparable affinities (34Robinson R.A. Lu X. Jones E.Y. Siebold C. Structure. 2008; 16: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the opposing functional outcomes of ASPP2 and iASPP interactions, we investigated whether the detailed molecular interactions of these two proteins with p53 are distinct. Here, we report on biochemical and structural studies of ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT with various constructs of p53 (Fig. 1C). ASPP-CT binding to p53 that contains the Pro-rich and DNA-binding core domains (p53-PCD) was followed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), fluorescence, and NMR methods. Our results show that both ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT utilize very similar interaction surfaces to contact p53-PCD. However, in stark contrast to previous reports, we found that ASPP2-CT binds to p53-PCD much more tightly than iASPP-CT (∼60-fold). Extension of these binding studies to several p53 constructs (Fig. 1C) revealed that iASPP-CT and ASPP2-CT exhibit different affinities, suggesting that the molecular interaction determinants are unique to the individual complexes. Although the core domain of p53 is the primary binding target for ASPP2-CT, we found that the p53 linker region is the highest affinity target for iASPP-CT. Therefore, different regions of p53 appear to contribute to the proapopototic and antiapoptotic complexes, respectively, allowing modulation of the functional outcome. Detailed knowledge of the differential interfaces in the ASPP2-p53 and iASPP-p53 complexes will aid in the design of small therapeutic molecules that specifically target either of the two interactions. Protein Expression and Purification—cDNAs encoding human p53 and ASPP2 were purchased from Invitrogen. Constructs coding for residues 56-289 (p53-PCD), 56-322 (p53-PCD-L), 56-362 (p53-PCD-L-OD), 289-322 (p53-L), 289-393 (p53-L-OD-BD), and 56-393 (p53-PCD-L-OD-BD) of p53 (Fig. 1C) were amplified and subcloned into pET21a (EMD Chemicals, Inc., San Diego, CA) using NdeI and XhoI sites. The final protein products included an N-terminal Met and Leu-Glu-His6 at their C termini. Gene constructs coding for residues 289-322 of p53 (p53-L), 925-1128 of ASPP2 (ASPP2-CT), and 623-828 of iASPP (iASPP-CT) were amplified and subcloned into pET32a (EMD Chemicals) using EcoRI and XhoI sites. A TEV protease recognition sequence (ENLYFQS) was created between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pET32, at the C terminus of thioredoxin. Final ASPP proteins, after TEV protease cleavage, contained Ser-Glu-Phe and Leu-Glu-His6 at their N termini and C termini, respectively. p53-L only possessed the three extra residues (Ser-Glu-Phe) at the N terminus. All p53 mutant constructs, p53-PCD-W91F/W146F, p53-PCD-L-OD-W91F/W146F, p53-PCD-L-OD-BD-W91F/W146F, p53-PCD-L-OD-BD-W91F/W146F/L344R, and p53-PCD-L-OD-BD-W91F/W146F/L344P (Fig. 1C), were created using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Nucleotide sequences were verified for the entire coding regions of all constructs. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3), cultured in Luria-Bertani medium, using 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction and growth at 18 °C for 16 h. Soluble forms of His-tagged proteins were first purified using 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns, and aggregated material was removed by gel filtration column chromatography using Hi-Load Superdex200 16/60 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% sodium azide. The thioredoxin portions of the fusion proteins were cleaved from p53-L, ASPP2-CT, and iASPP-CT by incubating with TEV protease (ratio of 20:1) overnight at 4 °C. The expression plasmid PRK709 for TEV protease was obtained from Addgene Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and TEV protease was purified as described by Nallamsetty et al. (35Nallamsetty S. Kapust R.B. Tozser J. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Copel T.D. Waugh D.S. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 38: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All final purifications of p53 proteins were performed over a Hi-Trap SP column (GE Healthcare) at pH 6.5 using a 0-1 m NaCl gradient. ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT were purified over a Hi-Trap QP column (GE Healthcare) at pH 7.5 and a 0-1 m NaCl gradient. Buffer exchange was carried out using Amicon concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and proteins were stored at 4 °C in solution or as lyophilized powders at -80 °C. The p53-L peptides were purified over a C4 reverse phase column using an acetonitrile (5-80%) gradient with 0.1% formic acid. For isotopic labeling, proteins were expressed in modified minimal medium using 15NH4Cl and [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C6, 2H7]-glucose as sole nitrogen and/or carbon sources, respectively. For deuterium labeling, growth media were prepared with 99.9% 2H2O. U-13C,15N,2H-Labeled proteins with selective Val/Leu-methyl and Phe/Tyr-12C,1H-protonation were prepared as described for the isotopic labeling above, except that U-13C5,15N,2H2(2,3)-labeled valine and/or unlabeled tyrosine and phenylalanine were added prior to induction (36Rosen M.K.

The molecular masses of all purified proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry, and isotope labeling efficiency was estimated to be greater than 98% for all labeled proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using theoretical extinction coefficients based on amino acid sequences using the ExPASy Proteomics Server (available on the World Wide Web). The concentration of p53-L was determined by amino acid analysis. ITC—Typically, p53 protein or ASPP2-CT, at concentrations of 20-40 μm, stirred at 307 rpm in the sample cell, were titrated with aliquots of 240-400 μm solutions of ASPP2-CT or p53 at 12 °C in the calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). Titrations were carried out in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% sodium azide with varying amounts of NaCl (50-150 mm). In some titrations, 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, was replaced by 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. All samples were extensively buffer-exchanged using Amicon concentrators (Millipore) prior to the titrations. 10-μl aliquots were used for injections (the first injection was 3 μl) at 250-s intervals (initial delay, 60 s). Titrations into the buffers were used for base-line corrections. Data analyses were performed using Origin 7 software (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were conducted at 17 °C using protein samples in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 50 or 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% sodium azide, using Bruker Avance 900-, 800-, 700-, and 600-MHz spectrometers, equipped with 5-mm, triple resonance and z axis gradient cryoprobes. For backbone chemical shift assignments of ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, and three-dimensional HNCACB and HN(CO)CACB experiments were performed on U-13C,15N,2H-labeled proteins or U-13C,15N,2H-labeled ones with selective Val/Ile/Leu-13C1H3 - and Phe/Tyr-12C,1H-protonation. Binding site mapping and ligand titration studies were conducted using 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC experiments on U-15N,2H- or U-13C,15N,2H-labeled samples after adding aliquots of unlabeled partner protein. A total of 5-8 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra were acquired for each titration. Titration curves were plotted for five TROSY-HSQC resonances that exhibited reasonable shifts and no peak overlap or broadening. Dissociation constants were calculated by nonlinear best fitting the 1HN titration curves using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), averaging over the five curves. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe (38Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11566) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRDraw and NMRView (39Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence titrations were carried out using a QuantaMaster Spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Birmingham, NJ). Typically, solutions contained 1-2 μm ASPP2-CT or iASPP-CT in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide, 50-150 mm NaCl, and varying amounts of nonfluorescent p53 proteins (0-8 μm). Trp fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and emission spectra were recorded by scanning from 300 to 380 nm with a step size of 1 nm and integration of 1 s. Trp fluorescence experiments were carried out at 12 °C, the temperature of the emission maximum. Any background fluorescence of p53 was subtracted from the fluorescence of ASPPCT-p53 mixtures at the emission maximum. The net increase of Trp fluorescence was plotted against the concentration of added p53 proteins, and the binding isotherms were nonlinear best fitted using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) to extract dissociation constants. Binding of ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT to p53-PCD; Affinities and Binding Site Mapping by NMR—The interactions between the C-terminal domains of ASPP2 and iASPP (ASPP2-CT (residues 925-1128) and iASPP-CT (residues 623-828)) and p53 that comprised the Pro-rich and core domains of p53 (p53-PCD; residues 56-289) were investigated by NMR chemical shift mapping. Backbone resonance assignments of ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT based on three-dimensional HNCACB and HN(CO)CACB triple resonance experiments were essentially complete for ASPP2-CT (188 of 195 nonproline residues) and almost complete for iASPP-CT (168 of 193 nonproline residues). The binding sites for p53 on ASPP2-CT (Fig. 2, A and B) and iASPP-CT (Fig. 2, D and E) were determined using 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectroscopy following the amide resonances upon the addition of increasing amounts of p53-PCD. For ASPP2-CT, both fast (Thr1028, Trp993, and Met1021, each exhibiting small chemical shift changes upon binding) and intermediate-slow (Val1109, Ser1024, and Tyr1108, each exhibiting larger chemical shift changes upon binding) exchange was observed (insets in Fig. 2A). In contrast, most of the iASPP-CT resonances exhibited fast exchange upon p53-PCD binding (inset in Fig. 2D), indicating that the binding of iASPP-CT to p53-PCD is weaker than that of ASPP2-CT. Identification of the bound positions was straightforward for all resonances in the fast exchange regime but was difficult for those exhibiting intermediate-slow exchange; ASPP2-CT resonances exhibiting intermediate-slow exchange were frequently too broad to be observed at the mid-point of titration (insets in Fig. 2A; yellow). In these cases, the chemical shift differences between the free (black) and the first titration point (green) and between the last two titration points (cyan and red) were carefully investigated. Even if changes were very small, this approach allowed us to identify the direction of the shifts and to unambiguously distinguish bound from free frequencies for most residues in both ASPP-CT (Fig. 2B) and iASPP-CT (Fig. 2E). Several resonances in the ASPP2-CT spectrum exhibited significant spectral perturbations upon p53-PCD binding (Fig. 2B); for 23 residues, chemical shift changes larger than the mean plus one S.D. (0.068 ppm) are noted. Structural mapping of the affected residues by NMR reveal them to be clustered in the SH3 domain and in the loops between ankyrin repeats 2 and 3 and repeats 3 and 4. These NMR results are in good agreement with the x-ray model of the ASPP2-CT·p53-CD complex (33Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Extraction of a dissociation constant from the titration curves of selected ASPP2-CT resonances (Fig. 2C) yielded very similar values, with an average Kd of 1.3 ± 0.2 μm (also see Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of dissociation constants for ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT binding to various constructs of p53 determined by NMR, ITC, or fluorescencep53 variantsASPP variantsKd (NMR)Kd (ITC)Kd (fluorescence)μmμmμmp53-PCDASPP2-CT1.3 ± 0.2aKd values were obtained in the presence of 50 mm NaCl.1.5 ± 0.1aKd values were obtained in the presence of 50 mm NaCl.p53-PCDiASPP-CT76.7 ± 10.0aKd values were obtained in the presence of 50 mm NaCl.—bITC and fluorescence experiments were not performed for these pairs due to weak interaction.p53-PCD2FASPP2-CT2.2 ± 0.6cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.2.3 ± 0.3aKd values were obtained in the presence of 50 mm NaCl.2.8 ± 0.6aKd values were obtained in the presence of 50 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2FiASPP-CT107.5 ± 12.1cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.—bITC and fluorescence experiments were not performed for these pairs due to weak interaction.—bITC and fluorescence experiments were not performed for these pairs due to weak interaction.p53-PCD2F-LASPP2-CT2.2 ± 0.9cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.3.0 ± 0.5cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-LiASPP-CT11.1 ± 1.7cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.7.7 ± 5.9cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD (t)ASPP2-CT2.7 ± 0.6cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD (t)iASPP-CT7.6 ± 1.9cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD-BD (t)ASPP2-CT1.7 ± 0.2, 33 ± 8cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.,dThe titration curve was best fitted to two sequential binding events.1.9 ± 0.3cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD-BD (t)iASPP-CT—eITC data using iASPP-CT were not analyzed, because the sample precipitated during the experiment.4.6 ± 1.2cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD(L344R)-BD (d)ASPP2-CT1.9 ± 0.2, 29 ± 7cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.,dThe titration curve was best fitted to two sequential binding events.1.7 ± 0.3cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD(L344R)-BD (d)iASPP-CT—eITC data using iASPP-CT were not analyzed, because the sample precipitated during the experiment.3.3 ± 1.5cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD(L344P)-BD (m)ASPP2-CT1.5 ± 0.7cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.1.4 ± 0.3, 18 ± 5cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.,dThe titration curve was best fitted to two sequential binding events.1.6 ± 0.2cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-PCD2F-L-OD(L344P)-BD (m)iASPP-CT4.3 ± 1.1cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.—eITC data using iASPP-CT were not analyzed, because the sample precipitated during the experiment.3.0 ± 0.6cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-LASPP2-CT39.7 ± 4.8cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-LiASPP-CT15.9 ± 2.0cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-L-OD-BD (t)ASPP2-CT38.9 ± 5.0cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.p53-L-OD-BD (t)iASPP-CT17.8 ± 0.9cKd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.a Kd values were obtained in the presence of 50 mm NaCl.b ITC and fluorescence experiments were not performed for these pairs due to weak interaction.c Kd values were obtained in the presence of 150 mm NaCl.d The titration curve was best fitted to two sequential binding events.e ITC data using iASPP-CT were not analyzed, because the sample precipitated during the experiment. Open table in a new tab The effects of p53-PCD binding, as seen in the spectral data of iASPP-CT, were similar to those observed for ASPP2-CT in some ways but distinct in others. As in ASPP2-CT, resonances of residues residing in the SH3 domain and the junction between ankyrin repeats 3 and 4 of iASPP-CT exhibited significant perturbations upon interaction with p53-PCD (Fig. 2E), and 18 residues experienced chemical shift changes larger than the overall mean value plus 1 S.D. (0.031 ppm; Fig. 2E). However, all perturbations were much smaller than those observed for ASPP2-CT, and the large effects that were observed for residues residing between ankyrin repeats 3 and 4 of ASPP2-CT were significantly smaller in iASPP-CT. In addition, no effects were observed for residues connecting ankyrin repeats 2 and 3 in iASPP-CT. The NMR binding site mapping data clearly show that the interface in the iASPP-CT·p53-PCD complex is different from that in the ASPP2·p53-PCD complex; iASPP-CT mainly uses the SH3 domain to interact with p53-PCD, whereas ASPP2-CT uses both SH3 and ankyrin repeats. The results of our NMR binding experiments provide the first structural data on the p53/iASPP interface. The dissociation constant extracted from the NMR titration curves of selected iASPP-CT residues (Fig. 2F) for the iASPP-CT·p53-PCD complex was Kd = 76.7 ± 10.0 μm. This value reveals that the affinity of iASPP-CT to p53-PCD is ∼60-fold weaker than that of ASPP2-CT to p53-PCD. Our binding constants are in sharp contrast to previous reports that stated similar Kd values of 20-30 nm for both ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT binding to the core domain of p53 (p53-CD), as determined by surface plasmon resonance or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (33Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 34Robinson R.A. Lu X. Jones E.Y. Siebold C. Structure. 2008; 16: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This discrepancy cannot be easily explained based on the use of different lengths of proteins. The previously employed ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT protein constructs are very similar to those used here, with ASPP2-CT and iASPP-CT comprising residues 905-1128 and 625-828 (34Robinson R.A. Lu X.

It seems unlikely that the minor N-terminal variations have any impact on the interaction, since our NMR data clearly show that no interaction with p53 at the N termini of A"

BH4 deficiency has been associated with many neuropsychological disorders. An inherited defect in BH4 biosynthesis is caused by the deficiency of sepiapterin reductase (SPR), which catalyzes the biosynthesis of BH4 from guanosine triphosphate at the terminal step. The human SPR gene has been mapped at the PARK3 locus, which is related to the onset of Parkinson disease. In this study, we report that mutant strains, lemon (lem) and its lethal allele lemon lethal (lem1) with yellow body coloration, of the silkworm Bombyx mori could be used as the first insect model for human SPR deficiency diseases. We demonstrated that mutations in the SPR gene (BmSpr) were responsible for the irregular body coloration of lem and leml. Moreover, biochemical analysis revealed that SPR activity in leml larvae was almost completely diminished, resulting in a lethal phenotype that the larvae cannot feed and that die immediately after the first ecdysis. Oral administration of BH4 and dopamine to leml larvae effectively increased their survival rates and feeding abilities. Our data demonstrate that BmSPR plays a crucial role in the generation of BH4, and monoamine neurotransmitters in silkworms and the lem (leml) mutant strains will be an invaluable resource to address many questions regarding SPR and BH4 deficiencies.

These enzymes play an important role in the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and monoamine neurotransmitter biosynthesis (Fig. 1B) (1.Bonafe L. Thony B. Penzien J.M. Czarnecki B. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that BH4 deficiency is associated with numerous metabolic syndromes and neuropsychological disorders (2.Blau N. Barnes I. Dhondt J.N. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3.Blau N. Bonafe L. Thony B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). BH4 is synthesized from GTP through a cascade of three enzymes (i.e. GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16), 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydropterin (PTP) synthase (EC 4.6.1.10), and sepiapterin reductase (SPR; EC 1.1.1.153)) (Fig. 1A). SPR catalyzes the conversion of PTP to BH4 at the terminal step in the presence of reduced NADPH. It also catalyzes the reduction of sepiapterin (SP) to form BH4 by subsequent catalysis of dihydrobiopterin reductase (EC 1.6.99.7) (Fig. 1A). Mammalian SPRs have been a focus of study in recent years. The major symptoms of SPR deficiency are mental retardation, dystonia, spasticity, and movement disorder (1.Bonafe L. Thony B. Penzien J.M.

Diagnosis and therapy of SPR and/or BH4 deficiency-dependent genetic diseases, such as recessive DOPA-responsive dystonia and phenylketonuria, have been developed recently (3.Blau N. Bonafe L.

Takazawa et al. (6.Takazawa C. Fujimoto K. Homma D. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura T. Ichinose H. Katoh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 367: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that the human SPR gene could be a causative gene for PARK3, the original reported pedigree of Parkinson disease (7.Wszolek Z.K. Cordes M. Calne D.B. Muenter M.D. Cordes I. Pfeifer R.F. Nervenarzt. 1993; 64: 331-335PubMed Google Scholar). However, these findings are insufficient for developing treatments because patients from different families or regions exhibit distinct physiological and metabolic disorders due to SPR/BH4 deficiencies. Therefore, it is necessary to find or develop suitable models in other animals to obtain a better understanding of related human diseases. Recently, two groups generated Spr knock-out mice and concluded that these mice could be invaluable resources to address the issues regarding SPR/BH4 deficiencies (6.Takazawa C. Fujimoto K. Homma D.

SPR has been previously purified from the silkworm Bombyx mori, and its activity in the fat body of normal larvae has been characterized (9.Matsubara M. Tsusué M. Akino M. Nature. 1963; 199: 908-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10.Iino T. Dohke K. Tsusué M. Zool. Sci. 1992; 9: 119-125Google Scholar). However, the SPR gene (BmSpr) has not been identified yet in B. mori. lemon (lem) is a body color mutant of B. mori, which is regulated by a single recessive gene called lem (11.Banno Y. Fujii H. Kawaguchi Y. Yamamoto K. A Guide to the Silkworm Mutants 2005: Gene Name and Gene. Institute of Genetic Resources, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan2005Google Scholar). The lem silkworms display yellow body coloration during larval developmental stages, especially during molting, which is markedly different from that of wild-type strains (Fig. 2A). lemon lethal (leml) is a homozygous lethal allele of lem. The leml larvae grow normally in the first instar. After the first ecdysis, the leml larvae stop feeding, shake their heads frequently, and die within 3 days (Fig. 2, B and C) (12.Tsujita M. Jpn. J. Genet. 1955; 30: 107-117Crossref Google Scholar). lem (leml) was mapped onto the proximal end of the third linkage group of B. mori (11.Banno Y. Fujii H. Kawaguchi Y. Yamamoto K. A Guide to the Silkworm Mutants 2005: Gene Name and Gene. Institute of Genetic Resources, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan2005Google Scholar); however, the candidate gene itself remains unknown to date. Previous studies have shown that a large amount of yellow pteridines, SP, and sepialumazine accumulated in the integument of the lem larvae (13.Tsusué M. Akino M. Zool. Mag. 1965; 74: 91-94Google Scholar, 14.Goto M. Konishi M. Sugiura K. Tsusué M. Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan. 1966; 39: 929-932Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, SPR activity was absent in the lem mutant silkworms (9.Matsubara M. Tsusué M. Akino M. Nature. 1963; 199: 908-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Lack of SPR activity accelerates the accumulation of SP and sepialumazine (Fig. 1A). Collectively, these results suggest that SPR was related to irregular body coloration in the lem (leml) mutant. In this study, we characterized and identified the mutations in BmSpr of lem and leml mutants. Linkage analysis showed that BmSpr is the candidate gene for the lem (leml) mutant. In addition, biochemical studies revealed that a decrease in BmSPR activity is responsible for the abnormal coloration, and a loss of BmSPR activity leads to the lethality of leml larvae. Furthermore, we succeeded in increasing the survival rates of the leml larvae by oral inoculation of BH4 and dopamine. Together, we conclude that BmSPR plays a crucial role in the generation of BH4 and monoamine neurotransmitters in B. mori, similar to that in mammals. The utility of the lem (leml) mutant as a potential insect model for human SPR deficiency has been discussed in this study. Silkworm Strains—Five B. mori mutant lem strains (e36, l70, f40, r04, and b602) and one leml strain (a65) used in this study were obtained from Kyushu University (SilkwormBase; available on the World Wide Web). Normal strain 772 was obtained from the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences. Normal strains of p50T and Sho-on were maintained in our laboratory. All larvae were fed fresh mulberry leaves under normal conditions (12 h light/12 h dark, 25 °C). Genomic PCR and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Genomic DNA was prepared using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). Genomic PCR was performed using TaKaRa Ex Taq (TaKaRa). Total RNA was extracted from whole body or tissues, as described previously (15.Meng Y. Omuro N. Funaguma S. Daimon T. Kawaoka S. Katsuma S. Shimada T. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2008; 67: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Expression profiles of BmSpr in different stages or tissues were analyzed by RT-PCR using a TaKaRa RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa).

By sequencing cDNA and genomic clones, we obtained the full-length BmSpr sequence that encodes a putative SPR and determined its genomic structure. Protein Extract from Whole Body—Total proteins were extracted from each of the five individual pools at the beginning of the second larval instar. Whole bodies were homogenized in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The supernatant of the homogenates was collected by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 4 °C, 20 min) and subjected to the PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) for desalting and buffer exchange with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.4; 200 mm). The resultant solution was concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). The protein concentration was estimated using a Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant BmSPR—The coding regions of the wild-type, lem mutant type, and leml mutant type BmSpr with a His6 tag sequence at the C terminus were amplified by PCR from the corresponding cDNA templates. The primers used are listed in Table 1. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and ligated into a pET24b vector (Novagen), resulting in three recombinant expression vectors, pET/BmSPR, pET/BmmtSPR, and pET/BmmtSPRl. They were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells. BmSPR expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The transformants were cultured overnight at 15 °C following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in a B-PER bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. His-tagged BmSPRs were purified using a His GraviTrap nickel affinity column (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the eluate was desalted and concentrated. Protein concentration was determined as described above. Immunoblot Analysis—Expression of recombinant BmSPRs were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-His antibody (Qiagen), as described previously (19.Daimon T. Taguchi T. Meng Y. Katsuma S. Mita K. Shimada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15271-15279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore) using a blotting apparatus (Atto). The membrane was exposed to anti-His antibody (1:5000 dilution) and then to the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (1:5000 dilution). The blot was visualized using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a LAS 1000 imaging system (Fuji Film). Enzyme Assay—SPR activity was assayed according to the method reported by Katoh (21.Katoh S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Ten micrograms of protein from whole body or 0.1-0.5 μg of recombinant BmSPR was used in the assessment. The standard reaction mixture consisted of 100 μm NADPH (Sigma), 50 μm sepiapterin (Sigma), 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4), and the enzyme in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme and kept at 37 °C for 5-30 min. SPR activity was determined by measuring the rate of decrease in absorbance at 420 nm using a model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Reaction without the addition of the enzyme was used as a control. One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of the enzyme/μg of protein that catalyzed the reduction of 1 nmol of sepiapterin/min (nmol/min/μg), using an extinction coefficient for sepiapterin of 1.04 × 104/mol/cm at 420 nm. The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test to localize the significant difference. A p value of less than 0.01 was considered significant. To analyze the effect of pH on SPR activity, the final concentration of 20 mm Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 2.0-12.0) was used. To analyze the effect of temperature on SPR activity, each reaction mixture was kept at temperatures ranging from 20 to 90 °C for 5 min. The effect of the substrate concentration on SPR activity was analyzed by varying sepiapterin concentrations from 2.5 to 160 μm in the presence of 0.1 μg of protein and saturating amounts of 250 μm NADPH. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 5 min. Kinetic parameters of maximal velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis constant (Km) were estimated using the double reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plot (22.Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). Inhibition of B. mori SPR by melatonin and N-acetylserotonin (Sigma) was investigated using 0.2 μg of protein at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions with 1% ethanol were used as controls. Linkage Analysis—Normal strain p50T, lem strain l70, and leml strain a65 were used in genetic linkage analysis. The F1 male moths of p50T and l70 were backcrossed with l70 females. Single nucleotide polymorphism at nt 786 in the BmSpr ORF of BC1 individuals was investigated by genomic PCR and direct sequencing of the PCR products (Table 2). The F1 moths of p50T and a65 (leml/+) were sibling-mated. Genotypes of F2 individuals randomly sampled from several broods were determined by a PCR marker in BmSpr ORF (Table 2). Genomic DNA was isolated using the Wizard SV 96 genomic DNA purification system (Promega), as described in the recommended protocol. The primers used are listed in Table 1. DNA sequences were determined using the ABI Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 3130 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems).TABLE 2Linkage analysislemlemlPhenotype (genotype)SNP in BmSpr ORF (nt 786)Phenotype (genotype)PCR marker in BmSpr ORFA/TA/A325 bp only325 bp and 352 bp352 bp onlyNormal (lem/+)500Normal (+/+)3500Yellow (lem/lem)0140Normal (leml/+)0560Yellow and lethal (leml/leml)0096 Open table in a new tab BH4 and Monoamine Feeding Experiment—To investigate the rescue effect of BH4 on the leml larvae, 10-fold diluted concentrations (0.03-30 mm) of BH4 (Wako) were orally supplied to newly hatched leml/leml larvae of the a65 strain. Fresh mulberry leaves were chopped and completely permeated in freshly prepared BH4 solutions. The leaves were dried in air and fed to the larvae every day. Survival rates were recorded from the beginning of second instar (day 0 in Fig. 6A). Oral administration of two monoamines, dopamine (Sigma) or serotonin (Wako), at a final concentration of 50 mm was performed against third instar leml larvae, which were survived by supplying 30 mm BH4 until the second ecdysis. Survival rate curves were recorded from day 1 to day 4. Feeding abilities of the living larvae were examined by counting their feces (more than 10 feces, high food intake; 1-10 feces, low food intake; no feces, nonfeeding). Distilled water-wetted leaves were used as a negative control. Characterization of BmSpr Gene in Normal and Mutant Strains—Previous studies showed that SPR deficiency is involved in abnormal body coloration of the lem (leml) mutant (9.Matsubara M. Tsusué M. Akino M. Nature. 1963; 199: 908-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13.Tsusué M. Akino M. Zool. Mag. 1965; 74: 91-94Google Scholar, 14.Goto M. Konishi M. Sugiura K. Tsusué M. Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan. 1966; 39: 929-932Crossref Google Scholar). To examine whether the B. mori SPR gene (BmSpr) corresponds to lem (leml), we first determined a full-length cDNA sequence of BmSpr using expressed sequence tag data bases (16.Mita K. Morimyo M. Okano K. Koike Y. Nohata J. Kawasaki H. Kadono-Okuda K. Yamamoto K. Suzuki M.G. Shimada T. Goldsmith M.R. Maeda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14121-14126Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The sequence is located on Bm_scaf63, which is a newly integrated scaffold near the end of chromosome 3 (KAIKObase; available on the World Wide Web). We determined the gene structures of BmSpr in normal and mutant strains by genomic primer walking and identified the mutations in BmSpr open reading frames (ORFs) of the mutants (Fig. 3A). BmSpr comprised an ORF of 798 bp, which encodes a 266-aa protein with a predicted molecular mass of 29.2 kDa (Fig. 3B). In the BmSpr ORF of five lem strains, a single nucleotide mutation was identified at the same position (T786A), which formed an abnormal forward stop codon and resulted in a 5-aa deletion (-YFDDE) at the C terminus. In the leml strain, 27 nt were inserted in tandem in the middle of the BmSpr ORF, which resulted in an addition of 9 aa (-EYYDLNVFN-) (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, one or two genomic insertions were found in the third intron of the mutant BmSpr (Fig. 3A). Enzyme Activity of BmSPR—We investigated the SPR activities in different genotypic larvae at the beginning of the second instar (Fig. 4A). When compared with the SPR activities in normal phenotypes, the activities in lem mutant silkworms were significantly low, and almost no activity was detected in the leml mutant silkworms. To investigate the enzymatic properties of BmSPR and compare the activities between normal and mutant proteins, we produced the three recombinant proteins using a bacterial expression system. Expression and purification of recombinant BmSPRs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5, A and B). Our analyses showed that BmSPR was a typical NADPH-dependent enzyme (Fig. 5C), which exhibited suitable enzymatic parameters to the substrate of SP with Km of 28.3 μm and Vmax of 14.5 nmol/min/μg (Table 3). Increase in activity was observed at pH 4-6 with pH 5 being an optimal condition (data not shown). The most suitable reaction temperature for BmSPR was 50 °C (data not shown). Moreover, two potent inhibitors of mammalian SPRs, melatonin and N-acetylserotonin, significantly inhibited BmSPR activity, with IC50 of 100 and 200 μm, respectively (data not shown). Comparison among the three proteins showed that the enzyme activity of BmmtSPR (lem type) and BmmtSPRl (leml type) was 15 and 3%, respectively, as compared with that of the normal BmSPR (Fig. 4B). The values were consistent with SPR activities measured in the second instar larvae of the normal and lem and leml mutants (Fig. 4A). These data show that reduced SPR activity correlates with abnormal coloration and mortality in the mutant strains.FIGURE 5Expression of recombinant BmSPR proteins and enzymatic property of normal BmSPR. Three recombinant proteins, normal type BmSPR, and two mutant types, BmmtSPR (lem) and BmmtSPRl (leml), were expressed using a bacterial expression system and purified using nickel chromatography columns.

Biophys. 1971; 146: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab Linkage Analysis—To determine the consistency between the lem or leml phenotype and the BmSpr genotype, we performed linkage analysis between the normal and lem or leml using p50T, l70, and a65 strains, respectively. We backcrossed F1 male moths of the normal and lem with lem females. Single nucleotide polymorphism of a total of 190 individuals from (lem/lem × lem/+) was sequenced in BmSpr ORF at nt 786 (Table 2). Moreover, we analyzed the genotypes of 187 F2 individuals of the normal and leml by a PCR marker in BmSpr ORF (Table 2). The results showed that phenotypes of all of the individuals were identical with their genotypes (i.e. no recombination between BmSpr and lem or leml was detected among their progenies). Based on these results, we concluded that the candidate gene BmSpr corresponds to lem (leml). Therapeutic Effects of BH4 and Monoamine Administration—The leml larvae, in which SPR activity was almost completely diminished, do not eat and die immediately after the first ecdysis. To verify whether SPR deficiency-induced lack of BH4 is responsible for the lethality of the leml mutant, we performed BH4 administration experiments by oral inoculation. We found that BH4 administration effectively improved the growth and development of the leml larvae in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). Larvae fed with lower concentrations of BH4 ate fewer mulberry leaves and developed more slowly than those fed with 30 mm BH4, which showed body size similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 6B). Although a majority of the larvae fed with 30 mm BH4 died during the larval stage, about 8% individuals grew normally with a 7-11-day-longer larval period and successfully accomplished the morphological transition from larvae to pupae (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we performed oral administration experiments with two monoamines, dopamine and serotonin. The results clearly showed that, similar to BH4, dopamine administration effectively increased the survival rates of leml larvae, because this treatment drastically improved their feeding abilities (Fig. 6C). In contrast, serotonin administration did not show any positive effects on survival rates and feeding behavior of the leml larvae (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these results suggest that BH4 deficiency results in the lethal phenotype observed in the leml mutant, which is mainly due to the lack of dopamine. In this paper, we report the identification and characterization of BmSpr and conclude that BmSpr corresponds to the yellow body color mutant lem (leml) of the silkworm B. mori. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that the mutations in BmSpr significantly reduced SPR activity both in the lem (leml) larvae and in mutant BmSPR proteins. Moreover, oral administration of BH4 and dopamine successfully increased the survival rates of the leml larvae, suggesting that BH4 deficiency induced by loss of BmSPR activity leads to the lethality of leml larvae, probably due to the lack of dopamine. Therefore, we propose that the lem (leml) mutant can be regarded as a useful insect model for human SPR-deficient diseases. Various pteridine derivates synthesized from GTP are the primary components in insect body coloration (Fig. 1A). The larval body color in B. mori is determined by the concentrations of melanin in the cuticle and of xanthommatin, sepialumazine, sepiapterin, and uric acid in the epidermis (23.Mazda T. Tsusué M. Sakate S. Insect Biochem. 1980; 10: 357-362Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24.Ohashi M. Tsusué M. Yoshitake N. Sakate S. Kiguchi K. J. Seric. Sci.

Synthesis of pteridine from GTP is possible when a number of enzymes, including SPR (EC 1.1.1.153) and sepiapterin deaminase (EC 3.5.4.24) (Fig. 1A), cooperate. Our data indicated that the 5-aa deletion at the end of BmSPR in lem and the 9-aa insertion in the middle of BmSPR in leml caused a marked decrease in SPR activity, although important motifs for SPR activity are highly conserved in lem and leml (Figs. 3B and 4) (26.Auerbach G.

Katoh S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These data proved that mutations in BmSpr are responsible for the abnormal accumulation of yellow pteridines in the integuments of lem (leml) (13.Tsusué M. Akino M. Zool. Mag. 1965; 74: 91-94Google Scholar, 14.Goto M. Konishi M. Sugiura K. Tsusué M. Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan. 1966; 39: 929-932Crossref Google Scholar). Park et al. (28.Park Y.S. Heizmann C.W. Wermuth B. Levine R.A. Steinerstauch J. Guzman J. Blau N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) proposed that in the case of complete SPR defect, BH4 biosynthesis from PTP could be compensated by carbonyl and/or aldose reductases in humans. However, Bonafe et al. (1.Bonafe L. Thony B. Penzien J.M. Czarnecki B. Blau N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) showed that the compensation might be true for some peripheral tissues but not for the brain. Similarly, in the silkworm, Iino et al. (29.Iino T. Sawada H. Tsusué M. Takikawa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30.Iino T. Takikawa S.I. Yamamoto T. Sawada H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) discovered two carbonyl enzymes in the fat body and integument, which could reduce PTP to form BH4. However, the BH4 forming activity in the lem mutant was 10-fold lower than in the normal strain (29.Iino T. Sawada H. Tsusué M. Takikawa S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the salvage pathways cannot provide sufficient BH4, unlike the BH4 biosynthesis pathway catalyzed by SPR. Biochemical analysis showed that BmSPR exhibited enzymatic properties more similar to those of mammalian SPRs than to Drosophila SPR (Table 3) (21.Katoh S. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31.Ruiz-Vazquez P. Silva F.J. Ferre J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Acta. 1982; 717: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which was consistent with a previous report (10.Iino T. Dohke K. Tsusué M. Zool. Sci. 1992; 9: 119-125Google Scholar). Collectively, the biosynthetic pathway of BH4 and the enzymatic properties of SPR are similar between Bombyx and mammals, suggesting that the silkworm is a suitable animal for studying human SPR/BH4 deficiency. In mammals, BH4 exhibits various physiological functions, such as acting as a cofactor for aromatic hydroxylases and nitric-oxide synthase. Therefore, appropriate levels of BH4 are necessary for the metabolism of phenylalanine and the production of monoamine neurotransmitters (Fig. 1B) (8.Yang S. Lee Y.J. Kim J.-M. Park S. Peris J. Laipis P. Park Y.S. Chung J.H. Oh S.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2006; 78: 575-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In general, patients with BH4 deficiency present progressive neuronal deterioration, convulsions, abnormal movements, and difficulty in swallowing (2.Blau N. Barnes I. Dhondt J.N. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1996; 19: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Abnormal symptoms observed in the leml larvae, such as head shaking and feeding inability after the first ecdysis, are strikingly similar. Oral inoculation of BH4 effectively improved the feeding ability of the leml larvae and enabled them to grow normally through the larval developmental stage (Fig. 6, A and B), suggesting that loss of BmSPR activity reduced BH4 to a lethal level in the leml larvae. Further, we observed that oral inoculation of dopamine also effectively improved the survival rate and feeding ability of leml larvae (Fig. 6C). These results demonstrate that SPR deficiency-induced lack of dopamine results in the abnormal behavior observed in the leml larvae. SPR deficiency in patients was frequently misdiagnosed as dihydrobiopterin reductase deficiency (3.Blau N. Bonafe L. Thony B. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 74: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although diagnosis and therapy of SPR/BH4 deficiencies have advanced in recent years (1.Bonafe L. Thony B. Penzien J.M.

Several invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, have been used as animal models for human diseases (33.Mahajan-Miklos S. Tan M.W. Rahme L.G. Ausubel F.M.

Together with these invertebrate animal models, the silkworm larvae have a number of advantages as an animal model; they are genetically tractable, easily maintained in laboratories throughout the year using artificial diets, and can be reared on a large scale at low cost. Moreover, the advantage of the large body size of silkworm larvae, which makes handling easier when injecting drugs and microorganisms but can be a practical problem in small animals, has made B. mori a useful model for infection with human pathogenic microorganisms (36.Kaito C.

Virol. 2008; 89: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on the present results, we propose the lem (leml) mutant as the first insect model for human SPR deficiency. Recent studies have shown that Spr-null mice display greatly decreased amounts of BH4, severe monoamine deficiencies, and growth retardation. Also, a majority of mice died within 1-2 months (6.Takazawa C. Fujimoto K. Homma D. Sumi-Ichinose C. Nomura T. Ichinose H. Katoh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Similar to the rescue effects of BH4 and dopamine feeding on the leml larvae, oral administration of BH4 and neurotransmitters completely rescued dwarfism and phenylalanine metabolism (6.Takazawa C.

Together with the present results, we hope that the silkworm lem (leml) mutant can provide useful information for clinical diagnosis, for therapy options, and for screening therapeutic agents or new drug candidates for human SPR deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2001023856,"Tissue-engineered models that mimic in vivo tissue organization offer the potential of capturing complex signaling pathways in vitro. In the liver, hepatocytes and endothelial cells are closely associated but separated by the extracellular matrix of the space of Disse. This unique configuration was mimicked by embedding primary hepatocytes in collagen gel and overlaying the matrix with endothelial cells. We demonstrate that during the first few days of culture, the secretion of albumin and fibrinogen was 2-fold higher in cocultures compared to hepatocytes alone. Hepatocyte function in both cultures stabilized to a similar level during the second week, suggesting that endothelial cells can induce the early recovery of hepatocytes after isolation and seeding. Endothelial cell-conditioned medium reproduced the effect of coculture in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting a role for endothelial cell-derived soluble factors. Endothelial cell-conditioned medium increased mRNA levels of various acute-phase proteins such as albumin, fibrinogen, transferrin, and alpha-macroglobulin in hepatocytes. Surprisingly, the effect of endothelial cell-conditioned medium was not mediated by growth factors or cytokines, or by secreted extracellular matrix, but by the release of the amino acid proline, which mediates endogenous collagen synthesis by hepatocytes. These findings suggest an important role for proline secretion by endothelial cells as a paracrine factor regulating hepatocyte function."
https://openalex.org/W2043927239,"Neural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (bHLHs) control many aspects of neurogenesis, such as proliferation, fate determination, and differentiation. We have previously shown that the promyogenic cell surface receptor Cdo modulates the Cdc42 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways via a direct association with two scaffold-type proteins, JLP and Bnip-2, to regulate activities of myogenic bHLH factors and myogenic differentiation. We report here that Cdo uses similar regulatory mechanisms to promote neuronal differentiation. Expression of JLP, a scaffold protein for p38MAPK, and Bnip-2, a regulator of Cdc42, is increased during differentiation of C17.2 neural precursor cells and P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. These molecules regulate Cdc42 and p38MAPK activities, which increase in a Cdo-dependent manner during neuronal differentiation of C17.2 cells and retinoic acid-treated P19 cells. Furthermore, enhancement or reduction of Cdc42 and p38MAPK activities enhances or reduces, respectively, neuronal differentiation of these cell lines. Cdc42 and p38MAPK activities also promote heterodimerization of neurogenin1 and E47, suggesting that one way they promote neurogenesis is via regulation of neural bHLH factor activities. These results imply that a conserved intracellular signaling mechanism initiated by Cdo regulates the activities of tissue-specific bHLH factors and therefore functions as a key regulator of differentiation of several different cell lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2080459032,"In this study, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H and F regulate proteolipid protein (PLP)/DM20 alternative splicing. G-rich sequences in exon 3B, G1 and M2, are required for hnRNPH- and F-mediated regulation of the PLP/DM20 ratio and, when placed between competing 5′ splice sites in an α-globin minigene, direct hnRNPH/F-regulated alternative splicing. In contrast, the activity of the intronic splicing enhancer, which is necessary for PLP splicing, is only modestly reduced by removal of hnRNPH/F both in PLP and α-globin gene context. In vivo, hnRNPH reversed reduction of DM20 splicing induced by hnRNPH/F removal, whereas hnRNPF had little effect. Tethering of the MS2-hnRNPH fusion protein downstream of the DM20 5′ splice site increased DM20 splicing, whereas MS2-hnRNPF did not.

Depending on the gene context, these splicing factors have different affinity for their cognate sequences and appear to act in concert to regulate splicing of a number of genes (13.Alkan S.A.

Although they are most often inhibitors of alternatively spliced exons, they can also function as enhancers (14.Caputi M. Zahler A.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3501-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In genes containing short introns, these G-rich sequences allow splice site recognition through an intron-definition mechanism (22.Carlo T. Sterner D.A. Berget S.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 342-353PubMed Google Scholar, 23.McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In an artificial α-globin gene construct containing duplicated 5′ splice sites flanked by identical G triplets, the G-rich sequences favor selection of the distal 5′ splice site through binding of U1snRNA to the G-rich sequence by direct base pairing (24.McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9225-9235Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).The proteolipid protein (PLP) gene gives rise to two isoforms, PLP and DM20, through alternative splicing of competing 5′ splice sites resulting in either inclusion or exclusion of exon 3B. G-rich enhancers, named M2 and ISE, flank the DM20 and PLP 5′ splice sites, respectively (25.Hobson G.M. Huang Z. Sperle K. Stabley D.L. Marks H.G. Cambi F. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26.Nave K.A. Lai C. Bloom F.E. Milner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, there are other G-rich sequences in exon 3B, and all are potential hnRNPH/F binding motifs (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28.Schaub M.C. Lopez S.R. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13617-13626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The PLP/DM20 ratio increases in postnatal brain development and in differentiated oligodendrocytes, and this is temporally related to reduced expression of hnRNPH and F (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29.Wang E. Dimova N. Sperle K. Huang Z. Lock L. McCulloch M.C. Edgar J.M. Hobson G.M. Cambi F. Exp. Neurol. 2008; 214: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The DM20 isoform is preferentially expressed in embryonic brain and non-glial cells (30.LeVine S.M. Wong D. Macklin W.B. Dev. Neurosci. 1990; 12: 235-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Knockdown of hnRNPH and F synergistically increased the PLP/DM20 ratio, and this effect was mediated by M2 in concert with some or all of the G runs present in PLP exon 3B, whereas the ISE had little contribution to this regulation (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). hnRNPH and F have been shown to serve redundant functions in regulating alternative splicing and to cooperatively regulate other genes (17.Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31.Crawford J.B. Patton J.G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2008; 28: 5403-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); however, to the best of our knowledge, a synergistic effect such as that observed with PLP alternative splicing was not previously reported.In this study, we sought to investigate further the mechanism by which hnRNPH and F regulate the PLP/DM20 ratio. A proximal G-rich sequence (G1) and M2 are required for hnRNPH- and F-mediated regulation of the PLP/DM20 ratio. In contrast, the ISE enhancer's activity is only modestly reduced by removal of hnRNPH/F. In vivo, hnRNPH and F are not functionally redundant, and hnRNPH plays a primary role in regulating the PLP/DM20 ratio. In vitro, hnRNPH and hnRNPF were able to restore binding of U1snRNP, which was greatly reduced by removal of hnRNPH/F. The data show that both hnRNPH and F regulate DM20 splicing by recruiting U1snRNP and suggest that hnRNPH may have additional functions in regulating the splicing machinery.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The pcDNA-MS2-H and pcDNA-MS2-F plasmids expressing MS2 coat protein fused in-frame to Myc-hisA-tagged hnRNPH and F, respectively, were a generous gift of Dr. Mark McNally (33.McNally L.M. Yee L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2478-2488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The pFLAG-hnRNPH and pFLAG-hnRNPF plasmids were a generous gift of Dr. Mariano Garcia-Blanco (32.Mauger D.M. Lin C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5403-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These plasmids were used in transfections into Oli-neu cells treated with siF/H, which targets a sequence common to mouse hnRNPH and F. The human hnRNPF has a two-nucleotide mismatch with the mouse sequence targeted by the siF/H, thus it is resistant to siRNAs-mediated degradation. The siF/H-targeted sequence is identical between the human and mouse hnRNPH transcripts, and the FLAG-hnRNPH transcript is targeted by siF/H and degraded (data not shown). To make FLAG-hnRNPH resistant to siF/H degradation, we changed two nucleotides (supplemental Table S1). The SRp40 was a kind gift of Dr. Stefan Stamm. The wild-type α-globin splicing construct was a kind gift of Dr. Andrew McCullough (23.McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mutant PLP-neo (Figs. 1, 2A, and 5) and α-globin constructs (Figs. 2B and 3A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In the PLP-neo, the G runs were replaced by polyTs, as previously described (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the α-globin construct, the G runs were mutated as previously described (23.McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or replaced by G1M2 or ISE sequences from the PLP exon 3B as indicated in Fig. 3. The distance of the ISE and G1M2 sequences relative to the α-globin 5′ splice sites was the same as that in their endogenous position in the PLP gene. The SαGLO-ISE was generated by deleting the duplicated sequence containing the G1M2 in the α-glo-G1M2-ISE, thus leaving a single α-globin 5′ splice site and the downstream intron containing ISE (Fig. 2B). The SαGLO-ISEMT1, -MT2, and -MT3 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the SαGLO-ISE (Fig. 2B). The PLPneo-MS1 and PLPneo-NR were made by replacing twenty-two nucleotides spanning G1, M2, and the intervening five nucleotides with twenty-two nucleotides containing the MS2 protein binding motif or an unrelated sequence (Fig. 5). The PLP-neo-MS2 (data not shown) and -MS3 were made by replacing twenty-two nucleotides spanning M4–M6 and M3–M5 with the MS2 protein binding motif, respectively, in the PLP-neo-MS1 (Fig. 5). The Bcl-x minigene construct was a kind gift of Dr. Charles Chalfant (34.Massiello A. Salas A. Pinkerman R.L. Roddy P. Roesser J.R. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol.

Oli-neu cells were cultured in SATO medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 ng/ml biotin, 10 ng/ml apotransferrin, 100 μm putrescine, 2 μm progesterone, 2 μm sodium selenite, 2.5 μg/ml insulin) with 1% horse serum (27.Wang E.

Fibroblast L cells and the neuronal Neuro2A cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNAs (0.5 μg, unless otherwise indicated) and siRNAs (80 nm) using the siPORT amine transfection reagent according to the Neofection protocol (Ambion) (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that expression of hnRNPF was not affected by treatment with siH3, and expression of hnRNPH was not affected by treatment with siF3, thus excluding compensation effects (data not shown). In overexpression studies, 0.5 μg of DNA of the splicing construct was co-transfected with 0.5, 1, and 1.5 μg of the expression plasmid DNA or 0.5 μg of the empty vector pcDNA3 using the siPORT amine transfection reagent.RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was treated with the DNA-free Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using random hexamer primer mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). The PCR products derived from the wild-type and mutated PLP-neo constructs were amplified by RT-PCR using a primer set previously described (Fig. 1) (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F.

The proximal and distal splice products derived from the wild-type and mutated α-globin constructs were amplified by RT-PCR with a forward primer (5′-TGGTACCGAGCTCGGATCCGATGT-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GATGGATATCTGCAGAATTCGGGA-3′) complementary to sequences in pcDNA3 vector (Figs. 2B and 3). The XL and XS products derived from the Bcl-x minigene construct were amplified by RT-PCR with primers described previously (36.Paronetto M.P. Achsel T. Massiello A. Chalfant C.E. Sette C. J.

The wild-type RNA template spans 10 nucleotides upstream and 35 nucleotides downstream of the DM20 5′ splice site and contains the DM20 5′ splice site and the G-rich enhancers, G1 and M2 (DM20-G1M2-WT, Fig. 6). The mutated RNA template is identical to the wild-type except that G1 and M2 sequences were replaced by polyUs (DM20-G1M2-MT, Fig. 6). RNA templates were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). RNA affinity precipitations were performed with biotinylated RNA templates, as previously described (27.Wang E.

Selected bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-MS/MS and liquid chromatography-MS/MS (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F.

Nitrocellulose membranes were reacted with antibodies to: U1 70K (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA), U1A (Aviva Systems Biology), hnRNPH (Bethyl Laboratories) and hnRNPHF (rabbit polyclonal, generous gift of Dr. Douglas Black), A1 and L (Abcam), SRp40 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Myc tag (Invitrogen), and FLAG tag (Sigma) diluted 1:2000, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted 1:2000, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Blots were visualized with a Kodak 440CF Digital Image Station using one-dimensional analysis software.RESULTSThe Synergistic Effect of hnRNPH/F Is Mediated by G1 and M2—We have shown previously that siRNA-mediated knock-down of hnRNPH and F synergistically increased the PLP/DM20 ratio in oligodendrocytes, and this effect was in large part dependent on M2 and G runs in exon 3B, named G1, G4, and G5.To determine the G runs that are necessary for the hnRNPH/F synergism in addition to M2, we tested the impact of individual mutations of G1, G4, and G5 on the hnRNPH/F-mediated increase in PLP/DM20 ratio (Fig. 1, A and B). Oli-neu cells were transfected with the G1-MT, G4-MT, and G5-MT constructs and the plasmid-derived PLP and DM20 products were amplified by RT-PCR in RNA isolated from cells cultured for 72 h in growth medium. Although the PLP/DM20 ratio derived from G4-MT and G5-MT was 0.15 ± 0.02 and 0.1 ± 0.03, respectively, compared with 0.38 ± 0.02 with the WT construct, the PLP/DM20 ratio derived from G1-MT was 3.06 ± 0.4 (Fig. 1, C (upper panel) and D). The data suggest that G1 is an enhancer of the DM20 5′ splice site, whereas G4 and G5 appear to enhance PLP 5′ splice site selection, in keeping with the results obtained previously with M6-MT and M8-MT, mutations that encompass G4 and G5, respectively (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). G1-MT increased the PLP/DM20 ratio by 8-fold compared with ∼5-fold induced by M2-MT (3.06 ± 0.40 versus 2.05 ± 0.20) (Fig. 1, C (upper panel) and D (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), suggesting that G1 is a stronger enhancer of DM20 5′ splice site than M2. For mutations of G1 and M2, G1M2-MT increased the PLP/DM20 ratio to 3.61 ± 0.8 (Fig. 1, C (upper panel) and D). Mutations of G1 and M2 combined with the ISE deletion, G1M2-MT/ISEdel, resulted in a PLP/DM20 ratio of 0.44 ± 0.06 (Fig. 1, C (upper panel) and D). This is higher than the wild-type ratio, but lower than the G1M2 mutation alone and reflects the loss of both the PLP 5′ splice site-enhancing ISE and the DM20 5′ splice site-enhancing G1 and M2 sequences. Likewise, the PLP/DM20 ratio derived from constructs in which G1M2, G4, and G5 are all mutated and the ISE is present, is 0.7 ± 0.1 and is higher than that derived from M2G1G4G5-MT/ISEdel (0.21 ± 0.01 (27.Wang E. Dimova N. Cambi F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4164-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), reflecting the loss of the PLP-enhancing function of G4, G5, and the ISE (see next section) (Fig. 1, C (upper panel) and D). The data indicate that, in addition to M2, G1 is an enhancer of DM20 5′ splice site selection.We next assessed whether siRNA-mediated knock-down of hnRNPH and F (siH/F) affected the PLP/DM20 ratio derived from G1-MT, G4-MT, G5-MT, and G1M2-MT in Oli-n"
https://openalex.org/W2124366235,"Serotonin (5-HT) stimulates pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and has been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) mutations similarly have been linked to PAH. However, possible crosstalk between 5-HT and BMPR signaling remains poorly characterized. We report here that 5-HT activates Smads 1/5/8 in bovine and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and causes translocation of these Smads from cytoplasm to the nucleus. DN BMPR1A blocked 5-HT activation of Smads 1/5/8 by 5-HT and BMPR1A overexpression enhanced it. Activation of Smads by 5-HT occurred through the 5-HT 1B/1D receptor as it was blocked with the inhibitor GR 55562 but unaffected by inhibitors of the 5-HT transporter and a variety of 5-HT receptors. Activation of the Smads by 5-HT depended on Rho/Rho kinase signaling as it was blocked by Y27632, but unaffected by inhibitors of PI3K or MAPK. Transfection of cells with BMPR1A and ligation of the BMP receptor with BMP-2 also activated GTP-Rho A of these SMCs, while DN BMPR1A blocked the activation. 5-HT stimulated an increase in serine/threonine phosphorylation of BMPR1A, supporting the activation of BMPR1A by 5-HT in SMCs. Infusion of 5-HT into mice with miniosmotic infusion pumps caused activation of Smads 1/5/8 in lung tissue, demonstrating the effect in vivo. The studies support a unique concept that 5-HT transactivates the serine kinase receptor, BMPR 1A, to activate Smads 1/5/8 via Rho and Rho kinase in pulmonary artery SMCs. Rho and Rho kinase also participate in the activation of Smads by BMP."
https://openalex.org/W2106471781,"The mechanism by which the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase from two yeast species is activated allosterically has been elucidated. A total of seven three-dimensional structures of the enzyme, of enzyme variants, or of enzyme complexes from two yeast species, three of them reported here for the first time, provide detailed atomic resolution snapshots along the activation coordinate. The prime event is the covalent binding of the substrate pyruvate to the side chain of cysteine 221, thus forming a thiohemiketal. This reaction causes the shift of a neighboring amino acid, which eventually leads to the rigidification of two otherwise flexible loops, one of which provides two histidine residues necessary to complete the enzymatically competent active site architecture. The structural data are complemented and supported by kinetic investigations and binding studies, providing a consistent picture of the structural changes occurring upon enzyme activation."
https://openalex.org/W2081100760,"Background The Dickkopf (DKK) family comprises a set of proteins that function as regulators of Wnt/β–catenin signaling and has a crucial role in development. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of this family in tumorigenesis, however their role in tumorigenesis is still remained unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We found increased expression of DKK2 but decreased expression of DKK1 in Ewing family tumor (EFT) cells. We showed that EFT-specific EWS/ETS fusion proteins enhance the DKK2 promoter activity, but not DKK1 promoter activity, via ets binding sites (EBSs) in the 5′ upstream region. EWS/ETS-mediated transactivation of the promoter was suppressed by the deletion and mutation of EBSs located upstream of the DKK2 gene. Interestingly, the inducible expression of EWS/ETS resulted in the strong induction of DKK2 expression and inhibition of DKK1 expression in human primary mesenchymal progenitor cells that are thought to be a candidate of cell origin of EFT. In addition, using an EFT cell line SK-ES1 cells, we also demonstrated that the expression of DKK1 and DKK2 is mutually exclusive, and the ectopic expression of DKK1, but not DKK2, resulted in the suppression of tumor growth in immuno-deficient mice. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggested that DKK2 could not functionally substitute for DKK1 tumor-suppressive effect in EFT. Given the mutually exclusive expression of DKK1 and DKK2, EWS/ETS regulates the transcription of the DKK family, and the EWS/ETS-mediated DKK2 up-regulation could affect the tumorigenicity of EFT in an indirect manner."
https://openalex.org/W1977238438,"ATP synthase uses a unique rotational mechanism to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy and back into chemical energy. The helix-turn-helix motif, termed ""DELSEED-loop,"" in the C-terminal domain of the beta subunit was suggested to be involved in coupling between catalysis and rotation. Here, the role of the DELSEED-loop was investigated by functional analysis of mutants of Bacillus PS3 ATP synthase that had 3-7 amino acids within the loop deleted. All mutants were able to catalyze ATP hydrolysis, some at rates several times higher than the wild-type enzyme. In most cases ATP hydrolysis in membrane vesicles generated a transmembrane proton gradient, indicating that hydrolysis occurred via the normal rotational mechanism. Except for two mutants that showed low activity and low abundance in the membrane preparations, the deletion mutants were able to catalyze ATP synthesis. In general, the mutants seemed less well coupled than the wild-type enzyme, to a varying degree. Arrhenius analysis demonstrated that in the mutants fewer bonds had to be rearranged during the rate-limiting catalytic step; the extent of this effect was dependent on the size of the deletion. The results support the idea of a significant involvement of the DELSEED-loop in mechanochemical coupling in ATP synthase. In addition, for two deletion mutants it was possible to prepare an alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplex and measure nucleotide binding to the catalytic sites. Interestingly, both mutants showed a severely reduced affinity for MgATP at the high affinity site."
https://openalex.org/W2007539214,"A growing body of experimental and clinical studies supports a strong association between psychological stress and cardiovascular disease. An important endogenous cardioprotective role in heart physiology has been attributed to corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2beta (CRFR2beta). Here, we report the isolation of cDNA from mouse (m) heart encoding a novel CRFR2beta splice variant. Translation of this insertion variant (iv)-mCRFR2beta isoform produces a 421-aa protein that includes a unique C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Our functional analysis and cellular localization studies demonstrated that when coexpressed with wild-type mCRFR2beta, iv-mCRFR2beta significantly inhibited the wild-type mCRFR2beta membrane expression and its functional signaling by ER-Golgi complex retention, suggesting a dose-dependent dominant negative effect. Interestingly, mice exposed to a 4-wk paradigm of chronic variable stress, a model of chronic psychological stress in humans, presented significantly lower levels of mCRFR2beta and higher levels of iv-mCRFR2beta mRNA expression in their hearts, compared to nonstressed control mice. The dominant-negative effect of iv-mCRFR2beta and its up-regulation by psychological stress suggest a new form of regulation of the mCRFR2beta cardioprotective effect and a potential role for this novel isoform in stress-induced heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W1997050929,"This study evaluated whether transgenic expression of PTP-oc (osteoclastic transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase) in cells of the osteoclast lineage would affect bone resorption and bone density in young adult mice. Transgenic mice were generated with a transgenic construct using a tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase exon 1C promoter to drive expression of rabbit PTP-oc in osteoclastic cells. pQCT evaluation of femurs of young adult male progeny of three lines showed that transgenic mice had reduced bone volume and area, cortical and trabecular bone mineral content, and density. Histomorphometric analyses at secondary spongiosa of the femur and at metaphysis of the L4 vertebra confirmed that male transgenic mice had decreased trabecular surface, reduced percentage of trabecular area, decreased trabecular number, increased trabecular separation, and increased osteoclast number per bone surface length. Consistent with an increase in bone resorption, the serum C-telopeptide level was 25% higher in transgenic mice than in wild-type littermates. However, the bone phenotype was not readily observed in female young adult transgenic mice. This could in part be due to potential interactions between estrogen and PTP-oc signaling, since the bone loss phenotype was seen in young adult ovariectomized transgenic mice by microcomputed tomography analysis. In vitro, the average pit area per resorption pit created by marrow-derived transgenic osteoclasts was approximately 50% greater than that created by wild-type osteoclasts. Transgenic osteoclasts showed a lower c-Src phosphotyrosine 527 level, greater c-Src kinase activity, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. In summary, this study provides compelling in vivo evidence that PTP-oc is a positive regulator of osteoclasts."
https://openalex.org/W2004032916,"Background Telomerase, which is active early in development and later in stem and germline cells, is also active in the majority of human cancers. One of the known functions of telomerase is to extend the ends of linear chromosomes, countering their gradual shortening at each cell division due to the end replication problem and postreplication processing. Telomerase concentration levels vary between different cell types as well as between different tumors. In addition variable telomerase concentrations will exist in different cells in the same tumor when telomerase inhibitors are used, because of limitations of drug delivery in tissue. Telomerase extends short telomeres more frequently than long telomeres and the relation between the extension frequency and the telomere length is nonlinear. Methodolgy/Principal Findings Here, the biological data of the nonlinear telomerase-telomere dynamics is incorporated in a mathematical theory to relate the proliferative potential of a cell to the telomerase concentration in that cell. The main result of the paper is that the proliferative capacity of a cell grows exponentially with the telomerase concentration. Conclusions/Significance The theory presented here suggests that long term telomerase inhibition in every cancer progenitor or cancer stem cell is needed for successful telomere targeted cancer treatment. This theory also can be used to plan and asses the results of clinical trials targeting telomerase."
https://openalex.org/W2019333745,"Gating of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels (BK or maxi-K channels) is controlled by a Ca(2+)-sensor, formed by the channel cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, and a voltage sensor, formed by its S0-S4 transmembrane helices. Here we analyze structural properties of a portion of the BK channel voltage sensing domain, the S3-S4 linker, using fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy. Single residues in the S3-S4 linker region were substituted with cysteine, and the cysteine-substituted mutants were expressed in CHO cells and covalently labeled with the sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophore monobromo-trimethylammonio-bimane (qBBr). qBBr fluorescence is quenched by tryptophan and, to a lesser extent, tyrosine side chains. We found that qBBr fluorescence in several of the labeled cysteine-substituted channels shows position-specific quenching, as indicated by increase of the brief lifetime component of the qBBr fluorescence decay. Quenching was reduced with the mutation W203F (in the S4 segment), suggesting that Trp-203 acts as a quenching group. Our results suggest a working hypothesis for the secondary structure of the BK channel S3-S4 region, and places residues Leu-204, Gly-205, and Leu-206 within the extracellular end of the S4 helix."
https://openalex.org/W2070566205,"Susceptibility or resistance to infection with Cryptosporidium parvum (C.parvum) correlates with Selenium (Se) deficiency in response to infection. Both adult Se-adequate and Se-deficient mouse models of cryptosporidiosis were used to study the cell-mediated immune response during the course of C. parvum infection.Blood samples from mouse models were used for Se status. The concentration of MDA, SOD, GPx and CAT in blood has revealed that lower Se level exist in Se-deficient mice. Mesenteric lymph node (MLN) lymphocytes from both mouse models were proliferated after ex vivo re-stimulation with C. parvum sporozoite antigen. The study of the cytokine profiles from the supernatant of proliferated MLN cells revealed that Se-adequate mice produced higher levels of Th1 (IFN-gamma and IL-2) and moderate amounts of Th2 (IL-4) cytokines throughout the course of infection. Whereas, MLN cells from Se-deficient mice produced lower levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-4 cytokines. The counts of total white cell and CD3, CD4, CD8 cell in Se-adequate were higher than that in Se-deficient mice.These results suggest that Cell immunity is affected by Se status after infection with C. parvum from kinetic changes of different white cells and cytokine. In conclusion, induced susceptibility of host is associated with an impaired antioxidant system following infection with C. parvum in C57BL/6 Selenium deficient mice."
https://openalex.org/W2045444070,"Apoptosis is a highly organized, energy-dependent program by which multicellular organisms eliminate damaged, superfluous, and potentially harmful cells. Although caspases are the most prominent group of proteases involved in the apoptotic process, the role of lysosomes has only recently been unmasked. This study investigated the role of the lysosomal serine protease CLN2 in apoptosis. We report that cells isolated from patients affected with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) having a deficient activity of CLN2 are resistant to the toxic effect of death ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), CD95 ligand, or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) but not to receptor-independent stress agents. CLN2-deficient cells exhibited a defect in TNF-induced Bid cleavage, release of cytochrome c, and caspase-9 and -3 activation. Moreover, extracts from CLN2-overexpressing cells or a CLN2 recombinant protein were able to catalyze the in vitro cleavage of Bid. Noteworthy, correction of the lysosomal enzyme defect of LINCL fibroblasts using a medium enriched in CLN2 protein enabled restoration of TNF-induced Bid and caspase-3 processing and toxicity. Conversely, transfection of CLN2-corrected cells with small interfering RNA targeting Bid abrogated TNF-induced cell death. Altogether, our study demonstrates that genetic deletion of the lysosomal serine protease CLN2 and the subsequent loss of its catalytic function confer resistance to TNF in non-neuronal somatic cells, indicating that CLN2 plays a yet unsuspected role in TNF-induced cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2076807190,"Streptococcus agalactiae is a well-known pathogen for neonates and immunocompromized adults. Beyond the neonatal period, S. agalactiae is rarely found in the respiratory tract. During 2002–2008 we noticed S. agalactiae in respiratory secretions of 30/185 (16%) of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The median age of these patients was 3–6 years older than the median age CF patients not harboring S. agalactiae. To analyze, if the S. agalactiae isolates from CF patients were clonal, further characterization of the strains was achieved by capsular serotyping, surface protein determination and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). We found a variety of sequence types (ST) among the isolates, which did not substantially differ from the MLST patterns of colonizing strains from Germany. However serotype III, which is often seen in colonizing strains and invasive infections was rare among CF patients. The emergence of S. agalactiae in the respiratory tract of CF patients may represent the adaptation to a novel host environment, supported by the altered surfactant composition in older CF patients."
https://openalex.org/W2172126636,"Background Case management guidelines use a limited set of clinical features to guide assessment and treatment for common childhood diseases in poor countries. Using video records of clinical signs we assessed agreement among experts and assessed whether Kenyan health workers could identify signs defined by expert consensus. Methodology 104 videos representing 11 clinical sign categories were presented to experts using a web questionnaire. Proportionate agreement and agreement beyond chance were calculated using kappa and the AC1 statistic. 31 videos were selected and presented to local health workers, 20 for which experts had demonstrated clear agreement and 11 for which experts could not demonstrate agreement. Principal Findings Experts reached very high level of chance adjusted agreement for some videos while for a few videos no agreement beyond chance was found. Where experts agreed Kenyan hospital staff of all cadres recognised signs with high mean sensitivity and specificity (sensitivity: 0.897–0.975, specificity: 0.813–0.894); years of experience, gender and hospital had no influence on mean sensitivity or specificity. Local health workers did not agree on videos where experts had low or no agreement. Results of different agreement statistics for multiple observers, the AC1 and Fleiss' kappa, differ across the range of proportionate agreement. Conclusion Videos provide a useful means to test agreement amongst geographically diverse groups of health workers. Kenyan health workers are in agreement with experts where clinical signs are clear-cut supporting the potential value of assessment and management guidelines. However, clinical signs are not always clear-cut. Video recordings offer one means to help standardise interpretation of clinical signs."
