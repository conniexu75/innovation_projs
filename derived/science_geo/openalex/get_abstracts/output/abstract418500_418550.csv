The authors show that sensitivity to pro-differentiation drugs such as ATRA can be induced by co-treatment with epigenetic drugs. An inhibitor of histone demethylase, LSD1, safely used as an antidepressant in humans, reprograms AML cells and makes them sensitive to the effects of ATRA in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that epigenetic interventions can increase response to cancer treatments. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a cytogenetically distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), characterized by the t(15;17)-associated PML-RARA fusion, has been successfully treated with therapy utilizing all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) to differentiate leukemic blasts. However, among patients with non-APL AML, ATRA-based treatment has not been effective. Here we show that, through epigenetic reprogramming, inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also called KDM1A), including tranylcypromine (TCP), unlocked the ATRA-driven therapeutic response in non-APL AML. LSD1 inhibition did not lead to a large-scale increase in histone 3 Lys4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) across the genome, but it did increase H3K4me2 and expression of myeloid-differentiation–associated genes. Notably, treatment with ATRA plus TCP markedly diminished the engraftment of primary human AML cells in vivo in nonobese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, suggesting that ATRA in combination with TCP may target leukemia-initiating cells. Furthermore, initiation of ATRA plus TCP treatment 15 d after engraftment of human AML cells in NOD-SCID γ (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor γ chain deficiency) mice also revealed the ATRA plus TCP drug combination to have a potent anti-leukemic effect that was superior to treatment with either drug alone. These data identify LSD1 as a therapeutic target and strongly suggest that it may contribute to AML pathogenesis by inhibiting the normal pro-differentiative function of ATRA, paving the way for new combinatorial therapies for AML."

In this study, we found that exposing juvenile male rats to repeated stress significantly impaired the temporal order recognition memory, a cognitive process controlled by the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Concomitantly, significantly reduced AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission and glutamate receptor expression were found in PFC pyramidal neurons from repeatedly stressed animals. All these effects relied on activation of glucocorticoid receptors and the subsequent enhancement of ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of GluR1 and NR1 subunits, which was controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 and Fbx2, respectively. Inhibition of proteasomes or knockdown of Nedd4-1 and Fbx2 in PFC prevented the loss of glutamatergic responses and recognition memory in stressed animals. Our results suggest that repeated stress dampens PFC glutamatergic transmission by facilitating glutamate receptor turnover, which causes the detrimental effect on PFC-dependent cognitive processes.

Repeated stress impairs PFC-dependent recognition memory Repeated stress depresses PFC glutamatergic transmission in juvenile male rats Repeated stress increases GluR1 and NR1 ubiquitination and degradation in PFC Nedd4 and Fbx2 are the E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in the stress effects in PFC Adrenal corticosterone, the major stress hormone, through the activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), can induce long-lasting influences on cognitive and emotional processes (McEwen, 2007McEwen B.S. Physiology and neurobiology of stress and adaptation: central role of the brain.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 873-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that inappropriate stress responses act as a trigger for many mental illnesses (de Kloet et al., 2005de Kloet E.R. Joëls M. Holsboer F. Stress and the brain: from adaptation to disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3318) Google Scholar). For example, depression is associated with hypercortisolaemia (excessive cortisol; Holsboer, 2000Holsboer F. The corticosteroid receptor hypothesis of depression.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: 477-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar, van Praag, 2004van Praag H.M.

Post-traumatic stress disorder.N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Thus, corticosteroid hormones are thought to serve as a key controller for adaptation and maintenance of homeostasis in situations of acute stress, as well as maladaptive changes in response to chronic and repeated stress that lead to cognitive and emotional disturbances symptomatic of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders (Newport and Nemeroff, 2000Newport D.J.

One of the primary targets of stress hormones is the prefrontal cortex (McEwen, 2007McEwen B.S. Physiology and neurobiology of stress and adaptation: central role of the brain.Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 873-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar), a region controlling high-level “executive” functions, including working memory, inhibition of distraction, novelty seeking, and decision making (Miller, 1999Miller E.K.

Chronic stress or glucocorticoid treatment has been found to cause structural remodeling and behavioral alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from adult animals, such as dendritic shortening, spine loss, and neuronal atrophy (Cook and Wellman, 2004Cook S.C.

However, little is known about the physiological consequences and molecular targets of long-term stress in PFC, especially during the adolescent period when the brain is more sensitive to stressors (Lupien et al., 2009Lupien S.J. McEwen B.S. Gunnar M.R. Heim C. Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3862) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission that controls PFC neuronal activity is crucial for working memory (Goldman-Rakic, 1995Goldman-Rakic P.S. Cellular basis of working memory.Neuron. 1995; 14: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar, Lisman et al., 1998Lisman J.E. Fellous J.M. Wang X.J. A role for NMDA-receptor channels in working memory.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have found that acute stress induces a sustained potentiation of glutamate receptor membrane trafficking and glutamatergic transmission in rat PFC (Yuen et al., 2009Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Acute stress enhances glutamatergic transmission in prefrontal cortex and facilitates working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Psychiatry. 2011; 16: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), providing a molecular and cellular mechanism for the beneficial effects of acute stress on working memory. Since dysfunction of glutamatergic transmission is considered the core feature and fundamental pathology of mental disorders (Tsai and Coyle, 2002Tsai G. Coyle J.T. Glutamatergic mechanisms in schizophrenia.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, Moghaddam, 2003Moghaddam B.

Laruelle M. The synaptic hypothesis of schizophrenia.Neuron. 2003; 39: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), in this study, we sought to determine whether repeated (subchronic) stress might negatively influence PFC-mediated cognitive processes by disturbing glutamatergic signaling in juvenile animals. To test the impact of stress on cognitive functions, we measured the recognition memory task, a fundamental explicit memory process requiring judgments of the prior occurrence of stimuli based on the relative familiarity of individual objects, the association of objects and places, or the recency information (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988Ennaceur A.

The medial frontal cortex and temporal memory: tests using spontaneous exploratory behaviour in the rat.Behav. Brain Res. 1998; 97: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Lesion studies have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex plays an obligatory role in the temporal order recognition (TOR) memory (Barker et al., 2007Barker G.R. Bird F. Alexander V. Warburton E.C. Recognition memory for objects, place, and temporal order: a disconnection analysis of the role of the medial prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2948-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) so this behavioral task was used. Young (4-week-old) male rats, who had been exposed to 7 day repeated behavioral stressors, were examined at 24 hr after stressor cessation. The control groups spent much more time exploring the novel (less recent) object in the test trial (familiar recent object: 9.9 s ± 2.4 s, novel object: 19.9 s ± 2.4 s, n = 7, p < 0.01), whereas the stressed rats (restraint, 2 hr/day, 7 day) lost the preference to the novel object (familiar recent object: 15.2 s ± 2.4 s; novel object: 11.0 s ± 2.8 s, n = 5, p > 0.05). The discrimination ratio (DR), an index of the object recognition memory, showed a significant main effect (Figure 1A , F3,24 = 9.8, p < 0.001, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Post hoc analysis indicated a profound impairment of TOR memory by repeated stress (DR in control: 36.7% ± 6.6%, n = 7; DR in stressed: −19.6% ± 3.8%, n = 5, p < 0.001), which was blocked by systemic injection of the GR antagonist RU486 (DR in RU486: 41.6% ± 9.0%, n = 6; DR in RU486+stress: 38.8% ± 11.2%, n = 7, p > 0.05). To test whether GR in the PFC mediates the detrimental effect of repeated stress on cognition, we performed stereotaxic injections of RU486, vehicle control, or corticosterone to PFC prelimbic regions bilaterally via an implanted guide cannula (Yuen et al., 2011Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Ren Y. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Mechanisms for acute stress-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission and working memory.Mol. Psychiatry. 2011; 16: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). A significant main effect was found (Figure 1B, F4,30 = 5.1, p < 0.005, ANOVA), and post hoc analysis indicated that repeated restraint stress impaired TOR memory in rats injected with vehicle (DR in veh: 38.7% ± 12.0%, n = 7; DR in veh+stress: −17.5% ± 9.1%, n = 6, p < 0.01), an effect mimicked by repeated CORT injections (0.87 nmol/g, 7 day, −10.5% ± 12.7%, n = 6, p < 0.05), whereas such impairment was prevented by RU486 delivered to PFC (1.4 nmol/g, 7 day, DR in RU486: 34.2% ± 17.8%, n = 6; DR in RU486+stress: 36.1% ± 6.1%, n = 6, p > 0.05). It suggests that repeated stress influences cognitive processes via GR activation in the PFC. Next, we examined whether other stressors could produce a similar effect. As shown in Figure 1C, rats exposed to repeated unpredictable stress (7 day) also lost the preference to the novel object in TOR memory tasks (DR in control: 40.3% ± 8.2%, n = 9; DR in stressed: −11.0% ± 8.3%, n = 9, p < 0.001). To test the specificity of this stress-induced memory deficit, we also subjected animals to the object location task, a paradigm for the PFC-independent memory (Barker et al., 2007Barker G.R. Bird F. Alexander V. Warburton E.C. Recognition memory for objects, place, and temporal order: a disconnection analysis of the role of the medial prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2948-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1D, both control groups and stressed animals (restraint, 7 day) showed similar discrimination between the object that had changed position than the object that had remained in a constant position (DR in control: 58.1% ± 5.4%, n = 6; DR in stressed: 47.7% ± 15.7%, n = 6, p > 0.05). In contrast to the impaired temporal order recognition memory, rats exposed to repeated restraint stress showed no changes in anxiety-related behavior or locomotive activity (Figure 1E), as indicated by the amount of time spent in the open-field center (control: 7.3 s ± 0.9 s; stressed: 7.3 s ± 1.5 s, n = 8 pairs, p > 0.05) and the number of midline crossing in a cage (control: 10.2 ± 1.2, stressed: 11.5 ± 1.8, n = 6 pairs, p > 0.05). To find out the onset of the detrimental effects of stress on cognition, we exposed young male rats to various days (1, 3, 5 and 7) of restraint stress. As shown in Figure 1F, TOR memory was largely unchanged by 1 or 3 day stress but was significantly impaired in animals exposed to 5 or 7 day stress (p < 0.001, n = 6 pairs per group). After 3 day withdrawal from the repeated stress, TOR memory still showed deficiency (p < 0.01, n = 6 pairs) but recovered after 5 day withdrawal (n = 6 pairs). To test whether glutamatergic transmission in PFC is critical for the object recognition memory, we gave animals a stereotaxic injection of the NMDAR antagonist APV and AMPAR antagonist CNQX to PFC prelimbic regions bilaterally. As shown in Figure 1G, APV+CNQX-injected animals lost the normal preference to the novel (less recent) object (DR in saline: 36.8% ± 10.3%, n = 7; DR in APV+CNQX: −20.4% ± 8.7%, n = 11, p < 0.001), similar to the animals exposed to repeated stress. The total exploration time in the two sample phases and the subsequent test trial was unchanged by any of these treatments (Figure S1 available online). Taken together, it suggests that repeated stress has a detrimental effect on recognition memory, which may be due to the loss of glutamatergic transmission in PFC. To find out the impact of repeated stress on glutamatergic transmission, we examined the input/output curves of AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents (EPSC) in PFC pyramidal neurons from stressed, young (4-week-old) male rats. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B, AMPAR-EPSC and NMDAR-EPSC induced by a series of stimulus intensities were markedly reduced in neurons from animals exposed to repeated (7 day) restraint stress or unpredictable stress (AMPA: 40%–60% decrease, p < 0.01, ANOVA, n = 16–29 per group; NMDA: 38%–57% decrease, p < 0.01, ANOVA, n = 19–28 per group). To test whether the reduced synaptic transmission by repeated stress may result from a presynaptic mechanism, we measured the paired pulse ratio (PPR) of AMPAR- and NMDAR-EPSC, a readout sensitive to presynaptic glutamate release. As shown in Figure 2C, PPR was not different in control versus stressed animals, suggesting a lack of gross change in presynaptic function. To further confirm the involvement of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, we measured miniature EPSC (mEPSC), a synaptic response resulting from quantal release of single glutamate vesicles, in PFC slices. As shown in Figures 2D and 2E, repeatedly stressed animals had markedly reduced mEPSC amplitude (control: 15.1 pA ± 2.1 pA, n = 8; restraint stress: 9.4 pA ± 0.3 pA, n = 7, unpredictable stress: 9.6 pA ± 0.4 pA, n = 9, F2,26 = 8.8, p < 0.01, ANOVA) and frequency (control: 3.2 Hz ± 0.3 Hz, n = 8; restraint stress: 1.4 Hz ± 0.2 Hz, n = 7, unpredictable stress: 1.9 Hz ± 0.2 Hz, n = 9, F2,23 = 15.5, p < 0.01, ANOVA). Moreover, we measured whole-cell ionic current elicited by AMPA (100 μM) or NMDA (100 μM) application in acutely dissociated PFC neurons (a pure postsynaptic preparation). As shown in Figure 2F, animals exposed to repeated restraint stress had significantly smaller AMPAR current density (pA/pF; control: 81.9 ± 6.8, n = 14; stressed: 42.9 ± 5.1, n = 14, p < 0.01) and NMDAR current density (control: 93.3 ± 4.6; stressed: 40.4 ± 4.0, n = 13; p < 0.01). In contrast, the voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) current density was not altered (control: 59.4 ± 4.9, n = 14; stressed: 63.1 ± 4.9, n = 14; p > 0.05). Systemic injections of the GR antagonist RU486 blocked the decreasing effect of repeated restraint stress on AMPAR-EPSC (Figure 2G, control: 141.3 pA ± 11.7 pA, n = 9; stressed: 147.4 pA ± 9.5 pA, n = 12, p > 0.05) and NMDAR-EPSC (Figure 2G, control: 180.2 pA ± 9.8pA, n = 10; stressed: 181.3 pA ± 8.5 pA, n = 12, p > 0.05). Local injections of RU486 to the PFC (1.4 nmol/g, 7 day) also prevented the reduction of AMPAR-EPSC by repeated stress (Figure 2H, control: 135.4 pA ± 16.9 pA, n = 8; stressed: 130.4 pA ± 9.4 pA, n = 8, p > 0.05). Repeated injections of CORT to the PFC (0.87 nmol/g, 7 day) produced a significant reduction of AMPAR-EPSC (Figure 2I, control: 141.4 pA ± 7.5 pA, n = 7; CORT: 59.4 pA ± 6.2 pA, n = 7, p < 0.01), similar to the effect of behavioral stressors. It suggests that repeated stress downregulates glutamatergic transmission via GR activation in the PFC. Our previous studies show that acute stress (e.g., a single 2 hr restraint) enhances PFC glutamatergic transmission and working memory (Yuen et al., 2009Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Acute stress enhances glutamatergic transmission in prefrontal cortex and facilitates working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14075-14079Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, Yuen et al., 2011Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Ren Y. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Mechanisms for acute stress-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission and working memory.Mol. Psychiatry. 2011; 16: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To understand the complex actions of stress hormones, we exposed animals to various days of restraint stress. As shown in Figure 2J, a bidirectional effect on AMPAR-EPSC was detected in stressed animals (F4,63 = 11.4, p < 0.01, ANOVA, n = 12–14 per group). Post hoc analysis indicated that AMPAR synaptic transmission was significantly increased by 1 day (2 hr) stress (79.6% ± 19.8% increase, p < 0.01), largely unchanged by 3 day stress (10.1% ± 9.4% increase, p > 0.05), and significantly decreased by 5 day stress (45.2% ± 3.7% decrease, p < 0.01) or 7 day stress (51.3% ± 3.1% decrease, p < 0.01). These results suggest that stress exerts a biphasic effect on PFC glutamatergic transmission depending on the duration of stressor. The onset of the impairing effect of repeated stress on glutamatergic transmission parallels that of recognition memory (Figure 1F), further suggesting the causal link between them. To test the regional specificity of the effect of repeated stress, we also examined glutamatergic transmission in striatum and hippocampus from young male rats (Figure 2K). In contrast to the significant effect in PFC (control: 168.3 pA ± 11.2 pA, n = 12; stressed: 81.8 pA ± 5.9 pA, n = 12, p < 0.01), repeated stress did not significantly alter AMPAR-EPSC in striatal medium spiny neurons (control: 142.9 pA ± 10.6 pA, n = 11; stressed: 149.9 pA ± 10.1 pA, n = 11, p > 0.05) or CA1 pyramidal neurons (control: 142.4 pA ± 10.3 pA, n = 10; stressed: 150.2 pA ± 9.4 pA, n = 10, p > 0.05). The suppression of glutamatergic transmission by repeated stress could result from the reduced number of glutamate receptors. To test this, we performed western blotting and surface biotinylation experiments to detect the total and surface levels of AMPAR and NMDAR subunits in PFC slices from stressed, young (4-week-old) male rats. As shown in Figure 3A , animals exposed to acute restraint stress (single time, 2 hr) showed a significant increase in surface AMPAR and NMDAR subunits (35%–86% increase; n = 4 pairs, p < 0.01), whereas the total proteins remained unchanged, consistent with our previous findings (Yuen et al., 2009Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Acute stress enhances glutamatergic transmission in prefrontal cortex and facilitates working memory.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 14075-14079Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, Yuen et al., 2011Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Ren Y. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Mechanisms for acute stress-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission and working memory.Mol. Psychiatry. 2011; 16: 156-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Animals exposed to 3 day restraint stress showed no difference (n = 4 pairs). Animals exposed to 5 or 7 day restraint stress showed a significant decrease in the amount of GluR1 and NR1 subunits (Figure 3C, GluR1: 45%–51% decrease, NR1: 55%–63% decrease, n = 21 pairs, p < 0.01). Moreover, repeated stress did not affect the total level of other glutamate receptor subunits (Figure 3B), such as GluR2, NR2A, and NR2B (n = 16 pairs), or the expression of MAP2 (a dendritic marker), synapsin, synaptophysin (presynaptic markers), or PSD-95 (a postsynaptic marker, n = 10 pairs), suggesting that no general dendritic or synaptic loss has occurred under such conditions. The amount of AMPAR and NMDAR subunits in the surface pool was all significantly decreased by repeated stress (Figure 3C, surface GluR1/2: 62%–70% decrease, surface NR1/2A/2B: 55%–70% decrease, n = 6 pairs, p < 0.01), indicating the loss of glutamate receptors at the plasma membrane. To find out how long the effect of repeated stress can last, we exposed young animals to 7 day restraint stress and examined them at 3–5 days after stressor cessation. As shown in Figures 3A and 3C, after 3 day withdrawal of stress, the expression of total and surface AMPARs and NMDARs was still at a partially reduced level (total GluR1: ∼39% decrease, total NR1: ∼27% decrease, surface GluR1/2: 60%–62% decrease, surface NR1/2A/2B: 40%–55% decrease, n = 3 pairs, p < 0.01) but returned to the control level after 5 day withdrawal (n = 3 pairs). Injecting the GR antagonist RU486 abolished the decreasing effects of repeated restraint stress on total GluR1, total NR1, surface GluR1/2 and surface NR1/2A/2B (Figures 3D and 3E, n = 3 pairs). It suggests that repeated stress downregulates glutamate receptor expression via GR activation. In contrast to the significant reduction of total GluR1 and NR1 expression in PFC by repeated restraint stress (Figure 3F, GluR1: ∼52% of control; NR1: ∼51% of control, p < 0.01), no significant changes were found in other brain areas, including striatum and hippocampus (Figure 3F, striatum: GluR1: ∼108% of control; NR1: ∼110% of control; hippocampus: GluR1: ∼103% of control; NR1: 93% of control, n = 3–5 pairs, p > 0.05), confirming the region specificity of stress effects. Similar to restraint stress, young male rats exposed to repeated unpredictable stress (7-day) also had significantly reduced levels of total GluR1 and NR1, as well as surface AMPAR and NMDAR subunits in PFC (Figure S2). Since stress hormones elicit distinct effects throughout the lifespan (Lupien et al., 2009Lupien S.J. McEwen B.S. Gunnar M.R. Heim C. Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 434-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3862) Google Scholar), we also examined older animals. As shown in Figure S3, adult (7-week-old) male rats, who had been exposed to 7 day repeated restraint or unpredictable stress, had normal levels of total and surface AMPAR and NMDAR subunits in the PFC. It suggests that the loss of PFC glutamate receptors induced by one-week repeated stress is a phenomenon specifically occurring in the adolescent period. We next examined whether the effect of repeated stress in vivo may be mimicked by corticosterone (CORT) application in vitro. To do so, we treated PFC cultures with different durations and doses of CORT and examined mEPSC. As shown in Figure 4A , mEPSC amplitude was bidirectionally changed in response to short- or long-term CORT (100 nM) treatment (F9,99 = 21.0, p < 0.001, ANOVA, n = 5–14 per group). Post hoc analysis indicated that acute CORT treatment significantly increased mEPSC amplitude (DIV21 control: 25.0 pA ± 1.3 pA; 1 hr CORT: 38.5 pA ± 3.9 pA; 4 hr CORT: 42.4 pA ± 2.5 pA; 1 day CORT: 44.2 pA ± 3.3 pA, p < 0.01), similar to previous findings (Yuen et al., 2011Yuen E.Y. Liu W. Karatsoreos I.N. Ren Y. Feng J. McEwen B.S. Yan Z. Mechanisms for acute stress-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission and working memory.Mol.

Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 6101-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), whereas a significant decrease was found with prolonged CORT treatment (DIV26 control: 32.6 pA ± 2.7 pA; 5 day CORT: 16.3 pA ± 0.9 pA; 7 day CORT: 15.4 pA ± 0.5 pA; p < 0.01). Dose response studies (Figure 4B) indicated that different doses of CORT treatment (7 day) had different effects on mEPSC (amplitude: F4,42 = 15.3, p < 0.01, frequency: F4,36 = 13.0, p < 0.05, ANOVA, n = 7–10 per group), with a small reducing effect at 10 nM and a saturated reducing effect at 100–200 nM. The effect of CORT (100 nM, 7 day) on mEPSC was lost in neurons incubated with RU486 (10 μM, Figures 4C and 4D, RU486: 31 pA ±3.1 pA, 12.1 Hz ± 0.8 Hz, n = 7; RU486+CORT: 32.4 ± 4.9 pA, 11.3 ± 0.98 Hz, n = 9, p > 0.05) but not the MR antagonist RU28318 (10 μM, RU28318: 33.3 pA ± 4.7 pA, 11.8 Hz ± 1.3 Hz, n = 7; RU28318+CORT: 22.9 pA ± 1.4 pA, 7.4 Hz ± 1.4 Hz, n = 9, p < 0.05), suggesting that GR mediates the effect of chronic CORT treatment. To test whether the CORT-induced reduction of mEPSC was due to the decreased number of AMPARs at synapses, we performed immunocytochemical experiments to measure the cluster density (# clusters/50 μm dendrite) of total GluR1 and synaptic GluR1 (colocalized with the synaptic marker PSD-95) in PFC cultures. As shown in Figures 4E and 4F, CORT treatment (100 nM, 7 day) significantly reduced total GluR1 cluster density (control: 26.6 ± 3.1, n = 14; CORT: 15.6 ± 1.3, n = 12, p < 0.01) and synaptic GluR1 cluster density (control: 14.0 ± 1.0, n = 11; CORT: 7.8 ± 0.7, n = 12, p < 0.01). Taken together, these results suggest that, similar to in vivo repeated stress, prolonged in vitro CORT treatment also reduces AMPAR expression and function through GR activation. Since the total level of NR1 and GluR1 was reduced in repeatedly stressed animals, we examined whether it could be due to the decreased synthesis or increased degradation of glutamate receptors. As shown in Figure S4, repeated stress did not significantly alter the mRNA level of AMPAR and NMDAR subunits, suggesting that protein synthesis is intact. Thus, the reducing effect of repeated stress on NR1 and GluR1 expression may be due to the"

The Nogo receptor family members NgR1 and NgR2 bind to MAIs and have been implicated in neuronal inhibition. We found that NgR1 and NgR3 bind with high affinity to the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans and participate in CSPG inhibition in cultured neurons. Nogo receptor triple mutants (Ngr1(-/-); Ngr2(-/-); Ngr3(-/-); which are also known as Rtn4r, Rtn4rl2 and Rtn4rl1, respectively), but not single mutants, showed enhanced axonal regeneration following retro-orbital optic nerve crush injury. The combined loss of Ngr1 and Ngr3 (Ngr1(-/-); Ngr3(-/-)), but not Ngr1 and Ngr2 (Ngr1(-/-); Ngr2(-/-)), was sufficient to mimic the triple mutant regeneration phenotype. Regeneration in Ngr1(-/-); Ngr3(-/-) mice was further enhanced by simultaneous ablation of Rptpσ (also known as Ptprs), a known CSPG receptor. Collectively, our results identify NgR1 and NgR3 as CSPG receptors, suggest that there is functional redundancy among CSPG receptors, and provide evidence for shared mechanisms of MAI and CSPG inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2120419610,"Simon Harris and colleagues report whole-genome sequencing of 36 Chlamydia trachomatis representative strains from temporally and geographically diverse sources and use this to construct a genome-wide phylogeny of the species. They find that epidemic spread can be driven by clonal expansion from a single source and also report evidence for recombination in recent clinical strains both within and between biovars. Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for both trachoma and sexually transmitted infections, causing substantial morbidity and economic cost globally. Despite this, our knowledge of its population and evolutionary genetics is limited. Here we present a detailed phylogeny based on whole-genome sequencing of representative strains of C. trachomatis from both trachoma and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovars from temporally and geographically diverse sources. Our analysis shows that predicting phylogenetic structure using ompA, which is traditionally used to classify Chlamydia, is misleading because extensive recombination in this region masks any true relationships present. We show that in many instances, ompA is a chimera that can be exchanged in part or as a whole both within and between biovars. We also provide evidence for exchange of, and recombination within, the cryptic plasmid, which is another key diagnostic target. We used our phylogenetic framework to show how genetic exchange has manifested itself in ocular, urogenital and LGV C. trachomatis strains, including the epidemic LGV serotype L2b."
https://openalex.org/W1999696971,"Investigations of the underlying mechanisms of choice in humans have focused on learning from prediction errors, leaving the computational structure of value based planning comparatively underexplored. Using behavioral and neuroimaging analyses of a minimax decision task, we found that the computational processes underlying forward planning are expressed in the anterior caudate nucleus as values of individual branching steps in a decision tree. In contrast, values represented in the putamen pertain solely to values learned during extensive training. During actual choice, both striatal areas showed a functional coupling to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, consistent with this region acting as a value comparator. Our findings point toward an architecture of choice in which segregated value systems operate in parallel in the striatum for planning and extensively trained choices, with medial prefrontal cortex integrating their outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2055420785,"Human social exchange is often characterized by conflicts of interest requiring strategic behavior for their resolution. To investigate the development of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying strategic behavior, we studied children's decisions while they played two types of economic exchange games with differing demands of strategic behavior. We show an increase of strategic behavior with age, which could not be explained by age-related changes in social preferences but instead by developmental differences in impulsivity and associated brain functions of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, observed differences in cortical thickness of lDLPFC were predictive of differences in impulsivity and strategic behavior irrespective of age. We conclude that egoistic behavior in younger children is not caused by a lack of understanding right or wrong, but by the inability to implement behavioral control when tempted to act selfishly; a function relying on brain regions maturing only late in ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1984875318,"Latrophilins (LPHNs) are a small family of G protein-coupled receptors known to mediate the massive synaptic exocytosis caused by the black widow spider venom α-latrotoxin, but their endogenous ligands and function remain unclear. Mutations in LPHN3 are strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, suggesting a role for latrophilins in human cognitive function. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identify the FLRT family of leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins as endogenous postsynaptic ligands for latrophilins. We demonstrate that the FLRT3 and LPHN3 ectodomains interact with high affinity in trans and that interference with this interaction using soluble recombinant LPHN3, LPHN3 shRNA, or FLRT3 shRNA reduces excitatory synapse density in cultured neurons. In addition, reducing FLRT3 levels with shRNA in vivo decreases afferent input strength and dendritic spine number in dentate granule cells. These observations indicate that LPHN3 and its ligand FLRT3 play an important role in glutamatergic synapse development."
https://openalex.org/W1987200107,"The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem that has coevolved with host physiology. Colonization of germ-free (GF) mice with a microbiota promotes increased vessel density in the small intestine, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Tissue factor (TF) is the membrane receptor that initiates the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and it promotes developmental and tumour angiogenesis. Here we show that the gut microbiota promotes TF glycosylation associated with localization of TF on the cell surface, the activation of coagulation proteases, and phosphorylation of the TF cytoplasmic domain in the small intestine. Anti-TF treatment of colonized GF mice decreased microbiota-induced vascular remodelling and expression of the proangiogenic factor angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) in the small intestine. Mice with a genetic deletion of the TF cytoplasmic domain or with hypomorphic TF (F3) alleles had a decreased intestinal vessel density. Coagulation proteases downstream of TF activate protease-activated receptor (PAR) signalling implicated in angiogenesis. Vessel density and phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of TF were decreased in small intestine from PAR1-deficient (F2r(-/-)) but not PAR2-deficient (F2rl1(-/-)) mice, and inhibition of thrombin showed that thrombin-PAR1 signalling was upstream of TF phosphorylation. Thus, the microbiota-induced extravascular TF-PAR1 signalling loop is a novel pathway that may be modulated to influence vascular remodelling in the small intestine."

https://openalex.org/W2043184385,"The related transmembrane proteins MEGF10 and MEGF11 are shown to have critical roles in the formation of mosaic arrangements in the retina. In the retina and other nerve tissues, neural interactions are facilitated by the arrangement of the neurons in regular patterns. This paper addresses how these patterns emerge during development. Kay et al. show that in the mouse retina, where neurons of individual subtypes form arrays called mosaics, the related transmembrane proteins MEGF10 and MEGF11 are required for the formation of mosaics by starburst amacrine cells and horizontal cells. Like the related proteins CED-1 and Draper, from Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila respectively, MEGF10 and MEGF11 have until now been studied predominantly as receptors for cell engulfment. In many parts of the nervous system, neuronal somata display orderly spatial arrangements1. In the retina, neurons of numerous individual subtypes form regular arrays called mosaics: they are less likely to be near neighbours of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in ‘exclusion zones’ that separate them1,2,3,4. Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements2. Remarkably, mosaics are independent of each other: although a neuron of one subtype is unlikely to be adjacent to another of the same subtype, there is no restriction on its spatial relationship to neighbouring neurons of other subtypes5. This independence has led to the hypothesis that molecular cues expressed by specific subtypes pattern mosaics by mediating homotypic (within-subtype) short-range repulsive interactions1,4,5,6,7,8,9. So far, however, no molecules have been identified that show such activity, so this hypothesis remains untested. Here we demonstrate in mouse that two related transmembrane proteins, MEGF10 and MEGF11, have critical roles in the formation of mosaics by two retinal interneuron subtypes, starburst amacrine cells and horizontal cells. MEGF10 and 11 and their invertebrate relatives Caenorhabditis elegans CED-1 and Drosophila Draper have hitherto been studied primarily as receptors necessary for engulfment of debris following apoptosis or axonal injury10,11,12,13,14. Our results demonstrate that members of this gene family can also serve as subtype-specific ligands that pattern neuronal arrays."

https://openalex.org/W1998127228,"Neurons encode information by firing spikes in isolation or bursts and propagate information by spike-triggered neurotransmitter release that initiates synaptic transmission. Isolated spikes trigger neurotransmitter release unreliably but with high temporal precision. In contrast, bursts of spikes trigger neurotransmission reliably (i.e., boost transmission fidelity), but the resulting synaptic responses are temporally imprecise. However, the relative physiological importance of different spike-firing modes remains unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of synaptotagmin-1, the major Ca2+ sensor for neurotransmitter release, abrogated neurotransmission evoked by isolated spikes but only delayed, without abolishing, neurotransmission evoked by bursts of spikes. Nevertheless, knockdown of synaptotagmin-1 in the hippocampal CA1 region did not impede acquisition of recent contextual fear memories, although it did impair the precision of such memories. In contrast, knockdown of synaptotagmin-1 in the prefrontal cortex impaired all remote fear memories. These results indicate that different brain circuits and types of memory employ distinct spike-coding schemes to encode and transmit information."
https://openalex.org/W2060090147,"The positioning of neurons in the cerebral cortex is of crucial importance for its function as highlighted by the severe consequences of migrational disorders in patients. Here we show that genetic deletion of the small GTPase RhoA in the developing cerebral cortex results in two migrational disorders: subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), a heterotopic cortex underlying the normotopic cortex, and cobblestone lissencephaly, in which neurons protrude beyond layer I at the pial surface of the brain. Surprisingly, RhoA−/− neurons migrated normally when transplanted into wild-type cerebral cortex, whereas the converse was not the case. Alterations in the radial glia scaffold are demonstrated to cause these migrational defects through destabilization of both the actin and the microtubules cytoskeleton. These data not only demonstrate that RhoA is largely dispensable for migration in neurons but also showed that defects in radial glial cells, rather than neurons, can be sufficient to produce SBH.

RhoA regulates radial glial morphology RhoA depletion results in formation of a double cortex RhoA deletion affects stability of actin but less of microtubules in neurons RhoA is critical for glial guided neuronal migration A hallmark of the mammalian neocortex is the arrangement of functionally distinct neurons in six horizontal layers, which possess distinct properties in different sensory or motor areas (Leone et al., 2008Leone D.P.

The importance of this arrangement is revealed when it is disturbed, such as in patients with brain malformations, which are largely composed of neuronal dysplasia in the cerebral cortex (Bielas et al., 2004Bielas S.

One group of malformations, periventricular heterotopia (PH), results in cortical gray matter (GM) of varying size located at the ventricular margin. These defects can be associated with epilepsy and mental retardation (Guerrini and Parrini, 2010Guerrini R. Parrini E. Neuronal migration disorders.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 38: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). While PH is clinically heterogeneous and also exhibits locus heterogeneity, most of the X-linked cases are due to mutations in a gene encoding the F-actin binding phosphoprotein Filamin A (Guerrini and Parrini, 2010Guerrini R. Parrini E. Neuronal migration disorders.Neurobiol. Dis. 2010; 38: 154-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, Robertson, 2004Robertson S.P. Molecular pathology of filamin A: diverse phenotypes, many functions.Clin. Dysmorphol. 2004; 13: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A second group of neuronal migration disorders consists of mutations in genes encoding microtubule (MT)-associated proteins, like Doublecortin (DCX) and Lissencephaly-1 (LIS1), resulting in partial or incomplete migration of neurons to their cortical locations during development (Bielas et al., 2004Bielas S. Higginbotham H. Koizumi H. Tanaka T. Gleeson J.G. Cortical neuronal migration mutants suggest separate but intersecting pathways.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Mutations at these loci can result in a “double cortex,” a malformation which is distinct from PH in that the heterotopic GM is interposed between zones of white matter (WM), resulting in so-called subcortical band heterotopia (SBH). However, genetic inactivations of the murine homologs of genes mutated in human neuronal migration disorders so far have failed to reproduce these malformations, prompting the suggestion that mutations at other as-yet-unrecognized loci may result in SBH (Bilasy et al., 2009Bilasy S.E.

These discrepancies highlight the complexity of human cerebral cortex in comparison to rodents. Not only do migrating neurons have to cover a much longer distance to their final destination, they also need to change radial guides more often due to the increase in pial surface compared to the ventricular surface with additional radial glia (RG) in the outer SVZ (Fietz et al., 2010Fietz S.A.

Thus, migrating neurons in human cerebral cortex may require other pathways as they face additional challenges during their journey. Moreover, radial glial cells may need specific pathways, which are yet ill-understood in the mouse model. Indeed, so far only mutation of MEKK4 has been suggested to affect migrating neurons and radial glial cells, causing disruption of the ventricular surface and protrusions of neuronal ectopia into the ventricle (Sarkisian et al., 2006Sarkisian M.R.

Here we set out to examine the role of the small GTPase RhoA for neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex, as RhoA had been suggested to play key roles in directed cell migration in various tissues and organs (Govek et al., 2005Govek E.E.

However, the direct role of RhoA in neuronal migration has never been tested in the developing nervous system in vivo.

We therefore set out here to delete RhoA in the brain region mostly affected by migrational disorders, namely, the cerebral cortex. In order to determine the role of RhoA in neuronal migration during the development of the cerebral cortex, the Emx1::Cre mouse line driving recombination at early stages selectively in this region (Cappello et al., 2006Cappello S.

Cell. 2011; 22: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Emx1::Cre/RhoAfl/fl mice (henceforth referred to as cKO) were born at expected numbers, survived to adulthood, and exhibited no gross behavioral abnormalities. However, histological examination of their cerebral cortex revealed a striking phenotype, with a prominent tissue mass underneath an apparently layered but thinner cerebral cortex (Figures 1A and 1B; see Figure S1 available online). This heterotopic tissue was largely composed of NeuN+ neurons and exceeded the normotopic cortex (NC) in width within the occipital lobes (Figures 1A and 1B). To determine whether the heterotopic accumulation of neurons corresponds to the PH or SBH type, we stained for glial cells, as neurons are located directly at the ependymal lining of the ventricle in PH, while glial cells delineate neurons from the ventricle in SBH. Immunostaining for myelin proteins, such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG; Figure 1C), labels the WM in WT cerebral cortex, and glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity also labels fibrous astrocytes within and subependymal astrocytes below the WM (Figure 1D). Interestingly, both GFAP and MAG label two horizontal bands in the cerebral cortex of cKO mice (Figures 1E–1H): an upper band below the NC but above the heterotopic cortex (HC; Figures 1E and 1F), which is also visible as a zone free of neuronal nuclei (Figure 1B) and a lower horizontal band at the ventricle (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, ectopic neurons are embedded within the WM and not directly apposed to the ventricle, defining this malformation as a form of SBH. In addition, NeuN+ neuron clusters were also located in and even beyond the normally cell sparse layer 1 (Figure 1B, arrow, data not shown) at patches of basement membrane (BM) disruptions (Figures S7M and S7N), a migrational disorder referred to as type II cobblestone lissencephaly. Thus, conditional deletion of RhoA results in two migrational disorders. In order to characterize the neuronal composition of the two cortices in the cKO mice, we first examined morphology and the polarity of neurons in the adult normotopic and heterotopic cortices. We performed in vivo injection of a spread-deficient G-pseudotyped rabies virus, in which the glycoprotein (G) was replaced by eGFP, in different layers of the adult WT and mutant cerebral cortex labeling individual neurons with a Golgi-like resolution. Analysis of neurons labeled in the upper normotopic cortex revealed a pyramidal neuron morphology with a dominant apically directed main dendrite reminiscent of normal pyramidal neurons (Figures S2A–S2D), as well as clearly distinct dendrites and a single axon (Figures S2A′–S2D′). Notably, we could trace some axons toward the callosum consistent with a correct morphological development of the respective labeled neurons and of their axonal projections (data not shown). Likewise, neurons in the SBH also exhibited clear axon-dendrite polarity, and some also had a pyramidal-like morphology, often inverted with the apical dendrite oriented toward the ventricle (Figures S2E–S2F′). We could also observe projections of neurons present in the SBH within both the upper and lower white matter (data not shown), suggesting that neurons in the NC and HC develop a grossly normal dendrite-axon polarity. Neuronal subtypes in the cerebral cortex differ in regard to their layer and area position. We therefore first examined the laminar identity of the heterotopic neurons by immunodetection of sub-type-specific transcription factors, Cux1 for layers II/III and IV, Satb2 for layers II/III and V, Ctip2 and Fezf2 for layers V and VI, and Tbr1 and Tle4 for layer VI. Neurons expressing these markers were arranged in the normal layered pattern in the NC in both WT and cKO mice. Interestingly, all of these markers were also observed in the SBH (Figures 1I–1L; Figure S3). However, most neurons in the HC/SBH were Cux1+, indicating a primarily upper-layer identity, while the number of Cux1+ neurons within the NC accordingly reduced (Figures 1K, 1L, and S3A). Interestingly, neurons expressing deep-layer markers (Fezf2, Ctip2, and Tle4) were often at the periphery of the SBH, while Cux1+ and Satb2+ neurons were localized in the core (Figures S3B–3SL), suggesting a concentric organization of neurons of different identities in the SBH by postnatal day (P)8 (Figures S3B–S3G). This organization was further confirmed by immunolabelling of the thalamo-cortical synapses positive for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT-2; Coleman et al., 2010Coleman J.E. Nahmani M. Gavornik J.P. Haslinger R. Heynen A.J. Erisir A. Bear M.F. Rapid structural remodeling of thalamocortical synapses parallels experience-dependent functional plasticity in mouse primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 9670-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Figure S5C), revealing a series of blobs and stripes in the SBH of cKO mice (Figure S5C) supporting its nonlaminar organization. Moreover, a main stripe supposedly corresponding to layer 4 receiving these afferent fibers was also visible in the cKO NC but shifted upwards. Thus, neurons of all layers were present with a bias toward upper-layer neurons in the HC organized in a ring-like structure. Deep-layer neurons (Tbr1+, Ctip2+) are normally generated first, and upper-layer neurons (Cux1+, Satb2+) are generated later during development. To examine this sequence in the cKO cerebral cortex, the DNA base analog BrdU was injected at E12, E14, and E16, and the distribution of BrdU+ cells was examined at P7. We found cells born at all three stages in both NC and HC, with earlier generated neurons located at deeper positions in the NC as in the WT (Figure S4). Only few neurons generated at early stages (E12; Figures S4A and S4B) were detected in the HC, where the largest population of neurons was born at E16 (Figures S4E and S4F). This is in accordance with the layer marker analysis and further supports the notion that the SBH is mainly formed by late-born neurons. Projection neurons of the cerebral cortex differ also in regard to their location within different cortical areas dedicated to distinct information processing tasks. Interestingly, the medial (low) to lateral (high) gradient in Cux1, Mdga1, and Rorβ expression, indicative of arealization in WT cerebral cortex, was detectable in the cKO NC (Figures 1J and 1L), and the SBH showed higher expression levels in the lateral and weaker at medial positions (Figures 1J and 1L; Figures S3M–S3P), suggesting some degree of arealization in both NC and HC. To test arealization at the functional level in the double cortex of cKO mice, we examined the primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortex by measuring immediate-early gene (IEG) expression triggered by light exposure for 1.5 hr under normal lighting conditions after 3 days of complete darkness. Immunostaining for the IEG products c-Fos and Egr-1 revealed a strong signal in visual cortex areas of WT animals, while expression of both genes was significantly lower in both the upper and lower cortex of cKO mice (Figures S5A and S5B). However, light-induced IEG expression was confined to visual cortical areas as no upregulation of c-Fos was detectable in the primary somatosensory (S1) cortex (Figure S5A). Thus, despite its severe disorganization, the cKO cortex still possesses functional arealization. Lastly, we examined the number of GABAergic neurons in the NC and HC, as their number is crucial for maturation of intracortical neural networks and plasticity (Gandhi et al., 2008Gandhi S.P.

However, GABAergic GAD67-positive neurons were present in normal numbers in the SBH (Figure S5D) and only slightly reduced in the NC of the cKO mice compared to controls (Figure S5D), suggesting that migration of GABAergic neurons is largely normal, but their number is not entirely sufficient to cover the increased size of the cKO cerebral cortex (1.32×, N = 4, p = 0.0001), intriguingly largely affecting the NC rather than the HC. Taken together, despite the profound alteration of a double cortex formation, neuronal subtype composition appears relatively normal. In order to understand when and how the prominent SBH is formed in the cKO mice, we first examined when RhoA protein disappears. While RhoA immunoreactivity was present throughout the WT cerebral cortex at embryonic day (E)12, it was largely absent in the cKO mice at this time (Figures 2A and 2B) but not yet at E11 (data not shown). As observed before (Cappello et al., 2006Cappello S. Attardo A. Wu X. Iwasato T. Itohara S. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Eilken H.M. Rieger M.A. Schroeder T.T.

Dorsal telencephalon-specific expression of Cre recombinase in PAC transgenic mice.Genesis. 2004; 38: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), Emx1::Cre-mediated recombination occurs specifically in the cerebral cortex, such that RhoA was still present in the neighboring plexus choroideus (Figure 2B, arrowhead) or the ganglionic eminence (GE, data not shown). Moreover, blood vessels depicted by arrows in Figure 2B also maintained RhoA, as Cre is not expressed in these cells. Already at E12, the first day of complete loss of RhoA protein in cKO mice, we noted a phenotype with mitotic cells stained for the phosphorylated form of histone 3 (Ph3) scattered in the cKO cerebral cortex in contrast to their alignment at the ventricular surface with few cells dividing at more basal positions in the cerebral cortex of control littermates (Figures 2C and 2D; see Experimental Procedures for terminology). Indeed, scattering of apical progenitors has also been observed when RhoA was deleted by other Cre lines in the midbrain or spinal cord (Herzog et al., 2011Herzog D. Loetscher P. van Hengel J. Knüsel S. Brakebusch C. Taylor V. Suter U. Relvas J.B. The small GTPase RhoA is required to maintain spinal cord neuroepithelium organization and the neural stem cell pool.J.

USA. 2011; 108: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Given the increased thickness of the adult mutant cerebral cortex of about 1.3-fold, compared to the control mentioned previously, and effects on proliferation upon RhoA deletion in the spinal cord and midbrain, we also analyzed the number of Ph3+ cells during development of the cerebral cortex. Notably, we observed a transient increase in the total number of Ph3-positive cells compared to WT littermates starting at occipital regions at E14 and later at E16 in rostral parts (Figures 2C and 2I), a pronounced difference to the profound reduction of proliferation after deletion of RhoA in the spinal cord. Thus, RhoA deletion affects proliferation in a region-specific manner within the cerebral cortex and differentially in distinct regions of the CNS (Herzog et al., 2011Herzog D. Loetscher P. van Hengel J. Knüsel S. Brakebusch C. Taylor V. Suter U. Relvas J.B.

USA. 2011; 108: 7607-7612Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In order to examine the etiology of the double cortex formation, we next examined progenitor and neuron localization at different time points. In accordance with the aberrant location of progenitor cells already at E12, some neurons labeled for βIII tubulin (Tuj1) were found in ectopic positions at the apical surface already at E12 (Figures 2J and 2K). Two days later, scattered progenitor cells had further spread covering the lower half of the cerebral cortex, and an increasing number of neurons were found mislocalized apically at the ventricular side (E14; Figures 2E, 2F, 2L, and 2M). Strikingly, by E16, mitotic cells had eventually assembled into a broad band located in the middle of the cerebral cortex between the pial and ventricular surfaces (Figures 2G and 2H). Interestingly, also the neurons had sorted out into two bands at this stage with an upper band corresponding to the cortical plate and a lower band of neurons located at the ventricular side below the progenitor zone (Figure 2N and 2O). The aberrant location of progenitors prompted the question of their identity and fate. Apical progenitors are RG expressing the transcription factor Pax6, while basally dividing cells express Tbr2 (Figure 3A ; Englund et al., 2005Englund C. Fink A. Lau C. Pham D. Daza R.A. Bulfone A. Kowalczyk T. Hevner R.F. Pax6, Tbr2, and Tbr1 are expressed sequentially by radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, and postmitotic neurons in developing neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Despite their mispositioning, many progenitors were Pax6 or Tbr2 immunoreactive in the cKO cerebral cortex, with very few double-positive cells, as is the case in the cerebral cortex of control mice (Figure 3B). Indeed, also at latter stages when progenitors arrange in a band within the cerebral cortex, separate populations maintain Pax6 or Tbr2-expression respectively (Figures 3C–3F) and are framed on both sides by Tbr1-immuno-positive neurons (Figures 3G and 3H). Thus, by E16, when most of the upper-layer neurons are generated, the later organization of the double cortex has emerged with a slightly thinner (compared to WT) cortical plate at the basal side, supposedly generating the NC, and an ectopic neuron band, supposedly generating the HC at the apical side. To determine to which extent the scattered Pax6+ cells maintain their RG identity and to examine their characteristic radial morphology, we next stained for nestin and RC2 to reveal the radial glial processes (Figures 3I, 3J, 3M, and 3N). This also revealed scattered cell somata and rather disorganized processes, which were no longer aligned and radially oriented in the cKO cerebral cortex (Figures 3N and 3N′) in contrast to controls (Figure 3M). The loss of apical anchoring of radial glial cells (see above as indicated by the scattered Pax6+ cells and below for F-actin analysis) further contributed to the disorganized arrangement of radial glia cell somata and processes. Indeed, many"

Here, we show that, unexpectedly, somatic ablation of Foxo1 in Neurog3(+) enteroendocrine progenitor cells gives rise to gut insulin-positive (Ins(+)) cells that express markers of mature β cells and secrete bioactive insulin as well as C-peptide in response to glucose and sulfonylureas. Lineage tracing experiments showed that gut Ins(+) cells arise cell autonomously from Foxo1-deficient cells. Inducible Foxo1 ablation in adult mice also resulted in the generation of gut Ins(+) cells. Following ablation by the β-cell toxin streptozotocin, gut Ins(+) cells regenerate and produce insulin, reversing hyperglycemia in mice. The data indicate that Neurog3(+) enteroendocrine progenitors require active Foxo1 to prevent differentiation into Ins(+) cells. Foxo1 ablation in gut epithelium may provide an approach to restore insulin production in type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2038005397,"Johannes Schödel and colleagues report the identification of a distant transcriptional enhancer of CCND1 at the recently identified renal cell carcinoma susceptibility locus at 11q13.3. The protective haplotype shows reduced binding of HIF-2α, reduced interaction with the transcriptional machinery and allelic imbalance in CCND1 expression. The study suggests that the hypoxia pathway is misregulated in renal cell carcinoma development. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified the existence of numerous population-based cancer susceptibility loci, mechanistic insights remain limited, particularly for intergenic polymorphisms. Here, we show that polymorphism at a remote intergenic region on chromosome 11q13.3, recently identified as a susceptibility locus for renal cell carcinoma1, modulates the binding and function of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) at a previously unrecognized transcriptional enhancer of CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1) that is specific for renal cancers characterized by inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL). The protective haplotype impairs binding of HIF-2, resulting in an allelic imbalance in cyclin D1 expression, thus affecting a link between hypoxia pathways and cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2085854746,"Synaptic vesicles in the brain harbor several soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins. With the exception of synaptobrevin2, or VAMP2 (syb2), which is directly involved in vesicle fusion, the role of these SNAREs in neurotransmission is unclear. Here we show that in mice syb2 drives rapid Ca(2+)-dependent synchronous neurotransmission, whereas the structurally homologous SNARE protein VAMP4 selectively maintains bulk Ca(2+)-dependent asynchronous release. At inhibitory nerve terminals, up- or downregulation of VAMP4 causes a correlated change in asynchronous release. Biochemically, VAMP4 forms a stable complex with SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 that does not interact with complexins or synaptotagmin-1, proteins essential for synchronous neurotransmission. Optical imaging of individual synapses indicates that trafficking of VAMP4 and syb2 show minimal overlap. Taken together, these findings suggest that VAMP4 and syb2 diverge functionally, traffic independently and support distinct forms of neurotransmission. These results provide molecular insight into how synapses diversify their release properties by taking advantage of distinct synaptic vesicle-associated SNAREs."
https://openalex.org/W2331195992,"Macrocycles are well represented in natural product structures but have been challenging to access for inclusion in synthetic libraries. A new method uses ring expansion to convert fused small rings into macrolactones and macrolactams that occupy natural product–like chemical space. Macrocycles are key structural elements in numerous bioactive small molecules and are attractive targets in the diversity-oriented synthesis of natural product–based libraries. However, efficient and systematic access to diverse collections of macrocycles has proven difficult using classical macrocyclization reactions. To address this problem, we have developed a concise, modular approach to the diversity-oriented synthesis of macrolactones and macrolactams involving oxidative cleavage of a bridging double bond in polycyclic enol ethers and enamines. These substrates are assembled in only four or five synthetic steps and undergo ring expansion to afford highly functionalized macrocycles bearing handles for further diversification. In contrast to macrocyclization reactions of corresponding seco acids, the ring expansion reactions are efficient and insensitive to ring size and stereochemistry, overcoming key limitations of conventional approaches to systematic macrocycle synthesis. Cheminformatic analysis indicates that these macrocycles access regions of chemical space that overlap with natural products, distinct from currently targeted synthetic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2044183928,"Kidney fibrosis is a common process that leads to the progression of various types of kidney disease. We used an integrated computational and experimental systems biology approach to identify protein kinases that regulate gene expression changes in the kidneys of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transgenic mice (Tg26 mice), which have both tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis. We identified homeo-domain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) as a key regulator of kidney fibrosis. HIPK2 was upregulated in the kidneys of Tg26 mice and in those of patients with various kidney diseases. HIV infection increased the protein concentrations of HIPK2 by promoting oxidative stress, which inhibited the seven in absentia homolog 1 (SIAH1)-mediated proteasomal degradation of HIPK2. HIPK2 induced apoptosis and the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers in kidney epithelial cells by activating the p53, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-SMAD family member 3 (Smad3) and Wnt-Notch pathways. Knockout of HIPK2 improved renal function and attenuated proteinuria and kidney fibrosis in Tg26 mice, as well as in other murine models of kidney fibrosis. We therefore conclude that HIPK2 is a potential target for anti-fibrosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2035816104,"A channel for the transport of hydrosulphide ions in Clostridium difficile is identified and shown to be polyspecific, being a member of the formate/nitrite transporter family. Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and the hydrosulphide ion (HS−) are metabolic products of anaerobic bacterial growth, and are thought to have had a crucial role in the emergence of life on Earth. At high concentrations, both are toxic to the cell, and therefore call for a release mechanism. For many years, such a channel has remained elusive, but now Bryan Czyzewski and Da-Neng Wang have used genetic, biochemical and structural approaches to identify and characterize a hydrosulphide ion channel in the pathogen Clostridium difficile. The channel is a member of the formate/nitrite transport family, and is polyspecific, facilitating the transport of HS−, formate and nitrite. Its low open probability is consistent with its physiological role in the cell. The hydrosulphide ion (HS−) and its undissociated form, hydrogen sulphide (H2S), which are believed to have been critical to the origin of life on Earth1, remain important in physiology and cellular signalling2. As a major metabolite in anaerobic bacterial growth, hydrogen sulphide is a product of both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulphate reduction2,3,4. These pathways can reduce various oxidized sulphur compounds including sulphate, sulphite and thiosulphate. The dissimilatory sulphate reduction pathway uses this molecule as the terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration, in which process it produces excess amounts of H2S (ref. 4). The reduction of sulphite is a key intermediate step in all sulphate reduction pathways. In Clostridium and Salmonella, an inducible sulphite reductase is directly linked to the regeneration of NAD+, which has been suggested to have a role in energy production and growth, as well as in the detoxification of sulphite3. Above a certain concentration threshold, both H2S and HS− inhibit cell growth by binding the metal centres of enzymes and cytochrome oxidase5, necessitating a release mechanism for the export of this toxic metabolite from the cell5,6,7,8,9. Here we report the identification of a hydrosulphide ion channel in the pathogen Clostridium difficile through a combination of genetic, biochemical and functional approaches. The HS− channel is a member of the formate/nitrite transport family, in which about 50 hydrosulphide ion channels form a third subfamily alongside those for formate10,11 (FocA) and for nitrite12 (NirC). The hydrosulphide ion channel is permeable to formate and nitrite as well as to HS− ions. Such polyspecificity can be explained by the conserved ion selectivity filter observed in the channel’s crystal structure. The channel has a low open probability and is tightly regulated, to avoid decoupling of the membrane proton gradient."

Consistent with this, mice lacking GIRK channels self-administer less cocaine (Morgan et al., 2003Morgan A.D. Carroll M.E. Loth A.K. Stoffel M. Wickman K.

Berton F. Sollini M. Blanchet C. Pravetoni M. Wickman K. Lüscher C. Absence and rescue of morphine withdrawal in GIRK/Kir3 knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4069-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Girk2 transcripts in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway are increased in some human cocaine addicts (Lehrmann et al., 2003Lehrmann E. Oyler J. Vawter M.P. Hyde T.M. Kolachana B.

Although GIRK channels are implicated in the response to addictive drugs, the cellular mechanisms underlying drug-evoked changes in GIRK signaling are not well understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that acquisition of addictive behaviors is learned and, similar to other learning and memory models, involves persistent changes in synaptic strength within the reward circuit and changes in DA neuron signaling (Koob and Volkow, 2010Koob G.F.

Early drug-evoked neuroadaptations are thought to occur within the VTA and are critical for remodeling the reward circuit and facilitating the development of addiction. Lesion of VTA DA neurons blocks drug-dependent addictive behaviors (Roberts and Koob, 1982Roberts D.C. Koob G.F.

Systemic injection of a psychostimulant strengthens excitatory synapses in the VTA (White et al., 1995White F.J. Hu X.T. Zhang X.F. Wolf M.E.

Neuro-adaptations in fast GABA transmission have also been reported; fast inhibitory currents mediated by GABAA receptors are impaired 24 hr after a single injection of morphine (Nugent et al., 2007Nugent F.S. Penick E.C. Kauer J.A. Opioids block long-term potentiation of inhibitory synapses.Nature. 2007; 446: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and the amplitudes of GABA-mediated synaptic currents are reduced in mice receiving several injections of cocaine (Liu et al., 2005Liu Q.S. Pu L. Poo M.M. Repeated cocaine exposure in vivo facilitates LTP induction in midbrain dopamine neurons.Nature. 2005; 437: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Chronic amphetamine enhances GABAB receptor transmission in the VTA during early withdrawal, but the cellular mechanism underlying this change is unknown (Giorgetti et al., 2002Giorgetti M. Hotsenpiller G. Froestl W. Wolf M.E. In vivo modulation of ventral tegmental area dopamine and glutamate efflux by local GABA(B) receptors is altered after repeated amphetamine treatment.Neuroscience. 2002; 109: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Following chronic cocaine or morphine treatment, D1R stimulation decreases GABAB-GIRK currents in DA neurons, but this occurs from a change in presynaptic GABA release (Bonci and Williams, 1996Bonci A. Williams J.T. A common mechanism mediates long-term changes in synaptic transmission after chronic cocaine and morphine.Neuron. 1996; 16: 631-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to characterize the early modulation of GABAB signaling by a single exposure to psychostimulants. We discovered that ∼24 hr following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of methamphetamine (METH) or cocaine, GABAB receptor signaling in VTA GABA neurons is strongly and persistently impaired. This drug-evoked depression of GABABR-GIRK signaling involves dephosphorylation of the GABAB receptor and changes in GABABR and GIRK channel trafficking. As a consequence, VTA GABA neuron firing is not affected by the GABABR agonist baclofen, suggesting GABAergic function may be augmented in the VTA with psychostimulants. A single injection of psychostimulants enhances glutamatergic synaptic efficacy in the VTA 24 hr later (Ungless et al., 2001Ungless M.A. Whistler J.L. Malenka R.C. Bonci A. Single cocaine exposure in vivo induces long-term potentiation in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2001; 411: 583-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, Borgland et al., 2004Borgland S.L.

We examined whether a single injection of psychostimulant also alters GABABR-GIRK signaling in the VTA. To test this, we injected C57BL/6 mice with methamphetamine (METH) at 2 mg/kg, a dose that elicits locomotor sensitization when administered repeatedly (Shimosato et al., 2001Shimosato K. Watanabe S.

We first investigated the synaptically activated GABABR-GIRKs, commonly referred to as the slow inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC), in acutely prepared VTA slices. High frequency (66 Hz) stimulation of GABA afferents induces a spillover of GABA that diffuses to perisynaptic GABAB receptors and elicits a slow outward K+ current (sIPSC; Figure 1). The GABAB receptor antagonist, CGP 54626 (2 μM), inhibited the evoked current, confirming the identity of the GABAB sIPSC (Figure 1), similar to previous studies (Johnson and North, 1992Johnson S.W. North R.A. Two types of neurone in the rat ventral tegmental area and their synaptic inputs.J. Physiol. 1992; 450: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar, Bonci and Williams, 1996Bonci A. Williams J.T. A common mechanism mediates long-term changes in synaptic transmission after chronic cocaine and morphine.Neuron. 1996; 16: 631-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In DA neurons, the GABAB sIPSC did not significantly change 24 hr following METH, compared to saline injection (Figures 1A and 1B). By contrast, the sIPSC was significantly smaller in GABA neurons (Figures 1D and 1E). Moreover, the sIPSC in GABA neurons remained depressed for at least 7 days (Figure 1E). Examination of the paired-pulse ratio for the fast GABAA-mediated IPSC revealed no difference in either DA or GABA neurons (Figures 1C and 1F), suggesting that the depression of the sIPSC in GABA neurons was not due to the inability of GABA terminals to release GABA. To investigate the effects of METH on synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAB receptors, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen was applied to the bath. As described previously (Labouèbe et al., 2007Labouèbe G. Lomazzi M. Cruz H.G. Creton C. Luján R. Li M. Yanagawa Y. Obata K. Watanabe M. Wickman K. et al.RGS2 modulates coupling between GABAB receptors and GIRK channels in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1559-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), saturating doses of baclofen (300 μM for DA and 100 μM for GABA) elicited large and desensitizing GABABR-activated GIRK currents in DA neurons and small nondesensitizing currents in GABA neurons (Figure 2). All baclofen-activated currents were inhibited with the inwardly rectifying K+ channel inhibitor Ba2+ or the GABAB receptor antagonist (CGP 54626, not shown). In contrast to the sIPSC recordings, there was an ∼40% decrease in the GABABR-GIRK currents of DA neurons 24 hr following a METH injection (Figures 2A and 2B). However, this decrease in current was not apparent at 7 days following METH injection (Figure 2B). By contrast, the baclofen-activated GIRK (IBaclofen) currents in GABA neurons were significantly depressed by ∼55% 24 hr following a single METH injection and the reduced IBaclofen persisted for 7 days (Figures 2C and 2D). We next examined whether METH altered GABABR-GIRK signaling in other brain regions. There was no significant change in the sIPSC or IBaclofen in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal or GABAergic neurons 24 hr following METH (Figure S1 available online). We also measured the sIPSC and IBaclofen in pyramidal and GABAergic neurons of the prelimbic cortex, a target region of VTA DA cells, and observed no significant changes in GABAB-GIRK currents in METH-injected mice (Figure S1). Thus, a single exposure to METH triggered a profound and long-lasting depression in both the sIPSC and IBaclofen in GABA neurons of the VTA. In addition to postsynaptic GABAB receptors, presynaptic GABAB receptors are also involved in reducing GABA release, typically through inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Padgett and Slesinger, 2010Padgett C.L. Slesinger P.A. GABAB receptor coupling to G-proteins and ion channels.Adv Pharmacol. 2010; 58: 123-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To investigate whether in vivo exposure to METH altered GABAB receptor-dependent presynaptic inhibition, we used an optogenetic strategy to selectively stimulate GABA neurons in the VTA and measure the effect of baclofen on a light-evoked fast inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) recorded in DA neurons (Figure 3). AAV virus expressing a double floxed-stopped channel rhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-eYFP was stereotaxically injected into the VTA of mice expressing Cre recombinase in GABA neurons (GAD65-Cre; Figure 3A; Figure S2). After 21 days, neurons expressing ChR2-eYFP were evident in horizontal slices of the VTA (Figure S2A). Prolonged blue light stimulation (400 ms) elicited tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive photocurrents in GABA neurons, whereas short light pulses (4 ms) evoked picrotoxin- and TTX-sensitive fast IPSCs in DA neurons (Figures S2B and 2SC; Figure 3B). Bath application of baclofen (1 μM) depressed the light-evoked IPSC by ∼50% in saline-injected mice. By contrast, baclofen (1 μM) decreased the light-evoked IPSC by only ∼20% in METH-injected mice (Figures 3B and 3C). Construction of dose-response curves revealed that GABAB receptor-dependent inhibition of presynaptic release was shifted significantly to higher agonist concentrations (Figure 3C), reflected by an increase in the IC50, which is the concentration of Baclofen needed to inhibit 50% of the light-induced current (Figure 3D). Similar to the change in postsynaptic GABABR-GIRK signaling, the reduced sensitivity of presynaptic GABABRs persisted for 7 days (Figures 3C and 3D). As a control, we examined GABABR-dependent presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release onto DA neurons by measuring the amplitude of electrically evoked AMPA EPSC, in the presence of increasing concentrations of baclofen (Figure S3). We found no significant change in the IC50 in METH-injected mice, compared to saline controls. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a single in vivo injection of METH triggers a depression in GABAB receptor signaling in VTA GABA neurons, both presynaptically (inhibition of GABA release) and postsynaptically (activation of GIRK channels). Cocaine is another psychostimulant that rapidly elevates DA levels within minutes after the injection. In contrast to METH, which is taken up by DA neurons and stimulates reverse transport of DA through the dopamine transporter (DAT), cocaine inhibits DAT from the extracellular side (Sulzer, 2011Sulzer D. How addictive drugs disrupt presynaptic dopamine neurotransmission.Neuron. 2011; 69: 628-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We examined whether a single injection of cocaine would evoke a change in GABABR-GIRK signaling. Like METH, cocaine (15 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease in the sIPSC in GABA neurons but not in DA neurons 24 hr later (Figures 4A –4D). Similarly, IBaclofen was depressed in GABA neurons but not in DA neurons (Figures 4E–4H). Thus, both cocaine and METH trigger a similar neuroadaptation in GABABR-GIRK signaling in GABA neurons of the VTA, suggesting that elevated DA may be an important step in inducing the GABABR-GIRK plasticity. Dopamine stimulates two classes of DA receptors, D1- and D2-like receptors, in the brain (White, 1996White F.J. Synaptic regulation of mesocorticolimbic dopamine neurons.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 405-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). D1-like receptor antagonists block sensitization to psychostimulants (Kalivas and Stewart, 1991Kalivas P.W. Stewart J.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13140-13150Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and prevent psychostimulant-induced changes in glutamatergic signaling in the VTA (Argilli et al., 2008Argilli E. Sibley D.R. Malenka R.C. England P.M. Bonci A. Mechanism and time course of cocaine-induced long-term potentiation in the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9092-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Brown et al., 2010Brown M.T. Bellone C. Mameli M. Labouèbe G. Bocklisch C. Balland B. Dahan L. Luján R. Deisseroth K. Lüscher C. Drug-driven AMPA receptor redistribution mimicked by selective dopamine neuron stimulation.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e15870Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To test the requirement for DA receptors, we injected an antagonist for D1-like (SCH39166) or D2-like (Eticlopride) receptors with METH (Figure 5). In contrast to injection of METH alone, the sIPSC recorded from mice injected with METH and SCH39166 (0.3 mg/kg) was not significantly different from saline (Figures 5A and 5B). By contrast, co-injection of Eticlopride (0.1 mg/kg) with METH did not attenuate the METH-dependent decrease in sIPSC. For macroscopic GABABR-GIRK currents, co-injection of METH and SCH39166 also partially blocked the METH-dependent decrease in IBaclofen (Figures 5C and 5D). Interestingly, co-injection of Eticlopride with METH attenuated the METH-dependent decrease in IBaclofen (Figures 5C and 5D), in contrast to the effect of Eticlopride on the sIPSC. This could reflect a difference in synaptically and extrasynaptically activated GABAB receptors. For cocaine, co-injection of METH or cocaine with both SCH39166 and Eticlopride partially recovered the sIPSC, compared to saline-injected controls (Figures 5B and 5D). Together, these pharmacological experiments clearly implicate DA and the D1-like receptor in mediating psychostimulant-dependent depression in GABABR-GIRK signaling in VTA GABA neurons, similar to the plasticity changes in excitatory synapses in VTA DA neurons following cocaine (Argilli et al., 2008Argilli E. Sibley D.R. Malenka R.C. England P.M. Bonci A. Mechanism and time course of cocaine-induced long-term potentiation in the ventral tegmental area.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9092-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A reduction in the amplitude of GABAB-GIRK currents could involve a change in G protein coupling (Nestler et al., 1990Nestler E.J. Terwilliger R.Z. Walker J.R. Sevarino K.A. Duman R.S.

To investigate the latter possibility, we used quantitative immuno-electron microscopy to study the subcellular distribution of GABAB receptors and GIRK channels in saline- and METH-injected mice. In serial ultrathin sections through the VTA, GABA neurons were identified using antibodies against GAD65/67 and secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), generating a dark reaction product in GABA neurons (Figures 6A and 6B). VTA sections were also labeled with immunogold particles using specific antibodies for GABAB1 or GIRK2 (Kulik et al., 2003Kulik A. Vida I. Luján R. Haas C.A. López-Bendito G. Shigemoto R. Frotscher M. Subcellular localization of metabotropic GABA(B) receptor subunits GABA(B1a/b) and GABA(B2) in the rat hippocampus.J.

In single ultrathin sections (Figures 6A and 6B), both GABAB1 and GIRK2 were expressed predominantly at the plasma membrane of GABA neuron dendrites (Den; arrows) following saline injection. By contrast, 24 hr following a METH injection, there was a reduction in plasma membrane associated GABAB1 and an increase at intracellular sites (Figure 6A, crossed arrows). Similarly, there was a reduction in GIRK2 protein on the plasma membrane and an increase in intracellular compartments in GABA neurons following METH treatment (Figure 6B). To quantify these changes, we generated a three-dimensional reconstruction of the dendrite using the serial ultrathin sections (Figures 6C and 6D) and then counted gold particles on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Calculating the surface and intracellular densities (Figures 6E and 6F) revealed that 24 hr following METH injection there was a significant reduction (∼60%–70%) in plasma membrane-associated GABAB1 and GIRK2, with a concomitant increase in the intracellular-associated GABAB1 and GIRK2 (∼50%–65%).

https://openalex.org/W1990613087,"The X-ray crystal structure of a bacterial concentrative nucleoside transporter reveals the overall architecture of this class of transporter and provides a framework for understanding how nucleosides and nucleoside-derived drugs traverse cell membranes. Concentrative nucleoside transporters are integral membrane proteins that are responsible for the selective uptake of nucleosides and nucleoside-derived anticancer and antiviral drugs into cells. This paper presents the first X-ray crystal structure of a member of a concentrative nucleoside transporter family, from the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae, in complex with uridine. The structure reveals the overall architecture of this class of transporter and the molecular determinants for nucleoside- and sodium-binding. Nucleosides are required for DNA and RNA synthesis, and the nucleoside adenosine has a function in a variety of signalling processes1,2. Transport of nucleosides across cell membranes provides the major source of nucleosides in many cell types and is also responsible for the termination of adenosine signalling. As a result of their hydrophilic nature, nucleosides require a specialized class of integral membrane proteins, known as nucleoside transporters (NTs), for specific transport across cell membranes. In addition to nucleosides, NTs are important determinants for the transport of nucleoside-derived drugs across cell membranes3,4,5. A wide range of nucleoside-derived drugs, including anticancer drugs (such as Ara-C and gemcitabine) and antiviral drugs (such as zidovudine and ribavirin), have been shown to depend, at least in part, on NTs for transport across cell membranes4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Concentrative nucleoside transporters, members of the solute carrier transporter superfamily SLC28, use an ion gradient in the active transport of both nucleosides and nucleoside-derived drugs against their chemical gradients. The structural basis for selective ion-coupled nucleoside transport by concentrative nucleoside transporters is unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of a concentrative nucleoside transporter from Vibrio cholerae in complex with uridine at 2.4 Å. Our functional data show that, like its human orthologues, the transporter uses a sodium-ion gradient for nucleoside transport. The structure reveals the overall architecture of this class of transporter, unravels the molecular determinants for nucleoside and sodium binding, and provides a framework for understanding the mechanism of nucleoside and nucleoside drug transport across cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2076225732,"In multiple sensory systems, adaptation to the variance of a sensory input changes the sensitivity, kinetics, and average response over timescales ranging from < 100 ms to tens of seconds. Here, we present a simple, biophysically relevant model of retinal contrast adaptation that accurately captures both the membrane potential response and all adaptive properties. The adaptive component of this model is a first-order kinetic process of the type used to describe ion channel gating and synaptic transmission. From the model, we conclude that all adaptive dynamics can be accounted for by depletion of a signaling mechanism, and that variance adaptation can be explained as adaptation to the mean of a rectified signal. The model parameters show strong similarity to known properties of bipolar cell synaptic vesicle pools. Diverse types of adaptive properties that implement theoretical principles of efficient coding can be generated by a single type of molecule or synapse with just a few microscopic states."

H(2)S accumulates during hypoxia and promotes HIF-1 activity, but how H(2)S signals are perceived and transmitted to modulate HIF-1 and animal behavior is unknown. We report that the experience of hypoxia modifies a C. elegans locomotive behavioral response to O(2) through the EGL-9 pathway. From genetic screens to identify novel regulators of EGL-9-mediated behavioral plasticity, we isolated mutations of the gene cysl-1, which encodes a C. elegans homolog of sulfhydrylases/cysteine synthases. Hypoxia-dependent behavioral modulation and H(2)S-induced HIF-1 activation require the direct physical interaction of CYSL-1 with the EGL-9 C terminus. Sequestration of EGL-9 by CYSL-1 and inhibition of EGL-9-mediated hydroxylation by hypoxia together promote neuronal HIF-1 activation to modulate behavior. These findings demonstrate that CYSL-1 acts to transduce signals from H(2)S to EGL-9 to regulate O(2)-dependent behavioral plasticity in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1965872874,"We have analyzed the molecular mechanisms of photoinduced cell death using porphyrins with similar structure differing only in the position of the ethylene glycol (EG) chain on the phenyl ring. Meta- and para-positioned EG chains targeted porphyrins to different subcellular compartments. After photoactivation, both types of derivatives induced death of tumor cells via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Para derivatives pTPP(EG)4 and pTPPF(EG)4 primarily accumulated in lysosomes activated the p38 MAP kinase cascade, which in turn induced the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In contrast, meta porphyrin derivative mTPP(EG)4 localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induced dramatic changes in Ca2+ homeostasis manifested by Ca2+ rise in the cytoplasm, activation of calpains and stress caspase-12 or caspase-4. ER stress developed into unfolded protein response. Immediately after irradiation the PERK pathway was activated through phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2α and induction of transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP, which regulate stress response genes. PERK knockdown and PERK deficiency protected cells against mTPP(EG)4-mediated apoptosis, confirming the causative role of the PERK pathway."

Synthetic tool compounds and hybrid constructs now provide insights into the specificity of the ketoreductase in dehydrozearalenol biosynthesis. Iterative highly reducing polyketide synthases from filamentous fungi are the most complex and enigmatic type of polyketide synthase discovered to date. Here we uncover an unusual degree of programming by the hypothemycin highly reducing polyketide synthase, in which a single ketoreductase domain shows stereospecificity that is controlled by substrate length. Mapping of the structural domains responsible for this feature allowed for the biosynthesis of an unnatural diastereomer of the natural product dehydrozearalenol."
https://openalex.org/W1964703103,"One mechanism proposed for reducing the risk of calcium renal stones is activation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) on the apical membranes of collecting duct principal cells by high luminal calcium. This would reduce the abundance of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and in turn the rate of water reabsorption. While evidence in cells and in hypercalciuric animal models supports this hypothesis, the relevance of the interplay between the CaR and AQP2 in humans is not clear. This paper reports for the first time a detailed correlation between urinary AQP2 excretion under acute vasopressin action (DDAVP treatment) in hypercalciuric subjects and in parallel analyzes AQP2-CaR crosstalk in a mouse collecting duct cell line (MCD4) expressing endogenous and functional CaR. In normocalciurics, DDAVP administration resulted in a significant increase in AQP2 excretion paralleled by an increase in urinary osmolality indicating a physiological response to DDAVP. In contrast, in hypercalciurics, baseline AQP2 excretion was high and did not significantly increase after DDAVP. Moreover DDAVP treatment was accompanied by a less pronounced increase in urinary osmolality. These data indicate reduced urinary concentrating ability in response to vasopressin in hypercalciurics. Consistent with these results, biotinylation experiments in MCD4 cells revealed that membrane AQP2 expression in unstimulated cells exposed to CaR agonists was higher than in control cells and did not increase significantly in response to short term exposure to forskolin (FK). Interestingly, we found that CaR activation by specific agonists reduced the increase in cAMP and prevented any reduction in Rho activity in response to FK, two crucial pathways for AQP2 translocation. These data support the hypothesis that CaR-AQP2 interplay represents an internal renal defense to mitigate the effects of hypercalciuria on the risk of calcium precipitation during antidiuresis. This mechanism and possibly reduced medulla tonicity may explain the lower concentrating ability observed in hypercalciuric patients."
https://openalex.org/W1998013319,"Both human speech and animal vocal signals contain frequency-modulated (FM) sounds. Although central auditory neurons that selectively respond to the direction of frequency modulation are known, the synaptic mechanisms underlying the generation of direction selectivity (DS) remain elusive. Here we show the emergence of DS neurons in the inferior colliculus by mapping the three major subcortical auditory nuclei. Cell-attached recordings reveal a highly reliable and precise firing of DS neurons to FM sweeps in a preferred direction. By using in vivo whole-cell current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings, we found that the synaptic inputs to DS neurons are not direction selective, but temporally reversed excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are evoked in response to opposing directions of FM sweeps. The construction of such temporal asymmetry, resulting DS, and its topography can be attributed to the spectral disparity of the excitatory and the inhibitory synaptic tonal receptive fields."
https://openalex.org/W2054451538,"This research aims to foster discourse about the extent to which gender is important to consider within the context of participatory approaches for biological conservation. Our objectives are to: (1) gender-disaggregate data about stakeholders' risk perceptions associated with human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in a participatory conservation context, and (2) highlight insights from characterizing gendered similarities and differences in the way people think about HWC-related risks. Two communal conservancies in Caprivi, Namibia served as case study sites. We analyzed data from focus groups (n = 2) to create gendered concept maps about risks to wildlife and livelihoods and any associations of those risks with HWC, and semi-structured interviews (n = 76; men = 38, women = 38) to measure explicit risk attitudes associated with HWC. Concept maps indicated some divergent perceptions in how groups characterized risks to wildlife and livelihoods; however, not only were identified risks to wildlife (e.g., pollution, hunting) dissimilar in some instances, descriptions of risks varied as well. Study groups reported similar risk perceptions associated with HWC with the exception of worry associated with HWC effects on local livelihoods. Gendered differences in risk perceptions may signal different priorities or incentives to participate in efforts to resolve HWC-related risks. Thus, although shared goals and interests may seem to be an obvious reason for cooperative wildlife management, it is not always obvious that management goals are shared. Opportunity exists to move beyond thinking about gender as an explanatory variable for understanding how different groups think about participating in conservation activities."
https://openalex.org/W2007042376,"Hearing loss prevents vocal learning and causes learned vocalizations to deteriorate, but how vocalization-related auditory feedback acts on neural circuits that control vocalization remains poorly understood. We deafened adult zebra finches, which rely on auditory feedback to maintain their learned songs, to test the hypothesis that deafening modifies synapses on neurons in a sensorimotor nucleus important to song production. Longitudinal in vivo imaging revealed that deafening selectively decreased the size and stability of dendritic spines on neurons that provide input to a striatothalamic pathway important to audition-dependent vocal plasticity, and changes in spine size preceded and predicted subsequent vocal degradation. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings from these neurons showed that structural changes were accompanied by functional weakening of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, increased intrinsic excitability, and changes in spontaneous action potential output. These findings shed light on where and how auditory feedback acts within sensorimotor circuits to shape learned vocalizations.

Deafening shrinks dendritic spines in a sensorimotor nucleus for learned birdsong Spines shrink only on neurons innervating a pathway necessary for song plasticity Decreases in spine size precede and predict deafening-induced changes to song Deafening weakens synapses on these HVC neurons, which could affect singing Auditory feedback is critical for learning and maintaining complex motor skills ranging from musical performance to speech. For example, hearing loss prevents speech learning in children and degrades speech in adults (Petitto, 1993Petitto L.A. On the ontogenetic requirements for early language acquisition.in: de Boysson-Bardies B. de Schonen S. Jusczyk P. MacNeilage P. Morton J.

Despite the central role of auditory feedback in these vocal processes, where and how auditory feedback acts on neural circuits for vocal learning and maintenance remain poorly understood. Birdsong provides a highly tractable system for understanding the neural mechanisms by which auditory feedback affects vocalization. Juvenile songbirds use auditory feedback to learn their songs (Konishi, 1965Konishi M. The role of auditory feedback in the control of vocalization in the white-crowned sparrow.Z.

Auditory feedback is necessary for the maintenance of stereotyped song in adult zebra finches.Behav. Neural Biol. 1992; 57: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Indeed, deafening adult zebra finches, which sing highly stereotyped songs, causes the spectral and temporal features of their songs to degrade over days to weeks (Horita et al., 2008; Lombardino and Nottebohm, 2000Lombardino A.J. Nottebohm F. Age at deafening affects the stability of learned song in adult male zebra finches.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5054-5064PubMed Google Scholar, Nordeen and Nordeen, 1992Nordeen K.W. Nordeen E.J. Auditory feedback is necessary for the maintenance of stereotyped song in adult zebra finches.Behav. Neural Biol. 1992; 57: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, the stereotypy of adult song enables precise quantification of the vocal effects of deafening, and the delayed effects of deafening on adult song allow for resulting neural changes to be temporally correlated with either initial removal of feedback or later changes to the vocal pattern. Songbirds are also advantageous for studying how feedback affects vocalization because the neural circuits for singing (i.e., the song system) are well described. Although feedback must act on the song system to affect vocalization, the sites of this sensorimotor interaction remain unclear. One potential site of interaction is the song system nucleus HVC, which is necessary for singing (Nottebohm et al., 1976Nottebohm F. Stokes T.M. Leonard C.M. Central control of song in the canary, Serinus canarius.J. Comp. Neurol. 1976; 165: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), contains neurons that exhibit precisely time-locked activity when the bird is producing or passively listening to song (Fujimoto et al., 2011Fujimoto H.

Moreover, HVC includes two projection neuron (PN) types, one (HVCRA) that innervates the song premotor nucleus RA, and another (HVCX) that provides auditory and song motor-related input to the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a striatothalamic circuit necessary for audition-dependent vocal plasticity in adult zebra finches (Andalman and Fee, 2009Andalman A.S.

These features advance HVC PNs, and particularly HVCX neurons, as sites where feedback-related information could access circuitry important for song learning and maintenance. Despite the attractiveness of this idea, disrupting feedback with singing-triggered noise, which can drive song degradation over hours or days, fails to alter the singing-related activity of HVCX neurons, at least over tens of minutes (Kozhevnikov and Fee, 2007Kozhevnikov A.A.

Peters S. Nowicki S. Mooney R. Precise auditory-vocal mirroring in neurons for learned vocal communication.Nature. 2008; 451: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Interestingly, feedback perturbation in zebra finches immediately alters the singing-related activity of neurons that supply direct or indirect auditory input to HVC (Keller and Hahnloser, 2009Keller G.B.

Manipulation of a central auditory representation shapes learned vocal output.Neuron. 2010; 65: 122-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and, in Bengalese finches, can acutely suppress the singing-related activity of putative HVC interneurons (Sakata and Brainard, 2008Sakata J.T. Brainard M.S. Online contributions of auditory feedback to neural activity in avian song control circuitry.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 11378-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), some of which may provide inhibitory input to HVCX neurons (Mooney and Prather, 2005Mooney R. Prather J.F. The HVC microcircuit: the synaptic basis for interactions between song motor and vocal plasticity pathways.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1952-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These different findings could be reconciled by a model in which HVCX neurons accumulate feedback information slowly (hours to days) and where feedback-driven changes in these cells first appear as a subtle modification of synaptic input, rather than changes in action potential output. Testing this model requires a way of longitudinally monitoring synapses on identified neurons before and after manipulation of auditory feedback changes song output, a goal currently impractical to achieve using electrophysiological methods. In vivo, multiphoton imaging of fluorescently labeled neurons can resolve individual dendritic spines, which are postsynaptic components of excitatory synapses in the vertebrate brain (De Robertis and Bennett, 1955De Robertis E.D.P. Bennett H.S. Some features of the submicroscopic morphology of synapses in frog and earthworm.J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Palay, 1956Palay S.L. Synapses in the central nervous system.J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1956; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and this method has been used in a variety of longitudinal studies to measure experience-dependent changes to synapses (for reviews, see Alvarez and Sabatini, 2007Alvarez V.A. Sabatini B.L. Anatomical and physiological plasticity of dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, and Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009Holtmaat A. Svoboda K. Experience-dependent structural synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Recently, this method has also been used to show that auditory experience of a vocal model stabilizes and enlarges HVC dendritic spines in juvenile songbirds over a period of days (Roberts et al., 2010Roberts T.F. Tschida K.A. Klein M.E. Mooney R. Rapid spine stabilization and synaptic enhancement at the onset of behavioural learning.Nature. 2010; 463: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), advancing it as a suitable method for detecting relatively slow feedback-related changes to synapses in the HVC of adult songbirds. Here, we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging of dendritic spines in deafened adult zebra finches to test the idea that synapses on HVC PNs are sensitive to changes in auditory feedback. To label and identify HVC projection neurons for in vivo imaging, a GFP-lentivirus was injected into HVC, and differently colored retrograde tracers were injected into the two downstream targets of HVC, the striatal region Area X and the song premotor nucleus RA, in young adult male zebra finches (Figure 1A and see Figure S1A available online; 80 to 150 days posthatch (dph), mean age was 97 ± 5 days, all reported errors are SEM unless otherwise noted). Birds were maintained on a reverse day-night cycle and imaging sessions were conducted during the birds' subjective nighttimes, to minimize interference with singing behavior (2 sessions per night separated by a 2 hr interval). Images were obtained through a cranial window and collection of imaging data was restricted to neurons with dendritic spines, because both populations of HVC PNs are spinous (Mooney, 2000Mooney R. Different subthreshold mechanisms underlie song selectivity in identified HVc neurons of the zebra finch.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5420-5436PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were identified as either HVCX or HVCRA cells by the presence of blue or red retrograde label or, in the absence of retrograde label, by the measurement of soma size, which differed significantly for the two PN types (Figures 1A and S1B). After collecting 1–2 nights of baseline imaging data, birds were deafened by bilateral removal of the cochleae, and data collection was continued as long as possible (13 birds were imaged for an average of 7.2 ± 4.1 nights postdeafening). An initial assessment was made of the effects of deafening on the size of spines in HVC PNs, because changes in spine size often correlate with functional changes in synaptic strength (Kopec et al., 2006Kopec C.D.

Poo M.M. Shrinkage of dendritic spines associated with long-term depression of hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 2004; 44: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Size measurements were made from spines that were maintained across two nights of imaging (over a 24 hr interval), and a size index was calculated for each measured spine (time 24 size/time 0 size), with values greater than 1 indicating an increase in size and values less than 1 indicating a decrease in size. Prior to deafening, spines in HVCX neurons tended to increase slightly in size, while spines in HVCRA neurons tended not to change in size over 24 hr (size index = 1.07 ± 0.03 for HVCX neurons: 106 spines, 10 cells, 9 birds; size index = 1.00 ± 0.02 for HVCRA neurons: 94 spines, 9 cells, 8 birds; p = 0.05 for difference between cell types, Mann-Whitney U test). Interestingly, comparing spine size measurements made in a subset of these cells during the first 24 hr time window to those obtained in the last 24 hr time window following deafening (7-8 nights postdeafening on average) revealed that spine size index decreased significantly following deafening in HVCX but not HVCRA neurons (example images in Figure 1B; group data in Figure 1C; HVCX: average of 10.8 ± 0.3 spines scored per cell in each 24 hr comparison, total of 152 spines from 7 cells in 6 birds, p = 0.03, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test; HVCRA: average of 11.3 ± 0.4 spines scored per cell in each 24 hr comparison, total of 146 spines from 8 cells in 6 birds, p = 0.67). Thus, deafening causes a cell-type-specific decrease in the size of spines of HVCX neurons. Establishing when these structural changes occur relative to deafening-induced song degradation depends on detecting initially subtle vocal changes following deafening. To this end, we analyzed two spectral features, Wiener entropy and entropy variance (EV), of each syllable in a bird's song over time (see Experimental Procedures). These parameters respectively measure the uniformity of a sound's power spectrum and intrasyllabic transitions from tonal to broadband sounds (Tchernichovski et al., 2000Tchernichovski O. Nottebohm F. Ho C.E. Pesaran B. Mitra P.P. A procedure for an automated measurement of song similarity.Anim. Behav. 2000; 59: 1167-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and were chosen because they remain stable in hearing adults (Figure S2A), change in predictable directions following deafening (Figure S2B), and were found to be the earliest spectral features that changed following deafening (data not shown). This analysis detected subtle but significant effects of deafening on syllable spectral features in nearly all birds (18/19) within the first 4 days that they sang following deafening, with ∼50% (10/19) of birds showing significant degradation over the first day of singing after deafening (Figures 2A and 2C). Notably, the changes we detected occur days to weeks earlier than those reported in previous studies (Brainard and Doupe, 2000Brainard M.S. Doupe A.J. Interruption of a basal ganglia-forebrain circuit prevents plasticity of learned vocalizations.Nature. 2000; 404: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, Horita et al., 2008Horita H.

Auditory feedback is necessary for the maintenance of stereotyped song in adult zebra finches.Behav. Neural Biol. 1992; 57: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this analysis method is extremely sensitive to early deafening-induced song changes. The number of days to onset of this subtle degradation was not predicted by the age of the bird (Figure 2C), although older birds sang a larger number of motifs before their songs degraded (Figure 2D; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Finally, the effects of deafening on syllable sequencing occurred later than spectral changes in all birds (data not shown; see Experimental Procedures), indicating that measurement of spectral features serves as the most reliable early marker of deafening-induced song degradation. The onset of song degradation estimated in this manner was used to temporally align in vivo imaging data collected from different birds. To facilitate comparison between HVCX and HVCRA neurons and take into account different predeafening values of spine size index, each cell's last predeafening size index value was used to normalize its subsequent size index values (Figure S3A, left and middle panels), and these normalized values were pooled separately for the two cell types (Figures 3A and S3A, right panel). Interestingly, these pooled comparisons revealed that spine size index of HVCX neurons decreased prior to the onset of song degradation, whereas spine size index of HVCRA neurons did not change before or after songs began to degrade (Figure 3A; HVCX: average of 11.2 ± 0.4 spines scored per 24 hr comparison, total of 495 spines from 7 neurons in 6 birds; HVCRA: average of 11.0 ± 0.3 spines scored per 24 hr comparison, total of 428 spines from 8 neurons in 6 birds, time > 0 is postdegradation). Although we also attempted to assess whether changes in HVCX neuron spine size occurred prior to the onset of song degradation on a bird-by-bird basis, size index data from individual neurons were noisy (Figure S3A), and decreases in size index were rarely significantly different from baseline for individual cells. In summary, deafening causes a cell-type-specific decrease in the size of spines in HVCX neurons that on average precedes the onset of song degradation. The finding that deafening-induced decreases in HVCX neuron spine size precede the onset of song degradation raises the possibility that spine size changes are predictive of subsequent changes in vocal behavior. To test this idea, we calculated the correlation between postdeafening HVCX spine size index measurements and the amount of song degradation that occurred on the following day of singing (“day +1,” measured as % change from baseline entropy or EV of the first syllable to degrade). This comparison revealed a significant positive correlation, indicating that larger decreases in spine size index preceded more severe song degradation (Figure 4A ; R = 0.57, p < 0.001, linear regression). In contrast, no significant correlations were observed between spine size index and behavior when similar comparisons were made to song behavior recorded on the day preceding the 24 hr size index measurement (day −1), the intervening day between the two nights of imaging (day 0), or greater than day +1 (Figure 4B). These findings support the idea that decreases in HVCX neuron spine size index predict subsequent behavioral change with an ∼12 hr time lag, rather than accompanying or following vocal changes. Various control measurements ensured that decreases in HVCX neuron spine size index were unrelated to imaging methodology. First, decreases in HVCX spine size index were not due to effects of longitudinal imaging, because HVCX spine size index never underwent a significant decrease in longitudinally imaged, age-matched hearing birds (Figure 3B; control HVCX: average of 9.5 ± 0.3 spines scored per 24 hr comparison, total of 95 spines from 4 cells in 4 birds; control HVCRA: average of 9.6 ± 0.5 spines scored per 24 hr comparison, total of 77 spines from 3 cells in 3 birds). Second, decreases in HVCX size index were unrelated to variable sampling of dendritic branches over time (Figure S3B), ruling out the possibility that the spatial variability in spine sampling could account for decreases in HVCX neuron spine size index. Finally, spine size decreased in slightly more than half of the individual spines (20/35) that were tracked for multiple nights following deafening (average of 6.6 ± 0.5 nights), indicating that decreases in size index were also unrelated to variable sampling of individual dendritic spines (Figure S3C). Interestingly, the change in size for individual spines was negatively and significantly correlated with their initial, predeafening size, suggesting that deafening preferentially weakens stronger excitatory synapses (Figure S3C; R = −0.44, p < 0.01, linear regression). A similar relationship was not observed for individual spines tracked from longitudinally imaged HVCX neurons in hearing birds (i.e., a smaller proportion of tracked spines decreased in size, and there was no relationship between initial spine size and subsequent change in size, R = −0.06, p = 0.81, data not shown). These various measurements are consistent with the idea that deafening selectively weakens synapses on HVC neurons that innervate a striatothalamic circuit necessary for audition-dependent vocal plasticity. Because spine stability is a structural correlate of synaptic strength (De Roo et al., 2008De Roo M. Klauser P. Muller D.

Tschida K.A. Klein M.E. Mooney R. Rapid spine stabilization and synaptic enhancement at the onset of behavioural learning.Nature. 2010; 463: 948-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), we also examined whether deafening destabilizes spines in HVC. Stable spines were defined as those that were maintained over a 2 hr interval (within night, see Experimental Procedures). Spine stability was relatively high in both cell types prior to deafening (HVCX: 92.0% ± 1.6% spines stable over 2 hr, average of 56 ± 6 spines scored per 2 hr comparison, total of 731 spines from 13 cells in 8 birds; HVCRA: 93.9% ± 1.0% spines stable over 2 hr, average of 79 ± 13 spines scored per 2 hr comparison, total of 789 spines from 10 cells in 7 birds; p = 0.33 for difference between PN types, Mann-Whitney U test). However, tracking spine stability before and after deafening revealed that spine stability decreased in HVCX but not HVCRA neurons (Figures 5A and 5B ; HVCX: average of 55 ± 6 spines scored per 2 hr comparison, total of 3,562 spines from 14 cells in 9 birds; HVCRA: average of 63 ± 6 spines scored per 2 hr comparison, total of 3,217 spines from 12 cells in 8 birds). This destabilization reflected increases in spine gain and loss (Figure 5C; both measures tended to increase, albeit nonsignificantly), consistent with our observation that deafening did not affect spine density in HVCX neurons (data not shown). In contrast to the more rapid effects of deafening on spine size, however, deafening destabilized spines only after the onset of song degradation (Figure 5B). Decreases in spine stability were not attributable to effects of longitudinal imaging, because HVCX neurons from longitudinally imaged, age-matched hearing birds never underwent a significant decrease in spine stability (Figure 5D; control HVCX: average of 74 ± 13 spines scored per cell in each 2 hr comparison, total of 1,964 spines from 6 cells in 4 birds; control HVCRA: average of 51 ± 7 spines scored per cell in each 2 hr comparison, total of 1,168 spines from 7 cells in 4 birds). Further, although there was a slight negative relationship between the variability of dendritic sampling and levels of spine stability (i.e., postdeafening measurements including dendritic segments that were not scored on the predeafening, baseline night tended to have lower stability values), subsequent resampling of the data to include only postdeafening measurements in which >50% of the dendritic segments sampled were the same as those sampled in the baseline measurement did not support the idea that variability in spatial sampling accounts for decreased spine stability in HVCX neurons (Figures S4A and S4B). Thus, deafening decreases HVCX spine size and stability, which are two structural correlates of synaptic weakening (Nägerl et al., 2004Nägerl U.V. Eberhorn N. Cambridge S.B. Bonhoeffer T.

https://openalex.org/W2045080833,"Denervation-induced changes in excitatory synaptic strength were studied following entorhinal deafferentation of hippocampal granule cells in mature (≥3 weeks old) mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal slice cultures. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase in excitatory synaptic strength in response to denervation during the first week after denervation. By the end of the second week synaptic strength had returned to baseline. Because these adaptations occurred in response to the loss of excitatory afferents, they appeared to be in line with a homeostatic adjustment of excitatory synaptic strength. To test whether denervation-induced changes in synaptic strength exploit similar mechanisms as homeostatic synaptic scaling following pharmacological activity blockade, we treated denervated cultures at 2 days post lesion for 2 days with tetrodotoxin. In these cultures, the effects of denervation and activity blockade were not additive, suggesting that similar mechanisms are involved. Finally, we investigated whether entorhinal denervation, which removes afferents from the distal dendrites of granule cells while leaving the associational afferents to the proximal dendrites of granule cells intact, results in a global or a local up-scaling of granule cell synapses. By using computational modeling and local electrical stimulations in Strontium (Sr2+)-containing bath solution, we found evidence for a lamina-specific increase in excitatory synaptic strength in the denervated outer molecular layer at 3–4 days post lesion. Taken together, our data show that entorhinal denervation results in homeostatic functional changes of excitatory postsynapses of denervated dentate granule cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2135828846,"Wnt7a is known to be a tumor suppressor that is lost in NSCLC, but no mechanism of loss has been established. Methylation of promoter regions has been established as a common mechanism of loss of tumor suppressor expression in NSCLC. We previously demonstrated that loss of Wnt7a in non-transformed lung epithelial cell lines led to increased cell growth, altered 3-D culture growth, and increased migration. The Wnt7a promoter has a higher percentage of methylation in NSCLC tumor tissue compared to matched normal lung tissue and methylation of the promoter region leads to decreased activity. We treated H157 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and detected loss of Wnt7a promoter methylation, increased Wnt7a expression, and increased activity of the Wnt7a lung signaling pathway. When DNMT1 expression was knocked down by shRNA, expression of Wnt7a increased and methylation decreased. Together these data suggest that in NSCLC, Wnt7a is lost by methylation in a subset of tumors and that this methylation is maintained by DNMT1. Restoration of Wnt7a expression through demethylation could be an important therapeutic approach in the treatment of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2040404585,"Disruption of ephrin B1 in collagen I producing cells in mice results in severe skull defects and reduced bone formation. Because ephrin B1 is also expressed during osteoclast differentiation and because little is known on the role of ephrin B1 reverse signaling in bone resorption, we examined the bone phenotypes in ephrin B1 conditional knockout mice, and studied the function of ephrin B1 reverse signaling on osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity. Targeted deletion of ephrin B1 gene in myeloid lineage cells resulted in reduced trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness caused by increased TRAP positive osteoclasts and bone resorption. Histomorphometric analyses found bone formation parameters were not changed in ephrin B1 knockout mice. Treatment of wild-type precursors with clustered soluble EphB2-Fc inhibited RANKL induced formation of multinucleated osteoclasts, and bone resorption pits. The same treatment of ephrin B1 deficient precursors had little effect on osteoclast differentiation and pit formation. Similarly, activation of ephrin B1 reverse signaling by EphB2-Fc treatment led to inhibition of TRAP, cathepsin K and NFATc1 mRNA expression in osteoclasts derived from wild-type mice but not conditional knockout mice. Immunoprecipitation with NHERF1 antibody revealed ephrin B1 interacted with NHERF1 in differentiated osteoclasts. Treatment of osteoclasts with exogenous EphB2-Fc resulted in reduced phosphorylation of ezrin/radixin/moesin. We conclude that myeloid lineage produced ephrin B1 is a negative regulator of bone resorption in vivo, and that activation of ephrin B1 reverse signaling inhibits osteoclast differentiation in vitro in part via a mechanism that involves inhibition of NFATc1 expression and modulation of phosphorylation status of ezrin/radixin/moesin."
https://openalex.org/W2128414543,"Despite improved outcomes in the past 30 years, less than half of all women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer live five years beyond their diagnosis. Although typically treated as a single disease, epithelial ovarian cancer includes several distinct histological subtypes, such as papillary serous and endometrioid carcinomas. To address whether the morphological differences seen in these carcinomas represent distinct characteristics at the molecular level we analyzed DNA methylation patterns in 11 papillary serous tumors, 9 endometrioid ovarian tumors, 4 normal fallopian tube samples and 6 normal endometrial tissues, plus 8 normal fallopian tube and 4 serous samples from TCGA. For comparison within the endometrioid subtype we added 6 primary uterine endometrioid tumors and 5 endometrioid metastases from uterus to ovary. Data was obtained from 27,578 CpG dinucleotides occurring in or near promoter regions of 14,495 genes. We identified 36 locations with significant increases or decreases in methylation in comparisons of serous tumors and normal fallopian tube samples. Moreover, unsupervised clustering techniques applied to all samples showed three major profiles comprising mostly normal samples, serous tumors, and endometrioid tumors including ovarian, uterine and metastatic origins. The clustering analysis identified 60 differentially methylated sites between the serous group and the normal group. An unrelated set of 25 serous tumors validated the reproducibility of the methylation patterns. In contrast, >1,000 genes were differentially methylated between endometrioid tumors and normal samples. This finding is consistent with a generalized regulatory disruption caused by a methylator phenotype. Through DNA methylation analyses we have identified genes with known roles in ovarian carcinoma etiology, whereas pathway analyses provided biological insight to the role of novel genes. Our finding of differences between serous and endometrioid ovarian tumors indicates that intervention strategies could be developed to specifically address subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2074835068,"The local translation of β-actin is one mechanism proposed to regulate spatially-restricted actin polymerization crucial for nearly all aspects of neuronal development and function. However, the physiological significance of localized β-actin translation in neurons has not yet been demonstrated in vivo. To investigate the role of β-actin in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), we characterized brain structure and function in a CNS-specific β-actin knock-out mouse (CNS-ActbKO). β-actin was rapidly ablated in the embryonic mouse brain, but total actin levels were maintained through upregulation of other actin isoforms during development. CNS-ActbKO mice exhibited partial perinatal lethality while survivors presented with surprisingly restricted histological abnormalities localized to the hippocampus and cerebellum. These tissue morphology defects correlated with profound hyperactivity as well as cognitive and maternal behavior impairments. Finally, we also identified localized defects in axonal crossing of the corpus callosum in CNS-ActbKO mice. These restricted defects occurred despite the fact that primary neurons lacking β-actin in culture were morphologically normal. Altogether, we identified novel roles for β-actin in promoting complex CNS tissue architecture while also demonstrating that distinct functions for the ubiquitously expressed β-actin are surprisingly restricted in vivo."

Therefore, the development of inexpensive antiviral products for the prevention and/or treatment of rotavirus disease remains a priority. Previously we have shown that a recombinant monovalent antibody fragment (referred to as Anti-Rotavirus Proteins or ARP1) derived from a heavy chain antibody of a llama immunised with rotavirus was able to neutralise rotavirus infection in a mouse model system. In the present work we investigated the specificity and neutralising activity of two llama antibody fragments, ARP1 and ARP3, against 13 cell culture adapted rotavirus strains of diverse genotypes. In addition, immunocapture electron microscopy (IEM) was performed to determine binding of ARP1 to clinical isolates and cell culture adapted strains. ARP1 and ARP3 were able to neutralise a broad variety of rotavirus serotypes/genotypes in vitro, and in addition, IEM showed specific binding to a variety of cell adapted strains as well as strains from clinical specimens. These results indicated that these molecules could potentially be used as immunoprophylactic and/or immunotherapeutic products for the prevention and/or treatment of infection of a broad range of clinically relevant rotavirus strains."
https://openalex.org/W2079649610,"A subset of sensory neurons embedded within the Drosophila larval body wall have been characterized as high-threshold polymodal nociceptors capable of responding to noxious heat and noxious mechanical stimulation. They are also sensitized by UV-induced tissue damage leading to both thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia very similar to that observed in vertebrate nociceptors. We show that the class IV multiple-dendritic(mdIV) nociceptors are also required for a normal larval aversion to locomotion on to a dry surface environment. Drosophila melanogaster larvae are acutely susceptible to desiccation displaying a strong aversion to locomotion on dry surfaces severely limiting the distance of movement away from a moist food source. Transgenic inactivation of mdIV nociceptor neurons resulted in larvae moving inappropriately into regions of low humidity at the top of the vial reflected as an increased overall pupation height and larval desiccation. This larval lethal desiccation phenotype was not observed in wild-type controls and was completely suppressed by growth in conditions of high humidity. Transgenic hyperactivation of mdIV nociceptors caused a reciprocal hypersensitivity to dry surfaces resulting in drastically decreased pupation height but did not induce the writhing nocifensive response previously associated with mdIV nociceptor activation by noxious heat or harsh mechanical stimuli. Larvae carrying mutations in either the Drosophila TRP channel, Painless, or the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel subunit Pickpocket1(PPK1), both expressed in mdIV nociceptors, showed the same inappropriate increased pupation height and lethal desiccation observed with mdIV nociceptor inactivation. Larval aversion to dry surfaces appears to utilize the same or overlapping sensory transduction pathways activated by noxious heat and harsh mechanical stimulation but with strikingly different sensitivities and disparate physiological responses."

The aim of the study was to investigate whether hypoxemic resuscitation attenuates liver injury.Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated New Zealand white rabbits were exsanguinated to a mean arterial pressure of 30 mmHg for 60 minutes. Resuscitation under normoxemia (Normox-Res group, n = 16, PaO(2) = 95-105 mmHg) or hypoxemia (Hypox-Res group, n = 15, PaO(2) = 35-40 mmHg) followed, modifying the FiO(2). Animals not subjected to shock constituted the sham group (n = 11, PaO(2) = 95-105 mmHg). Indices of the inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative response were measured and histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of the liver were performed.Normox-Res group animals exhibited increased serum alanine aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor--alpha, interleukin (IL) -1β and IL-6 levels compared with Hypox-Res and sham groups. Reactive oxygen species generation, malondialdehyde formation and myeloperoxidase activity were all elevated in Normox-Res rabbits compared with Hypox-Res and sham groups. Similarly, endothelial NO synthase and inducible NO synthase mRNA expression was up-regulated and nitrotyrosine immunostaining increased in animals resuscitated normoxemically, indicating a more intense nitrosative stress. Hypox-Res animals demonstrated a less prominent histopathologic injury which was similar to sham animals.Hypoxemic resuscitation prevents liver reperfusion injury through attenuation of the inflammatory response and oxidative and nitrosative stresses."
https://openalex.org/W1997569677,"Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) and intra abdominal hypertension(IAH) are common clinical findings in patients with severe acute pancreatitis(SAP). It is thought that an increased intra abdominal pressure(IAP) is associated with poor prognosis in SAP patients. But the detailed effect of IAH/ACS on different organ system is not clear. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of SAP combined with IAH on hemodynamics, systemic oxygenation, and organ damage in a 12 h lasting porcine model.Following baseline registrations, a total of 30 animals were divided into 5 groups (6 animals in each group): SAP+IAP30 group, SAP+IAP20 group, SAP group, IAP30 group(sham-operated but without SAP) and sham-operated group. We used a N(2) pneumoperitoneum to induce different levels of IAH and retrograde intra-ductal infusion of sodium taurocholate to induce SAP. The investigation period was 12 h. Hemodynamic parameters (CO, HR, MAP, CVP), urine output, oxygenation parameters(e.g., S(v)O(2), PO(2), PaCO(2)), peak inspiratory pressure, as well as serum parameters (e.g., ALT, amylase, lactate, creatinine) were recorded. Histological examination of liver, intestine, pancreas, and lung was performed.Cardiac output significantly decreased in the SAP+IAH animals compared with other groups. Furthermore, AST, creatinine, SUN and lactate showed similar increasing tendency paralleled with profoundly decrease in S(v)O(2). The histopathological analyses also revealed higher grade injury of liver, intestine, pancreas and lung in the SAP+IAH groups. However, few differences were found between the two SAP+IAH groups with different levels of IAP.Our newly developed porcine SAP+IAH model demonstrated that there were remarkable effects on global hemodynamics, oxygenation and organ function in response to sustained IAH of 12 h combined with SAP. Moreover, our model should be helpful to study the mechanisms of IAH/ACS-induced exacerbation and to optimize the treatment strategies for counteracting the development of organ dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2031867580,"Pattern formation in developing tissues involves dynamic spatio-temporal changes in cellular organization and subsequent evolution of functional adult structures. Branching morphogenesis is a developmental mechanism by which patterns are generated in many developing organs, which is controlled by underlying molecular pathways. Understanding the relationship between molecular signaling, cellular behavior and resulting morphological change requires quantification and categorization of the cellular behavior. In this study, tissue-level and cellular changes in developing salivary gland in response to disruption of ROCK-mediated signaling by are modeled by building cell-graphs to compute mathematical features capturing structural properties at multiple scales. These features were used to generate multiscale cell-graph signatures of untreated and ROCK signaling disrupted salivary gland organ explants. From confocal images of mouse submandibular salivary gland organ explants in which epithelial and mesenchymal nuclei were marked, a multiscale feature set capturing global structural properties, local structural properties, spectral, and morphological properties of the tissues was derived. Six feature selection algorithms and multiway modeling of the data was performed to identify distinct subsets of cell graph features that can uniquely classify and differentiate between different cell populations. Multiscale cell-graph analysis was most effective in classification of the tissue state. Cellular and tissue organization, as defined by a multiscale subset of cell-graph features, are both quantitatively distinct in epithelial and mesenchymal cell types both in the presence and absence of ROCK inhibitors. Whereas tensor analysis demonstrate that epithelial tissue was affected the most by inhibition of ROCK signaling, significant multiscale changes in mesenchymal tissue organization were identified with this analysis that were not identified in previous biological studies. We here show how to define and calculate a multiscale feature set as an effective computational approach to identify and quantify changes at multiple biological scales and to distinguish between different states in developing tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2084469023,"Mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene have become an important identifier for the Philadelphia-chromosome negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. In contrast to the JAK2V617F mutation, the large number of JAK2 exon 12 mutations has challenged the development of quantitative assays. We present a highly sensitive real-time quantitative PCR assay for determination of the mutant allele burden of JAK2 exon 12 mutations. In combination with high resolution melting analysis and sequencing the assay identified six patients carrying previously described JAK2 exon 12 mutations and one novel mutation. Two patients were homozygous with a high mutant allele burden, whereas one of the heterozygous patients had a very low mutant allele burden. The allele burden in the peripheral blood resembled that of the bone marrow, except for the patient with low allele burden. Myeloid and lymphoid cell populations were isolated by cell sorting and quantitative PCR revealed similar mutant allele burdens in CD16+ granulocytes and peripheral blood. The mutations were also detected in B-lymphocytes in half of the patients at a low allele burden. In conclusion, our highly sensitive assay provides an important tool for quantitative monitoring of the mutant allele burden and accordingly also for determining the impact of treatment with interferon-α-2, shown to induce molecular remission in JAK2V617F-positive patients, which may be a future treatment option for JAK2 exon 12-positive patients as well."

The yeast cells underwent apoptosis as determined by testing for apoptotic markers of DNA cleavage and typical chromatin condensation by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and 4,6'-diaminidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and electron microscopy. The changes of ΔΨmt (mitochondrial transmembrane potential) and ROS (reactive oxygen species) indicated that the mitochondria took part in the apoptotic process. Changes in this process detected by metabonomics and proteomics revealed that the yeast cells tenaciously resisted adversity. Proteins related to redox, cellular structure, membrane, energy and DNA repair were significantly increased. In this study, the relative changes in the levels of proteins and metabolites showed the tenacious resistance of yeast cells. However, GSE induced apoptosis in the yeast cells by destruction of the mitochondrial 60 S ribosomal protein, L14-A, and prevented the conversion of pantothenic acid to coenzyme A (CoA). The relationship between the proteins and metabolites was analyzed by orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS). We found that the changes of the metabolites and the protein changes had relevant consistency."
https://openalex.org/W2071857021,"Epigenetic marks are fundamental to normal development, but little is known about signals that dictate their placement. Insights have been provided by studies of imprinted loci in mammals, where monoallelic expression is epigenetically controlled. Imprinted expression is regulated by DNA methylation programmed during gametogenesis in a sex-specific manner and maintained after fertilization. At Rasgrf1 in mouse, paternal-specific DNA methylation on a differential methylation domain (DMD) requires downstream tandem repeats. The DMD and repeats constitute a binary switch regulating paternal-specific expression. Here, we define sequences sufficient for imprinted methylation using two transgenic mouse lines: One carries the entire Rasgrf1 cluster (RC); the second carries only the DMD and repeats (DR) from Rasgrf1. The RC transgene recapitulated all aspects of imprinting seen at the endogenous locus. DR underwent proper DNA methylation establishment in sperm and erasure in oocytes, indicating the DMD and repeats are sufficient to program imprinted DNA methylation in germlines. Both transgenes produce a DMD-spanning pit-RNA, previously shown to be necessary for imprinted DNA methylation at the endogenous locus. We show that when pit-RNA expression is controlled by the repeats, it regulates DNA methylation in cis only and not in trans. Interestingly, pedigree history dictated whether established DR methylation patterns were maintained after fertilization. When DR was paternally transmitted followed by maternal transmission, the unmethylated state that was properly established in the female germlines could not be maintained. This provides a model for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2070623722,"Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is traditionally used as an indicator for the presence of prostate cancer (PCa) and radiotherapy is generally used to treat inoperable and locally advanced PCa. However, how cellular PSA level is associated with sensitivity of PCa to radiotherapy is unknown. The previous finding that the RelB-based NF-κB alternative pathway differentially regulates PSA and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in aggressive PCa has directed our attention to the role of RelB in the response of PCa to radiotherapy.RelB and its targets PSA and IL-8 in PCa cells were manipulated by ectopic expression in PCa cells with a low endogenous level of RelB (LNCaP) and by RNAi-based knock-down in PCa cells with a high constitutive level of RelB (PC3). The effects of RelB, PSA and IL-8 on the response of PCa to radiation treatment were examined in vitro and in xenograft tumors. RelB regulates PSA and IL-8 in an inverse manner. When the cellular levels of PSA and IL-8 were directly modulated by genetic manipulations or by the addition of recombinant proteins, the results demonstrate that up-regulation of IL-8 enhanced radioresistance of PCa cells and concurrently down-regulated PSA. In contrast, up-regulation of PSA resulted in reduced radioresistance with concurrent down-regulation of IL-8.RelB plays a critical role in the response of PCa to radiotherapy and the inverse expression of IL-8 and PSA. The results identify a previously unrecognized relationship between IL-8 and PSA in the response of PCa cells to radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2154155429,"Although a few pelagic species exhibit regional endothermy, most fish are regarded as ectotherms. However, we document significant regional endothermy in a benthic reef fish. Individual steephead parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos (Labridae, formerly Scaridae) were tagged and their internal temperatures were monitored for a 24 h period using active acoustic telemetry. At night, on the reef, C. microrhinos were found to maintain a consistent average peritoneal cavity temperature 0.16±0.005°C (SE) warmer than ambient. Diurnal internal temperatures were highly variable for individuals monitored on the reef, while in tank-based trials, peritoneal cavity temperatures tracked environmental temperatures. The mechanisms responsible for a departure of the peritoneal cavity temperature from environmental temperature occurred in C. microrhinos are not yet understood. However, the diet and behavior of the species suggests that heat in the peritoneal cavity may result primarily from endogenous thermogenesis coupled with physiological heat retention mechanisms. The presence of limited endothermy in C. microrhinos indicates that a degree of uncertainty may exist in the manner that reef fish respond to their thermal environment. At the very least, they do not always appear to respond to environmental temperatures as neutral thermal vessels and do display limited, but significant, visceral warming."
