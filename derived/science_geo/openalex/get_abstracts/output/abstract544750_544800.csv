https://openalex.org/W2155980822,"Exosomes are cell-derived extracellular vesicles thought to promote intercellular communication by delivering specific content to target cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether endothelial cell (EC)-derived exosomes could regulate the phenotype of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Initial microarray studies showed that fibroblast growth factor 2 induced a 2.4-fold increase in mRNA levels of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1). Exosomes derived from an SK1-overexpressing EC line increased HSC migration 3.2-fold. Migration was not conferred by the dominant negative SK1 exosome. Incubation of HSCs with exosomes was also associated with an 8.3-fold increase in phosphorylation of AKT and 2.5-fold increase in migration. Exosomes were found to express the matrix protein and integrin ligand fibronectin (FN) by Western blot analysis and transmission electron microscopy. Blockade of the FN-integrin interaction with a CD29 neutralizing antibody or the RGD peptide attenuated exosome-induced HSC AKT phosphorylation and migration. Inhibition of endocytosis with transfection of dynamin siRNA, the dominant negative dynamin GTPase construct Dyn2K44A, or the pharmacological inhibitor Dynasore significantly attenuated exosome-induced AKT phosphorylation. SK1 levels were increased in serum exosomes derived from mice with experimental liver fibrosis, and SK1 mRNA levels were up-regulated 2.5-fold in human liver cirrhosis patient samples. Finally, S1PR2 inhibition protected mice from CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Therefore, EC-derived SK1-containing exosomes regulate HSC signaling and migration through FN-integrin-dependent exosome adherence and dynamin-dependent exosome internalization. These findings advance our understanding of EC/HSC cross-talk and identify exosomes as a potential target to attenuate pathobiology signals."

We previously determined a metabolite of acetamiprid, N-desmethyl-acetamiprid in the urine of a patient, who exhibited some typical symptoms including neurological findings. We sought to investigate the association between urinary N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and the symptoms by a prevalence case-control study. Spot urine samples were collected from 35 symptomatic patients of unknown origin and 50 non-symptomatic volunteers (non-symptomatic group, NSG, 4–87 year-old). Patients with recent memory loss, finger tremor, and more than five of six symptoms (headache, general fatigue, palpitation/chest pain, abdominal pain, muscle pain/weakness/spasm, and cough) were in the typical symptomatic group (TSG, n = 19, 5–69 year-old); the rest were in the atypical symptomatic group (ASG, n = 16, 5–78 year-old). N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and six neonicotinoids in the urine were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The detection of N-desmethyl-acetamiprid was the most frequent and highest in TSG (47.4%, 6.0 ppb (frequency, maximum)), followed by in ASG (12.5%, 4.4 ppb) and in NSG (6.0%, 2.2 ppb), however acetamiprid was not detected. Thiamethoxam was detected in TSG (31.6%, 1.4 ppb), in ASG (6.3%, 1.9 ppb), but not in NSG. Nitenpyram was detected in TSG (10.5%, 1.2 ppb), in ASG (6.3%, not quantified) and in NSG (2.0%, not quantified). Clothianidin was only detected in ASG (6.3%, not quantified), and in NSG (2.0%, 1.6 ppb). Thiacloprid was detected in ASG (6.3%, 0.1 ppb). The cases in TSG with detection of N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and thiamethoxam were aged 5 to 62 years and 13 to 62 years, respectively. Detection of N-desmethyl-acetamiprid was associated with increased prevalence of the symptoms (odds ratio: 14, 95% confidence interval: 3.5–57). Urinary N-desmethyl-acetamiprid can be used as a biomarker for environmental exposure to acetamiprid. Further multi-centered clinical research in larger patients groups with more metabolites analysis is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2225727186,"DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism controlling DNA accessibility and gene expression. Blockade of DNA methylation can significantly affect pain behaviors implicated in neuropathic and inflammatory pain. However, the role of DNA methylation with regard to postoperative pain has not yet been explored. In this study we sought to investigate the role of DNA methylation in modulating incisional pain and identify possible targets under DNA methylation and contributing to incisional pain. DNA methyltranferase (DNMT) inhibitor 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine significantly reduced incision-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal sensitivity. Aza-2′-deoxycytidine also reduced hindpaw swelling after incision, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. Global DNA methylation and DNMT3b expression were increased in skin after incision, but none of DNMT1, DNMT3a or DNMT3b was altered in spinal cord or DRG. The expression of proopiomelanocortin Pomc encoding β-endorphin and Oprm1 encoding the mu-opioid receptor were upregulated peripherally after incision; moreover, Oprm1 expression was further increased under DNMT inhibitor treatment. Finally, local peripheral injection of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone significantly exacerbated incision-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. These results suggest that DNA methylation is functionally relevant to incisional nociceptive sensitization, and that mu-opioid receptor signaling might be one methylation regulated pathway controlling sensitization after incision."
https://openalex.org/W2136535612,"Urticaceae is a family with more than 2000 species, which contains remarkable morphological diversity. It has undergone many taxonomic reorganizations, and is currently the subject of further systematic studies. To gain more resolution in systematic studies and to better understand the general patterns of character evolution in Urticaceae, based on our previous phylogeny including 169 accessions comprising 122 species across 47 Urticaceae genera, we examined 19 diagnostic characters, and analysed these employing both maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood approaches. Our results revealed that 16 characters exhibited multiple state changes within the family, with ten exhibiting >eight changes and three exhibiting between 28 and 40. Morphological synapomorphies were identified for many clades, but the diagnostic value of these was often limited due to reversals within the clade and/or homoplasies elsewhere. Recognition of the four clades comprising the family at subfamily level can be supported by a small number carefully chosen defining traits for each. Several non-monophyletic genera appear to be defined only by characters that are plesiomorphic within their clades, and more detailed work would be valuable to find defining traits for monophyletic clades within these. Some character evolution may be attributed to adaptive evolution in Urticaceae due to shifts in habitat or vegetation type. This study demonstrated the value of using phylogeny to trace character evolution, and determine the relative importance of morphological traits for classification."
https://openalex.org/W2122250184,"The late Campanian-early Maastrichtian site of Lo Hueco (Cuenca, Spain) has provided a set of well-preserved crocodyliform skull and lower jaw remains, which are described here and assigned to a new basal eusuchian taxon, Lohuecosuchus megadontos gen. et sp. nov. The reevaluation of a complete skull from the synchronous site of Fox-Amphoux (Department of Var, France) allows us to define a second species of this new genus. Phylogenetic analysis places Lohuecosuchus in a clade exclusively composed by European Late Cretaceous taxa. This new clade, defined here as Allodaposuchidae, is recognized as the sister group of Hylaeochampsidae, also comprised of European Cretaceous forms. Allodaposuchidae and Hylaeochampsidae are grouped in a clade identified as the sister group of Crocodylia, the only crocodyliform lineage that reaches our days. Allodaposuchidae shows a vicariant distribution pattern in the European Late Cretaceous archipelago, with several Ibero-Armorican forms more closely related to each other than with to Romanian Allodaposuchus precedens."
https://openalex.org/W2124620185,"Although older people are particularly liable to sarcopenia, limited research is available on beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation in this population, particularly in healthy subjects. In this parallel-group, randomized, controlled, open-label trial, we aimed to evaluate whether an oral supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks could improve physical performance and muscle strength parameters in a group of community-dwelling healthy older women. Eighty healthy women attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program were divided into two equal groups of 40, and 32 of the treated women and 33 control completed the study. We considered a change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score as the primary outcome and changes in the peak torque (PT) isometric and isokinetic strength of the lower limbs, 6-minute walking test (6MWT), handgrip strength and endurance as secondary outcomes. Body composition was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). The mean difference between the two groups on pre-post change were finally calculated (delta) for each outcome. After 8 weeks, there were no significant differences between the groups’ SPPB, handgrip strength or DXA parameters. The group treated with HMB scored significantly better than the control group for PT isokinetic flexion (delta = 1.56±1.56 Nm; p = 0.03) and extension (delta = 3.32±2.61 Nm; p = 0.03), PT isometric strength (delta = 9.74±3.90 Nm; p = 0.02), 6MWT (delta = 7.67±8.29 m; p = 0.04), handgrip endurance (delta = 21.41±16.28 s; p = 0.02), and muscle density assessed with pQCT. No serious adverse effects were reported in either group. In conclusion, a nutritional supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks in healthy elderly women had no significant effects on SPPB, but did significantly improve several muscle strength and physical performance parameters.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02118181."
https://openalex.org/W2271258538,"We examined tree-soil habitat associations in lowland forest communities at Paracou, French Guiana. We analyzed a large dataset assembling six permanent plots totaling 37.5 ha, in which extensive LIDAR-derived topographical data and soil chemical and physical data have been integrated with precise botanical determinations. Map of relative elevation from the nearest stream summarized both soil fertility and hydromorphic characteristics, with seasonally inundated bottomlands having higher soil phosphate content and base saturation, and plateaus having higher soil carbon, nitrogen and aluminum contents. We employed a statistical test of correlations between tree species density and environmental maps, by generating Monte Carlo simulations of random raster images that preserve autocorrelation of the original maps. Nearly three fourths of the 94 taxa with at least one stem per ha showed a significant correlation between tree density and relative elevation, revealing contrasted species-habitat associations in term of abundance, with seasonally inundated bottomlands (24.5% of species) and well-drained plateaus (48.9% of species). We also observed species preferences for environments with or without steep slopes (13.8% and 10.6%, respectively). We observed that closely-related species were frequently associated with different soil habitats in this region (70% of the 14 genera with congeneric species that have a significant association test) suggesting species-habitat associations have arisen multiple times in this tree community. We also tested if species with similar habitat preferences shared functional strategies. We found that seasonally inundated forest specialists tended to have smaller stature (maximum diameter) than species found on plateaus. Our results underline the importance of tree-soil habitat associations in structuring diverse communities at fine spatial scales and suggest that additional studies are needed to disentangle community assembly mechanisms related to dispersal limitation, biotic interactions and environmental filtering from species-habitat associations. Moreover, they provide a framework to generalize across tropical forest sites."
https://openalex.org/W1945527530,"The distributions of endosulfan (ED) residues (α-, β-isomers, and sulfate-metabolite) in cucumbers grown in soils treated with ED at concentrations of 20 and 40 mg kg-1 were assessed using indoor and outdoor experiments. In all treatments, degradation rates of the α-isomer in soils were higher than that of the β-isomer. In the indoor tests, uptake amounts of total ED by cucumbers, after 15 d of growth, were 7.8 and 14.5 mg kg-1 in 20 and 40 mg kg-1-treated pots, respectively. For growth time from 15 to 30 d, uptake amounts in 20 and 40 mg kg-1-treated pots were 3.8 and 7.9 mg kg-1, respectively. Outdoor tests resulted in smaller ED residues in cucumbers than those in indoor tests. In both indoor and outdoor tests, ED residues absorbed were highest in roots, and the α-isomer was the more frequently absorbed isomer. These results will be useful for determining management criteria for soil persistent pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W2133754427,"We have used bioorthogonal click chemistry (BCC), a sensitive non-isotopic labeling method, to analyze the palmitoylation status of the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) crucial for regulation of processes such as mood, reward, and motor control. By analyzing a series of D2R constructs containing mutations in cysteine residues, we found that palmitoylation of the D2R most likely occurs on the C-terminal cysteine residue (C443) of the polypeptide. D2Rs in which C443 was deleted showed significantly reduced palmitoylation levels, plasma membrane expression, and protein stability compared to wild-type D2Rs. Rather, the C443 deletion mutant appeared to accumulate in the Golgi, indicating that palmitoylation of the D2R is important for cell surface expression of the receptor. Using the full-length D2R as bait in a membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) screen, we identified the palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) zDHHC4 as a D2R interacting protein. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that several other PATs, including zDHHC3 and zDHHC8, also interacted with the D2R and that each of the three PATs was capable of affecting the palmitoylation status of the D2R. Finally, biochemical analyses using D2R mutants and the palmitoylation blocker, 2-bromopalmitate indicate that palmitoylation of the receptor plays a role in stability of the D2R."
https://openalex.org/W2159322469,"Incorporating warming disturbances into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) is fundamental to developing appropriate conservation actions that confer coral reef resilience. We propose an MPA design approach that includes spatially- and temporally-varying sea-surface temperature (SST) data, integrating both observed (1985-2009) and projected (2010-2099) time-series. We derived indices of acute (time under reduced ecosystem function following short-term events) and chronic thermal stress (rate of warming) and combined them to delineate thermal-stress regimes. Coral reefs located on the Brazilian coast were used as a case study because they are considered a conservation priority in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. We show that all coral reef areas in Brazil have experienced and are projected to continue to experience chronic warming, while acute events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. We formulated quantitative conservation objectives for regimes of thermal stress. Based on these objectives, we then evaluated if/how they are achieved in existing Brazilian MPAs and identified priority areas where additional protection would reinforce resilience. Our results show that, although the current system of MPAs incorporates locations within some of our thermal-stress regimes, historical and future thermal refugia along the central coast are completely unprotected. Our approach is applicable to other marine ecosystems and adds to previous marine planning for climate change in two ways: (i) by demonstrating how to spatially configure MPAs that meet conservation objectives for warming disturbance using spatially- and temporally-explicit data; and (ii) by strategically allocating different forms of spatial management (MPA types) intended to mitigate warming impacts and also enhance future resistance to climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2170641020,"Staphylococcus aureus possesses a multitude of mechanisms by which it can obtain iron during growth under iron starvation conditions. It expresses an effective heme acquisition system (the iron-regulated surface determinant system), it produces two carboxylate-type siderophores staphyloferrin A and staphyloferrin B (SB), and it expresses transporters for many other siderophores that it does not synthesize. The ferric uptake regulator protein regulates expression of genes encoding all of these systems. Mechanisms of fine-tuning expression of iron-regulated genes, beyond simple iron regulation via ferric uptake regulator, have not been uncovered in this organism. Here, we identify the ninth gene of the sbn operon, sbnI, as encoding a ParB/Spo0J-like protein that is required for expression of genes in the sbn operon from sbnD onward. Expression of sbnD–I is drastically decreased in an sbnI mutant, and the mutant does not synthesize detectable SB during early phases of growth. Thus, SB-mediated iron acquisition is impaired in an sbnI mutant strain. We show that the protein forms dimers and tetramers in solution and binds to DNA within the sbnC coding region. Moreover, we show that SbnI binds heme and that heme-bound SbnI does not bind DNA. Finally, we show that providing exogenous heme to S. aureus growing in an iron-free medium results in delayed synthesis of SB.

On the iron requirement of lactobacilli grown in chemically defined medium.Curr. Microbiol. 1998; 37: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), S. aureus requires the use of iron to survive. Iron in a human host, however, is typically not free as it is bound within host proteins that serve essential host functions, and at the same time, it limits the amount of readily available iron to invading microbes (8Ratledge C.

This process of iron limitation is referred to as host nutritional immunity and is an obstacle to the survival of microbes, including S. aureus. To overcome this obstacle, S. aureus has evolved multiple sophisticated iron uptake mechanisms (10Hammer N.D. Skaar E.P. Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus iron acquisition.Annu. Rev.

Microbiol. 2014; 92: 824-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). l-Dap, citrate, and α-ketoglutarate are the constituents of SB. The siderophore synthetase enzymes SbnC, SbnE, and SbnF facilitate condensation reactions with these precursors to build the SB molecule, whereas SbnH is a decarboxylase that converts one of the two l-Dap molecules within SB into ethylenediamine (19Cheung J.

Microbiol. 2009; 74: 594-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The function of the terminal gene product in the sbn operon, SbnI, is previously uncharacterized, and thus the foundation of this study was to determine the function of SbnI in the cell. The regulation of genes that encode for proteins implicated in iron metabolism in S. aureus is controlled by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur), a transcriptional regulator found in many Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (29Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar). Functioning as a dimer and with the use of metal cofactors, Fur binds to an AT-rich 19-bp palindromic consensus sequence referred to as the Fur box, located in the promoter region of regulated genes. Fur bound to the Fur box results in limited transcription of downstream genes (29Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. Bacterial iron homeostasis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar, 30Fillat M.F. The fur (ferric uptake regulator) superfamily: diversity and versatility of key transcriptional regulators.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2014; 546: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the absence of Fur repression during growth in iron-starved conditions, some bacteria adopt additional regulatory mechanisms for fine-tuning gene expression of iron-regulated genes. In Ralstonia solanacearum, a soil-borne pathogen that also utilizes staphyloferrin B for iron acquisition, the synthesis of SB is negatively regulated by Fur in high iron concentrations and is also negatively regulated in low iron concentrations by PhcA (31Bhatt G. Denny T.P. Ralstonia solanacearum iron scavenging by the siderophore staphyloferrin B is controlled by PhcA, the global virulence regulator.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PhcA is an environmentally responsive transcription factor that responds to the presence of the autoinducer 3-hydroxypalmitic acid methyl ester, a molecule produced as a result of quorum sensing (31Bhatt G. Denny T.P. Ralstonia solanacearum iron scavenging by the siderophore staphyloferrin B is controlled by PhcA, the global virulence regulator.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Flavier A.B. Ganova-Raeva L.M. Schell M.A. Denny T.P. Hierarchical autoinduction in Ralstonia solanacearum: control of acyl-homoserine lactone production by a novel autoregulatory system responsive to 3-hydroxypalmitic acid methyl ester.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7089-7097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus PhcA is able to afford R. solanacearum as an additional level of control for siderophore synthesis that works in response to environmental cues. In S. aureus, however, it is unclear as to what regulates the expression of many genes implicated in iron metabolism when cells are growing in limited iron supply. In this study, we report a novel heme-responsive regulatory protein, SbnI, that controls expression of the genes in the sbn operon and thus controls siderophore-mediated iron uptake. The sbnI mutant had an SB-dependent growth defect in iron-limited media, because of delayed and reduced production of SB, due to significantly decreased transcript levels for genes sbnDEFGH in the mutant. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that SbnI binds DNA upstream of a newly identified promoter within the sbnC coding region. Moreover, we show that SbnI is capable of binding to heme and heme binding inhibits DNA binding. We propose a model whereby SbnI is required for transcription throughout the SB biosynthetic operon and senses intracellular heme as a means to reduce SB synthesis in favor of heme acquisition. This model supports the observations of Skaar et al. (12Skaar E.P. Humayun M. Bae T. DeBord K.L. Schneewind O. Iron-source preference of Staphylococcus aureus infections.Science. 2004; 305: 1626-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) who reported that heme is the preferred iron source for S. aureus. All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed and described in Table 1. Strains were stored in 15% glycerol stocks at −80 °C and, prior to use, were streaked onto tryptic soy broth (TSB) (Difco) agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic. Solid media were prepared with addition of 1.5% w/v Bacto agar (Difco).

The bacteria were then harvested, resuspended in fresh cTMS medium, and inoculated into 5 ml of cTMS medium (flask/volume ratio 10:1) to a starting A600 equivalent of 0.005. Rabbit polyclonal antisera recognized SbnI were generated by ProSci (Poway, CA) using the custom antibody production package number 1. Cells were grown to an A600 of 1.0, and 3 × 109 colony-forming units were harvested and resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm glucose, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5 μg of lysostaphin, 1× Laemmli buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue)) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then boiled for 10 min before being run through a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane following standard protocols. Primary anti-SbnI polyclonal antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:1000, and secondary antiserum (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to IRDye 800; Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) was used at a 1:20,000 dilution. Membranes were scanned on a Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imager (Li-Cor Biosciences) and visualized using Odyssey Version 3.0 software. S. aureus RN6390 and H984 (RN6390 sbnI) were grown in quadruplicate cultures in 2 ml of cTMS medium for 8 h. Cultures were then harvested and subcultured at A600 0.005 in 10 ml of cTMS and grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 ∼1.0). Cells equating to an A600 of 3.0 were harvested for each culture, and RNA extraction was performed by E.Z.N.A® total RNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of 0.25 μg/ml lysostaphin to the lysis solution. RNA purity was determined by agarose gel, and RNA concentration was determined by NanoDrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. cDNA preparation was performed using 500 ng of total cellular RNA reverse-transcribed using SuperscriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each qPCR, 1 μg of cDNA was amplified in a Rotor-Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science) using the iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). Gene expression for each sample was quantified in relation to rpoB expression. A standard curve was generated for each gene examined. Concentrated spent culture supernatants were prepared from 10-ml cultures of S. aureus RN6390. Culture supernatants were taken at 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 36 h after inoculation. Growth was assessed via A600, and culture densities between replicates and strains were normalized for each time point. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the supernatant was lyophilized for 12 h. Lyophilized supernatant was resuspended in 0.5 ml of sterile double-distilled H2O. S. aureus cells, the htsA mutant strain or the sirA mutant strain, were seeded into TMS agar containing 10 μm EDDHA to achieve 1 × 104 cells per ml. For each replicate, 10 μl of concentrated supernatant were applied to sterile paper discs that were then placed onto the plates containing the seeded reporter strains, and growth about the disc was measured after 24 and 48 h of incubation at 37 °C. Four DNA fragments, spanning the sbn operon from sbnA to sbnE, were cloned into the promoterless shuttle vector pGylux (33Mesak L.R. Yim G. Davies J.

To measure luciferase activity, individual colonies from S. aureus carrying these plasmids were inoculated into TMS medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently inoculated into cTMS with or without 1 μm FeCl3 at an A600 0.1 and incubated for 8 h. At that time, the A600 and luminescence were measured on a SynergyH4 Hybrid Reader (Biotek). Luminescence values were expressed as cps/A600. To identify an initiation of transcription, we used rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).

SIRPα ligation by a broadly expressed transmembrane protein, CD47, results in phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, resulting in the inhibition of NF-κB signaling in macrophages. Here we observed that proteolysis of SIRPα during inflammation is regulated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), resulting in the generation of a membrane-associated cleavage fragment in both THP-1 monocytes and human lung epithelia. We mapped a charge-dependent putative cleavage site near the membrane-proximal domain necessary for ADAM10-mediated cleavage. In addition, a secondary proteolytic cleavage within the membrane-associated SIRPα fragment by γ-secretase was identified. Ectopic expression of a SIRPα mutant plasmid encoding a proteolytically resistant form in HeLa cells inhibited activation of the NF-κB pathway and suppressed STAT1 phosphorylation in response to TNFα to a greater extent than expression of wild-type SIRPα. Conversely, overexpression of plasmids encoding the proteolytically cleaved SIRPα fragments in cells resulted in enhanced STAT-1 and NF-κB pathway activation. Thus, the data suggest that combinatorial actions of ADAM10 and γ-secretase on SIRPα cleavage promote inflammatory signaling.

Proteolysis and release of the SIRPα NH2-terminal domain has been demonstrated in primary cultured neurons, melanoma cells, and macrophage cell lines. Cleavage of murine SIRPα through an MMP inhibitor-sensitive pathway was first observed in cultured cells engineered to express both SIRPα and an active form of Ras (8Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H.

In these cells, blocking SIRPα proteolysis resulted in inhibited cell migration, cell spreading, and cytoskeletal reorganization. In addition, SIRPα was shown to regulate synaptic activity through activation of MMP inhibitor-sensitive proteolysis in primary murine neurons wherein the NH2-terminal domain of postsynaptic SIRPα promoted the maturation of the presynaptic terminal through a CD47-dependent mechanism (9Toth A.B.

However, the identification, characterization, and regulation of SIRPα cleavage products in inflammatory signaling have not been investigated in myeloid cells. In addition to SIRPα expression in brain tissue and in myeloid cells, SIRPα is also detected at lower levels in heart, placenta, lung, testis, ovary, colon, liver, small intestine, prostate, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. The role of SIRPα in the pulmonary epithelium has not been explored and may also play a role in the resolution of inflammatory lung injury. In these studies, we describe the role of proteolysis of SIRPα in response to proinflammatory stimuli. We determined that the inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) increase SIRPα proteolysis in a THP-1 human monocytic cell line and in human lung epithelial cells. We mapped a putative ADAM10 cleavage region within the extracellular juxtamembrane region and demonstrate a requirement for this enzyme for proteolysis of human SIRPα. Finally, we discovered that after primary proteolysis the SIRPα membrane-associated fragment is rapidly cleaved by γ-secretase where it is released into the cytosol. Cellular expression of plasmids encoding these SIRPα-derived putative fragments was observed to modulate cellular inflammatory signaling, thus providing a physiological role for SIRPα sequential proteolysis in human cells. THP-1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

A putative SIRPc+m ORF was generated based on our mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies and contains amino acids 359–504 of hSIRPα. SIRPcyto-C contains the entire COOH-terminal domain of SIRPα excluding the transmembrane domain (amino acids 398–504 of hSIRPα).

These include: ADAM10 DsiRNA 1: sense, 5′-CCAGCAGAGAGAUAUAUUAAAGACC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGUCUUUAAUAUAUCUCUCUGCUGGCU-3′; ADAM10 DsiRNA 2: sense, 5′-CCACUAAAGAUGAGUAAUUUGCUTA-3′; antisense, 5′-UAAGCAAAUUACUCAUCUUUAGUGGUU-3′; and ADAM10 DsiRNA 3: sense, 5′-GCAGAAUCAUGAUGACUACUGUUTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CAAACAGUAGUCAUCAUGAUUCUGCUC-3′. THP-1 and HeLa cells were transfected with 10–30 nm DsiRNA using GeneMute siRNA transfection reagent (SignaGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (10Chen B.B. Mallampalli R.K. Masking of a nuclear signal motif by monoubiquitination leads to mislocalization and degradation of the regulatory enzyme cytidylyltransferase.Mol. Cell.

Briefly, cells were lysed in PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific), and lysates were sonicated and then centrifuged at 500 × g to remove debris. An aliquot of sample containing total cellular protein was frozen at −80 °C. For subcellular fractionation, cells were also centrifuged at 16,000 × g to pellet membranes. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic protein was removed and stored at −80 °C. The resultant crude membrane pellet was resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, briefly sonicated, and stored at −80 °C. Total cellular, soluble, and membrane proteins were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for immunoblotting using the following antibodies SIRPα COOH-terminal antibody targeting amino acids 487–503 (566310, Millipore), SIRPα COOH-terminal antibody targeting residues surrounding Pro-413 (D613M, Cell Signaling Technology), V5 (Life Technologies), FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), GAPDH (Sigma), STAT-1 (9172P, Cell Signaling Technology), pSTAT1 (7649P, Cell Signaling Technology), ADAM10 (AB19026, EMD Millipore), and β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Immunoblots were exposed to SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). Extracellular proteins were isolated from culture medium that was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter unit with Ultracel-30 membrane (EMD Millipore) before processing for immunoblotting. HeLa cells were inoculated into glass-bottomed 35-mm plates and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. Cells were treated as indicated, washed with cold PBS twice, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min prior to incubation of the fixed cells with staining solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with 1% goat serum) for 30 min. The cells were then probed with a SIRPα COOH-terminal monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:300) or V5 antibody (Invitrogen) (1:300) in staining solution overnight. Plates were washed three times and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h. Plates were then washed three times for 10 min. DAPI was then added (1:5000) for 5 min. Images were acquired by a combination laser-scanning microscope system (Nikon A1, Nikon, Mellville, NY), and the results were analyzed using Nikon NIS-Elements software. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA103) were cultured as described previously (11Chen B.B. Coon T.A. Glasser J.R. Mallampalli R.K. Calmodulin antagonizes a calcium-activated SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit, FBXL2, to regulate surfactant homeostasis.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1905-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, inocula were freshly prepared prior to experiments from frozen stocks of PA103. Overnight plate cultures were then inoculated in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 1% glycerol and 100 mm sodium glutamate and grown by rotary shaking at 37 °C to log phase. Cells were infected with PA103 as described. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis for comparison of two groups. The comparison of statistical significance among three or more groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparisons using the Tukey t test. To determine the half-life of SIRPα, we incubated the human monocytic cell line THP-1 with the protein biosynthesis inhibitor CHX and measured protein lifespan; a t½ of ∼2 h was indicated (Fig. 1a). Although we observed a decrease in SIRPα protein in the presence of CHX, this turnover did not appear to be affected by either a lysosomal inhibitor, leupeptin, or a proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the full-length protein is processed by an alternative pathway. However, in these studies, we consistently detected the appearance of a faster migrating band at the expected size of a previously identified proteolytic fragment observed during MMP-mediated proteolysis of SIRPα that contains the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane domain, and a small portion of the extracellular domain. We termed this fragment SIRPc+m (Fig. 1b) (8Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H. Okazawa H. Ohe Y. Tomizawa K. Sato R. Matozaki T. Ectodomain shedding of SHPS-1 and its role in regulation of cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27878-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This fragment was visualized with antibodies to two different SIRPα COOH-terminal epitopes. Interestingly, SIRPc+m rapidly disappeared unless stabilized by the addition of MG132 in the culture medium and was visualized after prolonged exposure of immunoblots (Fig. 1, b and c). Leupeptin had no effect on SIRPc+m stability (Fig. 1c). We isolated THP-1 total membrane and cytoplasmic fractions to determine the localization of the MG132-preserved SIRPc+m fragment. SIRPc+m was enriched in the total membrane fraction, suggesting that it remained membrane-associated and that proteolysis likely occurred in the extracellular membrane-proximal domain (Fig. 1d). This is consistent with prior observations in murine SIRPα (8Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H. Okazawa H. Ohe Y. Tomizawa K. Sato R. Matozaki T. Ectodomain shedding of SHPS-1 and its role in regulation of cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27878-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because proteolysis of murine SIRPα is also enhanced by PMA stimulation (8Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H. Okazawa H. Ohe Y. Tomizawa K. Sato R. Matozaki T. Ectodomain shedding of SHPS-1 and its role in regulation of cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27878-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we incubated THP-1 with PMA and measured the degradation of full-length human SIRPα and the production of SIRPc+m. Degradation of full-length SIRPα and the appearance of SIRPc+m was dose-dependently increased by PMA (Fig. 1e). SIRPα proteolysis in RAW264.7 macrophages resulted in the production of a similar MG132-sensitive fragment (Fig. 1f). To determine whether SIRPα proteolysis plays a biologic role in macrophage signaling, we treated cells with the proinflammatory mediator LPS. In a time course analysis of SIRPα proteolysis in THP-1 cells, LPS treatment led to a decrease in abundance of full-length SIRPα at ∼1 h post-treatment, an effect that was inhibited by treatment of cells with a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, Compound 2 (12Ding D. Lichtenwalter K. Pi H. Mobashery S. Chang M. Characterization of a selective inhibitor for matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8).Medchemcomm. 2014; 5: 1381-1383Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 2a). Although it is reasonable to predict from the LPS-induced disappearance of full-length protein that SIRPc+m was being generated, this fragment was not readily detected again unless stabilized by MG132 treatment (Fig. 2a, lower blots). In comparative analysis of proteolysis of SIRPα, LPS and TNFα enhanced the accumulation of SIRPc+m in THP-1 cells to a similar extent as actions of PMA with appearance of a fragment identical to the PMA-generated product (Fig. 2b). With each stimulus, we were unable to observe the production of SIRPc+m without inclusion of MG132 in the culture medium to stabilize the fragment.FIGURE 2Inflammatory mediators trigger SIRPα proteolysis in monocytes. a, THP-1 cells were pretreated with DMSO (vehicle (Veh)) or Compound 2 (Comp 2).

(error bars)). **, p < 0.01 versus control (Con).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the site of proteolytic cleavage in human SIRPα, we generated a series of FLAG-tagged SIRPα mutants where we substituted amino acids in the full-length construct NH2-terminally adjacent to the transmembrane domain with the sequence DYDDDDK (Fig. 3a). This sequence of amino acids, termed FLAG tag, is recognized by commercially available antibodies. We then measured the association of the FLAG domain using a specific antibody that will either associate with the secreted NH2-terminal domain or the membrane-bound COOH-terminal domain depending on the site of proteolysis. If the cleavage site is upstream of the FLAG domain resulting in the FLAG epitope that is attached to the SIRPc+m domain, we should observe a reactive band at the size of the SIRPc+m fragment when probing with either the FLAG antibody or the SIRPα COOH-terminal antibody generated against residues 487–503 (Fig. 3b, left). Alternatively, if the site of cleavage is downstream of the inserted FLAG domain, the FLAG epitope will be associated with the secreted NH2-terminal domain without reactivity with the FLAG antibody when probing cell lysates. However, in this latter scenario, a FLAG-reactive band should be detected in the medium at the predicted size of the SIRPα cleaved fragment (Fig. 3b, right). Because HeLa cells are readily transfectable, we first evaluated whether overexpressed wild-type (WT) SIRPα was subject to proteolysis by analyzing production of the SIRPc+m fragment. As observed in THP-1, PMA enhanced the production of the SIRPc+m. MG132 also increased the abundance of SIRPc+m (Fig. 3c). HeLa cells were then transfected with the various FLAG-containing SIRPα plasmid constructs, and cells were then stimulated with PMA to activate proteolysis and MG132 to preserve the SIRPc+m fragment, respectively. Cell lysates were then processed for immunoblotting using a COOH-terminal SIRPα antibody or an anti-FLAG antibody. We observed that expression of only the FLAG site 1 construct in cells resulted in a FLAG-reactive band in the SIRPc+m fragment (Fig. 3d). Hence, these results suggest that SIRPα cleavage occurs between FLAG sites 1 and 2 (Fig. 3, a and d). Due to the lack of an acceptable antibody against the hSIRPα NH2-terminal domain, we chose to characterize the proteolysis and release of the SIRPα NH2-terminal domain using our FLAG insertional mutants. After determining that FLAG site 3 was not associated with the SIRPc+m domain and was cleaved normally, we transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding FLAG site 3 and examined proteolysis. PMA treatment of cells increased the appearance of the SIRPc+m fragment in cell lysates (Fig. 3e). We then confirmed the release of the SIRPα NH2 terminus into the medium by probing for the FLAG domain in the supernatants. PMA was sufficient to trigger the release of the SIRPα NH2-terminal domain into the culture medium, an effect abrogated by MMP inhibition (Fig. 3e). Although MG132 significantly increased the stability of SIRPc+m, it had little effect on the abundance of the extracellular fragment, suggesting that proteolysis itself is not altered by MG132. Thus, these data suggest that SIRPα is indeed clipped, resulting in the generation of both an extracellular released NH2-terminal fragment and a membrane-associated cleavage product. Having determined that the approximate site of proteolysis was between FLAG sites 1 and 2, we introduced a FLAG tag between these two regions (termed SIRPα FLAG site 1.5). Compared with expression of the FLAG site 1 and 2 constructs, cellular expression of the SIRPα FLAG site 1.5 variant dramatically inhibited both the appearance of SIRPc+m and the extracellular release of the SIRPα NH2-terminal domain (Fig. 3f). Because alterations near the transmembrane domain could potentially disrupt protein folding or trafficking, we performed immunofluorescence imaging to characterize the membrane localization of FLAG site 1.5 after cellular expression. In HeLa cells, both the WT SIRPα and the FLAG site 1.5 mutant appear to associate with the plasma membrane to a similar extent (Fig. 3g). To further ascertain the specific molecular attack sites for SIRPα cleavage, we generated a series of point mutations within the FLAG domain of SIRPα based on predictions of which motifs may be important. Substitution of Ala at residue 359 did not alter cutting, but substitution of Lys at residue 359 enhanced proteolysis. Substitution of Ser-358 and Thr-360 with negatively charged residues resulted in reduced SIRPα proteolysis (data not shown). Because of these results and because the FLAG tags are enriched with negatively charged residues, we hypothesized that the inhibition of proteolysis by the FLAG site 1.5 domain was charge-mediated. Therefore, we generated additional FLAG mutant constructs retaining only the negatively charged Asp residues (Fig. 4a). FLAG site 1.5, FLAG-D1, and FLAG-D2 constructs effectively blocked SIRPα proteolysis compared with the WT FLAG domain (Fig. 4b). In contrast, replacing the same residues with a series of basic positively charged residues (Arg) (FLAG-R) drastically enhanced proteolysis, resulting in enhanced accumulation of the SIRPc+m product (Fig. 4b). Because the site of cleavage we identified was flanked by two negatively charged Glu residues, we hypothesized that a centrally placed negative residue should significantly limit SIRPα cleavage. Mutagenesis of Asn-359 to a negatively charged residue (Asp or Glu) greatly reduced SIRPα proteolysis under baseline and PMA-induced conditions (Fig. 4, c and d). In contrast, replacement of Asn-359 with a positively charged residue (Lys or Arg) enhanced proteolysis reflected primarily by loss of the parent SIRPα (Fig. 4, c and d). Mutation of this residue to an uncharged amino acid had no major effect on proteolysis (Fig. 4, c and d). To further examine charge-dependent regulation of SIRPα, we analyzed proteolysis of mSIRPα to determine whether similar residues were important for cleavage. We transfected HeLa cells with plasmid encoding mSIRPα and measured PMA-mediated proteolysis. Like hSIRPα, mSIRPα was cleaved in response to PMA treatment, resulting in the production of a COOH-terminal fragment (Fig. 4e). In these studies, this fragment was subsequently determined to be cleaved by γ-secretase (see Fig. 6), and thus both MG132 and DAPT were used interchangeably as γ-secretase inhibitors to preserve the cleaved fragment. Murine SIRPα contains a Gln residue (Gln-361) in a similar location to the juxtamembrane Asn residue (Asn-359) in hSIRPα. Because mutation of the amide-containing amino acid Asn in hSIRPα drastically altered proteolysis, we made a series of point mutants near the Gln residue in mSIRPα, speculating that this residue may also be important for proteolysis (Fig. 4a). Consistent with our observations in hSIRPα, the introduction of negatively charged residues in place of Gln significantly inhibited mSIRPα proteolysis, whereas the substitution of a neutral amino acid, Ala, had no effect. The introduction of three Asp residues was even more efficient at inhibiting proteolysis, suggesting a charge-dependent cutting mechanism. These results suggest that charge-mediated proteolysis is conserved across species despite major differences in the juxtamembrane domain sequence (Fig. 4, a and e). Although cleavage of SIRPα is inhibited by broad spectrum MMP inhibitors, the specific protease(s) responsible has not been identified. Ohnishi et al. (8Ohnishi H. Kobayashi H. Okazawa H. Ohe Y. Tomizawa K. Sato R. Matozaki T. Ectodomain shedding of SHPS-1 and its role in regulation of cell migration.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27878-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggested that proteolysis of murine SIRPα might be MMP9-dependent. We therefore interrogated the role of MMP9 in THP-1 using a specific MMP2/9 inhibitor. Although the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (GM) blocked SIRPα degradation, the MMP2/9 inhibitor had no effect (Fig. 5a). PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, also had no effect on proteolysis. We then tested whether Compound 2, an MMP8 inhibitor, could block proteolysis because it had been shown previously to inhibit the disappearance of membrane SIRPα in apoptotic neutrophils (13Stenberg A. Sehlin J. Oldenborg P.A. Neutrophil apoptosis is associated with loss of signal regulatory protein α (SIRPα) from the cell surface.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2013; 93: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although Compound 2 was effective in inhibiting SIRPα cleavage, this antagonist was subsequently shown to be promiscuous, inhibiting many MMP and ADAM proteases (Fig. 5b) (12Ding D. Lichtenwalter K. Pi H. Mobashery S. Chang M. Characterization of a selective inhibitor for matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8).Medchemcomm. 2014; 5: 1381-1383Crossref Google Scholar). Given the membrane-proximal site and rapid onset of proteolysis, we hypothesized that the membrane-bound ADAM protease family member was likely responsible for SIRPα shedding (14Maretzky T. Evers A.

https://openalex.org/W2167601866,"Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation produces most of the energy in aerobic cells by coupling respiration to the production of ATP. Mitochondrial uncouplers, which reduce the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane, create a futile cycle of nutrient oxidation without generating ATP. Regulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and associated cellular bioenergetics has been recently identified as a promising target for anticancer therapy. Here, we show that SR4 is a novel mitochondrial uncoupler that causes dose-dependent increase in mitochondrial respiration and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. These effects were reversed by the recoupling agent 6-ketocholestanol but not cyclosporin A and were nonexistent in mitochondrial DNA-depleted HepG2 cells. In isolated mouse liver mitochondria, SR4 similarly increased oxygen consumption independent of adenine nucleotide translocase and uncoupling proteins, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoted swelling of valinomycin-treated mitochondria in potassium acetate medium. Mitochondrial uncoupling in HepG2 cells by SR4 results in the reduction of cellular ATP production, increased ROS production, activation of the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK, and inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Global analysis of SR4-associated differential gene expression confirms these observations, including significant induction of apoptotic genes and down-regulation of cell cycle, mitochondrial, and oxidative phosphorylation pathway transcripts at 24 h post-treatment. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that the previously reported indirect activation of AMPK and in vitro anticancer properties of SR4 as well as its beneficial effects in both animal xenograft and obese mice models could be a direct consequence of its mitochondrial uncoupling activity."

All participants were interviewed with the Child Eating Disorder Examination. Additionally, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire were administered to assess health-related functioning. Clinical data were obtained from the Norwegian Childhood Diabetes Registry.Significant gender differences were demonstrated in the pattern of correlates of eating disorder pathology. Among females, eating disorder psychopathology was significantly associated with body mass index adjusted for age and gender, age, insulin restriction, coping, illness perceptions, and perceptions of insulin concern. In a regression model, age, illness perceptions, and insulin restriction remained significantly associated with eating disorder psychopathology, explaining 48% of the variance. None of the variables were associated with eating disorder psychopathology among males.Greater clinical awareness of illness perceptions, attitudes toward insulin, and insulin restriction may potentially decrease the risk of developing eating disorders among female adolescents with type 1 diabetes, and the subsequent increased morbidity and mortality associated with comorbid type 1 diabetes and eating disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2233073363,"Hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by recurrent life-threatening oedemas and/or abdominal pain and caused by mutations affecting the C1 inhibitor gene, SERPING1. We sought to investigate the spectrum of SERPING1 mutations in Serbia and the possible genotype-phenotype association. C1-INH-HAE was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and laboratory criteria in 40 patients from 27 families; four were asymptomatic. Mutational analysis of the SERPING1 gene was performed by sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Disease-causing mutations in SERPING1 were identified in all patients. In C1-INH-HAE type I, we identified 19 different mutations, including 6 missense mutations, 6 nonsense mutations, 2 small deletions, 1 small insertion, 2 splicing defects and 2 large deletions. Two of the mutations (c.300C>T and c.1184_1185insTA) are reported here for the first time. All C1-INH-HAE type II patients from three families harboured the same substitution (c.1396C>T). Based on the type of mutation identified in the SERPING1 gene, patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (nonsense, frameshift, large deletions/insertions, splicing defect, and mutations at Arg444) or group 2 (missense, excluding mutations at Arg444). Significant differences were found in the clinical severity score (P = 0.005), prevalence of laryngeal (P = 0.040) and facial (P = 0.013) oedema, and long-term prophylaxis (P = 0.023) between the groups with different types of mutations. Because our population consisted of related subjects, differences in the severity score between mutation groups were further confirmed using the generalized estimating equation (P = 0.038). Our study identified 20 different disease-causing mutations, including two novel mutations, in all C1-INH-HAE patients, highlighting the heterogeneity of mutations in the SERPING1 gene. Furthermore, it appears that mutations with a clear effect on C1-INH function might be responsible for a more severe disease phenotype."

We assessed the impact of actual VMMC scale-up to date and evaluated the impact of potential alterations to the program to enhance program efficiency, through prioritization of subpopulations.We implemented a recently developed analytical approach: the age-structured mathematical (ASM) model and accompanying three-level conceptual framework to assess the impact of VMMC as an intervention. By September 2014, 364,185 males were circumcised, an initiative that is estimated to avert 40,301 HIV infections by 2025. Through age-group prioritization, the number of VMMCs needed to avert one infection (effectiveness) ranged between ten (20-24 age-group) and 53 (45-49 age-group). The cost per infection averted ranged between $811 (20-24 age-group) and $5,518 (45-49 age-group). By 2025, the largest reductions in HIV incidence rate (up to 27%) were achieved by prioritizing 10-14, 15-19, or 20-24 year old. The greatest program efficiency was achieved by prioritizing 15-24, 15-29, or 15-34 year old. Prioritizing males 13-29 year old was programmatically efficient, but slightly inferior to the 15-24, 15-29, or 15-34 age groups. Through geographic prioritization, effectiveness varied from 9-12 VMMCs per infection averted across provinces. Through risk-group prioritization, effectiveness ranged from one (highest sexual risk-group) to 60 (lowest sexual risk-group) VMMCs per infection averted.The current VMMC program plan in Zimbabwe is targeting an efficient and impactful age bracket (13-29 year old), but program efficiency can be improved by prioritizing a subset of males for demand creation and service availability. The greatest program efficiency can be attained by prioritizing young sexually active males and males whose sexual behavior puts them at higher risk for acquiring HIV."

https://openalex.org/W1899828395,"Multiple Listeria monocytogenes strains can be present in the same food sample; moreover, infection with more than one L. monocytogenes strain can also occur. In this study we investigated the impact of strain competition on the growth and in vitro virulence potential of L. monocytogenes. We identified two strong competitor strains, whose growth was not (or only slightly) influenced by the presence of other strains and two weak competitor strains, which were outcompeted by other strains. Cell contact was essential for growth inhibition. In vitro virulence assays using human intestinal epithelial Caco2 cells showed a correlation between the invasion efficiency and growth inhibition: the strong growth competitor strains showed high invasiveness. Moreover, invasion efficiency of the highly invasive strain was further increased in certain combinations by the presence of a low invasive strain. In all tested combinations, the less invasive strain was outcompeted by the higher invasive strain. Studying the effect of cell contact on in vitro virulence competition revealed a complex pattern in which the observed effects depended only partially on cell-contact suggesting that competition occurs at two different levels: i) during co-cultivation prior to infection, which might influence the expression of virulence factors, and ii) during infection, when bacterial cells compete for the host cell. In conclusion, we show that growth of L. monocytogenes can be inhibited by strains of the same species leading potentially to biased recovery during enrichment procedures. Furthermore, the presence of more than one L. monocytogenes strain in food can lead to increased infection rates due to synergistic effects on the virulence potential."
https://openalex.org/W1897144326,"The suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) is critical to the maintenance of immune homeostasis in vivo and yet, the specific identification of Tregs by phenotypic markers is not perfect. Tregs were originally identified in the CD4+CD25+ fraction of T cells, but FoxP3 expression was later included as an additional marker of Tregs as FoxP3 expression was identified as being critical to the development and function of these cells. Intracellular expression of FoxP3 makes it difficult in using to isolate live and not permeabilized cells for functional assays. As such CD4+CD25+ fraction is still frequently used for functional assays of Tregs. Although, the CD4+CD25+ fraction substantially overlaps with the FoxP3+ fraction, the minor mismatch between CD4+CD25+ and FoxP3+ fractions may confound the functional characteristics of Tregs. In this study, we isolated CD4+FoxP3+ as well as CD4+CD25+ fractions from Foxp3 knock-in mice, and compared their proliferative and suppressive activity in the presence or absence of various concentrations of IL-2. Our results showed comparable patterns of proliferative and suppressive responses for both fractions, except that contrary to the CD4+CD25+ fraction the FoxP3+ fraction did not proliferate in an autocrine fashion even in response to a strong stimulation. In presence of exogenous IL-2, both CD4+CD25+ and CD4+FoxP3+ fractions were more sensitive than the CD4+CD25- responder cells in proliferative responsiveness. In addition, a low dose IL-2 enhanced whereas a high dose abrogated the suppressive activities of the CD4+CD25+ and CD4+FoxP3+ fractions. These results may provide an additional understanding of the characteristics of the various fractions of isolated Tregs based on phenotype and function and the role of varying levels of exogenous IL-2 on the suppressive activity of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2139974874,"Damage to the brain’s white matter is a signature injury of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), yet understanding of risks associated with clinical and demographic characteristics is incomplete. This study investigated alcohol problem severity, recent drinking behavior, and demographic factors in relation to white matter microstructure in heavy drinkers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), were collected from 324 participants (mean age = 30.9 ± 9.1 years; 30% female) who reported five or more heavy drinking episodes in the past 30 days. Drinking history and alcohol problem severity were assessed. A common white matter factor was created from fractional anisotropy (FA) values of five white matter tracts: body of corpus callosum, fornix, external capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulate gyrus. Previous research has implicated these tracts in heavy drinking. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses tested the hypothesis that, after controlling for duration of alcohol exposure, clinical and behavioral measures of alcohol use severity would be associated with lower white matter factor scores. Potential interactions with smoking status, gender, age, treatment-seeking status, and depression or anxiety symptoms also were tested. Controlling for number of years drinking, greater alcohol problem severity and recent drinking frequency were significantly associated with lower white matter factor scores. The effect of drinking frequency differed significantly for men and women, such that higher drinking frequency was linked to lower white matter factor scores in women but not in men. In conclusion, alcohol problem severity was a significant predictor of lower white matter FA in heavy drinkers, after controlling for duration of alcohol exposure. In addition, more frequent drinking contributed to lower FA in women but not men, suggesting gender-specific vulnerability to alcohol neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2185082853,"The major feature of the human pancreatic islet architecture is the organization of endocrine cells into clusters comprising central β cells and peripheral α cells surrounded by vasculature. To have an insight into the mechanisms that govern this unique islet architecture, islet cells were isolated, and reaggregation of α and β cells into islet-like structures (pseudoislets) after culture or transplantation into mice was studied by immunohistology. The pseudoislets formed in culture displayed an unusual cell arrangement, contrasting with the transplanted pseudoislets, which exhibited a cell arrangement similar to that observed in native pancreatic islet subunits. The pattern of revascularization and the distribution of extracellular matrix around transplanted pseudoislets were alike to those observed in native pancreatic islets. This organization of transplanted pseudoislets occurred also when revascularization was abolished by treating mice with an anti-VEGF antibody, but not when contact with extracellular matrix was prevented by encapsulation of pseudoislets within alginate hydrogel. These results indicate that the maintenance of islet cell arrangement is dependent on in vivo features such as extracellular matrix but independent of vascularization."
https://openalex.org/W2248337525,"Little is known about the association between cardiovascular (CV) health and health insurance status. We hypothesized that U.S. adults without health insurance coverage would have a lower likelihood of ideal cardiovascular health.Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2007-2010, we examined the relationship between health insurance status and ideal CV health in U.S. adults aged ≥19 years and <65 (N = 3304). Ideal CV health was defined by the American Heart Association (AHA) as the absence of clinically manifested CV disease and the simultaneous presence of 6-7 ""ideal"" CV health factors and behaviors. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the relationship between health insurance status and the odds of ideal CV health. Of the U.S. adult population, 5.4% attained ideal CV health, and 23.5% were without health insurance coverage. Those without health insurance coverage were more likely to be young (p<0.0001), male (p<0.0001), non-white (p<0.0001), with less than a high school degree (p<0.0001), have a poverty-to-income ratio less than 1 (p<0.0001) and unemployed (p<0.0001) compared to those with coverage. Lack of health insurance coverage was associated with a lower likelihood of ideal CV health; however, this relationship was attenuated by socioeconomic status.U.S. adults without health insurance coverage are less likely to have ideal CV health. Population-based strategies and interventions directed at the community-level may be one way to improve overall CV health and reach this at-risk group."
https://openalex.org/W2269359587,"Motor unit activity is coordinated between many synergistic muscle pairs but the functional role of this coordination for the motor output is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the short-term modality of coordinated motor unit activity-the synchronized discharge of individual motor units across muscles within time intervals of 5ms-for the Vastus Medialis (VM) and Lateralis (VL). Furthermore, we studied the task-dependency of intermuscular motor unit synchronization between VM and VL during static and dynamic squatting tasks to provide insight into its functional role.Sixteen healthy male and female participants completed four tasks: Bipedal squats, single-leg squats, an isometric squat, and single-leg balance. Monopolar surface electromyography (EMG) was used to record motor unit activity of VM and VL. For each task, intermuscular motor unit synchronization was determined using a coherence analysis between the raw EMG signals of VM and VL and compared to a reference coherence calculated from two desynchronized EMG signals. The time shift between VM and VL EMG signals was estimated according to the slope of the coherence phase angle spectrum.For all tasks, except for singe-leg balance, coherence between 15-80Hz significantly exceeded the reference. The corresponding time shift between VM and VL was estimated as 4ms. Coherence between 30-60Hz was highest for the bipedal squat, followed by the single-leg squat and the isometric squat.There is substantial short-term motor unit synchronization between VM and VL. Intermuscular motor unit synchronization is enhanced for contractions during dynamic activities, possibly to facilitate a more accurate control of the joint torque, and reduced during single-leg tasks that require balance control and thus, a more independent muscle function. It is proposed that the central nervous system scales the degree of intermuscular motor unit synchronization according to the requirements of the movement task at hand."
https://openalex.org/W2134198519,"Physical fitness has salutary psychological and physical effects in older adults by promoting neuroplasticity and adaptation to stress. In aging, however, the effects of fitness on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are mixed. We investigated the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and HPA activity in healthy elderly men (n = 22, mean age 68 y; smokers, obese subjects, those taking drugs or reporting recent stressful events were excluded), by measuring in saliva: i) daily pattern of cortisol secretion (6 samples: 30’ post-awakening, and at 12.00, 15.00, 18.00, 21.00, 24.00 h); and ii) the cortisol response to a mental challenge. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) was estimated using the Rockport Walking Test and the participants were assigned to high-fit (HF, ≥60°, n = 10) and low-fit (LF, ≤35°, n = 12) groups according to age-specific percentiles of VO2max distribution in the general population. At all daytimes, basal cortisol levels were lower in the HF than the LF group, most notably in the evening and midnight samples, with a significant main effect of physical fitness for cortisol levels overall; the area-under-the-curve for total daily cortisol output was significantly smaller in the HF group. Among the subjects who responded to mental stress (baseline-to-peak increment >1.5 nmol/L; n = 13, 5 LF, 8 HF), the amplitude of cortisol response and the steepness of recovery decline displayed an increasing trend in the HF subjects, although between-group differences failed to reach the threshold for significance. In conclusion, cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy aging men is negatively correlated with daily cortisol output and contributes to buffering the HPA dysregulation that occurs with advancing age, thus possibly playing a beneficial role in contrasting age-related cognitive and physical decline."

Aberrant splicing of TAU exon 10 results in tauopathies characterized by alterations in the proportion of TAU isoforms containing three (3R) or four (4R) microtubule-binding repeats. The splicing factor SC35/SRSF2 binds to nuclear RNA and facilitates the incorporation of exon 10 in the TAU molecule. Here, we utilized clinical samples, an animal model, and neuronal cell cultures and found that Tat promotes TAU 3R up-regulation through increased levels of phosphorylated SC35, which is retained in nuclear speckles. This mechanism involved Tat-mediated increased expression of DYRK1A and was prevented by DYRK1A silencing. In addition, we found that Tat associates with TAU RNA, further demonstrating that Tat interferes with host RNA metabolism in the absence of viral infection. Altogether, our data unravel a novel mechanism of Tat-mediated neuronal toxicity through dysregulation of the SC35-dependent alternative splicing of TAU exon 10. Furthermore, the increased immunostaining of DYRK1A in HIV+ brains without pathology points at dysregulation of DYRK1A as an early event in the neuronal complications of HIV infection.

https://openalex.org/W1929124694,"Balancing society’s competing needs of development and conservation requires careful consideration of tradeoffs. Renewable energy development and biodiversity conservation are often considered beneficial environmental goals. The direct footprint and disturbance of renewable energy, however, can displace species’ habitat and negatively impact populations and natural communities if sited without ecological consideration. Offsets have emerged as a potentially useful tool to mitigate residual impacts after trying to avoid, minimize, or restore affected sites. Yet the problem of efficiently designing a set of offset sites becomes increasingly complex where many species or many sites are involved. Spatial conservation prioritization tools are designed to handle this problem, but have seen little application to offset siting and analysis. To address this need we designed an offset siting support tool for the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) of California, and present a case study of hypothetical impacts from solar development in the Western Mojave subsection. We compare two offset scenarios designed to mitigate a hypothetical 15,331 ha derived from proposed utility-scale solar energy development (USSED) projects. The first scenario prioritizes offsets based precisely on impacted features, while the second scenario offsets impacts to maximize biodiversity conservation gains in the region. The two methods only agree on 28% of their prioritized sites and differ in meeting species-specific offset goals. Differences between the two scenarios highlight the importance of clearly specifying choices and priorities for offset siting and mitigation in general. Similarly, the effects of background climate and land use change may lessen the durability or effectiveness of offsets if not considered. Our offset siting support tool was designed specifically for the DRECP area, but with minor code modification could work well in other offset analyses, and could provide continuing support for a potentially innovative mitigation solution to environmental impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2146309387,"Temporal-spatial, kinematic variability, and dynamic stability measures collected during perturbation-based assessment paradigms are often used to identify dysfunction associated with gait instability. However, it remains unclear which measures are most reliable for detecting and tracking responses to perturbations. This study systematically determined the between-session reliability and minimum detectable change values of temporal-spatial, kinematic variability, and dynamic stability measures during three types of perturbed gait. Twenty young healthy adults completed two identical testing sessions two weeks apart, comprised of an unperturbed and three perturbed (cognitive, physical, and visual) walking conditions in a virtual reality environment. Within each session, perturbation responses were compared to unperturbed walking using paired t-tests. Between-session reliability and minimum detectable change values were also calculated for each measure and condition. All temporal-spatial, kinematic variability and dynamic stability measures demonstrated fair to excellent between-session reliability. Minimal detectable change values, normalized to mean values ranged from 1–50%. Step width mean and variability measures demonstrated the greatest response to perturbations with excellent between-session reliability and low minimum detectable change values. Orbital stability measures demonstrated specificity to perturbation direction and sensitivity with excellent between-session reliability and low minimum detectable change values. We observed substantially greater between-session reliability and lower minimum detectable change values for local stability measures than previously described which may be the result of averaging across trials within a session and using velocity versus acceleration data for reconstruction of state spaces. Across all perturbation types, temporal-spatial, orbital and local measures were the most reliable measures with the lowest minimum detectable change values, supporting their use for tracking changes over multiple testing sessions. The between-session reliability and minimum detectable change values reported here provide an objective means for interpreting changes in temporal-spatial, kinematic variability, and dynamic stability measures during perturbed walking which may assist in identifying instability."
https://openalex.org/W2176286506,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women and mammography screening programs are seen as a key strategy to reduce breast cancer mortality. In Germany, women are invited to the population-based mammography screening program between ages 50 to 69. It is still discussed whether the benefits of mammography screening outweigh its harms. Therefore, the concept of informed choice comprising knowledge, attitude and intention has gained importance. The objective of this observational study was to assess the proportion of informed choices among women invited to the German mammography screening program for the first time. A representative sample of 17,349 women aged 50 years from a sub-region of North Rhine Westphalia was invited to participate in a postal survey. Turkish immigrant women were oversampled. The effects of education level and migration status on informed choice and its components were assessed. 5,847 (33.7%) women responded to the postal questionnaire of which 4,113 were used for analyses. 31.5% of the women had sufficient knowledge. The proportion of sufficient knowledge was lower among immigrants and among women with low education levels. The proportion of women making informed choices was low (27.1%), with similar associations with education level and migration status. Women of low (OR 2.75; 95% CI 2.18–3.46) and medium education level (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.27–1.75) were more likely to make an uninformed choice than women of high education level. Turkish immigrant women had the greatest odds for making an uninformed choice (OR 5.30, 95% CI 1.92–14.66) compared to non-immigrant women. Other immigrant women only had slightly greater odds for making an uninformed choice than non-immigrant women. As immigrant populations and women with low education level have been shown to have poor knowledge, they need special attention in measures to increase knowledge and thus informed choices."

The present study focused on the role of inositol polyphosphate-4-phosphatase type I (Inpp4a) in phagocytosis. Raw264.7 cells that express shRNA against Inpp4a (shInpp4a cells) showed significantly increased phagocytic activity. The introduction of shRNA-resistant human Inpp4a abolished this increase. Macrophages from Inpp4a knockout mice showed similar increases in the phagocytic activity. Inpp4a was recruited to the phagosome membrane by a mechanism other than the direct interaction with Rab5. PtdIns(3,4)P2 increased on the phagosome of shInpp4a cells, while PtdIns(3)P significantly decreased. The results indicate that Inpp4a negatively regulates the phagocytic activity of macrophages as a member of the sequential dephosphorylation system that metabolizes phagosomal PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(3)P."
https://openalex.org/W2134210416,"Young children spontaneously share resources with anonymous recipients, but little is known about the specific circumstances that promote or hinder these prosocial tendencies. Children (ages 3–11) received a small (12) or large (30) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients (Dictator Game). Whether a child chose to share or not varied as a function of age, but was uninfluenced by numerical context. Moreover, children’s giving was consistent with a proportion-based account, such that children typically donated a similar proportion (but different absolute number) of the resources given to them, regardless of whether they originally received a small or large windfall. The proportion of resources donated, however, did vary based on the number of recipients with whom they were allowed to share, such that on average, children shared more when there were more recipients available, particularly when they had more resources, suggesting they take others into consideration when making prosocial decisions. Finally, results indicated that a child’s gender also predicted sharing behavior, with males generally sharing more resources than females. Together, findings suggest that the numerical contexts under which children are asked to share, as well as the quantity of resources that they have to share, may interact to promote (or hinder) altruistic behaviors throughout childhood."
https://openalex.org/W2222248410,"Tumorigenic potential of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) infiltrating population of induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) generated from iPSCs may limit their medical applications. To overcome such a difficulty, direct reprogramming of adult somatic cells into iNSCs was proposed. The aim of this study was the systematic comparison of induced neural cells (iNc) obtained with different methods—direct reprogramming of human adult fibroblasts with either SOX2 (SiNSc-like) or SOX2 and c-MYC (SMiNSc-like) and induced pluripotent stem cells differentiation to ebiNSc—in terms of gene expression profile, differentiation potential as well as proliferation properties. Immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analyses were used to evaluate gene expression profile and differentiation potential of various iNc types. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assays were used to estimate proliferation potential. All three types of iNc were capable of neuronal differentiation; however, astrocytic differentiation was possible only in case of ebiNSc. Contrary to ebiNSc generation, the direct reprogramming was rarely a propitious process, despite 100% transduction efficiency. The potency of direct iNSCs-like cells generation was lower as compared to iNSCs obtained by iPSCs differentiation, and only slightly improved when c-MYC was added. Directly reprogrammed iNSCs-like cells were lacking the ability to differentiate into astrocytic cells and characterized by poor efficiency of neuronal cells formation. Such features indicated that these cells could not be fully reprogrammed, as confirmed mainly with senescence detection. Importantly, SiNSc-like and SMiNSc-like cells were unable to achieve the long-term survival and became senescent, which limits their possible therapeutic applicability. Our results suggest that iNSCs-like cells, generated in the direct reprogramming attempts, were either not fully reprogrammed or reprogrammed only into neuronal progenitors, mainly because of the inaccuracies of currently available protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2272266700,"Bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) is arguably the most important viral disease of cattle. It is associated with reproductive, respiratory and chronic diseases in cattle across the world. In this study we have investigated the capacity of the major immunological determinant of BVDV-1, the E2 protein combined with hollow type mesoporous silica nanoparticles with surface amino functionalisation (HMSA), to stimulate immune responses in sheep. The current work also investigated the immunogenicity of the E2 nanoformulation before and after freeze-drying processes. The optimal excipient formulation for freeze-drying of the E2 nanoformulation was determined to be 5% trehalose and 1% glycine. This excipient formulation preserved both the E2 protein integrity and HMSA particle structure. Sheep were immunised three times at three week intervals by subcutaneous injection with 500 μg E2 adsorbed to 6.2 mg HMSA as either a non-freeze-dried or freeze-dried nanoformulation. The capacity of both nanovaccine formulations to generate humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated responses in sheep were compared to the responses in sheep immunisation with Opti-E2 (500 μg) together with the conventional adjuvant Quil-A (1 mg), a saponin from the Molina tree (Quillaja saponira). The level of the antibody responses detected to both the non-freeze-dried and freeze-dried Opti-E2/HMSA nanoformulations were similar to those obtained for Opti-E2 plus Quil-A, demonstrating the E2 nanoformulations were immunogenic in a large animal, and freeze-drying did not affect the immunogenicity of the E2 antigen. Importantly, it was demonstrated that the long term cell-mediated immune responses were detectable up to four months after immunisation. The cell-mediated immune responses were consistently high in all sheep immunised with the freeze-dried Opti-E2/HMSA nanovaccine formulation (>2,290 SFU/million cells) compared to the non-freeze-dried nanovaccine formulation (213-500 SFU/million cells). This study is the first to demonstrate that a freeze-dried silica mesoporous nanovaccine formulation gives balanced immune responses in a production animal."

Obesity in pregnancy is related to greater levels of anxiety, depression and physical harm. However, pregnancy is an opportune moment for the intervention of health care professionals to address obesity. The objective of this study was to describe how obese pregnant women emotionally experience success in adequate weight control. Methods and Findings Using a qualitative design that seeks to understand content in the field of health, the sample of subjects was deliberated, with thirteen obese pregnant women selected to participate in an individual interview. Data was analysed by inductive content analysis and includes complete transcription of the interviews, re-readings using suspended attention, categorization in discussion topics and the qualitative and inductive analysis of the content. The analysis revealed four categories, three of which show the trajectory of body care that obese women experience during pregnancy: 1) The obese pregnant woman starts to think about her body;2) The challenge of the diet for the obese pregnant woman; 3) The relation of the obese pregnant woman with the team of antenatal professionals. The fourth category reveals the origin of the motivation for the change: 4) The potentializing factors for change: the motivation of the obese woman while pregnant. Conclusions During pregnancy, obese women are more in touch with themselves and with their emotional conflicts. Through the transformations of their bodies, women can start a more refined self-care process and experience of the body-mind unit. The fear for their own and their baby's life, due to the risks posed by obesity, appears to be a great potentializing factor for change. The relationship with the professionals of the health care team plays an important role in the motivational support of the obese pregnant woman."
https://openalex.org/W2263105000,"This paper reports the first find of pika remains in the Iberian Peninsula, at a site in central Spain. A fragmented mandible of Ochotona cf. pusilla was unearthed from Layer 3 (deposited some 63.4±5.5 ka ago as determined by thermoluminescence) of the Buena Pinta Cave. This record establishes new limits for the genus geographic distribution during the Pleistocene, shifting the previous edge of its known range southwest by some 500 km. It also supports the idea that, even though Europe's alpine mountain ranges represented a barrier that prevented the dispersal into the south to this and other taxa of small mammals from central and eastern Europe, they were crossed or circumvented at the coldest time intervals of the end of the Middle Pleistocene and of the Late Pleistocene. During those periods both the reduction of the forest cover and the emersion of large areas of the continental shelf due to the drop of the sea level probably provided these species a way to surpass this barrier. The pika mandible was found accompanying the remains of other small mammals adapted to cold climates, indicating the presence of steppe environments in central Iberia during the Late Pleistocene."

Among the components of the chloroform extract, (E)-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)but-3-en-1-ol (DMPB) increased melanogenesis in both B16F10 cells and human primary melanocytes. In B16F10 cells, DMPB enhanced the activation of ERK and p38, and the level of tyrosinase. Although the level of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor was unchanged in DMPB-treated B16F10 cells, DMPB increased levels and nuclear localization of upstream stimulating factor-1 (USF1). Consistently, DMPB-mediated melanin synthesis was diminished in USF1-knockdown cells. Furthermore, DMPB induced hyperpigmentation in brown guinea pigs in vivo. Together, these data suggest that DMPB may promote melanin synthesis via USF1 dependent fashion and could be used as a clinical therapeutic agent against hypopigmentation-associated diseases."

However, little is known about how this information is integrated with action understanding. Here, we present the ontogenetic and evolutionary foundations of this capacity by comparing face-scanning patterns of chimpanzees and humans as they viewed goal-directed human actions within contexts that differ in whether or not the predicted goal is achieved. Human adults and children attend to the actor's face during action sequences, and this tendency is particularly pronounced in adults when observing that the predicted goal is not achieved. Chimpanzees rarely attend to the actor's face during the goal-directed action, regardless of whether the predicted action goal is achieved or not. These results suggest that in humans, but not chimpanzees, attention to actor's faces conveying referential information toward the target object indicates the process of observers making inferences about the intentionality of an action. Furthermore, this remarkable predisposition to observe others' actions by integrating the prediction of action goals and the actor's intention is developmentally acquired."

Here, we report on proton-induced X-ray emission analyses of 118 proto-porcelain and 35 impressed stoneware sherds from Piaoshan and five subsequent kiln sites in the vicinity. Using principal components analysis on the major chemical compositions, we reveal the relationships between impressed stoneware and proto-porcelain samples from the six kiln sites. The sherds from different sites have distinctive chemical profiles. The results indicate that the raw materials were procured locally. We find a developmental tendency for early glazes towards mature calcium-based glaze. It is most likely that woody plant ashes with increased calcia-potash ratios were applied to the formula."
https://openalex.org/W2137533118,"Background The FloTrac/Vigileo™ system does not thoroughly reflect variable arterial tones, due to a lack of external calibration. The ability of this system to measure stroke volume and track its changes after fluid administration has not been fully evaluated in patients with the high systemic vascular resistance that can develop during laparoscopic surgery. Methods In 42 patients undergoing laparoscopic prostatectomy, the stroke volume derived by the third-generation FloTrac/Vigileo™ system (SV-Vigileo), the stroke volume measured using transesophageal echocardiography (SV-TEE) as a reference method, and total systemic vascular resistance were evaluated before and after 500 ml fluid administration during pneumoperitoneum combined with the Trendelenburg position. Results Total systemic vascular resistance was 2159.4 ± 523.5 dyn·s/cm5 before fluid administration. The SV-Vigileo was significantly higher than the SV-TEE both before (68.8 ± 15.9 vs. 57.0 ± 11.0 ml, P < 0.001) and after (73.0 ± 14.8 vs. 64.9 ± 12.2 ml, P = 0.003) fluid administration. During pneumoperitoneum combined with the Trendelenburg position, Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measures showed a 53.8% of percentage error between the SV-Vigileo and the SV-TEE. Four-quadrant plot (69.2% of a concordance rate) and polar plot analysis (20.6° of a mean polar angle, 16.4° of the SD of a polar angle, and ±51.5° of a radial sector containing 95% of the data points) did not indicate a good trending ability of the FloTrac/Vigileo™ system. Conclusions The third-generation FloTrac/Vigileo™ system may not be useful in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, based on unreliable performance in measuring the stroke volume and in tracking changes in the stroke volume after fluid administration during pneumoperitoneum combined with the Trendelenburg position."

The frequencies of genotypes at -24, 1249 of ABCC2, and 2677 of ABCB1 were neither different between patients with decrement in eGFR of >10ml/min/1.73m2 and those without such decrement (ABCC2: -24, p = 0.53, 1249, p = 0.68; ABCB1: 2677, p = 0.74), nor between those without and with the other two renal outcomes (>25% decrement: ABCC2: -24, p = 0.83, 1249, p = 0.97, ABCB1: 2677, p = 0.40; eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m2: ABCC2: -24, p = 0.51, 1249, p = 0.81, ABCB1: 2677, p = 0.94). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk genotype of the three SNPs were not associated with any of the three renal outcomes, respectively. Logistic regression model that applied either dominant, recessive, or additive model yielded the same results.SNPs of the drug transporters for TDF are not associated with clinically important renal outcomes in patients who initiated TDF-containing ART."
https://openalex.org/W2144035549,"Major climatic changes in the Pleistocene had significant effects on marine organisms and the environments in which they lived. The presence of divergent patterns of demographic history even among phylogenetically closely-related species sharing climatic changes raises questions as to the respective influence of species-specific traits on population structure. In this work we tested whether the lifestyle of Antarctic notothenioid benthic and pelagic fish species from the Southern Ocean influenced the concerted population response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. This was done by a comparative analysis of sequence variation at the cyt b and S7 loci in nine newly sequenced and four re-analysed species. We found that all species underwent more or less intensive changes in population size but we also found consistent differences between demographic histories of pelagic and benthic species. Contemporary pelagic populations are significantly more genetically diverse and bear traces of older demographic expansions than less diverse benthic species that show evidence of more recent population expansions. Our findings suggest that the lifestyles of different species have strong influences on their responses to the same environmental events. Our data, in conjunction with previous studies showing a constant diversification tempo of these species during the Pleistocene, support the hypothesis that Pleistocene glaciations had a smaller effect on pelagic species than on benthic species whose survival may have relied upon ephemeral refugia in shallow shelf waters. These findings suggest that the interaction between lifestyle and environmental changes should be considered in genetic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2170546661,"This study aimed to investigate the association between herpes zoster (HZ) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Data were retrieved from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Databases (LHID 2005 and 2010), Taiwan. The International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes were used to identify Hz from 2001–2004. Identification of HIV infection was from 2005–2010. The hazard ratios of HIV among herpes zoster infected and non-herpes zoster infected patients were estimated using multiple Cox proportional hazard model. In general, 19685 participants were identified with Hz. The HIV incidence rates (per 104 person-months) in herpes zoster infected and non-infected patients were 0.191(95% CI 0.130–0.280) and 0.079 (95% CI 0.074–0.084), respectively while the hazard ratio (HR) of HIV among infected individuals was 3.518 (95% CI 2.375–5.211). This study concludes that herpes zoster could be considered as a predictor of HIV infection especially among Asian populations, hence it is vital to test herpes zoster infected individuals for HIV antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1925686016,"Population sizing from still aerial pictures is of wide applicability in ecological and social sciences. The problem is long standing because current automatic detection and counting algorithms are known to fail in most cases, and exhaustive manual counting is tedious, slow, difficult to verify and unfeasible for large populations. An alternative is to multiply population density with some reference area but, unfortunately, sampling details, handling of edge effects, etc., are seldom described. For the first time we address the problem using principles of geometric sampling. These principles are old and solid, but largely unknown outside the areas of three dimensional microscopy and stereology. Here we adapt them to estimate the size of any population of individuals lying on an essentially planar area, e.g. people, animals, trees on a savanna, etc. The proposed design is unbiased irrespective of population size, pattern, perspective artifacts, etc. The implementation is very simple-it is based on the random superimposition of coarse quadrat grids. Also, an objective error assessment is often lacking. For the latter purpose the quadrat counts are often assumed to be independent. We demonstrate that this approach can perform very poorly, and we propose (and check via Monte Carlo resampling) a new theoretical error prediction formula. As far as efficiency, counting about 50 (100) individuals in 20 quadrats, can yield relative standard errors of about 8% (5%) in typical cases. This fact effectively breaks the barrier hitherto imposed by the current lack of automatic face detection algorithms, because semiautomatic sampling and manual counting becomes an attractive option."
https://openalex.org/W2252476398,"A world-wide internet survey was conducted to test central assumptions of a recent theory of cultural transmission in minorities proposed by the authors. 844 1st to 2nd generation immigrants from a wide variety of countries recruited on a microjob platform completed a questionnaire designed to test eight hypotheses derived from the theory. Support was obtained for all hypotheses. In particular, evidence was obtained for the continued presence, in the immigrants, of the culture-transmission motive postulated by the theory: the desire to maintain the culture of origin and transmit it to the next generation. Support was also obtained for the hypothesized anchoring of the culture-transmission motive in more basic motives fulfilled by cultural groups, the relative intra- and intergenerational stability of the culture-transmission motive, and its motivating effects for action tendencies and desires that support cultural transmission under the difficult conditions of migration. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the assumption that people have a culture-transmission motive belongs to the folk psychology of sociocultural groups, and that immigrants regard the fulfillment of this desire as a moral right."
https://openalex.org/W2271936122,"Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that alter the synthesis of cholesterol. Some studies have shown a significant association of statins with improved respiratory health outcomes of patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Here we hypothesize that statins impact gene expression in human lungs and may reveal the pleiotropic effects of statins that are taking place directly in lung tissues. Human lung tissues were obtained from patients who underwent lung resection or transplantation. Gene expression was measured on a custom Affymetrix array in a discovery cohort (n = 408) and two replication sets (n = 341 and 282). Gene expression was evaluated by linear regression between statin users and non-users, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and other covariables. The results of each cohort were combined in a meta-analysis and biological pathways were studied using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The discovery set included 141 statin users. The lung mRNA expression levels of eighteen and three genes were up-regulated and down-regulated in statin users (FDR < 0.05), respectively. Twelve of the up-regulated genes were replicated in the first replication set, but none in the second (p-value < 0.05). Combining the discovery and replication sets into a meta-analysis improved the significance of the 12 up-regulated genes, which includes genes encoding enzymes and membrane proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Canonical biological pathways altered by statins in the lung include cholesterol, steroid, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. No genes encoding inflammatory, proteases, pro-fibrotic or growth factors were altered by statins, suggesting that the direct effect of statin in the lung do not go beyond its antilipidemic action. Although more studies are needed with specific lung cell types and different classes and doses of statins, the improved health outcomes and survival observed in statin users with chronic lung diseases do not seem to be mediated through direct regulation of gene expression in the lung."
https://openalex.org/W1936892702,"Heat capacity (HC) has an important role in the temperature regulation process, particularly in dealing with the heat load. The actual measurement of the body HC is complicated and is generally estimated by body-composition-specific data. This study compared the previously known HC estimating equations and sought how to define HC using simple anthropometric indices such as weight and body surface area (BSA) in the Korean population. Six hundred participants were randomly selected from a pool of 902 healthy volunteers aged 20 to 70 years for the training set. The remaining 302 participants were used for the test set. Body composition analysis using multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to access body components including body fat, water, protein, and mineral mass. Four different HCs were calculated and compared using a weight-based HC (HC_Eq1), two HCs estimated from fat and fat-free mass (HC_Eq2 and HC_Eq3), and an HC calculated from fat, protein, water, and mineral mass (HC_Eq4). HC_Eq1 generally produced a larger HC than the other HC equations and had a poorer correlation with the other HC equations. HC equations using body composition data were well-correlated to each other. If HC estimated with HC_Eq4 was regarded as a standard, interestingly, the BSA and weight independently contributed to the variation of HC. The model composed of weight, BSA, and gender was able to predict more than a 99% variation of HC_Eq4. Validation analysis on the test set showed a very high satisfactory level of the predictive model. In conclusion, our results suggest that gender, BSA, and weight are the independent factors for calculating HC. For the first time, a predictive equation based on anthropometry data was developed and this equation could be useful for estimating HC in the general Korean population without body-composition measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2219197936,"Biomolecular recognition underlying drug-target interactions is determined by both binding affinity and specificity. Whilst, quantification of binding efficacy is possible, determining specificity remains a challenge, as it requires affinity data for multiple targets with the same ligand dataset. Thus, understanding the interaction space by mapping the target space to model its complementary chemical space through computational techniques are desirable. In this study, active site architecture of FabD drug target in two apicomplexan parasites viz. Plasmodium falciparum (PfFabD) and Toxoplasma gondii (TgFabD) is explored, followed by consensus docking calculations and identification of fifteen best hit compounds, most of which are found to be derivatives of natural products. Subsequently, machine learning techniques were applied on molecular descriptors of six FabD homologs and sixty ligands to induce distinct multivariate partial-least square models. The biological space of FabD mapped by the various chemical entities explain their interaction space in general. It also highlights the selective variations in FabD of apicomplexan parasites with that of the host. Furthermore, chemometric models revealed the principal chemical scaffolds in PfFabD and TgFabD as pyrrolidines and imidazoles, respectively, which render target specificity and improve binding affinity in combination with other functional descriptors conducive for the design and optimization of the leads."
https://openalex.org/W2228042522,"Trypanosoma brucei is a vector-borne parasite with intricate life cycle that can cause serious diseases in humans and animals. This pathogen relies on fine regulation of gene expression to respond and adapt to variable environments, with implications in transmission and infectivity. However, the involved regulatory elements and their mechanisms of actions are largely unknown. Here, benefiting from a new graph-based approach for finding functional regulatory elements in RNA (GRAFFER), we have predicted 88 new RNA regulatory elements that are potentially involved in the gene regulatory network of T. brucei. We show that many of these newly predicted elements are responsive to both transcriptomic and proteomic changes during the life cycle of the parasite. Moreover, we found that 11 of predicted elements strikingly resemble previously identified regulatory elements for the parasite. Additionally, comparison with previously predicted motifs on T. brucei suggested the superior performance of our approach based on the current limited knowledge of regulatory elements in T. brucei."
