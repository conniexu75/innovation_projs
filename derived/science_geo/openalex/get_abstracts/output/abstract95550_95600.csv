https://openalex.org/W1978268702,"The visual cortical areas in the two hemispheres are interconnected by axons running through the corpus callosum. In adult cats, these axons originate from, and terminate in, tangentially restricted portions of each area. In young kittens, however, callosal axons originate from the entire extent of each area, although they apparently enter the gray matter only in the restricted regions where they will also be found in adults. In kittens, but not in adults, callosal axons also reach other regions, but there they appear to be confined to the lowest part of layer VI. During the first two postnatal months, the callosal efferent zones become progressively restricted to their adult locations. During this process, many neurons eliminate the axons (or axon collaterals) that they had formerly sent through the corpus callosum and form permanent connection ipsilaterally."

In three of these women the time of oocyte maturation was controlled by human chorionic gonadotropin. This procedure for the control of ovulatory response has many advantages when compared with the previously successful method of using the natural ovulatory cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2002833331,"Research on chitin as a marine resource is pointing to novel applications for this cellulose-like biopolymer. Discovery of nondegrading solvent systems has permitted the spinning of filaments, for example, for use as surgical sutures. New methods for preparing the bioactive alkyl glycoside of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (the monomer unit of chitin) and a microcrystalline chitin has encouraged their use as promoters for growth of bifidobacteria and as an aid in digestion of high-lactose cheese whey by domestic animals. Chitin-protein complexes of several crustacean species show great variability in ratios of chitin to covalently bound protein and in residual protein in the ""purified"" chitins."

Orientation preference is maintained for at least 2 months and predicts preferential hand use in reaching tasks at both 16 and 22 weeks. Right head-orientation preference in early infancy may contribute to the early development of right-handedness."

https://openalex.org/W2091979492,A sexual dimorphism in the functional asymmetry of the damaged human brain is reflected in a test-specific laterality effect in male but not in female patients. This sex difference explains some contradictions concerning the effects of unilateral brain damage on intelligence in studies in which the influence of sex was overlooked.

https://openalex.org/W1991218132,"A tritium-labeled probe that detects measles virus nucleotide sequences was hybridized in situ to cells infected with measles virus and to sections of brain tissue from patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and from patients with multiple sclerosis. The measles virus genome was detected in many cells in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis where this virus would have been missed by methods such as immunofluorescence. Measles virus sequences were also found in two foci in one of four cases of multiple sclerosis. This refined method of hybridization in situ, which can be useful in the search for covert virus infections of man, provides evidence that viruses may be involved in multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1982927929,"The gene for prolactin has been located on chromosome 6 in humans. DNA fragments of 4.8 and 4.0 kilobases containing prolactin gene sequences were identified in human genomic DNA, whereas DNA fragments of 7.4, 3.6, and 3.3 kilobases containing prolactin gene sequences were found in mouse cells. In somatic cell hybrids of human and mouse cells the 7.4-, 3.6-, and 3.3-kilobase mouse fragments were always present, whereas the 4.8- and 4.0-kilobase human fragments were only present when human chromosome 6 was also present. We conclude that the prolactin gene resides on chromosome 6, a different location from those of the genes for the related hormones chorionic somatomammotropin and growth hormone."

https://openalex.org/W2051282023,"The role of brain cholecystokinin peptides in satiety was further assessed by using antibody to cholecystokinin to reduce cholecystokinin activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of sheep. Food intakes were increased approximately 100 percent during the 2-hour continuous injection of antibody into the cerebrospinal fluid. This supports the hypothesis that, during feeding, cholecystokinin is released into the cerebrospinal fluid, which transports it to the receptors that elicit satiety."
https://openalex.org/W1522757325,"The reactions of reduced forms of liver microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase both with oxygen and with several oxygenatable substrates have been investigated using rapid reaction techniques. It was first shown that the pH optimum was at about 8.8 and that at pH values below 8 the stoichiometry was very nearly 1:1:1 for NADPH/(cysteamine or methimazole)/oxygen consumption, with only traces of H2O2 forming. Low temperatures (approximately 4 degrees C) were employed to better resolve kinetic intermediates occurring in the reaction. It was shown that in the absence of NADP+, substrate has no effect on the rate of reoxidation of reduced enzyme by O2. However, in the presence of NADP+ and the absence of substrate, the reduced enzyme reacts with O2 to form a remarkably stable C(4a)-hydroperoxyflavin species. This occurs in a reaction that saturates with respect to O2, implying the formation of a reversible complex with oxygen prior to the formation of the hydroperoxyflavin. This has been predicted by the steady state kinetics (Poulsen, L. L., and Ziegler, D. M. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6449-6455). In the presence of NADP+, substrate increases the rate of reoxidation (by destabilizing the hydroperoxyflavin), but the rate is much slower than the reaction of reduced enzyme with O2 in the absence of NADP+. The stability of the hydroperoxyflavin permitted its preparation on the stopped flow apparatus for subsequent reaction with various substrates. This reaction involved the rapid formation of a species with a new spectrum which was indicative of a C(4a)-substituted flavin. Since this new species converts to oxidized flavin at about 2 min-1, which is equivalent to Vmax, it must be the rate-limiting step in the catalytic reaction. This new spectrum is likely due either to a substrate-hydroperoxyflavin species or to a product-hydroxyflavin species."

https://openalex.org/W1977721529,"The A/J mouse has been used to study the teratogenic effects of phenytoin. The developmental abnormalities produced in offspring of this model are similar to some of the malformations observed in cases of human ""fetal hydantoin syndrome."" Placing pregnant A/J mice in a hyperoxic chamber after phenytoin injection greatly reduces the incidence of phenytoin-induced cleft lip and palate. These results suggest that phenytoin may affect embryonic development indirectly by altering maternal physiology. This maternally mediated mechanism, and the protection against it afforded by hyperoxia, has general implications for the effects of maternal toxicity on teratogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1601090389,"Each variant of histone 2A from mouse L1210 cells separates into at lest three bands on acid-urea gels, an unmodified band b0, and modified bands b1, b2, and, in the case of H2A.Z, b3. By analyzing tryptic peptides from these proteins on 50% acrylamide peptide gels, one can quantitate the fraction of H2A modified in various ways. With this methodology, the b1 form of H2A.1 was found to be a mixture of molecules, two-thirds of which were acetylated at lysine5 and one-third of which were phosphorylated at serine1. The b2 band of H2A.1 contained molecules with phosphorylated serine1, acetylated lysine5, and one or two other sites of modification not found in b1 H2A.1 b2 H2A.1 was not composed solely of molecules each with both a phosphorylated serine1 and an acetylated lysine5. The heteromorphous H2A variant H2A.X can be phosphorylated and acetylated. The phosphorylation site was the same as in H2A.1, but the acetylation site was slightly different. The heteromorphous variant H2A.Z was different from the other H2As in that it was not phosphorylated, and it did not contain the NH2-terminal peptide, which is the phosphorylation site in the .X, .1, and .2 variants. Its acetylation pattern was also different from that of H2A.1 in that two sites, neither of which was found in H2A.1, seem to be involved at the first level of modification."

https://openalex.org/W78959920,"A protein with immunoglobulin M-polymerizing activity was isolated from the membrane fraction of mouse plasmacytoma cells secreting pentamer IgM. The isolation was achieved by taking advantage of the solubility of the protein in 50% ammonium sulfate, its relatively high net negative charge, and its sedimentation at 4.2 S. Analyses of the purified preparations showed that the polymerizing protein catalyzes the assembly of pentamer IgM in vitro; less than 1 mol of enzyme/10 mol of monomer IgM and 2 ml of J chain were found to promote 50% polymerization. Evidence that the enzyme also plays an essential role in the in vivo assembly process was obtained from the reaction rates of the polymerization catalyzed in vitro, the similarity between the pentamer IgM molecules synthesized in vitro and in vivo, and the finding that polymerizing enzyme is a specific product of B lymphocytes. Analyses of the mechanism of polymerization suggested that polymerizing enzyme is a sulfhydryl oxidase; it was found to be inactivated by chelating agents and to resemble Cu2+ in catalyzing the formation of IgM intersubunit disulfide bonds. These results raise the possibility that the assembly of pentamer IgM does not involve disulfide interchange is previously thought, but proceeds by the direct oxidation of monomer IgM and J chain sulfhydryls."
https://openalex.org/W1986234649,"Metronidazole is a drug used for the treatment of trichomonal vaginitis, amebiasis, giardiasis, and certain anaerobic bacterial infections in humans. Acetamide and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)oxamic acid are metabolites of metronidazole in the rat, and we find small amounts of both metabolites in the urine of human patients taking the drug. Although acetamide is carcinogenic for rats, we do not believe that our finding further defines metronidazole's risk for humans. That risk can only be estimated from surveillance of people previously exposed to the drug."

https://openalex.org/W2102011056,"Fusion of fresh lymphocytes from a Bloom syndrome (BS) patient with those of normal subjects or a BS heterozygote resulted in complete normalization of the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in the chromosomes of BS cells. This normalization took place by the first mitosis in hybrid cells. In contrast, cultivation of BS lymphocytes with those of normal subjects or the BS heterozygote had no effect on sister chromatid exchanges. The cell fusion experiments suggest that the normalization of the sister chromatid exchange frequencies in BS cells can be achieved by factors conserved in the cells of various mammalian species. These findings are compatible with the concept that BS is a recessive genetic mutation at regulatory levels of the DNA repair function."

The gonads were cultured in vitro with or without their mesonephric tissue. When gonads and ducts removed from sexually undifferentiated fetuses were cultured together, the gonads of both sexes developed female characteristics, whereas gonads cultured without mesonephros developed according to the sex of the fetus from which they were removed. Gonads of sexually differentiated fetuses developed whether they were cultured with or without the mesonephros."
https://openalex.org/W1972134307,"The use of tanning booths as a substitute for natural sunlight is becoming increasingly popular. However, unless careful attention is paid to proper design and maintenance, the radiation field inside a tanning booth can be highly anisotropic. The use of simple, inexpensive ultraviolet radiation meters to measure dosage can lead to serious overexposure. Since the ultraviolet radiation inside a tanning booth has a greater proportion of short wavelengths (< 300 nanometers) than natural sunlight, the amount of skin cancer-inducing radiation received for a tan may be twice that received for a natural suntan."

https://openalex.org/W1569101766,"The blood of the Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) contains four hemoglobin components separable by chromatography on diethylaminoethylcellulose. These components are stable and functionally identical in their reactions with carbon monoxide. At low pH they remain in the T state even when liganded, and show two kinetic components in binding and in dissociation, with rates of 1) 1.2 microM-1 s-1 and 0.095 s-1 and 2) 0.013 microM-1 s-1 and 0.195 s-1, respectively, at pH 6, 20 degrees C, 0.1 m KPi. These components have difference spectra separated by more than 2 nm and are present in equal amounts. After CO has bound, there is a conformation change to an altered T state, in terms of the model of Monod et al. (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J. P. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118), with a half-time of 65 s. At equilibrium, one-third of the slow kinetic component is changed into the new conformer, which binds CO at a rate of 0.14 microM-1 s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1975813053,"Hearing subjects unfamiliar with American Sign Language and deaf native signers made triadic comparisons of movements of the hands and arms isolated from American Sign Language. Clustering and scaling of subjects' judgments revealed different psychological representations of movement form for deaf and hearing observers. Linguistically relevant dimensions acquired modified salience for users of a visual-gestural language. The data indicate that the modification of natural perceptual categories after language acquisition is not bound to a particular transmission modality, but rather can be a more general consequence of acquiring a formal linguistic system."

https://openalex.org/W1565916128,"CO binding to the Root effect hemoglobin of menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus, has been studied by flash photolysis and equilibrium measurements in [bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]Tris(hydroxymethyl)methane and Tris buffers, containing 0.2 M NaCl, between pH 6.0 and 8.0. The equilibrium and kinetic data were analyzed according to the two-state model, extended to include chain differences. The calculated value of the allosteric constant, L, varied from 3 X 10(6) at pH 6.0 to 20 at pH 8.0, lower at each pH value than that computed for phosphate buffer. In addition, the intrinsic rate constants of both T and R states were found to vary with pH. The kinetics of CO binding and of proton release, followed by absorbance changes in the pH indicator dye phenol red, were observed in 0.2 M NaCl, at pH values ranging from 6.3 to 7.8. Proton release lags behind CO binding across this pH range, the larger lags occurring at lower pH; this suggests that some proton release is associated with quaternary conformational change. The CO binding progress curves in unbuffered solution were simulated by the two-state model; in these calculations the value of L was systematically changed during the course of the reaction. The time courses of reaction intermediates, obtained from these computations, were then used to represent the kinetics of proton release. A simple model, assuming that proton release accompanies quaternary conformational transition but a modified model, incorporating pH dependence of the intrinsic T and R state affinities, describes proton release across the pH range studied."
https://openalex.org/W1594772314,"Nuclease-(1-126), although containing 89% of the amino acid sequence which folds to the ordered structure of nuclease A, is disordered and highly flexible (Taniuchi, H., and Anfinsen, C. B. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 243, 4778-4786). On the other hand, Sachs et al. (Sachs, D. H., Schechter, A. N., Eastlake, A., and Anfinsen, C. B. (1974) Nature 251, 242-244) have demonstrated intrinsic enzymatic activity for nuclease-(1-126). To attempt to learn whether or not the active population of nuclease-(1-126) has the native conformation, we have examined nuclease-(1-126) with respect to enzymatic kinetics with and without the competitive inhibitor deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate (pdTp), effect of temperature on enzymatic activity, binding of pdTp in the presence of Ca2+ and intrinsic viscosity, Stokes radius, CD, and response to trypsin action in the presence and absence of pdTp and Ca2+. The results indicate that the conformation of nuclease-(1-126) bound with pdTp in the presence of Ca2+ is partially constrained but still highly flexible below 30 degrees C, outside the range of thermal transition exhibited by the ordered elements of nuclease-(1-126). Thus, formation or stabilization of active site of nuclease-(1-126) by binding with ligands is not associated with cooperative folding of the entire polypeptide chain. Considering that nuclease-(1-126) does not bind to nuclease-(127-149) but does to nuclease-(111-149), the results are consistent with the idea that the specific cooperative interactions, providing extra stabilizing energy required for maintaining the polypeptide chain in the ordered state of nuclease A, may be disrupted for nuclease-(1-126) primarily due to cleavage of the peptide bond between residues 126 and 127. Then, it may be thought that binding with ligands does not compensate for this disruption."
https://openalex.org/W1616815515,"The spectra, ligand-binding properties, and conformational change of carbamylated human hemoglobin A, specifically modified at its alpha-NH2 groups, have been compared with those of hemoglobin A. In the Soret region, the spectra of all deoxyhemoglobins are identical. The Soret bands of carbonmonoxy alpha 2c beta 2 and alpha 2 beta 2c are shifted in opposite directions relative to hemoglobin A, alpha 2c beta 2 having its Soret band at the longer wavelength. Carbamylation of either chain slows oxygen dissociation from the alpha chain in the R-state, although the effect is larger for alpha 2c beta 2 and alpha 2c beta 2c than alpha 2 beta 2c. Carbamylation of either chain also slowed oxygen binding to the alpha chain while the rate for the beta chain is not changed significantly, indicating that the chains influence each other in the R-state. The rates of oxygen binding after full and partial laser photolysis of oxygen-saturated alpha 2c beta 2 appear identical. The rate of oxygen rebinding for alpha 2 beta 2c, after partial (10%) photolysis is the same as that for alpha 2c beta 2, but following full photolysis, biphasic rebinding was observed due to the appearance of T-state molecules. Carbon monoxide binding studies under photostationary conditions suggested an L value for alpha 2c beta 2c smaller than that for alpha 2 beta 2c and hemoglobin A. The R to T transition of the deoxy form of alpha 2c beta 2 is abut 10 times slower than hemoglobin A. Carbamylation of the beta chain does not slow the transition, indicating that carbamylation of the chain affects the allosteric equilibrium in deoxyhemoglobin. To a reasonable approximation with minimum assumptions, all of the observations made in this study may be rationalized using the two-state model of Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J. P. ((1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118)."
