https://openalex.org/W2020019505,"The stable-carbon isotope ratios for the flesh of marine and terrestrial animals from Canada's Pacific coast differ by 7.9 +/- 0.4 per mil, reflecting the approximately 7 per mil difference between oceanic and atmospheric carbon. This difference is passed on to human consumers. The carbon isotopic values (delta(13)C) for human collagen thus yield direct information on the relative amounts of marine and terrestrial foods in prehistoric diets."
https://openalex.org/W2085387089,"Direct spherical agglomeration of salicylic acid crystals during crystallization is described. The needle-like salicylic acid crystals simultaneously form and agglomerate in a mixture of three partially miscible liquids, such as water, ethanol, and chloroform, with agitation. The agglomerates can be made directly into tablets because of their excellent flowability. Spherical crystallization could eliminate the usual separate agglomeration step after crystallization and may be adaptable to other pharmaceutical and chemical systems."
https://openalex.org/W2064083382,"Large euhedral crystals of calcium carbonate hexahydrate were recovered from a shelf basin of the Bransfield Strait, Antarctic Peninsula, at a water depth of 1950 meters and sub-zero bottom water temperatures. The chemistry, mineralogy, and stable isotope composition of this hydrated calcium carbonate phase, its environment of formation, and its mode of precipitation confirm the properties variously attributed to hypothetical precursors of the glendonites and thereby greatly expand their use in paleoceanographic interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W2088172714,"Judged association between two variables represented on scatterplots increased when the scales on the horizontal and vertical axes were simultaneously increased so that the size of the point cloud within the frame of the plot decreased. Judged association was very different from the correlation coefficient, r, which is the most widely used measure of association."

https://openalex.org/W2169818652,"ing's vector it follows that the light amplitude at the focal spot would reach 108 volts per centimeter, comparable to the electric field internal to the atoms and molecules responsible for the binding of valence electrons. These are literally pulled out of their orbits in multiphoton tunneling processes, and any material will be converted to a highly ionized dense plasma at these flux densities. It is clear that the familiar notion of a linear optical response with a constant index of refraction, that is, an induced polarization proportional to the amplitude of the light field, should be dropped at much less extreme intensities. There is a nonlinearity in the constitutive relationship which may be expanded in terms of a power series in the electric field components"
https://openalex.org/W2007766194,Dry-tilt measurements at two stations indicate that Soufriere Volcano gradually inflated at least 10 microradians prior to the initial explosions of April 1979 and then rapidly deflated more than 20 microradians after the activity got under way. The tilt measured at the station 6.5 kilometers from the summit was about twice that measured at a distance of 2.5 kilometers. This finding suggests the existence of a magma chamber at a depth of more than 10 kilometers.
https://openalex.org/W2059032100,"Rapid response by earth, atmospheric, and space scientists made possible diverse observations during the explosive phase of the 1979 eruption of Soufriere Volcano. The 11 reports that follow indicate that, with the availability of appropriate personnel, equipment, and logistical support, a significant body of geophysical data can be gathered on short notice at erupting volcanoes in remote parts of the world."
https://openalex.org/W1974380103,"Legal arrangements governing a plant breeder's intellectual property rights to his inventions are likely to affect the future of crop research. Such systems, although controversial, are probably currently desirable for the developed world. The new genetic technologies may change this judgment, and certainly require redefinition of the lines between plant patents and regular patents. Several safeguards, present in the United States breeder's rights law, should be applied more broadly. A new safeguard-of ensuring that material be entered into germplasm banks-should be applied everywhere. For the developing world, the desirability of a plant patent system is much less clear; new agreements may be desirable to ensure the free flow and collection of germplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2093359414,"During its April 1979 eruption series, Soufriere Volcano produced two major stratospheric plumes that the SAGE (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment) satellite system tracked to West Africa and the North Atlantic Ocean. The total mass of these plumes, whose movement and dispersion are in agreement with those deduced from meteorological data and dispersion theory, was less than 0.5 percent of the global stratospheric aerosol burden; no significant temperature or climate perturbation is therefore expected."
https://openalex.org/W2022778566,"The size distributions of fine particles measured at tropospheric altitudes in the periphery of the eruption plume formed during the 17 April 1979 eruption of Soufriere Volcano and in the low-level effluents on 15 May 1979 were found to be bimodal, having peak concentrations at geometric mean diameters of 1.1 and 0.23 micrometers. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis of the samples revealed an abundance of aluminum and silicon and traces of sodium, magnesium, chlorine, potassium, calcium, and iron in the large-particle mode. The submicrometer-sized particles were covered with liquid containing sulfur, assumed to be in the form of liquid sulfuric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2094922390,"The explosive phase of the 1979 Soufriere eruption produced 37.5 x 10(6) cubic meters (dense-rock equivalent) of tephra, consisting of about 40 percent juvenile basaltic andesite and 60 percent of a nonjuvenile component derived from the fragmentation of the 1971-1972 lava island during phreatomagmatic explosions. The unusually fine grain size, poor sorting, and bimodality of the land deposit are attributed to particle aggregation and the formation of accretionary lapilli in a wet eruption column."

https://openalex.org/W2036281578,"Aerosol samples collected from the 17 April 1979 eruption plume of Soufriere, St. Vincent, at altitudes between 1.8 and 5.5 kilometers were physically and chemically very similar to the ash that fell on the island. Higher altitude samples (7.3 and 9.5 kilometers) had a much lower ash content but comparable concentrations of sulfate, which were above the background concentration found at these altitudes."
https://openalex.org/W2081747718,"Six gas samples from the 17 April 1979 Soufriere eruption plume were analyzed for carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, fluorocarbon-11, fluorocarbon-12, methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. Only carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonyl sulfide, and carbon disulfide were found to have increased mixing ratios as compared with those in clean tropospheric air, but the increases were not sufficient to contribute greatly to the global budgets of these four components."
https://openalex.org/W2009695308,"At the time of the Soufriere, St. Vincent, volcanic eruption of 17 April 1979, a NASA P-3 aircraft with an uplooking lidar (light detection and ranging) system onboard was airborne 130 kilometers east of the island. Lidar measurements of the fresh volcanic ash were made approximately 2 hours after the eruption, 120 kilometers to the northeast and east. On the evening of 18 April, the airborne lidar, on a southerly flight track, detected significant amounts of stratospheric material in layers at 16, 17, 18, and 19.5 kilometers. These data, and measurements to the north on 19 April, indicate that the volcanic plume penetrated the stratosphere to an altitude of about 20 kilometers and moved south during the first 48 hours after the eruption."
https://openalex.org/W2023100932,"Meteorological upper-air data, in conjunction with satellite imagery, lidar light detection and ranging returns, and aircraft sampling, aid in the determination of plume altitude and transport. The estimated trajectories indicate that the ash was transported eastward across the Atlantic to Africa in 3 to 5 days and that there was modest meridional transport as far as 15 degrees poleward during the first week of travel."
https://openalex.org/W2039240735,"Infrared images from the geostationary satellite SMS-1 were used to study the growth of the eight major eruptions of Soufriere, St. Vincent, during April 1979. These eruptions differed considerably in growth and intensity, the most intense being that of 17 April which formed an ash cloud of 96,000 square kilometers in 4 hours. The weakest eruption formed a cloud of only 16,000 square kilometers."
https://openalex.org/W2061528622,"A fortuitous and dramatic photograph of the Soufriere eruption column of 17 April 1979 displays a series of highly structured skirt clouds. The gentle distortion of thin, quasi-horizontal layers of moist air has been documented in meteorological situations. It is proposed that at St. Vincent subhorizontal layers of moist air were intensely deformed by the rapidly rising eruption column and were carried to higher altitudes, where they condensed to form the skirt clouds."

https://openalex.org/W2082487041,"In April 1979, measurements of nitrogen dioxide in the upper atmosphere were made near Soufriere Volcano by twilight optical-absorption techniques. The derived value of 5 x 10(15) molecules per square centimeter column implies an enhancement of 25 percent over earlier abundances measured in the same latitudinal regions. This enhancement may represent the normal stratospheric variability of nitrogen dioxide in the equatorial region but in any case may be considered an upper limit to the volcano's effect on the total nitrogen dioxide abundance."
