Removal of both optic glands after spawning results in cessation of broodiness, resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended life-span. Optic gland secretions may cause death of most cephalopods and may function to control population size."

Yields of rubber and wax, glycerides, isoprenoids, and other terpenoids were estimated. Individual sterols were identified in latex from some species."
https://openalex.org/W2050478612,"Ordinary chondrites, like carbonaceous chondrites, contain primordial noble gases mainly in a minor phase comprising </=0.05 percent of the meteorite, probably an iron-chromium sulfide. The neon-20/argon-36 ratios decrease with increasing argon-36 concentration, as expected if the gas pattern was established by condensation from the solar nebula, and was negligibly altered by metamorphism in the meteorite parent bodies. Meteoritic and planetary matter apparently condensed over a substantial range of temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2000217594,"In Tetrahymena thermophila the major argument for the existence of diploid subunits has been that some loci show a delay in the accumulation of stable subclones during macronuclear assortment. This delay is based on the assumption that throughout the life cycle there are 45 subunits. We find that for at least 50 fissions after conjugation there is sufficient DNA for 66 haploid subunits. These additional subunits early in the life cycle are sufficient to explain the observed accumulation of stable subclones in all instances. This removes the need to invoke diploidy to explain assortment, thus resolving the question of subunit ploidy in favor of haploidy."
https://openalex.org/W1996751759,"No uniform international approach for handling the problem of high-level radioactive waste disposal exists. All the while, the volume of these wastes continues to grow. The only viable solution to the disposal problem is a geologic one. Burial of these wastes in solid form for long periods of time in mined cavities in salt or Precambrian crystalline rock formations is technically possible. Several steps in the burial process have already been demonstrated in Germany. The problem becomes more serious as the number of countries committed to the use of nuclear energy grows. If one considers the problems of seismic stability and worldwide distribution of salt deposits, the overwhelming need for an international solution to the waste disposal problem seems obvious."

https://openalex.org/W2148391489,On five occasions during the first half of 1976 traces of neptunium-239 and molybdenum-99 were detected in southern Sweden. These activities were accompanied by small amounts of fission products such as iodine-131 and barium-140. One of the events was coincident in time with large peaks in the atmospheric tritium gas concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2064463198,"The role of laboratories and research centers, never fully defined by ERDA, has been reviewed by DOE officials, who indicate a gradual change in future administrative procedures is likely. Reorganization into a new department has changed reporting procedures and added new ways to monitor laboratory work. This has raised concerns that the laboratories will lose much of their past economic and program autonomy, which some critics felt were too lacking in competitive bidding and too ambitious. Future changes are expected to include more specific energy objectives for each facility and a resolution of whether the labs should be centers of excellence only or should interact as consultants and managers with outside agencies and contractors. The laboratories are grouped under solar research, weapons, energy research, nuclear fission and fusion development, basic research, and multipurpose according to their present emphasis. They are expected to remain at the same size (60,000 employees) and will not enlarge at the expense of university research."

https://openalex.org/W1979776135,"The new United Nations University, which began its initial operations in September 1975, now includes programs on the alleviation of world hunger, on human and social development, and on the use and management of natural resources. The university is beginning to fulfill its mandate to organize top scientific and scholarly collaboration to help identify and alleviate pressing global problems of human survival, development, and welfare. This new university does not have a campus, students, or degree courses, but rather it was founded on a unique concept whereby it operates from the central planning and coordinating center in Tokyo through networks of institutions and scholars all over the world. In order to achieve its goals, the U.N. University organizes associated institutions and scholars to (1) identify critical international problems, (2) to undertake internationally coordinate research and advanced training, (3) to strengthen research and advanced training resources in developing countries, (4) to disseminate the research results both to scholars and decision-makers, and (5) to encourage mission-oriented multidisciplinary research and advanced training."
