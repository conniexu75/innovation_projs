https://openalex.org/W2117007075,"A key goal of biomedical research is to elucidate the complex network of gene interactions underlying complex traits such as common human diseases. Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying and experimentally validating the involvement of three new genes in susceptibility to obesity."

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which extracellular matrix molecules modulate osteogenic stem cells and bone formation. Using mice deficient in two members of the small leucine-rich proteoglycans, biglycan and decorin, we uncovered a role for these two extracellular matrix proteoglycans in modulating bone formation from bone marrow stromal cells. Our studies showed that the absence of the critical transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-binding proteoglycans, biglycan and decorin, prevents TGF-β from proper sequestration within the extracellular matrix. The excess TGF-β directly binds to its receptors on bone marrow stromal cells and overactivates its signaling transduction pathway. Overall, the predominant effect of the increased TGF-β signaling in bgn/dcn-deficient bone marrow stromal cells is a “switch in fate” from growth to apoptosis, leading to decreased numbers of osteoprogenitor cells and subsequently reduced bone formation. Thus, biglycan and decorin appear to be essential for maintaining an appropriate number of mature osteoblasts by modulating the proliferation and survival of bone marrow stromal cells. These findings underscore the importance of the micro-environment in controlling the fate of adult stem cells and reveal a novel cellular and molecular basis for the physiological and pathological control of bone mass.

ECM components modulate the bioactivities of growth factors and cytokines, such as TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and platelet-derived growth factor, by 1) activating them by proteolytic processing (4Munger J.S.

Proteoglycans, which are characterized by a core protein with at least one glycosaminoglycan chain attached, commonly mediate the interactions of ECM components with growth factors and cytokines (12Schonherr E. Hausser H.J. Dev. Immunol. 2000; 7: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) are some of the major non-collagen components of the ECM (13Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The core proteins of the SLRPs consist of leucine-rich repeats flanked by two cysteine-rich clusters. The size of the core proteins (∼40 kDa) is relatively small compared with aggrecan and versican (>200 kDa) (1Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 10Iozzo R.V. Moscatello D.K. McQuillan D.J. Eichstetter I. J. Biol.

The SLRP superfamily currently consists of 13 known members that can be divided into 3 distinct subfamilies based on the genomic organization, structure, and similarity of their amino acid sequences (13Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). SLRPs are involved in skeletal growth (15Ameye L. Young M.F.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). However, to date, little is known about the precise mechanism through which SLRPs regulate the formation and maintenance of the skeletal system. Biglycan (Bgn) and decorin (Dcn) are class I type SLRPs that are expressed in various tissues (7Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 15Ameye L. Young M.F. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 107R-116RCrossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 21Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Young M.F. Termine J.D. Robey P.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 1549-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), including bones and teeth. Mice with targeted disruption of the bgn gene have impaired postnatal bone formation, which leads to the early onset of osteoporosis (16Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Although Dcn-deficient mice do not show histological or macroscopical changes in bone (17Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B. Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Robey P.G. Bianco P. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), they do contain collagen fibrils of abnormal size distribution, density, and shape in mineralized tissue (15Ameye L. Young M.F. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 107R-116RCrossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 17Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B. Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Robey P.G. Bianco P. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because of the similarity of their primary sequences as well as their overlapping expression patterns in skeletal tissues, it is not surprising that Bgn and Dcn function redundantly and synergistically. Mice deficient in both bgn and dcn display more severe defects than mice deficient in either bgn or dcn, in tissues, such as bone and skin, where Bgn and Dcn are coexpressed (17Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B. Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Robey P.G. Bianco P. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Bgn and Dcn may share some common functions in bone and skin and compensate, at least in part, for each other when one is deleted. To eliminate the potential compensation, it is, therefore, necessary to use mice deficient in multiple proteoglycans. Our specific approach was to use bgn/dcn-deficient mice to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ECM proteoglycans in regulating osteogenesis. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which contain skeletal stem cells (also known as mesenchymal stem cells), are derived from clonogenic adherent bone marrow cells, which are colony-forming units-fibroblastic. Under certain conditions, BMSCs can give rise to osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, myelo-supportive stroma, and even muscle and nerve tissue (22Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (17647) Google Scholar, 23Bianco P. Riminucci M. Gronthos S. Robey P.G. Stem. Cells. 2001; 19: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 24Owen M. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1988; 10: 63-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells have been used for both in vivo and in vitro studies to understand the mechanisms that modulate skeletal formation and pathological changes in bone disease. In vivo xenogenic transplantation of BMSCs mimics bone formation where transplanted BMSCs can form a miniature bone organ that contains bone, adipocytes, and hematopoiesis-supporting stroma. They can form cartilage in micromass cultures in vitro (23Bianco P. Riminucci M. Gronthos S. Robey P.G. Stem. Cells. 2001; 19: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar, 25Friedenstein A.J. Piatetzky II, S. Petrakova K.V. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1966; 16: 381-390PubMed Google Scholar). BMSCs have also been used to examine the ability of osteogenic stem cells to proliferate, differentiate, and form mineral nodules in vitro (25Friedenstein A.J. Piatetzky II, S. Petrakova K.V. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1966; 16: 381-390PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bianco P. Robey P.G. Nature. 2001; 414: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). BMSCs, therefore, permit in-depth analysis of the signal transduction pathways that regulate proliferation, survival, and differentiation of osteogenic stem cells. In the current studies, we utilized BMSCs from bgn/dcn-deficient mice to examine the combined effects of Bgn and Dcn on bone formation. We found that BMSCs deficient in both SLRPs have increased TGF-β signaling due to the inability to sequester TGF-β in the ECM by Bgn and Dcn, resulting in switched fate from growth to apoptosis. The premature death of osteogenic stem cells and osteoblast precursors led to a decreased number of mature osteoblasts thereby contributing to decreased osteogenesis and an osteoporosis-like phenotype in bgn/dcn-deficient mice. Our studies demonstrate, for the first time, an unsuspected role for these two SLRPs in controlling bone mass by regulating TGF-β activity, which in turn modulated the proliferation and survival of osteogenic stem cells. This provides a new paradigm in understanding the molecular basis of osteoporosis caused by low bone formation. Animals—All experiments were performed using 8-week-old WT, and bgn/dcn-deficient C3H/HeNHsd male mice under an institutionally approved protocol for the use of animals in research (NIDCR-DIR-03-280). Generation of bgn/dcn-deficient mice has been previously reported (16Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B.

Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). The genotype of the WT (bgn+/0dcn+/+, bgn is on the X but not Y chromosome) and bgn/dcn-deficient (bgn-/0dcn-/-) mice was determined by a PCR-based assay as described previously (16Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.M. Sommer B. Satomura K. Dominguez P. Zhao C. Kulkarni A.B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Culture Medium and Preparation of BMSCs—The culture medium for BMSCs was α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 20% lot-selected fetal bovine serum (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (BioFluids, Rockville, MD), and 10 nm dexamethasone (Sigma). The osteogenic induction medium was the culture medium supplemented with 100 μm ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (WAKO, Tokyo), and 2 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma). Bone marrow cells (10-20 × 106) in culture medium containing 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen) were plated into a 100-mm tissue culture dish. The cells were incubated until ∼80% confluence (12-14 days) then washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. The adherent cells were detached with 200 units/ml collagenase, and plated for the experiments as described below for each assay. Colony Forming Efficiency—Colony forming efficiency assays were performed as previously described (27Chen X.D. Shi S. Xu T. Robey P.G. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 28Kuznetsov S. Gehron Robey P. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 59: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted using a dissecting microscope. Because each colony is theoretically formed from a single stem cell, this permits a direct estimate of the stem cell colony forming efficiency by counting the number of colonies formed by 1 × 106 marrow cells originally plated. Proliferation of BMSCs—BMSCs (3 × 104/well) were plated into an 8-well chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and cultured (5% CO2, 37 °C) overnight. The cells were labeled with bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling reagent (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) for 24 h and fixed in 70% alcohol for 20 min at 4 °C. The BrdUrd-labeled cells were visualized using the BrdUrd Staining Kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. In Vitro Calcium Accumulation—BMSCs (2 × 105/well) were plated into a 12-well plate and cultured until confluent. Culture medium was then replaced with osteogenic induction medium in the presence or absence of 200 ng/ml bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) (Wyeth Research, Cambridge, MA). After 6 weeks, calcium deposits were detected by staining with 2% Alizarin Red S (pH 4.2, Sigma). To quantify the stained nodules, the stain was solubilized with 0.5 ml of 5% SDS in 0.5 n HCl for 30 min at room temperature (29Kostenuik P.J. Halloran B.P. Morey-Holton E.R. Bikle D.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1133-E1139PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized stain (0.15 ml) was transferred to wells of a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. In Vivo Bone Formation—Approximately 3 × 106 BMSCs were mixed with 40 mg of hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate ceramic powder (Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IN) and then transplanted subcutaneously into the dorsal surface of 10-week-old immunocompromised beige mice (NIH-bg-nu-xid, Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) as previously described (30Krebsbach P.H. Kuznetsov S.A. Satomura K. Emmons R.V. Rowe D.W. Robey P.G. Transplantation. 1997; 63: 1059-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). These procedures were performed in accordance to specifications described in an animal protocol approved by an institutional review board (NIDCR 02-222). The transplants were harvested after 8-9 weeks, fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 2-3 days, decalcified with buffered 10% EDTA (pH 8.0) at 4 °C for 1-2 weeks, and then processed for standard paraffin embedding. Three representative H&E-stained histological sections for each transplant were chosen for the quantitation of new bone generated. The percentage of new bone formed in transplants was measured by computer assisted histomorphometry using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) or ImageJ (NIH Image, rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Western Blot Analysis—Confluent BMSCs were treated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or vehicle for 30 min or 48 h. The protein extraction and Western blot analyses were done as previously described (31Chen X.D. Fisher L.W. Robey P.G. Young M.F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies included rabbit anti-Bax, -Bad, -p-Smad2, and -Smad2 (1:500, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); rabbit anti-Hsp90 and -TGF-β receptor types I and II (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-Smad3 (1:500, Calbiochem); or rabbit anti-Cbfa1 (1:100, Oncogene Research Product, Cambridge, MA). Northern Blot Analysis—Confluent BMSCs were treated with 200 ng/ml BMP2 or vehicle in osteogenic induction medium for 2 weeks. The total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 Reagent (TEL-TEST “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Northern blot analyses were performed as previously described (31Chen X.D. Fisher L.W. Robey P.G. Young M.F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—BMSCs (5 × 104/well) were plated into a 24-well plate and cultured to confluence (5% CO2, 37 °C). The cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium media with 3% bovine serum albumin overnight, treated with vehicle or 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 in α-minimal essential medium media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The culture medium was collected for measurement of TGF-β concentration. Attached cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature for analysis of matrix-bound TGF-β1. Concentrations of TGF-β1 in the culture media were measured using the DuoSet Elisa Development System (R&D Systems). The TGF-β1 binding to cell surface and sequestered in the ECM was detected using a biotin-conjugated TGF-β1-specific antibody (chicken, 36 μg/ml, R&D Systems) after blocking nonspecific binding with Reagent Diluent (R&D Systems). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (R&D Systems) was added for 20 min to bind the immobilized biotinylated anti-TGF-β1 antibody. The substrate (tetramethylbenzidine/hydrogen peroxide, R&D Systems) reacted with horseradish peroxidase to develop color. Color development was stopped with 2 n H2SO4, and the intensity of the color was measured at A450 nm and corrected at A560 nm using a microplate reader. The amount of TGF-β1 was calculated from a TGF-β1 standard curve and was normalized by protein content. The protein content of attached cells was measured using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—BMSCs (1 × 105/well) were plated into a 12-well plate containing an 18-mm round coverslip (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) and cultured to 70-80% confluence (5% CO2, 37 °C). The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min at room temperature, washed with 0.1% (w/v) glycine (ICN, Aurora, OH) in DPBS, blocked 1 h at room temperature with 0.5% (w/v) casein (Sigma) in DPBS, and incubated with anti-TGF-β1 antibody (chicken, 1:50, R&D Systems) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with anti-chicken IgY∼fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody in DPBS (1:500, Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Specimens were washed with DPBS and again fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 10 min at room temperature, and washed with 0.1% glycine in DPBS. Specimens were mounted using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and immunoreactivity of the specimens was visualized using a Leica DM IRBE confocal microscope and the supplied software (Leica confocal software version 2.00). Apoptosis of BMSCs—BMSCs (3 × 104/well) were plated into an 8-well chamber slide and cultured for 2-3 days (5% CO2, 37 °C). The cells were then treated with vehicle or 1 μm staurosporine (Alexis, San Diego, CA) for 4 h or 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 48 h. At indicated time points, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with freshly prepared 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells undergoing apoptosis were detected by immunohistochemical staining with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP and nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay using the ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Caspase-3 Activity of BMSCs—Confluent BMSCs were treated with vehicle, 2 ng/ml TGF-β1, or 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 plus 3 μm caspase-3 inhibitor (benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone, BioVision, Mountain View, CA) in osteogenic induction medium for 5 or 6 h. The caspase-3 activity of BMSCs was measured using the BD ApoAlert™ Caspase Colorimetric Assay Kit (BD Biosciences) following procedures recommended by the manufacturer except that the caspase-3 activity was normalized by protein content. The protein content of cells was measured using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Immunohistochemistry—Mouse embryos were removed immediately prior to birth (E19.5), dissected, fixed in cold freshly prepared Millonig's Modified Phosphate Buffered formalin (Surgipath, St. Louis, MO) at 4 °C for 3 days, and then transferred into 70% ethanol. The fixed samples were processed for standard paraffin embedding and sectioning. Enzymatic immunochemistry staining of TGF-β was performed using the broad spectrum immunoperoxidase AEC kit (SuperPicTure™ Polymer Detection Kit, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The sections were blocked with 10% goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and incubated with specific primary antibody recognizing TGF-β1 (mouse, clone 9016, 1:50 in 10% goat serum, R&D Systems) or mouse IgG1 control at the same dilution (R&D Systems) overnight at 4 °C. Apoptotic cells were detected by immunohistochemical staining with a TUNEL assay using the KLE-NOW-FragEL™ DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit (Oncogene, San Diego, CA), following procedures recommended by the manufacturer. Microcomputed Tomography Analysis—Femurs were scanned and reconstructed with 8-μm isotropic voxels on a μCT system (eXplore MS, GE Medical Systems, London, Ontario, Canada). A bone standard (SB3, Gammex RMI, Middleton, WI) was also scanned using the same protocol and used for the calibration of bone mineral density measurements. The reconstructed three-dimensional imagines of distal femurs were analyzed using MicroView (GE Medical Systems, London, Ontario, Canada). A fixed threshold was used to separate the bone and marrow phase. The trabecular bone mineral density and bone volume per tissue volume in the distal femur were measured in an elliptical cylinder (1.3 × 0.6 × 1.9 mm) within the metaphysis. Statistical Analysis—All figures are representative of at least three experiments. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were done by using Student's t test. Osteogenesis of BMSCs Is Decreased in the Absence of Bgn and Dcn in Vitro and in Vivo—We have previously shown that bgn/dcn-deficient mice exhibit a more severe reduction in bone mass compared with wild-type (WT) mice or mice deficient in either bgn or dcn (17Corsi A. Xu T. Chen X.D. Boyde A. Liang J. Mankani M. Sommer B. Iozzo R.V. Eichstetter I. Robey P.G. Bianco P. Young M.F. J. Bone Miner Res. 2002; 17: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Microcomputed tomography (μCT) analysis showed that the trabecular bone mineral density and bone volume per tissue volume in the metaphyses of the distal femur of bgn/dcn-deficient mice were lower than WT mice at 6 weeks of age (Fig. 1). Moreover, the osteopenic phenotype was more profound with aging (Fig. 1). To investigate the cellular mechanism of this severe osteopenia in the absence of both Bgn and Dcn, we hypothesized that the defect in BMSCs could be related to impaired bone formation in bgn/dcn-deficient mice. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the ability of osteogenic stem cells to calcify in vitro using Alizarin Red S staining that allows visualization of Ca2+ accumulation. Ca2+ accumulation in bgn/dcn-deficient BMSC cultures was much lower than that in WT cell cultures (Fig. 2A). Because Ca2+ accumulation was relatively low in both WT and bgn/dcn-deficient cultures, we treated the BMSCs with BMP2, a stimulator of osteogenesis (32Hogan B.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 33Hoffmann A. Gross G. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2001; 11: 23-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMP2 dramatically increased Ca2+ accumulation (Fig. 2A, right). Quantitation of Alizarin Red S staining showed that Ca2+ accumulation in the cultures of BMSCs from bgn/dcn-deficient mice was 51.6 ± 4.4% less than that of WT cell cultures in the presence or absence of BMP2 (Fig. 2A, right). These results indicated that the in vitro calcification ability of BMSCs was decreased in the absence of Bgn and Dcn.Fig. 2The bone formation from BMSCs in vitro and in vivo decreases in the absence of Bgn and Dcn.

https://openalex.org/W2152456839,"Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a chromosomal fragility disorder that shares clinical and cellular features with ataxia telangiectasia. Here we demonstrate that Nbs1-null B cells are defective in the activation of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (Atm) in response to ionizing radiation, whereas ataxia-telangiectasia- and Rad3-related (Atr)-dependent signalling and Atm activation in response to ultraviolet light, inhibitors of DNA replication, or hypotonic stress are intact. Expression of the main human NBS allele rescues the lethality of Nbs1-/- mice, but leads to immunodeficiency, cancer predisposition, a defect in meiotic progression in females and cell-cycle checkpoint defects that are associated with a partial reduction in Atm activity. The Mre11 interaction domain of Nbs1 is essential for viability, whereas the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain is required for T-cell and oocyte development and efficient DNA damage signalling. Reconstitution of Nbs1 knockout mice with various mutant isoforms demonstrates the biological impact of impaired Nbs1 function at the cellular and organismal level."

https://openalex.org/W2024675721,"WSB-1 is a SOCS-box-containing WD-40 protein of unknown function that is induced by Hedgehog signalling in embryonic structures during chicken development. Here we show that WSB-1 is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the thyroid-hormone-activating type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2). The WD-40 propeller of WSB-1 recognizes an 18-amino-acid loop in D2 that confers metabolic instability, whereas the SOCS-box domain mediates its interaction with a ubiquitinating catalytic core complex, modelled as Elongin BC-Cul5-Rbx1 (ECS(WSB-1)). In the developing tibial growth plate, Hedgehog-stimulated D2 ubiquitination via ECS(WSB-1) induces parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), thereby regulating chondrocyte differentiation. Thus, ECS(WSB-1) mediates a mechanism by which 'systemic' thyroid hormone can effect local control of the Hedgehog-PTHrP negative feedback loop and thus skeletogenesis."

Here, we report multiple crystal structures of MR (NR3C2) bound to both agonist and antagonists.

In addition, most activating ligands hydrogen bond to Thr945 on helix 10. Structural characterization of the naturally occurring S810L mutant explains how stabilization of a helix 3/helix 5 interaction can circumvent the requirement for this hydrogen bond network.

(NR3C2) is a steroid hormone-regulated transcription factor that plays a physiological role in the regulation of water and electrolyte (primarily sodium and potassium) levels in mammals. Although its effects in the distal nephron of the kidney and colon are thought to have the largest influence on vascular blood pressure, MR is found in many tissues, including the brain and heart (1Rogerson F.M. Fuller P.J. Steroids. 2000; 65: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 2Agarwal M.K. Mirshahi M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 273-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Lombes M.

Physiol. 2001; 280: F181-F192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MR is comprised of 784 amino acids and is the longest member of the oxosteroid receptor subgroup of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, which includes the androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and progesterone receptors (PR) (5Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). Amino acid alignments show that these receptors are very similar and contain three major functional domains: an N-terminal activation domain, a central DNA binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Besides containing all of the determinants for binding hormone, the LBD also contains the C-terminal activation function-2 helix (AF-2). Crystal structures of several NR LBDs have shown that correct positioning of the AF-2 is required for recruitment of coactivators of transcription (8Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E.

Understanding the ligand requirements that lead to the proper positioning of the AF-2 and activation of MR is fundamental to designing drugs that can modulate receptor activation. Within the body, MR is exposed to many steroids including cortisol, cortisone, and progesterone; however aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone (DOC) are considered the physiological MR ligands (Fig. 1). Circulating levels of the glucocorticoid cortisol, a potent MR binder and activator, may reach 1,000-fold over aldosterone (7Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In epithelial tissues, high levels of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 convert cortisol to cortisone by converting the C-11 hydroxyl to the corresponding ketone (13Funder J.W. Pearce P.T. Smith R. Smith A.I. Science. 1988; 242: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 14Stewart P.M. Edwards C.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This simple conversion results in a steroid incapable of activating MR. In a similar manner, progesterone levels are elevated over those of native MR ligands, especially during pregnancy (15Johansson E.D. Jonasson L.E. Acta Obstet. Gynecol.

Although there appear to be mechanisms in place for the conversion of this steroid to other metabolites, progesterone is normally a weak activator of MR even though it is known to bind with high affinity (17Alnemri E.S.

This is particularly interesting because DOC, which differs from progesterone only at the C-21 position, is a potent activator of MR (11Rupprecht R. Reul J.M. van Steensel B. Spengler D. Soder M.

The synthetic steroid spironolactone (Fig. 1) has been used as an antihypertensive agent for decades and has recently received renewed interest as a treatment for congestive heart failure (23Corvol P.

Spironolactone is characterized by a C-17 γ-lactone ring and a C-7 thioester, but the molecular mechanism for the antagonist activity of the steroid has not been determined. Although crystallographic studies of other steroid hormone receptors have demonstrated the key role of the C-3 keto group in anchoring the steroid in the receptor binding pocket, the roles of other substituents of steroidal ligands have not been as clearly defined (9Bledsoe R.K.

A crystal structure of MR bound to an agonist or antagonist would therefore be useful in understanding the ligand requirements for modulation of MR activity. In this report, we describe the crystal structures of MR bound to aldosterone, DOC, and progesterone. In addition, we describe the structure of the MR S810L mutant bound to progesterone, cortisone, and spironolactone. These structural studies, along with functional data from mutants, have revealed ligand requirements for MR activation and provide a rationale for the antagonistic activity of progesterone and spironolactone. Construct Design and Protein Expression of Human MR LBD—A PCR was used to amplify the DNA encoding amino acids 712-984 of MR (GenBank M16801). The forward oligonucleotide contained a BamHI site, and the reverse oligonucleotide contained a HindIII site, which allowed for directional cloning of the amplified product into the modified His6-GST pET-24 vector (Novagen) digested with the same enzymes and described previously for the expression of GR (9Bledsoe R.K.

For the C808S and C808S/S810L mutants, two complementary oligonucleotides for each desired mutation were constructed: forward primer (C808S), 5′-GTA TTC TTG GAT GTC TCT ATC ATC ATT TGC CT-3′; reverse primer (C808S), 5′-AGG CAA ATG ATG ATA GAG ACA TCC AAG AAT AC-3′; and forward primer (C808S/S810L), 5′-TCT TGG ATG TCT CTA TTA TCA TTT GCC T-3′; reverse primer (C808S/S810L), 5′-AGG CAA ATG ATA ATA GAG ACA TCC AAG A-3′. The underlined bolded letters depict the base changes from the wild type human MR sequence. The MR LBD (amino acids 712-984) cloned into the modified His6-GST pET-24 vector was used as the backbone to create the mutants. Sequences of the final constructs were confirmed. A thrombin protease site at the C terminus of the GST allows for cleavage of the resultant fusion protein following expression. For protein expression, BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen/Invitrogen) were transformed with the expression plasmids. Expression was performed similar to that described previously for GR (9Bledsoe R.K.

Crystallization Methods—The MR LBD-hormone complex was concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES pH 7.0, ∼190 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% β-octyl glucoside. Crystals were grown at room temperature in hanging drops containing 3.0 μl of the above protein buffer solution and 1-5 μl of well buffer (0.8-1.0 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m HEPES pH 7.5, 2% polyethylene glycol 2000 monomethyl ether). Crystals appeared over-night and grew continuously to 300 μm within a week. Diffracting crystals of MR were also obtained in the same conditions when micro-seeded with crushed MR·DOC crystals that were streaked with a horse tail hair. Before data collection, crystals were exchanged stepwise into the well buffer with an additional 25% ethylene glycol and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on either a MSC/Rigaku RU200 generator with a MAR345 Image Plate detector or at the Advanced Photon Source IMCA 17 ID beam line on an ADSC 210 detector. Regardless of the hardware, diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000. All crystals were in two related crystal forms with either the space group C2221 or P212121, depending on whether the noncrystallographic dimer relating two subunits became a crystallographic 2-fold. The first MR structure was solved by molecular replacement with the PR (PDB 1A28) using AMoRe. Several rounds of rebuilding with Quanta and refinement using CNX2002 resulted in the final models shown. All subsequent MR structures were obtained by molecular replacement with a refined MR model. All data collection and structure refinement parameters are included as supplemental data. Cell Culture—CV-1 cells were maintained for growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Passaging was performed every 3-4 days at a 1:10 dilution. For experiments, CV-1 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's) 1:1 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cell Transfection and Ligand Treatments—Expression plasmids were made by cloning the sequence encoding the full-length MR into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). MR mutations at amino acid 770 or amino acid 945 were made by designing overlapping primers containing the mutation of interest. The oligonucleotides were then used in a PCR with the wtMR pcDNA3 plasmid as a template. Resultant PCR products were digested with DpnI and used to transform DH5α maximum efficiency competent cells to isolate clones of interest. The full MR and promoter region sequence was verified in all mutants. Transfections were performed 24 h after cells were plated. Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was used for transfecting cells and performed essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cell-based reporter assays 10 ng of murine mammary tumor virus luciferase reporter, 4 ng of Renilla luciferase, 5 ng of MR expression plasmids, and varying amounts of pBluescript carrier plasmid were transfected into each well. Steroid dilutions were prepared in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's) 1:1 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Treatments included aldosterone, cortisol, DOC, progesterone, 11-hydroxyprogesterone (11-OH-P), and spironolactone (all at 1 μm). Cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of the steroids, after which the medium was assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase reporter activity was measured using the Dual Glo assay system (Promega).

In addition, expression studies with GR demonstrated that a single mutation at position 602 (F602S) led to increased expression and crystallization (9Bledsoe R.K. Montana V.G. Stanley T.B.

When the equivalent MR residue, cysteine 808, was mutated to a serine, a dramatic increase in soluble expression of a GST MR LBD in E. coli was observed (Fig. 2). The MR C808S mutant yielded significant levels of protein when expressed in the presence of the potent agonists aldosterone and DOC. After expression, the protein was purified and crystallized as described. Both MR-agonist complexes crystallized in the space group C2221 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit (see supplemental data). Overall, the MR LBD shows the three-layered α-helical fold observed in other nuclear receptor LBDs, with aldosterone bound in a fully enclosed pocket contacting residues in helices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 11, and the β-turn (Fig. 3A). As seen in other steroid receptor LBDs, the C-terminal extension of MR interacts with helix 10 via hydrogen bonds between Asp929 and the amide nitrogens of Phe981 and His982. The most unusual feature of the structure is that the residues N-terminal to helix 1 (727-737) form a short helix that associates near the coactivator groove of a crystallographically related molecule (not shown). This N-terminal feature is present in all MR complexes. In general, MR makes interactions with aldosterone in a manner consistent with how other steroid receptors bind their natural ligands (Fig. 3, B and C). There is an extensive hydrogen bond network involving the A-ring ketone of aldosterone, Gln776 and Arg817 of MR, and several water molecules that firmly lock the A-ring of the steroid in place. Specific to MR, there is a water-mediated hydrogen bond between Gln776 and Ser810. AR, GR, and PR have a methionine at this position so this interaction is not possible. Adjacent to the D-ring, the C-18 hydroxyl makes a hydrogen bond to the side chain carbonyl of Asn770 on helix 3. Asn770 is in position to coordinate a triplet of hydrogen bonds: one between the side chain carbonyl and the C-18 OH of the ligand, and two from the side chain nitrogen to the C-21 OH of the ligand and the backbone carbonyl of Glu955, a residue that lies on a loop preceding the AF-2 helix. The ligand is stabilized further by a pair of hydrogen bonds between the aldosterone C-21 hydroxyl, C-20 ketone, and Thr945 located on helix 10. This threonine is conserved in GR and PR but is replaced by leucine in AR. It is clear from the crystal structure that the orientation of Thr945 is ideal for hydrogen bonding with steroids containing C-20 carbonyls and C-21 hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3, B and C). In the MR·DOC structure (not shown), only a single hydrogen bond between Asn770 and the C-21 OH exists. Additionally, Thr945 on helix 10 maintains a pair of hydrogen bonds to the C-20 ketone and C-21 OH of the steroid. Unique to aldosterone however, Cys942 appears in position to interact with the C-18 OH. This residue lies on helix 10 and thus provides aldosterone with three possible interactions with this helix. In addition to Asn770, Ser767 is in position to make a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Glu955 in the loop preceding the AF-2. This observation suggests that both of the helix 3 residues (Asn770 and Ser767) play a role in stabilization and activation of MR. Amino acid alignments of the receptors show that an asparagine is conserved in a similar position in all of the oxosteroid receptors, suggesting that the interaction between helix 3 and the loop preceding the AF-2 may be a conserved mechanism of steroid receptor activation. MR Interactions with Progesterone—Like DOC, progesterone has no substituents off the C-11 position of the steroid. However, DOC is a potent MR agonist, whereas progesterone has been characterized as a poor activator of MR (11Rupprecht R. Reul J.M. van Steensel B. Spengler D. Soder M. Berning B. Holsboer F. Damm K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 247: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Using the MR C808S mutant to obtain the structure of the progesterone complex, the structural basis for decreased activation of MR by this ligand was examined. Although the MR-progesterone complex crystallized in a different space group (P212121) compared with bound agonists (C2221), the two space groups are related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, and nearly identical unit cell parameters suggest that the two crystal forms are related. Not surprisingly, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the MR-progesterone complex are both similar to each other, and the MR·DOC complex. Comparison of the MR·DOC and MR-progesterone complexes shows that both the overall protein fold and residue conformations around the binding pocket are generally similar. There are differences, however, between the MR·DOC and MR-progesterone complexes in the interaction of the protein with the D-ring substituents of the steroids (Fig. 3D). First, Asn770 makes no contact with progesterone. Second, the hydrogen bonding pattern to Thr945 is different. Instead of two hydrogen bonds between the ligand and Thr945 as seen with aldosterone and DOC, only a single hydrogen bond is formed with progesterone. Additionally, multiple orientations were observed for the Thr945 side chain, suggesting that the intermolecular hydrogen bond to progesterone is in competition with intramolecular hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyls of Phe941 and Cys942. This competition is not visible in either the aldosterone or DOC structures. It is also apparent from the MR-progesterone structure that both Asn770 and Ser767 are in the same location observed in MR-aldosterone structure. Although these residues may be critical for maintaining receptor conformation and activation, they are clearly not the only factors necessary for MR activation. Mutagenesis Analysis of Asn770 in MR—Previous mutagenesis studies with MR have shown the importance of Asn770 in receptor activation (29Hellal-Levy C. Fagart J. Souque A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1250-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, only a couple of mutations were examined in these studies. The dual interaction of Asn770 with both the ligand and the loop preceding the AF-2 observed in the MR-aldosterone and MR·DOC crystal structures prompted a more thorough analysis of this residue. Using transient transfection studies and a ligand concentration of 1 μm, we analyzed MR activation in CV-1 cells induced by the C-21 hydroxylated steroids aldosterone, DOC, and cortisol. MR activation induced by spironolactone and the C-21 methyl steroids progesterone and 11-OH-P was also determined. As expected, aldosterone, DOC, and cortisol showed potent activation of wtMR, whereas progesterone elicited a maximal response only ∼20% of the level achieved with aldosterone (Fig. 4). The progesterone derivative 11-OH-P, which differs from progesterone by the addition of a hydroxyl group at C-11, activated wtMR to ∼80% of the level achieved with aldosterone. Spironolactone failed to induce any appreciable MR activation at the 1 μm concentration. The mutations N770A, N770Q, N770S, N770D, N770T, and N770H all resulted in a reduction of activation to less than 5% of wt values with aldosterone, cortisol, DOC, or 11-OH-P (data not shown), whereas progesterone-induced activation was reduced to a lesser extent. Interestingly, the N770L mutant was activated by DOC to ∼40% of wt levels, whereas progesterone-induced activation was unaffected (Fig. 4). These results suggest that a hydrophobic interaction between helix 3 and the loop preceding the AF-2 serves as a substitute for the hydrogen bonding normally observed with Asn770. The results also imply that any C-11 substituent on the steroid interferes with this new interaction. These results confirm the importance of Asn770 in the activation of MR and strengthen the assertion that interaction between helix 3 and the loop preceding the AF-2 is required for MR activation. Although it is possible that mutational analysis at this position could result in a receptor incapable of binding ligands, the N770A mutant has been shown to bind progesterone (but not aldosterone or cortisol) with nearly the same affinity as wtMR (29Hellal-Levy C. Fagart J. Souque A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1250-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mutational Analysis of Thr945 in MR—In the crystal structures, Thr945/ligand interactions appeared to distinguish potent agonists from the decreased activity observed with progesterone. To test the requirement for ligand/helix 10 interactions, the effects of mutating Thr945 on the activation of MR with both C-21-OH- and C-21-methyl-containing steroids were examined (Fig. 4). Aldosterone activation of the T945A mutant was equivalent to that of wtMR, whereas DOC and cortisol activation was less than 40% of the aldosterone-induced level. Progesterone and 11-OH-P activation was reduced to ∼10 and 50%, respectively, of the aldosterone maximum. Spironolactone failed to induce any activation of this mutant. An interaction of the ligand with the Thr945 side chain is clearly important for receptor activation. The crystal structure of MR bound to progesterone suggests a molecular competition with respect to the orientation of Thr945. The interaction of progesterone with this residue fluctuates between a hydrogen bond with the C-20 carbonyl and the Thr945 hydroxyl, and a hydrophobic interaction between the C-21 methyl of the steroid and the Thr945 methyl. If this bifurcation occurs, mutation of Thr945 to a valine would remove the intramolecular hydrogen bond an"

To further understand how P-TEFb is regulated, we analyzed the stoichiometry of all the known components of the large, inactive P-TEFb complex. Mutational analyses of a putative coiled coil region in the carboxyl-terminal portion of HEXIM1 revealed that the protein is a dimer in solution and remains a dimer after binding to 7SK. Although a HEXIM1 dimer contains two potential RNA binding motifs and ultimately recruits two P-TEFb molecules, it associates with only one molecule of RNA. The first 172 nucleotides of the 330-nucleotide 7SK are sufficient to bind HEXIM1 or HEXIM2, and then recruit and inhibit P-TEFb. Deletion of the first 121 amino acids of HEXIM1 allowed it to inhibit P-TEFb partially in the absence of 7SK RNA. Mutation of a conserved tyrosine (Tyr271 in HEXIM1) to alanine or glutamate or mutation of a conserved phenylalanine (Phe208) to alanine, aspartate, or lysine, resulted in loss of inhibition of P-TEFb, but did not affect formation of the 7SK·HEXIM·P-TEFb complex. Analysis of T-loop phosphorylation in Cdk9 indicated that phosphorylation of Thr186, but not Ser175, was essential for kinase activity and for recruitment of P-TEFb to the 7SK·HEXIM complex.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, Cyclin-dependent kinases; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; MS, mass spectrometry. are key regulators of a variety of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, transcription, and neuronal differentiation. The kinase activity of Cdks in turn is tightly regulated. Association with a cyclin partner and phosphorylation of the T-loop is needed for activation of Cdks. They are also subject to negative regulation via phosphorylation or through interaction with a family of Cdk inhibitory proteins (1.Harper J.W. Adams P.D. Chem.

When cells are treated with P-TEFb inhibitors, such as 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole, or other agents that block transcription elongation, the large form is converted into the small active form (21.Michels A.A.

This form of P-TEFb regulation is physiologically significant, because it has been shown that all signals that trigger cardiac hypertrophy converge at the critical step of activating P-TEFb through dissociation of 7SK and HEXIM. This activation causes increased cellular transcription, and an increase in the size of cardiomyocytes (25.Sano M. Abdellatif M. Oh H. Xie M. Bagella L. Giordano A. Michael L.H. DeMayo F.J.

Two regions of HEXIM1 have been characterized. The region centered upon KHRR (amino acids 152-155) is involved in binding of 7SK, and contains nuclear localization signals (21.Michels A.A.

In addition, regions involved in interactions have been narrowed down to amino acids 1-254 of 726 of cyclin T1, all of Cdk9, and nucleotide 1-175 of 7SK (19.Nguyen V.T. Kiss T. Michels A.A.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of the T-loop of Cdk9 has been implicated in activation of P-TEFb, and is required for the formation of the 7SK·HEXIM1·P-TEFb complex (30.Chen R. Yang Z. Zhou Q. J. Biol.

We identified residues critical for inhibition of the kinase activity of P-TEFb, and formation of the 7SK·HEXIM1·P-TEFb complex. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how P-TEFb kinase activity is controlled by 7SK RNA and HEXIM proteins.

PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with Pfu Ultra HF DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Baculoviruses expressing human cyclin T1, wild type and mutant Cdk9s, as described under “Results, ” were generated using the BaculoDirect Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purification of wild type and mutant P-TEFb was carried out as previously described (23.Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). For the co-expression experiment, FLAG-tagged, wild type HEXIM1 was cloned into pACYCDuet-1 vector (Novagen), and His-tagged ΔN was cloned into pET21a (Novagen). Glycerol Gradient Analysis—HeLaS3 cells, at 90% confluence in a T-75 flask, were transfected with pFLAG-CMV2-HEXIM1-2LR plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 6 h the transfection media was removed, and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard conditions for 48 h. Cells were scraped, spun down at 2,000 rpm, and then lysed for 15 min on ice in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm prior to fractionation on 5-ml 5-45% glycerol gradients in the same buffer conditions used during lysis, except that Nonidet P-40 was omitted. Gradients were run at 45,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW-Ti55 rotor before being fractionated. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-Cdk9 (provided by Dr. Zhou, University of California at Berkeley) or transiently transfected with pFLAG-CMV2-HEXIM1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum under standard conditions (37 °C in 5% CO2). Cell lysates and glycerol gradient analyses were performed as described above. Gradient fractions 4 and 9 (out of 16 fractions) were incubated with EZview™ Red ANTI-FLAG® M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were washed 3 times with 10 bead volumes of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% Tween 20 prior to suspension in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Western blotting was carried out as previously described (23.Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) and Native Gel Analysis—12-μl Reactions were carried out in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 300 ng of poly(I)-poly(C) (Amersham Biosciences), and included 500 pg of radiolabeled 7SK RNA, recombinant P-TEFb comprised of Cdk9 and cyclin T1, and recombinant HEXIM1 or HEXIM2 as indicated. 7SK and poly(rI)-poly(rC) were heated individually for 5 min at 75 °C and cooled on ice for another 5 min, prior to addition. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and resolved on a 3.5% polyacrylamide (19 to 1, acrylamide: bisacrylamide ratio) gel in 0.5× Tris glycine at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 6 watts. The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography. For native gel analysis, the indicated HEXIM1 proteins in 60 mm HGKEDP were resolved on a 6% gel in 0.5× Tris glycine at 4 °C for 2 h at 6 watts. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Kinase Assay—16-μl Kinase reactions containing purified recombinant wild type or mutant P-TEFb with Drosophila RNA polymerase II or human DSIF as the substrate were carried out in 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 7 mm MgCl2, 30 μm ATP, 1.3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin per reaction, and the indicated amounts of wild type or mutant HEXIM1 proteins. T7-transcribed 7SK RNA was added last to the preincubation after it was heated for 5 min at 75 °C and then cooled on ice for another 5 min. All reactions were incubated for 10 min at 23 °C prior to the addition of ATP. The kinase reactions were then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and then stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Reactions were resolved by 9% SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was subjected to autoradiography and quantified with a Packard InstantImager. Identification of Cdk9 Phosphorylation Sites by Mass Spectrometry—Recombinant P-TEFb (His-Cdk9/cyclin T1, ∼2 μg) was purified using Ni-NTA resin, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. The Cdk9-containing band was excised from the gel and split into two pieces, one of which was fully trypsinized as described (31.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), and the other was incubated with trypsin for only 1 h at room temperature to allow partial digestion. The tryptic peptides were extracted and analyzed as previously reported (32.Peng J. Gygi S.P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) using an LCQ-DECA XP-Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). HEXIM1 Is a Dimer—Sequence alignment of HEXIM1 and HEXIM2 proteins from different species revealed a relatively conserved region at their COOH termini, containing several invariant leucine residues (23.Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar). When this region of human HEXIM1 (amino acids 284-318) was plotted on a helical wheel, a pattern of leucine residues characteristic of a leucine zipper coiled coil motif emerges (Fig. 1A). Because this motif is frequently involved in protein-protein interactions, we first examined if HEXIM1 could oligomerize via this region. Two proteins containing single mutations with either leucine 287 or 294 substituted with arginine (L287R, L294R), and a double mutant with both Leu287 and Leu294 replaced by arginine (2LR) were produced. All three mutant proteins had relatively similar mobility compared with wild type HEXIM1 when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). However, when analyzed on a native gel, L287R and 2LR had higher mobility than wild type and L294R (Fig. 1C). It is unlikely that the differences are because of the small fractional changes in charge. This is supported by two observations. Wild type and L294R have similar mobilities, but different charge, and L287R and L294R have the same charge, but different mobilities. It is likely that the differences in mobility are because of the disruption of oligomerization in the L287R and 2LR mutants. To confirm the hypothesis that the carboxyl-terminal domain allowed oligomerization, two truncation mutants were generated. A control protein, ΔN, lacked the amino-terminal 120 amino acids, whereas ΔC, lacked the carboxyl-terminal 77 amino acids that contained the entire leucine zipper motif (Fig. 1A). ΔN had much higher mobility than ΔC on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1B). In contrast, this difference in mobility was reversed on the native gel (Fig. 1C), strongly suggesting the leucine zipper motif mediates oligomerization of HEXIM1. The function of these mutants was compared with wild type HEXIM1 using a mobility shift assay and a kinase assay. HEXIM1 formed the expected complex with 7SK that was further shifted by association with P-TEFb (Fig. 1D). The ΔC mutant, assayed at two concentrations, formed a complex with double the mobility of the wild type HEXIM1 complex, but was still able to recruit P-TEFb. Because ΔC cannot dimerize, we assume that the predominate shift seen at the highest concentration contains a HEXIM1 monomer. The less severe mutant, 2LR, formed a 7SK complex with slightly lower mobility than ΔC, and at a higher concentration also formed a complex with mobility similar to the wild type complex (Fig. 1D). Evidently, it binds as a monomer at low concentration, but can dimerize at higher concentrations. The 2LR dimer may be stabilized by interactions with 7SK. Both 2LR·7SK complexes were able to recruit P-TEFb (Fig. 1D). The effects of the HEXIM1 proteins on the kinase activity of P-TEFb were assayed in the absence and presence of 7SK. As expected, without 7SK the wild type and leucine zipper mutants had no effect on P-TEFb kinase activity (Fig. 1E). Supporting an idea stated earlier that removing the amino-terminal region might unmask P-TEFb binding or inhibitory regions of HEXIM1 (29.Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), ΔN inhibited P-TEFb activity down to 40% without 7SK. In the presence of 7SK all proteins inhibited P-TEFb, but the inhibition by proteins with reduced oligomerization (L287R, 2LR, and ΔC) was less robust (Fig. 1E). The ability of ΔN to inhibit P-TEFb was further stimulated by 7SK. Evidently the unmasking of the inhibitory regions by deletion of the first 120 amino acids is not complete, and is further stimulated by binding of 7SK. Evidence that HEXIM1 is a dimer came from a co-expression experiment. A FLAG-tagged, wild type HEXIM1 and a His-tagged ΔN were co-expressed in E. coli using two different plasmids with compatible replication origins (Fig. 2A). Cell lysates were first subjected to Ni-NTA chromatography and FLAG-tagged wild type HEXIM1 co-eluted with His-tagged ΔN, demonstrating that the two HEXIM1 proteins could stably interact (Fig. 2B). The material that eluted from the Ni-NTA column was further purified by FLAG affinity chromatography. Again, His-tagged ΔN and FLAG-tagged wild type HEXIM1 co-eluted. Unlike the material that eluted from the Ni column, which contained more His-tagged protein than FLAG-tagged protein, equal amounts of each protein eluted from the FLAG antibody column (Fig. 2B). This 1 to 1 ratio indicated that HEXIM1 was at least a dimer. Because similar results would have been obtained if HEXIM1 formed a trimer, tetramer, or higher order oligomer, the oligomerization state was determined by comparing the mobilities of the two homo-oligomers with the hetero-oligomer on a native gel. If HEXIM1 dimerizes, then only one band with intermediate mobility should be given by the hetero-oligomer. IF HEXIM1 trimerizes, then two bands with intermediate mobility should be seen (one with 2 large and 1 small protein and one with 2 small and one large protein). Silver staining of the native gel demonstrated that the hetero-oligomer gave only one band of intermediate mobility between the two homo-oligomers, clearly indicating that HEXIM1 forms dimers (Fig. 2C). To determine whether HEXIM1 binds to 7SK as a dimer, the same logic was applied to the results of a mobility shift assay. The mobility of 7SK complex with the heterodimer gave a single band that was intermediate between the two homodimers (Fig. 2D). In addition, all three complexes were able to recruit P-TEFb (Fig. 2D). Therefore, HEXIM1 maintains its dimerization state during association with 7SK and P-TEFb. Oligomerization of HEXIM1 was also analyzed in vivo using HeLa cells transfected with FLAG-tagged HEXIM1 expressing constructs. Lysates from cells expressing FLAG-tagged wild type HEXIM1 were subjected to glycerol gradient sedimentation and fractionation to separate free HEXIM1 from HEXIM1 in the 7SK·HEXIM1·P-TEFb complex. Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with anti-FLAG antibodies using fraction 4 containing free HEXIM1 or fraction 9 containing HEXIM1 in the large complex. Using anti-FLAG antibodies, endogenous HEXIM1 protein co-precipitated with the FLAG HEXIM1 from both fractions (Fig. 3A). Thus we conclude that HEXIM1 oligomerizes regardless of its association with 7SK and P-TEFb in vivo. Cdk9 was present in both fractions, but, as expected, it only immunoprecipitated using FLAG antibodies with HEXIM1 in fraction 9 containing the large P-TEFb complex. HeLa cells were also transfected with a plasmid containing the FLAG-tagged 2LR mutant, and the cell lysate analyzed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. The distribution of FLAG-tagged 2LR mutant was predominantly in fractions 1-3, in contrast to the distribution of the endogenous HEXIM1, which was fractions 2-4 (Fig. 3B). The difference in sedimentation likely reflects the loss of oligomerization by the 2LR mutant. Although we have not rigorously proven that HEXIM1 is a dimer, rather than a trimer or higher oligomer in vivo, the sedimentation of wild type free HEXIM1 (40 kDa) is consistent with it being a dimer (80 kDa) because it sediments slower than free P-TEFb (120 kDa). A similar immunoprecipitation experiment was carried out on cells expressing FLAG-tagged Cdk9. Anti-FLAG antibodies brought down only FLAG-tagged Cdk9 from a glycerol gradient fraction containing the free form of P-TEFb (Fig. 3C). However, FLAG-tagged Cdk9 and untagged, endogenous Cdk9, as well as HEXIM1, were pulled down from a fraction containing the large form of P-TEFb (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that free P-TEFb does not dimerize in the cell, but that the large complex contains two P-TEFb molecules. The 7SK·HEXIM·P-TEFb Complex Contains One 7SK Molecule—We examined the stoichiometry of 7SK in complexes formed with HEXIM proteins. A 330-nucleotide full-length 7SK and a truncated RNA containing the first 172 nucleotides of 7SK were synthesized by in vitro transcription. The abilities of the full-length and truncated 7SK to support HEXIM1-mediated inhibition of P-TEFb in vitro were analyzed. Neither RNA inhibited P-TEFb alone, but when mixed with equal molar amounts of HEXIM1 both RNAs produced a dose-dependent inhibition down to about 10% (Fig. 4A). Evidently, only the first half of 7SK is needed for a functional interaction with HEXIM1 and P-TEFb. Both RNAs were able to form complexes with HEXIM1 and subsequently recruit P-TEFb (Fig. 4B). To determine whether more than one 7SK would bind to a HEXIM1 dimer, the two versions of 7SK were mixed together before adding HEXIM1 and then analyzed by EMSA. The shifts that were generated were identical to the shifts seen with the individual RNAs (Fig. 4B). Identical results were obtained when HEXIM1 was replaced by a functionally similar protein, HEXIM2 (23.Byers S.A. Price J.P. Cooper J.J. Li Q. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Because there was no detectable intermediate complex we conclude that there is only one 7SK in the complex. Tyrosine 271 and Phenylalanine 208 of HEXIM1 Are Critical for Inhibition of P-TEFb Kinase Activity—The sequence alignment of HEXIM proteins across many species revealed five invariant tyrosine residues corresponding to amino acids 167, 203, 271, 274, and 291 of human HEXIM1. Previously, we showed that Tyr203 is located in the region of HEXIM1 important for the recruitment of P-TEFb to the 7SK·HEXIM1 complex (29.Michels A.A. Fraldi A. Li Q. Adamson T.E. Bonnet F. Nguyen V.T. Sedore S.C. Price J.P. Price D.H. Lania L. Bensaude O. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2608-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To examine potential roles of the other tyrosines, mutant HEXIM1 proteins containing Y167E, Y271E, Y274E, or Y291E were generated and tested for their ability to inhibit P-TEFb kinase activity in the presence of 7SK. Only Y271E lost most of its inhibitory properties (data not shown). To examine the role of Tyr271 in detail, Y271A and Y271F mutants were also generated, and the abilities of the three mutants to inhibit P-TEFb in the presence of 7SK were compared with wild type HEXIM1. Y271A and Y271E did not support robust inhibition of P-TEFb, but Y271F behaved the same as the wild type (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, all four proteins were able to form complexes with 7SK and recruit P-TEFb (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that it is critical for inhibition of P-TEFb to maintain an aromatic residue at position 271, but that this residue is not essential for the recruitment of P-TEFb to the 7SK·HEXIM1 complex. A similar analysis of a conserved phenylalanine, Phe208, was carried out. F208A, F208D, and F208K mutants were generated, and the purified proteins were used in a kinase assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine their ability to inhibit P-TEFb and to recruit P-TEFb to a 7SK·HEXIM1 complex. All three mutants displayed a significantly reduced ability to inhibit P-TEFb in the presence of 7SK, but all mutants, except F208K, maintained their ability to recruit P-TEFb to the 7SK·HEXIM1 complex (Fig. 5, C and D). We conclude that both Tyr271 and Phe208 are critical for inhibition of P-TEFb, but have only a minimal influence on the ability of HEXIM1 to associate with P-TEFb. Phosphorylation of Threonine 186 of Cdk9 Is Required for P-TEFb Kinase Activity and Formation of the 7SK·HEXIM1·P-TEFb Complex—To examine the role of phosphorylation of the T-loop of Cdk9, recombinant P-TEFb proteins containing cyclin T1 and wild type, S175A, S175D, T186A, or T186E mutations in Cdk9 were purified individually (Fig. 6A). Because Cdk9, but not cyclin T1 was His-tagged, and equal molar amounts of Cdk9 and cyclin T1 were purified, none of the mutations had an effect on association of the cyclin. Increasing amounts of each purified protein were subjected to a direct kina"

When primer extension was done in the presence of a mixture of all four dNTPs, high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the products indicated that (opposite 3′-(1,N2-ϵ-G)CACT-5′) the major product was 5′-GTGA-3′ and the minor product was 5′-AGTGA-3′. With the template 3′-(1,N2-ϵ-G)TACT-5′, the following four products were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry: 5′-AATGA-3′, 5′-ATTGA-3′, 5′-ATGA-3′, and 5′-TGA-3′. An x-ray crystal structure of Dpo4 was solved (2.1 Å) with a primer-template and A placed in the primer to be opposite the 1,N2-ϵ-G in the template 3′-(1,N2-ϵ-G)TACT 5′. The added A in the primer was paired across the template T with classic Watson-Crick geometry. Similar structures were observed in a ternary Dpo4-DNA-dATP complex and a ternary Dpo4-DNA-ddATP complex, with d(d)ATP opposite the template T. A similar structure was observed with a ddGTP adjacent to the primer and opposite the C next to 1,N2-ϵ-G in 3′-(1,N2-ϵ-G)CACT-5′. We concluded that Dpo4 uses several mechanisms, including A incorporation opposite 1,N2-ϵ-G and also a variation of dNTP-stabilized misalignment, to generate both base pair and frameshift mutations. 1,N2-Etheno(ϵ)guanine is a mutagenic DNA lesion derived from lipid oxidation products and also from some chemical carcinogens.

The accurate replication of DNA is important in the maintenance of the genetic integrity of an organism, and DNA polymerases have biochemical mechanisms to copy with very high fidelity (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). DNA is constantly subject to damage by physical and chemical agents, including compounds produced endogenously and those derived from the environment (3Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens. 1 and 2. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984Google Scholar). More than 130 human proteins are involved in the repair of DNA damage (4Christmann M. Tomicic M.T. Roos W.P. Kaina B. Toxicology. 2003; 193: 3-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, some damage escapes these surveillance systems, and DNA polymerases are forced to encounter multiple types of damaged DNA. The polymerases can be blocked, leading to cell cycle arrest or death, or can proceed to copy past the modified DNA. Copying past a DNA adduct raises the prospect of mutation. Mutation is a significant factor in the carcinogenicity of chemicals, and mutagens are generally regarded as cancer suspects (5Ames B.N. Durston W.E. Yamasaki E. Lee F.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, many mutagens were known to be most effective in bacteria when the SOS response system was activated (19Walker G.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 60-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

A number of questions still exist about the interactions of 1,N2-ϵ-G with DNA polymerases, in that different misincorporations and frameshifts have been observed with individual polymerases, and in some cases undefined mixtures of products are obtained with a single polymerase (15Langouët S.

The availability of Dpo4 provided opportunities to study the incorporation of dNTPs in a simple system and to obtain structures of crystals of ternary complexes (of the polymerase, primer-template complex, and dNTP). We report a series of steady-state kinetic and other primer-template studies with Dpo4 and 1,N2-ϵ-G in two template sequences. LC-MS/MS methods were used to define the products and provide insight into the multiple bypass mechanisms Dpo4 can use. Four crystal structures of Dpo4:1,N2-ϵ-G oligonucleotide complexes provide direct visualization of some of the intermediates, particularly the -1 frameshift mechanism. This latter intermediate has normal hydrogen bonding to the base 5′ of the 1,N2-ϵ-G but no distortion of the adducted oligonucleotide. Materials—Escherichia coli UDG was purchased from Sigma. pol T7- (exonuclease-) was expressed in E. coli and purified as described elsewhere (37Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

Unmodified oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). Oligonucleotides containing 1,N2-ϵ-G were prepared in the Vanderbilt facility from a phosphoramidite derivative of 1,N2-ϵ-G, using a modification of procedures described previously (15Langouët S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6069-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Isolation of S. solfataricus P2 DNA Polymerase IV (Dpo4) Gene and Construction of Dpo4 Expression Plasmid—The dpo4 gene was obtained by PCR amplification from the genomic DNA of S. solfataricus P2 (American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA; catalog number ATCC 35092) as template using Pfu ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with two primers, 5′-CATATGCATCACCATCACCATCACATGATTGTTCTTTTCGTTG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTAAGTATCGAAGAACTTG-3′. The resulting 1.1-kb Dpo4 gene PCR product was cloned into the vector pPCR-Script Amp (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the nucleotide sequence was determined (Vanderbilt facility) to confirm the coding region. The 1.1-kb Dpo4 gene fragment was then cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI), generating the vector pET22b(+)/DPO4-NHis. Expression and Purification of Dpo4-–Dpo4 fused to an N-terminal His6 tag was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the pET22b(+)/DPO4-NHis vector (6 liters) was grown in Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg ml-1) at 37 °C, with aeration, to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and the incubation was continued for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 60 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg of lysozyme ml-1, and protease inhibitor mixture) (Roche Applied Science), cooled on ice for 30 min, and then lysed by sonication (12 × 10 s duration with a Branson digital sonifier (VWR, West Chester, PA), microtip, 45% amplitude, with intervening cooling time). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 × 104× g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was heated at 80 °C for 10 min and centrifuged to remove the denatured proteins; the soluble and heat-stable proteins were collected (including Dpo4). The soluble supernatant was applied to a 5-ml HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) and washed sequentially with 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 20 mm imidazole, 50 ml of buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, and 50 ml of buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 50–400 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins (detected at 280 nm) were dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoS column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl to remove the contaminating proteins, and the protein was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl in buffer C. The eluted fractions (280 nm absorbance) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (40Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Dpo4 was eluted at 200 mm NaCl. By using this protocol, Dpo4 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, based on staining (see Supplemental Material). Protein concentration was determined using a calculated ϵ280 value of 22 mm-1 cm-1 for Dpo4 (41Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3372) Google Scholar). The final yield of purified Dpo4 was ∼10 mg. Polymerization Assays and Gel Electrophoresis—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of single dNTPs (Scheme 1). Each reaction was initiated by adding 2 μl of dNTP-Mg2+ solution (final concentrations of 250 μm of each dNTP and 5 mm MgCl2) to a preincubated E·DNA complex (final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 nm DNA duplex, 100 nm Dpo4 or pol T7-, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg of BSA ml-1, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol (v/v)) 2In some cases, alternative conditions were used, with 50 mm sodium MOPS (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 100 μm dNTP (no BSA), and similar results were obtained. at 37 °C, yielding a total reaction volume of 8 μl. When pol T7- was used, E. coli thioredoxin was added in a 20-fold molar excess of pol T7-. After 30 min, reactions were quenched with 50 μl of 20 mm EDTA (pH 9.0) in 95% formamide (v/v). Aliquots (3 μl) were separated by electrophoresis on a denaturing gel containing 8.0 m urea and 16% acrylamide (w/v) (from a 19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide solution, AccuGel, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) with 80 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA. The gel was exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Imaging Screen K, Bio-Rad) overnight. The bands (representing extension of the primer) were visualized with a PhosphorImaging system (Bio-Rad, Molecular Imager® FX) using the manufacturer's Quantity One software, version 4.3.0. Steady-state Kinetics—Unless indicated otherwise, all Dpo4 reactions were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg of BSA ml-1.2 For unmodified templates, the molar ratio of primer-template to enzyme was 40:1, and the reactions were done at eight dNTP concentrations (reaction time of 3 min). For modified templates, the molar ratio of primer-template to enzyme was usually 10:1, and reactions were done at eight dNTP concentrations (reaction time of 5 min). LC-MS Analysis of Oligonucleotide Products from Dpo4 Reactions— Dpo4 reactions were performed at 37 °C for 6 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 5% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg of BSA ml-1. The reactions were done with 10 μm oligonucleotide substrate, 5 μm Dpo4, and four dNTPs at 1 mm each, in a final reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was terminated by extraction of excess dNTPs using a spin column (Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column, Bio-Rad). To the above filtrate (120 μl), concentrated Tris-HCl, DTT, and EDTA were added to restore the initial concentrations, and UDG solution was added (20 units). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h to hydrolyze the uracil residues on the primer. The final reaction mixture was heated at 95 °C for 1 h in the presence of 0.25 m piperidine, followed by lyophilization. The dried residues were dissolved in 100 μl of H2O for the following MS analysis. MS was performed on a DecaXP ion trap instrument (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Separation of oligonucleotide was carried out with a Jupiter microbore column (1.0 mm × 150 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Buffer A contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2, pH 6.8, and 2% CH3CN (v/v); buffer B contained 10 mm NH4CH3CO2, pH 6.8, and 95% CH3CN (v/v). The following gradient program was used with a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1: 0–2 min, hold at 100% A; 2–20 min, linear program to 100% B; 20–30 min, hold at 100% B; 30–31 min, linear program to 100% A; 31–40 min, hold at 100% A (for next injection). The desired oligonucleotide products were eluted at ∼ 7 min. A pre-column “Tee” set-up was applied, with only 10% of the total flow infused to the ion source. The fast flow rate helped reduce the equilibration time of the column, and thus retention time of the oligonucleotides was consistent between runs. Samples were infused using an autosampler, with 8 μl withdrawn from a 50-μl reaction. ES conditions were as follows: source voltage 3.4 kV, source current 8.5 μA, sheath gas flow rate setting 28.2, auxiliary sweep gas flow rate setting 4.3, capillary voltage 49 V, capillary temperature 230 °C, tube lens voltage 67 V. MS/MS conditions were as follows: normalized collision energy 35%, activation Q 0.250, time 30 min, 1 scan. Product ion spectra were acquired over the range m/z 250–2000. The abundant ions from LC-MS spectra were selected for CID analysis, and the cut-off was set above ∼15% of the most abundant ion. When more than one ion came from a single species, the peak responding to the doubly charged parent ion was chosen for fragmentation. The calculations of the CID fragmentations of a certain oligonucleotide sequence were done using a program linked to the Mass Spectrometry Group of Medicinal Chemistry at the University of Utah (medlib.med.utah.edu/masspec/). Crystallization of Dpo4-DNA Complexes—Primer and template sequences that were used in the crystallizations were similar to those utilized by Yang and co-workers (32Ling H. Boudsocq F. Plosky B.S.

Annealed template 1 and 14-mer primer were used to make the binary complex with Dpo4 (Dpo4-1). Ternary complexes were prepared by annealing either template 1 (Dpo4-2 and Dpo4-3) or template 2 (Dpo4-4) and 13-mer primer, mixing the DNA with Dpo4, and adding either dATP and Ca2+ (Dpo4-2), ddATP and Mg2+ (Dpo4-3), or ddGTP and Ca2+ (Dpo4-4). Polymerase and the DNA duplex were mixed in a 1:1.2 molar ratio and incubated in 1 mm dATP, ddATP, or ddGTP in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (ddATP), or CaCl2 (dATP and ddGTP), 1.0 mm tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 2.5% glycerol (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature. The final protein concentration was kept at 5 mg ml-1. Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. The well solution contained 10% polyethylene glycol 3350, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm Ca(CH3CO2)2. Crystals were transferred to mother liquor containing 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 (w/v) and 15% ethylene glycol (v/v) and were swiped through paratone-N before being flash-frozen in liquid N2.Table IVCID fragments of 5′-pTCGTGA-3′nChargea-Bwyd-H2O1–1330.059aBoldface numbers refer to the peaks found in the CID spectrum in Fig. 5B250.093303.037–22–1481.040659.111579.145592.083–2240.016329.051289.068295.538–3196.6893–1770.086963.157883.191921.136–2384.539481.074441.091460.064–3256.023320.380293.725306.373–4229.5284–11099.1381292.2091212.2431225.181–2549.065645.600605.617612.086–3365.707430.064403.409407.722–4274.028322.296302.305305.539–5244.2305–11403.1831581.2551501.2891554.233–2701.088790.123750.140776.613–3467.056526.413499.757517.406–4350.040394.558374.566387.802–5279.830315.444299.451310.040–6258.199a Boldface numbers refer to the peaks found in the CID spectrum in Fig. 5B Open table in a new tab X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data sets for crystals of the Dpo4-1, -2, and -3 complexes were collected at a wavelength of 0.99 Å on the ID-22 SER-CAT beam line at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). Data for the Dpo4-4 complex crystal were collected at a wavelength of 0.92 Å on the ID-5 DND-CAT beam line at the Advanced Photon Source. The resolutions for the data of the Dpo4-1, -2, -3, and -4 complexes were 2.0, 2.37, 2.5, and 2.17 Å, respectively (Table I).

https://openalex.org/W2083251817,"Eukaryotic cells are equipped with machinery to monitor and repair damaged DNA. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA replication occurs at discrete sites in nuclei, the replication compartment, where viral replication proteins cluster and synthesize a large amount of viral DNA. In the present study, HSV infection was found to elicit a cellular DNA damage response, with activation of the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signal transduction pathway, as observed by autophosphorylation of ATM and phosphorylation of multiple downstream targets including Nbs1, Chk2, and p53, while infection with a UV-inactivated virus or with a replication-defective virus did not. Activated ATM and the DNA damage sensor MRN complex composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 were recruited and retained at sites of viral DNA replication, probably recognizing newly synthesized viral DNAs as abnormal DNA structures. These events were not observed in ATM-deficient cells, indicating ATM dependence. In Nbs1-deficient cells, HSV infection induced an ATM DNA damage response that was delayed, suggesting a functional MRN complex requirement for efficient ATM activation. However, ATM silencing had no effect on viral replication in 293T cells. Our data open up an interesting question of how the virus is able to complete its replication, although host cells activate ATM checkpoint signaling in response to the HSV infection.

Our data open up an interesting question of how the virus is able to complete its replication, although host cells activate ATM checkpoint signaling in response to the HSV infection. Upon DNA damage, eukaryotic cells exhibit a variety of physiological responses, including cell cycle arrest, activation of DNA repair, and apoptosis. Sets of checkpoint proteins that have been conserved with evolution are rapidly induced to prevent replication or segregation of damaged DNA before repair is completed. Related phosphatidylinositol 3-like kinases, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia telangiectacia-mutated; ATR, ATM-Rad3-related; DSB, DNA double strand breaks; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; HFF, human foreskin fibroblast; HSV, herpes simplex virus; hTERT, human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene; HU, hydroxyurea; IR, ionizing radiation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MRN, complex composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; ACV, acyclovir; PAA, phosphonoacetic acid; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; p.i., postinfection. and ATM-Rad3-related (ATR), respond to a variety of abnormal DNA structures and initiate signaling cascades leading to a DNA damage checkpoint (1Westphal C.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R789-R792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, ATM responds to the presence of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation (IR) (2Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ATR pathway can be stimulated by hydroxyurea (HU), UV light, and base-damaging agents that interfere with the movement of replication forks (3Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The ATR pathway also responds to DSBs but more slowly than ATM (4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

A variety of checkpoint proteins have been identified as substrates for ATM and ATR kinases, including the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2, as well as p53 (2Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev.

ATM exists as an inactive dimer in the nucleus but undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser-1981 in response to DSBs and dissociates into active monomers (1Westphal C.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R789-R792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATM phosphorylates Chk2 including Thr-68, followed by Chk2 activation (5Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Chk1 is mainly phosphorylated by ATR in response to UV and HU, leading to a 3–5-fold increase in enzyme activity (5Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) are enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses with genomes of 152 and 155 kbp, respectively (17Roizman B. Knipe D.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Fields Virology. Fourth Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2002: 2399-2459Google Scholar). Upon infection immediate-early gene products are expressed and lead to an ordered cascade of viral early and late gene expression. Viral genome is replicated by viral replication machinery, generating highly branched replication intermediates (18Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The packaging machinery then cleaves concatemeric DNA to monomeric units, which are packaged into preassembled capsids. In HSV-1, DSBs may arise as a consequence of replication fork collapse at sites of oxidative damage, which is known to be induced upon viral infection (19Valyi-Nagy T. Olson S.J. Valyi-Nagy K. Montine T.J. Dermody T.S. Virology. 2000; 278: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Milatovic D. Zhang Y. Olson S.J. Montine K.S. Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Montine T.J. Dermody T.S. Valyi-Nagy T. J. Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DSBs are also generated by cleavage of viral a sequences by endonuclease G during genome isomerization (21Huang K.J. Zemelman B.V. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21071-21079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Wohlrab F. Chatterjee S. Wells R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6432-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is of interest to determine whether host cells can monitor HSV infection as DNA damage. We show here that HSV infection elicits a cellular DNA damage response dependent on ATM. Thereby, DNA damage sensor MRN complex and phosphorylated ATM are recruited to viral replication compartments, presumably recognizing newly synthesized viral DNAs as abnormal DNA structures. Cells—Human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells and African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Skin fibroblasts from ataxia telangiectasia patients were immortalized by introduction of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene (AT1OS/T-n cells) (23Nakamura H. Fukami H. Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Nakatsugawa S. Hamaguchi M. Ishizaki K. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 2002; 43: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Skin fibroblast (NBS1129W) from a NBS patient with a homozygous 5 bp deletion in the NBS gene (gift from Dr. Komatsu, Kyoto University) were similarly immortalized by introduction of hTERT gene as described previously (23Nakamura H. Fukami H. Hayashi Y. Kiyono T. Nakatsugawa S. Hamaguchi M. Ishizaki K. J. Radiat. Res. (Tokyo). 2002; 43: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) to give NBS1129W/T-n. Immortalization of cells with the hTERT gene should not change their original characteristics. AT1OS/T-n and NBS1129W/T-n cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and G418 (200 μg/ml), while 293T cells introduced with ATM shRNA (293T-ATM shRNA) or control vector (293T-Control vector) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and hygromycin B (100 μg/ml). All human cells were used under Japanese ethical guidelines for use of human subjects. Viruses—The HSV-1 strain 17 and the HSV-2 strain 186 were propagated on Vero cells for titration. To inactivate HSV-2 by UV light, a 1-ml volume of HSV stock in a 60-mm dish was exposed to UV from a Toshiba GL-15 bulb at a dose rate of 20 × 106 J/mm2/s for 10 min. The fHSVpac bacterial artificial chromosome and pHGCX plasmid containing the enhanced GFP gene (24Saeki Y. Ichikawa T. Saeki A. Chiocca E.A. Tobler K. Ackermann M. Breakefield X.O. Fraefel C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) were kindly provided from Dr. Y. Saeki (Harvard Medical School). A replication-incompetent HSV amplicon expressing GFP was prepared by cotransfection of both bacterial artificial chromosome and plasmid DNAs into Vero2/2 cells and titrated by using 293T cells as described (24Saeki Y. Ichikawa T. Saeki A. Chiocca E.A. Tobler K. Ackermann M. Breakefield X.O. Fraefel C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Infections—Infections were performed on monolayers of cultured cells at indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). After 1 h at 37 °C, monolayers were overlaid with DMEM containing 10% FCS. Acyclovir (ACV) was used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) was used at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml (25Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Shirata N. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3409-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The drug was added with the virus and left in for the duration of infection. Antibodies—The anti-UL42 gene product-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Nishiyama, Nagoya University School of Medicine. Anti-Nbs1 and anti-Mre11 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences and anti-phospho-ATM (Ser-1981), antiphospho-Chk2 (Thr-68), anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser-317 and Ser-345), and anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-p53 (Ab-6) and anti-ATM (Ab-3) were from Oncogene. Anti-GFP antibody and highly cross-absorbed secondary reagents for dualcolor detection (Alexa 488 and 594) were from Molecular Probes. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and treated with lysis buffer (0.02% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) including a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 200 μm sodium vanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride for 20 min on ice. Equal amounts of proteins (30 μg) were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Reaction with antibodies and detection with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) were performed as described previously (26Kudoh A. Fujita M. Kiyono T. Kuzushima K. Sugaya Y. Izuta S. Nishiyama Y. Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown in culture chambers (Nunc) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then treated twice with 0.5% Triton X-100-mCSK buffer (27Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54817-54825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) on ice, followed by fixation with 70% methanol overnight at 4 °C. The fixed cells were blocked for 1 h with 10% FCS in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with individual primary monoclonal antibodies. The cells were incubated with the anti-HSV2 UL42 protein-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody for 15 min at room temperature then incubated for 1 h with secondary goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or 594 (Molecular Probes) and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Image acquisition was performed as described previously (27Daikoku T. Kudoh A. Fujita M. Sugaya Y. Isomura H. Tsurumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54817-54825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The anti-UL42 polyclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1:5000; all other primary antibodies were employed at 1:100 dilution and the secondary antibodies at 1:250 dilution. Newly synthesized DNAs were labeled by incubating cells with culture medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h prior to harvesting. Cells were fixed as described above and then treated for 10 min with 2 n HCl containing 0.5% Triton X-100 to expose incorporated BrdUrd residues before blocking, washing and neutralization with 0.1 m sodium tetraborate (pH 9.0) for 5 min. For BrdUrd staining, an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-BrdUrd mouse monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes) was applied. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—PCR products corresponding to a part of HSV-2 DNA Pol sequence (28Kimura H. Futamura M. Kito H. Ando T. Goto M. Kuzushima K. Shibata M. Morishima T. J. Infect Dis. 1991; 164: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were labeled with Chroma Tide Alexa Fluor 594-5-dUTP (Molecular Probes) by random primer labeling and used for detection of amplified HSV genomes. At first immunostaining was performed as described above, and then the samples were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde to cross-link bound antibodies. After permeabilizing in 0.2% Triton X-100 (20 min on ice), cells were digested with RNase A, dehydrated in ethanol, air-dried, and immediately covered with a probe mixture containing 50% formamide in 2× SSC containing probe DNA (10 ng/μl), 10% dextran sulfate, salmon sperm DNA (0.1 μg/μl), and yeast tRNA (1 μg/μl). Probe and cells were simultaneously heated at 94 °C for 4 min then incubated overnight at 37 °C. After hybridization, specimens were washed at 37 °C with 50% formamide in 2× SSC (twice for 15 min each) and 2× SSC. Finally, cells were equilibrated in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Measurements of Viral Growth Kinetics—293T-ATM shRNA or 293T-Control shRNA cells were infected with HSV-2 186 strain at an m.o.i. of 1 or 0.01 and harvested at the indicated hours postinfection by scraping into the medium and frozen at -80 °C. After thawing, the lysate was sonicated for 1 min on ice and virus yields were titrated by plaque assay on Vero cells (29Nishiyama Y. Rapp F. Virology. 1981; 110: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Preparation of ATM-silencing 293T Cells—For silencing ATM, the 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to ATM cDNA nucleotides 604–622 were expressed as shRNA by retrovirus vector. 293T cells were infected with the shRNA retroviruses, and shRNA expressing cells were selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Details of the vector construction and establishment of ATM-silenced 293T cells will be published elsewhere. HSV Infection Induces a Cellular DNA Damage Response—To investigate whether a cellular DNA damage response was induced upon HSV infection, we examined the phosphorylation status of DNA damage-response proteins in HFF cells (Fig. 1). The ATM kinase responds primarily to DSBs, and this pathway can act during all phases of the cell cycle. It has been recently proposed that ATM is usually present as an inactive multimer and this is activated by autophosphorylation at Ser-1981 after DSBs or changes in the chromatin sturucture (30Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, immunoblotting of cell lysates revealed that levels of the phosphorylated form of ATM at Ser-1981 increased upon HSV-2 and HSV-1 infection, although total levels of ATM remained constant throughout infection. The MRN complex consisting of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 has been suggested to act as a damage sensor (12D'Amours D. Jackson S.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 16Carson C.T. Schwartz R.A. Stracker T.H. Lilley C.E. Lee D.V. Weitzman M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), facilitating ATM activation (13Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Activated ATM also phosphorylates Nbs1 (10Gatei M. Young D. Cerosaletti K.M. Desai-Mehta A. Spring K. Kozlov S. Lavin M.F. Gatti R.A. Concannon P. Khanna K. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 11Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B. Crick K.E. Pierce K.A. Lane W.S. Rathbun G. Livingston D.M. Weaver D.T. Nature. 2000; 405: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, increase in levels of the gel retarded form of Nbs1 was observed, this becoming detectable after 8 or 4 h postinfection (p.i.) with HSV-2 or HSV-1 infection, respectively. The retarded form of Nbs1 was phosphorylated as judged by phosphatase treatment (data not shown). The level of Mre11 appeared constant throughout HSV infection, unlike the adenovirus case (16Carson C.T. Schwartz R.A. Stracker T.H. Lilley C.E. Lee D.V. Weitzman M.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6610-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 31Stracker T.H. Carson C.T. Weitzman M.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In the presence of DSBs, activated ATM is known to phosphorylate Thr-68 on Chk2 (8Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-Chk2 Thr-68-specific antibody also showed phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68 in both HSV-2 and HSV-1 infection (Fig. 1, A and B). Furthermore, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15, a widely accepted target of ATM kinase activity, was conspicuous at 8 h p.i. and 4 h p.i. on HSV-2 or HSV-1 infection, respectively, well consistent with the recently reported observation that HSV-1 induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 dependent on ATM (33Boutell C. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8068-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In general, phosphorylation of p53 leads to its stabilization and results in increase in its levels (34Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 35Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Although HSV-1 infection had no significant effect on total protein levels of p53 throughout (Fig. 1). This is also consistent with the previous report showing that the overall p53 levels are not greatly affected in the HSV-1 infection systems so far examined (36Boutell C. Everett R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36596-36602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All these data clearly indicate that HSV infection induces cellular DNA damage response. In contrast, this was not evident with UV-inactivated HSV-2 (Fig. 1A). UV-treated virus can adsorb and penetrate into the cells (37Johnson D.C. Ligas M.W. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but expression of the UL42 early viral protein (Fig. 1A) and viral DNA replication (data not shown) were inhibited. Furthermore, when HFF cells were infected with a replication-defective virus (HSV amplicon vector) (24Saeki Y. Ichikawa T. Saeki A. Chiocca E.A. Tobler K. Ackermann M. Breakefield X.O. Fraefel C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) at an m.o.i. of 2, the ATM response was abolished completely, although GFP from the amplicon DNA was expressed (Fig. 2A). In the presence of ACV, the ATM response by the HSV infection was not so inhibited (Fig. 2A). ACV triphosphate is incorporated into viral DNA competing with endogenous dGTP and terminates viral DNA synthesis. The chain termination of viral DNA synthesis might produce immature viral DNAs and consequently elicit the ATM DNA damage response (38Tomicic M.T. Bey E. Wutzler P. Thust R. Kaina B. Mutat. Res. 2002; 505: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, PAA, a specific inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase, appeared to block the ATM DNA damage signaling, especially at low multiplicity of infection (0.1 plaque-forming unit per cell) although the UL42 gene product, viral early protein, was significantly expressed (Fig. 2B). However, at high m.o.i. (1 plaque-forming unit per cell), the DNA damage response was induced to some extent even in the presence of PAA. PAA (400 μg/ml) might not inhibit viral DNA replication completely and immature viral DNA synthesis might be recognized by host damage sensors. Overall, these observations support the idea that viral DNA synthesis triggers activation of the DNA damage response upon HSV infection, but we cannot completely deny the possibility that viral gene expression induces the DNA damage response. It should be noted that not only ATM but also ATR kinases phosphorylate Chk2 kinase at Thr-68 and up-regulate its activity (8Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 32Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15 is also carried out by ATM/ATR kinases (39Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Kruhlak M.J. Pilch D.R. Staudt D.W. Lee A. Bonner R.F. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 40Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Therefore, HSV infection could activate the ATM, ATR, or both. The ATR kinase responds primarily to DNA replication stress during S phase (3Osborn A.J. Elledge S.J. Zou L. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It can also respond to DSBs if within the S phase but less efficiently than ATM. In contrast to the Chk2 case, phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser-345 is known to be carried out mainly by ATR kinase, leading to its activation (9Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-345 in HSV-2- and HSV-1-infected cells (Fig. 1). No significant phosphorylation was observed in either case. Treatment of cells with hydroxyurea, a well studied activator of the replication checkpoint, clearly induced phosphorylation of Ser-345 on Chk1, showing the ATR/Chk1 pathway to be intact in the cells. Thus, we conclude that lytic replication with both types 1 and 2 elicits activation of ATM DNA damage checkpoint signaling rather than the ATR pathway that responds to replication stress. Since both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection displayed similar cellular DNA damage response, all the following experiments were performed with HSV type2. Mre11 and Nbs1 Proteins Constituting the MRN Complex and Phosphorylated ATM Accumulate in Viral Replication Compartments—HSV DNA replication occurs at discrete sites in nuclei, called replication compartments, where viral replication proteins cluster and viral DNAs are synthesized. The replicating intermediate viral DNAs have large concatemeric and Y- and X-shaped branch structures (18Lehman I.R. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28059-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether ATM was recruited to the viral replication compartments. The HSV-2-infected cells were first extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100-mCSK buffer containing Triton X-100 to solubilize DNA-unbound forms of viral or cellular proteins and then subjected to immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the UL42 replication protein was localized in distinct sites in the nuclei of HSV-2-infected cells. HSV infection inhibits cellular replicative DNA synthesis and set forward viral DNA replication (41de Bruyn Kops A. Uprichard S.L. Chen M. Knipe D.M. Virology. 1998; 252: 162-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The staining sites were completely coincided with the localized foci of newly synthesized viral DNA as judged by BrdUrd incorporation and FISH analyses (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, since the UL42 protein-localized sites represent loci of viral DNA synthesis, UL42 proteins were thereafter used as markers for viral replication compartments. First, we examined whether DNA damage responsive proteins accumulate in such foci after HSV-2 infection. As shown in Fig. 3C, left panels, in the HSV-2-infected HFF cells, ATM phosphorylated at Ser-1981 was found to be resistant to detergent extraction and became colocalized with viral DNAs in the replication compartments. Next, we assessed the effect of HSV-2 infection on the localization of the Mre11 and Nbs1 (Fig. 3C, middle and right panels). IR resulted in distinct staining of Mre11 and Nbs1 in the nuclei as has been reported (42Kobayashi J. Tauchi H. Sakamoto S. Nakamura A. Morishima K. Matsuura S. Kobayashi T. Tamai K. Tanimoto K. Komatsu K. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1846-1851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 43Desai-Mehta A. Cerosaletti K.M. Concannon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2184-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), indicating that the MRN complex is activated and retained in the damaged sites. Upon HSV-2 infection, Mre11 and Nbs1 proteins became resistant to detergent treatment and colocalized predominantly in the viral replication compartments represented by the UL42 staining (Fig. 3C, middle and right panels). Once the pools of endogenous Mre11 and Nbs1 protein were concentrated in this way, the associated fluorescence became resistant to extraction with a mild detergent-containing extraction buffer, indicating that the Mre11 and Nbs1 proteins became not only redistributed to, but also retained within, the close vicinity of newly synthesized viral DNA. The ATM and MRN complex might recognize newly synthesized viral genomic DNA in the replication compartments as abnormal DNA structures and bind to them. Alternatively, it is possible that the complex might function as a player of homologous recombination involved in processing of viral genome rather than as a DNA damage sensor.

To map regions of Werner syndrome helicase (WRN) that interact with RPA, yeast two-hybrid studies, WRN affinity pull-down experiments and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with purified recombinant WRN protein fragments were performed. The results indicated that WRN has two RPA binding sites, a high affinity N-terminal site, and a lower affinity C-terminal site. Based on results from mapping studies, we sought to determine if the WRN N-terminal region harboring the high affinity RPA interaction site was important for RPA stimulation of WRN helicase activity. To accomplish this, we tested a catalytically active WRN helicase domain fragment (WRNH-R) that lacked the N-terminal RPA interaction site for its ability to unwind long DNA duplex substrates, which the wild-type enzyme can efficiently unwind only in the presence of RPA. WRNH-R helicase activity was significantly reduced on RPA-dependent partial duplex substrates compared with full-length WRN despite the presence of RPA. These results clearly demonstrate that, although WRNH-R had comparable helicase activity to full-length WRN on short duplex substrates, its ability to unwind RPA-dependent WRN helicase substrates was significantly impaired. Similarly, a Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) domain fragment, BLM642–1290, that lacked its N-terminal RPA interaction site also unwound short DNA duplex substrates similar to wild-type BLM, but was severely compromised in its ability to unwind long DNA substrates that full-length BLM helicase could unwind in the presence of RPA. These results suggest that the physical interaction between RPA and WRN or BLM helicases plays an important role in the mechanism for RPA stimulation of helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding.

Within the last decade, several genetic disorders with premature aging and/or cancer have been identified in which a gene member of the RecQ helicase family is mutated (1Bachrati C.Z. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1185-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RecQ helicases share a centrally located domain of ∼450 residues that contains the seven conserved helicase motifs (for review, see Ref. 3Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The founding member of the RecQ family, Escherichia coli RecQ helicase, has been extensively studied biochemically and has been genetically implicated in DNA recombination. A single yeast RecQ helicase, Sgs1 or Rqh1, is found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively, and these helicases are thought to be important in the cellular response to DNA-damaging agents and maintenance of genome stability. RecQ helicases have also been identified in a number of higher eukaryotes, including Xenopus laevis (focus forming activity 1 (FFA-1) 1The abbreviations used are: FFA-1, focus forming activity 1; WRN, Werner syndrome helicase; BLM, Bloom syndrome helicase; WS, Werner syndrome; BS, Bloom syndrome; RQC, helicase domain designated RecQ-Ct; HRD, helicase-related domain; RPA, replication protein A; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin.), Drosophila melanogaster (DmBLM and DmRecQ5), and Caenorhabditis elegans (WRN-1, Ce-RCQ5, HIM-6, and RECQL/Q1). These helicases have proposed functions in DNA replication or repair; however, the precise details of their roles in cellular pathways of DNA metabolism are still under investigation. There are five human RecQ helicases: 1) WRN, defective in Werner syndrome (WS); 2) BLM, defective in Bloom syndrome (BS); 3) RECQL4, defective in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome and RAPADILINO; 4) RECQ1; and 5) RECQ5. The human RecQ helicase disorders have distinctly different clinical phenotypes; however, WS, BS, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome are all characterized by genomic instability, an elevated cancer incidence, and/or particular aspects of premature aging. Human diseases have not yet been genetically linked to mutations in RECQ1 or RECQ5. The prominent roles of RecQ helicases in the maintenance of genome stability suggest that RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases are also likely to be important in vivo. In addition to the conserved helicase motifs, the majority of RecQ helicases have a second conserved region of ∼80 amino acids located C-terminal to the helicase domain designated RecQ-Ct (RQC) (4Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although the conserved helicase domain is responsible for coupling nucleotide hydrolysis to DNA unwinding, recent studies suggest that the RQC motif plays an important role in protein interactions (5Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), nucleolar localization (6von Kobbe C. Bohr V.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and/or DNA binding (7von Kobbe C. Thoma N.H. Czyzewski B.K. Pavletich N.P. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52997-53006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The WRN protein is unique among the human RecQ helicases in that it also contains a region of homology to the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain of proofreading enzymes (8Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the WRN protein has a direct repeat of a highly acidic 27-amino acid sequence located in the N terminus between the exonuclease and helicase domains (8Yu C.E. Oshima J. Fu Y.H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Although the exact functional significance of this repeated sequence is not known, and only one copy of the sequence is found in Xenopus FFA-1, this acidic repeat has been implicated in studies of the human WRN protein to play a role in transcriptional activation (9Balajee A.S. Machwe A. May A. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Martin G.M. Nehlin J.O. Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2655-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A C-terminal conserved motif designated helicase-related domain (HRD), found in a number of DNA-metabolizing proteins, is present in many RecQ helicases (4Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and recent evidence suggests that the domain is important in DNA binding (7von Kobbe C.

Biochemical analyses of the purified recombinant WRN protein from a number of laboratories, including ours, have characterized the catalytic activities and protein interactions of WRN (for review, see Refs. 5Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and 10Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 791-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). WRN protein has been shown to unwind relatively short DNA duplexes of 20–30 bp in the absence of any auxiliary factors with a 3′ to 5′ polarity (11Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2973-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, WRN is a relatively poor helicase on longer DNA duplexes such as a 34-bp forked duplex (14Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or 69-bp M13 partial duplex DNA substrate (15Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), suggesting that the enzyme has limited processivity in the unwinding reaction. WRN helicase can catalyze unwinding of longer DNA duplexes up to 851 bp in a reaction dependent on replication protein A (RPA) (15Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that is implicated in the processes of DNA replication, recombination and repair, and transcription (16Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Consistent with the functional interaction between WRN and RPA, the two proteins physically interact (15Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 17Shen J.C. Lao Y. Kamath-Loeb A. Wold M.S. Loeb L.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2003; 124: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism for stimulation of WRN-catalyzed DNA unwinding is not well understood. To address the mechanism for RPA stimulation of WRN helicase activity, we have begun to evaluate the importance of the physical interaction between WRN and RPA for the stimulation of helicase activity. In this work, we have mapped the RPA binding sites on WRN protein using multiple approaches and identified a high affinity RPA interaction site in the N terminus. Biochemical analyses of a purified recombinant WRN protein fragment, WRNH-R, that contains the helicase core domain and RQC motif, but lacks the N-terminal region and C-terminal regions of WRN, retains its ability to unwind short (28 bp) M13 partial duplexes nearly as efficiently as full-length WRN helicase; however, WRNH-R is severely compromised in its ability to unwind longer (50–850 bp) DNA substrates that the full-length WRN protein can efficiently unwind in the presence of RPA. These results demonstrate that WRN helicase binds tightly to RPA via its N-terminal domain and suggest that this physical protein interaction with RPA is likely to be important in the mechanism of RPA-dependent stimulation of WRN helicase activity. In addition to WRN, human BLM (18Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23500-23508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), RECQ1 (19Cui S. Arosio D. Doherty K.M. Brosh Jr., R.M. Falaschi A. Vindigni A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2158-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and RECQ5β (20Garcia P.L. Liu Y. Jiricny J. West S.C. Janscak P. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2882-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) helicases also physically and functionally interact with RPA, but the details of how RPA stimulates the unwinding activities of these DNA helicases are also largely unknown. Similar to our findings with WRN, we report here that BLM helicase contains a high affinity N-terminal RPA interaction site. A BLM recombinant fragment lacking this RPA interaction site, but containing the RQC and HRD motifs, was shown to be defective in unwinding long DNA duplex substrates despite the presence of RPA. Our studies indicate that both WRN and BLM helicases contain an N-terminal RPA binding domain that is important for the stimulation of helicase activity by RPA. The important cellular roles of RPA in DNA metabolism are likely to involve specific interactions with human RecQ helicases in pathways that maintain genome stability. Yeast Two-hybrid Reporter Assay—A two-hybrid screen was performed as previously described (9Balajee A.S. Machwe A. May A. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Martin G.M. Nehlin J.O. Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2655-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, L40 S. cerevisiae reporter strain, pBTM116 (LexA DNA-binding domain) and pVP16 (herpes simplex virus VP16 transcriptional activation domain) fusion vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Stanley Hollenberg. Yeast media were purchased from BIO 101 (La Jolla, CA), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) was from Sigma. LexA-WRN fusion protein constructs were created using the expression vector pBTM116 (21Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). This plasmid carries the TRP1 gene for selection in yeast and a multiple cloning site inserted after the 202-amino acid open reading frame of the E. coli lexA gene, which encodes an SOS function regulatory protein and is driven by a constitutive yeast ADH promoter in this vector. In-frame fusions between the C terminus of the LexA protein and specified domains of the human WRN protein were created by insertion of PCR-generated WRN cDNA domains into the multiple cloning sites of pBTM116 as previously described (6von Kobbe C. Bohr V.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, the full-length WRN cDNA fusion, construct WRN+, was created by insertion of the unique BamHI-SspI WRN cDNA fragment into the BamHI and SalI (filled in) sites of WRN domain within pBTM116. To create WRN–1/2, a single copy of the acidic 27-amino acid repeat was removed from construct WRN+ by deletion of the unique AflII-AflII fragment of the WRN cDNA, which occurs within the repeated sequence. To create the full deletion of the repeated sequence, WRN–R, a PCR fragment was generated from WRN cDNA using primers TH1 (5′-GCC AGA TCT TGG AAA CAA CTG CAC-3′) and THΔR (5′-CGG CTT AAG CTC AGT AGA TTT A-3′), which was digested with BamHI and AflII and then substituted for the BamHI-AflII WRN fragment of construct WRN–1/2. This PCR product results in the addition of a novel AflII site located just before the acidic repeat sequence, which becomes fused upon ligation to the distal AflII site within the endogenous WRN message. To create the WRN+, WRN–1/2, and WRN–R fusion protein constructs, regions of the wild-type or deleted repeat domains were amplified directly from the corresponding full-length constructs as previously described (9Balajee A.S. Machwe A. May A. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Martin G.M. Nehlin J.O. Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Bohr V.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2655-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These PCR products were then inserted into the pBTM116 vector at the chosen restriction sites. VP16-WRN fusion protein constructs were created using the expression vector pVP16 (21Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). This plasmid carries the LEU2 gene for selection in yeast and a multiple cloning site inserted after the herpes simplex virus VP16 transcriptional activation domain. In-frame fusions between the C terminus of the VP16 protein, and specified domains of the human WRN protein were created by insertion of PCR-generated WRN cDNA domains into the multiple cloning sites of pVP16. RPA fusion protein constructs were created by PCR amplification of individual full-length RPA protein subunits (cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Marc Wold) using primers containing restriction sites compatible with pBTM116 (for LexA fusions) or pVP16 (for VP16 fusions) multiple cloning sites. For C-terminal truncated versions of the RPA70 subunit, stop codons were introduced within PCR reverse primers directly after the specified amino acid codon or, in the case of the N-terminal truncation, the forward primer initiated at the indicated internal amino acid position within the cDNA sequence. All fusion protein constructs were confirmed by manual sequencing to be in-frame and devoid of mutations. For two-hybrid assays, S. cerevisiae LexA reporter strain L40 (MATa his3Δ200 trp1–901 leu2–3112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-LacZ GAL4 gal80) was co-transformed with the indicated pairs of LexA- and VP16 fusion protein constructs or control vectors. To assess the relative reporter activities of each pair, positive co-transformants were selected on yeast media plates lacking tryptophan and leucine, and multiple colonies of each pairing were restreaked to templates for even growth (2–3 days on the same media). Co-transformant templates were then replica-plated onto yeast media plates lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 0–500 mm 3-AT. Replica plating was performed in reverse order (i.e. from high 3-AT concentration to low) to ensure efficient transfer throughout the series. Relative growth on 3-AT-containing plates was assessed after 10 days of incubation at 30 °C. All reporter assays were repeated in at least three different experiments. Reporter strength was essentially invariable within multiple co-transformants (original colonies isolated) of each construct pair in all 3-AT growth experiments. Proteins—Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged WRN protein was overexpressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system and purified as described previously (22Sharma S. Otterlei M. Sommers J.A. Driscoll H.C. Dianov G.L. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Brosh Jr., R.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 734-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) fusion proteins of WRN were subcloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pGEXCS (Amersham Biosciences) as described elsewhere (23Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Inframe fusions of GST-2R (WRN residues 406–525) or GST-0R (WRN residues 406–525 with intervening residues 424–475 deleted) were created by inserting the PCR products, generated in the same way as for the two-hybrid system, into the BamHI site within the multiple cloning site of the pGEXCS vector. GST-WRN fragment fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (23Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A recombinant WRN protein fragment (exact boundaries to be described elsewhere), 2Nicolas H. Thoma, submitted for publication. designated WRNH-R, was overexpressed using a baculovirus insect cell system and purified using immobilized glutathione beads. WRNH-R contains the entire helicase domain (motifs I–VI) and the conserved RQC region but lacks the N-terminal sequence, including the acidic repeats as well as the C-terminal region after the RQC motif (Fig. 5A). Hexahistidine-tagged recombinant BLM protein, was overexpressed in S. cerevisiae and purified as previously described (24Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expression constructs for maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins of BLM fragments (25Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and the BLM642–1290 protein fragment were kindly provided by Dr. Ian Hickson (Cancer Research UK Laboratories). MBP-BLM fusion proteins were purified as previously described (25Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, MBP-BLM fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (New England Biolabs) that had been transformed with the pMAL-C2 expression plasmids containing various portions of the BLM cDNA (MBP-BLM1–447 and MBP-BLM966–1417). BL21(DE3) cells transformed with plasmid encoding MBP were used for control experiments. Overnight transformed bacterial cultures were used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria Bertani broth supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at a 1:100 dilution, and the cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cultures were allowed to grow for an additional 3 h before being chilled on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA10 rotor, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at the manufacturer's recommended concentration. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 9,000 × g in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. The crude extract was diluted 1:5 with column buffer and then bound to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) that had been pre-washed with column buffer. The resin was washed with 12 volumes of column buffer before the recombinant protein was eluted from the resin with column buffer supplemented with 10 mm maltose. RPA containing all three subunits (RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14) was purified as previously described (26Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-WRN-Sepharose Pull-down Experiments—GST-WRN pull-down experiments were performed as previously described (23Brosh Jr., R.M. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-WRN fusion proteins were overexpressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 8 h at 23 °C. The bacterial cell pellet was lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 10% glycerol, 0.4% Triton X-100). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm (Ti-60 rotor; Beckman) for 1 h at 4 °C. One milliliter of the resulting supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of GS beads (50% v/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and split into two aliquots, one for binding experiments and one for determination of background signal in Western blot analysis. For binding experiments, protein-bound beads were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with 1.2 μg of purified recombinant RPA in 250 μl of buffer D (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). The beads were subsequently washed three times with 500 μl of buffer D and eluted by boiling treatment in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer. Proteins were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Control membranes were stained with Amido Black reagent to demonstrate equal loading of protein samples. Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-RPA antibody (Ab-1, 1:20, Oncogene Research Products), followed by horse anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Vector) and visualized using ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia). ELISA Assays—The indicated purified recombinant WRN or BLM proteins (full-length or fragment) were diluted to a concentration of 18 nm in carbonate buffer (0.016 m Na2CO3, 0.034 m NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and were added to individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate (50 μl/well), which was then incubated at 4 °C overnight. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used in the coating step for control reactions. After the initial binding step, samples were aspirated and the wells were blocked for 2 h at 30 °C with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20, and 3% BSA). After washing, RPA was diluted to 144 nm in blocking buffer and was added to the appropriate wells of the ELISA plate (50 μl/well), which was then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The samples were aspirated, and the wells were washed five times before addition of anti-RPA (Ab-1) mouse monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer, followed by incubation at 30 °C for 1 h. Following three washes, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2500) diluted in blocking buffer was added to the wells, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. After washing five times, RPA bound to the proteins was detected using O-phenylenediamine substrate (Sigma). The reaction was terminated after 5 min with 3 n H2SO4, and absorbance readings were taken at 490 nm. Data analysis for determination of the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was performed as previously described (18Brosh Jr., R.M. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P.

The oligonucleotides used for the 28-, 50-, 69-, and 100-bp M13 partial duplex helicase substrates were purchased from Midland Certified Reagents Co. (Midland, TX). The 28-, 50-, 69-, 100-, and 849-bp M13mp18 partial duplex substrate were constructed using oligonucleotides complementary to positions 6296–6323, 6272–6322, 6254–6322, and 6039–6138, respectively, in the M13mp18 ssDNA circle. The 849-bp fragment, in which one strand was complementary to positions 1396–2244 of the M13mp18 ssDNA circle was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CCTTTAACTCCCTGCAAGCC-3′ and 5′-AAACAAACACTTATAGTTCC-3′. The M13mp18 partial duplex substrates were radioactively labeled and constructed as previously described (15Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Helicase Assays—Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) using the M13 partial duplex substrates contained 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mg/ml tRNA, and the indicated concentration of WRN or BLM protein. For assays using the 19-bp forked duplex substrate, reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 100 ng/μl BSA, 5% glycerol, and DNA substrate concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Reaction mixtures were initiated by the addition of WRN or BLM protein. Helicase reactions were incubated at 37 °C and were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA-40% glycerol-0.9% SDS-0.1% bromphenol blue-0.1% xylene cyanol at time points indicated in the figure legends for M13 partial duplex substrates or 37 °C for 15 min using the 19-bp forked duplex substrate. The products of helicase reactions were resolved on nondenaturing 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels for the reactions with M13 partial duplex (28, 50, 69, and 100 bp) or oligonucleotide based forked duplex substrates, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2097237683,"Bone mineral density (BMD) is a major risk factor for osteoporosis. Circulating monocytes may serve as early progenitors of osteoclasts and produce a wide variety of factors important to bone metabolism. However, little is known about the roles of circulating monocytes in relation to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. Using the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip® array, we performed a comparative gene expression study of circulating monocytes in subjects with high and low BMD. We identified in total 66 differentially expressed genes including some novel as well as some already known to be relevant to bone metabolism. Three genes potentially contributing to bone metabolism, CCR3 (chemokine receptor 3), HDC (histidine decarboxylase, i.e. the histamine synthesis enzyme), and GCR (glucocorticoid receptor), were confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR as up-regulated in subjects with lower BMD. In addition, significant negative correlation was observed between expression levels of the genes and BMD Z-scores. These three genes and/or their products mediate monocyte chemotaxis, histamine production, and/or sensitivity to glucocorticoids. Our results suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism for osteoporosis that is characterized by increased recruitment of circulating monocyte into bone, enhanced monocyte differentiation into osteoclasts, as well as osteoclast stimulation via monocyte functional changes. This is the first in vivo microarray study of osteoporosis in humans. The results may contribute to identification of new genes and their functions for osteoporosis and suggest genetic markers to discern individuals at higher risk to osteoporosis with an aim for preventive intervention and treatment.

Osteoporosis is most frequently characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD). 1The abbreviations used are: BMD, bone mineral density; DEG, differentially expressed genes; FDR, false discovery rate; CCR3, chemokine receptor 3; HDC, histidine decarboxylase; GCR, glucocorticoid receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: BMD, bone mineral density; DEG, differentially expressed genes; FDR, false discovery rate; CCR3, chemokine receptor 3; HDC, histidine decarboxylase; GCR, glucocorticoid receptor. The well accepted pathophysiological mechanisms for low bone mass include prolongation of the life span of osteoclasts (1Boyce B.F. Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Xing L. Dai A. Lab. Investig. 1999; 79: 83-94PubMed Google Scholar) and early apoptosis of osteoblasts (2Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. Jilka R.L. Recent Prog. Horm.

Recently, the imbalance between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was suggested as a new mechanism for osteoporosis (5Nuttall M.E. Gimble J.M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, the above mechanisms were discovered mainly through in vitro studies or in vivo studies using animals. Their comprehensiveness and exhaustiveness is unclear, and their direct relevance to osteoporosis in humans is yet to be established.Circulating monocytes may serve as progenitors of osteoclasts (6Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Tanaka H. Sasaki T. Nishihara T. Koga T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7260-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 7Zambonin Z.A.

Monocytes isolated from peripheral blood can differentiate in vitro into the multinuclear cells that express typical osteoclast markers and are able to resorb bone (6Udagawa N. Takahashi N. Akatsu T.

Biochem. 1994; 55: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar) come from circulating monocytes. Blood monocytes also produce a wide variety of factors involved in bone metabolism, such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, and 1,25(OH)2D3 (12Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Circulating mononuclear cells of osteoporotic patients, when induced in vitro into osteoclasts, demonstrated increased levels of bone resorption activity as compared with normal controls (13Jevon M. Hirayama T. Brown M.A. Wass J.A. Sabokbar A. Ostelere S. Athenasou N.A. Scand. J. Rheumatol. 2003; 32: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).For both peripheral and central skeleton, the access route of circulating monocytes into the bone microenvironment is through the structure called sinusoid (14Parfitt A.M. Bone (N. Y.). 1998; 23: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that occupies the center of a basic multicellular unit, the functional unit of bone remodeling. Recruitment of circulating monocytes into bone is modulated mainly by chemotaxis (15Graves D.T. Jiang Y. Valente A.J. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: D571-D580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereby monocyte chemoattractants from bone and their receptors on monocytes, such as chemokine receptors, interact to initiate and maintain a directed migration of monocytes toward bone tissue.Given the importance of the circulating monocytes in bone metabolism, currently, surprisingly little is known about the in vivo roles of circulating monocytes in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. Microarrays are a powerful tool to provide a comprehensive picture of cell function as they can assay expression of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously; however, they have not been attempted for in vivo studies in humans to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying osteoporosis. Here, with an in vivo approach directly in humans, we explore other potential mechanisms for osteoporosis, which are mediated by or reflected in circulating monocytes.We hypothesized that gene expression profiles of circulating monocytes differ between high and low BMD women. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are potentially important for the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. To identify these genes, we applied the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip® array to analyze the gene expression profiles of circulating monocytes in subjects with extremely discordant BMD values.MATERIALS AND METHODSSubjectsThe study was approved by the Creighton University Institutional Review Board. All the study subjects signed informed consent documents before entering the project. We established strict criteria to exclude non-genetic factors that might cause BMD variation. Additional criteria were implemented to exclude diseases/conditions that may potentially lead to gene expression changes of circulating monocytes. The detailed criteria are included in the Supplemental Data.The recruited women were all Caucasians and aged between 47 and 55 with an average age of ∼51. The narrow age window may minimize the potential age effects on monocyte gene expression (16Perkins S.L. Gibbons R. Kling S. Kahn A.J. Bone (N. Y.). 1994; 15: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Cohen-Solal M.E. Boitte F. Bernard-Poenaru O. Denne M.A. Graulet A.M. Brazier M. De Vernejoul M.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 1687-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among the 19 subjects, 10 had high spine BMD, with an average L1-L4 Z-score of +2.47, and 9 had low spine BMD, with an average L1-L4 Z-score of -1.43. The Z-score is defined as the number of standard deviations of a BMD measurement above (i.e. a positive Z-score) or below (i.e. a negative Z-score) the age-, gender-, and ethnicity-matched mean BMD. The average Z-score for the high BMD subjects places them in the top 0.68% of the normal population distribution, whereas the Z-score for the low BMD subjects places them in the bottom 7.6% of the normal population distribution. Among the 10 high BMD subjects, five were premenopausal, and five were postmenopausal. Among the nine low BMD subjects, four were premenopausal, and five were postmenopausal. In our study, menopause was defined as cessation of menstruation for at least one year. The recruitment scheme for menopausal status ensures that the DEGs found between the 10 high and 9 low BMD subjects are only related to BMD. Detailed characteristics of the subjects are available in Table I.Table ICharacteristics of study subjects ZBMD represents the BMD Z score.PremenopausalPostmenopausalnAge (S.D.)L1-4 ZBMD (S.D.)nAge (S.D.)L1-4 ZBMD (S.D.)High BMD549.4 (3.21)2.71 (0.901)552.6 (1.82)2.22 (0.928)Low BMD450.5 (2.89)-1.11 (0.429)551.4 (1.52)-1.69 (0.159) Open table in a new tab We used a method recommended by Affymetrix to evaluate our sample size (e.g. the number of replicates per condition) (18Inc Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA2002Google Scholar). According to the method, coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated for certain percentiles (e.g. the 25th, 50th, and 75th) of signal intensities for a data set containing 1, 2, 3,..., and n replicates. Comparison is made between the calculated CVs of certain percentiles for different numbers of replicates. The optimal sample size is achieved when the value of CV is stabilized, that is, does not change appreciably from n replicates to n + 1 replicates. Under such a situation, it is unlikely that additional replicates will improve significantly the accuracy of the estimation for the standard deviations of the sample, which is ultimately used to determine statistical significance in parametric statistical tests.Based on the calculations with the raw microarray data in our study, we observed that the CV became stabilized at seven replicates for the 25th and the 50th percentile of signal intensities and at nine replicates for the 75th percentile of signal intensities (Fig. 1). Therefore, our sample size is sufficient and decent to provide adequate statistical power for detecting differential gene expression.BMD MeasurementBMD (g/cm2) for the lumbar spine (L1-L4) was measured with a Hologic 4500 dual energy x-ray absorptiometer scanner (Hologic Corp., Waltham, MA). The machine was calibrated daily. The coefficient of variation of the dual energy x-ray absorptiometer measurements for BMD was 0.9%. None of our subjects had any known conditions that might artificially increase BMD values, such as osteophytes and facet sclerosis.Experimental ProceduresMonocyte Isolation—Monocyte isolation from 30 ml of whole blood was performed with a monocyte-negative isolation kit (Dynal Biotech Inc., Lake Success, NY) following manufacturer's recommendation. The kit contains a highly optimized antibody mix, blocking reagent, and Depletion Dynabeads® to deplete T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells from mononuclear cells, leaving monocytes untouched and free of the surface-bound antibody and beads. Our flow cytometry results showed an average monocyte purity of 86% ± 3% in the samples.Total RNA Extraction—Total RNA from monocytes was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA).Preparation of cRNA and Gene Chip Hybridization—Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the HG-U133A GeneChip® was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was performed in two steps, i.e. the first step of reverse transcription for synthesis of cDNA from total RNA and the secondary step of real-time quantitative PCR.Reverse transcription reactions were performed in a 30-μl reaction volume, containing 3 μlof10× PCR Buffer II (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 500 mm KCl, 0.01% w/v gelatin), 6 μl of 2.5 mm MgCl2, 8 μl of dNTPs, 1 μl of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor, 1 μl of oligo(dT), 0.5 μg of total RNA, and water to 10 μl. All of the above reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Reaction conditions were as follows, 10 min at 20 °C, 60 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 95 °C.Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume using standard protocols on an Applied Biosystems 7000 sequence detection system. Briefly, 5 μl of cDNA was mixed with 25 μl of TaqMan universal PCR master mix (2×), 2.5 μl of Assays-on-Demand™ gene expression assay mix (contains forward and reverse primers and labeled probe), 2.5 μl of human GAPDH (20×), and 15 μl of water. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C plus 1 min at 60 °C. The thermal denaturation protocol was run at the end of the PCR to determine the copy number of products that were present in the reaction. All reactions were run in triplicates and included “no template” controls for each gene.The TaqMan gene expression assays all have amplification efficiencies very close to 1 (19Biosystems Applied Applied Biosystems Application Note, Amplification Efficiency of TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA2004Google Scholar). Thus, it was not necessary for us to perform validation experiments to test the equality of the amplification efficiencies between the target genes and the reference gene (GAPDH).Data AnalysesWe used a method by Golub et al. (20Golub T.R. Slonim D.K. Tamayo P. Huard C. Gaasenbeek M. Mesirov J.P. Coller H. Loh M.L. Downing J.R. Caligiuri M.A. Bloomfield C.D. Lander E.S. Science. 1999; 286: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9129) Google Scholar) to preselect a subset of genes from the total of around 14,500 genes in the array for further analyses. The preselection process minimizes the multiple-testing problem by excluding from further analysis the genes with relatively constant expression across the samples. It was based on the expression values generated with the MAS 5.0 software (Affymetrix). We selected a subset of 8,623 probe sets from a total of 22,283 for around 14,500 genes. Subsequent data analyses were performed on these selected probe sets using Bioconductor packages (21Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K. Hothorn T. Huber W. Iacus S. Irizarry R. Leisch F. Li C. Maechler M. Rossini A.J. Sawitzki G. Smith C. Smyth G. Tierney L. Yang J.Y. Zhang J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Bioconductor Affy package (22Gautier L. Cope L. Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (3788) Google Scholar) was used to process the probe-level data (raw data) and transform the data into expression data using the robust multiarray average algorithm (23Irizarry R.A. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y.D. Antonellis K.J. Scherf U. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8383) Google Scholar).Based on the expression data generated with the robust multiarray average algorithm, the Bioconductor Multtest package was used to identify DEGs between high versus low BMD subjects. To account for multiple testing, the Benjamini and Hochberg stepwise procedure (24Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar), which controls for the false discovery rate, was implemented to generate adjusted p values.RESULTSDEGs Suggested by Microarray Analyses—All the raw microarray data are available. 2Y.-Z. Liu, V. Dvornyk, Y. Lu, H. Shen, J. M. Lappe, R. R. Recker, and H.-W. Deng, personal communication. We also submitted the data to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus data repository under accession number GSE2208. Based on the analysis with the MAS 5.0 software (Affymetrix), on average, 39.69% of a total of 22,283 probe sets in the array were called “present” for our samples.Of the preselected 8,623 probe sets, we identified 67 (corresponding to 66 genes) differentially expressed between the high and low BMD subjects (Benjamini and Hochberg stepwise procedure-adjusted p < 0.05). These genes are listed in the order of the adjusted p values in Table 1 of the Supplemental Data. Forty-six genes are up-regulated and 20 are down-regulated in the low BMD subjects as compared with the high BMD ones. Since the majority of the genes listed in the table have not been confirmed with real-time RT-PCR, the significance of their differential expression (i.e. the p values) should be interpreted with caution.DEGs Validated through Real-time RT-PCR—The number of monocytes we obtained from the 30 ml of blood of each subject was limited, and the total RNA was scarce. Therefore, our criteria for selection of genes for further real-time RT-PCR validation were stringent and comprehensive. They were based not only on the statistical significance of the differential expression of a gene as detected by microarray (i.e. the Benjamini and Hochberg stepwise procedure-adjusted p < 0.05) but also on its potential functional relevance to bone metabolism. Accordingly, we selected six genes for real-time RT-PCR validation, which are CCR3 (chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 3), HDC (histidine decarboxylase), GCR (glucocorticoid receptor), RAMP3 (receptor (calcitonin) activity-modifying protein 3), SCYE1 (small inducible cytokine subfamily E, member 1), and FCER1A (Fc fragment of IgE, high affinity I, receptor for α-polypeptide). These genes and/or their products, through modulation of monocytes, are known to participate in bone monocyte recruitment (CCR3, HDC) (15Graves D.T. Jiang Y. Valente A.J.

As our subjects were also stratified by menopausal status, comparison of gene expression between high and low BMD subjects was also performed among premenopausal as well as postmenopausal women. Since the major aim of this study was focused on identifying genes related to BMD variation, factorial analysis for identifying differential gene expression due to menopause and/or interaction between BMD and menopause was not performed here and was pursued elsewhere (36.Dvornyk, V., Liu, Y. Z., Lu, Y., Shen, H., Wilde, J., Conway, T., Recker, R. R., and Deng, H. W. (2004) 54th Annual Meeting of American Society of Human Genetics, Toronto, Canada, October 26-30, 2004, p. 307 (Abstr. 1650), The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, ILGoogle Scholar). The t tests confirmed the differential expression for three genes. CCR3 and HDC were up-regulated, by 3- (p = 0.0002) and 4-fold (p = 0.022), respectively, in the low versus the high BMD subjects, and GCR was 2-fold up-regulated in the premenopausal low versus high BMD subjects (p = 0.027).We also observed significant negative correlation between the expression levels of the three genes as quantified by real-time PCR and BMD Z-scores. For the HDC, CCR3, and GCR genes, the correlation coefficients were -0.458 (p = 0.048), -0.687 (p = 0.001), and -0.816 (p = 0.007), respectively.Although there was significant difference in expression between the high and the low BMD groups for the three genes, there is no clear threshold level for their expression, which might be associated with the low BMD subjects. Therefore, the expression levels may represent continuous variables, which negatively correlate with BMD.The reason for only three out of the six candidate genes being confirmed by real-time RT-PCR might be related to the absolute expression levels of the genes. Genes with moderate expression levels tend to have higher correlation between expression quantification results obtained by microarray and RT-PCR (37Etienne W. Meyer M.H. Peppers J. Meyer Jr., R.A. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, in our study, among the six selected genes, the three confirmed ones had expression levels within the middle range (i.e. from 800 to 1,300 according to microarray quantification using the MAS 5.0 software), whereas the other three had more extreme expression levels (i.e. less than 300 or more than 3,000). Statistically, this may also be due to problems associated with multiple testing and statistical power for replication (see detailed elaboration under “Discussion”).We chose GAPDH as the endogenous control gene for the real-time RT-PCR because its expression levels in microarrays were very consistent and stable across all the samples. In the HG-U133A array, there are three independent probe sets, among a total of 22,283, for the GAPDH gene. The three probe sets for the GAPDH gene were ranked by their CVs of expression at the upper 0.2th, 0.3th, and 1.7th percentile, respectively, higher than all other well known housekeeping genes, including the actin and the 18S gene. Therefore, the GAPDH gene has the most stable expression as compared with other well known endogenous control genes and is also ranked among the most consistently expressed genes on the array.DISCUSSIONIt has already been suggested that functional changes of osteoclasts (1Boyce B.F.

In this study, we scanned expression of ∼14,500 genes of circulating monocytes from human subjects using the microarray approach and identified, among the others, three important genes related to BMD variation. The potential functions of the three genes allowed us to propose a model (Fig. 2) suggesting a potential and novel monocyte-mediated pathophysiological mechanism for osteoporosis.Fig. 2Potential effects on bone metabolism caused by the up-regulation of the CCR3, HDC, and GCR gene in circulating monocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1968654429,"Dynein is a minus-end-directed microtubule motor with critical roles in mitosis, membrane transport and intracellular transport. Several proteins regulate dynein activity, including dynactin1, LIS1 (refs 2, 3) and NudEL (NudE-like)2,4,5,6,7,8. Here, we identify a NUDEL homologue in budding yeast and name it Ndl1. The ndl1Δ null mutant shows decreased targeting of dynein to microtubule plus ends, an essential element of the model for dynein function. We find that Ndl1 regulates dynein targeting through LIS1, with which it interacts biochemically, but not through CLIP170, another plus-end protein involved in dynein targeting9. Ndl1 is found at far fewer microtubule ends than are LIS1 and dynein. However, when Ndl1 is present at a plus end, the molar amount of Ndl1 approaches that of LIS1 and dynein. We propose a model in which Ndl1 binds transiently to the plus end to promote targeting of LIS1, which cooperatively recruits dynein."
https://openalex.org/W2022092714,"Rat intestinal epithelial cells that express the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene permanently (RIES cells) were used as a model of in vivo oxidative stress. A targeted lipidomics approach showed that 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE) was the major hydroxylated non-esterified lipid formed in unstimulated intact cells. The corresponding hydroperoxide, 15(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HPETE) undergoes homolytic decomposition to the DNA-reactive bifunctional electrophile 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal, a precursor of heptanone-etheno-2′-deoxyguanosine. This etheno adduct was identified in the DNA of RIES cells. A dose-dependent increase in adduct levels was observed in the presence of vitamin C. This suggested that vitamin C increased lipid hydroperoxide-mediated 4-oxo-2(E)-nonenal formation in the cells. The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 was protective against cellular DNA damage but was less effective if vitamin C was present. Prostaglandin E2 and 15(S)-HETE biosynthesis were completely inhibited by 110 μm NS-398 in the intact RIES cells. No inhibition of COX-1 was detected in the wild-type RIE cells at this concentration of NS-398. Arachidonic acid treatment of RIES cell lysates and ionophore stimulation of intact RIES cells produced significantly more 15(R)-HETE than the untreated intact cells. These preparations also both produced 11(R)-HETE, which was not detected in the intact cells. Aspirin treatment of the intact unstimulated RIES cells resulted in the exclusive formation of 15(R)-HETE in amounts that were slightly higher than the original 15(S)-HETE observed in the absence of aspirin, implying that significant amounts of 15(R)-HPETE had also been formed. 15(R)-HPETE should give exactly the same amount of heptanone-etheno-2′-deoxyguanosine as its 15(S)-enantiomer. However, no increase in heptanone-etheno adduct formation occurred in the aspirin-treated cells. The present study suggests a potential mechanism of tumorigenesis that involves DNA adduct formation from COX-2-mediated lipid peroxidation rather than prostaglandin formation. Therefore, inhibition of COX-2-mediated lipid hydroperoxide formation offers a potential therapeutic alternative to COX-2 inhibitors in chemoprevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2014205300,"Previous work has shown that the transcriptional regulator β-catenin can translocate to the nuclei when cells are stimulated with the type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). We show by immunocoprecipitation and by confocal microscopy that β-catenin binds to and co-localizes with the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a docking protein for both the insulin and the IGF-1 receptors. IRS-1 is required for IGF-1-mediated nuclear translocation of β-catenin, resulting in the activation of the β-catenin target genes. IGF-1-mediated nuclear translocation of β-catenin is facilitated by the nuclear translocation of IRS-1. Both IRS-1 and β-catenin are recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter, an established target for β-catenin, but only IRS-1 is recruited to the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter. UBF proteins (known to interact with both IRS-1 and β-catenin) are also detectable in the cyclin D1 and rDNA promoters. These results indicate that IRS-1 (activated by the IGF-1 receptor) is one of several proteins that regulate the subcellular localization and activity of β-catenin. The ability of IRS-1 to localize to both RNA polymerase II (with β-catenin) and RNA polymerase I-regulated promoters suggest an explanation for the effect of IRS-1 on both cell growth in size and cell proliferation. This possibility is supported by the demonstration that enforced nuclear localization of IRS-1 causes nuclear translocation of β-catenin and transformation of normal mouse embryo fibroblasts (colony formation in soft agar).

The important roles played by β-catenin in adhesion, cancer, and development and its connections to Wnt and APC have been discussed in recent reviews (1Nelson W.J. Nusse R.

Under certain circumstances, for instance Wnt signaling, β-catenin is stabilized and transferred to the nuclei where it binds members of the family of T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factors (Tcf/Lef) and activates transcription of target genes (5Eastman Q.

We have previously reported that IGF-1 stimulates the expression of both c-myc and cyclin D1 (22Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Surmacz E. Reiss K. Sell C. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4522-4525PubMed Google Scholar), two targets of β-catenin. The exact molecular mechanism of this effect has not been fully explored. Our recent discovery of a direct binding between IRS-1 and β-catenin has prompted us to investigate the mechanism(s) and the functional significance of the interaction, in the context of IGF-1R signaling. Because IRS-1 is known to interact with UBF1 (a regulator of RNA polymerase I activity), whereas β-catenin has been reported to interact with UBF2 in the cyclin D1 promoter (24Grueneberg D.A. Pablo L. Hu Q. K August P. Weng Z. Papkoff J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3936-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we also examined the possibility that IGF-1 stimulation may recruit IRS-1 and β-catenin together or separately to the cyclin D1 and the rDNA promoters. We report here that β-catenin and IRS-1 co-immunoprecipitate in nucleus and cytosol of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). IGF-1 promotes β-catenin translocation in R+ cells, where IRS-1 is also nuclear, but not in R12 cells, where IRS-1 is confined to the cytosol. The nuclear translocation of IRS-1 and β-catenin to the nuclei activates the Tc/Lef reporter. We find also that IRS-1 and β-catenin are both recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter with the UBF proteins, as already reported for β-catenin (24Grueneberg D.A. Pablo L. Hu Q. K August P. Weng Z. Papkoff J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3936-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). IRS-1, but not β-catenin, is recruited to the rDNA promoter, where it is known to bind UBF1 and stimulate the synthesis of rRNA (16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Using R12 and BT20 mammary cancer cells (25Castles G.C. Fuqua S.A. Klotz D.M. Hill S.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5934-5939PubMed Google Scholar), we show that IRS-1 is required for IGF-1-mediated nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The role of IRS-1 in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin has been confirmed by using a plasmid in which IRS-1 is expressed in fusion to a Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS). Stable expression of this plasmid in growth-regulated, contact-inhibited mouse fibroblast R12 cells (where both IRS-1 and β-catenin are normally cytoplasmic) causes both proteins to co-localize to the nuclei and induces the transformation of R12 cells into cells capable of forming colonies in soft agar (the best criteria for in vitro transformation). Although β-catenin can be translocated to the nuclei by different stimuli and pathways (see above), independently of IGF-1R signaling, these results indicate that IRS-1 can be considered one of the proteins that regulate the subcellular localization and activity of β-catenin, especially in cells responsive to the mitogenic action of IGF-1. Cells and Cell Cultures—R-cells and R–derived cells are 3T3-like cells originating from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-1R genes (26Liu J.-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). They were described in previous reports (22Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp.

For stimulation with IGF-1 (20 ng/ml), cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24-48 h before addition of IGF-1. Plasmids—The UBF1 plasmid with a FLAG tag has been described by Maiorana et al. (29Maiorana A. Tu X. Cheng G. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7116-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The UBF2 with a FLAG tag was constructed in the same manner. The mutant plasmids of β-catenin (∂C and ∂N), a kind gift of Dr. Kamel Khalili (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA), are described in the report by Gan and Khalili (30Gan D.D. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The plasmid with a nuclear localization signal was the pCMV/myc/nuc plasmid (Invitrogen). IRS-1 was cloned in the XhoI/NotI site. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—Western blots and immunoprecipitations (IPs) were carried out according to standard procedures, described in detail in previous reports from this laboratory (15Sun H. Tu X. Prisco M. Wu A. Casiburi I. Baserga R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, 20 μg of cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions was separated on a 4-14% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For immunoprecipitation, 100-200 μg of proteins was used, depending on the protein to be precipitated. Subcellular Fractionation—Cell lysates and subcellular fractionation have been described in detail in Wu et al. (31Wu A. Tu X. Prisco M. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2863-2872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The purity of the subcellular fractions was routinely monitored with appropriate antibodies to either nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins. In this latter case, the Western blot was done directly on the nuclear or cytoplasmic lysates, without immunoprecipitation. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy studies followed the same procedures described in detail in previous reports from our laboratory (16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Prisco M. Santini F. Baffa R. Liu M. Drakas R. Wu A. Baserga R. J.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7116-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The antibodies used are indicated in the appropriate figures. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were constructed using PCR products corresponding to different regions of IRS-1 coding for amino acids 1-300, 301-700, 701-1000, and 1001-1234. These regions were generated using specific oligonucleotide primers containing the appropriate restriction sites (all of the start primers contain XhoI restriction site and end primers contain EcoRI restriction sites in the overhangs). Purified PCR products were then digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into XhoI/EcoRI cloning sites of pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All plasmids constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and protein expression to guarantee accuracy and amounts of GST proteins in each reaction. The detailed cloning strategies are available upon request. Binding and elution of proteins were carried out by standard procedures. TOPFLASH Assay—The activity of β-catenin was measured using the TOPFLASH/FLOPFLASH luciferase assay (32Persad S. Troussard A.A. McPhee T.R. Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The plasmids used were the same as those reported by Korinek et al. (25Castles G.C. Fuqua S.A. Klotz D.M. Hill S.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5934-5939PubMed Google Scholar). The activity is usually determined after transient expression. We followed the procedure given in detail by Playford et al. (20Playford M.P. Bicknell D. Bodmer W.F. Macaulay V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12103-12108Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We used for transient expression the Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystem at www.amaxa.com), with which we have been obtaining high levels of transfection (70% with difficult cells like 32D cells, even higher in MEFs). Both R+ and other R- and R–derived cells were used for these experiments. ChIP Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were carried out by standard methods (33Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). Subconfluent cultures were made quiescent and then stimulated with IGF-1 (see “Materials and Methods”). Following treatment, the cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were collected and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and left on ice for 10 min. They were sonicated 4× for 10 s at 30% of maximal power (Fisher Sonic Dismembrator) and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatants were collected and diluted in 1.3 ml of IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 16.7 mm NaCl) followed by immunoclearing with 80 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 41 °C. The pre-cleared chromatin was immunoprecipitated for 12 h with specific antibodies (see below). After IP, 60 μl of salmon sperm/protein A-agarose was added and precipitation continued for 2 h at 41 °C. After pelletting, precipitates were washed sequentially for 5 min with the following buffers: wash A (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), wash B (same as wash A but with 500 mm NaCl), wash C (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). The immune complexes were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaCO3). The eluates were reverse cross-linked by heating at 65 °C for 12 h and digested with proteinase K (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h. DNA was obtained by phenol and phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol at 4 °C for 12 h, and then re-suspended in 20 μl of TE buffer. For PCR, 5 μl of each sample was used with specific primers. For the cyclin D1 promoter, chromatin was immunoprecipitated first with an antibody to β-catenin, which served as the positive control, because β-catenin is known to bind to the cyclin D1 promoter. Enrichment was detected with the primers for the Tcf sequence of the cyclin D1 promoter. The primers were the following: left, cggactacaggggagttttgttg; right, tccagcatccaggtggcgacgat (34Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar). For ChIP assays with the rDNA promoter, we used the methodology of James and Zanerdijk (35James M.J. Zomerdijk J.C.B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) but different primers, because we were dealing with a mouse rDNA promoter. The primers we used were as follows: forward P1, 5′-CCC TGT ACG TCT GAG GCC GAG-3′ (-250); rDNA promoter reverse P2, 5′-GTT AAT AGG GAA AGG ACA GCG TG-3′ (+26). We also used two other primers of the rDNA gene, located in a transcribed spacer (see text). These primers were as follows: left, gtgggtgctgcgcggctgggagt; right, accagtctttctcggtcccgtgcc. For the mouse GAPDH promoter, the primers were forward P1 (5′-AGTGCCAGCCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAATG-3) and promoter reverse P2 (5′-AAGTGGGCCCCGGCCTTCTCCAT-3′). By trial and error, we established that the best number of cycles during the PCR reaction should not be above 29 cycles. At 30-32 cycles, one could get a weak false-positive. All the data presented in this report are based on 29 cycles. The amplification products were analyzed in a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Colony Formation in Soft Agar—The methodology previously described was followed (29Maiorana A. Tu X. Cheng G. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7116-7124Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, to compare anchorage-independent growth of different cell lines, cells were plated at 2 × 103 in essential modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (plus or minus IGF-1) and 0.2% agarose (with 0.4% agarose underlay). The number of colonies larger than 125 μm in diameter was determined at 3 weeks following plating. Antibodies—The antibodies used were the following: β-catenin antibody (catalog no. MAB13291, R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN); IRS-1 rabbit polyclonal IgG (catalog no. G3003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); UBF, mouse monoclonal IgG1 (catalog no. SC-13125 Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-flag.M2-peroxidase conjugate (catalog no. a8592, Sigma); the phospho-β-catenin (Ser-33/47/Thr-41) antibody (Cell Signaling, www.cellsignal.com); anti-Grb2 monoclonal antibody (catalog no. 610111BD, BD Transduction Laboratory); c-Jun Sc4, rabbit polyclonal IgG (catalog no. F9, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); second antibody anti-IgG, mouse (SC-45, Oncogene, San Diego, CA); Second Antibody Peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure Rabbit-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch); goat anti-mouse IgG2a-FITC,(SC2079, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and donkey anti-rabbit IgG-R (SC-2095, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). IRS-1 and β-Catenin Co-immunoprecipitate in the Nuclei and Cytoplasm of R--derived Cells—Our first step was to confirm by co-immunoprecipitation the IRS-1-/β-catenin interaction we originally detected by our modified TAPtag technique (10Drakas R. Prisco M. Baserga R. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We used cell lines derived from R-cells, the original MEFs obtained from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-1R genes (26Liu J.-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). R12 cells are derived from R-cells and express 7 × 103 IGF-R/cell (27Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas R+ cells are R-cells stably transfected with a cDNA plasmid expressing the human IGF-R at high levels (28Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). R12 cells are not transformed, do not grow in serum-free medium (SFM), and do not respond to IGF-1 (22Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, IGF-1 induces in R12 cells tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and an increase in c-myc expression (22Reiss K. Valentinis B. Tu X. Xu S.Q. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Rubini M. Hongo A. D'Ambrosio C. Baserga R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). R+ cells respond to IGF-1 with cell proliferation and form colonies in soft agar (28Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We first determined in whole cell lysates of these cells the levels of expression of IRS-1, β-catenin, UBF1, and Grb2. We chose the latter two proteins because UBF1 interacts with IRS-1 and is an exclusively nuclear/nucleolar protein (36Voit R. Kuhn A. Sander E.E. Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas Grb2 is an exclusively cytoplasmic protein that can be used to monitor protein amounts in each lane of a Western blot. All four proteins are well expressed in both cell lines, regardless of whether the cells are stimulated or not with IGF-1 (data not shown). We then tested the interaction between IRS-1 and β-catenin in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Fig. 1A shows a Western blot from nuclear extracts immunoprecipitated with an antibody to β-catenin, and stained with antibodies to IRS-1 and β-catenin. The purity of the fractions was monitored with antibodies to c-Jun (a nuclear marker) and Grb2 (a cytoplasmic marker), directly on the lysates, without previous immunoprecipitation. There is interaction between the two proteins only in R+ cells, where IRS-1 is nuclear (15Sun H. Tu X. Prisco M. Wu A. Casiburi I. Baserga R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is some nuclear IRS-1 in unstimulated R+ cells. We reported before (16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that R+ cells secrete some IGF-1, which allows them to grow, albeit slowly, in SFM. The reverse immunoprecipitation experiment (with an antibody to IRS-1) is shown in Fig. 1B. Again, both proteins are detectable only in R+ cells. There is no apparent interaction between IRS-1 and β-catenin in R- and R12 cells, where IRS-1 is cytoplasmic (Ref. 16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and see below). However, Fig. 1C shows that β-catenin and IRS-1 interact in the cytoplasm of all cell lines. The same result was obtained in the reverse experiment, where cytoplasmic extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to IRS-1 and stained with antibodies to β-catenin and IRS-1 (not shown). These results confirm an interaction between IRS-1 and β-catenin, both in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of R+ cells. In R- and R12 cells, stimulated with IGF-1, the interaction is limited to the cytoplasm, in agreement with the finding that IRS-1 is not found in the nuclei of these cells. Confocal Microscopy of R--derived Cells—To confirm the IRS-1/β-catenin interaction, we studied it by confocal microscopy on R-, R12, and R+ cells. The cells were stained with antibodies to IRS-1 (red) and β-catenin (green) as shown in Fig. 2, where the merged pictures are also presented. In R-cells (here stimulated with IGF-1, to which they do not respond), both IRS-1 and β-catenin are largely cytoplasmic (panel A), although there is a little β-catenin in the nuclei. In R+ cells, before stimulation with IGF-1, most of the IRS-1 is cytoplasmic, and in fact so is most of β-catenin (panel B), although the nuclei are partially stained. After stimulation of R+ cells by IGF-1, both IRS-1 and β-catenin are much more localized to the nuclei (panel C). We show in panel C a representative field for R+ cells after stimulation with IGF-1 for 24 h (panel C), but the results were the same at 16 h. In R+ cells, nuclear localization of IRS-1 after IGF-1 stimulation reaches a peak at 16-24 h (16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In R12 cells, unresponsive to mitogenic stimulation by IGF-1, both IRS-1 and β-catenin are cytoplasmic before (panel D) or after 24 h stimulation with IGF-1 (panel E). The merged pictures clearly show the co-localization of the two proteins. It could be objected that Fig. 2 does not show a nuclear staining of the cells, to validate the subcellular localization of either IRS-1 or β-catenin. This is shown in Fig. 3, where R12 cells were stained with antibodies to IRS-1 (upper panels) or β-catenin (lower panels) and counterstained with propidium iodide (PI). Whether in SFM or after IGF-1, in R12 cells, both IRS-1 and β-catenin are essentially localized to the cytoplasm. We repeated the PI experiment with R+ and R-cells (not shown, but see Tu et al. (16Tu X. Batta P. Innocent N. Prisco M. Casaburi I. Belletti B. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44357-44365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and Sun et al. (15Sun H. Tu X. Prisco M. Wu A. Casiburi I. Baserga R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). IRS-1 Is Required for IGF-1-mediated Nuclear Translocation of β-Catenin—The next question is whether the IGF-1-mediated nuclear translocation of β-catenin requires IRS-1. For this purpose, we used BT20 cells, a breast cancer cell line that does not express IRS-1 (Castles et al. (25Castles G.C. Fuqua S.A. Klotz D.M. Hill S.M. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5934-5939PubMed Google Scholar)). Fig. 4B shows a confocal microscopy of BT20 cells, either in SFM (upper panels) or after IGF-1 stimulation. The cells were again stained with an antibody"

Deoxychalcone formation depends on chalcone synthase and chalcone reductase; however, the identity of the chalcone reductase substrate out of the possible substrates formed during the multistep reaction catalyzed by chalcone synthase remains experimentally elusive. We report here the three-dimensional structure of alfalfa chalcone reductase bound to the NADP+ cofactor and propose the identity and binding mode of its substrate, namely the non-aromatized coumaryl-trione intermediate of the chalcone synthase-catalyzed cyclization of the fully extended coumaryl-tetraketide thioester intermediate. In the absence of a ternary complex, the quality of the refined NADP+-bound chalcone reductase structure serves as a template for computer-assisted docking to evaluate the likelihood of possible substrates. Interestingly, chalcone reductase adopts the three-dimensional structure of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily. The aldo/keto reductase fold is structurally distinct from all known ketoreductases of fatty acid biosynthesis, which instead belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The results presented here provide structural support for convergent functional evolution of these two ketoreductases that share similar roles in the biosynthesis of fatty acids/polyketides. In addition, the chalcone reductase structure represents the first protein structure of a member of the aldo/ketoreductase 4 family. Therefore, the chalcone reductase structure serves as a template for the homology modeling of other aldo/keto-reductase 4 family members, including the reductase involved in morphine biosynthesis, namely codeinone reductase. 4,2′,4′,6′-tetrahydroxychalcone (chalcone) and 4,2′,4′-trihydroxychalcone (deoxychalcone) serve as precursors of ecologically important flavonoids and isoflavonoids.

The evolution of sessile terrestrial plants necessitated the acquisition of mechanisms to combat herbivore and pathogen attack (1Kenrick P. Crane P.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 33-39Crossref Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). A common defense mechanism induced in response to such challenges is chemical in nature and involves the de novo synthesis of antimicrobial compounds, collectively known as phytoalexins (2Dixon R.A. Paiva N.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar). Chalcone Synthase (CHS) 1The abbreviations used are: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHR, chalcone reductase; COR, codeinone reductase; PDB, Protein Data Bank; GOLD, genetic optimization for ligand docking; Taps, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; TIM, triose phosphate isomerase; AKR, aldo-keto reductase. and Chalcone Reductase (CHR) play key roles in the formation of an important set of phytoalexin precursors (recently reviewed in Ref. 3Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). In both legumes and non-legumes, CHS catalyzes the first committed step of flavonoid biosynthesis, forming 4,2′,4′6′-tetrahydroxychalcone (chalcone) from coumaroyl-CoA and three molecules of malonyl-CoA. This iterative multistep reaction generates linear di-, tri-, and tetra-ketide-CoA intermediates as well as a cyclic and prochiral coumaryl-trione intermediate (Fig. 1). In addition to CHS, leguminous plants possess CHR, which acts on an intermediate of the multistep CHS reaction, yielding chalcone and 4,2′,4′-trihydroxychalcone (deoxychalcone) from the coupled catalytic action of these two enzymes (Fig. 1). CHR therefore sits at a critical biosynthetic branch point that has afforded legumes with the additional ability to synthesize a set of related deoxychalcone-derived phytoalexins in response to herbivore or pathogen attack including isoflavonoids, coumestans, pterocarpans, and isoflavans (2Dixon R.A. Paiva N.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar). In addition to their activity as phytoalexins, CHR products function in the induction of symbiotic root nodulation by Rhizobium bacteria leading to nitrogen fixation (4Wojtaszek P. Stobiecki M. Gulewicz K. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 142: 689-694Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Graham T.L. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). CHR activity was first demonstrated in crude extracts of Glycyrrhiza echinata (licorice) (6Ayabe S. Udagawa A. Furuya T. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequently CHR was purified and the CHR cDNA cloned from Glycine max (soybean) (7Welle R. Schroder G. Schiltz E. Grisebach H. Schroder J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Welle R. Grisebach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To date, CHR-like enzymes have been identified in a variety of leguminous and some non-leguminous plant species, including Medicago sativa (alfalfa) (9Ballance G.M. Dixon R.A.

Planta. 1998; 205: 622-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis reveals CHR to be unrelated to known ketoreductase domains of fatty acid synthases (15Cohen-Gonsaud M.

Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1865-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Instead, CHR bears sequence similarity to aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily enzymes from primary metabolism, such as aldose reductase (21Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 3α-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (22Hara A. Matsuura K. Tamada Y. Sato K. Miyabe Y. Deyashiki Y. Ishida N. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). AKR superfamily enzymes are monomeric, (α/β)8-barrel, NAD(P)(H) binding oxidoreductases that metabolize a wide array of chemical substrates (23Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Most AKR superfamily members possess broad substrate specificities, making the unequivocal determination of the physiological function of uncharacterized AKRs difficult. As of 2004, the more than 120 AKRs identified have been classified into 14 families (24Ehrensberger A.H. Wilson D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Within the AKR superfamily, CHR, the alkaloid biosynthetic enzyme Codeinone Reductase (COR) (25Unterlinner B. Lenz R. Kutchan T.M. Plant J. 1999; 18: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and several plant oxidoreductases of poorly defined function (26Lee S.P. Chen T.H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Roncarati R. Salamini F. Bartels D. Plant J. 1995; 7: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Gavidia I. Perez-Bermudez P. Seitz H.U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2842-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) constitute the unique AKR4 family (Fig. 2). CHR and COR are the most closely related AKR4s, sharing 54% sequence identity and defining a unique clade (Fig. 2, highlighted in green). We present here the three-dimensional structure of M. sativa (alfalfa) CHR in complex with the cofactor NADP+. This structure represents the first AKR4 family member to be structurally characterized and thus serves as a starting point for the structural understanding of other AKR4 family enzymes. As proof of principle in this regard, we discuss structural insights gleaned from a COR homology model derived from our CHR structure. The CHR structure presented here provides insight into the coupled action of CHS and CHR during the CHS/CHR-catalyzed formation of deoxychalcone. The biosynthetic route to chalcone is well understood due to extensive structural and mechanistic investigations of CHS (3Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 29Ferrer J.L. Jez J.M. Bowman M.E. Dixon R.A. Noel J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), whereas the mechanistic details of deoxychalcone formation, specifically the identity of the CHR substrate, remain unknown. CHR does not reduce chalcone (30Oguro S. Akashi T. Ayabe S. Noguchi H. Abe I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Welle R. Grisebach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 263: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and CHS-mediated reduction of the thioester carbonyl of the diketide intermediate would prevent further polyketide extension by CHS, as was recently confirmed by Oguro et al. (30Oguro S. Akashi T. Ayabe S. Noguchi H. Abe I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 325: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the prevailing assumption has been that one of the two remaining linear CHS intermediates must be the CHR substrate, it has been recently noted that reduction of the prochiral cyclized trione intermediate formed through the CHS-catalyzed intramolecular Claisen condensation of the tetraketide intermediate would produce the same deoxychalcone product (Fig. 1) (3Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of CHR presented here suggests the identity of the CHR substrate, as the high quality of our structural data enables us to utilize computer-assisted docking of possible CHR substrates in order to circumstantially address the identity of the CHR substrate. Protein Expression, Purification, and Mutagenesis—M. sativa CHR (GenBank™ accession number AAB41555.1) was subcloned into the pHIS8 Escherichia coli expression vector derived from pET28a (+) (23Jez J.M. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130-132: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were incubated with shaking at 37 °C in Terrific broth (32Tartoff K.D. Hobbs C.A. Focus. 1987; 2: 12Google Scholar) containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin until A(600 nm) = 1.0. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-galactopyranoside, and the cultures were incubated with shaking at 22 °C for an additional 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 9,000 × g and cell pellets re-suspended in lysis buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol 1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 4 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. Following sonication and centrifugation of the lysed cell debris at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was passed over a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) equilibrated in lysis buffer, washed with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the His-tagged protein eluted with 10 bed volumes of elution buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The N-terminal His tag was cleaved by thrombin digestion during a 24-h dialysis against digestion buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. Cleaved protein was isolated by running the dialyzed sample over another Ni2+-NTA column equilibrated in digestion buffer to remove the His tag and uncleaved protein, followed by a benzamidine-Sepharose column to remove thrombin. A Superdex S75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (500 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol) was utilized to isolate homogeneous and monomeric CHR. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed against crystallization storage buffer (100 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol). The resulting CHR sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and judged to be >95% pure based upon Coomassie staining. The sample was subsequently concentrated to 18 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization—CHR crystals were grown overnight by vapor diffusion at 4 °C in 2.0-μl drops, consisting of 1 μl of crystallization reservoir (28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m MgCl, 100 mm Taps (pH 8.5), 6-10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μl of protein solution (350 μm CHR, 5 mm NADPH). Prior to freezing at 105 K, crystals were soaked for 3 min in cryoprotectant (28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m MgCl, 100 mm Taps (pH 8.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol), diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline FIP on a Mar345 Image Plate (MarResearch GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). CHR crystallized in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 74.3 Å, b = 85.9 Å, c = 103.9 Å, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled to 1.45 Å with HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). CHR was co-crystallized under the same conditions with 5 mm of the putative substrate analog, 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid. Diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9-2 on a Quantum 4 CCD detector. CHR crystallized in space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), a = 74.5 Å, b = 85.8 Å, c = 103.8 Å, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit.

The search model was generated with Modeler (34Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) using the structure of human type III 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PDB accession number 1IHI) as a template. Given the documented variability in the A, B, and C loops of AKR family members, these loop regions were removed in our search model. It was necessary to rotate one monomer of the original molecular replacement solution ∼90° to relieve steric clashes between symmetry mates. The 4-fold pseudo-symmetry of the CHR Triose Phosphate Isomerase (TIM)-barrel enabled this near-correct solution. The initial CNS molecular replacement model was manually adjusted and completed by model building in O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) and refined using CNS (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The CHR·NADP+ complex had 91.9, 8.1, 0.0, and 0% of residues in the most favored, allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. Main chain and side chain structural parameters were well above average with a G factor of 0.39 (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The final structural coordinates and structure factors were deposited to the Protein Data Bank under PDB accession number 1ZGD. Automated Substrate Docking—Genetic Optimization for Ligand Docking (GOLD) was employed for automated docking of putative substrates into the CHR active site (38Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5392) Google Scholar). GOLD optimizes the fitness score of many possible solutions using a genetic algorithm. Parameters controlling the precise operation of the genetic algorithm were as follows: population size (100), selection pressure (1.100000), number of operations (100,000), number of islands (5Graham T.L. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), niche size (2Dixon R.A. Paiva N.L. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (3631) Google Scholar), crossover weight (95), mutate weight (95), and migrate weight (10Sallaud C. el-Turk J. Bigarre L. Sevin H. Welle R. Esnault R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 869-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The default parameter values for van der Waals and hydrogen bonding were used throughout the docking process. Because of the known catalytic mechanism of AKR superfamily enzymes, whereby a hydride from the nicotinamide C4 is transferred to the substrate carbonyl carbon for reduction, all docking calculations imposed a constraint requiring the C6 atom of coumaryl-trione to be within 2.5-4 Å of nicotinamide ring C4 and between 3.5 and 5 Å of nicotinamide ring C3. These restraints effectively impose a distance restraint on one of the two trione carbonyls that can be reduced as there is free rotation around the C6-C7 bond. Prior to aromatization, the six-membered ring is prochiral at C6 and non-planar, adopting either a modified boat or chair conformation; therefore, the C1 and C5 carbonyls are not equivalent (Fig. 3). Imposing a carbonyl carbon-nicotinamide C4 distance constraint on either of the carbonyls would bias the calculation. Fifty docking calculations were run for each ligand, and the GOLD score was used to identify the lowest energy docking results. Purification and Crystallization—Alfalfa CHR was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal octahistidine-tagged fusion protein and purified via Ni2+-NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography. CHR crystallized in the presence of a 14-fold molar excess of the NADP+ cofactor with or without 5 mm 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid. CHR crystals diffracted to 1.70 Å. Molecular replacement with a CHR homology model based on the structure of human 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PDB code 1IHI) and phase extension to high resolution yielded experimental electron density maps of excellent quality revealing a molecule of NADP+ bound to the CHR cofactor binding site of each molecule in the asymmetric unit. No additional electron density corresponding to 4,6-dioxoheptanoic acid was observed. Iterative rounds of model building and refinement of the two molecules of CHR in the asymmetric unit yielded a final CHR structure exhibiting well defined electron density for all but the first five residues (Table I). We investigated crystal soaking as well co-crystallization strategies of CHR with an additional set of substrate and product analogs. Several promising data sets were collected but failed to exhibit any additional electron density corresponding to a bound ligand near or within the active site encompassing the NADP+ cofactor/product. Overall Structure—The three-dimensional fold of CHR is that of an (α/β)8-barrel, with eight parallel strands lining the interior of the α/β-barrel and eight helices packing along the outside of the β-strands (Fig. 4A). The barrel is closed at the N-terminal end by a β-hairpin. This (α/β)8 pattern is disrupted by the insertion of two additional helices following α8 (A1) and between β7 and β8 (A2). The additional α-helices pack together along the outer barrel. This pattern of an (α/β)8-barrel plus two additional α-helices was first observed in TIM and is often referred to as a TIM-barrel (39Banner D.W. Bloomer A. Petsko G.A. Phillips D.C. Wilson I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 72: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The C-terminal end of the TIM barrel is open but partially shielded by five loops. In the AKR superfamily, these A, B, and C loops are critical for substrate specificity (24Ehrensberger A.H. Wilson D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Two shorter loops, namely β1α1 and β2α2, contribute key active site residues (Fig. 4B). Despite the low sequence identity when comparing CHR to other AKRs, CHR clearly exhibits an α/β structural core nearly identical to human 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (1.089 Å root mean square deviation for PDB accession code 1j96, (41Nahoum V. Gangloff A. Legrand P. Zhu D.W. Cantin L. Zhorov B.S. Luu-The V. Labrie F. Breton R. Lin S.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42091-42098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) and human and porcine aldose reductases (1.299 Å root mean square deviation for PDB code 1ef3, (42Oka M. Matsumoto Y. Sugiyama S. Tsuruta N. Matsushima M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2479-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)). However, the CHR three-dimensional structure bears some striking differences within the loop regions responsible for substrate recognition in the AKR superfamily (Fig. 4C). Unlike other structurally characterized AKR family members, the tip of the CHR β1α1 loop points toward the B loop, forming a clamp near the diphosphate portion of the bound NADP+ cofactor. The A loop bends toward the central C-terminal opening of the TIM barrel. Specifically, Phe-130 and Phe-133 located at the top of the A loop and His-120 and Trp-121 residing at the base of the A loop project inward in the direction of the active site situated in the center of the TIM barrel. The B loop of CHR is considerably shorter than structurally related AKRs, resulting in a more spacious opening of the TIM barrel near the C terminus. Finally, the top portion of the C loop also bends inward toward the center of the TIM barrel. Notably, Pro-301 orients downward and faces the active site defined by the bound NADP+ cofactor. Pro-301, together with Trp-89, Trp-121, Phe-130, Phe-132, and Ile-298 contribute to the overall hydrophobicity of the active site. Nicotinamide Cofactor Binding Site—The experimental electron density map clearly shows a molecule of the oxidized nicotinamide cofactor, namely NADP+, bound to the active site of each CHR monomer in the asymmetric unit of the CHR crystal. As in all structurally characterized members of the AKR superfamily described to date, NADP+ is sequestered in an extended anti-conformation within a small tunnel at the C-terminal end of the barrel, with the nicotinamide group protruding down into the core of the TIM barrel and the adenine moiety lying between the C-terminal ends of β7 and β8 (24Ehrensberger A.H. Wilson D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Jez J.M. Bennett M.J. Schlegel B.P. Lewis M. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 43Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). The A-face of the nicotinamide moiety is solvent exposed, consistent with transfer of the pro-R C4 hydride of NADPH to the substrate carbonyl carbon (43Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The B-face of the nicotinamide moiety interacts with the π-electrons of Phe-214 through a face-to-face stacking interaction. Notably, the aromatic nature of this stabilizing interaction is conserved in other AKRs, which typically maintain a Tyr at this position (Fig. 5). The central diphosphate portion of the NADP+ molecule lies in the tunnel defined by the β1α1 loop (residues 30-32) and the B loop (residues 220-223, Fig. 4B). Subtle differences in residue identities and hydrogen bonding patterns occur across AKR subfamilies. As this is the first example of an AKR4 family structure, the CHR coordinates will be valuable tools for the investigation of AKR4 family NADPH binding sites. The CHR tunnel is unique in that the β1α1 and B loops clamp down tightly over the NADP(H) molecule, forming a narrow tunnel that translates toward the adenine moiety relative to other AKRs (Fig. 4C). Perhaps this tight clamp compensates for the fact that, like the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase subfamily, CHR lacks the “safety belt” of salt bridges over the NADP(H) molecule found in aldose and aldehyde reductases (43Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 44el-Kabbani O. Judge K. Ginell S.L. Myles D.A. DeLucas L.J. Flynn T.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A quantitative examination of the thermodynamics of NADP(H) binding and an investigation of CHR kinetic parameters will be necessary to define the physiological relevance of this seemingly tight structural clamp. Active Site Architecture—The active site is formed at the C-terminal end of the TIM-barrel with the nicotinamide moiety and site of hydride transfer lying at the base of the catalytic cavity. The active site surface is defined by residues contributed from t"

For some members of the family, it was shown that this reduction occurs via a reduced flavodoxin in E. coli (25Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol.

In the next step the reduced iron-sulfur cluster transfers an electron to AdoMet, which subsequently is cleaved to methionine and a reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (27Magnusson O.T. Reed G.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some AdoMet radical reactions, AdoMet is consumed and acts as a co-substrate with release of methionine and 5′-deoxyadenosine (34Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ugulava N.B. Frederick K.K. Jarrett J.T.

In others, AdoMet is restored and acts as a true cofactor (22Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 506-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Cheek J. Broderick J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2860-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Based on the current knowledge about AdoMet radical enzymes a potential HemN mechanism, shown in Scheme 1c, was proposed (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The solved HemN crystal structure provided insights into the corresponding enzyme and cofactor architecture. Nevertheless, a crystal structure represents only a single static, sometimes even artificial, view of a protein. Therefore, several functional questions concerning the proposed HemN mechanism remained to be answered. The redox reaction performed by the [4Fe-4S] cluster is the crucial initial step of radical generation. The HemN crystal structure revealed the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster ligated by the three cysteine residues of the conserved CXXXCXXC amino acid motif and by carboxyl and amino groups of the methionine part of AdoMet. We have investigated the properties of the iron-sulfur cluster in this protein in solution by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy. These are very sensitive techniques for the observation of structurally different forms of the cluster in solution. The characteristics of the cluster in the [4Fe-4S]2+ state were determined using Mössbauer spectroscopy. There, the influence of AdoMet and the substrate on the coordination of the cluster were of interest. A central step in the proposed mechanism for HemN catalysis is the homolytic cleavage of AdoMet and radical formation, which initiates the decarboxylation of the propionate side chains of the substrate coproporphyrinogen III. In the case of HemN two consecutive decarboxylations are catalyzed to form the reaction product protoporphyrinogen IX. The crystal structure revealed the presence of two bound AdoMet molecules. Therefore, AdoMet cleavage was analyzed for its stoichiometry, turnover number, and possible AdoMet regeneration, and the influence of the substrate on AdoMet cleavage was investigated. Finally, the function of the second AdoMet molecule (AdoMet2), which is unique to the solved HemN crystal structure, was investigated via site-directed mutagenesis of the involved conserved amino acid residues. Mutant proteins were tested for their overall structural integrity and iron-sulfur cluster stability, AdoMet cleavage, and catalytic activity. Obtained results allow for a deeper and exemplary understanding of the structure-function-relationships for this AdoMet radical enzyme. Materials—All chemicals were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Merck Eurolab (Darmstadt, Germany). Coproporphyrin III was purchased from Paesel+Lorei GmbH & Co. (Hanau, Germany) and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine ([14C]AdoMet) from Amersham Biosciences. 57Fe (96% enriched) was purchased from Chemotrade GmbH (Düsseldorf, Germany). 5-Deazaflavin was a gift from Dr. K. Ibrom (Department of Chemistry, Technical University, Braunschweig). Preparation of 57FeCl3—22 mg of metallic 57Fe were dissolved in 377 μl of HCl (37%, w/v) at 80 °C. The obtained 57FeCl3 solution was then added dropwise to 17 ml of 600 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, pH 5.2, under continuous stirring. During this procedure, the pH was held between 3 and 5 by adding 2 m NaOH. The resulting 17.5-ml solution was added to 10 liters of culture medium. Site-directed Mutagenesis of E. coli HemN—The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Employed oligonucleotides were for HemN Y56A, CCTGAGCGTCCATTATCTCTCGCCGTACATATCCCG; for Y56L, CCTGAGCGTCCATTATCTCTCTTGGTACATATCCCG; for E145A, GCGGAGATTTCGATCGCAGTCGATCCGC; for E145I, GCGGAGATTTCGATCATAGTCGATCCGCGGG; for F310A, GCGTGCTGCATCGTAACGCCCAGGGCTACACC; for F310L, GTGCTGCATCGTAACTTGCAGGGCTACACC; for Q311A, GCATCGTAACTTCGCGGGCTACACCACTCAGGGC; and for I329A, GGCGTTTCCGCCGCCAGCATGATTGGCGACTGC. Exchanged nucleotides are underlined. All mutated genes were subjected to complete DNA sequence determination. Purification of E. coli HemN—Recombinant E. coli HemN wild-type and mutant proteins were purified anaerobically as previously described (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Some of the mutant HemN enzymes (Y56A, Y56L) were purified using a modified affinity chromatography protocol. Glycerol in a concentration of 10% (v/v) increased their affinity to the material in a batch purification approach. For Mössbauer spectroscopy 57Fe was incorporated into HemN by growing E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pET3ahemN on minimal SMM-medium (37Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Modern Microbiological Methods: Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1990: 584Google Scholar, 38Benda R. Mössbauerspektroskopische Untersuchungen an Hämmodell-komplexen und Eisen-Schwefel-Proteinen. Shaker Verlag, 2002: 80Google Scholar) containing 31 μm 57Fe. Purification of Thermosynechococcus elongatus Protoporphyrinogen IX Oxidase—Recombinant T. elongatus protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase was produced as a His-Tag fusion protein in E. coli BL21-Codon-Plus(DE3)-RIL cells carrying vector pET-32ahemY. Protein production was induced at A578 of 0.6 with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 500 μm). After induction, cells were grown overnight at 25 °C. Purification was performed using the MagneHis™ Protein Purification System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After purification, the protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to remove imidazole. Determination of Protein Concentration—The BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay kit (Sigma), and the Bio-Rad protein assay were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Iron Determination—The iron content of recombinant, purified E. coli HemN was determined colorimetrically with o-phenanthroline as previously described (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). UV-visible light absorption spectroscopy for the detection of the [4Fe-4S] cluster was also carried out as described before (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Coproporphyrinogen III Oxidase Activity Assay Using Recombinant HemN—The oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase activity assay for wild-type and mutant HemN proteins was performed as described before (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the investigation of AdoMet cleavage during HemN catalysis and determination of the methionine/protoporphyrinogen IX ratio, the reaction was performed with slight modifications. [14C] AdoMet (specific activity of 53.6 mCi/1.98 GBq per mmol) was used instead of non-labeled AdoMet. The concentrations in the assay mixtures were 1.5 μm HemN, 160 μg of E. coli cell-free extract (S250), 20–30 μm [14C]AdoMet, 500 μm NADH, and 20 μm coproporphyrinogen III in a total volume of 300 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. The mixtures were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C in the dark. After 15, 30, 60, and 90 min of incubation, 50-μl samples were taken from the assay mixture for the determination of protoporphyrinogen IX and methionine formation. Enzymatically formed protoporphyrinogen IX was oxidized by addition of T. elongatus protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase (final concentration 3 μm), and the amount of protoporphyrinogen IX was determined by fluorimetric detection of its oxidized form protoporphyrin IX using a PE LS50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described before (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the determination of methionine formation, the proteins in the assay mixture were precipitated by addition of 10% (w/v) PCA and removed by centrifugation. Methionine formation was determined by HPLC analysis of the supernatant as described below. Assay for AdoMet Cleavage—HemN-mediated AdoMet cleavage was studied in the presence and absence of the substrate coproporphyrinogen III. For this purpose the assay was performed as described above in the presence and absence of the substrate. Alternatively, the assay was performed without E. coli cell-free extract. In this case sodium dithionite served as the reductant for the iron-sulfur cluster of HemN, and the concentrations were 40 μm HemN, 2 mm sodium dithionite, 80 μm [14C]AdoMet, and 140 μm coproporphyrinogen III in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. The mixtures were incubated at 18 °C for 3 h in the dark. For the investigation of AdoMet cleavage by the mutant proteins, the assay was carried out using [14C]AdoMet with the following assay composition: 10 μm HemN (wild-type or mutant HemN), 80 μm [14C]AdoMet, 2 mm dithionite, 100 μm coproporphyrinogen III in a total volume of 25 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. All mixtures for testing mutant proteins were incubated anaerobically at 37 °C in the dark for 90 min. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10% (w/v) PCA, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. Formation of [14C]methionine was determined by HPLC analysis of the supernatant. HPLC Analysis—The samples for HPLC analysis were prepared as described above. After removal of the precipitated proteins the solution was filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). 20 μl of the sample were loaded onto a 4.6 × 250-mm ODS Hypersil-C18 reversed phase column (Techlab GmbH, Erkerode, Germany) with a pore width of 120 Å. Separation was performed at 38 °C at a flow rate of 500 μl/min using 50 mm NH4H2PO4 (pH 2.5) as mobile phase. [14C]AdoMet and [14C]methionine were detected by measurement of radioactivity using a flowthrough scintillation counter (Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH, Straubenhardt, Germany) and in parallel by photometric diode array analysis at 200–650 nm. For the quantification of the enzymatically formed methionine, 250-μl fractions were collected, and amounts of [14C]AdoMet and [14C]methionine were determined using a Liquid Scintillation Analyzer Tri-Carb 2900 TR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The scintillation mixture employed was OptiPhase HiSafe 2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The HPLC system employed was Jasco 1500 (Jasco, Gross-Umstadt, Germany). [14C]AdoMet and l-methionine (Sigma) were used as standards. Preparation of EPR Samples—Samples for EPR were prepared under strict anaerobic conditions and contained 160 μm HemN, 10 mm sodium oxalate, and 50 μm 5-deazaflavin in a total volume of 250 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 3 mm DTT, and 300 mm NaCl. For reduction of the iron-sulfur cluster the samples were illuminated for 1 h using a commercial slide projector. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen directly after illumination. EPR Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were obtained at X-band using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 liquid helium cryostat. Acquisition conditions are given in the figure legend. Spin intensities were quantitated by double integration and calibrated against a sample of known concentration of copper (2+) sulfate/EDTA. Preparation of Samples for Mössbauer Spectroscopy—For Mössbauer spectroscopy the final HemN concentration was 760 μm. Sample preparation was performed under strict anaerobic conditions. For the sample containing HemN plus AdoMet a 10-fold molar excess of AdoMet (7.5 mm) over HemN (760 μm) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 18 °C. In the sample of HemN plus AdoMet and substrate, the concentrations were 570 μm HemN, 5 mm AdoMet, and 500 μm coproporphyrinogen III. This sample was incubated for 2 h at 18 °C. The solutions were transferred to 400-μl Mössbauer cups and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mössbauer Spectroscopy—Mössbauer spectra were recorded using a spectrometer in the constant acceleration mode. Isomer shifts are given relative to α-Fe at room temperature. The spectra obtained at 20 mT were measured in a He-bath cryostat (Oxford MD 306) equipped with a pair of permanent magnets. These spectra were analyzed by least-square fits using Lorentzian line shape. For the high-field spectra (4 T) a cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet was used (Oxford Instruments, Spectromag 4000). These spectra were simulated by the nuclear Hamiltonian in Equation 1.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Analysis of Wild-type and Mutant HemN— For CD measurements, protein solutions were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, and 10 mm NaCl. CD spectra of protein samples (0.125 mg/ml) in quartz cuvettes of 1-mm path length were recorded as an average of ten scans with a Jasco J810 spectropolarimeter over a range of 200–250 nm on a millidegree ellipticity scale. Dialysis and measurements were carried out under anaerobic conditions. The reduction and oxidation of the iron-sulfur cluster is the initial critical step of HemN catalysis. Previously, the cluster of recombinant, anaerobically purified E. coli HemN was spectroscopically identified using UV-visible light absorption spectroscopy (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the solved HemN crystal structure one view of the coordination chemistry of the cluster was obtained (5Layer G. Moser J. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.-D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6214-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, questions regarding the properties of the reduced cluster in the [4Fe-4S]1+ state remained. Moreover, the functional change in the coordination sphere of the cluster in response to the binding of AdoMet and the substrate were of interest. To answer these questions and further characterize the detailed functional nature of the iron-sulfur cluster of E. coli HemN in solution, we performed EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopic investigations. Such spectroscopic investigations in combination with the data obtained from the x-ray crystallographic study (5Layer G. Moser J. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Schubert W.-D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6214-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) allow a very precise description of the electronic and structural properties of the iron-sulfur cluster of HemN. EPR Spectrum of the HemN Iron-Sulfur Cluster Reduced in the Absence of S-Adenosylmethionine—HemN (2 mol of iron/mol HemN) at a concentration of 160 μm was reduced with oxalate/deazaflavin and light as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures” and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectrum of the reduced (oxalate/deazaflavin) enzyme in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine produces an EPR spectrum (Fig. 1, trace a) at 15 K typical of a [4Fe-4S] center with g values g1 = 2.06, g2 = 1.94, g3 = 1.89. Quantitation of the number of spins (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicates that they are not stoichiometric given the concentration of the enzyme, with ∼20% of the iron-sulfur centers in the enzyme contributing to the signal observed. This results from a combination of incomplete reduction of the iron-sulfur center, and incomplete incorporation of the cluster into all HemN molecules during overexpression of the protein (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34136-34142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As reported previously (4Layer G. Verfürth K. Mahlitz E. Jahn D. J. Biol.

Therefore, HemN was used as isolated containing 2 mol of iron/mol HemN for all experiments, assuming, after the results of EPR and Mössbauer studies, that half of the protein population was in the apo form and the other half in the holo form carrying a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The EPR spectrum of the iron-sulfur center at 15 K also app"

The manner in which the NMDAR regulates one of these pathways, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) pathway, is currently unknown. In the present study, we have defined a developmental-, concentration-, and time-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of p38. In cultured hippocampal neurons 7-8 days in vitro (DIV7-8), NMDAR stimulation leads to a concentration-dependent increase in p38 phosphorylation (phospho-p38). However, in more mature neurons (>DIV17) application of NMDA produces concentration-dependent effects, such that low concentrations result in sustained increases in phospho-p38 levels, and high concentrations dephosphorylate p38 within 5 min. Conantokin G, an antagonist of NR1/2A/2B and NR1/2B receptors, inhibits p38 phosphorylation, while NR1/2B-specific antagonists prevent the rapid dephosphorylation of p38 without affecting p38 activation. Furthermore, inhibition of calcineurin prevents the activation of p38, whereas inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevents the rapid dephosphorylation of p38. Our results support the presence of subtype-dependent pathways regulating p38 activation and deactivation: one involves NR1/2A/2B receptors activating calcineurin and resulting in p38 phosphorylation, and the other utilizes NR1/2B receptors binding to and activating PI3K and leading to the dephosphorylation of p38 in a manner involving both NR1/2A/2B receptor activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B. The ability of NMDAR subtype-specific mechanisms to regulate p38 has implications for NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity, gene regulation, and excitotoxicity.

Differential responses mediated through NMDAR stimulation can be caused by the level of activation, the localization of the effect, or by the properties of the receptor.

During maturation, expression of NR2A subunits increases, and NR2A-containing receptors, bound to post-synaptic density (PSD)-95, predominate in the synapse, whereas NR1/2B receptors become mostly extrasynaptic with SAP102 levels decreasing at the synapse (6Sans N.

NMDAR composition changes similarly in primary culture, in which immature cultures contain mostly NR2B subunits, and NR2A expression increases by 14 days in vitro (DIV) (11Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mature hippocampal cultures, synaptic NMDARs are mainly NR1/2A/2B receptors bound to PSD-95, and NR1/2B receptors are largely located extrasynaptically (11Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using pharmacological inhibitors show that differences in receptor subtype composition and localization convey distinct properties to NMDAR function in this in vitro system (2Lynch D.R. Guttmann R.P. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Several downstream targets of NMDAR stimulation may be differentially regulated by NMDAR subtype composition and localization (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lynch D.R. Guttmann R.P. Curr. Drug Targets. 2001; 2: 215-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some of these pathways are mediated by calmodulin, which activates calcineurin, calmodulin-activated protein kinase II (CaMKII), and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS). In addition, NMDAR stimulation activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). These kinases act on a variety of substrates and play crucial roles in gene regulation (through activation of transcription factors such as the cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB), cell death, and synaptic plasticity (12Cammarota M.

However, p38 also controls the physiological processes of gene regulation through activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) and of synaptic plasticity through initiation of long term depression (LTD) and inhibition of long term potentiation (LTP) of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor currents (16Zhu J.J.

Therefore, p38 is important in both excitotoxic mechanisms and physiological synaptic regulation.Whereas the importance of NMDAR-mediated p38 activation has been established, the mechanisms by which NMDAR activation controls p38 phosphorylation are undefined. Characterizing these mechanisms could provide important information about both normal physiology and dysregulation during disease states. In the present study, we have identified subtype-dependent control of p38 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by NR1/2A/2B receptors and NR1/2B receptors, respectively, and defined the pharmacological properties and messenger systems involved in each pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESHippocampal Primary Culture—Cultures were prepared from the hippocampus of 18-19-day old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (E18-E19) as previously described (28Wilcox K.S. Buchhalter J. Dichter M.A. Synapse. 1994; 18: 128-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hippocampi from rat embryos were trypsinized (0.027%, 37 °C, 7% CO2 for 20 min) and then washed with Hank's-buffered saline solution (HBSS). The tissue was triturated in warm media (10% defined, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% Hams F12 medium, and 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with penicillin/streptomycin), and cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 viable cells per 35-mm culture dish or similar relative density onto 6-well or 12-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates. Neurons were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with neurobasal media containing B27. Cultures, which include a heterogeneous mixture of pyramidal and nonpyramidal hippocampal neurons, were maintained for at least 17 days in vitro (>DIV17) prior to experimentation, unless otherwise indicated, and are referred to as mature cultures. Immature hippocampal cultures were maintained for 7-8 days in vitro (DIV7-8).Incubation in NMDAR Agonists and Selective Antagonists—Cultures were preincubated with inhibitors for 1 h prior to treatment. All inhibitors were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise indicated, and included MK801 (1 μm), Ro25-6981 (10 μm), zinc (500 nm), conantokin G (ConG; 6 μm; generous gift from Drs. Francis Castellino and Mary Prorok, Notre Dame), FK506 (1 μm; generous gift from Dr. Ted Dawson, Johns Hopkins University), KN62 (10 μm), 7-nitroindazole (7NI; 100 μm), LY294002 (100 μm; Tocris Cookson, Balwin, MO), ifenprodil (1 μm), dantrolene (10 μm), wortmannin (10 nm and 100 nm), and SB203580 (1 μm). We also utilized a combination of voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) inhibitors, nifedipine (2 μm), ω-agatoxin IVa (30 nm), and ω-conotoxin GVIA (100 nm). FK506, KN62, 7NI, and LY294002 were dissolved in Me2SO, and experiments involving these inhibitors were compared against a Me2SO control of 1:1000 dilution. Although dantrolene, wortmannin, nifedipine, ω-agatoxin IVa, and ω-conotoxin GVIA were also dissolved in Me2SO, the maximal concentration of Me2SO for these experiments was 1:5000, which did not affect the phosphorylation levels of p38. NMDA treatment included 10 μm glycine and NMDA (10, 30, 50, or 100 μm) in neurobasal media with B27 with or without applicable inhibitors. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 during preincubation and treatment. After treatment, media were removed from cultures, and cells were immediately scraped into 1.5× Laemmli SDS sample buffer.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analyses were performed and analyzed by methods previously described (29Guttmann R.P. Baker D.L. Seifert K.S. Cohen A. Coulter D.A. Lynch D.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to phospho-p38 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were utilized to detect activation of p38 in these samples. Antibodies specific to phospho-ATF-2 (1:1000), phospho-ERK1/2 (1:3000), and total p38 (1:1000; all from Cell Signaling Technology) were also used. To determine levels of phospho-Y1336-NR2B, an antibody specific to that phosphorylation site (1:2000, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was utilized, and immunoreactivity was standardized to total amount of NR2B receptor detected with an NR2B-specific antibody (AB1557; 1:1000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Primary antibody incubation was followed by mouse monoclonal horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:2500; Cell Signaling Technology for total p38, and 1:5000; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME for phospho-ERK1/2) or rabbit polyclonal horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactivity was visualized using ECL reagent (Pierce) and exposure on x-ray film. Bands were quantitated using densitometry normalized to total p38 or total NR2B immunoreactivity. Phospho-p38 and phospho-ATF-2 levels were expressed as a fraction of immunoreactivity observed in cells treated with 10 μm NMDA for 5 min in neurons, and phospho-Y1336-NR2B levels were expressed as a fraction of immunoreactivity observed at baseline.Statistical Analyses—Multiple comparisons were analyzed by ANOVA, with two-way post-hoc Bonferroni corrections completed when applicable. Unpaired Student's t test was used to directly compare values of two groups where multiple comparisons were not performed. For two-way comparisons with significantly different variances, data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests. Statistical significance was determined by a p value of <0.05, computed using InStat by GraphPad Software (San Diego, CA).Calcium Imaging—Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured on glass-bottom dishes at relative low to medium density at 2 × 105 per 35-mm plate, and Ca2+ imaging was performed using a Nikon microscope in conjunction with Metafluor imaging software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA), as previously described (30Lynch D.R. Shim S.S. Seifert K.M. Kurapathi S. Mutel V. Gallagher M.J. Guttmann R.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 416: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Imaging was visualized using Fura 2-AM. Data represent the mean of individual cell responses, compiled from a minimum of 2-3 individual experiments with 7-61 cells per experiment. Data are expressed as a change in intracellular calcium transients, the difference between the noted time point and the baseline (0 min) intracellular calcium levels.Immunofluorescence—Primary hippocampal neurons were plated onto glass coverslips at low to medium density, and experiments were performed at 21 days in vitro (DIV 21). After treatment, cells were immediately fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. After blocking with 10% horse serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, coverslips were incubated overnight with antibodies specific to phospho-p38 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology), NR2B (1:500, Chemicon International), and MAP2 (1:200, generously provided by Dr. Virginia Lee, University of Pennsylvania) in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:200, Jackson Laboratory) in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were mounted using Vectorshield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent pictures were taken using a Leica DM IRE2 HC fluo TCS 1-B-UV microscope coupled to a Leica TCS SP2 spectral confocal system/UV. The scan head contains an AOBS, acoustal-optical tunable filter, for simultaneous control of up to 6 laser lines. The 3 fluorochromes were sequentially scanned with all conditions at identical exposures, with a green HeNe (543 nm/1.2 milliwatt), the 488-nm line of blue argon (458 nm/5 mV 488 nm/20 milliwatt; 514/20 milliwatt) and blue diode (405 nm/20 milliwatt) laser. Each picture is representative of 6-12 samples.Coimmunoprecipitation—Primary hippocampal cultures were plated at high density on to 60-mm plates, and all experiments were performed from DIV 21-24. After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (RIPA) (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-Cl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem, division of EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Cell lysates were preincubated for 2 h with protein G beads to remove nonspecific binding, prior to addition of antibody. The following antibodies were utilized: NR2B (Upstate Biotechnology), NR2A (Chemicon International), and p85-PI3K (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Each incubation received the same amount of protein (∼200 μg) from pooled samples. After an overnight incubation, protein G beads were utilized to pull-down the antibody of interest, and beads were subsequently washed four times with RIPA buffer. Samples were electrophoresed onto a 6% SDS-PAGE gel and probed with the following antibodies: NR2B (Chemicon International), NR2A (Upstate Biotechnology: 06-313 antibody), NR1 (Chemicon International), p85-PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology), and phospho-Y1336-NR2B (Upstate Biotechnology).RESULTSControl of p38 Activation by NMDA Receptors—In other neuronal systems, 5-15-min treatments with 100 μm glutamate or 100 μm NMDA increase p38 phosphorylation and thus activate p38 in an NMDAR-dependent fashion (17Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18518-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 31Mukherjee P.K.

To identify the optimal concentration of NMDA for phosphorylating p38, we treated hippocampal cultures maintained for at least DIV17 (mature cultures) for 5 min with varying concentrations of NMDA and 10 μm glycine and detected the active state of p38 using an antibody specific to the double phosphorylated form of p38 (Thr180/Tyr182). 5-min treatment with 10 and 30 μm NMDA increased p38 phosphorylation ∼10-fold over baseline, but higher concentrations of NMDA reduced p38 phosphorylation, such that 100 μm NMDA treatment did not increase phospho-p38 levels above baseline (Fig. 1A). No differences were observed in total p38 between different conditions, and pretreatment with MK-801, a specific NMDAR antagonist (32Wong E.H. Kemp J.A. Priestley T. Knight A.R. Woodruff G.N. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7104-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar), prevented p38 activation, indicating that phosphorylation of p38 with lower concentrations of NMDA required NMDAR activation.To understand this concentration-dependent phenomenon and to determine if 100 μm NMDA can activate p38 at other time points, we examined the time course of p38 activation, comparing low and high concentrations of NMDA. 100 μm NMDA treatment resulted in peak p38 activation at 1 min that returned to baseline levels by 5 min, whereas 10 μm NMDA treatment resulted in relatively sustained activation with a peak at ∼2.5 min (Fig. 1B). As no changes in total p38 and no appearance of breakdown products of either phospho-p38 or total p38 were noted, the decrease with 100 μm NMDA likely reflected a rapid dephosphorylation of p38. In contrast, phospho-p38 levels treated with 10 μm NMDA decreased only slightly over 30 min and did not return to baseline. To rule out endogenous glutamate release or downstream effects of neurotransmission resulting from NMDAR activation and neuronal depolarization as the cause of p38 activation/deactivation, we inhibited neurotransmission with 1 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX). TTX did not significantly alter p38 phosphorylation with either 10 or 100 μm NMDA treatment (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, neither inhibition of calcium release from intracellular calcium stores with dantrolene nor inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), using a combination of nifedipine (2 μm), ω-agatoxin IVa (30 nm), and ω-conotoxin GVIA (100 nm), altered p38 phosphorylation with either 10 or 100 μm NMDA (Fig. 1C), supporting the possibility that signals originating specifically from the NMDAR-controlled p38 phosphorylation.One possible explanation for the acute decrease in phospho-p38 levels with 100 μm NMDA in mature cultures could be a decline in NMDAR-mediated intracellular calcium transients in the presence of 100 μm NMDA. To rule out this possibility, we measured the temporal course of the NMDAR-mediated intracellular calcium response with low and high concentrations of NMDA. 100 μm NMDA treatment resulted in peak intracellular calcium changes by 30 s that were sustained through 5 min of treatment (Fig. 1D). 10 μm NMDA treatment increased intracellular calcium levels rapidly over 30 s to only one-third of the peak observed with 100 μm NMDA, followed by a decrease over 5 min of treatment. Therefore, the decreased activation of p38 after 5 min of 100 μm NMDA treatment was not because of a loss of the NMDAR-mediated intracellular calcium response.Because NMDAR composition and localization change over the first 2 weeks in culture (11Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stocca G. Vicini S. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we explored p38 activation in less mature cultures. Previous reports suggest that 100 μm NMDA treatment results in a more sustained increase in phospho-p38 levels in less mature hippocampal cultures (31Mukherjee P.K. DeCoster M.A. Campbell F.Z. Davis R.J. Bazan N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6493-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In DIV7-8 hippocampal cultures (immature cultures), NMDAR activation caused a concentration-dependent increase in phospho-p38 production that was completely blocked by 1 μm MK-801 pretreatment (Fig. 2A). Comparing the concentration-dependent data for both ages of cultures showed that the patterns of p38 phosphorylation between the two ages of cultures were distinct, with the decrease with higher concentrations of NMDA observed only in mature cultures (Fig. 2B). To prove that the p38 pathway, and not just p38, was activated in this concentration- and development-dependent manner, we used an antibody specific to phosphorylated ATF-2, which is downstream of p38 in this signal transduction pathway in neurons (34Shimokawara T. Yamada E. Masui K. Mishima K. Enomoto Y. Inoue K. Sakaki T. Ichijima K. Neuropathology. 2002; 22: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 35Puig B. Vinals F. Ferrer I. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 2004; 107: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ATF-2 increased in a concentration-dependent fashion in immature cultures, and decreased with higher concentrations of NMDA in mature cultures, matching the results observed with phospho-p38 (Fig. 2C). To verify that ATF-2 is downstream of NMDAR-activated p38, we utilized the p38 inhibitor SB203580. p38 inhibition significantly reduced phospho-ATF-2 immunoreactivity in the presence of 10 μm NMDA in both immature and mature cultures (Fig. 2D). Therefore, NMDAR-mediated p38 activation led to phosphorylation of ATF-2 in this system, and this concentration-dependent, developmental phenomenon affected the entire p38 pathway.Fig. 2p38 phosphorylation with immature (DIV7-8) hippocampal cultures. A, representative immunoblot of phospho-p38 and total p38 and quantification of NMDAR-mediated p38 activation with increasing concentrations of NMDA. Cultures were exposed to NMDA and 10 μm glycine treatment for 5 min with or without 1 μm MK-801 pretreatment. MK-801 significantly inhibited phospho-p38 production in all conditions (p < 0.0001 by ANOVA, #, p = 0.002 by Mann-Whitney test for the 10 μm NMDA condition, and *, p < 0.001 for 30, 50, and 100 μm NMDA conditions, by post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni corrections; compiled from four experiments). B, comparison of response to increasing NMDA concentrations between DIV7-8 cultures and cultures maintained for at least DIV17, using data indicated in Fig. 1A and Fig. 2A. C, quantification of phosphorylated ATF-2 using specific antibody to phospho-ATF-2 (represents three experiments for each age of culture). Comparison of phospho-ATF-2 levels for immature and mature cultures. The effects of NMDA concentration on phospho-p38 levels are also noted in control of its downstream transcription factor, indicating that phosphorylation of p38 and activity of p38 both depend on concentration of NMDA and developmental course. D, 1 μm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38, was used to show that phospho-ATF-2 is downstream of p38 activation. In both immature and mature hippocampal cultures SB203580 significantly decreased NMDAR-mediated phospho-ATF-2 activation with 10 μm NMDA treatment. *, p < 0.0001 by two-tailed Student's t test compiled from 4-5 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NMDAR Subtype Dependence of p38 Phosphorylation—Developmental changes in hippocampal cultures include synaptic NMDAR composition changes from NR1/2B to NR1/2A/2B, and an increase in the number of extrasynaptic NR1/2B receptors (11Tovar K.R.

Recently, several missense mutations in the protein kinase Cγ (γPKC) gene have been found in different SCA14 families. To elucidate how the mutant γPKC causes SCA14, we examined the molecular properties of seven mutant (H101Y, G118D, S119P, S119F, Q127R, G128D, and F643L) γPKCs fused with green fluorescent protein (γPKC-GFP). Wild-type γPKC-GFP was expressed ubiquitously in the cytoplasm of CHO cells, whereas mutant γPKC-GFP tended to aggregate in the cytoplasm. The insolubility of mutant γPKC-GFP to Triton X-100 was increased and correlated with the extent of aggregation. γPKC-GFP in the Triton-insoluble fraction was rarely phosphorylated at Thr514, whereas γPKC-GFP in the Triton-soluble fraction was phosphorylated. Furthermore, the stimulation of the P2Y receptor triggered the rapid aggregation of mutant γPKC-GFP within 10 min after transient translocation to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of the mutant γPKC-GFP caused cell death that was more prominent than wild type. The cytotoxicity was exacerbated in parallel with the expression level of the mutant. These results indicate that SCA14 mutations make γPKC form cytoplasmic aggregates, suggesting the involvement of this property in the etiology of SCA14.

Sci. 2001; 22: S88-S92Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Schols L. Bauer P. Schmidt T. Schulte T. Riess O. Lancet Neurol. 2004; 3: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The genes involved and the responsible mutations have been identified in several types of SCAs. Among these, CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions are commonly found in seven types (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17 and DRPLA) (1Mariotti C. Di Donato S. Neurol. Sci. 2001; 22: S88-S92Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Schols L. Bauer P. Schmidt T. Schulte T. Riess O. Lancet Neurol. 2004; 3: 291-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Diseases caused by such expansions, including Huntington disease and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), are called polyglutamine diseases (3Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 4Everett C.M. Wood N.W. Brain. 2004; 127: 2385-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The aggregation of mutant proteins having an abnormally elongated polyglutamine tract is considered to be the molecular basis of neuronal degeneration in polyglutamine diseases (5Ikeda H. Yamaguchi M. Sugai S. Aze Y. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Recently, six different missense mutations in protein kinase Cγ (γPKC) gene (PRKCG) have been found in SCA14 families (6Chen D.H. Brkanac Z. Verlinde C.L. Tan X.J. Bylenok L. Nochlin D. Matsushita M.

Five mutations are located in exon 4, encoding the C1B region in the regulatory domain of γPKC, and one mutation is in exon 18, encoding the C terminus of the catalytic domain of γPKC (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we found a novel mutation in a Japanese SCA14 family (Fig. 1, bold lined box). 2K. Hiramoto, H. Kawakami, K. Inoue, T. Seki, H. Maruyama, H. Morino, M. Matsumoto, K. Kurisu, and N. Sakai, submitted data. Because mutations associated with SCA14 affect highly conserved amino acids among the PKC family members, it is possible that these mutations disturb the fundamental function or conformation of γPKC. However, how these mutations cause cerebellar degeneration remains controversial. PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases which plays important roles in signal transduction and the regulation of various cellular functions. Among PKC subtypes, γPKC is specifically present in the central nervous system and is especially abundant in cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells (10Saito N. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Tanaka C. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 369-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, γPKC is thought to be involved in various neuronal functions including synaptic plasticity and memory via modulating long term potentiation and long term depression (11Saito N. Shirai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 683-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). γPKC knock-out mice showed mildly impaired motor coordination and incomplete developmental elimination of synapses between Purkinje cell and climbing fibers (12Chen C. Kano M. Abeliovich A. Chen L. Bao S. Kim J.J. Hashimoto K. Thompson R.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1233-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Kano M. Hashimoto K. Chen C. Abeliovich A. Aiba A. Kurihara H. Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1995; 83: 1223-1231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in model mice of SCA1 overexpressing mutant ataxin-1 with elongated polyglutamine, γPKC was down-regulated and abnormally localized to the cytoplasmic vacuoles in Purkinje cells (14Skinner P.J. Vierra-Green C.A. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 905-913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that γPKC may be involved in SCA. Previous live imaging studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PKC (PKC-GFP) demonstrated that PKCs are translocated to several cellular organelles in an isoform- and stimulation-specific manner when PKCs are activated by different stimulations. Thereafter, PKCs recognize and phosphorylate their substrates at the targeted subcellular regions and cause the subsequent cellular responses (PKC targeting). This PKC targeting is considered to be the molecular basis underlining the multiplicity of PKC-mediated functions. Using transgenic mice overexpressing γPKC-GFP, we have recently reported that the translocation of γPKC-GFP, which was induced by the electrical stimulation of parallel fibers, propagated along the dendritic shaft of the cerebellar Purkinje cells (15Sakai N. Tsubokawa H. Matsuzaki M. Kajimoto T. Takahashi E. Ren Y. Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Matsubayashi H. Chen J. Duman R.S. Kasai H. Saito N. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating that PKC targeting is prerequisite for various PKC-involved neuronal functions in Purkinje cells. γPKC is a member of the classical PKCs (cPKCs), which are activated by diacylglycerol (DG) and Ca2+ in the presence of phosphatidylserine (16Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). γPKC has C1 and C2 domains, which bind DG and Ca2+, respectively (17Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4038) Google Scholar), in its regulatory domain (Fig. 1). The C1 domain of γPKC is subdivided into two cysteine-rich repeats (C1A and C1B), both of which bind with DG and phorbol ester with high affinity (18Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 19Irie K. Nakahara A. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Fukuda H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kashiwagi K. Saito N. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The C1 and C2 domains have crucial roles in PKC targeting through binding to these PKC activators (20Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As described above, 6 of 7 missense mutations found in SCA14 families are located in the C1B domain of γPKC (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is possible that these missense mutations influence the targeting of γPKC. In the present study, to elucidate how mutant γPKCs induced the neuronal degeneration and the pathology of SCA14, we focused on PKC targeting. We expressed mutant γPKC-GFP in culture cells and compared its localization and receptor-mediated translocation with those of wild type. Materials—ATP was purchased from Research Biochemical International (Natick, MA). Anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody, Alexa546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody and Alexa633-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Anti-phospho-γPKC (Thr514), anti-phospho-γPKC(Thr655) and anti-phospho-γPKC(Thr674) polyclonal antibodies were from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-γPKC polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Plasmid Construction—Human γPKC cDNA was cloned from a human cDNA library by PCR and subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutant human γPKC cDNAs were constructed by using QuickChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To construct the plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant γPKC-GFP, γPKC and GFP cDNAs were together subcloned into the expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The GFP cDNA followed the γPKC cDNA so that GFP protein was fused with the C terminus of γPKC. All wild-type and mutant γPKC cDNAs were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture—The CHO-K1 cell strain was a gift from Dr. Nishijima (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Immunoblotting—Plasmids (5 μg) were transfected into CHO cells (2 × 105 cells) by lipofection using the Fugene™6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfected CHO cells were spread onto 6-cm diameter dishes and cultured for 2 days. Cells were harvested by 500 × g centrifugation, followed by washing with 1 ml of homogenate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). For preparing total cell fractions, cells were resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 100 nm calyculin A, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and sonicated (UR-20P, TOMY SEIKO, Tokyo, Japan) (output, 4; duty, 50%) for 15 times at 4 °C. For immunoblotting, the same amounts (10–20 μg) of samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites on PVDF filters were blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk in PBS-T (0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.03% Triton X-100) for >1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, the PVDF filters were incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:2000) or anti-phospho-PKCγ (Thr514) polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1000) for >1 h at room temperature. After further washing, the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (diluted 1:10,000) for >30 min at room temperature. After three more washes, the immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents, Amersham Biosciences) The band densities were quantified with Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). For preparing Triton-soluble (S) and -insoluble (I) fractions, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (homogenate buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 100 nm calyculin A) and sonicated. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as the S fraction. The pellets were resuspended with 50 μl of RIPA buffer, sonicated, and used as the I fraction. One-twentieth volume of each fraction was subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted by the same method as described above. Observation of γPKC-GFP Localization—CHO cells (1×105 cells) were spread onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass bottom culture dishes (Mat-Tek Corp., Ashland, MA) and were transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid by lipofection. Transfected cells were cultured for 2 days until the observation. After the culture medium was replaced with 1 ml of HEPES buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3), the fluorescence of GFP was monitored with a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (LSM510META, Carl Zeiss, Esslingen, Germany) at 488-nm argon laser excitation using a 505–530-nm band pass barrier filter. To analyze the expression level of wild-type or mutant γPKC-GFP in individual cells, fluorescence images of randomly selected CHO cells expressing γPKC-GFPs were obtained. For this purpose, parameters of confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope (e.g. pinhole, laser intensity, and sensitivity of fluorescence) were adjusted to the same level. The fluorescence intensity and the area of the whole cell were measured using LSM510META software. The fluorescence intensity per area (FI/A) was used as an index for estimating the expression level of γPKC-GFPs in each cell. Fluorescent Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Analysis—Circular regions in the cytoplasm of CHO cells expressing mutant γPKC-GFP were photobleached by scanning for 15 s with an argon laser of the highest power. Before and after photobleaching, the bleached cells were monitored for 30 min. Observation of γPKC-GFP Translocation—Wild-type or mutant γPKC-GFP-transfected CHO cells were cultured in glass bottom dishes for 2 days until observation. After the culture medium was replaced with 0.9 ml of HEPES buffer, the GFP fluorescence was monitored with a confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscope. Translocations of GFP-fused proteins were triggered by a direct application of 0.1 ml of ATP solution at 10× higher concentration into HEPES buffer to obtain the appropriate final concentration. Images were recorded every 5 s for 5–10 min before and after the stimulation. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Immunostaining and Staining with Golgi Complex Marker—Two days after transfection, CHO cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for more than 30 min. After washing twice with PBS-T, the cells were treated with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum (NGS) for 5 min at room temperature. For immunostaining, the cells were then incubated with the anti-γPKC polyclonal antibody (1:1000) and 5% NGS in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. After three times washing with PBS-T, the cells were incubated with Alexa546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500) and 5% NGS in PBS-T for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS-T. For staining with Golgi complex marker, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml Alexa633-conjugated WGA and 5% NGS in PBS-T for 40 min at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS-T. The fluorescence of Alexa546 and Alexa633 was observed with a confocal scanning fluorescent microscope at 543-nm and 633-nm HeNe laser excitation using a 560-nm and 650 nm-long pass barrier filter, respectively. Evaluating and Counting Cells with Aggregation—CHO cells transfected with γPKC-GFP were cultured for 2 days and fixed as described above. After two washes with PBS, cells were observed using fluorescent microscopy. We classified cells expressing γPKC-GFP into three types: cells without aggregation, with massive aggregations, and with dot-like aggregations (Fig. 2, A–C). We evaluated the cell type and counted the number of each cell type in 50–60 GFP-positive cells Analyzing Cell Death Using Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometric analyses were conducted using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). We used 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences) as a marker for dead cells. Transfected CHO cells were cultured on 6-cm diameter dishes for 3 days. Cells were isolated with 0.125% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA, washed three times, and suspended in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 140 mm NaCl and 2.5 mm CaCl2. We added 5 μl of 50 μg/ml 7-AAD into 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl of HEPES buffer and incubated cells for 10 min at room temperature. Stained cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry at a 488-nm argon laser excitation using a 515–545-nm band pass barrier filter for GFP and 650-nm long pass filter for 7-AAD. For each sample, the fluorescence of 2 × 104 cells was recorded and analyzed by the Cell Quest™ software (BD Biosciences). Mutant γPKC-GFPs Tended to Aggregate in CHO Cells—Six different missense mutations (5 around the C1 domain and 1 in the catalytic domain) have been reported in the γPKC gene in different SCA14 families (Fig. 1). Recently, we found a novel mutation around the C1 domain (Ser119 replaced with Phe) of γPKC in a Japanese SCA family (Fig, 1, bold lined box).2 To clarify how these mutations affect the molecular properties of γPKC and trigger neurodegeneration, we introduced these missense mutations into γPKC-GFP and investigated molecular properties of 7 mutant γPKC-GFPs (H101Y, G118D, S119P, S119F, Q127R, G128D, and F643L) expressed in CHO cells. Most of the CHO cells expressing wild-type γPKC-GFP had a ubiquitous GFP fluorescence in the cytoplasm, but not in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, cells expressing mutant γPKC-GFP frequently had aggregated GFP fluorescence in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, B and C). Precise observation revealed that there were two patterns of mutant γPKC-GFP aggregation, massive aggregation and dot-like aggregation as described in Fig. 2, B and C, respectively. Massive aggregation was seen in the vicinity of the nucleus (Fig. 2B), whereas dot-like ones were seen in cytoplasm (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we classified aggregation patterns into these two types. We evaluated the extent of γPKC-GFP aggregations in 50–60 GFP-positive CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant γPKC-GFP. Results are shown in Fig. 2D. Although wild-type γPKC-GFP aggregations were observed in 20.9 ± 2.7% of expressed cells, all seven mutants were preferably aggregated, and the percentage of cells having aggregation was over 30%. In six mutants (G118D, S119P, Q119F, Q127R, G128D, and F643L), the percentages were significantly greater than that in wild-type γPKC-GFP. In cells expressing H101Y, S119F, and F643L mutant γPKC-GFPs, massive aggregations were more often observed than in cells expressing wild type, whereas G118D, S119P, Q127R, G128D, and F643L mutants more frequently formed dot-like aggregations than wild type (Table I). Similar massive and dot-like aggregations were observed when γPKC-GFPs were expressed in other cell lines such as COS-7 and SH-SY5Y cells (data not shown).Table IProperties of WT and mutant γPKC-GFPs found in the present study Results are represented as mean ± S.E. except aggregation after translocation, which is indicated as observed cells/examined cells.WTH101YG118DS119PS119FQ127RG128DF643LCells havingAggregates20.9 ± 2.732.7 ± 6.841.4 ± 5.6ap < 0.0160.2 ± 6.4bp < 0.00135.0 ± 5.2cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)49.8 ± 2.7bp < 0.00156.9 ± 11.9ap < 0.0145.6 ± 4.3bp < 0.001Massive aggregates14.4 ± 1.724.0 ± 4.3cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)27.0 ± 6.420.5 ± 4.928.6 ± 5.2cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)16.3 ± 2.027.9 ± 7.428.5 ± 2.2bp < 0.001Dot-like aggregates (% of total γPKC-GFP expressing cells)6.5 ± 1.48.7 ± 2.914.4 ± 1.5ap < 0.0139.7 ± 3.6bp < 0.0016.4 ± 0.733.5 ± 2.7bp < 0.00129.0 ± 5.8ap < 0.0117.1 ± 2.7ap < 0.01Phosphorylation level atThr514100 ± 4.468.5 ± 10.755.1 ± 5.4ap < 0.0126.2 ± 2.9bp < 0.00155.1 ± 2.4bp < 0.00188.0 ± 22.143.2 ± 3.4bp < 0.00129.6 ± 8.0ap < 0.01Thr655100 ± 8.774.4 ± 4.578.2 ± 13.953.5 ± 10.9cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)76.3 ± 4.984.0 ± 12.046.8 ± 7.6ap < 0.0165.5 ± 8.0cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)Thr674 (% of WT)100 ± 0.879.4 ± 3.2ap < 0.0170.3 ± 13.945.7 ± 6.8ap < 0.0159.1 ± 8.5ap < 0.0159.3 ± 12.5cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)37.7 ± 2.9bp < 0.00132.8 ± 8.2ap < 0.01Insolubility toTriton X.100 (% of expressed γPKC-GFP)60.6 ± 8.974.3 ± 6.782.7 ± 5.791.2 ± 2.6cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)52.1 ± 17.193.3 ± 1.7cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)94.3 ± 1.0cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)92.6 ± 1.7cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)Translocation induced by ATP (1 mm)Retained period at the plasma membrane (seconds)129.4 ± 23.2114.4 ± 25.0137.7 ± 9.395.0 ± 13.1bp < 0.00191.5 ± 8.1123.3 ± 7.7123.3 ± 9.1117.5 ± 12.4Aggregation after the translocation (observed cells/examined cells)0/90/95/110/70/106/9dp < 0.01 versus WT (Fisher's exact test)7/9dp < 0.01 versus WT (Fisher's exact test)0/8Dead cells inTotal GFP(+) cells20.0 ± 0.820.3 ± 1.922.3 ± 1.331.5 ± 2.5cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)23.5 ± 1.525.5 ± 1.8cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)26.5 ± 2.525.5 ± 2.2Low GFP cells14.6 ± 0.211.7 ± 2.012.8 ± 1.317.1 ± 3.113.1 ± 1.914.6 ± 2.015.6 ± 2.515.9 ± 1.0High GFP cells (% of GFP(+) cells)32.2 ± 1.037.1 ± 1.640.9 ± 2.3cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)56.9 ± 0.9bp < 0.00152.7 ± 1.6cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)43.1 ± 4.247.1 ± 3.1cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)45.0 ± 3.2cp < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)a p < 0.01b p < 0.001c p < 0.05 versus WT (unpaired Student's t test)d p < 0.01 versus WT (Fisher's exact test) Open table in a new tab To exclude the possibility that the aggregate formation of γPKC-GFPs depends on their excessive expression, but not on the properties of mutated proteins, we investigated the relationship between the expression level and the aggregate formation of γPKC-GFP. In CHO cells expressing wild type and S119P and G128D γPKC-GFPs, fluorescent images of randomly selected 30–40 cells were obtained using the same parameters of confocal laser scanning microscope. The fluorescence intensity per area (FI/A), which represents the mean of the fluorescence intensity throughout the cell, was used as an index exhibiting the expression level of γPKC-GFPs in each cell. In Fig. 3A, histograms show the distribution of cells with or without aggregation classified by γPKC-GFP expression level. In wild-type γPKC-GFP, all cells with FI/A <100 did not have any aggregation (0/23 cells). Aggregations were observed only in cells with FI/A >100 (7/12 cells). In contrast, in S119P and G128D mutant γPKC-GFPs, aggregations were frequently observed in cells whose FI/A were 20–100 (22/25 cells in S119P and 19/26 cells in G128D). Fig. 3B shows the representative images of cells expressing wild-type and mutant (S119P and G128D) γPKC-GFPs with FI/A 40–60, indicating that the expression levels of γPKC-GFPs were similar among these three cell types. Although wild-type γPKC-GFP was uniformly expressed in the cytoplasm, mutant γPKC-GFPs formed dot-like aggregation in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the susceptibility to aggregate formation of mutant γPKC-GFPs is determined by their properties, but not by their expression level. Next, we examined whether massive and dot-like aggregation of γPKC-GFP were colocalized with cellular organelles. The massive aggregation of wild-type γPKC-GFP was strongly colocalized with the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a Golgi complex marker (Fig. 4A). However, the massive aggregation of mutant γPKC-GFP was partially colocalized with WGA (Fig. 4B). This result indicates that massive aggregation of mutant γPKC-GFP was qualitatively different from that of wild type. In the case of dot-like aggregations, we could not establish colocalization of these aggregations with markers for Golgi complex, lysosome, or early or late endosomes (data not shown). To elucidate whether γPKC-GFP irreversibly formed dot-like aggregates, we performed a FRAP study. A γPKC-GFP aggregation was photobleached with an argon laser at 488 nm, followed by observing fluorescence recovery. As shown in Fig. 5, an application of photobleaching into a circular area around dot-like aggregations (a and b) abolished the fluorescence of γPKC-GFP aggregation, and the GFP fluorescence was not recovered, at least within 30 min. In contrast, the fluorescence of non-aggregated γPKC-GFP (Fig, 5c) was recovered to a level similar to that in the unbleached cytoplasm within 1 min after photobleaching (Fig. 5d). This result indicates that mutant γPKC-GFP of dot-like aggregation tightly associates each other and that the aggregates were not exchangeable with free γPKC-GFP in the cytoplasm. To exclude the possibility that the addition of GFP to the γPKC was critical for aggregate formation, we expressed mutant γPKC alone in CHO cells. We attempted to immunostain mutant γPKCs with anti-γPKC antibody. To confirm whether this antibody could properly detect the aggregation of γPKCs, CHO cells expressing mutant γPKC-GFP were stained with this antibody. As shown in Fig. 6A, the γPKC immunofluorescence detected with this antibody is consistent with the S119P γPKC-GFP fluorescence, although the antibody only recognized edges, not centers, of massive aggregations of S119P γPKC-GFP (upper panels, arrows). In contrast, the antibody recognized the whole of dot-like aggregations (lower panels, arrowheads). These results suggest that the anti-γPKC antibody properly recognizes γPKC-GFP aggregation, although it might be inaccessible to the centers of these aggregations. As shown in Fig. 6B, both massive (arrow) and dot-like (arrowheads) aggregations were also observed in CHO cells expressing S119P γPKC. In contrast, wild-type γPKC rarely aggregated in CHO cells (data not shown). This result indicates that the addition of GFP to γPKC is not critical for the aggregate formation of mutant γPKC. Phosphorylation Level and Solubility to Triton X-100 of Mutant γPKC-GFP Was Decreased—γPKC has three phosphorylation sites in its kinase domain: activation loop (Thr514), turn motif (Thr655), and hydrophobic motif (Thr674) site (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of these three sites is necessary for the full activation of PKC in response to various stimulations (21Hofmann J.

We examined whether the aggregate formation affected the phosphorylation level of these three sites by immunoblotting with each phosphospecific antibody. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table I, the phosphorylation levels of mutant γPKC-GFPs were significantly decreased or tended to be decreased at"
https://openalex.org/W1991084862,"The human gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor is evolutionarily configured for high affinity binding of GnRH I ([Tyr(5),Leu(7),Arg(8)]GnRH) but at lower affinity for GnRH II ([His(5),Trp(7),Tyr(8)]GnRH). GnRH I is more potent in the activation of the G(q/11) protein in the gonadotrope; however, GnRH II is more potent in the stimulation of apoptosis and antiproliferative effects through activating G(i) protein-mediated signaling, implying that GnRH I and II selectively stabilize different receptor-active conformations that preferentially couple to different signaling pathways. Receptor activation involves ligand induction or conformational selection, but the molecular basis of the communication between ligand-binding sites and receptor allosteric sites remains unclear. We have sought conformational coupling between receptor-ligand intermolecular interactions and intramolecular interaction networks in the human GnRH receptor by mutating remote residues that induce differential ligand binding affinity shifts for GnRH I and II. We have demonstrated that certain Ala mutations in the intracellular segments of transmembrane domains 3 (Met(132)), 5 (Met(227)), 6 (Phe(272) and Phe(276)), and 7 (Ile(322) and Tyr(323)) of the human GnRH receptor allosterically increased ligand binding affinity for GnRH II but had little effect on GnRH I binding affinity. We examined the role of the three amino acids that differ in these two ligands, and we found that Tyr(8) in GnRH II plays a dominant role for the increased affinity of the receptor mutants for GnRH II. We propose that creation of a high affinity binding site for GnRH II accompanies receptor conformational changes, i.e.""induced fit"" or ""conformational selection,"" mainly determined by the intermolecular interactions between Tyr(8) and the receptor contact residues, which can be facilitated by disruption of particular sets of receptor-stabilizing intramolecular interactions. The findings suggest that GnRH I and II binding may selectively stabilize different receptor-active conformations and therefore different ligand-induced selective signaling described previously for these ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2048325346,"The major stress protein transcription factor, heat shock factor (HSF1), is tightly regulated through a multilayered activation-deactivation process involving oligomerization, post-translational modification, and interaction with the heat shock protein (Hsp90)-containing multichaperone complex. Conditions of proteotoxic stress, such as heat shock, trigger reversible assembly of latent HSF1 monomers into DNA-binding homotrimers that bind with high affinity to cognate heat shock elements. Transactivation is a second and independently regulated function of HSF1 that is accompanied by hyperphosphorylation and appears to involve a number of signaling events. Association of HSF1 with Hsp90 chaperone complexes provides additional regulatory complexity, however, not all the co-chaperones have been identified, and the specific molecular interactions throughout the activation/deactivation pathway remain to be determined. Here we demonstrate that protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a tetratricopeptide domain-containing component of Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes, functions as a negative modulator of HSF1 activity. Physical interactions between PP5 and HSF1-Hsp90 complexes were observed in co-immunoprecipitation and gel mobility supershift experiments. Overexpression of PP5 or activation of endogenous phosphatase activity resulted in diminished HSF1 DNA binding and transcriptional activities, and accelerated recovery.

The highly conserved transcription factor HSF1 is the key regulatory protein responsible for the up-regulation of Hsp expression in higher eukaryotes (1Morimoto R. Tissiers A. Georgopoulos C.

The mechanism of HSF1 regulation is highly complex, involving multifactorial control by phosphorylation, cellular compartmentalization, and protein-protein interaction with chaperone complexes. It is not yet known how these multiple layers of control are integrated to result in cellular regulation of HSF1 and the stress response. HSF1 exists under normal conditions as non-DNA-binding monomers, poised for rapid conversion to homotrimers with high affinity DNA binding activity to the heat shock elements in Hsp gene promoters (4Baler R.

This oligomeric switching involves rearrangement of hydrophobic interactions between 3 hydrophobic heptad repeats distributed along the HSF1 molecule (4Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

Acquisition of transcriptional competence is a second independent step in the stress-activation process that is regulated through a central regulatory region (9Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell.

Although hyperphosphorylation is generally associated with increased transcriptional activity, elucidating the effect of specific phosphorylation on HSF1 activity is proving to be a complicated task. Several kinases have been reported to phosphorylate HSF1 on specific residues and either enhance or repress its activities, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (11Holmberg C.I.

The role of Hsp90 chaperone complexes on transcription factor regulation has been most extensively characterized in the experimental model of steroid receptor maturation (23Riggs D. Cox M.

Hsp90 is the key molecular chaperone in mature receptor complexes together with p23 and one of the immunophilins (Cyp40, FKBP51, or FKBP52). Assembly of steroid receptor complexes is a highly dynamic process involving Hsp70 and accessory chaperones Hsp40, Hip, and Hop (24Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Bull. Exp. Biol.

Our laboratory has examined HSF1 regulation by Hsp90 in the Xenopus oocyte model system, and reported HSF1 interaction with multiple components of the Hsp90 foldosome (18Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hsp90, P23, and FKBP52 remain associated with the activated HSE binding HSF1 complex (20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Conversion to monomers after heat shock was accelerated by overexpression of Hsp90, Hsp70, Hip, and Hop and delayed by cyclophilins (Cyp-40, FKBP51, and FKBP52). HSF1 was activated in the absence of heat shock by microinjection of Abs against Hsp90 and p23, and microinjected Abs against several of the co-chaperones also affected the DNA-binding properties of HSF1. Further evidence supporting Hsp90-mediated control of HSF has been reported in yeast (25Duina A.A. Kalton H.M. Gaber R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18974-18978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The precise molecular interactions and specific roles of individual components of the Hsp90 foldosome in regulating trimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity, at each stage of the HSF1 activation/deactivation pathway, has not yet been determined. However, the initial studies with HeLa cells and Xenopus oocytes suggest that the multichaperone interactions that may regulate HSF1 share common features with the steroid receptor maturation pathway (22Nair S.C.

PP5 is a 58-kDa member of the PPP family of serine/threonine protein phosphatases that contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain not found in other members of this family. The N-terminal TPR domain of PP5 functions both to inhibit the C-terminal phosphatase domain and to mediate interactions with the MEEVD domain of Hsp90 (33Yang J. Roe S.M. Cliff M.J. Williams M.A. Ladbury J.E. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Hsp90 activates PP5 by disrupting TPR-phosphatase domain interactions, permitting substrate access to the active phosphatase domain (33Yang J. Roe S.M. Cliff M.J. Williams M.A. Ladbury J.E.

Here we investigate the potential interaction of PP5 with HSF1-Hsp90 complexes, and subsequent regulation of HSF1 activities. Oocyte Manipulations—Xenopus laevis oocytes were obtained, fractionated, and microinjected as described previously (14Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29147-29152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Chemical stresses were performed for 2 h at 18 °C with the specified concentration of chemical stressors. Oocytes were treated for 2 h with 4 μm fostriecin (Calbiochem), or 100 nm okadaic acid (Sigma) at 18 °C prior to further experimentation as indicated. In all experiments, a minimum of 25 oocytes were used for each sample, and each experiment was performed using oocytes from the same batch. Plasmid DNAs for microinjection were as follows: pCMV-PP5 (43Chinkers M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11075-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), pCMV-PP5Flag, pET30-K97A, and pET-R101A (26Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In some experiments, oocytes were microinjected into the nucleus with 7.5 milliunits of PP1 or PP2A (Calbiochem catalog numbers 539527 and 539508) and then incubated for 1 h at 18 °C prior to further experimentation. Protein Extracts and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—DNA mobility shift assays were performed by using radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes as described previously (44Ovsenek N. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Heikkila J.J. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For gel mobility supershift analysis, Abs were added into DNA binding reactions at a final dilution of 1:100 (v/v). DNA binding activity was quantified using NIH Image (version 1.6.1) software, and results were expressed in arbitrary densitometry units as a percentage of the signal obtained in DNA binding reactions from uninjected untreated, heat-shocked controls. Antibodies—Abs used for gel mobility shift analysis and Western blotting were as follows: anti-Hsp90 monoclonal Ab (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, catalog number SPA-830), anti-PP5 polyclonal Ab (M. Chinkers, University of South Alabama), anti-p23 monoclonal Ab (clone JJ3; gift from D. Toft, Mayo Graduate School), anti-FKBP52 monoclonal Ab (clone Hi52c gift from D.

Immunoblotting—Protein extracts were fractionated as described (14Xavier I.J. Mercier P.A. McLoughlin C.M. Ali A. Woodgett J.R. Ovsenek N. J. Biol.

Secondary Abs were goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad catalog number 70–5045) or anti-mouse (Bio-Rad catalog number 170–5044), diluted 1:10,000 in TBST and 2.5% (w/v) milk. Blots were then washed in TBST and developed for peroxidase activity using chemiluminescence (Renaissance system, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation (IP)—IPs were performed using the modified method of Firestone and Winguth (45Firestone G.L. Winguth S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 688-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as described (20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Oocyte cell extracts for IP reactions were prepared using TETN-250 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 250 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). IP reactions contained 4 oocyte equivalents in TETN-250 in a total volume of 200 μl, with a 30-μl bed volume of protein A/G-Sepharose resin (Amersham Bio-sciences, catalog number 17-0469-01). IPs were carried out for 30 min at 23 °C with 2 μl of pre-absorbed IP Ab. Following reactions, resin was washed with TETN-250 (6 × 0.5 ml), bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and aliquots were analyzed by Western blotting. Transcription Assays—Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays were performed as previously described (18Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PP5 Reduces HSF1 DNA Binding upon Heat Shock—To determine the potential role of PP5 in HSF1 regulation, oocytes were microinjected with pCMV6-PP5 (26Chen M.S. Silverstein A.M. Pratt W.B. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32315-32320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which codes for rat PP5 under control of the constitutively active CMV promoter. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A) showed steadily increasing quantities of plasmid-derived PP5 over the time course of incubation, with a substantial increase relative to endogenous PP5 seen after 12 h of expression. Heat shock did not affect steady state levels of either endogenous or recombinant PP5, nor did overexpression of PP5 have any effect on the levels of HSF1, before or after heat shock. The heat-inducible activation of HSF1 oligomerization/DNA binding was compared in uninjected controls and PP5 expressing (12 h) oocytes by EMSA (Fig. 1B). The amount of HSF1-HSE complex formation was significantly reduced in PP5 expressing oocytes relative to controls. DNA binding activity of other transcription factors such as CAAT box transcription factor (Fig. 1B, lower panel) or SP1 (data not shown) were not affected by expression of exogenous PP5, ruling out a general suppressive effect on DNA binding activities in the oocyte. HSF1 activation was compared in oocytes expressing PP5 for 3, 6, or 12 h prior to heat shock (Fig. 1C). The reduction of HSF1 activation was proportional to the amount of exogenous PP5, suggesting a direct link between increased PP5 concentrations and HSF1 regulation. The relative reduction in HSF1 DNA binding activity was more prominent at the early phases of heat shock. After 60 min of heat shock, HSF1-HSE complex formation relative to controls was reduced by 20% in all samples, suggesting that lengthy heat shock diminished the impact of PP5 on activation. We next tested the effect of PP5 overexpression on the induction of HSF1 by chemical stresses. HSF1 activation was reduced in PP5 expressing oocytes in response to salicylate, arsenite, cadmium, and ethanol treatments (Fig. 1D). Subcellular Localization of PP5—We next compared the subcellular localization of endogenous and plasmid-derived PP5 in control and microinjected oocytes (Fig. 2). Endogenous PP5 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm with low but detectable amounts in a single oocyte nucleus. Heat shock resulted in modest reproducible translocation of PP5 into the nucleus (lanes 5 and 6). Exogenous PP5 expressed from microinjected pCMV-FLAG-PP5 behaved similarly to endogenous PP5, both in relative distribution and nuclear translocation induced by heat shock. The total mass of the nucleus is ∼5% of the whole cell, and longer film exposure revealed the presence of FLAG-tagged PP5 in the nucleus prior to heat shock (data not shown). Controls using the cytoplasmic marker IκB and the nuclear marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen demonstrate the purity of subcellular fractions. PP5 Interaction with HSF1—HSF1 is an exclusively nuclear protein in oocytes (35Mercier P.A. Foksa J. Ovsenek N. Westwood J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14147-14151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and detection of nuclear PP5 made plausible a physical interaction between these proteins. Co-IP experiments were performed to test for interaction between endogenous PP5 and HSF1. Co-IP of PP5 using an Ab against HSF1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), and reciprocal pull-down of HSF1 using an Ab against PP5 (lanes 10 and 11) was observed, confirming a physical interaction between PP5 and HSF1 in oocytes. These interactions were detected in unshocked and heat-shocked samples with no consistent or reproducible difference observed in the co-IP signal after heat shock. This suggests that PP5 is a component of Hsp90 heterocomplexes with both inactive monomeric and activated trimeric HSF1. The protein-protein association here is presumably through interaction between the TPR domain of PP5 and the C terminus of Hsp90, although it remains possible that PP5 could interact directly with HSF1. Control IP reactions with unrelated Abs failed to bring down PP5 or HSF1 in both non-shocked or heat-shocked oocytes (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–9 and 12–18). We examined whether exogenous plasmid-derived PP5 in microinjection experiments associates with HSF1 in a similar manner as endogenous PP5. Co-IP of FLAG-tagged PP5 with HSF1 was observed in both non-shocked and heat-shocked samples (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4), showing a direct interaction between exogenous PP5 and HSF1 complexes. These data provide evidence of a biochemical link between PP5 overexpression and changes in HSF1 activity and functional properties observed in PP5 expressing oocytes (see Figs. 1 and 4, 5, 6).Fig. 5Effect of PP5 on HSF1 deactivation during recovery. A, the decay of HSF1 binding activity was compared between uninjected controls (Control) and plasmid-microinjected oocytes expressing PP5. Oocytes were either not heat shocked (N) or heat shocked at 33 °C for 1 h (H) prior to recovery (times indicated) at 18 °C and analyzed by EMSA with HSE. B, EMSA of oocytes microinjected with 7.5 milliunits of PP1 or PP2A and subjected to heat shock and recovery as above. C, EMSA of oocytes microinjected with anti-PP5 Ab or anti-YY1 Ab, then subjected to heat shock and recovery (left panel, lanes 1–15), and Western blot of co-immunoprecipitation with HSF1 Ab (right panel).

N, no heat shock. Following heat shock, oocytes were further incubated for 12 h at 18 °C for expression, then subjected to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays. Treated samples (left panel, third and fourth lanes; right panels, third and fourth lanes) were manipulated as follows: A, co-microinjection of pCMV-PP5 for overexpression of PP5.

We have previously observed supershifts of HSF1-HSE complexes with anti-Hsp90, p23, and FKBP52 Abs (20Bharadwaj S. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8033-8041Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), results consistent with findings of pull-down experiments of others using HeLa cell extracts (21Guo Y. Guettouche T. Fenna M.

Distinct supershifted complexes with clearly reduced mobility were observed with Abs against PP5, HSF1, Hsp90, p23, Hip, and FKBP52 (Fig. 3C). This suggests that PP5 is a component of active trimeric HSF1 complexes along with Hsp90, p23, FKBP52, and Hip. HSF1-HSE complexes were not affected by Hop Abs (lanes 13 and 14), or control Abs against YY1 transcription factor or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (lanes 17–20). PP1 and PP2A Abs were also tested in these assays to test for possible interactions with the HSF1 heterocomplex, however, no supershift was observed (lanes 21–26). Effect of PP5 Phosphatase Activity on the DNA Binding Activity of HSF1—Co-IP and mobility supershift experiments (Fig. 3) establish PP5 as a component of the HSF1-Hsp90 heterocomplex, and we observed significantly reduced activation of HSF1 DNA binding after expression of exogenous PP5 (Fig. 1). The next series of experiments were aimed at determining whether the inhibitory effect on HSF1 was because of the specific PP5 phosphatase activity. Oocytes did not survive treatments with arachidonic acid, a well established activator of PP5 (36Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.

https://openalex.org/W2002257128,"We report here the structure of the putative chromo domain from MOF, a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases that acetylates histone H4 at Lys-16 and is part of the dosage compensation complex in Drosophila. We found that the structure of this domain is a β-barrel that is distinct from the α + β fold of the canonical chromo domain. Despite the differences, there are similarities that support an evolutionary relationship between the two domains, and we propose the name “chromo barrel.” The chromo barrel domains may be divided into two groups, MSL3-like and MOF-like, on the basis of whether a group of conserved aromatic residues is present or not. The structure suggests that, although the MOF-like domains may have a role in RNA binding, the MSL3-like domains could instead bind methylated residues. The MOF chromo barrel shares a common fold with other chromatin-associated modules, including the MBT-like repeat, Tudor, and PWWP domains. This structural similarity suggests a probable evolutionary pathway from these other modules to the canonical chromo domains (or vice versa) with the chromo barrel domain representing an intermediate structure.

Later, it was recognized that the HP1 family of proteins also contain a second highly related chromo shadow domain (2Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C.

The chromo shadow domain shares a common fold with the chromo domain, and it too has been found to be a protein interaction module (for a review, see Ref. 13Li Y. Kirschmann D.A. Wallrath L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16462-16469Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it binds peptides by sandwiching them between two β-strands, a feature it shares with the chromo domain, but it does so in a completely different way. When the chromo domains bind methylated peptides, they become sandwiched between two extended strands in the monomer (14Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T.

The chromo shadow domain, on the other hand, sandwiches the peptide between extended strands from the C-terminal tail of the two different subunits in the dimer (16Thiru A. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R.

Tufteland K.R. Aasland R. Becker P.B. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).The structure of the chromo domain-methylated histone H3 complex showed that three aromatic residues are essential for recognition of either mono-, di-, or trimethylamino groups, and these residues are conserved in most chromo domains, implying that they too may be involved in methylated peptide binding (14Nielsen P.R.

Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). By contrast, other chromo domains do not contain these conserved aromatic residues, and they are likely to have a different function (14Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 15Jacobs S.A. Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For example, the Drosophila Mi-2 chromo domain has been shown to bind DNA (18Bouazoune K. Mitterweger A. Langst G. Imhof A. Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Brehm A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2430-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, structure-guided sequence analysis indicates that a significant fraction of proteins, which are widely believed to contain chromo domains because they contain a short “chromo box” sequence motif (2Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), does not conform to this canonical fold (19Nielsen P.R. Callaghan J. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 148-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 20Martin I. Baker B.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 1240-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Examples of such proteins include members of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex: MSL3 and MOF. These proteins contain a putative chromo domain to the N terminus of the catalytic domain, which has been shown to be involved in interactions with RNA (21Akhtar A. Zink D. Becker P.B. Nature. 2000; 407: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).The dosage compensation mechanism in Drosophila is different from that in mammals. Genes in both female X chromosomes are actively expressed, but the single male X chromosome is transcribed at a 2-fold higher level to give an equal level of transcription in both sexes. This results from the differential expression of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex (see Scheme 1), which is known to include the MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MLE, and MOF proteins, as well as two nontranslated RNAs, roX1 and roX2 (22Akhtar A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MOF is a histone acetyltransferase that acetylates histone H4 at Lys-16, and this modification is specific for the dosage compensation mechanism (23Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Mol.

Zink D. Becker P.B. Nature. 2000; 407: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here we present the solution structure of the putative chromo domain from MOF, show that this new type of domain (chromo barrel) does not by itself bind RNA, and explore its structural and functional relationships with other proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of the MOF Chromo Barrel Domain—The DNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 367-454 of Drosophila MOF was inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen). The vector was transformed into the expression strain Escherichia coli TUNER (DE3) pLacI (Novagen) and the protein purified using standard methods (see supplemental information).NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculations—All NMR experiments were recorded at 25 °C on Bruker DRX 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance H/C/N z-gradient probes.

Further details are provided in the supplemental information.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDefinition of the Structured Domain—The fragment of MOF used in the structural studies (Fig. 1a) was chosen based on an alignment of canonical chromo domain amino acid sequences together with a sequence alignment and structure prediction of the new family of chromo barrel domains. The chromo barrel domain contains the conserved chromo box motif (Fig. 1b), but in addition, it is possible to recognize a pattern of aliphatic residues that define a strand equivalent to β1 in the chromo domain. N- and C-terminal to this, there are other clusters of aliphatic residues that we thought might also be part of the structure. This sequence, residues 367-440, was then extended at the C terminus until it included a good number of closely spaced charged residues (which were unlikely to be structured), resulting in a final construct composed of MOF residues 367-454.FIGURE 1a, construct of the MOF chromo barrel domain (CBD) used in this work.

The red shading indicates the aromatic pocket residues that bind the dimethylamino group in the HP1 chromo domain-histone H3 peptide complex, and cyan shading indicates the equivalent positions in the MOF and MSL3 families. (The position of a fourth aromatic residue, conserved in the MSL3 chromo barrels and the Pc chromo domains, is shaded in a lighter shade of cyan.) The purple shading indicates residues in the MOF chromo barrels that are structurally equivalent to H3-K9 in the HP1 chromo domain-histone H3 complex, whereas green shading indicates residues that might form a potential conserved turn in the MOF and MSL3 families. The black line shows the chromo box sequence motif originally used in sequence data base searches to identify chromo domains based on primary structure. In both a and b, the mutations in the chromo barrel domain that affect the interaction of MOF with RNA (21Akhtar A. Zink D. Becker P.B. Nature. 2000; 407: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) are shown by arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This construct was used to produce protein for NMR experiments. The domain was found to be monomeric by analytical ultracentrifugation (data not shown). Due to its high level of stability, it was possible to obtain a large number of structural restraints, and the resulting ensemble of structures has a high degree of precision (TABLE ONE). Fig. 2a shows an overlay of the 30 lowest energy structures aligned over the secondary structural elements; the root mean square deviation over the backbone atoms of the well defined part of the construct (residues 373-443) was 0.7 Å. The backbone dynamics of the structure was investigated by measuring the 15N T1 and T2 relaxation rates and the 1HN-15N heteronuclear NOE. These experiments defined the structured region as residues 374-437, with residues N-terminal to 370 and C-terminal to 441 being highly unstructured (data not shown). A model free analysis of the T1 and T2 relaxation rates suggested that the domain had an overall tumbling time of 7.2 ns, and the S2 values also suggested that the well defined region comprised residues 374-438 (S2 > 0.8 for data recorded on a 600-MHz spectrometer). However, a careful analysis of the NOE data showed that unambiguous NOEs that connected residues 439-443 to the core of the structure could be observed. It could be concluded, therefore, that these residues were probably only in this conformation transiently. Likewise, at the N terminus, there were NOEs connecting residues 370, 371, and 373 to the core of the structure, and these residues also probably only interacted transiently. In conclusion, the structured domain comprised residues 370-443, but the N and C termini only interacted transiently with the core of the protein.TABLE ONEExperimental restraints and structural statistics The loop between strands β3 and β4 is less well ordered than the rest of the structure. The cross peaks corresponding to residues 403 and 410 in the IH-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum are broadened indicative of slow time scale motions, and although the loop appears well defined in the ensemble, the Ramachandran plot reveals that several of the residues are constrained to unfavorable conformations, probably due to averaging of measured NMR parameters. It is however, likely that this loop is not completely flexible, because the values of the cross-correlated cross-relaxation rates (see “Materials and Methods”) are not averaged, as is the case for residues in the N- or C-terminal regions.Number of experimental restraintsUnambiguous distance restraints from NOEs Three-dimensional 13C-NOESY2684 Four-dimensional 15N, 13C-NOESY745 H-bonds9Ambiguous distance restraints from NOEs Three-dimensional 13C-NOESY2423 Four-dimensional 15N, 13C-NOESY442Dihedral restraints ϕ angles48 ψ angles51 χ1 angles36Coordinate precision〈SA〉a〈SA〉 represents the average r.m.s.d.

It consists of five β-strands (β1, residues 383-386; β2, residues 392-401; β3, residues 411-416; β4, residues 425-428; and β5, residues 432-433) organized into two sheets of three strands with one strand, β2, spanning the two sides of the domain. Strands β5, β1, and β2 form one side of the barrel and strands β2, β3, and β4, the other. A bulge in strand β2 (residues 398-399) helps provide the required geometry (Figs. 1b and 2). The β-barrel comprises amino acids 383-433, and the alignment clearly shows that the β-strands are conserved among the chromo barrel domains (Fig. 1b). However, as discussed above, the NOE data suggest that residues 370-443 are structured. The residues N-terminal to the β-barrel form a turn-like structure, with Ile-373 involved in forming a hydrophobic lid capping the β-barrel (Fig. 2c). This turn only forms transiently in the MOF domain, but analysis of the sequence alignment of the chromo barrel domains shows that a pair of large hydrophobic residues and one with a small side chain are conserved in the N terminus (see residues in green in Fig. 1b). This hydrophobic pair is typically separated by only two other residues, compared with the six in MOF, predicting a more stable hairpin turn in the chromo barrel domains from other proteins (e.g. MSL3). The residues C-terminal to strand β5 form one turn of the helix in the MOF domain but are not conserved in the chromo barrel family.Comparison of the Chromo and Chromo Barrel Domains—It is clear that the fold of the MOF chromo barrel domain is different from that of the chromo domain. The C-terminal helix of the chromo domain is absent in the chromo barrel, whereas two of the five β-strands are not present in the chromo domain (see Figs. 1b and 3). The residues conserved between the two types of domains, the originally defined chromo box motif, correspond to the β-hairpin formed by strands β2 and β3 in the chromo domain and strands β3 and β4 in the chromo barrel. The structural relationship between the chromo and chromo barrel domains is supported by a further feature: Arg-401 in β2 and Trp-426 in β4 stack against each other on the surface contributing to domain stability. These residues are conserved in a number of chromo and chromo barrel domains, supporting an evolutionary relationship between the two domains. For example, in the HP1, Drosophila Pc, and mouse M33 4S. M. Southall, P. R. Nielsen, D. Nietlispach, N. V. Murzina, and E. D. Laue, unpublished results. chromo domains, the structures reveal exactly the same interaction. The tryptophan is conserved in most of the domains, but the arginine is often absent (Fig. 1b). In most cases where this arginine is absent, the amino acid corresponding to Ser-400 is a large hydrophobic residue, and this may instead pack against the Trp. It is also possible that interactions with the conserved Tyr/Phe at position 412 compensate for the loss of the Arg to Trp stacking.FIGURE 3Comparison of the structures of the MOF chromo barrel and the HP1 chromo domain-histone H3 peptide complex. a, superposition (using residues in the β-strands) of the MOF chromo barrel and the HP1 chromo domain (residues 17-75)-histone H3 peptide (residues 4-11) complex. b, close up view of the methyl lysine binding site in a (where the structures are now superimposed using residues in the aromatic site) showing the three residues that form the aromatic pocket.

N, N terminus; C, C terminus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The three histidine residues in the domain are all involved in stabilizing the structure. The chemical shifts of the Nϵ2 proton in the imidazole side chains show that, at pH 5, His-393 and -430 are still partly deprotonated. The chemical shift changes of 1HN-15N pairs in heteronuclear single quantum correction spectra recorded at pH values of 5, 6, 7, and 8 also allowed an estimation of the pKa values of the histidines: His-393, pKa ∼ 6; His-430, pKa ∼ 6.5; and His-415, pKa ∼ 7.5. His-415 and Asp-424 form a salt bridge that fixes the ends of the loop between β3 and β4. This salt bridge is likely to be conserved among most of the chromo barrel and some of the chromo domains (Fig. 1b).Strikingly, however, when the chromo barrel domain is compared with that of the HP1 chromo domain in complex with the Lys-9-methylated N-terminal tail of histone H3 (H3-K9), there is a much higher degree of structural identity. In the MOF chromo barrel domain, the strand corresponding to the histone peptide in the chromo domain complex is provided by the N terminus of the protein, similar to the situation with the archaeal proteins Sac7d/Sso7 (29Gao Y.G.

This interaction prevents “chromo domain-like” peptide interactions. When the structures are aligned over the five β-strands, the root mean square deviation over the backbone atoms is only 1.3 Å. In effect, therefore, the chromo barrel structure is an “auto-inhibited” chromo domain, where methylated peptide binding is prevented by interactions of the protein with its own N-terminal tail.FIGURE 4The family of structures related to the chromo domain. The five strands in the MOF chromo barrel are color coded as in Fig. 2 with the remainder of the backbone in gray, apart from the loop connecting strands β2 and β3, which is yellow. In the HP1 chromo domain-histone H3 complex, the H3 peptide is black, and the methyl-K9 is purple. In the HP1β chromo shadow domain-CAF-1 p150 complex, one of the monomers is shaded in softer tones, and the CAF-1 peptide is pink. Sso7 is also shown in its complex with DNA. Strands that are equivalent to those in the MOF chromo barrel are shown using the same color scheme, and the positions of the conserved aromatic residues are indicated by spheres.

Khorasanizadeh S. Science. 2002; 295: 2080-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) shows that binding of the dimethylamino group of the lysine requires a cluster of aromatic residues on the surface of the protein. However, these three critical aromatic residues in the chromo domain are not conserved in the MOF chromo barrel domain; MOF has His-393, Tyr-416, and Leu-419, whereas HP1 has Tyr-21, Trp-42, and Phe-45 (see Figs. 1b and 3b). In addition, superposition of the two structures shows that the MOF residue Arg-387 would clash with the methylated Lys-9 side chain in the chromo domain-histone H3 complex (Fig. 3b). Consequently, binding of methylated residues is prevented in the MOF chromo barrel domain.The residues corresponding to the methyllysine binding aromatic box are, however, present in a subset of the chromo barrel domains (Fig. 1b). On this basis, the chromo barrel domains can be classified into MOF and MSL3 subfamilies. The MSL3 proteins have Tyr, Phe/Tyr, and Trp conserved in the positions corresponding to 21, 42, and 45 in the HP1 chromo domain. Moreover, in the MSL3 subfamily domains, Arg-387 in the MOF domain is replaced by a conserved histidine (Fig. 1b), and the conserved residues of the well defined loop between strands β1 and β2 suggest a different structure in this region. It is therefore possible that the exposed aromatic box provides a binding site for a methylated residue in the MSL3 (but not the MOF) group of chromo barrel domains.Previous studies of MOF have shown that the interaction of MOF and MSL3 is sensitive to RNase treatment. Furthermore, it has been shown that point mutations in the conserved Tyr-416/Trp-426 abolish RNA binding (21Akhtar A. Zink D. Becker P.B. Nature. 2000; 407: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Using RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays we found, however, that the MOF chromo barrel domain is not sufficient for binding either a randomly chosen fragment of roX1 RNA or other nonspecific RNA sequences (data not shown). Moreover, even very weak nonspecific binding could not be detected at much higher concentrations by NMR (data not shown). These results suggest, therefore, that the MOF chromo barrel domain is necessary (but not sufficient) for the interaction of MOF with RNA.The structure suggests that mutation of Tyr-416/Trp-426 is likely to affect the folding of the domain. Interestingly, these residues are adjacent to a conserved positively charged patch, the NRRL sequence in the loop connecting strands β3 to β4, which may be involved in the interaction with RNA. However, other MOF sequences are clearly also required. The involvement of residues outside the chromo barrel domain in RNA binding is also supported by the fact that acetylation of Lys-116"

Phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDK) inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity. There are four PDK isoforms, and expression of PDK4 and PDK2 genes is elevated in starvation and diabetes, allowing glucose to be conserved while fatty acid oxidation is increased. In these studies we have investigated the transcriptional mechanisms by which the expression of the PDK4 gene is increased. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator (PGC-1α) stimulates the expression of genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. We have found that PGC-1α will induce the expression of both the PDK2 and PDK4 genes in primary rat hepatocytes and ventricular myocytes. We cloned the promoter for the rat PDK4 gene. Hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), which activates many genes in the liver, will induce PDK4 expression. Although HNF4 and PGC-1α interact to stimulate several genes encoding gluconeogenic enzymes, the induction of PDK4 does not involve interactions of PGC-1α with HNF4. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we have demonstrated that HNF4 and PGC-1α are associated with the PDK4 gene in vivo. Our data suggest that by inducing PDK genes PGC-1α will direct pyruvate away from metabolism into acetyl-CoA and toward the formation of oxaloacetate and into the gluconeogenic pathway.

PDC is an important regulatory enzyme in the metabolism of glucose to acetyl-CoA (1Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The activity of PDC is controlled in part through its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatases, respectively (2Sugden M.C. Holness M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 3Huang B. Wu P. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). There are three serine phosphorylation sites on the α subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) that are targeted by PDKs. Phosphorylation will completely inhibit PDC activity (1Harris R.A. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Huang B. Wu P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2002; 42: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Sugden M.C. Holness M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The PDKs are subject to short term regulation including inhibition by the PDC substrates pyruvate and NAD+ as well as stimulation by the PDC products NADH and acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA, which stimulates PDK4 activity, may be derived from fatty acid or glucose oxidation (2Sugden M.C. Holness M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the liver PDC activity is high after a high carbohydrate diet, and the acetyl-CoA generated from PDC is utilized for the synthesis of long chain fatty acids (4Harris R.A. Huang B. Wu P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2001; 41: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).There are four PDK isoforms, and two of these, PDK2 and PDK4, are highly expressed in the liver, heart, and kidney (4Harris R.A.

Expression of both PDK2 and PDK4 genes are induced in starvation and by streptozotocin-induced diabetes (2Sugden M.C. Holness M.J. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Several factors including long chain fatty acids, glucocorticoids, and peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists will increase transcription of the PDK4 gene (5Holness M.J. Bulmer K.

The expression of both PDK2 and PDK4 is inhibited by insulin, although the PDK2 gene is more sensitive than the PDK4 gene to insulin inhibition in Morris hepatoma 7800 C1 cells (7Huang B. Wu P.

The heart genes encoding the fatty acid oxidation enzymes, such as medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the “muscle” isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-Iβ), are stimulated by PGC-1α (12Vega R.B.

The interactions with HNF4 and the glucocorticoid receptor are mediated in part through the AF2 domain in the nuclear receptor and the Leu-X-X-Leu-Leu (LXXLL) motif in PGC-1α.We hypothesized that PGC-1α might further regulate pyruvate metabolism by inducing the PDK genes. Here, we show that PGC-1α can induce PDK2 and PDK4 gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes and myocytes. We cloned the rat PDK4 promoter and examined the regulation of the PDK4 gene by PGC-1α.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of the Rat PDK4 Promoter—Genomic DNA was prepared from rat tails using a Qiagen genomic DNA isolation kit (QIAamp DNA kit 51304). A forward primer containing the sequence 5′-atggattaccacttcccagcactg (–2989/–2965) and a reverse primer, 5′-cgggagcgcggtcgagcgagagcaag (+87/+62), were used in polymerase chain reactions to amplify 2989 nucleotides of the promoter and 87 nucleotides of the first exon from the rat PDK4 gene.Identification of the Transcriptional Start Site by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—Transcription start site determinations were performed on DNase I-treated total RNA isolated from rat hepatocytes (19Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated with RNA-Stat 60 reagent (Tel-Test) as we have described previously (19Park E.A. Steffen M.L. Song S. Park V.M. Cook G.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cDNA was prepared using the 5′ RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen #18374-058). The following rat PDK4 gene-specific primers were designed with Primer3_www.cgiv 0.2 software. The gene-specific primer 1 (GSP1) (5′-cagggaggatgtcaat-3′) was used for reverse transcription to create a first strand PDK4 cDNA. The GSP2, 5′-atgttggcaagtctgacgggca-3′, and GSP3, 5′-gtctgacgggcaattcttg-3′, were used in the nested PCR reactions to identify the 5′ end of the mRNA. The PCR products were cloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector from the TOPO TA cloning vector system (Invitrogen K4575). The PCR products were sequenced at the University of Tennessee Molecular Resource Center.Transient Transfection of Luciferase Vectors—PDK4-luciferase (PDK4-luc) constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells by the calcium phosphate method (20Steffen M.L. Harrison W.R. Elder F.F. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transfections included 2 μg of PDK4-luciferase along with TK-Renilla and mammalian expression vectors for either HNF4 or PGC-1α. Cells were transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no serum. After 24 h, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega). Both luciferase and Renilla activity were measured. Protein content in each lysate was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Luciferase activity was corrected for both protein content and Renilla activity to account for cell density and transfection efficiency, respectively.The serial deletions of the rat PDK4 promoter were created by PCR amplification (20Steffen M.L. Harrison W.R. Elder F.F. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The forward primer contained a SacI site, and the reverse primer contained a Hind III site. These restriction sites were used for cloning of the rPDK4 promoter fragments into the luciferase reporter pGL3-basic (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis of the HNF4 binding sites was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (20Steffen M.L. Harrison W.R. Elder F.F. Cook G.A. Park E.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The sequences of the top primers were –1126/–1090, catcctccttacatgcgacagctactagcaccttggg, –218/–183, gcctccctctcactagttgctacttacaggccgtgg, and –140/–106, cggccaaagggaggctcctaacattcttgctctg. The altered nucleotides are underlined. All deletions and site-directed mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the University of Tennessee Molecular Resource Center.Adenoviral Infection of Primary Rat Hepatocytes and Neonatal Cardiac Ventricular Myocytes—Hepatocytes were obtained from livers of male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) as we have reported previously (21Deng X.

Rat primary hepatocytes were plated in RPMI 1640 media containing 20 mm glucose in the absence of serum before infection. Ventricular myocytes were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm glucose. The hepatocytes and myocytes were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 (23Song S. Zhang Y.

Sixteen hours after the infection the cells were changed to fresh medium. After infection for 48 h, RNA was isolated from the hepatocytes and myocytes.Western Analysis—Rats were made diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at 150 mg/kg of body weight (24Park E.A. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Kashfi K. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After 48 h it was confirmed that diabetes was induced by testing the urine for glucose and ketones using the Ames Multistix (Miles Inc.). Livers from control and diabetic rats as well as infected primary hepatocytes were harvested in PD buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 6 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and diluted protease inhibitor mixture Sigma P8340). The liver samples were sonicated 5 times at a setting of 5 in a 100-watt Microson sonicator (Misonix XL2000). Cell membranes were removed by centrifugation for 25 min at 4 °C. An equal amount of protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a 0.45-μm pure nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Blots were immunoblotted with primary antibodies (anti-PGC-1α, Santa Cruz sc-13067) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, 170-6515). Immunoreactive proteins were identified using Super Signal West Femto Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce).Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted from primary rat hepatocytes or cardiac myocytes using RNA-Stat-60 (Tel-Test) as described previously (14Zhang Y.

The RNA was initially treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37 °C for 1 h. The DNase I was stopped by the addition of DNase inactivation reagent to the sample. Equal amounts of DNA-free RNA were used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis. Up to 1 μg of RNA was mixed with 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix and 1 μl of random hexamers (50 ng/μl). Each sample was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and then placed on ice for at least 1 min. Next, 2 μl of 10× reverse transcription buffer, 4.5 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 1 μl of RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor was added to each tube. After incubation at 25 °C for 2 min, each tube was loaded with 1 μl of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. The tubes were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 1 h, and 70 °C for 15 min. RNase H was added to each to each tube and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The parameters for real time PCR were as follows: 95 °C for 11 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 1 min and, for the melt curve, 100 cycles of 10 s from 60 to 100 °C in 0.4 °C increments. The final concentration of primers in each well in the PCR plates was 0.1 μm. The oligonucleotide standards were diluted to 10–9, 10–8, 10–7, 10–6, and 10–5 μm and used as a template for the standard curve. The sequences of the PDK2 and PDK4 primers are provided in Table I. A 1:500 dilution of each cDNA as template was used to measure 18 S rRNA, and 1 μl of 1:10 or 1:20 dilution of each cDNA was used as a template to assess target genes.

Cells were scraped from the plate and collected by centrifuging for 5 min at 2000 rpm. The cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma #P8340). Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and vortexed once, and the pellet was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitor cocktails and incubated on ice for 15 min. The pellets were sonicated 9 times for 30 s at 1-min intervals (with a Branson Sonifer 250W, 2-mm micro tip setting = 7) followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant-containing DNA-protein complex was diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors. The samples were precleared by the addition of 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (50% slurry; Upstate, #16-157) for 30 min at 4 °C with rotation. The supernatant was incubated with 5–10 μg of anti-PGC-1α (Santa Cruz, sc-13067) or anti-HNF4 (Santa Cruz, sc-8987) at 4 °C overnight using rabbit IgG as the control. To collect the antibody-protein-DNA complex, 60 μl of protein A-agarose slurry was added for 2 h at 4 °C.The protein A-agarose was washed 1 time with 1 ml of each of the following buffers: low salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl); high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl); LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). This was followed by two 1-ml washes with 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, buffer. Precipitates were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). The DNA protein complexes were incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. The DNA was precipitated with the addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water, 4 μl of Tris, pH 6.8, 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K. After incubation at 45 °C for 1 h, genomic DNA fragments were purified using Qiaquick spin columns (Qiagen, #28104). A total of 2–5 μl of purified sample were used in 30–35 cycles of PCR.

Our first experiments were designed to determine whether PGC-1α could stimulate the expression of hepatic genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. We infected primary rat hepatocytes with adenoviruses expressing either GFP (Ad-GFP) or PGC-1α (Ad-PGC-1α). After 48 h, RNA was harvested, and the PDK2 and PDK4 mRNA abundance were measured by real-time PCR. As is shown in Fig. 1A, overexpression of PGC-1α increased the PDK4 mRNA abundance 6.2 ± 0.9-fold and the PDK2 mRNA abundance 9.0 ± 1.2-fold. PGC-1α stimulated the abundance of CPT-Iα mRNA 4-fold. Interestingly, the expression of mitochondrial hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, which is involved in ketogenesis, was not increased by PGC-1α overexpression (Fig. 1A). The expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturases 1 and 2 (SCD-1 and SCD-2) were not increased by PGC-1α. Long chain fatty acids will increase transcription of PDK4 (7Huang B. Wu P. Bowker-Kinley M.M.

https://openalex.org/W1972617381,"p21 is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that includes p21, p27, and p57. Recent studies have suggested that Cdk2 activity may promote p21 degradation through a pathway similar to that for p27, although the mechanism by which this occurs has not been clarified. In the current report, co-expression with cyclin E and Cdk2 stabilized p21 in a manner that required the CDK-binding site of p21 and a cyclin-binding site (cy1) located in the p21 N terminus. Strikingly, however, a kinase-dead Cdk2 mutant stabilized p21 to a greater extent than did wild-type Cdk2, consistent with the notion that Cdk2 activity can destabilize p21. The ability of wild-type Cdk2 to destabilize p21 required a potential Cdk2 phosphorylation site in p21 at serine 130 and an intact cyclin-binding motif (cy2) in the p21 C terminus. Finally, p21 was phosphorylated by Cdk2 at Ser-130 in vitro, and this ability of Cdk2 to phosphorylate p21 was dependent, in large part, on the presence of cy2. These results support a model in which active Cdk2 destabilizes p21 via the cy2 cyclin-binding motif and p21 phosphorylation. p21 is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors that includes p21, p27, and p57.

Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that p21 can bind directly with multiple cyclins and CDKs and can inhibit CDK activity in vitro and in vivo (2Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

This finding provided an attractive model for the p53-dependent G1 phase cell cycle arrest observed in response to DNA damage. According to this model, p53 activates p21 gene expression in response to DNA-damaging stress, and increased levels of p21 protein then bind and inhibit G1 phase cyclin-CDK complexes, resulting in a G1 arrest. Confirmation of this model came with the finding that p21-null cells have a deficient G1 arrest response following DNA damage (6Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T.

For example, p21 mRNA and protein levels increase in a p53-independent manner when muscle cells and keratinocytes are induced to differentiate (8Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T.

These results suggest that elevated p21 levels may trigger growth arrest and cell cycle exit during differentiation. p21 levels also increase in a p53-independent manner in response to various growth factors and ligands, including phorbol ester, tumor necrosis factor α, and epidermal growth factor (12Akashi M.

In these cases, the increase in p21 occurs primarily at the level of mRNA stability, and factors that can bind p21 mRNA and affect its stability have been identified (18Giles K.M. Daly J.M. Beveridge D.J. Thomson A.M. Voon D.C. Furneaux H.M. Jazayeri J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2937-2946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Increased p21 levels may contribute to the growth-inhibitory effect of these agents.Mechanisms that control p21 protein stability have not been fully clarified. Original studies suggested that p21 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This was based on the fact that p21-ubiquitin conjugates were detected in cells, and the p21 protein was stabilized by proteasome inhibition (19Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 20Blagosklonny M.V. Wu G.S. Omura S. el-Deiry W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Acta. 1999; 1451: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, later studies reported a p21 mutant lacking all lysines as potential ubiquitination sites could still be targeted for proteasomal degradation (22Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This suggested a proteasome-dependent, but ubiquitin-independent, mode of degradation. Support for this idea came from reports that the p21 C terminus can interact directly with the C8 proteasome subunit to mediate p21 degradation in vitro (23Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Still other studies found that lysine-deficient p21 could still be targeted for ubiquitin-mediated degradation through attachment of ubiquitin moieties to the extreme N terminus of p21. The effect of cyclins and CDKs on p21 stability has also not been clarified. p21 contains two cyclin-binding sites, designated cy1 and cy2, located in either the N or C terminus, and a single CDK-binding site located in the central region (24Adams P.D.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that mutant p21 lacking its CDK-binding site displayed increased stability compared with wild-type p21, suggesting that CDK-binding may promote p21 degradation (26Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recent studies have also suggested that CDK activity may promote p21 degradation. In particular, active Cdk2 could enhance the in vitro ubiquitination of p21 mediated by a Skp2-containing SCF (Skp, Cullin, and F-box protein) complex (27Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings, cyclin D1 was reported to stabilize p21, perhaps by binding the cy2 site in the p21 C terminus and blocking p21 interaction with the C8 proteasome subunit (28Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2036-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of cyclin E and Cdk2 on p21 protein stability.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid DNAs—DNA encoding Myc-tagged cyclin E was from Jim Roberts (University of Washington). DNAs encoding wild-type (WT) p21, Cdk2 WT, and Cdk2 NFG were from Phil Hinds (Boston University). Nontagged p21 mutants lacking cy1, cy2, or the CDK-binding region were generated by single- or two-step PCR using wild-type p21 as template and were cloned into the HindIII and XbaI sites of pCDNA-3.0. The 5′ forward primer used in cloning each of these p21 mutants was as follows: 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTTGG-3′. The 3′ reverse primer used in cloning these p21 mutants was 5′-CATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATAGGGCCCTCTAGATGC-3′.

FLAG-tagged forms of p21 were generated by PCR using the DNAs encoding nontagged forms of p21 described above as templates. For each of these FLAG-tagged p21s, the 5′ primer used in cloning was 5′-TCGGGATCCCGATCAGAACCGGCTGG-3′. The 3′ reverse primer was the same as described above. The resulting PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and cloned downstream of the FLAG epitope in pcDNA-3.0.Tissue Culture, Immunoblots, Immunoprecipitation—Saos-2 (p53-null) and HeLa cells were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Transfections were done using the calcium phosphate transfection method (as described previously (19Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)). For half-life experiments, cells were treated with cyclohexamide (CHX) at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. MG132 was used at 30 μm. Cells were scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin) and lysed on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing, followed by 15 min centrifugation. For co-immunoprecipitation studies from labeled cells, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine-containing medium (100 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Extracts were then immunoprecipitated with p21 polyclonal antibody 15431E (Pharmingen), resolved by SDS-PAGE and exposed to film. For co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged p21s with Cdk2 NFG, transfected cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 polyclonal antibody (F7425; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the immunoprecipitates were examined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M5; Sigma). For other immunoblotting, cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Poly-Screen polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies used for detection were as follows: p21 (15091A; Pharmingen), Cdk2 (F7425; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Myc (Ab-1; Oncogene Science), and HA (HA.11 monoclonal; Babco).In Vitro Kinase Assays—HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were transfected with 1.6 μg of Cdk2 WT or Cdk2 NFG DNA, 1.6 μg of Myc-cyclin E, and 1 μg of FLAG-tagged p21. Cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in modified lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin). Lysates were immunoprecipitated for 12 h with 2 mg of anti-c-Myc antibody (sc-40; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were immobilized on protein A-agarose beads, washed once with ice-cold modified lysis buffer and twice with kinase wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to film for autoradiography.RESULTSTo examine the effect of cyclin E and Cdk2 on p21 protein stability, we monitored p21 stability when expressed alone or when co-expressed with Myc-tagged cyclin E and Cdk2 (Fig. 1A). In some cases, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, previously shown to stabilize p21. p21 was unstable when expressed alone in Saos-2 cells ( t12∼30min). In contrast, p21 levels were increased, and the protein was stabilized in the presence of MG132 or when co-expressed with cyclin E and Cdk2 ( t12 in each case > 3 h). Binding between p21 and cyclin E and Cdk2 was verified in these experiments by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B).We next asked whether cyclin E or Cdk2 alone could stabilize p21, and which p21 regions were necessary. p21 contains two cyclin-binding sites (cy1 and cy2) in the N and C terminus and a central CDK-binding site (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2C, Cdk2 caused pronounced stabilization of WT p21, but did not stabilize p21 that lacked the CDK-binding site. This indicates that Cdk2 stabilizes p21 through the CDK-binding site. In contrast, Myc-cyclin E caused only slight stabilization of WT p21 and less stabilization of p21 that lacked cy1 (Δcy1; Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, however, cyclin E caused pronounced stabilization of p21 that lacked cy2 (Δcy2), suggesting that cy2 may inhibit p21 stabilization by cyclin E. Stabilization of p21 Δcy2 by cyclin E was diminished when the CDK-binding site was simultaneously deleted (p21 ΔCDK, Δcy2) and was completely abolished when both cyclin-binding sites and the CDK-binding site were deleted (p21 Δcy1 + 2, ΔCDK). In total, these data indicate that cyclin E can stabilize p21 but that this stabilization is inhibited by the presence of cy2. The ability of cyclin E to fully stabilize p21 appears to require both cy1 and the CDK-binding site.Fig. 2p21 domains required for stabilization by cyclin E and Cdk2. A, schematic of the p21 protein with the CDK-binding site, cy1 and cy2 cyclin-binding sites, and potential CDK phosphorylation sites (Thr-57, Ser-98, and Ser-130) indicated. B and C, cells were transfected with 150 ng of the indicated p21 DNAs and 5 μg of Myc-cyclin E and Cdk2 DNA, as indicated. Transfected cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection and immunoblotted (IB) for p21, cyclin E, and Cdk2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fact that cyclin E and Cdk2 can stabilize p21 was surprising given earlier suggestions that CDK activity may promote p21 degradation (26Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, p21 levels were monitored when expressed with WT Cdk2 or a kinase-dead Cdk2 (referred to as Cdk2 NFG) that is mutated in its ATP-binding site (29van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, WT Cdk2 stabilized p21 when both proteins were co-expressed. Strikingly, however, p21 was stabilized to a greater extent when co-expressed with Cdk2 NFG, despite WT Cdk2 and Cdk2 NFG being equally expressed. Similarly, p21 was stabilized to a relatively low extent when expressed with cyclin E and WT Cdk2 but stabilized to a greater extent when expressed with cyclin E and Cdk2 NFG (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Cdk2 kinase activity can negatively affect p21 stability. To explain these results, we hypothesized that inactive Cdk2 may stabilize p21, whereas active Cdk2 may promote p21 degradation. The majority of WT Cdk2 may be inactivated when expressed with p21 and may stabilize the p21 protein. However, a fraction of WT Cdk2 may remain active when expressed with p21 and able to promote p21 phosphorylation and degradation. The net effect in this situation is p21 stabilization. In contrast, Cdk2 NFG is constitutively inactive and can stabilize p21 but is completely deficient in promoting p21 degradation. Thus, a greater stabilization of p21 is observed.Fig. 3Inactive Cdk2 stabilizes p21 to a greater extent than wild-type Cdk2. A, HeLa cells (left) and Saos-2 cells (right) were transfected with 100 ng of p21 DNA and 7.5 μg of DNA encoding wild-type Cdk2 or the catalytically inactive Cdk2 mutant (Cdk2 NFG). p21 and Cdk2 protein levels were monitored by immunoblotting 20 h later. Higher levels of p21 were consistently observed when p21 was expressed with Cdk2 NFG than when expressed with WT Cdk2. B, p21 levels were monitored in Saos-2 cells transfected with 150 ng of p21 DNA and 5 μg each of cyclin E and either WT Cdk2 or Cdk2 NFG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If this model is correct, then p21 mutant proteins lacking the necessary Cdk2 phosphorylation sites should be highly stabilized by WT Cdk2 and not further stabilized by Cdk2 NFG. To test this, each potential Cdk2 phosphorylation site within p21 (threonine 57, serine 98, and serine 130) was converted to alanine. These p21 mutants (or WT p21) were expressed with either WT Cdk2 or Cdk2 NFG, and p21 levels were assessed (Fig. 4A). Wild-type p21, p21 T57A, and p21 S98A behaved similarly in these experiments, being stabilized to a relatively low extent when expressed with WT Cdk2, but markedly further stabilized when expressed with Cdk2 NFG. In contrast, p21 S130A was highly stabilized by WT Cdk2, with no further stabilization by Cdk2 NFG. These results support a role for Ser-130 in the Cdk2-dependent destabilization of p21. Phosphorylation at Ser-130 has been suggested to either stabilize p21 (30Kim G.Y. Mercer S.E. Ewton D.Z. Yan Z. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29792-29802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or promote p21 degradation (27Bornstein G. Bloom J. Sitry-Shevah D. Nakayama K. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25752-25757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). It was therefore unclear what effect mutation of Ser-130 would have on transfected p21 protein stability. To examine this, we monitored the half-life of WT p21 and each of the p21 phosphor site mutants (Fig. 4, B and C). p21 S130A displayed a modest increase in stability compared with wild-type p21 in some experiments (not shown). However, in most experiments, wild-type p21 and each of the p21 phosphor site mutants displayed a similar short half-life of 20 min or less (Fig. 4, B and C).Fig. 4Effect of Cdk2 on the stability of p21 phosphorylation site mutants. A, Saos-2 cells were transfected with 150 ng of WT p21 or the indicated p21 phosphorylation site mutants either alone or with cotransfection of DNA encoding WT Cdk2 or Cdk2 NFG (5 μg each). p21 and Cdk2 protein levels were monitored 20 h later. B, cells were transfected with 600 ng of DNA encoding WT p21 or the indicated p21 phosphorylation site mutants. Transfected cells were treated with CHX (25 μg/ml) 16 h after transfection, and p21 protein levels were monitored at the indicated times after CHX addition. C, p21 levels from at least two separate half-life experiments similar to those in B were quantitated by densitometry and are plotted. IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural studies of p27 bound to a cyclin A-Cdk2 complex revealed that p27 inhibits this complex, at least in part, by inserting into the Cdk2 catalytic cleft (31Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Direct binding between Cdk2 and p21 is predicted to inhibit Cdk2 activity through a similar mechanism and thus prevent Cdk2 from promoting p21 degradation. In contrast, Cdk2 may remain active and able to destabilize p21 if bound indirectly through its association with one or more cyclins. We predicted, therefore, that the ability of WT Cdk2 to destabilize p21 would require the cy1 and/or cy2 cyclin-binding sites. To address this possibility, we first tested whether Cdk2 could bind p21 indirectly via the cy1 and/or cy2 cyclin-binding motifs. Cdk2 NFG was transiently expressed with FLAG-tagged forms of p21 that lacked the Cdk-binding motif, cy1, or cy2 in different combinations. Transfected cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Cdk2 antibody, followed by immunoblotting for the FLAG epitope. We used Cdk2 NFG in these experiments to avoid any potential degradation of p21 that might be mediated by the WT Cdk2 protein. As shown in Fig. 5 (top), a large amount of WT p21 co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 NFG, indicating that a strong complex between these two proteins was formed. Importantly, p21 that lacked the CDK-binding site (ΔCDK) also formed a complex with Cdk2 NFG, although to a lesser extent than WT p21. This indicates that Cdk2 can bind p21 in an indirect manner that does not require the CDK-binding site. A double deletion mutant lacking the CDK-binding site and cy1 (p21 Δcy1, CDK) could also bind Cdk2 NFG, indicating that indirect binding of Cdk2 to p21 does not absolutely require cy1. It is important to note, however, that whereas comparable levels of p21 ΔCDK and p21 Δcy1, CDK were co-immunoprecipitated with Cdk2 NFG in these experiments, the p21 ΔCdk2 mutant was expressed at a lower level than p21 Δcy1, CDK (Fig. 5, bottom). Thus, deletion of cy1 diminished, but did not completely inhibit, the indirect binding of Cdk2 NFG to p21. Finally, a mutant lacking the CDK-binding site and both cyclin-binding sites (Δcy1 + 2, CDK) was tested for Cdk2 NFG binding. As shown in Fig. 5, this mutant was completely deficient in binding to Cdk2 NFG. Taken together, these results indicate that Cdk2 can bind p21 indirectly, and this binding occurs via the cy1 and cy2 cyclin-binding motifs.Fig. 5Cdk2 can bind p21 indirectly through the cyclin-binding sites. Top, HeLa cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of DNA encoding Cdk2 NFG and the indicated FLAG-tagged forms of p21. 30 h after transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Cdk2 polyclonal antibody and examined by immunoblotting (IB) for the FLAG epitope. Cdk2 NFG could bind p21 ΔCDK. However, deletion of cy1 diminished this binding, and further deletion of cy2 completely abolished this binding. Bottom, levels of Cdk2 and the FLAG-tagged p21 proteins were determined by immunoblotting without prior immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested whether cy1 and/or cy2 are required for Cdk2 to destabilize p21. To this end, WT p21 and p21 mutants lacking cy1 and/or cy2 were assessed for stabilization when expressed with either WT Cdk2 or Cdk2 NFG. As shown in Fig. 6A, WT p21 and p21 Δcy1 were stabilized to comparable extents when expressed with inactive Cdk2 NFG. However, p21 Δcy1 displayed much less stabilization than WT p21 when either protein was expressed with Cdk2 WT. This suggests that p21 Δcy1 is more susceptible than WT p21 to destabilization by WT Cdk2. In contrast, p21 mutants lacking cy2 (Δcy2 and Δcy1 + 2) were highly stabilized by WT Cdk2 with little to no further stabilization by Cdk2 NFG. These results indicate that cy2 is important for WT Cdk2 to destabilize p21. Finally, we monitored the half-life of wild-type p21 and mutants lacking cy1 and/or cy2 (Fig. 6, B and C). Wild-type p21 was again rapidly degraded, with a half-life of less than 20 min. Importantly, the half-life of p21 Δcy2 was extended to ∼20-40 min, consistent with other studies (23Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and supporting a role for cy2 in normal p21 degradation. The S130A mutation did not further stabilize the p21 Δcy2 mutant (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, deletion of cy1 caused a pronounced stabilization of p21 (Fig. 6C) despite the fact that cy1 plays no apparent role in Cdk2-dependent degradation ( t12 of p21 Δcy1 and p21 Δcy1 + 2 >80 min). This suggests that cy1 may play an important role in the degradation of p21 that is Cdk2-independent.Fig. 6Effect of Cdk2 on the stability of p21 mutants that lack intact cyclin-binding sites. A, Saos-2 cells were transfected with 150 ng of WT p21 or p21 deletion mutants lacking the cy1 or cy2 cyclin-binding sites either alone or with cotransfection of DNA encoding WT Cdk2 or Cdk2 NFG (5 μg each). p21 and Cdk2 protein levels were monitored 20 h later. B, cells were transfected with 600 ng of DNA encoding WT p21 or the indicated cy1 and cy2 deletion mutants. Transfected cells were treated with CHX (25 μg/ml) 20 h after transfection, and p21 protein levels were monitored at the indicated times after CHX addition. C, p21 levels from at least two separate half-life experiments similar to those in B were quantitated by densitometry and are plotted.

IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Results presented thus far suggest that active Cdk2 may bind p21 indirectly through the cy2 cyclin-binding site and subsequently destabilize p21 through phosphorylation at Ser-130. To examine this further, we tested whether Cdk2 can phosphorylate p21 at Ser-130 and whether this phosphorylation requires cy2. HeLa cells were transfected with DNAs encoding Cdk2, Myc-tagged cyclin E, and different FLAG-tagged p21 proteins. Transfected cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody to isolate cyclin E-Cdk2-p21 complexes. The immunoprecipitates were either incubated under in vitro kinase assay conditions to monitor p21 phosphorylation (Fig. 7A) or examined by immunoblotting to detect the level of co-immunoprecipitating FLAG-p21 protein (Fig. 7B, top). As expected, wild-type p21 was weakly phosphorylated by Cdk2 WT but was not phosphorylated by Cdk2 NFG (Fig. 7A). This low level of wild-type p21 phosphorylation is consistent with Cdk2 activity being mostly inhibited by the wild-type p21 protein. In contrast, p21 Δcy2 was either not phosphorylated or phosphorylated less well than wild-type p21, suggesting that cy2 is important for Cdk2-dependent p21 phosphorylation. p21 S130A was also phosphorylated less well than wild-type p21, ind"

Calmodulin, the major intracellular Ca2+ receptor, modulates both osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. The calmodulin antagonist, trifluoperazine, rescues bone loss in ovariectomized mice (Zhang, L., Feng, X., and McDonald, J. M. (2003) Endocrinology 144, 4536-4543). We show here that a 3-h treatment of mouse osteoclasts with either of the calmodulin antagonists, tamoxifen or trifluoperazine, induces osteoclast apoptosis dose-dependently. Tamoxifen, 10 μm, and trifluoperazine, 10 μm, induce 7.3 ± 1.8-fold and 5.3 ± 0.9-fold increases in osteoclast apoptosis, respectively. In Jurkat cells, calmodulin binds to Fas, the death receptor, and this binding is regulated during Fas-mediated apoptosis (Ahn, E. Y., Lim, S. T., Cook, W. J., and McDonald, J. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 5661-5666). In osteoclasts, calmodulin also binds Fas. When osteoclasts are treated with 10 μm trifluoperazine, the binding between Fas and calmodulin is dramatically decreased at 15 min and gradually recovers by 60 min. A point mutation of the Fas death domain in the Lpr-cg mouse renders Fas inactive. Using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, the human Fas cytoplasmic domain is shown to bind calmodulin, whereas a point mutation (V254N) comparable with the Lpr-cg mutation in mice has markedly reduced calmodulin binding. Osteoclasts derived from Lpr-cg mice have diminished calmodulin/Fas binding and are more sensitive to calmodulin antagonist-induced apoptosis than those from wild-type mice. Both tamoxifen- and trifluoperazine-induced apoptosis are increased 1.6 ± 0.2-fold in Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts compared with osteoclasts derived from wild-type mice. In summary, calmodulin antagonists induce apoptosis in osteoclasts by a mechanism involving interference with calmodulin binding to Fas. The effects of calmodulin/Fas binding on calmodulin antagonist-induced apoptosis may open a new avenue for therapy for osteoporosis.

Healthy adult bone requires a balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts.

The inability of Fas to induce apoptosis in osteoclasts, under osteolytic conditions, led us to search for a novel mechanism by which osteoclast apoptosis is mediated.

Calmodulin and Signal Transduction. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). CaM antagonists bind to CaM, blocking the binding of substrates and thus preventing activation of CaM (16Evans J.S. Levine B.A. Williams R.J.P. Wormald M.R. Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishers, New York1988: 57-82Google Scholar) and of its downstream signals, many of which are cell type-specific. In osteoclasts, the inhibition of CaM or its downstream pathways has impact on both differentiation and function. One of the main downstream target molecules for CaM is calcineurin. Inhibition of the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway blocks RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation (17Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M.

Zhang et al. (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) showed that the CaM antagonist, trifluoperazine (TFP), inhibits osteoclastogenesis when added on day 3 of a 6-day differentiation period and that it rescues ovariectomy-induced bone loss in mice (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Another CaM antagonist, tamoxifen (TMX), is also an estrogen antagonist (18Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S. Newcomb P.A. Jordan V.C. Carbone P.P. DeMets D.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, TMX has been reported to preserve bone mass, as does estrogen. TMX decreases osteoclastic bone resorption most likely via its CaM-antagonistic properties (19Williams J.P. Blair H.C. McKenna M.A. Jordan S.E. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12488-12495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of the diverse functions of CaM is mediating cell apoptosis. Whether CaM antagonists can induce osteoclast apoptosis in addition to their known inhibition of osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity is unknown. The importance of CaM in apoptosis has been suggested before (20Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In different cell lines, CaM exerts either an anti-apoptotic or a pro-apoptotic influence by regulating various downstream targets (21Franklin R.A. McCubrey J.A. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2000; 14: 2019-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For example, in HIV-infected T cells CaM binds to glycoprotein 160, the envelope protein of HIV, enhancing Fas-mediated apoptosis; thus CaM antagonists inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in these cells (22Micoli K.J. Pan G. Wu Y. Williams J.P. Cook W.J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1233-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the human cholangiocarcinoma cell line, SK-ChA-1, where the Fas protein is heterogeneously expressed at the cell surface (23Pan G. Vickers S.M. Pickens A. Phillips J.O. Ying W. Thompson J.A. Siegal G.P. McDonald J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), Pan et al. (23Pan G. Vickers S.M. Pickens A.

In this study, we focus on the interaction between Fas and CaM, the involvement of CaM in osteoclast apoptosis, and more importantly, how the interaction between CaM and Fas affects CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach to shorten osteoclast life span under osteolytic conditions in which the levels of Fas are likely to be decreased. Animals—Five 8-week-old, male, B6.mrl-tnfrsf6lpr/J, MRL.CBAJms-Tnfrsf6lpr-cg/J, and control mice for each strain were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All procedures involving animal use and care were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and conducted in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—Primary mouse osteoclast precursors were isolated from bone marrow and differentiated into mature osteoclasts in vitro in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, as described previously (7Wu X. McKenna M.A. Feng X. Nagy T.R. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5545-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts were also derived, as described previously, from RAW264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage line, purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) (7Wu X. McKenna M.A. Feng X. Nagy T.R. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5545-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). CaM-Sepharose 4B and GST antibody were from Amersham Biosciences, and Sepharose CL-4B was from Sigma. Fas (polyclonal, M-20) and caspase-3 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody to CaM was developed as described previously (24Sacks D.B. Porter S.E. Ladenson J.H. McDonald J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Generation of Fas Fragments by the Polymerase Chain Reaction—The cytoplasmic domain (191-335) of human Fas was generated by PCR with the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primers containing EcoRI (underlined) and XhoI (bold) sites: F1, 5′-ccactaataattcgtgaagagaaagg-3′; R1, 5′-catatactcagaatcgagttgttgttt-3′. The Fas point mutation, V254N, was generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers for the mutagenesis were purchased from Invitrogen. Wild-type or mutated Fas cytoplasmic regions were inserted into the pGEX5-1 vector using the EcoRI and XhoI sites. Expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Biosciences). Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining of condensed chromatin (25Kameda T. Ishikawa H. Tsutsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cells, differentiated on coverslips, were treated with various concentrations of TFP and TMX, as indicated, and stained with Hoechst 33258 fluorescent dye (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 2 min at room temperature. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy and calculated as apoptotic multinucleated cells/total number of multinucleated cells × 100%. Only cells containing more than three nuclei were included in the count. Fluorescent Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured using the ApoAlert caspase fluorescent assay kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, cells were lysed in 50 μl of buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged and supernatants collected. Reaction buffer/dithiothreitol mix (50 μl) and 5 μl of 1 mm caspase-3 substrate were added to each reaction and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.) was used to measure fluorescence (excitation at 400 nm and emission at 505 nm). CaM-Sepharose Pull-down Assay—Cell lysates were incubated with equal amounts of either control Sepharose CL-4B or CaM-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 1-3 h. After incubation, beads were washed six times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS to remove nonspecific binding and heated in SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. Co-immunoprecipitation—Anti-CaM monoclonal antibody and nonimmune mouse IgG1κ were coupled to AminoLink Plus coupling gel (Pierce), as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in M-PER reagent (Pierce) and cell debris removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Equal amounts of protein (100-200 μg) were incubated with anti-CaM antibody or mouse IgG1κ antibody (15 μg)-coupled gel in a Handee spin cup column (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. Samples were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (Pierce). Co-immunoprecipitated proteins bound to the antibody-coupled gel were eluted with 50 μl of ImmunoPure elution buffer (Pierce) at 12,000 × g for 1 min. 125I-CaM Preparation—IODO-BEADS (Pierce) were washed in 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, dried, and added to a solution containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 1 mCi of 125I, for 5 min at room temperature. The IODO-BEAD-containing solution was incubated with 100 μl of CaM, 1 mg/ml, for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by applying the solution to a Bio-Rad 10DG column (Bio-Rad), which had been pre-equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.5. Seven 1-ml fractions were collected. Total 125I cpm in 5 μl were counted in a γ-counter. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated 125I cpm were measured by adding 900 μl of 1% BSA/PBS and 100 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid to 5-μl aliquots, incubating on ice for 15 min, spinning at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and counting the pellets in the γ-counter. Total 125I and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated 125I versus fraction number was plotted. The percentage of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated 125I/total 125I was greater than 90%. 125I-CaM Overlay—125I-CaM overlay was performed as described (26Radding W. Williams J.P. McKenna M.A. Tummala R. Hunter E. Tytler E.M. McDonald J.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2000; 16: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, following 7.5% SDS-PAGE, protein bands were fixed in 40% ethanol and 7% acetic acid for 30 min, rinsed with water, renatured in 10% ethanol overnight with shaking, and then rinsed in water. After incubation with buffer A (100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) for 30 min, and then with buffer B (20 mm imidazole, 0.1% BSA, 0.2 m KCl, pH 7.0 plus 1 mm CaCl2 or 1 mm EGTA) for 10 min, the gels were incubated with buffer B containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml of 125I-CaM for 12-16 h at 4 °C. The nonspecifically bound 125I-CaM was removed by several washes with buffer B at 4 °C. The gels were rinsed with water five times for 5 min each, washed in 40% methanol, 7% acetic acid for 15 h to remove BSA, stained for 2 h in Commassie Brilliant Blue G-250, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (7Wu X. McKenna M.A. Feng X. Nagy T.R. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5545-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and subsequently electrotransfered to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the membrane was incubated with purified anti-Fas (4 μg/ml), followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilution). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. As an additional control to ensure equal protein loading of gels, after transfer, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, and examined for any abnormal protein band densities. CaM Antagonists Induce Osteoclast Apoptosis—The CaM antagonists, TFP and TMX, induce apoptosis in osteoclasts, concentration-dependently. TFP inhibits osteoclastogenesis when added on day 3 of a full 6-day differentiation period and does not induce apoptosis in osteoclast progenitors (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TMX, an anti-estrogen and also a potent CaM antagonist, inhibits bone resorption in avian osteoclasts (19Williams J.P. Blair H.C. McKenna M.A. Jordan S.E. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12488-12495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Whether CaM antagonists decrease osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by inducing apoptosis in osteoclasts, especially at the later stages of osteoclastogenesis, is unknown. Here, using Hoechst 33258 staining of fragmented nuclei, we showed that in vitro differentiated mouse osteoclasts undergo apoptosis after a 3-h treatment with the CaM antagonists, TFP and TMX, in concentration-dependent manners (Fig. 1). TFP, 10 μm, induces a 5.3 ± 0.9-fold increase in osteoclast apoptosis, and TMX induces a 7.3 ± 1.8-fold increase. Fig. 1C shows a typical apoptotic multinucleated osteoclast (left, double arrow) and a normal osteoclast (right, single arrow). Note the multiple brightly stained nuclear fragments in the apoptotic osteoclast. Caspase-3 Is Activated by CaM Antagonists in Osteoclasts—Caspase-3, the major executioner in the apoptosis pathway, is activated by CaM antagonists. Caspase-3 is produced as a catalytically inactive zymogen being activated by proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis (27Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that caspase-3 is involved in osteoclast apoptosis induced by CaM antagonists, we treated differentiated osteoclasts with various concentrations of TFP and TMX, demonstrating activation of caspase-3 by the disappearance of the noncleaved form, detected by Western blotting. Treatment with increasing concentrations of drug decreases the amount of procaspase-3 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). These results were confirmed by measuring caspase-3 activity, a surrogate marker for apoptosis, by a fluorescent caspase-3 activity assay (Fig. 2C). CaM Interacts with Fas in Osteoclasts—CaM interacts with Fas in osteoclasts, as detected by CaM-Sepharose 4B pull down, co-immuoprecipitation, and 125I-CaM overlay. CaM has recently been reported to bind to the death receptor, Fas, in Jurkat cells by Ahn et al. (2Ahn E.Y. Lim S.T. Cook W.J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5661-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the human cholangiocarcinoma cell line SK-ChA-1. 2Y. Chen, P. Pawar and J. M. McDonald, unpublished observations. In osteoclasts, CaM-Sepharose 4B was able to pull down Fas from lysates of differentiated mouse cells. Sepharose CL-4B was used as a negative control. Fas was detected only in the CaM-Sepharose-bound proteins (Fig. 3A). As many CaM-target protein interactions are Ca2+-dependent (28Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), we investigated the Ca2+ dependence of the CaM/Fas binding in osteoclasts by adding Ca2+ (1 mm) or EGTA (1 mm) to the binding buffer and showed a partial calcium dependence (Fig. 3A). To verify whether CaM and Fas interact in vivo we incubated CaM antibody, conjugated to AminoLink Plus gel, with lysates from differentiated osteoclasts. Mouse IgG1κ was used as a nonimmune control. As shown in Fig. 3B, Fas was co-immunoprecipitated with CaM, confirming the presence of the complex in cells. The binding of CaM to Fas was confirmed by 125I-labeled CaM overlay of renatured SDS-PAGE-separated cell lysates from differentiated osteoclasts. After washing to remove nonspecifically bound 125I-CaM, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at -70 °C. A band was detected at a molecular mass of 45-48 kDa, the size of Fas. Addition of EGTA during the incubation results in decreased intensity of this band (Fig. 3C). Treatment with CaM Antagonists Decreases the Binding between CaM and Fas—CaM/Fas binding is decreased by treatment with the CaM antagonist, TFP. The addition of a Fasneutralizing antibody cannot block CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis in SK-ChA-1 cells (2Ahn E.Y. Lim S.T. Cook W.J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5661-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis does not require a direct interaction between the CaM antagonist and the trimerized Fas antigen. To further explore the mechanisms by which CaM antagonists induce apoptosis in osteoclasts, we treated osteoclasts derived from RAW264.7 cells with 10 μm TFP for various times. By co-immunoprecipitating Fas with gel-conjugated CaM antibody, we detected a marked decrease in CaM/Fas binding at 15 min in osteoclast lysates (Fig. 4A), which recovered, in part, by 60 min (Fig. 4A). Treatment of RAW264.7-derived osteoclasts with various concentrations of TFP for 15 min resulted in decreased CaM/Fas binding at 5 and 10 μm but not at 2.5 μm (Fig. 4B). These observations are consistent with CaM antagonists inducing apoptosis in osteoclasts by inhibiting CaM/Fas binding. TFP, 10 μm, treatment for 15 min yields a 66.1 ± 9% inhibition of CaM binding to Fas, obtained by calculating the ratio of the band intensities in each experiment (n = 5). The Lpr-cg Mutation Abrogates the Binding between CaM and Fas—A point mutation (I225N) in the DD of Fas decreases binding to CaM in osteoclasts derived from Lpr-cg mice. This mutation blocks the Fas-FADD interaction causing a defect in Fas signaling that leads to a lymphoproliferation phenotype in Lpr-cg mice (5Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). Based on sequence alignment analysis of mouse and human Fas, isoleucine 225 of mouse Fas, which is mutated to asparagine in the Lpr-cg mouse (29Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is equivalent in position to valine 254 of human Fas. A GST fusion protein of the Fas intracellular domain, containing a similar point mutation in the DD of human Fas (V254N), was generated and had reduced binding to CaM in vitro compared with the nonmutated sequence (Fig. 5A). The potential significance of CaM binding to the DD of Fas is illustrated in vivo by comparing the CaM/Fas binding in osteoclasts derived from wild type with those from Lpr-cg mouse bone marrow. Using both co-immunoprecipitation of Fas by gel-conjugated CaM antibody and CaM-Sepharose 4B pull down, we detected less CaM/Fas binding in lysates from Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts (Fig. 5, B and C) compared with those from wild-type mice. Therefore, the DD of Fas is critical for CaM/Fas binding both in vitro and in vivo. Enhanced Apoptosis by CaM Antagonists in Fas-mutated Cells—CaM antagonists induce more apoptosis in Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts than in osteoclasts from wild-type mice. To investigate the impact of CaM/Fas binding on apoptosis induced by CaM antagonists, we treated osteoclasts derived from both wild-type and Lpr-cg mice with various concentrations of TFP and TMX. The CaM antagonists induced apoptosis concentration-dependently in both wild-type and Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts. However, the Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts were more sensitive to CaM-antagonist-induced apoptosis than wild type. Treatment with TMX, 10 μm, caused 27 ± 2.2% of the wild-type osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis; in comparison, 42 ± 6% of the Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts became apoptotic after TMX treatment. This represents a 1.6 ± 0.2-fold increase in apoptosis (apoptosis rate in Lpr-cg/apoptosis rate in wt). Similarly, TFP (10 μm)-induced apoptosis is increased 1.6 ± 0.2-fold in Lpr-cg-derived osteoclasts (37 ± 0.8% apoptotic cells) compared with wild type (24 ± 2.8% apoptotic cells) (Fig. 6). The basal apoptosis levels in Lpr-cg and wild-type-derived osteoclasts are not statistically different. Results were confirmed by measuring the activation of caspase-3 (data not shown). In contrast to the Lpr-cg mouse, which expresses a mutated inactive Fas molecule, the Lpr mouse has diminished Fas expression due to the insertion of an early transposable element in the Fas gene (6Adachi M. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). When osteoclasts derived from Lpr mice were treated with the CaM antagonists, TMX, 10 μm, or TFP, 10 μm, caspase-3 activation was increased 2.1 ± 0.6-fold and 1.3 ± 0.1-fold, respectively, compared with wild type (data not shown). This result suggests that disruption of CaM/Fas binding sensitizes osteoclasts to CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis. Promoting apoptosis in osteoclasts is potentially an important therapeutic strategy for treating osteolysis. We reported previously that osteoclast apoptosis is regulated by the Fas system. However, RANKL decreases Fas expression and Fas-mediated apoptosis, and in most osteolytic situations RANKL is up-regulated (7Wu X. McKenna M.A. Feng X. Nagy T.R. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5545-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 8Wu X. Pan G. McKenna M.A. Zayzafoon M. Xiong W.-C. McDonald J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify other mechanisms by which osteoclast apoptosis is regulated, especially under osteolytic conditions. CaM, a small calcium-binding protein, recognizes different target proteins, including enzymes, receptors, G-proteins, and transcription factors (30Lee A. Wong S.T. Gallagher D. Li B. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar, 31Liao B. Paschal B.M. Luby-Phelps K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6217-6222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Zuhlke R.D. Pitt G.S. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Reuter H. Nature. 1999; 399: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), thus regulating signaling and function in a variety of cells, including osteoclasts. In osteoclasts, CaM participates in the regulation of both formation and function (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Williams J.P. Blair H.C. McKenna M.A. Jordan S.E. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12488-12495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the role of CaM in regulating osteoclast apoptosis is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis by CaM antagonists and a dynamic interaction between CaM and Fas in mature osteoclasts. A point mutation in the DD of the Fas molecule that abolishes Fas-mediated apoptosis also abolishes the binding between Fas and CaM. The disruption of CaM/Fas binding sensitizes osteoclasts to CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis. CaM participates in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis and of osteoclastic bone resorption. A downstream target of CaM, the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway is essential for osteoclastogenesis (17Takayanagi H. Kim S. Koga T. Nishina H. Isshiki M. Yoshida H. Saiura A. Isobe M. Yokochi T.

Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13984-13992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CaM by the specific antagonist, TFP, inhibits osteoclastogenesis at an early stage of differentiation (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CaM is enriched at the acid-secreting ruffled membrane, where the H+-ATPase, an essential apparatus for osteoclastic bone resorption, is located. In avian osteoclasts, TMX inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption functioning as a CaM antagonist (19Williams J.P. Blair H.C. McKenna M.A. Jordan S.E. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12488-12495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), possibly by inhibiting the H+-ATPase (34Williams J.P. McKenna M.A. Thames 3rd, A.M. McDonald J.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 78: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CaM is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis in many cell types (35Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Cell Calcium. 1998; 23: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). An in vivo study showed that treatment with TFP rescues the bone loss in ovariectomized mice (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to the known inhibitory effects on osteoclast formation and bone resorption, the antiresorptive effect of CaM antagonists could result from the induction of osteoclast apoptosis. CaM antagonists mediate apoptosis in a cell-specific manner. For example, TMX and TFP exert an anti-apoptotic effect in HIV-infected CD4(+) T cells (36Pan G. Zhou T. Radding W. Saag M.S. Mountz J.D. McDonald J.M. Immunopharmacology. 1998; 40: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and pro-apoptotic effects in breast cancer cells (37Frankfurt O.S. Sugarbaker E.V. Robb J.A. Villa L. Cancer Lett. 1995; 97: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The maturation stage of the cells has an impact on the apoptotic response to CaM antagonists. In osteoclast precursors, TFP does not induce apoptosis (1Zhang L. Feng X. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4536-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) 3X. Wu and J. M. McDonald, unpublished observations.; however, in differentiated osteoclasts, CaM antagonists induce apoptosis and activate caspase-3 in concentration-dependent manners (Figs. 1 and 2). The demonstration of TMX- and TFP-induced apoptosis in osteoclasts suggests that CaM is protective, revealing another possible mechanism by which CaM antagonists inhibit bone resorption, by inducing osteoclast apoptosis. CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis activates caspase-3 in osteoclasts. Caspase-3 is a member of a family of cysteine proteases that cleave substrates after an Asp residue. In the breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT-20, 5 μm TMX activates caspase-3 in a time-dependent manner, preceding the appearance of apoptotic morphology (38Mandlekar S. Kong A.N. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 has been reported to be activated during Fas-mediated apoptosis in osteoclasts (7Wu X. McKenna M.A. Feng X. Nagy T.R. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5545-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here, by both Western blot analysis and a fluorescent caspase-3 assay, we demonstrate that CaM antagonists activate caspase-3 in osteoclasts. Cross-talk between the Fas and CaM pathways is of interest in many systems and is the focus of our ongoing investigations in many cells. The direct interaction between Fas and CaM regulates both the Fas and the CaM pathways. CaM interacts with a variety of proteins and serves diverse functions. Fas also interacts with various proteins, including the Fas-associated phosphatase-1 and FADD, both of which participate in the regulation of apoptosis (9Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar, 10Sato T. Irie S. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, the binding of CaM to the Fas DD is altered during Fas-mediated apoptosis. Fas activating antibody treatment first up-regulates (at 30 min) and then down-regulates (at 60 min) the binding between Fas and CaM (2Ahn E.Y. Lim S.T. Cook W.J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5661-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), suggesting that this interaction regulates Fas signaling, possibly by binding to cFLIP, the inhibitory molecule in the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway (2Ahn E.Y. Lim S.T. Cook W.J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5661-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In osteoclasts, CaM binds to the Fas DD, and this binding has an impact on CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis. Osteoclasts derived from Lpr-cg mice with a point mutation, I225N, in the mouse Fas DD (5Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 29Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have less CaM/Fas binding than those generated from wild-type mice. Furthermore, CaM antagonists induce apoptosis probably in part by interfering with CaM/Fas binding. Treatment of osteoclasts derived from RAW264.7 cells with 10 μm TFP caused a decrease in CaM/Fas binding at 15 min, which gradually recovered over 60 min. Treatment with various concentrations of TFP for 15 min in RAW264.7-derived osteoclasts decreased CaM/Fas binding dose-dependently. This suggests that in osteoclasts from control mice, Fas decreases CaM antagonist binding to CaM by competitively binding to CaM; however, in osteoclasts from Lpr or Lpr-cg mice, the deficiency in CaM-Fas binding allows more binding of CaM to CaM antagonists, thus sensitizing osteoclasts from these mice to CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis. To support this hypothesis, we generated osteoclasts from both strains of mutant mice, Lpr and Lpr-cg, which are deficient in Fas signaling due to lack of Fas expression and expression of nonfunctional Fas, respectively (5Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 6Adachi M. Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 39Kimura M. Matsuzawa A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 11: 193-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and showed greater induction of apoptosis and increased caspase-3 activation in response to the CaM antagonists, TMX and TFP, compared with wild-type osteoclasts (Fig. 6). Therefore, the decrease in Fas/CaM binding enhances CaM antagonist-induced osteoclast apoptosis. The exact mechanism by which Fas affects CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis requires further study. CaM antagonists are potentially an effective treatment for osteoporosis. Both post-menopausal osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis are associated with increased levels of RANKL, which down-regulates Fas expression and Fas-mediated apoptosis in osteoclasts (8Wu X. Pan G. McKenna M.A. Zayzafoon M. Xiong W.-C. McDonald J.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decreased Fas-mediated apoptosis in osteoclasts contributes to exacerbated bone loss. This is consistent with the report that defective Fas-mediated apoptosis of osteoclasts in Lpr mice leads to an osteopenic phenotype (7Wu X. McKenna M.A. Feng X. Nagy T.R. McDonald J.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5545-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The reduced levels of Fas lead to decreased CaM/Fas binding resulting in an increased response to CaM antagonists. This observation suggests that the level of Fas expression and the degree of binding to CaM regulate the sensitivity of the response of osteoclasts to CaM antagonists. Therefore, we speculate that CaM antagonists may be therapeutic agents for osteoporotic bone without affecting normal bone. Further study comparing the levels of CaM antagonist-induced apoptosis in osteoclasts differentiated in vitro, in the presence of different concentrations of RANKL, is important, and animal models such as the ovariectomized Lpr or Lpr-cg mice will be invaluable for further investigation of the significance of CaM/Fas binding in osteoclasts."

However, most of the antiapoptotic substrates of MAPK remain to be identified. Here we report that, upon interleukin-3 stimulation of Ba/F3 cells, the transcription factor GATA-1 is strongly phosphorylated at residue serine 26 by a MAPK-dependent pathway. Phosphorylation of GATA-1 increases GATA-1-mediated transcription of the E4bp4 survival gene without significantly changing the DNA-binding affinity of GATA-1. Further characterization of GATA-1 phosphorylation site mutants revealed that the antiapoptotic function of GATA-1 is strongly dependent upon its phosphorylation at the Ser-26 position and is probably mediated through its up-regulation of Bcl-XL expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that MAPK-dependent GATA-1 phosphorylation is important for its transactivation of the E4bp4 gene, Bcl-XL expression and cell survival. Therefore, GATA-1 may represent a novel MAPK substrate that plays an essential role in a cytokine-mediated antiapoptotic response.

Therefore, GATA-1 may represent a novel MAPK substrate that plays an essential role in a cytokine-mediated antiapoptotic response. GATA-1, the founding member of the GATA family of transcription factors, was initially identified as an erythroid-specific nuclear protein that binds to consensus GATA motifs, (A/T)GATA(A/G), present in various erythroid regulatory gene promoters, enhancers, and locus control regions (1Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1989; 58: 877-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2Tsai S.F. Martin D.I. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). GATA-1 is expressed in several tissues and participates in the transcriptional regulation of most erythroid and megakaryocytic expressed genes (3Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shivdasani R.A. Fujiwara Y. McDevitt M.A. Orkin S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3965-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating differentiation, GATA-1 may also control cell survival. In GATA-1–/– erythroid precursors, cellular maturation is accompanied by apoptosis, suggesting a role of GATA-1 in cell survival (5Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9623-9627Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 6Pevny L. Lin C.S. D'Agati V. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Development. 1995; 121: 163-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that the Bcl-x gene has two GATA consensus motifs in the 5′ promoter region (7Grillot D.A. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), and ectopic expression of GATA-1 induces the expression of Bcl-X in GATA-1–/– l erythroid progenitor cells (8Gregory T. Yu C. Ma A. Orkin S.H. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 87-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GATA-1 also suppresses IL 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ER, estrogen receptor; GER, GATA-1-ER; S26EER, GATA-1S26E-ER; S26AER, GATA-1S26A-ER; ERK, extracelluar signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.-6-induced apoptosis and up-regulates the expression of Bcl-2 in M1 myeloid cells (9Tanaka H.

Moreover, GATA elements are found in the promoters of other antiapoptotic genes such as nitric-oxide synthase (10Keinanen R. Vartiainen N. Koistinaho J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Zhang R. Min W. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6290-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, GATA-1 may sustain the viability of terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells via a yet unidentified genetic pathway. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in modulating the activity of transcription factors in vivo. This post-translational modification rapidly modulates protein activity in response to changes in environmental conditions, metabolic activity, or hormonal signaling (13Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The effect on the activity of individual transcription factors is variable but includes a change in DNA binding, cellular localization, or the potential to interact with other transcription factors (13Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Crossley and Orkin (14Crossley M. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16589-16596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have characterized the phosphorylation sites of GATA-1 in MEL cells before and after Me2SO-induced differentiation. GATA-1 possesses six constitutive phosphorylation sites at serines 26, 49, 72, 142, 178, and 187 and one inducible site at serine 310 that responds to Me2SO treatment (14Crossley M. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16589-16596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is conflicting evidence regarding a role for phosphorylation of GATA-1 in influencing its DNA binding or transcriptional activity. In one study, no effect of phosphorylation of GATA-1 was found (14Crossley M. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16589-16596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in another study, the DNA binding of baculovirus-expressed human GATA-1 was reported to be sensitive to treatment by alkaline phosphatase (15Taxman D.J. Sonsteby S.K. Wojchowski D.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A more recent study showed that the level of GATA-1 phosphorylation increases after the induction of K562 cells with Me2SO and that phosphorylation increases the binding affinity of GATA-1 for a canonical binding site (16Partington G.A. Patient R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These seemingly conflicting data may stem from different model systems utilized in each study. In a previous study, we demonstrated that expression of the survival gene E4bp4 is transcriptionally regulated by IL-3 and that a GATA motif downstream of the major transcription initiation site is essential for E4bp4 expression in the IL-3 dependent Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell line (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that GATA-1 binds to the E4bp4 promoter in vivo and plays an important role in E4bp4 transcriptional activation. Furthermore, we showed that GATA-1 is involved in the antiapoptotic signaling of IL-3 (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since GATA-1 appears to mediate IL-3-dependent survival responses, defining the mechanisms by which the GATA-1 gene and protein are regulated by IL-3-dependent signaling should provide important clues regarding antiapoptotic mechanisms in committed cells. In this study, we explore the mechanism by which IL-3 regulates the function of GATA-1. We show that phosphorylation of GATA-1 by ERK mediates its transcriptional activity induced by IL-3. Mutation of the GATA-1 phosphorylation site inhibits its antiapoptotic function and induction of Bcl-XL. These data suggest that GATA-1 phosphorylation is essential for cell survival. Cell Cultures—Ba/F3 (murine IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line) cells and bone marrow-derived IL-3-dependent primary cells (18Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol.

Matushansky I. Rekhtman N. Han X. Skoultchi A.I. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6363-6369PubMed Google Scholar), GATA-1S26E-ER (S26EER), and GATA-1S26A-ER (S26AER) were maintained with 5 μg/ml puromycin as described by Rao et al. (21Rao G. Rekhtman N. Cheng G. Krasikov T. Skoultchi A.I. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For experiments involving kinase inhibition, PD98059 (final concentration, 50 μm), U0126 (50 μm), wortmannin (0.1 μm), LY294002 (50 μm), JIP-I (1 μm), rapamycin (50 μm), SB203580 (5 μm), and SB202190 (5 μm) were all purchased from Calbiochem. Estrogen (β-estradiol, E2257) was purchased from Sigma and was used at a final concentration of 0.1 μm. Western Blotting—Total cell lysates and nuclear extracts were prepared, fractionated, and visualized as described in the standard Western blot protocol described previously (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used to detect the expression of specific antigens. Anti-GATA-1 (N6), anti-Bcl-XL (M-125), anti-Bcl-2 (ΔC21), and anti-Bax (N-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-p-ERK1/2 and ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; anti-β-actin (AC-15) and FLAG (M2) were from Sigma. Anti-murine Mcl-1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. H.-F. Yang-Yen (Academia Sinica). The polyclonal rabbit anti-p-GATA-1 was raised against the synthetic peptide SALVSpSPSDSTGFC (where pS represents phosphoserine) by Bethyl Laboratories Inc. (Montgomery, TX) with no ability to recognize the control peptide SALVSSPSDSTGFC (data not shown). Phosphatase Treatment of Nuclear Extracts in Vitro—Nuclear extracts of Ba/F3 cells were prepared as described by Yu et al. (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with Dignam extraction buffer. Fifteen μg of extracts were used for each reaction, and 1 unit of protein phosphatase 2A (Upstate Group, LLC) was added to the extracts with or without 1 μm of okadaic acid (Calbiochem). The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Alternatively, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was added to the nuclear extract. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GATA-1 antibody (N6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmid Construction—The pGEX-3X-based Escherichia coli expression constructs that would direct the synthesis of the GST-tagged various deletions or point mutations of GATA-1 are listed in Table I. All point mutants of GATA-1 were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. For those constructs involving PCR or site-directed mutagenesis, the nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing. W1 is a mammalian expression vector expressing FLAG-tagged GATA-1. W1M1, W1M2, W1M3, W1M4, and W1M5 are identical to W1 except that they encode a mutant GATA-1 with alanine or glutamic acid substitution at the following residues as indicated: W1M1, with an S26A mutation (Ser-26 mutated to Ala); W1M2, with S26A, T101A, S107A, and T108A mutations; W1M3, with S26A, S170A, S174A, and T176A mutations; W1M4, with S-26A, T101A, S107A, T108A, S170A, S174A, and T176A mutations; and W1M5, with an S26E mutation.

Open table in a new tab Reporter Gene Assay—Ba/F3 or COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids by electroporation or Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen), and the cell lysates were assayed for the luciferase activity as previously described (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was isolated from Ba/F3 cells and bone marrow-derived IL-3-dependent primary cells of BALB/c mice with the TRIZOL reagent kit (Invitrogen). Approximately 30 μg of total RNA from each treatment were then subjected to the standard Northern blotting as previously described (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using probes specific to the E4bp4 or G3pdh gene. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with ERK1/2 antibody, and the immunocomplexes were analyzed for kinase activity according to the vendor's instruction (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). In some reactions, active recombinant ERK1 and ERK2 purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY; catalog number 14-439) were used to replace immunocomplexes in kinase reactions. Quantitation of Apoptotic Cells and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Analysis—Annexin V staining of the apoptotic cells (BioVision Research) was performed according to the vendor's instructions and was described previously (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Huang H.M. Li J.C. Hsieh Y.C. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The viability of cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Loss of mitochondria membrane potential was monitored by rhodamine 123 staining (24Lee S.F. Huang H.M. Chao J.R. Lin S. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7399-7409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-3 Induces Hyperphosphorylation of GATA-1—The genetic pathway of apoptosis is highly conserved throughout evolution from nematodes to humans (25Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Within the regulatory pyramid of this pathway, E4BP4 acts as one of the initial responses to extracellular stimulation, suppresses the suicidal reaction, and prevents cells from disintegration. We previously demonstrated that GATA-1 is a key regulator of the E4bp4 gene and is also an essential component of the antiapoptotic network of IL-3 in an IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line (17Yu Y.L. Chiang Y.J. Yen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27144-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this report, we sought to investigate how IL-3 regulates GATA-1, which in turn induces the expression of E4bp4. First we tested whether the protein level of GATA-1 is altered by IL-3. Western blot analyses of the total lysates of Ba/F3 cells with GATA-1-specific antibody revealed that the protein level of GATA-1 was rapidly decreased upon IL-3 stimulation at 10 min and then gradually returned to the base-line level (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–5). Interestingly, a slower migrating species of GATA-1 (M-GATA-1) is evident (Fig. 1A, top panel). Accumulation of this modified form of GATA-1 was maximal after 10–20 min of IL-3 induction (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1) and declined thereafter to the basal level (Fig. 1A, lane 5). The phosphorylation status and total protein levels of ERK1/2 were monitored during IL-3 stimulation (Fig. 1A, middle and bottom panels). The result shows that both GATA-1 modification and ERK1/2 phosphorylation events follow similar kinetics. GATA-1 protein levels were quantified by densitometer (Fig. 1B), and the results suggested that the level of total GATA-1 protein, including M-GATA-1 and GATA-1, is largely unchanged during IL-3 treatment, whereas the ratio between slower and normal migrating species varied. To investigate whether this IL-3-induced modification of GATA-1 mobility is due to phosphorylation, we treated nuclear extracts with protein phosphatase 2A or calf intestinal phosphatase. Extracts from cells not treated with IL-3 were included as a control (Fig. 1C, lane 1), showing the migration of GATA-1 in unstimulated cells. Protein phosphatase 2A or calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase treatment of nuclear extracts from IL-3-stimulated cells resulted in the disappearance of the slower migrating form of GATA-1 (indicated as p-GATA-1) and the appearance of a band that ran slightly faster than the unstimulated GATA-1 (indicated as GATA-1*) (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 2 and 4 in the middle panel). In the top panel, with fewer proteins loaded in the gel, the protein phosphatase 2A-treated product appeared to be a doublet, and the faster migrating GATA-1 (GATA-1*) presumably represents the hypophosphorylated form of GATA-1. Okadaic acid specifically inhibits protein phosphatase 2A and prevents the conversion of the hyperphosphorylated GATA-1 to the hypophosphorylated form (lane 4). When we treated the nuclear extracts with another potent protein phosphatase, λ-phage phosphatase, the same hypophosphorylated GATA-1 was observed (data not shown). These data suggested that GATA-1 is probably constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of IL-3 and rapidly becomes hyperphosphorylated upon IL-3 stimulation. According to previous reports, IL-3 activates GATA-2 through the ERK pathway in hematopoietic cells (26Towatari M. May G.E. Marais R. Perkins G.R. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. Enver T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4101-4107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GATA-4 also is phosphorylated by ERK in cardiomyocytes (27Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether GATA-1 also is phosphorylated via the MEK/ERK pathway during IL-3 treatment. Pretreatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059, but not the vehicle control (Me2SO), effectively blocked induction of GATA-1 hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1D, compare lane 2 with lane 3). Treatment with another MEK inhibitor, U0126, gave the same result (data not shown). However, unlike in vitro treatment with phosphatases (Fig. 1C), PD98059 treatment was not able to convert GATA-1 to the faster migrating form, suggesting that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway probably is involved in hyperphosphorylation but not in constitutive phosphorylation of GATA-1. MEK/ERK Pathway-dependent Induction of E4bp4 —To further investigate whether the MEK/ERK signaling pathway also mediates the induction of E4bp4 expression in response to IL-3, we examined the effect of various pharmacological agents on the activation of an E4bp4 promoter-reporter plasmid in Ba/F3 cells. In good agreement with the results in Fig. 1D showing that hyperphosphorylation of GATA-1 is completely blocked by the MEK inhibitors, we found that PD98059 and U0126 also completely blocked the IL-3-dependent induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2), whereas the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 had only a partial inhibitory effect or no effect, respectively (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6). Wortmannin has been shown to slightly inhibit MEK activity (28Ferby I.M. Waga I. Hoshino M. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11684-11688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, the partial inhibitory effect of wortmannin on the E4bp4 reporter may be due to inhibition of MEK instead of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor JIP-I had no effect (Fig. 2A, lane 7). In contrast, the p70 S6K inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 2A, lane 8) and the p38 MAPK inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190 (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10) slightly, but reproducibly, potentiated the effect of IL-3 on the E4bp4 reporter activity, suggesting that p70 and p38 may inhibit E4bp4 transcription. In order to further demonstrate the involvement of MEK/ERK activity in E4bp4 transcription, expression plasmids encoding dominant negative forms of several kinases were transfected along with the reporter construct into Ba/F3 cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, dominant negative mutants of MEK-1 (lane 3) and ERK1 (lane 4), but not that of AKT (lane 5), inhibited activation of the E4bp4 reporter gene by IL-3 (lanes 3–6). However, these suppressions were never greater than 50% even with much higher amounts of expression vectors used in the assay. The underlying mechanism of 50% suppression effect of dominant negative MEK1 and dominant negative ERK1 to the reporter gene activity is still unknown. We cannot rule out the possibility of technical limitation in exogenous gene expression. Alternatively, the involvement of kinases other than MEK1 and ERK1, like MEK5, in transducing IL-3 signal is another conceivable explanation. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the MEK1/ERK1 pathway is an important part of IL-3 induction of the E4bp4 gene. We next investigated whether the MEK/ERK pathway mediates IL-3 induction of endogenous E4bp4. Ba/F3 cells and bone marrow-derived primary IL-3-dependent cells were treated with or without kinase inhibitors prior to IL-3 stimulation, and total RNAs were isolated from these cells and subjected to Northern blot analysis. Both PD98059 and wortmannin blocked the IL-3-induced expression of E4bp4 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2, 3, and 6). These data reveal that the MEK/ERK pathway plays an important role in mediating the IL-3-induced expression of E4bp4. Ser-26 of GATA-1 Is the Major Inducible Phosphorylation Site—To investigate the role of phosphorylation in regulating the transcriptional function of GATA-1, we identified and then mutated the IL-3-inducible and constitutive phosphorylation sites in GATA-1. The coding sequence of GATA-1 was split into the N- and C-terminal fragments (plasmids D1 and D2 in Table I), which were each expressed as recombinant GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3A, D1 and D2). The recombinant proteins were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay with complexes immunoprecipitated by MAPK antibody from Ba/F3 cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 3B, the D1 fragment of GATA-1 was initially slightly phosphorylated in the absence of IL-3 and became highly phosphorylated upon IL-3 treatment (compare lane 1 with lane 2). In contrast, the D2 fragment was not phosphorylated in the presence or absence of IL-3 (lanes 4 and 3, respectively). These data suggested that both the constitutive and IL-3-inducible sites are probably located in the N-terminal domain of GATA-1. To further narrow down the location of phosphorylation site(s), the D1 peptide was split into three smaller peptides (see Table I, D3, D4, and D5) that were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3A, D3, D4, and D5) and then subjected to the in vitro kinase assay as shown in Fig. 3C. The D3 peptide was not phosphorylated with lysates prepared from IL-3-depleted cells (Fig. 3C, lane 1), but it was highly phosphorylated when cells were stimulated with IL-3 (Fig. 3C, lane 2), indicating that D3 peptide contains a strong inducible site(s) but not the constitutive site. Analysis of D4 and D5 recombinant proteins suggested that the D4 peptide contains a weak constitutive site(s) but not an inducible site (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 6), and the D5 peptide contains a minor inducible site(s) (Fig. 3C, lanes 9 and 10). To identify the phosphorylated amino acid residues in these peptides, alanine substitutions were introduced into these three peptides at putative MAPK substrate sites (29Clark-Lewis I. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15180-15184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or at phosphorylated residues identified by tandem mass spectrum analysis of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated D4 and D5 peptides (LCQ DECA XPPlus; ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Recombinant D3, D4, and D5 proteins containing single or combined point mutations were produced and subjected to the in vitro kinase reaction (see Table I). In the D3 peptide, alanine substitution at Ser-26 (Fig. 3A, D3M1) completely blocked the IL-3-inducible phosphorylation by MAPK immunocomplexes (Fig. 3C, compare lane 2 with lane 4). A combination of three single-point mutations at residues 101, 107, and 108 in the D4 peptide (Fig. 3A, D4M6) dramatically eliminated constitutive phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, lanes 5–8). Another combination of mutations at residues 170, 174, and 176 in the D5 peptide (Fig. 3A, D5M8) abolished the minor phosphorylation by IL-3-inducible MAPK immunocomplexes (Fig. 3C, compare lane 10 with lane 12). Taken together, these results suggest that under the in vitro kinase assay condition described above, candidate constitutive phosphorylation sites include Thr-101, Ser-107, and Thr-108; candidate minor IL-3-inducible sites include Ser-170, Ser-174, and Thr-176, and a major IL-3-inducible site resides at Ser-26. As shown in Fig. 3D, phosphorylation of the D3 peptide was completely inhibited in extracts of cells that were pretreated with PD98059 or U0126 (compare lane 2 with lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the major inducible site in the D3 peptide is most likely the substrate of kinases in the MEK/ERK pathway. ERK1/2 Directly Phosphorylates GATA-1 in Vitro—We next examined whether active, recombinant ERK can directly phosphorylate any of these sites mentioned above. In vitro kinase reactions of GATA-1 fragments were carried out using active recombinant ERK1 and ERK2 (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 3E, the D3 and D5 peptides were directly phosphorylated by both kinases (lanes 1, 5, 7, and 11), whereas the D3M1 and D5M8 peptides were resistant to these kinases (lanes 2, 6, 8, and 12), consistent with our observations using MAPK immunocomplexes (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the major site at Ser-26 and minor sites at Ser-170, Ser-174, and Thr-176 are all direct phosphorylation targets for MAPK in vitro. Interestingly, the D4 peptide was not phosphorylated by either ERK1 or ERK2 (Fig. 3E, lanes 3 and 9). Therefore, the kinase(s) that constitutively phosphorylates D4 peptide in the absence of IL-3 and is insensitive to the presence of PD98059 is unlikely to be a component"
https://openalex.org/W2051751077,"Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent signaling molecule that plays important roles in multiple and diverse developmental processes. The contribution of retinoic acid to promoting the development and differentiation of the vertebrate intestine and the factors that regulate RA production in the gut remain poorly defined. Herein, we report that the novel retinol dehydrogenase, rdh1l, is required for proper gut development and differentiation. rdh1l is expressed ubiquitously during early development but becomes restricted to the gut by 3 days postfertilization. Knockdown of rdh1l results in a robust RA-deficient phenotype including lack of intestinal differentiation, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous retinoic acid. We report that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutant zebrafish harbor an RA-deficient phenotype including aberrant intestinal differentiation and that these mutants can be rescued by treatment with retinoic acid or injection of rdh1l mRNA. Further, we have found that although APC mutants are deficient in rdh1l expression, they harbor increased expression of raldh2 suggesting the control of RA production by APC is via retinol dehydrogenase activity. These results provide genetic evidence that retinoic acid is required for vertebrate gut development and that the tumor suppressor APC controls the production of RA in the gut by regulating the expression of the retinol dehydrogenase, rdh1l.

Dietary vitamin A, retinol, is a major source of retinoids in vertebrates. Conversion of retinol into its active form, retinoic acid (RA), 1The abbreviations used are: RA, retinoic acid; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; RALDH, retinal dehydrogenase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; i-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; GRP, green fluorescent protein; hpf, hours postfertilization. 1The abbreviations used are: RA, retinoic acid; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; RALDH, retinal dehydrogenase; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; i-FABP, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; GRP, green fluorescent protein; hpf, hours postfertilization. is achieved via a two-step enzymatic process (1Duester G. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 459S-462SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first step, conversion of retinol into retinal, is catalyzed by retinol dehydrogenases (RDH), members of the short chain dehydrogenase-reductase family of enzymes. The second step, conversion of retinal to retinoic acid, is performed by retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDH). The RA signaling pathway is engaged when plasma retinol is absorbed by cells or liberated from the plasma membrane and converted via RDHs and RALDHs into RA. RA in turn binds to a subset of nuclear hormone receptors, RARs and RXRs, to effect gene expression changes (2Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Several studies indicate an important role for retinoids in maintenance of the normal gut epithelium and in tumor biology. For example, vitamin A-deficient animals display various colonic defects highlighted by decreased mucus production, expansion of crypt proliferative zones, and disrupted ion exchange (3Narisawa T.

Further, induction of colon carcinomas in rats by 5-azoxymethane is blocked by addition of retinoid analogs (3Narisawa T. Reddy B.S. Wong C.Q. Weisburger J.H.

A role for RA in the intestine is further supported by reports that treatment of colon cancer cell lines with retinoids induces markers of differentiation, inhibits cell growth, and reduces invasiveness (14Niles R.M. Wilhelm S.A. Thomas P. Zamcheck N. Cancer Investug. 1988; 6: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Reynolds S. Rajagopal S. Chakrabarty S.

Commun. 1999; 261: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, vitamin A-deficient rats are incapable of proper intestinal adaptation and response following small bowel injury (18Swartz-Basile D.A. Wang L. Tang Y. Pitt H.A. Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G424-G432Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Despite the data implicating RA in intestinal cell functions, a number of key issues remain unresolved. First, vitamin A deficiency in rodents does not appear to cause a complete loss of intestinal epithelial differentiation (3Narisawa T. Reddy B.S. Wong C.Q. Weisburger J.H. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 1379-1383PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nzegwu H. Levin R.J. Gut. 1991; 32: 1324-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 5Nzegwu H.C. Levin R.J. Gut. 1992; 33: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,9Zile M. Bunge C. Deluca H.F. J. Nutr. 1977; 107: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thus challenging the notion that vitamin A is essential for differentiation of the intestinal epithelium. Second, the importance of RDHs in RA biosynthesis in vivo remains in question due, in part, to the relatively mild phenotypes of various alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) mutants and double mutants compared with raldh2 null mice (19Duester G. Mic F.A. Molotkov A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143-144: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, reports of RDH-independent RA biosynthetic pathways suggest RDHs to be nonessential.An important recent finding links the regulation of RA biosynthesis to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in as many as 85% of human colon carcinomas (20Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jette C. Peterson P.W. Sandoval I.T. Manos E.J. Hadley E. Ireland C.M. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34397-34405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, retinol dehydrogenases were found to be reduced in human colon adenomas and adenocarcinomas carrying mutated APC. Introduction of wild type APC into colon tumor cells rescued the expression of the retinol dehydrogenase, RDHL, and increased cellular RA production.Our recent work (22Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) shows that knockdown of retinol dehydrogenase activity in vivo is sufficient to produce a robust phenotype characteristic of vitamin A deficiency in zebrafish. Further, the zebrafish intestine appears to depend upon RDHs and RA signaling for appropriate patterning and development. Specifically, the adult zebrafish intestine expresses the retinol dehydrogenase, rdh1 (formerly referred to as zRDHB), in a graded fashion anterior to posterior with the highest expression appearing in the adult anterior gut (22Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, abrogation of rdh1 in embryos appeared to affect only the anterior intestine, whereas the posterior intestine developed normally. This suggested two possibilities, (i) the posterior intestine does not require retinoic acid or (ii) a separate, posterior RDH is responsible for producing RA thus allowing proper development and differentiation of that intestinal segment in the absence of rdh1.We have now investigated the role of a second zebrafish retinol dehydrogenase, rdh1l (formerly referred to as zRDHA), in zebrafish gut development and patterning. We found that morpholino-mediated knockdown of rdh1l resulted in loss of differentiation in both the anterior and posterior intestine. The expression of gut markers trypsin and i-FABP were rescued in morphant embryos by application of RA, confirming rdh1l as an in vivo RDH and underscoring the role of retinoic acid in intestinal cell differentiation. Further, we have utilized APC genetic mutant zebrafish to ascertain whether rdh1l is controlled by APC in vivo. We found that APC mutants were deficient in rdh1l expression throughout the gut and that these mutants also lacked trypsin and i-FABP. Interestingly, APC mutant embryos displayed increased expression of raldh2, suggesting a specific role for APC in positively regulating RDHs. Consistent with a function for RA downstream of APC, APC mutants were rescued by exogenous RA treatment or by injection of rdh1l mRNA. These results suggest an essential role for APC regulation of retinoic acid production throughout the zebrafish intestine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESZebrafish Stocks and Embryo Culture—Wild type and APC mutant Danio rerio (zebrafish) were maintained on a 14:10-h light:dark cycle. Fertilized embryos were collected following natural spawnings and allowed to develop at 28.5 °C. Control and experimental embryos were raised in 0.003% phenylthiourea to inhibit pigment formation (23Westerfield M. The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish. University of Oregon Press., Eugene, OR1995Google Scholar).Whole Mount in Situ Hybridizations—Zebrafish embryos were fixed in sucrose-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in methanol, and stored at -20 °C. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for rdh1l, insulin, trypsin, and i-FABP were generated as described previously (22Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The raldh2 riboprobe was generated by linearization of pCRIV (Invitrogen) containing a raldh2 cDNA followed by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Whole mount in situ hybridizations were carried out as described previously (22Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Embryos were cleared in 70% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and photographed using an Olympus DP12 digital camera.RT-PCR—Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR primers used were as follows: rdh1l exonic primers, forward, 5′-GCTGCATCTGGATGTGACTG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTCGACCCTTGGCTTTCTT-3′; rdh1l intronic primers, forward, 5′-CCGTCCGTCCATTTATCCTA-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGATGGTCAGACGGATAGA-3′. β-Actin primers were as described previously (22Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Quantitative RT-PCR—Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the Roche Light Cycler instrument and software, version 3.5 (Roche Diagnostics). Primers were as follows: trypsin, forward, 5′-ATGAAGGCTTTCATTCTTCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGGGGTGTCTGATGACTTTTT-3′; raldh2, forward, 5′-ATCCAAGAAGCAGCAGGAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGGTCCGTGTTCAGTGGTT-3′.PCRs were performed in duplicate using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics). PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of amplification with a 10-s denaturation at 95 °C, 5 s of annealing at 57 °C, and a 10-s extension at 72 °C. A template-free negative control was included in each experiment.Morpholino and RNA Injections—Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were obtained from Gene Tools LLC. The rdh1l MO splicing blocking morpholino (5′-TCTGTCAGTGACTCACCCTTCTGTC-3′), rdh1l MO2 translation-blocking morpholino (5′-TATATTGTCAGCTTTCAGAGTGGAG-3′), and control morpholino (5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′) were solubilized to 1 mm in 1× Danieau buffer. For microinjections, 0.5 nl of a 0.5 mm morpholino solution was injected into zebrafish embryos at the one- to two-cell stages.For RNA injection experiments, full-length rdh1l RNA was synthesized from a linearized pCRII/rdh1l construct using mMessage mMachine (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Full-length rdh1l or GFP RNAs were injected into embryos at the one-cell stage.RA Rescue Experiments—To rescue rdh1l morphants and APC mutants by application of retinoic acid, embryos were incubated in 900 nm all-trans-retinoic acid in Me2SO at 75% epiboly for 1 h. Embryos were then washed in embryo water. At 30 and 54 hpf embryos were treated with 20 nm all-trans-retinoic acid for one h then washed in embryo water. Control embryos were treated over these periods with an equal volume of Me2SO.Histological Analyses—Embryos were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and embedded in paraffin. Six-micron sections were cut using a Leica microtome and stained in hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were analyzed using an Olympus compound microscope, and pictures were taken using a Zeiss Axiocam.RESULTSDevelopmental Expression Pattern of rdh1l—To characterize the role of rdh1l in the developing zebrafish, we first sought to analyze its expression pattern at various time points. To this end, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization on 6, 14, 24, 36, and 96 hpf zebrafish embryos using an antisense probe against rdh1l (Fig. 1). We found rdh1l transcripts to be present throughout the embryo at 6 hpf with increased intensity in the migrating mesendoderm. During early segmentation (14 hpf) rdh1l maintained a ubiquitous expression pattern with particularly strong expression in the developing somites. At 24 and 36 hpf rdh1l expression remained ubiquitous with increased intensity in the developing eye, hindbrain, pectoral fins, branchial arches, and presumptive macrophages (Fig. 1). By 96 hpf rdh1l expression was localized to the gut tube of developing larvae, and positive staining was also noted in the liver (Fig. 1). A control probe for neomycin showed no staining in any structures at any of these time points (data not shown).rdh1l Is Required for Jaw, Fin, and Gut Development—We previously determined that cells transfected with rdh1l and treated with retinol were capable of producing 3-fold more retinoic acid than control cells thereby verifying rdh1l as a bona fide retinol dehydrogenase in vitro (22Nadauld L.D. Sandoval I.T. Chidester S. Yost H.J. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51581-51589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether rdh1l acts as a retinol dehydrogenase in vivo, we sought to abrogate rdh1l function in developing zebrafish embryos using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides. We designed a splicing-blocking morpholino (rdh1l MO) against the exon1 splice-donor site of rdh1l to block splicing and effectively abrogate rdh1l activity. RT-PCR using primers targeted to exonic and intronic rdh1l sequences revealed that rdh1l MO greatly reduced the amount of correctly spliced transcript and increased the presence of an unspliced transcript (Fig. 2A). A control morpholino had no effect on rdh1l splicing. Reverse transcription reactions performed without the transcriptase enzyme ruled out the possibility of genomic DNA contamination (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Morpholino knockdown of rdh1l causes developmental defects that are rescued by retinoic acid. Wild type zebrafish embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with a control or a splicing-blocking morpholino targeted against rdh1l mRNA. A, total RNA was isolated from injected larvae at 4 days postfertilization. RT-PCR with primers targeted to exon and intron sequences within rdh1l distinguish spliced (upper panel) from unspliced (middle panel) transcripts. Lane 1, control morpholino; lane 2, control morpholino with no reverse transcriptase (RT); lane 3, rdh1l morpholino; lane 4, rdh1l morpholino with no RT; lane 5, no input. Amplification of β-actin verifies equal amounts of input cDNA (lower panel). B, the gross phenotype of a 96 hpf rdh1l morphant (right panel), compared with a control morpholino-injected larva (Con MO, left panel), is characterized by small eyes, lack of jaw (arrow) and pectoral fin formation, and pericardial edema. C, injection of one-cell stage embryos with a control morpholino had no effect on pectoral fin development (left panel). Treatment of rdh1l morphants with exogenous RA partially rescued pectoral fin (right panel), whereas treatment with vehicle (Me2SO) did not (center panel). Arrows indicate pectoral fins.

Similar phenotypes were seen upon injection of a translation-blocking morpholino targeted to the ATG start of the rdh1l mRNA (data not shown). To verify rdh1l as a gene involved in retinoic acid production, we sought to rescue fin formation in rdh1l morphants by the addition of exogenous retinoic acid. To accomplish this, we injected one-cell stage embryos with rdh1l MO followed by treatment with vehicle or all-trans-retinoic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At 96 hpf, only 6% (n = 119) of morphants treated with Me2SO vehicle developed pectoral fins (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, ∼60% (n = 104) of rdh1l morphants treated with RA developed pectoral fins (Fig. 2, C and D).In addition to the developing jaw and fin, the zebrafish pancreas and intestine have been described as requiring retinoic acid for proper development and differentiation (22Nadauld L.D.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1215-1220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To determine whether these structures were additionally affected in rdh1l morphants, we performed whole mount in situ hybridization for trypsin and i-FABP, markers of differentiated exocrine pancreas and intestine, respectively. Consistent with a retinoic acid-deficient phenotype, we found that rdh1l morphants displayed a severe decrease in trypsin expression (Fig. 3A). To quantitate the decrease in trypsin expression we performed qRT-PCR using total RNA isolated from rdh1l morphant embryos at 80 hpf. This analysis revealed trypsin expression in rdh1l morphants to be ∼9% of that found in control embryos (Fig. 3B). The addition of RA to rdh1l morphants restored trypsin expression to nearly double the expression of trypsin. Similarly, by whole mount in situ hybridization, we noted that i-FABP expression was present in only 10% (n = 70) of rdh1l morphants (Fig. 3, A and C). Further, treatment with RA restored i-FABP expression in 42% (n = 43) of rdh1l morphants.Fig. 3Morpholino knockdown of rdh1l blocks pancreas and gut differentiation but is rescued by retinoic acid. Wild type zebrafish embryos were injected with a control (left panels) or a rdh1l-targeted morpholino (middle and right panels). A, at 96 hpf morphant larvae were harvested and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes for trypsin (upper panels) and i-FABP (lower panels), markers of differentiated exocrine pancreas and gut, respectively. B, qRT-PCR was performed using total RNA harvested from 80-hpf control and rdh1l morphants to measure levels of trypsin expression. The bar graph indicates the percentage of trypsin expressed in rdh1l morphants compared with control wild type embryos (calculated as rdh1l morphant trypsin levels/control morphant trypsin levels × 100%) following the indicated drug treatments. C, the bar graph depicts the percentage of morphants that stained positive for i-FABP following the indicated drug treatment. *, denotes statistical significance with a p value < 0.002 as determined by a chi-squared test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)rdh1l Morphant Intestines Phenocopy Neckless and APC Mutant Intestines—We reported previously that knockdown of another retinol dehydrogenase, rdh1, prevented epithelial differentiation only in the anterior intestine of developing zebrafish, whereas knockdown of APC impaired differentiation throughout the intestine. Because rdh1 expression was confined to the anterior gut and because rdh1l is expressed throughout the gut, we reasoned that rdh1l may provide the retinoic acid for proper development of the posterior gut. To determine which portion, if any, of the intestine was affected in rdh1l morphants compared with APC mutants, we harvested 96 hpf rdh1l morphants and APC mutants for sectioning and hematoxylin and eosin staining. We found that rdh1l morphants and APC mutants had formed a gut tube, which was lined by a single layer of cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, both types of embryos expressed GATA-6 and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α, markers of patterned, immature endoderm (26Wallace K.N. Pack M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 255: 12-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Morrisey E.E. Tang Z. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Jiang F. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S.

Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4785-4794PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D and data not shown). However, compared with control-injected embryos, rdh1l morphant and APC mutant intestines lacked wild type morphological characteristics, including developing villi and columnar epithelial cells (Fig. 4A). These defects were present along the entire anteroposterior gut axis (Fig. 4A) in rdh1l morphants and APC mutants.Fig. 4rdh1l knockdown affects intestinal development and differentiation. Control and experimental larvae were fixed, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin at 80 hpf to analyze gut development. A, sections from the foregut (left panels), midgut (middle panels), and hindgut (right panels) were compared from control injected morphants (top panels), rdh1l morphants (middle panels), or APC mutants (bottom panels). B, the number of cells comprising the intestinal bulb of the 80-hpf larval intestine was determined by counting the number of nuclei present in the single-cell layer of at least five rdh1l morphant, APC mutant, and wild type zebrafish. C, APC mutant (mt) larvae (right panels) or wild type (wt) APC siblings (left panels) were harvested at 80 hpf and in situ hybridized with antisense probes for i-FABP (top panels) or trypsin (bottom panels). D, whole mount in situ hybridization with an antisense probe for GATA-6 was performed on wild type APC siblings (left panels), APC mutants (middle panels), and rdh1l morphants (right panels) at 80 hpf.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The rdh1l morphant and APC mutant intestine also revealed an apparent reduction in cell number comprising the intestine compared with wild type intestines. Upon further investigation, we determined that 80 hpf wild type larval intestines maintained an average of 46 cells/tube at the intestinal bulb, whereas rdh1l and APC mutant intestines were composed of ∼20 cells at the same anteroposterior position in the gut tube (Fig. 4B). At 96 hpf the number of cells present in the rdh1l morphant gut remained at ∼20, suggesting that this defect was not simply because of a developmental delay (data not shown).Finally, we sectioned and stained 96-hpf neckless (nls) zebrafish larvae that are deficient in RA signaling because of a mutation in the retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, raldh2 (24Begemann G. Schilling T.F. Rauch G.J. Geisler R. Ingham P.W. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3081-3094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Grandel H. Lun K. Rauch G.J. Rhinn M. Piotrowski T. Houart C. Sordino P. Kuchler A.M. Schulte-Merker S. Geisler R. Holder N. Wilson S.W. Brand M. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 2851-2865PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to rdh1l morphants, nls mutant intestines lacked developing villi and columnar cells and appeared to have a fewer number of cells lining the gut tube compared with control 96-hpf larvae (data not shown).APC Mutants Display Decreased rdh1l and Increased raldh2 Expression—The striking similarities in the gross and molecular phenotypes between APC mutants and RA-deficient morphants led us to ask whether the APC mutants lacked expression of the RA biosynthetic enzymes. Therefore, we performed in situ hybridization with antisense probes for rdh1l and raldh2 in APC mutant larvae. At 72 hpf, rdh1l expression is strong in the gut and liver of wild type APC siblings. However, rdh1l expression in APC mutants was not detectable (Fig. 5A). In contrast, raldh2 expression was robust in wild type APC siblings and appeared to intensify in APC mutants (Fig. 5A). To verify and quantitate these apparent changes in expression levels, we performed qRT-PCR using total RNA from 72-hpf APC mutants. Using primers specific for rdh1l, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a 3.9-fold decrease of rdh1l expression levels in APC mutants (Fig. 5B). By comparison, raldh2 expression increased 4.2-fold in APC mutants.Fig. 5APC mutants display decreased rdh1l expression and increased raldh2 expression. A, in situ hybridization was performed on APC mutants (mt) (right panels) and wild type (wt) siblings (left panels) at 80 hpf with digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes for rdh1l (top panels) and raldh2 (bottom panels). B, qRT-PCR was performed using total RNA harvested from 80-hpf APC mutants and wild type siblings to measure levels of rdh1l and raldh2 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2060432010,"Integrins are modular (αβ) heterodimeric proteins that mediate cell adhesion and convey signals across the plasma membrane. Interdomain motions play a key role in signal transduction by propagating structural changes through the molecule, thus controlling the activation state and adhesive properties of the integrin. We expressed a soluble fragment of the human integrin β2 subunit comprising the plexin-semaphorin-integrin domain (PSI)/hybrid domain/I-EGF1 fragment and present its crystal structure at 1.8-Å resolution. The structure reveals an elongated molecule with a rigid architecture stabilized by nine disulfide bridges. The PSI domain is located centrally and participates in the formation of extended interfaces with the hybrid domain and I-EGF1 domains, respectively. The hybrid domain/PSI interface involves the burial of an Arg residue, and contacts between PSI and I-EGF1 are mainly mediated by well conserved Arg and Trp residues. Conservation of key interacting residues across the various integrin β subunits sequences suggests that our structure represents a good model for the entire integrin family. Superposition with the integrin β3 receptor in its bent conformation suggests that an articulation point is present at the linkage between its I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 modules and underlines the importance of this region for the control of integrin-mediated cell adhesion.

Integrins are heterodimeric adhesion proteins that transmit signals across the plasma membrane in both directions, thus serving as communication molecules between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6888) Google Scholar). Integrin α and β subunits associate non-covalently forming a “head” at one extremity of the molecule that binds ligands and two leglike extensions, each with a single pass transmembrane helix that anchors the integrin molecule to the plasma membrane, followed by two short cytoplasmic C-terminal tails (2Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ectodomain of the integrin αVβ3 revealed its modular architecture (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 4Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Interaction between the β-propeller of the α subunit and the I-like domain (also referred to as βA domain) of the β subunit forms the head that contains the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand binding site (5Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout. M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). In addition, the α subunit leg contains three β-sandwich domains. The β subunit leg comprises a hybrid domain, a PSI 1The abbreviations used are: PSI, plexin-semaphorin-integrin domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; I-EGF, integrin-epidermal growth factor domain; PHE1, PSI/hybrid domain/I-EGF1 segment; r.m.s., root mean square; SIRAS, single isomorphous replacement method using anomalous scattering. domain, and four I-EGF-like repeats followed by a β-tail domain at its C-terminal end (Fig. 1). In the αVβ3 integrin crystal structure, the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 domains are not resolved, and only poor electron density is present for the I-EGF3 domain with a very high average temperature factor (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Thus, both the three-dimensional structure of the I-EGF1 and its interactions with the flanking domains of the hybrid, PSI, and I-EGF2 domains are currently unknown. Conformational changes have been proposed to play an important role in the regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion (for a recent review, see Ref. 6Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Lateral clustering of integrins in the plasma membrane is an alternative model that has been put forward to account for the increase of their binding avidity for the ligands upon activation. These two models, however, are not mutually exclusive, and some coupling between these two integrin activation pathways has been suggested (7Hynes R.O. Science. 2003; 300: 755-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Li R. Mitra N. Gratkowski H. Vilaire G. Litvinov R. Nagasami C. Weisel J.W. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Bennett J.S. Science. 2003; 300: 795-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Quaternary structural changes have been compared with a “switchblade”-like motion, and a correlation between these conformers and the activation state, ligand affinity, and adhesive properties of the integrin molecules has been proposed (9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 10Liddington R.C.

Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This model for integrin activation is thus based on collective evidence from electron microscopy (12Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar), x-ray, and NMR studies of integrin fragments of one or several domains (9Xiao T. Takagi J.

Springer T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 14Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently the x-ray structure of the αIIbβ3 integrin head fragment in complex with ligand mimetics suggested that ligand binding may involve the outward swing of the hybrid domain with respect to the I-like (βA) domain and that the hybrid domain forms a rigid complex with the PSI domain (9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with previous observations from electron microscopic image analyses (12Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar) and the exposure of antibody epitopes in the hybrid and PSI domains upon integrin activation (14Lu C.

In the absence of a structure for the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 domains, however, it is not clear how the movement of the hybrid-PSI complex is connected to the leg of the β subunit. To address this question, we expressed a soluble fragment of the integrin β2 subunit consisting of the PSI, hybrid, and I-EGF1 domains and present a high resolution structure of these three domains (hereafter abbreviated PHE1). The PSI domain is located centrally in the structure and participates in the formation of extended interfaces with both the hybrid domain and I-EGF1 domains, respectively. The structure brings an important missing piece to the picture of the extracellular portion of the integrin receptor by suggesting that these three domains act as a rigid unit and that an articulation point is located between the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 modules of the integrin. Protein Expression and Purification—The cDNA coding for PHE1 was constructed from the wild type human β2 cDNA by removing the region encoding residues Lys101-Asn339, corresponding to the Θ-like domain insertion, and by adding a hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification followed by a stop codon after Glu460, which marks the C-terminal end of the I-EGF1 domain (17Takagi J.

The PCR product was inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector, and the plasmid was transfected into 293 cells. Stable cell lines were created by selection for G418 resistance. A single clone with high PHE1 expression was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium (JRH Biosciences). Typically 1 liter of culture supernatant was concentrated in a stirred cell (Amicon-8200, Millipore) through a polyethersulfone membrane with a 5-kDa molecular mass cutoff to a final volume of 50 ml in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol). 1.5 ml of packed of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic agarose beads (Qiagen) in a total of 5 ml was added to the sample, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and loaded onto an Econo column (Bio-Rad). After washing three times with a total of 15 ml of buffer A, the protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. The eluate was concentrated in buffer A to a final volume of 1 ml, and the sample was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (16 mm × 60 cm) mounted on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 2 mg of pure PHE1 protein (as assessed using SDS-PAGE) was obtained. The molecular mass of the sample was determined using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method. The precipitating solution contained 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m calcium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate at pH 6.5. 2 μl of the protein, concentrated by ultrafiltration to 20 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, were mixed with an equal volume of the precipitating solution, and the drop was equilibrated against a reservoir containing 1 ml of the precipitating solution at 18 °C. After macroseeding, crystals grew as thin plates over 2-3 days to dimensions of ∼0.05 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3. For data collection, crystals were prepared for cryocooling by soaking in the crystallization buffer to which 25% glycerol (v/v) had been added, mounted, and cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen gas stream (Oxford Cryosystems). Native diffraction intensities from a single cryocooled crystal were recorded on an ADSC charge-coupled device detector on the ID14-4 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). A potassium tetrachloroplatinate (K2PtCl4) derivative was collected on an R-axis IV++ Image Plate detector using CuKα radiation from a Micromax-007 rotating anode operating at 20 mA and 40 kV. Data were processed with the programs MOSFLM and SCALA (19Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and an initial map was calculated after solvent flattening. This initial map allowed the tracing of most of the main chain atoms of the hybrid and PSI domains. Phases calculated from the partial model combined with the experimental SIRAS phases were used to calculate a new map that was modified using the program DM (19Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

This result suggests that the proper folding of the I-like (βA) domain requires the interaction with the β-propeller of the associated α subunit of the integrin head. To avoid the complexity introduced by the I-like domain, we constructed a β2 subunit with the I-like domain deleted, β2ΔI. When transfected to COS-7 cells, surface expression was detected using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (15Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As expected, the β2ΔI subunit failed to associate with the αL subunit (15Tan S.M. Robinson M.K.

The β2ΔI subunit was truncated after the I-EGF1 domain to yield the PHE1 fragment containing the PSI, hybrid, and I-EGF1 domains. A stably transfected 293 clone was obtained to express the PHE1 fragment. The protein recovered from the culture supernatant was shown to express the conformational epitopes of MEM148, 7E4, KIM202, KIM89, and H52 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that it adopts a native conformation. Mass spectrometry analysis of PHE1 revealed a single species with a molecular mass of 29,677.3 Da, a value in excess of 4,300 Da over the calculated molecular mass of the polypeptide chain. After treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F, the molecular mass was reduced to the calculated value of the polypeptide, suggesting that the excess mass was due to glycosylation (Fig. 1C) Quality of the Model—The final model refined at 1.80-Å resolution includes 58 residues of the PSI domain, 120 residues of the hybrid domain, and 34 residues of the I-EGF1 domain (Fig. 2). The 4 residues (Ala-Lys-Leu-Ser) that connect the hybrid domain to the N- and C-terminal portions of the I-like (βA) domain insertion could not be traced in the electron density maps. Mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved protein crystals rules out proteolytic cleavage at this position. Thus, these residues are presumably mobile. Likewise 5 residues in the glycine-rich loop connecting strands βX with βA of the hybrid domain are not visible in the electron density map and were not included in the current model. A total of 219 well defined water molecules as well as two N-linked GlcNAc residues (Fig. 2A) and 2 histidine residues from the C-terminal His6 tag were placed (Fig. 1A). All residues from the model fall into favorable or allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram (Table I). Overall Architecture—The PHE1 segment adopts an elongated rodlike structure with overall dimensions of 82 × 30 × 30 Å. The structure is organized around three β-strands, βX, βA′, and βG, which form a central platform with the middle strand βA′ connecting back to strand βB in the hybrid domain, while strands βX and βG insert into the split PSI domain (see Figs. 1 and 2). The PSI domain is located centrally in the structure and makes extensive interactions with both the hybrid and I-EGF1 domains. Thus, the structure appears to be rather rigid and is further stabilized by nine disulfide bonds. A superposition of the PSI/hybrid tandem with the equivalent domains in the αIIbβ3 integrin structure (Protein Data Bank code 1TYE) gives a r.m.s. deviation of 2.2 Å for 169 equivalent Cα atoms. This illustrates that the relative orientation is well preserved between the hybrid and PSI domains of β2 and β3 integrins, an observation in agreement with the good conservation of the residues that form the interface (see below). The Hybrid Domain—The N- and C-terminal sequences flanking the I-like (βA) domain of integrin β2 (Fig. 1A) cluster in space and form the hybrid domain that adopts a β-sandwich fold. In the PHE1 construct, the I-like (βA) subunit is absent, and the 4 residues connecting to it are not resolved in the electron density map. Interestingly despite the absence of the whole I-like (βA) subunit, the β2 hybrid domain presented here superimposes well with the corresponding domain of the β3 integrin with a r.m.s deviation of 1.6 Å for 115 equivalent Cα atoms. This suggests that the I-like (βA) subunit does not influence the conformation of the hybrid domain and that other protein modules could be inserted at the same position, opening the possibility of creating chimeric receptor molecules. The loop connecting the βX and βA strands is significantly shorter in integrin β2 compared with the corresponding loops in β1, β3, β5, β6, and β7 integrins (Figs. 2 and 3) and is presumably flexible. In the β3 integrin structure, the same loop is longer and is stabilized through contacts with residues from the I-like (βA) domain (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L.

Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The PSI Domain—The PSI domains of integrin β2 and β3 have similar structures (4Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) with a residual r.m.s. deviation between the two domains of 1.8 Å for 54 equivalent Cα atoms after superposition. All four disulfide bridges, including the one between the second cysteine residue (Cys11 in integrin β2) and the cysteine following the hybrid domain (Cys425), are conserved and superimposable. However, differences exist between the two molecules. The N-terminal helix α1 present in β3 is missing in integrin β2, and an additional 3/10 helix and an α-helix, α3a, are present (Fig. 2A). An N-linked carbohydrate structure is present at Asn28 currently modeled as a single GlcNAc residue, although there is indication of an additional branched sugar residue. The I-EGF1 Domain—The I-EGF1 domain of the integrin β subunits was not resolved in previous structural studies, and our data provide the first view at atomic resolution of this domain. Unlike the integrin-EGF domains 2, 3, and 4 as well as those of the TIED (ten β-integrin EGF-like repeat domains) protein (17Takagi J. Beglova N. Yalamanchili P. Blacklow S.C. Springer T.A. Proc.

Genomics. 1999; 56: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that have 8 cysteine residues, the I-EGF1 structure β2 subunit has only a total of 6 cysteines engaged in three disulfide bonds (Figs. 3 and 4). The structure of I-EGF3 domain of the β2 subunit was determined by NMR, and the 8 cysteines were shown to arrange in the C1-C5, C2-C4, C3-C6, C7-C8 pattern (11Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment shows that I-EGF1 belongs to this group of EGF domains but with the C2-C4 disulfide pair missing and not to the laminin EGF domains that have the C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6, C7-C8 disulfide arrangement (17Takagi J. Beglova N. Yalamanchili P. Blacklow S.C. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A comparison with the I-EGF3 structure of the β2 integrin (11Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and the I-EGF4 structure of the β3 integrin (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) reveals that the absence of the second and fourth cysteine is accompanied by a large movement of the polypeptide chain (including the basic patch formed by Arg428, Arg432, and Arg434) that projects away from the central β-sheet formed by strands β1 and β2 (Fig. 4A). This is presumably partly due to the release of the structural constraint brought by the C2-C4 disulfide bridge in the I-EGF3 domains, which is absent in I-EGF1. Interestingly the closest structural homologue of I-EGF1 is the EGF domain of P-selectin (26Freedman S.J. Sanford D.G. Bachovchin W.W. Furie B.C. Baleja J.D. Furie B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13733-13744Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) whose polypeptide chain follows a similar path with 33 equivalent residues superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.7 Å (Fig. 4A). Interaction between Domains—The interactions between the PSI domain with the hybrid and I-EGF1 domains are stabilized through the formation of extensive interfaces of 815 and 1099 Å2, respectively. The interface between the PSI and hybrid domains in the integrin αIIbβ3 are similar with a comparable buried surface area of 860 Å2 and the involvement of a highly invariant Arg residue in multiple contacts with main chain atoms of the PSI domain in both cases (Fig. 5). The side chain of Arg86 (Arg93 in integrin β3 (9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar)) is deeply buried in the PSI/hybrid interface forming four hydrogen bonds with main chain atoms from Gly18, Pro19, Cys21, and Pro59. A water molecule trapped in the interface mediates an additional interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of the conserved Pro87 with the PSI domain. Thus the hybrid and PSI domains are held in a rigid orientation with respect to each other in both the β2 and β3 integrins, and given the strict conservation of the Arg86 residue, the relative orientation of these two domains is likely to be conserved in all integrins (Figs. 3 and 4). The PSI domain and I-EGF1 domains are also found to interact extensively. A list of interactions is given in Table III. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the guanido group of Arg39 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly446 and between Trp23 of the PSI domain and the carbonyl group of Cys445. Interestingly in addition to Cys445, the other 3 residues, namely Trp23, Arg39, and Gly446, are highly invariant among the β integrins sequences (Fig. 3), suggesting that the interface between PSI and I-EGF1 may also be well conserved. The compactness of the structure is further strengthened by the formation of the Cys11-Cys425 and Cys427-Cys445 disulfide bonds that maintain the potentially mobile linker region 423-427 of the PSI domain in close proximity with the bulk of the PSI and I-EGF1 domains, respectively (Fig. 2).Table IIIInteratomic contacts between the PSI and I-EGF1 domainsPSII-EGF1DistanceÅSer9 OArg449 Nϵ-22.9Trp23 Nϵ-1Cys445 O2.9Gln25 Oϵ-1Cys427 Cα3.2Gln25 Oϵ-1Cys427 Cβ3.1Gln25 Oϵ-1Arg428 N2.9Gln25 OGly446 Cα3.2Asn28 Oδ-1Asn458 Nδ-23.1Thr30 OLys457 Nζ3.1Arg39 NH2Gly446 O3.2 Open table in a new tab Taken together, the structural data presented here suggest that the PSI, hybrid, and I-EGF1 domains represent a rather rigid unit that may act as a lever to orientate the I-like (βA) domain with respect to the lower leg. However, the current evidence is partly based on the close match between the hybrid/PSI domains in only two experimentally determined structures (4Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), and more data are needed to resolve this issue. In contrast to the β3 integrin, the α-helix α1 is missing in our PHE1 β2 structure. Rather at its N terminus, the polypeptide chain of the β2 integrin PSI domain adopts an extended conformation. It would be interesting to see whether this conformation is preserved in the presence of an α subunit partner and the flanking I-EGF domains. Indeed a number of structural modifications are expected in the PSI and I-EGF1 domains in the context of an α subunit and the flanking I-EGF2 domain due to inter- and intrachain interactions. In particular, the assessment of the existence or not of a fourth β4 strand in the I-EGF1 module, which would form hydrogen bonds with the currently unpaired β3 strand (see Figs. 2 and 4), must await the structural determination of an integrin fragment comprising both the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 domains. Although the disulfide linkages are conserved in the integrin structures determined so far (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 11Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), several pairs of cysteine residues are found in close vicinity (e.g. Cys11-Cys425 is spatially close to Cys427-Cys445, and Cys3-Cys21 is close to Cys14-Cys40; see Fig. 2). Given small adjustment in the three-dimensional structure, their sulfhydryl groups are at the right distance to form alternate disulfide bonds. Thus, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an alternative disulfide arrangement that would introduce subtle alterations in the structure, possibly acting as relays to transduce signals. In our structure, which is devoid of the domains C-terminal to the I-EGF1, Ile455 is largely exposed to the solvent at the lower end of the molecule (Fig. 5). A hydrophobic residue is also found at the same position in integrins β1, β3, β5, and β7 (Fig. 3). It is thus probable that Ile455 of I-EGF1 makes contact with some hydrophobic residues protruding from the flanking I-EGF2 domain. Having defined the relative orientation of the hybrid, PSI, and I-EGF1 domains, what can we infer about the probable location of the I-EGF2 fragment? We performed a superposition of the PSI/hybrid domains of the PHE1 structure with the corresponding domains resolved in the bent conformation of the integrin αVβ3 structure (4Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40252-40254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Based on the resulting locations of the C-terminal end of the I-EGF1 domain and the N-terminal end of the I-EGF3, we observed that to join the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 segments together, these two modules must associate in antiparallel fashion, presumably exposing the long hydrophilic stretch present between cysteines C1 (Cys461) and C2 (Cys475) of the I-EGF2 module of the β2 integrin subunit at the tip of the molecule in its bent conformation (Fig. 6). This observation is in agreement with the extended model proposed for the I-EGF2/I-EGF3 tandem based on NMR data (9Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Two monoclonal antibodies that stimulate ligand binding to integrin α5β1 recognize epitopes located at the N terminus of the PSI domain, further emphasizing the importance of this region of the integrin molecule for signal transduction (16Mould A.P. Travis M.A. Barton S.J. Hamilton J.A. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Macdonald P.R. Kammerer R.A. Buckley P.A. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4238-4246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, a pathogenic hantavirus recognizes the PSI domain in its bent conformer, and this interaction was suggested to disturb vascular permeability by restricting integrin dynamics (27Raymond T. Gorbunova E. Gavrilovskaya I.N. Mackow E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that the bent conformers of αVβ3 (28Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and α5β1 (29Wei Y. Csekay R.-P. Robillard L. Kugler M.C. Zhang F. Kim K.K. Xiong J.P. Humphries M.J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 505-511Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar) can interact with ligands under appropriate conditions. These data point to the existence of several integrin conformers displaying subtle variations in terms of their activation states, thus emphasizing the importance of studies aimed at defining these structural states and how they correlate with integrin activation. In conclusion, one critical region for the transmission of structural changes with functional significance is located at the junction of the PSI, hybrid, and I-EGF1 domains with a linkage between I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 possibly acting as a conformational switch between the head and the legs of the β subunit of the integrin receptor. Our result point to this linker as an important region for regulating integrin-mediated cell adhesion. This hypothesis can now be tested by raising antibodies directed against peptides connecting the I-EGF1 and I-EGF2 modules and assessing their ability to interfere with integrin activation.

These p63 ΔN isoforms are expressed from an intronic cryptic promoter and demonstrate a dominant negative effect on the TA forms of p63 and also some moderate dominant negative behavior toward p53 (2Yang A.

Previously we have identified the HMG-1-like protein SSRP1 (structure-specific recognition protein) as a co-activator of p63 (6Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This co-activation by SSRP1 is also dependent on the N terminus of p63. Therefore it is apparent that this N-terminal domain of p63, similar to what is seen for p53 and p73, is essential for its transcriptional activity (7Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar, 8Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J.

Unlike p53, p63 is rarely mutated in cancer (10Michael D. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). p53 knock-out mice develop normally but have early onset of tumorigenesis (11Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J. Montgomery Jr., C.A. Butel J.S. Bradley A. Nature. 1992; 356: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). In contrast p63 knock-out mice die within days of birth and have severe developmental defects in limb formation and in epithelial stratification (12Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R.

Mutations in the p63 gene are associated with some human syndromes such as ectrodactyly, ectodermal dyslpasia, and cleft lip/palate syndrome and split hand split foot malformation syndrome, with some comparable phenotypes to those defects in p63-deficient mice (14Celli J.

However, the corresponding mutations in p53 are closely linked to human cancer development (18Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and cellular studies of the p53 family members suggest that these proteins play different roles during embryogenesis and development and in response to different cellular signals, although they are highly homologous and share a similar set of responsive genes. Thus it is important to elucidate which molecules regulate this family of proteins in cells. One group of p53 family regulators is p300/CBP. p300 and CBP (the CREB-binding protein) are distinct proteins encoded by two individual genes (19Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Both proteins often mediate transcription by binding to similar sets of transcriptional activators (21Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For this reason, these proteins are often referred to as p300/CBP. It has been shown that both p73 and p53 utilize p300 or CBP as their co-activators (24Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The acetyl-transferase activity of p300/CBP on histone and non-histone substrates is an important characteristic for its co-activator function (28Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Although how p300/CBP enhances transcription is not completely clear, two parallel mechanisms have been proposed, to bridge transcription factors to the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme and to acetylate histones around target promoters, which renders chromatin more open and accessible (28Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Grossman S.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2773-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Also, p300/CBP acetylates non-histone transcription factors such as p53 and p73 (32Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). By contrast and surprisingly our laboratory has previously shown that the acetylation of p73 by p300 appears to be dispensable for p73 transcriptional activity on p21 and Mdm2 expression (37Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but is necessary to specifically activate the expression of apoptotic genes such as p53AIP1 in response to DNA damage (38Costanzo A. Merlo P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V. Cole P.A. Fontemaggi G. Fanciulli M. Schiltz L. Blandino G. Balsano C. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Hence the difference in regulation of p53 and p73 by p300/CBP raises an obvious but enticing question of whether and how p63 is regulated by p300/CBP. In an attempt to address this question, we have conducted a series of biochemical and cellular studies. These studies indicate that p300 stimulates p63γ activity but not ΔN-p63γ activity, and this stimulation appears to require the acetyl transferase activity of p300. Plasmids and Antibodies—The pCDNA3-Myc-ΔN-p63γ plasmid was constructed using ΔN-p63γ cDNA (6Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Trink B. Okami K. Wu L. Sriuranpong V. Jen J. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 747-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and the reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR product of p63γ with primers 5′-TCCCCCGGGGATGTCCCA-GAGCACACAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTGGGTACACTGATCGGTT-3′ (inverse), respectively. The p63γ sequence was confirmed by automatic sequencing. pEGFP-C1 plasmid was purchased from Invitrogen. The monoclonal anti-p63 antibody (4A4), which recognizes p63γ and ΔN-p63γ, polyclonal anti-GFP, polyclonal anti-PCAF, and anti-p300 were all purchased from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal anti-FLAG and anti-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-p21waf1 antibodies were purchased from Neomarkers. Monoclonal anti-acetyl-lysine antibody and monoclonal anti-p300 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The monoclonal MDM2 antibody (4B11) was described previously (40Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Buffers—Lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. SNNTE buffer contained 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% sucrose. Radioimmune precipitation assay was comprised of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate. Acetylation Assay—Acetylation assays were carried out according to the published method (25Gu W. Shi X.L. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 37Zeng X.

The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol(v/v), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Na-butyrate, and [3H]acetyl CoA or 500 nm acetyl CoA (Sigma). Different amounts of p53, p63γ, PCAF, p300, and p300AT2 (see figure legends for the amount of proteins used in each reaction) were used in each assay. Acetylated p63γ was detected by either autoradiography or Western blot analysis using the monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Monoclonal anti-p63, monoclonal anti-p53, polyclonal anti-PCAF, and monoclonal anti-p300 antibodies were used to detect the corresponding protein levels. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 and lung small cell carcinoma H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Purification of His-p63γ, p300, p300AT2, and PCAF—His-p63γ wild type was PCR-cloned into the pET-30a vector and expressed and purified from bacteria using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads as described previously (42Keller D.M.

Cell. 2001; 7: 283-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). p300 and p300AT2 were purified from baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells using immunoaffinity columns as described (27Zeng X.

Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Transfection—H1299 cells (60% confluence on a 60-mm plate) or human embryonic kidney 293 cells (70% confluence on a 60-mm plate) were transfected with 3 μg of the parental pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C1-p63γ expressing plasmids by means of Lipofectin (Invitrogen), 6 h after transfection, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the plates replacing the transfection media. Cells were harvested 36-48 h posttransfection. Cell lysates were prepared as described (40Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

Construction of pHTO2p300Hyg—Construction of a plasmid expressing a p300 siRNA duplex was carried out as follows (44Kuninger D. Stauffer D. Eftekhari S. Wilson E. Thayer M. Rotwein P. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A 78-bp DNA fragment containing bp -97 to -25 of the human H1 promoter was generated by PCR of pBSM13(H15S) (45Hannon G.J.

This was followed by digestion with SacI and ScaI. 5′-Phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-CCCTATCAGTGATAGAGAA-3′ and 5′-CTAGTTCTCTATCACTGATAGGG-3′ containing operator O2 of Tn10 were annealed and ligated with the SacI ScaI-digested H1 promoter PCR fragment and cloned into SacI SpeI-digested pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) to generate pHTO2.5′-Phosphorylated oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGtgacacaggcaggcttgacTTCAAGAGagtcaagcctgcctgtgtcaTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAatgacacaggcaggcttgacTCTCTTGAAgtcaagcctgcctgtgtca-3′ containing human p300-specific 19 nucleotide-targeting sequences were annealed and ligated into the SpeI HindIII sites of pHTO2 to generate pHTO2p300. Finally, bp 3765-5045 of pTRE2hyg (BD Biosciences), containing the hygromycin resistance gene, were ligated into the Xho site of pHTO2p300 to generate pHTO2p300Hyg. Stable Line Construction and Cell Culture—The H1299-pHTO2p300 stable cell line was obtained by initial Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection of H1299 cells with the regulatory vector pcDNA6/TR. pcDNA6/TR expresses the tetracycline-repressor protein (TetR) from the CMV promoter. This vector confers resistance to blasticidin for potent selection of stable cell lines. Subsequently the H1299-pcDNA6/TR cell line was transfected as before with pHTO2p300Hyg. H1299 cells were cultured on plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 5 μg/ml blastocidin S (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem). Expression of the p300 siRNA in cells was induced upon addition of tetracycline to the media at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Transfection of siRNA p300-inducible Cell Lines—Tetracycline was added to the cells (50% confluence on a 60 mm plate) 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of the parental pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C1-p63γ expressing plasmids using Lipofectin. Six hours after transfection, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 μg/ml blastocidin S and 100 μg/ml hygromycin and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (to plates where p300 knockdown is being induced) was added to the plates replacing the transfection media. Sixteen hours posttransfection the tetracycline concentration was brought up to 5 μg/ml. Cells were harvested at 36 h posttransfection. Construction and Use of the p300 and p63γ Adenoviruses—A wild type human p300 cDNA and the AT2 mutant lacking histone acetyltransferase activity (37Zeng X. Lee H. Zhang Q. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 46Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) were previously used to generate recombinant adenoviruses with the adenase vector kit (Quantum Biotechnologies) (47Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Kuninger D.T. Rotwein P. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7453-7458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). GFP-tagged wild type p63γ and ΔN-p63γ were subcloned from plasmids described above and used to generate recombinant adenoviruses with this kit, with the same protocol as previously described (47Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Kuninger D.T. Rotwein P. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7453-7458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were co-infected with approximately equal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of two recombinant adenoviruses, one encoding a tetracycline-inhibited transactivator (Ad:tTA) and the other either Ad:FLAG-p300, Ad:FLAG-p300AT2, Ad:GFP-p63γ, or Ad:GFP-ΔN-p63γ or combinations of more than one of these viruses. Cells at ∼70% confluent density were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and an equal mixture of Ad:tTA virus and other viruses at an MOI that depends upon cell type. An equal volume of 20% fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added to the plates, and the cells were incubated for 12-16 h before being used for experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation—Lysates (∼300 μg of proteins) were pre-cleared with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (50% slurry), and then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with fresh protein G-beads (35 μl) and 1 μg of monoclonal anti-FLAG or anti-p63 antibodies. The beads were loaded in SDS loading buffer directly onto an SDS-acrylamide gel after vigorously washing twice with lysis buffer, twice with SNNTE, and once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by WB using monoclonal anti-p63 or monoclonal anti-p300 antibodies, and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For the co-immunoprecipitation assays with p63γ and p300 these buffers were used without the addition of EDTA. GST Fusion Protein Association Assay—The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 12B column. Protein-protein association assays were conducted as reported using fusion protein-containing beads (27Zeng X. Li X. Miller A. Yuan Z. Yuan W. Kwok R.P. Goodman R. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1299-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Purified His-p63γ protein was incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50% slurry) containing approximately equal amounts of GST-p300-19-596, 596-963, 963-1302, 1302-1756, 1710-1916, 1916-2414, or GST-0. Thirty minutes after incubation shaking at room temperature, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, once in SNNTE, and once in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed on a 10% SDS gel and detected by WB using the anti-p63 monoclonal antibody to detect p63-GST-p300 interactions. His Fusion Protein Association Assay—His-p63γ wild type and deletion mutants His-p63γ-F1-4 (F1, amino acids 1-131; F2, amino acids 131-358; F3, amino acids 359-448; F4, amino acids 390-448) were subcloned into the pET-30a vector and expressed and purified from bacteria using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads as described previously (42Keller D.M.

The primers used to subclone F1-F4 from pEGFP-63γ were: F1, 5′-CGGGATCCATGTCCCAGAGCACACAGAC-3′, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGGTGTTGGAGGGGATGGCGG-3′, F2, 5′-CGGGATCCGACTACCCAGGCCCGCACAG-3′, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATCTGGGGATCTTCGTTTCTTG-3′, F3, 5′-CGGGATCCGATGAACTGTTATACTTACC-3′, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGGGTACACTGATCGGTTTGG-3′, F4, 5′-CGGGATCCCAGCACACAATTGAAACGTAC-3′, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGGGTACACTGATCGGTTTGG-3′. Purified Flag-p300 protein was incubated with the nickel beads (50% slurry) containing approximately equal amounts of His-p63γ wild type, p63γ F1, F2, F3, F4, or nickel beads alone. Thirty minutes after incubation shaking at room temperature, the beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, once in SNNTE, and once in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed on a 10% SDS gel and detected by WB using the anti-p300 monoclonal antibody to detect p300-His-p63γ interactions. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from H1299 p300 siRNA cells transfected with pEGFP-Cl-p63γ, or empty vector alone using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcriptions were performed by incubating 1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl RT reaction mixture containing 10 mmol/liter deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer at 65 °C for 5 min. 26 units of RNase inhibitor, 200 units of SuperScript reverse transcriptase, in 1× first-strand buffer and 0.01 m dithiothreitol (Invitrogen) were added to the mix and incubated at 42 °C for 50 min, inactivated at 70 °C for 10 min, and chilled to 4 °C. After cDNA synthesis, 2 μl of the cDNA solution was used for PCR in a 20-μl mixture containing 1 × PCR buffer, 60 μmol/liter of dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics), 0.5 μmol/liter of each primer. PCR were conducted at 94 °C for 30 s, at 55 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 1 min for 25 cycles. In the case of the titration of the template used for PCR to ensure linear amplification (see Fig. 5A) 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μl of template was used in the PCR. PCR products were resolved onto a 1% agarose gel. The following primers were used: p21: 5′-ATGTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGATG-3′, 5′-TTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAG-3′; β-actin: 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′, 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′; p63: 5′-CGGGATCCGATGAACTGTTATACTTACC-3′, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTGGGTACACTGATCGGTTTGG-3′. Cell Cycle Analysis—H1299 cells were infected with virus expressing GFP-ΔN-p63γ alone or together with Flag-p300 and GFP-p63γ alone or together with Flag-p300 and Flag-p300AT2. Twenty-five hours postinfection and 16 h after nocodazole treatment (150 ng/ml), cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to a polystyrene tube. Cells were fixed in 500 μl of paraformaldehyde (2% in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were spun down, and the pellets washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. Then, 500 μl of pH 7.2 propidium iodide stain (0.1 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.2 mg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100) was added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed for DNA content using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. The data were analyzed by the multicycle software program using the polynomial S-phase algorithm. p300 Acetylates p63γ in Vitro—p300 is known to be important for mediating the transcriptional activity of p53 and p73 (32Gu W.

To elucidate whether this is also true of the third family member p63, we conducted in vitro acetylation assays using recombinant p300 and PCAF purified from baculovirus and His-p63γ wild type and mutants purified from bacteria. Acetylated proteins were detected by anti-acetylated lysine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, p63γ, like p53, is acetylated in the presence of either PCAF (lane 5) or p300 (lane 6). To further confirm this result, we also conducted the same in vitro acetylation assay using 3H-labeled acetyl CoA instead of non-labeled acetyl CoA as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1B, again both p53 and p63γ were acetylated by either p300 or PCAF. In both cases, p300 was much more effective than PCAF in acetylating p63γ (compare lane 5 with lane 6), probably because of the fact that p300 targets more lysine residues than PCAF (17van Bokhoven H.

https://openalex.org/W2123210495,"The mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 resistance to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) involves reverse transcriptase (RT)-catalyzed phosphorolytic excision of the chain-terminating AZT-5′-monophosphate (AZTMP). Primers terminated with AZTMP are generally better substrates for this reaction than those terminated with 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside-5′-monophosphate (2′,3′-ddNMP) analogs that lack a 3′-azido moiety. This led to the hypothesis that the 3′-azido group is a major structural determinant for maintaining the primer terminus in the appropriate site for phosphorolytic excision of AZTMP by AZT-resistant (AZTR) RT. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the incorporation, phosphorolytic excision, and antiviral activity of a panel of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN including 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddA (AZddA), 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddC (AZddC), 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddG (AZddG), AZT, and 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddU (AZddU). The results indicate that mutations correlated with resistance to AZT (D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q) confer resistance to the 3′-azidopyrimidine nucleosides (AZddC, AZT, and AZddU) but not to the 3′-azidopurine nucleosides (AZddA and AZddG). The data suggest that the presence of a 3′-azido group on the 3′-terminal nucleotide of the primer does not confer increased phosphorolytic excision by AZTR RT for all 3′-azido-ddNMP analogs. Thus, the 3′-azido group cannot be the only structural determinant important for the enhanced phosphorolytic excision of AZTMP associated with HIV resistance to AZT. Other structural components, such as the base, must play a role in defining the specificity of the excision phenotype arising from AZT resistance mutations.

RT synthesizes the double-stranded proviral DNA precursor from the viral (+) RNA genome (1Lightfoote M.M. Coligan J.E. Folks T.M. Fauci A.S. Martin M.A. Venkatesan S. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 771-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its essential role in HIV-1 replication, RT is a major target for antiretroviral drug development and two structurally dissimilar classes of RT inhibitors, termed nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTI) and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors, are routinely used for the clinical treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals (2Parniak M.A. Sluis-Cremer N. Adv. Pharmacol. 2000; 49: 67-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). NRTI are 2′-deoxyribonucleoside analogs that usually lack a 3′-OH group on the ribose moiety. After intracellular conversion to the active 5′-triphosphate form, NRTI-TP inhibit DNA synthesis by competing with the natural nucleotides both for recognition by RT as a substrate and by incorporation into the nascent viral DNA chain (3Goody R.S. Műller B. Restle T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Incorporation of an NRTI into the nascent viral DNA chain by RT results in termination of DNA synthesis. As is the case with all antiretroviral agents, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants limits the efficacy of NRTI. Most NRTI-resistant viruses isolated from patients treated with nucleoside analogs have mutations in the pol gene (4Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.M. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar). To date, two major phenotypic mechanisms have been proposed to account for HIV-1 resistance to NRTIs (5Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1408-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Selmi B. Deval J. Boretto J. Canard B. Antiviral Ther. 2003; 8: 143-154PubMed Google Scholar). One mechanism is NRTI discrimination in which the mutant RT can preferentially incorporate the natural dNTP over the NRTI-TP analog. The second mechanism involves pyrophosphate- or ATP-dependent phosphorolytic excision of the chain-terminating NRTI from the 3′-end of the primer by HIV-1 RT (7Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 8Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). This excision phenotype has primarily been associated with AZT resistance. In this regard, HIV-1 RT having various combinations of AZT resistance mutations (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215(F/Y), and K219Q) shows a significantly enhanced rate of excision of AZT-5′-monophosphate (AZTMP) compared with the wild-type (WT) enzyme (7Arion D.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For HIV-1 RT to effectively excise AZT from the 3′-end of a primer, the chain-terminating AZTMP must reside in the nucleotide-binding site (N-site) of the active site of the enzyme (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Sarafianos S.G. Clark A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the binding of the next correct dNTP can drive the terminating nucleotide into the primer-binding site (P-site) resulting in the formation of a dead-end complex (8Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol.

Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Formation of this complex prevents the excision reaction from occurring. Several studies have shown that the excision of AZTMP by AZT-resistant (AZTR)RT is much less sensitive (>50-fold) to inhibition by the next correct dNTP than other NRTI analogs that lack a 3′-azido group (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 12Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob.

These data suggest that the 3′-azido group might interfere either with the ability of the primer 3′-terminal AZTMP to translocate from the N- to P-site, or with the ability of the AZTMP moiety to occupy the P-site. It has thus been proposed that the 3′-azido group of the AZTMP-terminated primer is the primary structural determinant of AZT responsible for the excision phenotype of AZTR RT or HIV-1 (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Sarafianos S.G. Clark A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To evaluate this model, we examined the incorporation, phosphorolytic excision, and antiviral activity of a panel of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN compounds including 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddA (AZddA), 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddC (AZddC), 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddG (AZddG), 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddU (AZddU), and AZT. Our results indicate that AZT resistance mutations do not confer significant cross-resistance of HIV-1 to 3′-azidopurine nucleosides (AZddA and AZddG). Furthermore, a 3′-azido group on a 3′-terminal purine nucleotide does not enhance phosphorolytic excision by AZTR RT, suggesting that other structural factors must play a role in defining the specificity of the excision phenotype arising from AZT resistance mutations. Reagents—WT RT and AZTR HIV-1 RT with mutations D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity as previously described (15Fletcher R.S. Holleschak G. Nagy E. Arion D. Borkow G. Gu Z. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 7: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the purified enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction co-efficient (ϵ280) of 260,450 m-1 cm-1. The active site concentrations of RT were calculated from pre-steady-state burst experiments (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Burst amplitudes of 59 and 52% were calculated for the WT and AZTR RT enzymes, respectively. All experiments described below were performed using corrected RT active site concentrations. The triphosphate forms of all 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies (San Diego, CA). The 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN were also purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies, except for 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddC, which was synthesized as previously described (17Lin T.-S. Guo J.-Y. Schinazi R.F. Chu C.K. Xiang J.-N. Prusoff W.H. J. Med. Chem. 1988; 31: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ATP was from Roche Diagnostics. DNA Substrates—DNA oligomers were obtained from Invitrogen. A 20-nucleotide (nt) DNA primer (5′-TCGGGCGCCACTGCTAGAGA-3′) and a 57-nt DNA template (5′-CTCAGACCCTTTTAGTCAGAATGGAAANTCTCTAGCAGTGGCGCCCGAACAGGGACA-3′) were used in all experiments. Four DNA templates were synthesized, each of which contained a different nucleotide at position 30 (indicated by N in the 57-nt DNA template sequence). This strategy allowed us to evaluate the kinetics of single nucleotide incorporation or excision for all 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP in essentially the same sequence context and using the same 20-nt primer. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Experiments and Product Analysis—The 20-nt DNA primer was 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions. The labeled primer was then resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 7 m urea, 16% polyacrylamide gels, followed by elution of the 21-nt primer from the gel. The 5′-32P-labeled primer was then annealed to the 57-nt DNA template (1.5:1 molar ratio of primer:template) by heating to 90 °C, followed by slow cooling to ambient temperature. A rapid quench instrument (Bio-Logic SFM-400, Claix, France) was used for pre-steady-state kinetic experiments with reaction times ranging from 10 ms to 7 s. A typical experiment was performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and varying concentrations of nucleotide (dNTP). HIV-1 RT was preincubated with the DNA substrate prior to rapid mixing with dNTP and divalent metal ions to begin the reaction. The final concentrations in the reaction mixture were 100 nm RT active sites and 25 nm of the template/primer (T/P). After varying times the reactions were quenched with 0.5 m EDTA. Quenched samples were mixed with an equal volume of gel loading buffer (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol), denatured by heating at 85 °C for 5 min, followed by electrophoretic resolution of the product on a 7 m urea, 16% polyacrylamide gel. The disappearance of the 20-nt substrate primer and the formation of the 21-nt product were analyzed using a Bio-Rad GS525 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Data Analysis—Kinetic data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Sigma Plot software (Jandel Scientific) with the appropriate equations as described below. The apparent burst rate constant (kobs) for each particular concentration of dNTP was determined by fitting the time courses for the formation of the 21-nt product with the equation, [21−nt product]=A[1−exp(−kobst)](Eq. 1) where A represents the burst amplitude. The turnover number (kpol) and apparent dissociation constant for dNTP (Kd) were then obtained by plotting the apparent catalytic rates, kobs, against dNTP concentrations and fitting the data to the hyperbolic Equation 2, kobs=(kpol[dNTP])/([dNTP]+Kd)(Eq. 2) Assay of RT-catalyzed Phosphorolysis—The 20-nt DNA primer was 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to one of the four DNA templates described above. 3′-Azido-NRTI was added to the primer 3′ terminus by incubation with WT RT and 100 μm of the appropriate 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP for 30 min at 37 °C. The 32P-labeled chain-terminated 21-nt primer was purified by elution of the appropriate band following resolution by 7 m urea, 16% acrylamide denaturing gel electrophoresis. The purified chain-terminated primer was then annealed to the appropriate DNA primer for use in phosphorolysis experiments. The phosphorolytic removal of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMP was assayed by incubating WT or AZTR RT with the chain-terminated T/P of interest (4:1 ratio of RT:T/P) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 3.0 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (0.01 unit; Sigma) was included. Aliquots were removed at the defined times and quenched with equal volumes of gel loading dye (98% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). The 21-nt substrate and 20-nt products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and the reduction in substrate and formation of product were analyzed by phosphorimaging. Data were fit to the following single-exponential equation to determine the apparent rate of ATP-mediated excision, [20−nt product]=A[exp(−kexcisiont)](Eq. 3) where A represents the amplitude for product formation. Electrophoretic Analysis of RT Polymerization Products Formed under Continuous DNA Polymerization Conditions—A heteropolymeric RNA-dependent DNA polymerase T/P was prepared as described previously (18Arts E.J. Li X. Gu Z. Kleiman L. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14672-14680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the T7 polymerase RNA transcript from AccI-linearized plasmid pHIV-PBS as template and the synthetic 20-nt DNA oligonucleotide primer described above. DNA polymerization reactions were carried out by incubating 200 nm (active site) WT and AZTR RT with 50 nm heteropolymeric T/P in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl for 5 min prior to the addition of 5 μm of each dNTP, 1 μm of the desired 3′-azido-2′,3′ddNTP, 3.0 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 unit of inorganic pyrophosphatase. After defined incubation periods, aliquots were removed from the reaction tube and quenched with equal volumes of gel loading dye. Products were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and quantified by phosphorimaging. Cells, Viruses, and Antiviral Susceptibility Assays—MT-2 cells (obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES buffer, 50 IU of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. WT and AZTR virus stocks, generated from plasmid DNA encoding an infectious proviral clone of HIV-1LAI (19Nguyen M.H. Schinazi R.S. Shi C. Goudgaon N.M. McKenna P.M. Mellors J.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2409-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Peden L. Emerman M. Montagnier L. Virology. 1991; 185: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), were prepared in MT-2 cells and subjected to titer determination as previously described (21Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-496Google Scholar). Antiviral activity was determined by inoculating MT-2 cells with WT or AZTR virus stocks (multiplicity of infection, 0.01 50% tissue culture infective dose/cell) followed by incubation in the presence of 2- or 3-fold serial dilutions of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN. The amount of HIV-1 p24 antigen released into the culture supernatant was determined 7 days post-infection and used to determine the concentration of each compound required to reduce p24 antigen production by 50% (IC50). Pre-steady-state Incorporation of 3′-Azido-2′,3′-ddNTPs by WT and AZTR HIV-1 RT—Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP incorporation by WT and AZTR HIV-1 RT were undertaken to elucidate the detailed interactions of these nucleotide analogs with the RT polymerase active site. Fig. 1 illustrates the results of a typical experiment. These experiments were used to define the maximum rate of incorporation (kpol), dissociation constant (Kd), and catalytic efficiency of incorporation (kpol/Kd) for each nucleotide analog for both the WT and AZTR enzymes (Table I). Both WT and AZTR RT could readily incorporate all the 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP. The relative catalytic efficiencies of incorporation (kpol/Kd) were AZdATP > AZTTP ≅ AZddUTP > AZddCTP > AZddGTP.

The relative rates of ATP-mediated phosphorolysis by WT and AZTR RT (in the absence of dNTP) were AZddAMP > AZddUMP > AZTMP > AZddCMP > AZddGMP. In contrast to the incorporation data, there were significant differences in the rates of ATP-mediated phosphorolytic excision of the various 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMP by WT and AZTR RT.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the relative insensitivity of AZTMP excision to inhibition by the next nucleotide compared with other NRTI-MP may account for the greater degree of resistance to AZT conferred by TAMs than to other NRTI (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 12Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of AZT resistance mutations on the magnitude and nature of inhibition by the next complementary nucleotide during the phosphorolytic removal of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMP analogs, 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the next complementary nucleotide for the ATP-dependent removal of the primer 3′-terminal NRTI-MP were determined for each of the 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMP analogs (Table II). For both the WT and AZTR enzymes, the inhibitory concentrations of the next complementary dNTP were substantially higher than putative intracellular dNTP concentrations. IC50 values for the AZTR enzyme were ∼3-fold higher than for the WT enzyme. Comparison of the Incorporation and Excision Efficiencies of 3′-Azido-2′,3′-ddNTP by WT and AZTR RT—During HIV-1 replication there are multiple opportunities for RT to incorporate and excise NRTI-MP. The capacity for WT or mutant RT to excise any given NRTI is therefore best considered as the ratio of the efficiency of RT-catalyzed NRTI excision to the catalytic efficiency of RT-catalyzed NRTI incorporation. In this context, analysis of the data from Tables I and II shows that AZTR RT exhibits a preference to incorporate and then excise AZddUTP > AZTTP > AZddCTP > AZddATP > AZddGTP (Fig. 2). Of note, AZTR RT showed no increased ability to excise AZddGMP compared with the WT enzyme. It should be noted that the catalytic efficiency of ATP-mediated 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMP excision was calculated by dividing the observed kexcision (Table II) by the concentration of ATP used in the assay (3000 μm), rather than the KD for ATP. We used this approach because difficulty in obtaining saturating ATP concentrations in these assays precludes accurate estimation of the KD for ATP. However, we feel our approach provides a reasonable comparative estimation of the catalytic efficiency of nucleotide excision because previous studies have suggested that there is no significant difference in the affinity for binding of ATP by WT and AZTR reverse transcriptase (25Ray A.S. Murakami E. Basavapathruni A. Vaccara J.A. Ulrich D. Chu C.K. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 29: 8831-8841Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the differences in incorporation and excision of the various 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP, we analyzed steady-state DNA synthesis by both WT and AZTR RT in the presence of each of the 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP and 3 mm ATP, using a heteropolymeric RNA template corresponding to the HIV-1 sequence used for (-) strong stop DNA synthesis, primed with a DNA oligonucleotide (7Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The 173-nt incorporation events needed to produce the full-length DNA product in this assay system allow multiple 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP incorporation and excision events during the formation of the full-length final product. Fig. 3 shows that in the presence of 3 mm ATP, AZTR RT synthesized significantly greater amounts of full-length DNA than WT RT in reactions containing AZTTP (Fig. 3E) or AZddUTP (Fig. 3F), and lesser but still significant amounts of full-length DNA in reactions containing AZddCTP (Fig. 3D). Similarly, much greater levels of small termination products were noted in reactions catalyzed by WT RT in the presence of the 3′-azidopyrimidine compounds compared with AZTR RT. In contrast, there were essentially no differences in either the amount of full-length final product or premature termination products produced by WT and AZTR RT in the presence of AZddATP (Fig. 3B) or AZddGTP (Fig. 3C). Antiviral Activity of 3′-Azido-2′,3′-ddN—WT or AZTR virus (encoding the mutations D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q in RT) were tested for susceptibility to inhibition by 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN in virus spread assays in lymphocytoid MT2 cells. The antiviral activity of the various 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN was consistent with the enzyme studies, in that AZTR virus showed demonstrable resistance to the 3′-azidopyrimidine nucleosides AZT and AZddC, but not to the 3′-azidopurine nucleosides AZddA or AZddG (Table III). In our experiments, AZddU did not exhibit antiviral activity in the MT2 cell line at concentrations up to 200 μm. Previous studies have shown that AzddU is not phosphorylated in certain cells, and hence is not effective against HIV in these cell systems (26Williams G.J. Colby C.B. Schinazi R.F. Sommadossi J.P.

TAMs in RT do not enable discrimination between the natural dNTP substrate and the analogous NRTI-TP during mutant RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis (22Krebs R. Immendörfer U. Thrall S.H. Wöhrl B.M.

Instead, TAMs increase the ability of RT to remove or excise the incorporated NRTI by a phosphorolytic enzymatic reaction (7Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G.

The 3′-terminal nucleotide of the growing viral DNA strand resides in two different positions in the polymerase active site of the RT-nucleic acid complex during polymerization (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Sarafianos S.G. Clark A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R.

Nucleosides Nucleotides. 2001; 20: 1025-1028Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The N-site, or the nucleotide site, is that where the primer 3′-terminal nucleotide is located immediately after addition of a dNTP or NRTI-TP. The P-site is that in which the primer 3′ terminus is moved by a single register from the N-site. This translocation event positions the next template base to allow hydrogen bond stabilization with the base of the incoming cognate dNTP, thereby facilitating formation of the appropriate ternary complex for additional dNTP incorporation. RT-catalyzed phosphorolytic excision of an NRTI-MP from the primer 3′ terminus requires that the terminal NRTI reside in the N-site (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Sarafianos S.G. Clark A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Binding of the next complementary dNTP seems to promote translocation of the primer 3′ terminus into the P-site (34Rothwell P.J. Berger S. Kensch O. Felekyan S. Antonik M. Wohrl B.M. Restle T. Goody R.S. Seidel C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1655-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). If the 3′-terminal nucleotide is an NRTI, this translocation effectively forms a “dead-end complex” in which phosphorolytic excision cannot occur (8Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 9Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), because phosphodiester bond formation is precluded. Excision of AZTMP by HIV-1 AZTR RT is much less sensitive to inhibition by the next complementary dNTP than is that of other NRTI that lack a 3′-azido group (9Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This observation has led to the hypothesis that the 3′-azido group is an important, perhaps the major, determinant for enabling the phosphorolytic excision process (10Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4832-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 11Sarafianos S.G. Clark A.D. Das K. Tuske S. Birktoft J.J. Ilankumaran P. Ramesha A.R. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6614-6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Our results, however, do not support this hypothesis. WT and AZTR RT showed virtually identical catalytic efficiencies for the incorporation of all the 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTPs tested (Table I). In contrast, AZTR RT was more efficient than WT RT for ATP-dependent phosphorolytic removal of incorporated 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMPs, in particular AZTMP and AZddUMP. The differences between 3′-azidopyrimidine and 3′-azidopurine NRTI were further magnified in the steady-state DNA synthesis that enabled multiple events of 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNTP incorporation and 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddNMP excision (Fig. 3). Differences in the full-length DNA product synthesized by WT and AZTR RT were only noted in reactions containing pyrimidine compounds AZTTP, 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddUTP, and 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddCTP (Fig. 2). The inability of AZTR RT to efficiently excise 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddAMP and 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddGMP in the steady-state DNA synthesis experiments was not a result of these analogs being more sensitive to dead-end complex formation by the next complementary nucleotide. AZTR RT showed ∼3-5-fold increases in IC50 relative to WT RT for inhibition of all of the 3′-azido-dNMPs evaluated (Table II). In all cases, the levels of the next complementary dNTP needed to inhibit AZTR RT-mediated excision were much greater than putative intracellular dNTP concentrations (35Trout T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). HIV-1 susceptibility to the 3′-azido-2′,3′-ddN (Table III) was consistent with biochemical data. AZTR virus exhibited at least 10-fold resistance to AZT and AZddC. AZddU was inactive in the MT2 cell line used in these studies, possibly because of inadequate intracellular conversion to the triphosphate (25Ray A.S. Murakami E. Basavapathruni A. Vaccara J.A. Ulrich D. Chu C.K. Schinazi R.F. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 29: 8831-8841Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AZTR HIV showed no cross-resistance to either AzddA or AZddG. This result suggests that 3′-azidopurine nucleoside analogs that exhibit good antiviral activity and cytotoxicity profiles may be useful for the treatment of AZT-resistant HIV. Our data clearly show that the nucleotide base component, not just the sugar 3′-azido moiety, is important for the excision phenotype. In this regard, TAMs in RT enable the enzyme to efficiently excise chain-terminating 3′-azidopyrimidines, but are less effective for excision of 3′-azidopurines. These data suggest that careful consideration be given to the choice of NRTI in experiments characterizing the phosphorolysis phenotype conferred by specific combinations of TAMs."

Inhibition of PP2A using the pharmacologic inhibitor okadaic acid at 250 nm for 16 h resulted in a 60% reduction in PP2A activity in MCF-7 cells concurrent with a 75% reduction in ER mRNA and protein expression. Similar results were obtained with a small interfering RNA probe that specifically inhibited PP2A expression. ER promoter studies showed that regulation of ER through the PP2A pathway did not occur through transcriptional activation. Rather, PP2A mediated ER expression through modulation of ER mRNA stability through degradation of ER mRNA, reversible with concomitant treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG 132.

PP2A is a holoenzyme comprised of three subunits, a structural subunit (A), a regulatory subunit (B), and a catalytic subunit (C). A and C subunits are highly conserved, each consisting of two highly homologous isoforms, α and β, whereas the B subunit is much more complex, containing three distinct families, B, B′, and B″, each with several homologous members (3Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). Considering all the potential interactions between the multitudes of subunits, 75 different combinations of A-B-C subunits could form, providing the potential for immense diversity and target specificity within the cell. Dysregulation of PP2A has been shown to be a contributing factor in many cancer types. Mutations in the A subunit, resulting in decreased interaction with the B and C subunits and improper formation of the holoenzyme, have been noted in a subset of colorectal and breast cancers (15Tamaki M. Goi T. Hirono Y. Katayama K. Yamaguchi A. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 3: 655-659Google Scholar, 16Ruediger R. Pham H. Walter G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of PP2A alone resulted in cellular transformation in human embryonic kidney cells (17Chen W. Possemato R. Campbell K. Plattner C. Pallas D.C. Hahn W. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Aberrant subcellular localization of PP2A has been shown to alter cellular growth and apoptosis in hepatic cancer cells (18Wang G.-L. Iakova P. Wilde M. Awad S. Timchenko N.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that changes in PP2A can contribute directly to cancer development, increased cellular growth, and decreased apoptosis (17Chen W. Possemato R. Campbell K. Plattner C. Pallas D.C. Hahn W. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 18Wang G.-L. Iakova P. Wilde M. Awad S. Timchenko N.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Decreased nuclear localization of PP2A is correlated with decreased PP2A activity in estrogen receptor α (ER)-negative compared with ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines, suggesting that PP2A could be a contributing factor to the hormone-independent phenotype that comprises a large subset of all human breast cancer cases (19Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Fontana J.A. Clarke R. Cancer Lett. 1999; 136: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mechanism of PP2A-mediated ER expression is still largely unknown. Approximately 70–80% of all breast tumors express ER protein. These tumors tend to grow more slowly and are associated with a slightly better prognosis (20Osborne C.K. Yochmowitz M.G. Knight III, W.A. McGuire W.L. Cancer. 1980; 46: 2884-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). More importantly, the detection of ER in breast carcinoma cells is an important indicator of potential response to endocrine therapy as tumors expressing ER protein are the most likely to respond to endocrine therapy, whereas those lacking ER seldom respond (21Keen J.C. Davidson N.E. Cancer. 2003; 97: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms controlling these effects are still being defined. Determining the molecular mechanisms underlying ER expression, therefore, is crucial to the understanding and treatment of breast cancer. ER expression is controlled at the transcriptional level through both epigenetic mechanisms and activation of the proximal (P1) ER promoter (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23deGraffenried L. Hopp T. Valente A. Clark R. Fuqua S.A. Breast Cancer Res.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6890-6894PubMed Google Scholar). ER expression is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level through modulation of mRNA stability via interactions with the 3′-UTR (26Martin M.B. Saceda M. Lindsey R.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 330: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 27Kenealy M.R. Flouriot G. Pope C. Gannon F. Biochem. Soc.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2805-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previous data from our laboratory suggest that the Bβ subunit of PP2A is re-expressed coordinately with ER when ER-negative cells are treated with epigenetic modulators (29Keen J.C. Garrett-Mayer E. Pettit C. Mack K. Manning J. Herman J.G. Davidson N.E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PP2A expression is upstream of ER expression and may play an important role in the transcriptional control of ER (29Keen J.C. Garrett-Mayer E. Pettit C. Mack K. Manning J. Herman J.G. Davidson N.E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Maintenance, and Treatment—MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, T47D, and MCF-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 2 μm l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). For MDA-MB-231 ER+ (231ER+) cells, the entire coding region of ER was PCR amplified using MCF-7 cDNA as template and cloned into the expression vector pIRESHyg2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The cloned cDNA was sequenced to verify the ER cDNA sequence. The construct was then transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Stable colonies were selected using Hygromycin B (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) at a concentration of 800 μg/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium. Stable clones (termed 231ER+) were maintained in selection medium to ensure high levels of ER expression. Unless otherwise indicated, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were plated at 300,000 cells/10-cm plate and 500,000 cells/10-cm plate, respectively, 24 h before treatment with okadaic acid (250 nm, OA) (Calbiochem) for 16 h. Reverse Transcription, PCR, and Real-time PCR—RNA was harvested using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as previously described (30Ferguson A.T. Lapidus R. Baylin S. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2279-2283PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h. Conventional PCR was performed in cDNA samples as previously described (30Ferguson A.T. Lapidus R. Baylin S. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2279-2283PubMed Google Scholar) using the following primers: ERα S, GCA CCC TGA AGT CTC TGG AA; AS, TGG CTA AAG TGG TGC ATG AT (55 °C, 35 cycles); PP2A S, TAT CTC TAC GGT AGA ATT CAA CCA CAC GGG; AS, CTT ATC ACG CTC GCT CGC TGA CTT (60 °C, 35 cycles); Actin S, ACC ATG GAT GAT GAT ATC GC; AS, ACA TGG CTG GGG TGT TGA AG (60 °C, 30 cycles). Expression of ER and PP2A was also quantified using real-time PCR. cDNA was amplified using SYBR green (Sigma) for ER, PP2A, and GAPDH at an annealing temperature of 60 °C with 1-min annealing time for 40 cycles using the following primers: ER 5′-CTC TCC CAC ATC AGG CAC, A 3′-CTT TGG TCC GTC TCC TCC A; PP2A 5′-TAT CTC TAC GGT AGA ATT CAA CCA CAC GGG, 3′CTT ATC ACG CTC GCT CGC TGA CT; GAPDH 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C, 3′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC. Real-time PCR data were acquired and analyzed using Sequence Detector v1.7 software (PerkinElmer) and normalized using GAPDH housekeeping gene detection. PP2A Activity Assay—PP2A activity in whole cell MCF-7 lysates was determined by the PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, PP2Ac subunit was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of nuclear extracts using 2 μg of anti-PP2Ac antibody (Upstate clone 1D6) for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were extensively washed in Tris-buffered saline and Ser-Thr phosphatase assay buffer. Phosphatase activity was determined by measuring conversion of phosphate, nPPNP, added directly to the beads for 15 min at 37 °C. Accumulation of dephosphorylated substrate was measured in the supernatant using a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 405-nm wavelength. Western Blotting—MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-231 +ER cells were treated with 250 nm OA for 16 h. Protein was harvested from cells using whole cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 μm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) on ice for 30 min. Equal concentrations of whole cell lysates were denatured in 2× Laemmeli's sample buffer and separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels (GeneMate; ISC Biotechnology, Kaysville, UT). Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 volts for 1.5–2 h. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then hybridized with primary antibody (ER, Hc20, Santa Cruz, 1:500; PP2AA, H300, Santa Cruz, 1:500; PP2AB, 05 592, Upstate, 1:1000; PP2AB′ 07 334, Upstate, 1:1000; PP2AC 1D6, Upstate, 1:1000; Actin, Sigma, 1:10,000) overnight at 4 °C while gently rocking before incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (DAKO, 1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). RNA Interference—MCF-7 cells were seeded at 70,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were then transiently transfected with specific PP2Ac subunit and non-targeting DNA control probes (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, Oligofectamine reagent (200 nm) was incubated with Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) for 5 min at room temperature. Specific PP2A-c siRNA probes (5 nm) or nontargeting DNA probes (5 nm) (Dharmacon) were added to the Oligofectamine mixture and incubated at room temperature for 10 min for proper transfection complex formation. Transfection mixtures were then added to cells in serum-free medium. After 4 h, serum concentrations in each well were adjusted to 5%, and cells were harvested after 72 h for RNA and protein. Promoter Deletion and Luciferase Assay—MCF-7 cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. 3 μl of Gene Jammer (Invitrogen) transfection reagent was used to transiently transfect 0.5 μg of pERP pGL3 basic luciferase ER promoter deletion constructs (–2769, –1000, –745, or –245 to +212) (kindly provided by Dr. Suzanne Fuqua, Baylor College of Medicine). 1 μgof β-galactosidase expression vector was cotransfected with all plasmids to determine transfection efficiency. At 48 h, luciferase activity was measured on a Monolight luminometer using the BrightGlo luciferase assay kit (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was determined using the β-galactosidase activity kit (Promega). Experiments were completed three times, and each measurement was taken in duplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were harvested from MCF-7 cells with or without okadaic acid treatment for 16 h at 250 nm as previously described (31Keen J.C. Sholl L. Wills-Karp M. Georas S.N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein extracts (4 μg/lane) were incubated with 8% glycerol and either poly(dI-dC) or poly(dG-dC) (0.2 μg) (Pharmacia) as indicated for 20 min on ice. γ-32P-labeled probes (3 × 104 counts/min/lane) corresponding to the –245 region of the ER promoter element were then added to cell extracts and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The oligonucleotide used, 5′-ACCTTAGCAGATCCTCGT-3′ (–245 to –225) included the SP1 binding site identified by deGraffenried et al. (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Extracts were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis run at 150 V in 0.5× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA), followed by autoradiography. Actinomycin D Assays—MCF-7 cells were seeded at 800,000 cells/10-cm plate for 24 h prior to treatment with or without okadaic acid (250 nm) and actinomycin D (4 μg/ml; Sigma). RNA was isolated after 0, 2, and 8 h of treatment, and gene expression changes were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR. Transient Transfection Assays—To construct the ER 3′-UTR expression plasmid, the 3′-UTR region of the ER (3.7 kb) and the ER coding sequence were PCR amplified using RPCI-1 human clone (130E4; Invitrogen). The amplified cDNA fragments and ER coding region were cloned in the NotI/XhoI sites of pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced to verify accuracy. The ER 3′-UTR and coding region cDNAs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pIREShyg2 (Clontech). The ER 3′-UTR and coding region construct was transiently transfected with Lipofectamine into MDA-MB-231 cells according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following transfection, cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. Cells were then treated for 4 h with OA (250 nm), the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 μm; Sigma), or a combination. Actinomycin D (4 μg/ml) was subsequently added to block mRNA synthesis. Expression of ER mRNA was measured by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression. Experiments were performed twice, with each measurement taken in duplicate. PP2A Subunits Are Abundantly Expressed in Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines and Are Inhibited by Okadaic Acid Treatment—Western blotting of whole cell lysates from MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cells showed that PP2A A, B, B′, and C subunits are abundantly expressed in several human breast cancer cells of variable phenotype (Fig. 1). OA is a widely used PP2A inhibitor, known to inhibit PP2A activity at nm concentrations through blockade of the catalytic subunit (PP2Ac). In MCF-7 cells, OA treatment had no effect on PP2A mRNA expression as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 2A) but significantly decreased PP2A activity (Fig. 2B) (p < 0.01).Fig. 2OA treatment of MCF-7 cells results in decreased PP2A activity without alteration in PP2A mRNA expression. MCF-7 cells were treated with or without 250 nm OA for 16 h. A, expression of PP2Ac subunit mRNA following OA treatment was quantitated by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression. B, PP2A activity was measured in MCF-7 whole cell lysates with or without OA treatment. Shown is the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments conducted in duplicate. *, p < 0.01 as determined by Student's t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inhibition of PP2A Decreased ER mRNA, Protein, and Activity—Previous reports from our laboratory (29Keen J.C. Garrett-Mayer E. Pettit C. Mack K. Manning J. Herman J.G. Davidson N.E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and others (19Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Fontana J.A. Clarke R. Cancer Lett. 1999; 136: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have suggested a role for PP2A in the regulation of ER. Therefore, the effect of OA on ER expression was examined in ER-positive MCF-7 cells. OA inhibition of PP2A resulted in an 80% reduction in ER mRNA expression as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 3A) (p < 0.001). This decrease in ER mRNA translated into a significant decrease in ER protein (Fig. 3C). The decrease in ER was functionally significant as demonstrated by decreased mRNA and protein expression of the progesterone receptor (PR), a well recognized ER-responsive gene (Fig. 3, B and C) (p < 0.001). In contrast, OA treatment had no effect on protein expression of another member of the nuclear receptor family, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Fig. 3C), which unlike PR is not regulated by ER activity. Genetic Inhibition of PP2A with Small Interfering RNAs Resulted in a Significant Decrease in ER Expression—Although the pharmacologic inhibitor OA has been shown to be 100–1000-fold more specific for PP2A than for any other protein phosphatase family member, the effects of PP2A inhibition were confirmed using a genetic approach, small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting PP2Ac. Transfection of MCF-7 cells with siRNA against PP2Ac resulted in a significant decrease in PP2A mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 4, A and D) (p < 0.05). This inhibition of PP2A resulted in a significant decrease in ER mRNA and protein (Fig. 4, B and D)(p < 0.05). Inhibition also resulted in a decrease in ER activity as determined by a decrease in mRNA and protein expression of the ER-responsive gene, PR (Fig. 4, C and D) (p < 0.01). As with OA treatment, siRNA inhibition of PP2A had no effect on VDR protein expression, confirming the specificity of the effect of PP2A on the ER pathway (Fig. 4D). PP2A Does Not Alter ER Promoter Activity—ER expression is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. To test whether PP2A exerts its effects on ER promoter activation, the effect of OA treatment on ER transcription was tested using MCF-7 cells transiently transfected with pERP pGL3 basic luciferase promoter constructs (Fig. 5A) (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). deGraffenried et al. (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have reported that the ER promoter region is constitutively active in MCF-7 cells and that the most proximal 245 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site contains a SP1 binding site that is necessary and sufficient for activation of the ER promoter. Analysis of ∼3000 base pairs of the ER promoter (–2700 to +212) in MCF-7 cells showed substantial ER promoter activity that is not altered with OA treatment (Fig. 5B). Although there appears to be a decrease in ER promoter activity with OA treatment of the –1000 construct, neither the full-length promoter –2700 construct nor the proximal –245 region that contains known transcription factor binding sites showed any difference in promoter activation between control and OA-treated MCF-7cells (Fig. 5B). Studies have shown binding of transcription factors, including SP1 and USF-1, to the –245 region of the ER promoter transactivates ER expression (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23deGraffenried L. Hopp T. Valente A. Clark R. Fuqua S.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 85: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Evaluation of transcription factor binding to the –245 construct via electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis did not show changes in transcription factor binding in OA-treated MCF-7 nuclear extracts compared with control, consistent with our findings using the luciferase promoter constructs (Fig. 5C). PP2A Activates ER through Modulation of mRNA Stability— Because OA treatment led to a decrease in ER mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR without a difference in promoter activation or transcription factor binding, the role of the 3′-UTR in the regulation of ER expression was assessed using the 231ER+ cell model. These cells were generated by stable transfection of an expression construct of ER cDNA cloned from MCF-7 cells under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. 231ER+ cells express high levels of functional ER localized in the nucleus (Fig. 6 and data not shown). As the expression construct contains only the coding sequence of ER without the 3′-UTR, any mRNA-stabilizing effects of the 3′-UTR are absent in 231ER+ cells. Surprisingly, treatment of 231ER+ cells with OA resulted in a significant increase in ER protein expression (Fig. 6); similar results were obtained with MCF10A cells that were transfected with the same ER construct (data not shown). This enhanced ER expression stands in marked contrast with the profound decrease in ER expression following OA treatment of the innately ER-positive MCF-7 and T47D cells. To verify that decreases in ER expression detected in MCF-7 cells reflected changes in endogenous expression of ER, a second ER-positive cell line, T47D, was studied after treatment with OA (10 nm). As seen following PP2A inhibition in MCF-7 cells, ER protein expression in T47D cells was significantly inhibited to below the level of detection by Western blotting (Fig. 6). PP2A Stabilizes ER mRNA through the 3′-UTR—Because OA treatment of MCF-7 cells did not alter promoter activity or transcription factor binding (Fig. 5, A and B), the contribution of the 3′-UTR to ER mRNA stabilization was evaluated. MCF-7 and 231ER+ cells were treated with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (4 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of OA (250 nm) for 0, 2, or 8 h. ER mRNA levels were then quantified by real-time PCR. The percent of mRNA remaining after actinomycin D inhibition of transcription was significantly reduced in MCF-7 cells treated with OA and actinomycin D compared with actinomycin D alone. ER mRNA half-life was significantly reduced from 4.5 to ∼1.5 h (Fig. 7A) (p < 0.006). As expected, no change in ER mRNA decay or half-life was detected in 231ER+ cells (that lack the ER 3′-UTR) in the presence or absence of OA (Fig. 7B). We next tested whether inhibition of the proteasome using the specific inhibitor MG132 would block OA-mediated ER mRNA degradation, suggesting that PP2A-mediated control of ER expression occurs through protein interactions with the ER 3′-UTR. MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with the ER 3′-UTR construct containing 3.7 kb of the 3′-UTR and treated for 4 h with OA (250 nm), MG132 (10 μm), or a combination of OA and MG132. Actinomycin D (4 μg/ml) was then added to inhibit further mRNA synthesis. The percent of ER mRNA remaining was measured by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. Inhibition of the proteasomal pathway prevented OA-mediated ER mRNA degradation (Fig. 8). Similar studies using the Hsp70 inhibitor KNK437 (Calbiochem) to ascertain whether the Hsp70 chaperone protein might play a role in OA-mediated ER mRNA degradation showed no effect (data not shown). Together these results indicate that PP2A stabilizes ER mRNA through interactions with the 3′-UTR and provide a link between PP2A activation and proteasomal degradation. ER expression is regulated at multiple levels in human breast cancer cell lines. These include transcription factor-promoter interactions at the transcriptional level, phosphorylation at the post-transcriptional level, and degradation through altered mRNA stability and proteasomal degradation (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23deGraffenried L. Hopp T. Valente A. Clark R. Fuqua S.A. Breast Cancer Res.

ER expression can also be silenced through epigenetic mechanisms in some ER-negative human breast cancer tumors (24Yang X. Phillips D.L. Ferguson A.T. Nelson W.G. Herman J.G. Davidson N.E.

Issa J. Davidson N.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 805-810PubMed Google Scholar). All of these mechanisms appear to be interrelated and tightly control the regulation of ER expression in the cell. MCF-7 cells are the best characterized model of ER-expressing human breast cancer cells. One mechanism controlling ER expression in these cells is through activation of the promoter region and interaction of transcription factors with the proximal promoter (22deGraffenried L. Hilsenbeck S.G. Fuqua S.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 82: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23deGraffenried L. Hopp T. Valente A. Clark R. Fuqua S.A. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2004; 85: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Studies have also shown that ER contains a long 3′-UTR that contains numerous AUUA sequences and binding sites that have been shown to affect mRNA stability and contribute to regulation of ER gene expression in MCF-7 cells (27Kenealy M.R. Flouriot G. Pope C. Gannon F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 107SCrossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Kenealy M.-R. Flouriot G. Sonntag-Buck V. Dandekar T. Brand H. Gannon F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2805-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated PP2A in the regulation of ER expression. Gopalakrishna et al. (19Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Fontana J.A. Clarke R. Cancer Lett. 1999; 136: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) first reported a correlation between PP2A activity and ER expression in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines. Subsequent studies showed that PP2A activation results in inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), resulting in decreased ER phosphorylation and activity without an alteration of ER protein expression (7Avdi N.J.

Our previous data suggest a role for PP2A in mediating ER expression (29Keen J.C. Garrett-Mayer E. Pettit C. Mack K. Manning J. Herman J.G. Davidson N.E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In a microarray analysis of ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells treated with epigenetic modulators that induce ER expression, up-regulation of PP2A expression was detected in conjunction with ER, suggesting that increased PP2A expression may play a role in the regulation of ER expression (29Keen J.C. Garrett-Mayer E. Pettit C. Mack K. Manning J. Herman J.G. Davidson N.E. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we sought to further characterize the role of PP2A in ER expression in MCF-7 cells. Inhibition of PP2A activity, either through pharmacologic inhibition with OA or by genetic knockdown by siRNA, resulted in a significant decrease in ER mRNA and protein expression (Figs. 3 and 4) and diminished ER activity as determined by down-regulation of an ER-responsive gene, PR. This PP2A-mediated gene expression control is specific for the ER pathway in that no change in expression of another member of the nuclear steroid receptor family, VDR, was detected using either method (Figs. 3C and 4D). Although ER expression is regulated through transcriptional mechanisms, PP2A-mediated ER expression does not involve increased promoter activation or transcription factor interactions (Fig. 5). Transcriptional regulation of ER requires binding of transcription factors including SP1 and USF1 to the proximal promoter region (37Lacroix I. Lipcey C. Imbert J. Kahn-Perles B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9598-9605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PP2A has been shown to physically interact with SP1 in T lymphocytes, suggesting that a potential mechanism of PP2A-mediated ER expression could result from changes in binding of SP1 and activation of ER transcription (38Farhana L. Boyanapalli M. Tschang S.-H. Sun R.-J. Hsu C.K. Zhang Y.-X. Fontana J.A. Rishi A.K. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 541-550PubMed Google Scholar). However, no change in ER promoter activation using luciferase ER promoter constructs or transcription factor binding to the ER P1 promoter was detected, thereby effectively eliminating transcriptional control as a mechanism of PP2A-mediated ER expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Unlike in MCF-7 or T47D cells, OA treatment of 231ER+ cells gave the seemingly paradoxical result of increased ER expression (Fig. 6). Similar findings were seen after OA treatment of MCF10A cells engineered to overexpress ER (data not shown) as well as Rad91 cells overexpressing ER cDNA (36Lu Q. Surks H.K. Ebling H. Baur W.E. Brown D. Pallas D.C. Karas R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4639-4645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The overexpressed ER cDNA in the 231ER+ and MCF10AER+ cells was cloned from MCF-7 cells and shares an identical coding sequence, but it lacks the endogenous ER 3′-UTR that contains numerous binding sites for AUUA- and other RNA-binding proteins. The importance of this region for ER regulation is supported by the actinomycin and proteasome inhibition studies that show a significant decrease in ER mRNA half-life in OA-treated MCF-7 cells compared with untreated MCF-7 cells and no difference in ER mRNA half-life in 231ER+ cells that lack the 3′-UTR (Fig. 7). This OA-mediated ER inhibition was clearly reversed in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 8) but not altered in the presence of the Hsp70 chaperone protein inhibitor KNK437 (data not shown). That this 3′-UTR mechanism might be more global is suggested by findings after PP2A inhibition of another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468, that resulted in decreased c-fos mRNA stability through interaction with AUUA sequences in the c-fos 3′-UTR, suggesting that PP2A may increase c-fos mRNA stability as well (38Farhana L. Boyanapalli M. Tschang S.-H. Sun R.-J. Hsu C.K. Zhang Y.-X. Fontana J.A. Rishi A.K. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 541-550PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using the specific proteasomal inhibitor MG132 in conjunction with OA treatment clearly provide a link between PP2A and the proteasome. MG132 treatment reversed the OA-mediated ER mRNA decay, indicating that PP2A regulates ER expression through modulation of the ER 3′-UTR, resulting in proteasomal degradation (Fig. 8), suggesting that ER mRNA decay is regulated by PP2A-mediated binding of a factor to the 3′-UTR. Proteasomal degradation of this protein leads to ER mRNA degradation in the absence of PP2A activity. We, therefore, propose that PP2A-mediated ER mRNA stability depends on the presence of and protein binding to the ER 3′-UTR. In summary, our data suggest that PP2A plays a significant role in ER gene expression by increasing ER mRNA stability and half-life. Further, the importance of the 3′-UTR region in regulating ER expression is highlighted. Finally, these studies that utilize cell lines that endogenously express ER as a physiologically relevant model suggest that PP2A could be an effective treatment target."

They also secrete cathepsin G, a serine protease implicated in cytokine release, receptor activation, and degradation of tissue proteins. Isolated cathepsin G was inactivated by HOCl but not by hydrogen peroxide in vitro. We found that activated neutrophils lost cathepsin G activity by a pathway requiring myeloperoxidase, suggesting that oxidants generated by myeloperoxidase might regulate cathepsin G activity in vivo. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of oxidized cathepsin G revealed that loss of a peptide containing Asp108, which lies in the active site, associated quantitatively with loss of enzymatic activity. Catalytic domain peptides containing Asp108 were lost from the oxidized protein in concert with the conversion of Met110 to the sulfoxide. Release of this peptide was blocked by pretreating cathepsin G with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, strongly implying that oxidation introduced proteolytic cleavage sites into cathepsin G. Model system studies demonstrated that methionine oxidation can direct the regiospecific proteolysis of peptides by cathepsin G. Thus, oxidation of Met110 may contribute to cathepsin G inactivation by at least two distinct mechanisms. One involves direct oxidation of the thioether residue adjacent to the aspartic acid in the catalytic domain. The other involves the generation of new sites that are susceptible to proteolysis by cathepsin G. These observations raise the possibility that oxidants derived from neutrophils restrain pericellular proteolysis by inactivating cathepsin G. They also suggest that methionine oxidation could render cathepsin G susceptible to autolytic cleavage. Myeloperoxidase may thus play a previously unsuspected role in regulating tissue injury by serine proteases during inflammation.

Myeloperoxidase may thus play a previously unsuspected role in regulating tissue injury by serine proteases during inflammation. Neutrophils play a key role in host defense by migrating to sites of infection, where they phagocytose invading microorganisms (1Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). After a neutrophil encloses a microbe, the resulting phagosome fuses with granules containing microbicidal and digestive enzymes to form a phagolysosome. The azurophilic granules of neutrophils are rich in serine proteases, including cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase, which play critical roles in killing bacteria (2Travis J. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat.

Nature. 2002; 416: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Although such proteases are important for tissue homeostasis and host defense, an imbalance between proteases and their inhibitors is implicated in tissue damage during inflammation (5Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (3841) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that plasma-derived inhibitors of cathepsin G, such as α1-antichymotrypsin and α1-antitrypsin, help limit proteolysis (6Travis J. Salvensen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). However, traditional enzyme kinetics cannot fully explain the regulation of proteolysis by neutrophils. Thus, even in the presence of plasma-derived protease inhibitors, neutrophils produce evanescent “quantum bursts” of pericellular proteolytic activity (7Campbell E.J. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Owen C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G could thus promote local proteolysis of a range of protein and peptide substrates, including cytokines, neutrophil chemoattractants, clotting factors, extracellular matrix, and G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (8Turkington P.T. Thromb. Res. 1992; 67: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

It contains the catalytic triad Asp108-His64-Ser201, which forms a charge relay system that cleaves the peptide bond of proteins.

The site for amidolysis is defined as the peptide bond between amino acids P1 and P1′ in the substrate peptide Pn... P2, P1, P1′, P2′... Pn′ (13Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 32: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The primary specificity pocket, S1, which accommodates the side chain of the P1 amino acid of a peptide substrate, provides the critical interaction site for serine proteases (12Czapinska H. Otlewski J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G has the unusual ability to recognize either large, hydrophobic amino acids (Phe, Leu, and Met) or basic amino acids (Lys and Arg) in the P1 site of target peptides and proteins (12Czapinska H. Otlewski J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Maison C.M. Villiers C.L. Colomb M.G. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 921-926PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tanaka T.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), indicating that it has both chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like specificity. Phagocytosis of pathogens by neutrophils triggers a burst of cyanide-insensitive oxygen consumption by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (17Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin.

This membrane-associated electron transport system generates superoxide, which dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Another major component of azurophilic granules, myeloperoxidase, can use H2O2 and chloride ions to generate hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent cytotoxic oxidant (Reaction 1) (19Harrison J.E.

A. 2001; 98: 11961-11966Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Recent studies with mice deficient in myeloperoxidase or cathepsin G strongly support the proposal that these enzymes are necessary for killing fungi and Gram-negative bacteria (21Gaut J.P. Yeh G.C.

However, reactive intermediates produced by myeloperoxidase have also been implicated in tissue damage at sites of inflammation (23Heinecke J.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 133: 321-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, oxidation products identical to those generated by the enzyme in vitro have been found in proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids in inflamed human tissue (24Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin.

Moreover, phagocytes store myeloperoxidase and cathepsin G in the same secretory compartment, and degranulation of these components is likely to create high local concentrations of both enzymes near the cell surface (28Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Sannes P.L. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), where NADPH oxidase is located. Indeed, secreted cathepsin G binds tightly to the cell surface of neutrophils (2Travis J. Am. J. Med. 1988; 84: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 3Belaaouaj A.

Gabella G. Potma E.O. Warley A. Roes J. Segal A.W. Nature. 2002; 416: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Oxidative modulation of the inflammatory response may be a general regulatory mechanism, because HOCl can inactivate a wide range of products that are secreted by neutrophils (29Voetman A.A. Weening R.S. Hamers M.N. Meerhof L.J. Bot A.A. Roos D. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 67: 1541-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Kobayashi M. Tanaka T. Usui T. J. Lab. Clin.

However, the molecular details of protein oxidation by reactive intermediates remain poorly understood. In the current studies, we demonstrate that HOCl, a specific product of myeloperoxidase, potently inactivates cathepsin G by a pathway that involves oxidation of a specific methionine residue and autolytic cleavage. This finding raises the possibility that myeloperoxidase might restrain the activity of cathepsin G near the surface of neutrophils. If so, it might help limit, rather than promote, inadvertent proteolysis of host proteins and tissue. Cathepsin G (from human sputum, salt-free, lyophilized) was obtained from Elastin Products Co. (Owensville, MO). NaOCl, H2O2, CF3COOH, and HPLC grade CH3CN were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Unless otherwise indicated, all other materials were purchased from Sigma. Oxidation Reactions—Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min in buffer A (10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, containing 138 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) with 1 μm or the indicated concentrations of cathepsin G or 400 μm TIQNDIMLLQLSR (Biopeptide, San Diego, CA). Reactions were initiated by adding oxidant (HOCl or H2O2) and terminated by adding a 10-fold mole excess (relative to oxidant) of l-methionine. Concentrations of HOCl and H2O2 were determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ292 = 350 m-1 cm-1 and ϵ240 = 39.4 m-1 cm-1, respectively (32Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 33Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar)). Human Neutrophils—Human neutrophils were isolated from EDTA-anti-coagulated blood by buoyant density centrifugation using Polymorph-Prep (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) (34Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were washed twice at 4 °C by centrifugation in buffer B (Hanks' balanced salt solution, pH 7.4; prepared without calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, and phenol red (Invitrogen); 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was included to inhibit metal-catalyzed reactions (35Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar)). Neutrophils were resuspended in buffer B at 37 °C and immediately used for experiments. Cathepsin G (1 μm) was exposed for 1 h to neutrophil (1 × 106 cells/ml) in buffer B at 37 °C. Neutrophils were activated with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Reactions were terminated by pelletting the cells by centrifugation at 4 °C. Supernatants were concentrated under vacuum and digested with trypsin for mass spectrometric analysis. Cathepsin G Enzymatic Activity—Following the addition of l-methionine to scavenge oxidants, the activity of cathepsin G (70 nm) was assayed in buffer C (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) using 510 μm N-succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide (suc-AAPF-NA) as substrate (36DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Control experiments demonstrated that l-methionine did not affect the activity of cathepsin G. Suc-AAPF-NA (6.4 mm) was initially solubilized in Me2SO. Samples were incubated in individual wells of a 96-well microtiter plate at 37 °C after adding suc-AAPF-NA, and the initial rate of change in absorbance was monitored at 410 nm (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To determine cathepsin G activity in neutrophils, quiescent and activated neutrophils were sonicated and then incubated with 510 μm suc-AAPF-NA for 60 min at 37 °C in buffer C (pH 7.4). Each reaction mixture was clarified by centrifugation, and the initial rate of change in absorbance of the supernatant was determined at 410 nm (37MacIvor D.M. Shapiro S.D. Pham C.T. Belaaouaj A. Abraham S.N. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed on proteins separated by SDS-PAGE using an antibody specific for cathepsin G (37MacIvor D.M. Shapiro S.D. Pham C.T. Belaaouaj A. Abraham S.N. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For proteolysis studies, oxidized or native TIQNDIMLLQLSR (400 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with cathepsin G (2 μm) in buffer A. To inactivate cathepsin G, enzyme was incubated with 3.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; stock solution 35 mm in ethanol) in buffer A at 0 °C for 30 min, and then extensively dialyzed against buffer A (containing 10% ethanol) at 4 °C. Mice Deficient in Myeloperoxidase—All procedures involving animals were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Myeloperoxidase-deficient mice were generated by targeted mutagenesis (38Brennan M.L. Anderson M.M. Shih D.M. Qu X.D. Wang X.P. Mehta A.C. Lim L.L. Shi W.B. Hazen S.L. Jacob J.S. Crowley J.R.

Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided with water and food ad libitum. Wild type and mutant mice were littermates derived from interbreeding of heterozygous mice, were in the C57/BL6 genetic back-ground, and were sex- and age- (8-10 weeks) matched. Neutrophils were isolated from bone marrow and the peritoneum as described previously (37MacIvor D.M. Shapiro S.D. Pham C.T. Belaaouaj A. Abraham S.N. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC—Synthetic peptides and cathepsin G proteolytic products were separated on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS column, 25 × 2.1 mm i.d., Grace Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using a Beckman HPLC system (Fullerton, CA). Peptides were detected by monitoring absorbance at 214 nm. Peptides were eluted using solvent A (0.06% CF3COOH in H2O) and solvent B (0.06% CF3COOH in 80% CH3CN and 20% H2O) with a linear gradient of 10% to 60% solvent B over 60 min. LC-ESI-MS—Cathepsin G was incubated overnight at 37 °C with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 25:1 (w/w) cathepsin G/trypsin in buffer D (1 m urea, 50 mm NH4HCO3). Before trypsin digestion, cathepsin G was reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide. Digestion was halted by acidifying with CF3COOH to a final pH of 2-3. LC-ESI mass spectrometric analyses (39Fu X. Kassim S.Y. Parks W.C. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

Peptides were separated on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18 MS column, 25 × 2.1 mm i.d.) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using solvent C (0.2% HCOOH in H2O) and solvent D (0.2% HCOOH in 80% CH3CN and 20% H2O). Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient of the following: 10% to 40% solvent D over 50 min, and then 40% to 70% solvent D over 10 min for tryptic digests; 10% solvent D for 5 min, and then 10% to 50% solvent D over 55 min for cathepsin G proteolysis of native or oxidized cathepsin G; and 10% to 50% solvent D over 60 min for synthetic peptides. The electrospray needle was held at 4500 V. The sheath gas, nitrogen, was set at 80 units. The collision gas was helium. The temperature of the heated capillary was 220 °C. Cathepsin G Is Inactivated by HOCl but Not by H2O2—To assess whether reactive intermediates generated by phagocytes can directly influence the proteolytic activity of cathepsin G, we exposed the enzyme to HOCl, H2O2, or the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- system for 30 min at 37 °C at neutral pH in a physiological buffer containing plasma concentrations of chloride, sodium, and phosphate. After adding methionine to scavenge any residual oxidant, we determined whether the enzyme could degrade suc-AAPF-NA, a synthetic peptide substrate (33Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Cathepsin G exposed to increasing concentrations of HOCl progressively lost its proteolytic activity, which was inhibited by ∼50% at a 10:1 mole ratio of HOCl to protein (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A). Higher concentrations of HOCl completely inhibited proteolysis. In striking contrast, the same range of H2O2 concentrations did not affect the proteolytic activity cathepsin G (Figs. 1A and 2A). Cathepsin G exposed to the complete myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- system also lost activity (Fig. 1A). Inactivation required each component of the reaction mixture: myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and Cl- (data not shown). The IC50 for HOCl and peroxide in the complete myeloperoxidase system were ∼10:1 and 20:1 (mol: mol), respectively (Fig. 1A). Inactivation of cathepsin G by the myeloperoxidase system was blocked by catalase, a scavenger of H2O2, and azide or 3-aminotriazole, two inhibitors of heme enzymes (data not shown). Methionine, a potent scavenger of HOCl, also blocked the reaction. These results demonstrate that inactivation of cathepsin G by myeloperoxidase requires active enzyme, Cl-, and H2O2.Fig. 2Proteolytic activity (A) and abundance of peptide TIQNDIMLLQLSR (B) of cathepsin G exposed to HOCl or H2O2. Cathepsin G (17 μm) was incubated with HOCl or H2O2 at the indicated mole ratio and its enzymatic activity was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. A, enzymatic activity of cathepsin G.

We used high concentrations of cathepsin G (17 μm) for these experiments to facilitate MS analysis of the protein. It is important to note, however, that inactivation of cathepsin G depended only on the mole ratio of oxidant to protein (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, when 200 nm cathepsin G was exposed to 3 μm HOCl (a 15:1 mole ratio of oxidant to protein), the activity of the proteinase was inhibited by ∼85%. These observations indicate that physiologically plausible concentrations of HOCl, but not H2O2, can convert cathepsin G to a catalytically inactive form. The trypsin digest of native cathepsin G contained 18 peptides that covered 70% of the sequence of the native protein. Due to poor retention on the HPLC column, we were unable to identify small peptides and single amino acid residues. When cathepsin G was exposed to HOCl (15:1, oxidant/protein, mol/mol) and digested with trypsin, LC-ESI-MS analysis revealed eight new peaks of material (Table I). MS/MS analysis indicated that the eight peptides were derived from residues 35-48, 104-116, and 132-149 of cathepsin G. Five of the peptides (derived from all three regions of the protein) exhibited an increase of 16 atomic mass units, suggesting that each one had gained 1 oxygen atom (Table I). MS/MS analysis demonstrated that methionine was oxygenated in four of these peptides (Met+16) and that tryptophan was oxygenated in the fifth (Try+16). The sixth peptide had gained 32 atomic mass units, and its methionine had been converted to a sulfone, while the seventh and eighth peptides (derived from residues 132-149) had lost 2 or 4 atomic mass units, respectively. We recently showed that oxidative cross-linking of adjacent tryptophan and glycine residues creates these modifications (40Fu X. Kao J.L. Bergt C. Kassim S.Y. Huq N.P. d'Avignon A. Parks W.C.

In contrast, we observed only a very low level of one oxidized peptide (residues 104-116) in native cathepsin G or cathepsin G that was exposed to H2O2. These observations indicate that HOCl, but not H2O2, extensively oxidizes methionine residues in cathepsin G. It should be noted that HOCl reacts much more rapidly than H2O2 with thioethers (42Pattison D.I. Davies M.J. Chem. Res.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the relationship between inactivation of cathepsin G by HOCl and the appearance of oxidation products in the enzyme, we focused on TIQNDIMLLQLSR, one of the tryptic digest peptides containing the Asp108 of the catalytic triad (Table I). Cathepsin G exposed to increasing concentrations of oxidant was digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-ESI-MS. At low concentrations of HOCl (5-20:1, mol/mol, oxidant/protein), loss of the native peptide TIQNDIMLLQLSR associated quantitatively with loss of enzymatic activity (Fig. 2). In striking contrast, cathepsin G was not inactivated by the same concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, there was no loss of TIQNDIMLLQLSR in cathepsin G exposed to H2O2 (Fig. 2B). These results implicate oxidative modification of TIQNDIMLLQLSR in the loss of enzymatic activity of cathepsin G exposed to low mole ratios of HOCl. HOCl Oxidizes Specific Methionine Residues to Generate Unique Proteolytic Cleavage Sites in Cathepsin G—Because loss of the peptide TIQNDIMLLQLSR (residues 104-116) associated strongly with loss of enzymatic activity, we used reconstructed ion chromatograms (Fig. 3) and MS/MS analyses (Fig. 4) to characterize this region of cathepsin G after oxidation with HOCl and digestion with trypsin. Peptides TIQNDI(M+16)LLQLSR, TIQNDI(M+16)LL, and NDI(M+16)LL were observed in cathepsin G that had been oxidized with HOCl but not in native enzyme or cathepsin G exposed to H2O2 (Figs. 3 and 4). All three peptides contained methionine sulfoxide (Met+16). Importantly, two resulted from cleavage at a P1 site (Leu112) recognized by cathepsin G but not by trypsin (which recognizes Arg and Lys). The third, NDI(M+16)LL, was cleaved at Gln-Asn at the N terminus of the peptide as well as at Leu112 in the P1 site. Because native cathepsin G has not been reported to recognize Gln in the P1 site, HOCl appears to generate new proteolytic cleavage sites by oxidizing specific methionine residues in cathepsin G. Because cathepsin G can cleave proteins and peptides at P1 sites that contain leucine residues and because we observed only TIQNDI(M+16)LL and NDI(M+16)LL in the oxidized protease, oxidation of Met110 could generate a site in cathepsin G that the enzyme can cleave. Importantly, all three peptides also contained Asp108, which lies in the catalytic triad of the enzyme, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage might help inactivate the protease.Fig. 4MS and MS/MS analysis of cathepsin G exposed to HOCl. Cathepsin G was incubated in buffer A alone or buffer A supplemented with HOCl (15:1, mol/mol, oxidant/protein), digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-"
https://openalex.org/W2063284451,"Abstract Eighteen human histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been identified, and according to their sequence similarity to yeast homologs, these enzymes are grouped into distinct classes. Within class II, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9 share similar domain organization both within the N-terminal extension and the C-terminal catalytic domain, thus forming a subclass known as class IIa. These HDACs function as signal-responsive transcriptional corepressors. To gain further insight into their function and regulation, we utilized an N-terminal fragment of HDAC4 as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens, which uncovered myocyte enhancer factor 2C, 14-3-3ζ, and ankyrin repeat family A protein (ANKRA). ANKRA is a poorly characterized protein with an ankyrin repeat domain similar to RFXANK, a subunit of the trimeric transcription factor RFX. Mutations on genes of the RFX subunits and the coactivator CIITA are responsible for the bare lymphocyte syndrome, an immunodeficiency disorder attributed to the lack of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) antigens. Through its ankyrin repeat domain, RFXANK interacted with HDAC4. Two RFXANK-binding sites were found on HDAC4 with one located within residues 118–279 and another within residues 448–666. Interestingly, this deacetylase also interacted with CIITA. Consistent with the physical interaction with RFXANK and CIITA, HDAC4 and homologs repressed MHCII expression. These results identify ANKRA, RFXANK, and CIITA as novel targets of class IIa HDACs and suggest that these deacetylases play a role in regulating MHCII expression."
https://openalex.org/W1968336657,"The overexpression of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6-kinase has recently been shown to protect HEK293 cells from tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis. This overexpression leads to an increase in the levels of both inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6). Cells that overexpress InsP5 2-kinase have increased levels of InsP6 and are also protected from TNFα-induced apoptosis; furthermore, cells that express an RNA interference construct to the 2-kinase are deficient in InsP6 and are sensitized to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Therefore the protective effect of 5/6-kinase on TNFα-mediated apoptosis is due to an increase of InsP6 or to a metabolite derived from InsP6. Furthermore, we find that the InsP6 also protects from Fas-mediated apoptosis. No effect was seen in the endocytic rate of transferrin receptor, caspase 8 activity, or TNF receptor number at the cell surface. Cells that overexpress 2-kinase do show an increase in the amount of receptor-interacting protein (RIP), while cells with reduced InsP6 levels show relatively less RIP, providing a possible mechanism for the effect on apoptosis.

In mammalian cells, InsP3 is phosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate by an InsP3 3-kinase and dephosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4)P3) by a 5-phosphatase (4Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Ins(1,3,4)P3 is then phosphorylated to inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,6)P4) by the Ins(1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase, to inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) by Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 5-kinase, and to inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6) by InsP5 2-kinase (1Verbsky J.W.

In cell culture, production of InsP6 is regulated by the activity of 5/6-kinase, which is rate-limiting (6Verbsky J.W. Chang S.C. Wilson M.P. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1911-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) producing the committed isomer in the synthesis of InsP6, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. Overexpression of 5/6-kinase results in an increase in InsP5 and InsP6, while depletion of 5/6-kinase results in the loss of InsP5 and InsP6. Another function for the inositol (1,3,4)P3 5/6-kinase other than phosphorylating inositol phosphates was recently discovered. Wilson et al. (7Wilson M.P. Sun Y. Cao L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

TNFα is involved in numerous processes including cell death and development and oncogenesis and immune, inflammatory, and stress responses (11Chen G.Q. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). TNFα acts in opposing ways with regards to apoptosis. Through one arm of the pathway it can activate transcription by NFκB; TRADD is recruited to the TNF receptor through its death domains, and it in turn recruits RIP, a death domain-containing kinase, and TRAF2. Together TRAF2 and RIP recruit and activate IκB kinase complex, which phosphorylates IκBα, signaling it for ubiquitination and destruction. NFκB is then translocated to the nucleus to stimulate transcription. Two of the many transcriptional targets of NFκB are FLIP and cIAP, proteins that inhibit apoptosis, and thus NFκB activity is considered anti-apoptotic. The second of the pathways it shares with Fas; this pathway stimulates apoptosis by recruiting FADD and caspase 8, which results in the cleavage and activation of caspase 8, initiating the caspase cascade. The pro-apoptotic action of TNFα cannot overcome its anti-apoptotic activity through NFκB in most cells; thus, to induce apoptosis in cells, protein synthesis has to be inhibited or NFκB signaling has to be blocked. The ability of 5/6-kinase to phosphorylate proteins involved in TNFα-mediated apoptosis led Sun et al. (12Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to determine whether the overexpression of 5/6-kinase had an effect on apoptosis. They found that HEK293 cells were protected from TNFα-induced apoptosis when there were elevated amounts of 5/6-kinase. They investigated whether this protection was due to increased NFκB signaling, but they found no difference in IκBα stability or NFκB activity by gel shifts of 5/6-kinase-expressing lines. This led to the possibility that the protection from apoptosis was due to inhibition of caspase activation rather than NFκB stimulation. It also suggested that the protection from apoptosis may not be due to the associated protein kinase activity of 5/6-kinase but rather through its inositol phosphate kinase activity and thus to the soluble, more highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates. We recently have shown that an increase in 5/6-kinase activity in cells results in a concomitant increase of InsP5 and InsP6. Thus activities ascribed to the inositol phosphate kinase function of 5/6-kinase may be due to actions of InsP5 or InsP6 or to another downstream metabolite. Here we show that expression of 2-kinase and an increase of InsP6 can protect cells from TNFα-mediated apoptosis, and we attribute the protective effect of 5/6-kinase on TNFα-mediated apoptosis to the production of InsP6 itself. In addition, we find that expression of 2-kinase also results in a protection from Fas mediated apoptosis, and thus InsP6 may be a general regulator of apoptosis. Furthermore, we notice that altered InsP6 levels in cells result in altered levels of the protein RIP, which may provide a mechanism for the role of InsP6 in apoptosis.

Bacterial strains were cultured in LB (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, pH 7.4) medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) where appropriate and transformed by standard methods. All bacterial strains were grown at 37 °C Cloning, Production, and Maintenance of Cell Lines—Stable cell lines expressing 2-kinase were reported previously (6Verbsky J.W. Chang S.C. Wilson M.P.

Oligonucleotides containing the antisense target to the 2-kinase (5′-GAAGACCTCGGAAGAGATA-3′) or to luciferase (5′-CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA-3′) were annealed and ligated in the pSUPER vector (a gift from Dr. Reuven Agami). Equal amounts of either the 2-kinase or the luciferase RNAi construct were mixed 7:1 with pBabe containing a puromycin resistance gene and transfected into the same parent cells as the overexpression lines, TRex HEK293(Invitrogen), using Lipofectamine as per the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were allowed to recover for 1 day and serially diluted, and clones were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin. Individual clones were obtained and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml puromycin. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—HPLC was conducted as follows. Cell were grown in the presence of [3H]inositol (10 μCi/ml) for 4 days. Cells were lysed in methanol/0.5 n HCl (2:1) and extracted with chloroform. The aqueous phase was separated, dried, and resuspended in distilled water. Samples were applied to a Whatman Partisphere SAX strong anion exchange column (4.6 mm x125 mm) running a 30 min gradient from 0 to 1.7 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, followed by a 30-min isocratic elution with 1.7 m ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5. Radioactivity was measured using the inline detector β-RAM (IN/US System Inc.), and the identity of the individual inositol phosphates was assigned on the basis of co-elution with known standards. Apoptotic Cell Staining—Cells were grown on polylysine-treated coverslips to ∼80% confluence, then treated with 1 ng/ml TNFα (Peprotech) and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) for 18 h. Apoptotic cells were detected using the APOPercentage apoptotic kit (Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY). Western Blot Analysis—Specified tissue culture cells were removed from the plates by gentle aspiration, washed with PBS, and lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Cells were treated to two freeze-thaw cycles in an ethanol-dry ice bath, and particulate debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the clarified lysate was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Using standard techniques, 25 μg of protein of each sample was loaded onto a 10% gel for SDS-PAGE and subsequently electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Western analysis was conducted using anti-PARP polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling) using standard techniques. The appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) were used to visualize the appropriate bands. Where indicated, bands were compared by densitometry of Western blots using an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 440 CF, and the data were analyzed using Kodak 1D V.3.5.4 (Scientific Imaging System). TNFα or Fas treatment of HEK293 Cells—2 × 105 cells were plated in 12-well plates in the presence (for the 2-kinase-expressing lines or vector control) or absence (for 2-kinase RNAi or luciferase control lines) of tetracycline for 24 h and then treated with TNFα (1 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (1 μg/ml) or the stated amount of Fas antibody plus protein G (a 4:1 ratio of Fas to protein G) for the indicated amount of time. Extracts were processed for Western blots as described above. 2-Kinase RNAi Construct Expression in 5/6-Kinase-expressing Cells—5/6-Kinase cells lines were transfected with the same 2-kinase RNAi construct used to generate stable cell lines, grown for 1 day to recover, then split into 12-well plates and grown for 24 h in the presence of tetracycline to induce 5/6-kinase expression. These cells were then treated for various times with TNFα and cycloheximide as above. Transferrin Uptake—Cells were incubated with 125I-transferrin (0.25 μg/ml) in binding medium (0.1% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) at 37 °C for 1-8 min. At the end of the incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the monolayers were rapidly washed three times with cold PBS to remove unbound ligand. The cells were then incubated for 5 min with 0.2 m acetic acid, pH 2.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl at 4 °C. The acid wash was combined with a short rinse in the same buffer and used to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-ligand. The cells were lysed in 1 n NaOH to determine the intracellular (internalized) radioactivity. The ratio of internalized to surface radioactivity was plotted against time. At 10 min, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ligand was added, and the cells were treated as before to determine the background binding. Immunoprecipitation—For caspase 8 co-immunoprecipitations, two 90% confluent p150 tissue culture plates treated as indicated were used for each immunoprecipitation. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 plus protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche)) for 30 min on ice. An equal mass of each lysate was precleared on protein G-agarose for 1 h, and the caspase 8 complex was precipitated with 2 μg of anti-caspase 8 antibody and 50 μl of protein G-agarose at 4 °C overnight. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer, and subjected to Western analysis as above. To ensure that equal amounts of caspase 8 were being precipitated, 5% of the precipitated protein was run on a separate gel and blotted with mAb against caspase 8. Total cellular RIP was immunoprecipitated as follows: 0.5 × 106 cells were plated on 6-well plates and grown for 24 h. Cells from each well were lysed as for the caspase 8 immunoprecipitations, and RIP was precipitated with 1 μg of anti-RIP mAb for 1 h. The complexes were precipitated with 25 μl of protein G-agarose for 30 min and washed three times with PBS, and the pellets were subjected to Western blot analysis as above. HEK293 Cells Expressing a Stably Transfected RNAi Construct to the 2-Kinase Result in Altered InsP6 Profiles—HEK293 cell lines constructed with a tetracycline inducible 2-kinase gene show an altered inositol phosphate profile as reported previously; specifically, expression of the 2-kinase resulted in an increase in InsP6 and a loss of InsP5. We also generated HEK293 cells stably transfected with an RNAi construct to the 2-kinase. As a control we produced cell lines transfected with the pSUPER construct containing an RNAi insert to the luciferase gene. When these cells were labeled with [3H]inositol, and their soluble inositol phosphates purified and separated by HPLC, there is a decrease of InsP6 relative to the controls by about 70% (cf. Fig. 1, B to A) and an increase in InsP5 and pyrophosphorylated InsP4. This result is consistent with inositol labeling of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with siRNAs to 2-kinase as reported previously (1Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31857-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 2-Kinase-expressing Cells Are Resistant to TNFα-mediated Apoptosis, whereas 2-Kinase RNAi Lines Are More Susceptible to Apoptosis—5/6-Kinase-overexpressing cells show an increase of InsP5 and InsP6 and a protection from TNFα-induced apoptosis. 2-Kinase-overexpressing cells show increased InsP6 and a loss of InsP5. When treated with TNFα 2-kinase-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B) show a relative decrease in the number of apoptotic cells, as determined by APOPercentage staining, when compared with vector cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, relative to the luciferase lines (Fig. 2C) the 2-kinase RNAi lines (Fig. 2D) showed more apoptotic staining when treated with TNFα. The results shown in Fig. 2 were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Cells expressing 2-kinase and the vector control were treated with TNFα and cycloheximide for 7 and 24 h and their extracts blotted with a polyclonal antibody against PARP, a target of caspase 3. Consistent with the results from the cell staining, cells overexpressing 2-kinase showed a decrease in the amount of apoptosis as determined by the amount of cleaved PARP relative to the vector lines at both time points (Fig. 3A). We also looked at cleaved PARP accumulation in 2-kinase RNAi lines. Compared with the luciferase lines, the 2-kinase RNAi line showed more cleaved PARP at 7 and 24 h, and is therefore more susceptible to TNFα mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3B). In both sets of experiments, the amount of apoptosis seen in the tetracycline-induced vector lines was greater than that seen in the luciferase RNAi control lines. Since the vector lines were treated with tetracycline, the transcription machinery was induced by the addition of tetracycline, as it is in the 2-kinase-expressing lines. The RNAi lines were not treated with tetracycline. This may account for the difference between the control lines. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the increase or decrease of apoptosis relative to their respective control. The 2-Kinase RNAi Construct Can Overcome the Protection from Apoptosis of 5/6-Kinase Expression—To address whether the protective effect was solely due to the presence of InsP6 and does not involve other products resulting from 5/6-kinase and its associated protein kinase activity, we expressed the 2-kinase RNAi construct in cells overexpressing 5/6-kinase. There was an increase in apoptosis in the cells transfected with the 2-kinase RNAi relative to those transfected with the luciferase RNAi (Fig. 4). Taken with the above results, we conclude that the protective effect from TNFα-mediated apoptosis is due to the presence of InsP6 or a downstream metabolite. Increased InsP6 Protects against FAS-mediated Apoptosis, while Decreased InsP6 Levels Render Cells More Susceptible to FAS-mediated Apoptosis—In addition to protection from TNFα-mediated apoptosis, we also found that 2-kinase overexpression could protect cells from Fas-induced apoptosis as shown in Fig. 5. Cell lines were treated with increasing amounts of Fas antibody for 20 h, and their cell extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for PARP. Cells that were overexpressing the 2-kinase showed less PARP cleavage at 1 and 3 μg/ml as compared with the vector control lines (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the 2-kinase RNAi line showed more apoptosis as compared with the luciferase control (Fig. 5B). The results of PARP cleavage for the 6 μg/ml Fas treatment were analyzed by densitometry to normalize loading. Whereas the ratio of full-length PARP to tubulin were similar for RNAi and Luciferase lines (1.7 to 1.6, respectively), the ratio of cleaved PARP to tubulin was almost three times greater in the RNAi line than luciferase line (0.41 to 0.15, respectively). Therefore, relatively more PARP is cleaved in the RNAi line than the luciferase line. Alterations in InsP6 Levels Do Not Affect Receptor Internalization, Caspase 8 Activity, or TNF Receptor Number—Since it is unlikely that the protective effect of the 2-kinase on apoptosis is due to NFκB activation, we looked for other cellular alterations that would explain the protective effect. Receptor internalization is required for TNF induced apoptosis and is mediated by a canonical YXXW motif known to mediate receptor internalization by clathrin-coated vesicles (15Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar); when mutated, TNF receptor internalization is inhibited, and the death inducing signaling complex is not formed, thus blocking apoptosis. Since InsP6 has been implicated in endocytosis, we measured transferrin internalization in cells overexpressing the 2-kinase. As seen in Fig. 6, 2-kinase overexpression does not affect transferrin internalization compared with vector control. The regression coefficient of four experiments, denoting the internalization constant (κd), was averaged and showed no difference between the 2-kinase or vector lines. Furthermore, we saw no difference in internalization rates between 2-kinase and luciferase lines (data not shown). We also measured the TNF and Fas receptor number at the cell surface by FACS analysis and found no difference between the cell lines containing increased amounts of InsP6 and those with depleted levels of InsP6. Finally, caspase 8 activity was assayed with increasing amounts of InsP6 or inositol hexakissulfate to control for nonspecific charge effect, and no effect was seen on caspase 8 activity up to 100 μm InsP6 or inositol hexakissulfate. 2-Kinase-overexpressing Cells and 2-Kinase RNAi Lines Showed Altered Levels of the Anti-apoptotic Protein RIP—Western blotting of 25 μg of cell lysate showed an increase in the level of RIP in the 2-kinase-expressing lines as compared with the vector control and a decrease in the RNAi stable lines as compared with the luciferase control (Fig. 7). When normalized to the tubulin control, RIP levels were increased by about 50% in the 2-kinase-expressing lines and decreased by about 50% in the RNAi lines. The elevated amount of RIP in cellular extracts is reflected in an increase in co-immunoprecipitations of RIP with anti-caspase 8. The method of Micheau and Tschopp (16Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar, 17.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) was employed to address the effect of the 2-kinase on the formation of the caspase 8/TRADD/RIP complex with the TNF receptor. Interestingly, it was unnecessary to stimulate cells with TNF to co-immunoprecipitate RIP with caspase 8, suggesting that the complex forms to a small degree in cells unstimulated with TNFα. When HEK293 cells expressed 2-kinase, more RIP protein was precipitated with caspase 8 as compared with the vector controls (Fig. 8). Treatment of these cells with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 restored the level of RIP in the immunoprecipitations in the vector lines equal to that of the 2-kinase lines. These results would suggest that in these cells 2-kinase overexpression affects the turnover rate of the caspase 8, FADD, TRADD, and RIP co-complex. The overexpression of 5/6-kinase has been shown by Sun et al. (12Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to protect against TNFα-mediated apoptosis, although the mechanism was unknown. Since the overexpression of 5/6-kinase also results in an elevation in the amounts of InsP5 and InsP6 (1Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31857-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is possible that this protective effect is due to one or more of these isomers of inositol phosphate. Cells overexpressing 2-kinase accumulate InsP6, deplete InsP5, and show protection from apoptosis relative to vector controls. Furthermore, HEK293 cells stably transfected with an RNAi construct to 2-kinase deplete InsP6 and accumulate InsP5 and show an increased susceptibility to apoptosis. In addition, expression of 5/6-kinase was not able to overcome the susceptibility to apoptosis caused by expression of the 2-kinase RNAi construct. This result confirms the data of Sun et al. (12Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that suggested that the protective effect of the 5/6-kinase on apoptosis is not due to its protein kinase activity but rather to its inositol kinase activity. Thus, the protection from apoptosis is due to InsP6 or possibly some more highly phosphorylated inositol phosphate. In addition, we have shown that overexpression of 2-kinase protects from Fas-induced apoptosis, while 2-kinase RNAi expression renders the cells more sensitive to Fas-induced apoptosis. Taken together, the two studies support each other in their implication that soluble inositol phosphates are regulators of apoptosis. As mentioned above, our results do not conclusively implicate InsP6 itself in the protection from apoptosis; we can only say that the isomer involved has to lie downstream of InsP6. InsP6 is metabolized to the higher inositol pyrophosphates InsP7 and InsP8. We, though, have seen no increase in an InsP7 isomer when expressing the 2-kinase in metabolically labeled cells (data not shown), and there is some evidence that the inositol pyrophosphates may stimulate apoptosis. Morrison et al. (18Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lindner D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24965-24970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) used an antisense technique to identify genes that are involved in interferon β1-induced apoptosis in an ovarian carcinoma cell line. One gene that was shown to sensitize these cells to interferon β-induced apoptosis was the inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2. This protein converts InsP6 to the pyrophosphate InsP7. Interferon β acts by stimulating transcription through the JAK/STAT pathway. Interestingly, the transcription of a number of targets stimulated by INFβ are involved in TNFα-mediated apoptosis (e.g. caspases 8) or are analogous to TNF apoptosis, e.g. TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand). Since InsP6 kinases phosphorylate InsP6, their expression may result in the depletion of cellular levels of InsP6, which we show here to sensitize cells to apoptosis. Thus the balance between InsP6 and the inositol pyrophosphates may act as a switch controlling apoptosis. Nonetheless, such speculation requires experiments with the InsP6 kinases to determine definitively the inositol isomer involved. The protection from apoptosis afforded by expression of the 2-kinase probably is not due to the known anti-apoptotic consequences of TNFα, namely through NFκB activation. No decrease in IκB stability or increase in NFκB activity is seen in 5/6-kinase-overexpressing cells. The protection from Fas-mediated apoptosis would argue against the role of NFκΒ activation. Also, the TNFα assays are done in the presence of cycloheximide, where protein synthesis is inhibited. The protective effect may work on the apoptotic branch of TNFα signaling. We addressed a number of the possible steps in the activation of the apoptotic branch of TNFα signaling. We looked at cell surface expression of the TNF receptor between lines that had altered levels of InsP6 and saw no difference nor did we see an effect of InsP6 on caspase 8 activity in vitro. TNF activation has recently been shown to require the internalization of the TNF receptor (19Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). InsP6 has been implicated in endocytosis and could delay activation of caspase 8 by altering the endocytic rate of the receptor. Yet cells with altered levels of InsP6 showed no defect in the uptake of transferrin, and it is unlikely that this would provide the mechanism for the protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, our results provide the first in vivo description of the affect of altered InsP6 levels on endocytosis. Although it has been implicated in endocytosis by a number of studies, we did not see an effect on endocytosis when InsP6 levels were elevated (Fig. 6) or depleted (data not shown). The increase in InsP6 is correlated with an increase in RIP and may provide a mechanism for the protection afforded by an increase in InsP6 levels. RIP-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts are sensitive to TNFα-mediated apoptosis (20Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), likely due to its role recruiting and activating the IκB kinase complex, resulting in the activation of NFκB. Since this does not seem to be involved in the current study, other roles for RIP must be considered. RIP is cleaved by caspase 8 upon TNFα engagement of its receptor, resulting in a C-terminal and N-terminal fragment, and consequently RIP levels drop. Expression of the C-terminal fragment of RIP in cells stimulates the FADD and TRADD interaction, while expression of the full-length RIP inhibits the FADD to TRADD interaction (21Lin Y. Devin A. Rodriguez Y. Liu Z.G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2514-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). If full-length RIP can compete for binding with cRIP to TRADD, this may result in a delay of recruitment of FADD to TRADD and thus delay caspase activation. Our results are consistent with the work by Sun et al. (12Sun Y. Mochizuki Y. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43645-43653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that suggested that the protection from TNFα-mediated apoptosis was due to an inhibition of the recruitment of FADD to TRADD. It is not clear how InsP6 affects RIP levels. Preliminary experiments to determine the effect of InsP6 itself on the half-life of RIP did show that cells deficient in InsP6 lost RIP more quickly when treated with cycloheximide; at 3 h after treatment, RIP levels dropped to 40% of the original level of RIP in the 2-kinase RNAi lines, while they remained at about 90% of the original levels in the luciferase control lines (data not shown). The role of InsP6 is well known in mRNA export. Since RIP is a protein with a relatively short half-life, it may require more efficient export of mRNAs to maintain a level of message for efficient translation of protein. Alternatively, InsP6 may affect its turnover rate by affecting the proteosome or its targeting for degradation by ubiquitination. We thank Shao Chang for his time and intelligent input during discussions regarding this work."

We have analyzed duplex DNA containing the repeat, the individual DNA strands, and the RNA that would be generated by transcription of the repeat. Circular dichroism and UV absorbance measurements suggest that the previously reported tendency of the repeat to unpair when supercoiled is probably related simply to GC content rather than reflecting any unusual property of the duplex.

In contrast r(AUUCU)9 forms a folded structure under physiologically reasonable conditions. S1 nuclease analysis reveals a single region of hypersensitivity in the middle of the repeat tract, whereas V1 digestion is consistent with a hydrogen bonded or well stacked structure. CD spectroscopy shows that the structure is unimolecular and hydrogen bonded and has a significant amount of A-form helix. NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that these hydrogen bonds comprise an equal number of A·U and U·U base pairs. Our data thus suggest that the repeat forms an unusual RNA hairpin. Thus the ability to form an RNA hairpin seems to be a common property of those Repeat Expansion Diseases that are not recessively inherited and are caused by repeats that are transcribed but not translated.

Thus the ability to form an RNA hairpin seems to be a common property of those Repeat Expansion Diseases that are not recessively inherited and are caused by repeats that are transcribed but not translated. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. Onset can be early, with gait ataxia being the most common presenting symptom (1Zu L. Figueroa K.P. Grewal R. Pulst S.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 594-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Matsuura T. Yamagata T. Burgess D.L. Rasmussen A. Grewal R.P. Watase K. Khajavi M.

Other symptoms such as cognitive impairment, mood changes, limb dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, dysarthria, dysphagia, and seizures sometimes follow. The ataxia is progressive and eventually results in loss of the ability to walk. Most cases of SCA10 result from expansion of an ATTCT·AGAAT repeat in intron 9 of the gene that encodes ataxin-10, an evolutionarily conserved protein of unknown function. SCA10 is thus a Repeat Expansion Disease. The repeat numbers in affected alleles are among the largest seen in this group of diseases and range from 800 to >4000 (3Lin X. Ashizawa T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recent data show that loss of ataxin-10 causes apoptosis of cerebellar neurons (4Marz P. Probst A. Lang S. Schwager M. Rose-John S. Otten U. Ozbek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). However, this observation is not necessarily proof of a loss of function mechanism for SCA10. For example, null mutations in the huntingtin gene also cause apoptosis (5Zeitlin S. Liu J.P. Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Efstratiadis A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), yet it is well established that the expansion responsible for this disease causes a toxic gain of function of the huntingtin protein that is responsible for disease pathology (6Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Semin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 6: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Preliminary data suggest that the levels of SCA10 mRNA in cells from affected individuals are not significantly different from those in unaffected individuals (2Matsuura T. Yamagata T. Burgess D.L. Rasmussen A. Grewal R.P. Watase K. Khajavi M. McCall A.E. Davis C.F. Zu L. Achari M. Pulst S.M. Alonso E. Noebels J.L. Nelson D.L. Zoghbi H.Y. Ashizawa T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA corresponding to the expanded repeat tract can be detected in the lymphoblasts from affected individuals (3Lin X. Ashizawa T. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2003; 100: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be seen whether such RNA is present in brains of patients, it is possible that RNA toxicity, a mechanism proposed for a number of other Repeat Expansion Diseases (7Jin P.

Genome Res. 2003; 100: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The repeats that are thought to produce toxic RNA all form RNA hairpins (10Napierala M. Krzyosiak W.J. J. Biol.

RNA with double-stranded character can have a wide range of biological effects, including sequestering of proteins bound by the repeat, activation of enzymes such as the RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, which can lead to apoptosis (14Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and regulation of gene expression via the RNA interference pathway (see Ref. 15Matzke M.A. Birchler J.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar for recent review). Previous work on the SCA10 repeat has focused on the DNA version of these repeats. These studies showed no evidence of the formation of hairpins (16Potaman V.N. Bissler J.J. Hashem V.I. Oussatcheva E.A. Lu L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Matsuura T. Ashizawa T. Leffak M.

Using enzymatic digestion and CD spectroscopy we have examined the behavior of the DNA repeats in more detail. In addition, using enzymatic digestion as well as CD and NMR spectroscopy, we have looked at the structures formed by the repeats in RNA. Our findings may have significance for disease pathology in this dominant cerebellar disorder. DNA and RNA Preparation—All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA) using standard phosphoamidite chemistry. SCA-F (5′-TCGAGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA(ATTCT)14-3′) contains at its 5′-end 4 bases that correspond to the 5′-overhang generated by XhoI as well as a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. SCA-R (5′-AGCTTAGAATAGAAT(AGAAT)14 AGAATTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′) has at its 5′-end 4 bases corresponding to the 5′-overhang that would be generated by HindIII digestion. These oligonucleotides were PAGE purified. For CD spectroscopy, DNA oligonucleotides containing either d(ATTCT)9 or d(AGAAT)9 were synthesized chemically and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) 1The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. purified. For both CD spectroscopy and NMR studies an RNA oligonucleotide containing r(AUUCU)9 was synthesized chemically and purified by RNase-free HPLC. Longer RNA tracts were synthesized enzymatically as follows. The oligonucleotides SCA-F and SCA-R were mixed and diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm in 1× annealing buffer (Invitrogen), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, allowed to cool slowly, ligated into pGL3-Basic cut with XhoI and HindIII, and transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. A screen of 12 clones produced 6 with inserts. These inserts fell into three size classes. One clone from each size class was sequenced. The smallest clone contained the expected number (14Yeung M.C. Liu J. Lau A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12451-12455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) of the SCA10 repeats, one contained 17 pure repeats, and the third contained 11 uninterrupted repeats followed by 7 interrupted repeats. The different products obtained could reflect problems related to cloning of imperfectly annealed repeats or to instability of the cloned repeats in vivo, a commonly observed phenomenon for repeats of this type. Templates for RNA production were linearized by digestion with HindIII. T7 RNA polymerase-driven RNA synthesis was carried out as described previously (11Handa V. Saha T. Usdin K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6243-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The RNA was then denatured in Stop buffer (98% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 90 °C for 3 min and subjected to electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The full-length transcript was excised from the gel and eluted in Stop buffer overnight at 37 °C. It was then ethanol precipitated, washed in 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 20 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Nuclease Digestion—The chemically synthesized DNA and the enzymatically synthesized RNA were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-P32]GTP according to standard procedures. For S1 nuclease treatment at 20 °C, samples were heated in 10 μl of TE for 3 min at 95 °C and then diluted into a final volume of 100 μl of standard S1 buffer containing 2 μl of SuperaseIn (Ambion, Austin, TX). 25-μl aliquots of this mixture were treated with 0, 1, 3, and 5 units of S1 nuclease for 20 min. For S1 treatment at 37 °C, samples were heated in 10 μl of TE for 3 min at 95 °C and then diluted into a final volume of 100 μl of standard S1 buffer containing 2 μl of SuperaseIn. 20-μl aliquots were digested for 20 min with 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 unit of S1. The reactions were then mixed with 180 μl of TE and extracted with phenol: chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in 8 μl of Stop buffer. For RNase V1 analysis, RNA was heated in TE for 3 min at 90 °C. RNase V1 (Ambion) digestion was carried out at 20 °C for 15 min using 25 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0, 0.01, and 0.1 units of enzyme. Reactions were terminated by addition of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in Stop buffer. The S1 nuclease and the RNase VI-treated samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min and resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The RNAs show a low level of baseline cleavage at each A residue in the repeat tract even in the absence of added enzyme. This cleavage does not increase when enzyme is added, and because the original RNA used in the reaction was purified as a single product on a gel with similar resolution, it is probably due to acid-induced depurination that occurred during sample denaturation prior to gel loading. Although it does not reflect nuclease-specific cleavage, it serves as a useful internal molecular weight marker for identifying the nuclease-specific cleavages. The bands corresponding to residues A1-A14 were assigned by reference to a sequencing ladder. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD and absorbance spectra were measured in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter on solutions in a 1-cm or 1-mm path length quartz cuvette held in a cell holder thermostatted by a Neslab RTE-111 circulating water bath. Spectra were scanned four times, from 320 to 205 nm, and averaged (speed = 50 nm/min, time constant = 1 s.). Melting curves were determined for DNA between 0 and 95 °C and for RNA between 5 and 50 °C, at 260 nm, heating at 1 degree/min. After the water bath had reached the required temperature, solutions were recooled at 1 degree/min and spectra measured after 10 min of equilibration. After baseline correction, the measured ellipticities (in millidegrees) were converted into mean residue ellipticities, using the formula [θ] = millidegrees·10·MRW/l·c·100, where MRW is mean residue weight, l the path length in cm, and c the concentration in mg/ml and divided by 3300 to give absorbance values. The melting curves were analyzed by assuming simple two-state equilibria between native and denatured states. At each temperature, T (degrees K), the equilibrium constant for unfolding was calculated as K(T) = ([θ]N -[θ] (T))/([θ] (T) -[θ]D), where [θ]N and [θ]D are the extrapolated mean residue ellipticities of the native and denatured states, respectively, and [θ](T) is the measured mean residue ellipticity. The temperature dependence of K(T) is given by K(T) = exp(-ΔH (1 - T/Tm)/(R·T)), where ΔH is the apparent enthalpy of denaturation and Tm is the melting temperature (K(T) = 1). Curve fitting was performed using the PC-MLAB program (Civilised Software, Wheaton, MD). NMR Analysis—Approximately 29 A260 units (66 nmol) of RNA were resuspended in 500 μl of H2O/D2O (90/10 v/v) buffer (containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2). NMR experiments were performed using a cryoprobe on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with pulsed-field gradient and shape pulse capabilities. Chemical shifts were referenced relative to the deuterated water peak at 4.72 ppm. The transmitter offsets were set on the water signal, which was suppressed using excitation sculpting and gradient pulse scheme as previously reported (17Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). A spectral width of 11,000 Hz was used in both f1 and f2 dimensions. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments were carried out with 250-ms mixing time and 2,048 points in t2 dimension and 512 t1 increments using the States-Haberkorn-Ruben method (18States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). All data were zero filled to typical matrix size of 4,096 × 2,048 points, and shifted squared sine-bell weighting functions were used in the final Fourier transformation. Pathological SCA10 alleles contain many hundreds of repeats. Unfortunately, repeat tracts of this size are extremely difficult to clone stably in bacteria or yeast and are far beyond the current limits of chemical synthesis. It is also extremely difficult to generate sufficient material for an analysis of this kind by amplification of the repeat from the genome of affected individuals. However, previous work on shorter versions of the repeat tracts responsible for the other Repeat Expansion Diseases has thrown light on the behavior of these repeats that has helped shape current thinking about the mechanisms of disease pathology (see Ref. 19Usdin K. Grabczyk E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 914-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and references therein). When d(ATTCT)9 is mixed with d(AGAAT)9 at 10 °C a CD spectrum is produced at low temperature that is typical of a normal B-form double helix (data not shown). On heating, the UV absorbance shows a clear thermal transition characteristic of the melting of a normal Watson-Crick base-paired duplex (Fig. 1). The transition occurs at 72 °C in 50 mm Na+, which is somewhat higher than the Tm predicted by nearest neighbor calculations (63.9 °C). Thus the duplex does not demonstrate any unusual propensity to unpair beyond what would be expected of a sequence with a similar G+C content. If the mixture of oligonucleotides is then cooled to 10 °C, the duplex reanneals normally and the thermal transition is fully reversible. However, if the temperature of annealing is dropped to 0 °C no annealing of the duplex occurs. The bottom strand of the repeat shows no sharp thermal transition over the entire thermal range tested (Fig. 1). It is thus presumably unstructured. However, UV absorbance measurements indicate that an oligonucleotide containing the sequence d(ATTCT)9 undergoes a sharp thermal transition (Fig. 1). The temperature of this transition, 6.2 °C in 50 mm Na+, is independent of strand concentration over a 9-fold range (0.021-0.19 mg/ml; data not shown), suggesting that it results from the presence of a folded (intrastrand) structure. The formation of this unimolecular structure might explain why reannealing of a mixture of the top and bottom strands does not occur when the annealing temperature drops below the Tm of the structure formed by the top strand. S1 nuclease is an enzyme with a strong cleavage preference for single-stranded regions in RNA and DNA. As might be expected from our absorbance data, digestion of an oligonucleotide containing d(ATTCT)14 with S1 nuclease at 20 °C shows no cleavage in the middle of the repeat tract that would be consistent with a hairpin (Fig. 2). There is a small amount of cleavage at the first T in each repeat. We attribute this cleavage to some sort of site preference of S1 nuclease that reflects some aspect of the backbone structure of the oligonucleotide. When RNA containing 14 AUUCU repeats is digested with S1 nuclease at 20 °C at pH 5.2, a different pattern of cleavage can be seen (Fig. 2). There is cleavage of the first U in each repeat, reminiscent of the cleavage at the first T in each repeat seen in DNA. This presumably reflects the same sort of site preference of S1 nuclease, perhaps because of some unusual conformation of this base in this sequence context. There is also a small amount of cleavage at A residues even in the absence of added enzyme. This cleavage is because of acid-induced depurination during sample preparation (see “Materials and Methods”). Finally, there is a cluster of bases in the middle of the repeat tract that is sensitive to S1 digestion. S1 hypersensitivity in the middle of the repeat tract is consistent with the formation of a hairpin. Similar results are seen with 17 repeats. Even a tract containing as few as 11 uninterrupted repeats is capable of forming a hairpin under these conditions. RNase V1, which cleaves bases that are paired or well stacked (20Lockard R.E. Kumar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5125-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), produces a periodic cleavage pattern at neutral pH that involves the 3 consecutive bases AUU (Fig. 3). Bases in the middle of the repeat tract hypersensitive to S1 are also digested by V1 nuclease. One way to reconcile this observation is if the bases in the hairpin loop are unpaired and thus vulnerable to S1 but relatively well stacked and thus also vulnerable to V1. This may not be surprising because RNA hairpin loops are frequently highly structured (21Shen L.X. Cai Z. Tinoco Jr., I. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1023-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectroscopy of r(AUUCU)9 at 5 °C shows a strong maximum at 262 nm, a small negative signal at ∼240 nm, and a significant negative peak below ∼210 nm at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4) or 5.2 (data not shown). These spectra are consistent with the presence of a highly structured RNA with a significant amount of A-form helix (22Shi P.Y. Brinton M.A. Veal J.M. Zhong Y.Y. Wilson W.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4222-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A distinct change in the CD spectrum was seen when samples were heated to temperatures above 45 °C. A significant decrease in molar ellipticity is seen with a shift in the positive peak from ∼262 to ∼275 nm, typical of an unstructured single-stranded RNA. The thermal transition was relatively sharp, monophasic, and fully reversible (Fig. 5). The Tm was independent of strand concentration over an 11-fold concentration range from 0.023 to 0.26 mg/ml (data not shown). Thus our CD data suggest that the structure formed by the SCA10 RNA is an unimolecular one (23Breslauer K.J. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 402-427Crossref Google Scholar), most likely a hairpin. At neutral pH in 50 mm NaPO4 the Tm of the structure was ∼20.3 °C. Addition of 2 mm Zn2+ or Mg2+ resulted in a Tm of 37.7 °C. At pH 5.2 addition of divalent cation had a much smaller effect with the Tm of the structure without Zn2+ being ∼35.4 °C and with Zn2+ being ∼37.7 °C. The higher Tm at pH 5.2 indicates that the hairpin is stabilized by low pH. However, our data also show that physiologically reasonable levels of divalent cation can substitute for protonation at neutral pH.Fig. 5The CD melting curves of r(AUUCU)9 at neutral and acidic pH in the presence and absence of 2 mm divalent cation. The mean residue ellipticity of the RNA was measured as a function of temperature as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For both DNA and RNA addition of salts increases the Tm by preferential binding of cations to the helical form. However, for double-stranded complexes such as acid poly(A) and acid poly(C), electrostatic interactions between the protonated bases and the negatively charged phosphates are important in stabilizing the helix. Increasing ionic strength masks these and results in decreases in Tm (24Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 1147Google Scholar). The behavior of a structure containing both neutral and protonated base pairs can be expected to reflect both of these trends. At pH 5.2, they seem to balance out, with added cations producing little change in stability. The situation at neutral pH is more complex; the protonated bases may be maintained by pairing, but being well above their intrinsic pKa, they will revert to the neutral form when the hairpin is absent. Therefore, at this pH divalent cations might be more important. The NMR spectrum of the r(AUUCU)9 oligoribonucleotide shows three low field resonances (9.8-14.0 ppm), typical of hydrogen-bonded imino protons (Fig. 6A). These resonances disappear above the Tm of the structure seen in the CD spectra and reappear when the sample is recooled. The resonance at 14.0 ppm is assigned to the imino proton of uracil in a A-U base pair, and the resonances at 9.8 and 10.8 are assigned to the two imino protons in a mismatch U-U base pair, as reported for other RNAs containing U-U mismatches (25Kierzek R. Burkard M.E. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14214-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26SantaLucia Jr., J. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8242-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Formation of a U-U base pair is evidenced by the strong nuclear Overhauser effect interaction between the two imino protons (9.8 and 10.8 ppm) (Fig. 6B). Each of the U-U imino protons also displays nuclear Overhauser effect interaction to the A-U-paired imino proton (14.0 ppm), indicating direct stacking of the U-U base pair to an adjacent A-U base pair. NMR integration data suggest that one U-U base pair is formed per every A-U base pair, and each repeat contributes bases toward the formation of 2 A-U base pairs and 2 U-U pairs. Fig. 7 shows all possible alignments of 2 strands of the r(AUUCU)9 oligoribonucleotide for both the antiparallel and parallel orientations. Only one alignment (alignment C) has equal ratios of A-U and U-U pairs. In this alignment the 2 strands are antiparallel and the hairpin (or duplex) is composed of a series of stems, each containing 2 A-U base pairs flanked by 2 U-U base pairs. The stems are separated from one another by symmetrical loops containing a mismatch C-C pair.Fig. 7Possible anti-parallel (A-E) and parallel (F-J) alignments for an RNA duplex (or hairpin) containing 9 repeats of AUUCU. The loop region for a hairpin or extension in a duplex strand is denoted by ∼∼∼. The first base in each repeat is underlined. A-U and U-U base pairs are indicated by the shaded areas. The boxed alignment (C) is the only one consistent with the NMR data showing 2 A-U base pairs and 2 U-U mismatch base pairs/repeat.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The involvement of 4 bases in each repeat in a hydrogen bond at neutral pH is at seeming odds with the V1 nuclease data: V1 shows a periodicity of cleavage at 3 consecutive bases followed by 2 residues that are much less sensitive to cleavage. However, although V1 nuclease is known to cleave base-paired or well stacked regions, not all bases in this region are always cleaved; in some cases one base in the pair is resistant to cleavage while the other is sensitive (20Lockard R.E. Kumar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5125-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our model suggests that the last U in each repeat is not a good substrate for V1 cleavage despite the fact that the base to which it is likely to be hydrogen bonded is readily cleaved. This might occur if the U-U base pairs are not symmetrical or if they cause significant distortion of the RNA helix (27Burkard M.E. Turner D.H. Tinoco Jr., I. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1999: 675-680Google Scholar). We have shown that the DNA duplex formed by the complementary strands of the SCA10 repeat has a CD spectrum typical of normal B-form DNA. It does not seem to have a particular predisposition to unpairing other than that resulting from its relatively low G+C content. Although d(AGAAT)9 from the bottom strand of the SCA10 repeat does not form a folded structure even at 0 °C, even relatively short d(ATTCT) tracts from the top strand of the SCA10 repeats form a hairpin albeit at very low temperatures. In plasmids containing SCA10 repeats, the unpaired “bubble” visible by atomic force microscopy in less highly supercoiled plasmids forms “locally condensed” or “collapsed” structures in more highly supercoiled ones (16Potaman V.N. Bissler J.J. Hashem V.I. Oussatcheva E.A. Lu L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Matsuura T. Ashizawa T. Leffak M. Benham C.J. Sinden R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because under conditions of high superhelical stress more of the repeat region would be expected to be unpaired, it may be that the collapsed structure results, at least in part, from hairpin formation by the top strand of the repeat. Formation of this hairpin would leave the complementary strand free to interact as it does with small molecule probes (16Potaman V.N. Bissler J.J. Hashem V.I. Oussatcheva E.A. Lu L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Lyubchenko Y.L. Matsuura T. Ashizawa T. Leffak M. Benham C.J. Sinden R.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 1095-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It also impedes reannealing of the complementary strands, at least at low temperatures. The stability of the SCA10 DNA hairpin is reminiscent of that reported for the GAA repeat responsible for Friedreich ataxia (28Heidenfelder B.L. Makhov A.M. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2425-2431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus our data are consistent with the idea that hairpin-forming ability is a common property of at least one strand of all disease-associated repeats (29Mitas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). However, the SCA10 and FRDA repeats are considerably less stable than the other repeats in this category. In contrast, RNA containing as few as 9 r(AUUCU) repeats forms a folded structure that can be seen even at physiological temperatures. The structure formed is a hairpin in which the stem contains a mixture of A-U and U-U base pairs in a 1:1 ratio. U-U mispairs are the third most common mismatch seen in a data base of 101 small subunit rRNAs, 218 large subunit rRNAs, and 75 group I introns (25Kierzek R. Burkard M.E. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14214-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). U-U mismatches are known to differentially affect the stability of a duplex, depending on the adjacent base pairs and the position of the mismatch in the helix (25Kierzek R. Burkard M.E. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14214-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the context of the SCA10 repeat, the U-U mismatches appear to make a positive contribution to helix stability. The SCA10 RNA helix stem is interrupted at 5-bp intervals by symmetrical internal loops, each containing a pair of Cs. Because lowering the pH increases the stability of the hairpin, it is likely that cytosine protonation contributes to hairpin stability, presumably by facilitating the formation of C-CH+ base pairs (26SantaLucia Jr., J. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8242-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although the RNA hairpins formed by this number of repeats are not as stable as, for example, the hairpins formed by a similar length of the fragile X repeats (11Handa V. Saha T. Usdin K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6243-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), full mutation SCA10 alleles have repeat tracts that are among the largest found in the Repeat Expansion Diseases. The repeat tract in affected alleles is 50 to >250 times longer than the ones we have examined here (2Matsuura T. Yamagata T. Burgess D.L. Rasmussen A. Grewal R.P. Watase K. Khajavi M. McCall A.E. Davis C.F. Zu L. Achari M. Pulst S.M. Alonso E. Noebels J.L. Nelson D.L. Zoghbi H.Y. Ashizawa T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that RNA from these alleles could form larger hairpins with increased stability. An alternative scenario can be also be envisioned: alleles with 800-4000 repeats might produce transcripts that form a tangled network of hundreds of smaller, less stable hairpins. RNA hairpins may cause disease pathology in a number of ways. By analogy with what has been suggested for the hairpins formed by the repeats responsible for myotonic dystrophy type 1 and type 2, these hairpins may affect the export of the SCA10 transcript from the nucleus or facilitate the sequestering of proteins important for splicing or other processes (10Napierala M. Krzyosiak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31079-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 13Koch K.S. Leffert H.L. J. Theor.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4439-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). They may also activate enzymes like RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR that lead to apoptosis (31Mankodi A. Teng-Umnuay P. Krym M. Henderson D. Swanson M. Thornton C.A. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 54: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or affect transcription and translation via the RNA interference pathway (11Handa V. Saha T. Usdin K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6243-6248Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hairpins, particularly those in A+T-rich regions, may also increase the likelihood of premature transcript release from the RNA polymerase complex (32Arndt K.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 79-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), leading to decreased levels of full-length transcript, or interfere with the normal secondary structure in the intron important for splicing or silencer/enhancer function (33Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10505-10514Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen which, if any, of these effects contribute to the symptoms of SCA10."
https://openalex.org/W2094026517,"Methylation of lysine 20 in histone H4 has been proven to play important roles in chromatin structure and gene regulation. SET8 is one of the methyltransferases identified to be specific for this modification. In this study, the minimal active SET domain of SET8 has been mapped to the region of amino acids 195–352. This region completely retains the same methylation activity and substrate specificity as the full-length SET8. The SET domain recognizes a stretch of specific amino acid sequence around lysine 20 of H4 for its methylation activity. Methylation assays with N terminus mutants of H4 that contain deletions and single alanine or glutamine substitutions of charged residues revealed that SET8 requires the sequence RHRK20VLRDN for methylation at lysine 20. The individual mutation of any charged residue in this sequence to alanine or glutamine abolished or greatly decreased levels of methylation of lysine 20 of H4 by SET8. Interestingly, mutation of lysine 16 to alanine, arginine, glutamine, or methionine did not affect methylation of lysine 20 by the SET domain. Mass spectrometric analysis of synthesized H4 N-terminal peptides modified by SET8 showed that SET8 selectively mono-methylates lysine 20 of H4. Taken together, our results suggested that the coordination between the amino acid sequence RHRK20VLRDN and the SET domain of SET8 determines the substrate specificity and multiplicity of methylation of lysine 20 of H4.

Chromosomal nucleosomes in eukaryotic cells consist of an octamer core of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, as well as 146 bp of DNA, which wraps around the histone core. The majority of the histone protein residues fold inside the histone core, whereas their unstructured N-terminal tails stretch outside the nucleosome (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F.

Suv4-20h1 and Suv-20h2 were then identified to be specific for tri-methylation of lysine 20 of H4 (25Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In yeast, Set9 was reported to be able to mono-, di-, and tri-methylate lysine 20 of H4 (29Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Most methyltransferases specifically methylate a certain lysine residue within either H3 or H4. However, there are also some methyltransferases that can methylate lysines at different sites. In Drosophila, Ash1 can methylate lysine residues 4 and 9 of H3, as well as lysine 20 of H4 (30Beisel C. Imhof A. Greene J. Kermmer E. Sauer F. Nature. 2002; 149: 857-862Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding all the studies on histone methyltransferases, the issue of substrate specificity, how a methyltransferase specifically recognizes a lysine residue for methylation, is not well understood and requires more investigation. The methylation states of lysine 20 of H4 have been demonstrated to be biologically significant. Tri-methylation of H4 lysine 20 is related to heterochromatin formation and gene repression (25Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). However, correlations between methylation states and the responsible enzymes have not been completely established. Although it has been reported that PR-Set7, which is very similar to SET8 in its primary sequence, is likely to be a mono-methyltransferase, fluorographic data, due to poor sensitivity, do not completely rule out the possibility that PR-Set7 can di- or tri-methylate lysine 20 of H4 (25Schotta G.

For the purpose of promoting our understanding of the substrate specificity of SET8 and to determine unambiguously the methylation states of lysine 20 of H4 catalyzed by SET8, we investigated the methylation activities of the minimal active SET domain of human SET8, which spans residues 195–352. Specifically, we investigated the ability of the SET domain, which retains the substrate specificity and full enzymatic activities of SET8, to methylate recombinantly expressed histone H4 N-terminal (H4NT) 1The abbreviations used are: H4NT, H4 N terminus or H4 N terminal; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; [3H]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; Trx, thioredoxin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. 1The abbreviations used are: H4NT, H4 N terminus or H4 N terminal; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; [3H]AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine; Trx, thioredoxin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. fusion proteins and a synthetic H4NT peptide. The products of H4NT peptide methylation were directly subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. In this study, we demonstrated that for methylation of lysine 20, the SET domain recognizes the core sequence RHRK20VLRDN within the N terminus of H4. Through mass spectrometric analysis, we provided direct evidence showing that SET8 specifically mono-methylates lysine 20 of H4. Intriguingly, we found that the mutation of lysine 16 of H4 to alanine, arginine, glutamine, or methionine did not affect the mono-methylation of lysine 20 of H4 by the SET domain of SET8. This result implies that methylation of lysine 20 of H4 by SET8 is not related to the residue lysine 16 of H4. Construction of Plasmids—PCR primers were designed to amplify the full-length SET8 gene, as well as a selection of its mutants and truncated forms, using a plasmid containing SET8 cDNA as a template. As shown in Fig. 1A, PCR products were inserted into pGex-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to express GST-tagged SET8, ΔN100SET8, ΔN145SET8, ΔN174SET8, ΔN194SET8, and ΔN204SET8. For the histone H4 N terminus (H4NT), the N-terminal deletion mutants and the single alanine, arginine, glutamine, or methionine substitution mutants shown in Figs. 2A and 3, A and C, primers were designed to generate PCR fragments for cloning into pET32h (a modified version of the pET32a vector, Novagen) or pGex-4T-1 to construct expression plasmids. All of the expression plasmids used in this study were verified by DNA sequencing.Fig. 2Methylation assay with Trx/GST-H4NT and their mutants as substrates, and ΔN194SET8 as the enzyme.

GST-tagged fusion proteins of SET8 and its mutants were expressed by incubating the bacteria at 18 °C overnight. After induction, bacterial lysates were applied to glutathione-Sepharose columns and washed thoroughly with a washing buffer containing 10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, and 100 mm NaCl, at pH 7.8. The tag-free SET8 and mutant proteins were finally cleaved off the column with thrombin. Trx- or GST-tagged H4NT and mutant proteins were expressed similarly in E. coli BL21 (DE3), except that cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h after induction. GST-tagged H4NT and H4NTD4(K16RHRK20VLRDN25) fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography as above but finally eluted with the washing buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. The His-Trx-tagged H4NT and mutant proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose affinity chromatography. After desalting, all of the H4NT and mutant fusion proteins were used as substrates in methylation assays. Methylation Assay—Methylation assays were carried out according to the protocol published previously (32Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Borchers C. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1207-1217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Free histones (containing the four natural core histones) or free histone H4 (Roche Applied Science) and Trx- or GST-tagged H4NTs and mutants were tested as substrates for methylation by SET8 and the SET domain-containing mutants. The total volume for each methylation reaction was 30 μl and contained 2 μl of [3H]AdoMet (555 GBq/mmol, 15 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The ratio between substrate and enzyme was 10:1 except where indicated. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, 6 μlof5× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer was added to each reaction mixture, and 16 μl was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE gels were soaked in EN3Hance autoradiography Enhancer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min, washed in water for 60 min, and then dried and exposed to x-ray film. The film was developed after exposure at –80 °C for 1–3 days. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Methylation Products—To characterize the composition of the SET8 methylation product, a 20-mer H4NT peptide, G11KGGAKRHRK20VLR DNIQGIT30, was synthesized. Its calculated molecular mass is 2204 Da. Non-radioactive AdoMet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) served as the donor of the methyl group in the methylation assays. The H4NT peptide was incubated with various amounts of ΔN194SET8 for 25 min or other time intervals as specified. Samples from the various methylation treatments were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis using the Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics system (Foster City, CA). For acquisition of mass spectra, 0.5-μl aliquots of samples were dispensed onto the MALDI plate followed by 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (a solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). All spectra were acquired in positive-ion reflector mode and were accumulated from 500 laser shots. Des-Arg1-bradykinin, angiotensin II, Glu1-fibrinopeptide B, and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragments 18–39 and 7–39 were used as external standards for calibration of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry spectra. The Minimal Active SET Domain of SET8 Spans Residues 195–352 and Retains Full Methylation Activity and Substrate Specificity—It has been reported that SET8 is a methyltransferase specific for methylation of lysine 20 of histone H4, which recognizes free H4NT, nucleosomal, and free histone H4 as substrates (27Feng J. Feng Q. Ketel C.S. Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Pempst P. Simon J.A. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1086-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and that its active SET domain is confined to the C-terminal portion comprising residues 175–352. To further localize and characterize the SET domain of SET8, methylation assays were performed with recombinant full-length SET8 and a series of SET domain-containing mutants, using free histone H4 as a substrate. Results indicated that amino acids 195–352 of the SET domain of SET8 retained the full activity of the wild type SET8. As shown in Fig. 1B, similar concentrations of full-length SET8, ΔN100SET8, ΔN145SET8, ΔN174SET8, and ΔN194SET8 have similar methylation activity toward histone H4. The continued N-terminal deletion of SET8 to residue 204 led to an almost complete abolition of methylation activity. As indicated in Fig. 1C, at low concentrations, SET8 and ΔN194SET8 exerted poor methylation activity toward H4. When their concentrations were increased, both SET8 and ΔN194SET8 exhibited strong activity toward free histone H4. This result suggested that the region between amino acids 195 and 352 could be regarded as the minimal active SET domain of SET8. As to substrate preference, ΔN194SET8 can only methylate histone H4, but not H3, H2A, or H2B, indicating that the minimal SET domain of SET8 retains the substrate specificity of full-length SET8 (Fig. 1D). Therefore, in the following experiments to characterize the SET8 substrate and product specificity, ΔN194SET8 was used in place of SET8 as the methyltransferase for methylation of lysine 20 of H4. The SET Domain Recognizes the Sequence Around Lysine 20 in H4NT for Methylation—To study the substrate specificity of SET8, methylation assays were conducted using recombinant Trx- or GST-tagged H4NT fusion proteins of different lengths. The compositions of the recombinant H4NT fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 2A. In H4NTD1a, the first 10 residues were removed; in H4NTD1b, residues 11–30 were deleted, including lysine 20; in H4NTD2a, residues 11–19 were deleted; in H4NTD2b, residues 1–10 and 21–30 were deleted; in H4NTD3a, residues 21–30 were deleted; in H4NTD3b, residues 1–19 were deleted; and in H4NTD4, only residues 16–25 were present. The lysine 20 methylation site was retained in all of the mutants, with the exception of H4NTD1b. ΔN194SET8 exhibited similar levels of activity toward Trx-tagged H4NT, as it did toward free histone H4 (Fig. 2B). Of the H4NT deletion mutants, only H4NTD1a could be methylated. As expected, since the SET domain can only specifically methylate lysine 20, the H4NT D1b peptide (without lysine 20) cannot be methylated. However, methylation was not observed for mutants H4NTD2a, D2b, D3a, or D3b either, in which the residues directly connected to the N-terminal or C-terminal side of lysine 20 had been deleted (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the H4NTD4, which contains only the 10 central residues, could still be methylated by ΔN194SET8 (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that sequences flanking Lys20 of H4 are involved in specific recognition by the SET domain of SET8. The Sequence RHRKVLRDN of H4NT Is Required for Lysine 20 Methylation—To further study the SET8 substrate specificity, a series of H4NT single alanine, arginine, glutamine, or methionine substitution mutants was generated for testing as substrates in methylation assays. Each of the positively or negatively charged residues within H4NT was mutated in turn (Fig. 3A). Results demonstrated that the mutation of Arg3, Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, Lys16, or Gln27 to Ala did not significantly affect methylation of lysine 20 of H4 by the SET domain. However, the mutation of either Arg17 or His18 to alanine led to a complete loss of methylation of lysine 20. Similarly, the mutation of Arg19, Arg23, or Asp24 to alanine greatly decreased levels of methylation of lysine 20 (Fig. 3B). These results confirmed that the residues within the core sequence RHRK20VLRDN of H4NT are required for recognition and methylation of lysine 20 by the SET domain of SET8. To check the relationship between lysine 16 and methylation of lysine 20 by SET8, lysine 16 was mutated to arginine, glutamine, or methionine. Also, the most important residues in the recognition sequence, Arg17, His18, and Arg19 of H4NT, were mutated to glutamine (Fig. 3C). All of these H4NT mutants were used for methylation assays by the SET domain of SET8. Highly consistent with the results from the Ala substitution mutants, mutations at lysine 16 did not lead to a significant difference to methylation of lysine 20, whereas mutation of Arg17, His18, or Arg19 abolished or greatly decreased methylation of lysine 20 by the SET domain (Fig. 3D). SET8 Specifically Mono-methylates Lysine 20 of H4 —Mass spectrometric analysis consistently showed that the SET8 protein mono-methylates lysine 20 of H4. The calculated molecular mass of the synthesized H4NT peptide is 2204 Da, and each addition of a methyl group increases the mass by 14 Da. In Fig. 4, the left column shows the mass spectra of the unmethylated H4NT peptide, as well as the products from the H4NT peptide methylation reactions catalyzed by different concentrations of ΔN194SET8. The non-methylated H4NT peptide has its main peak at 2204 (Fig. 4A), whereas the mono-methylated peptide appears at 2218. For methylation reactions containing a molar ratio of 120:1 or 40:1 of H4NT peptide to ΔN194SET8 protein, there was a very minor peak corresponding to the mono-methylation product (Fig. 4, B and C). When the relative molar concentrations of ΔN194SET8 to H4NT were increased to 12:1 or 6:1, the amounts of mono-methylated H4NT product increased to about 50% or nearly 100% (Fig. 4, D and E, respectively). However, no peaks corresponding to di- or tri-methylated forms of the H4NT peptide (at position 2232 or 2246) were observed. A similar set of results was obtained when methylation reactions using a ratio of H4NT peptide to ΔN194SET8 of 12:1 were incubated for different time periods, as shown in Fig. 4, right column. Mono-methylated H4NT could be seen in the reaction mixture after incubation for just 1 min, and the quantity of this product grew dramatically as the incubation times were increased from 5 to 25 min, to 125 min, and to overnight (Fig. 4, F–J, respectively). No further methyl group additions to the mono-methylated H4NT were observed even after prolonged incubation times. These results provided unambiguous evidence that SET8 specifically mono-methylates lysine 20 of histone H4. It was recently reported that a conserved Phe or Tyr residue of the SET domain could be the major determinant designating whether a SET domain catalyzes mono-, di-, or tri-methylation. For example, Phe281 of Neurospora DIM-5 and Phe1205 of human G9a allow these enzymes to carry out di- or tri-methylation. Mutation of this Phe residue to Tyr in DIM-5 or G9a or the natural Tyr of Set7/9 could confine these enzymes to mono- or di-methylation (33Collins R.E. Tachibana M. Tamaru H. Smith K.M. Jia D. Zhang X. Selker E.U. Shinkai Y. Xheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 5563-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test whether this applies to the SET domain of SET8, the corresponding residue, Tyr334 of SET8, was mutated to Phe or Ser for methylation assays with the synthesized H4NT peptide. Interestingly, the results of mass spectrometric analysis showed that the Y334F mutant of the SET domain of SET8 was still predominant for lysine 20 monomethylation. Only trace levels of methylation products representing di-methylation were found in the prolonged methylation assay mixture, as shown in Fig. 5, A–C. In contrast, no methylation activity was observed with the Y334S mutant of the SET domain, as shown in Fig. 5, D–F, indicating that the residue Tyr334 of the SET domain of SET8 is crucial for its methylation activity. Distinct methylation states of certain histone lysine residues, or combinations of methylation states of several lysine residues, may exert completely different physiological effects. The factors leading to specific methylation of histone lysine residues by methyltransferases appear to be complex. Different methyltransferases may recognize the same lysine site and catalyze the formation of the same methylation product, such as the human SUV39H1 and SETDB1, both of which tri-methylate lysine 9 of H3 (34Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar, 35Xchultz D.C.

Different enzymes may target the same residue but produce different methylation states, such as SET8 and PR-Set7, which mono-methylate lysine 20 of H4 (26Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K.

Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A single enzyme can also target different lysine sites for methylation, such as Ash1, which recognizes lysines 4 and 9 of H3 as well as lysine 20 of H4 (30Beisel C. Imhof A. Greene J. Kermmer E. Sauer F. Nature. 2002; 149: 857-862Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Most methyltransferases catalyze a single methylation process, such as the human SET8, which mono-methylates lysine 20 of H4. However, Set9 in yeast can methylate H4 lysine to the mono-, di-, or trimethylated forms. Thus, there are two issues relating to the methylation specificity of methyltransferases for histone lysine residues: (a) product specificity, in that one, two, or three methyl groups are added to the target lysine residues and (b) substrate specificity, which concerns the selection of lysine residue targeted for methylation.

However, little is understood regarding substrate specificity or methylation site specificity, which is of special significance, as methylation site specificity is the central consideration of the “histone code” hypothesis (2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar, 40Marmorstein R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 59-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For the histone methyltransferases identified in earlier studies, the N-terminal flanking regions of the SET domain or the pre-SET domains were thought to be important for methylation activity and to contribute to the substrate specificity. Our results demonstrated that the SET domain alone retains the full activity and substrate specificity of SET8 and that the N-terminal region of the SET8 is not involved in catalysis and substrate differentiation. This did not support the hypothesis that the pre-SET domain participates in determining substrate specificity as the SET8 does not have pre-SET and post-SET domain yet it recognizes the specific sequence within H4NT. By aligning the primary sequences and comparing tertiary structures, the SET domains of most methyltransferases can be divided into three regions: SET-N, SET-C, and SET-I (38Xiao B. Wilson J.R. Gamblin S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 40Marmorstein R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 59-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The SET-N and SET-C regions are relatively consistent in length and have patches consisting of both conserved and highly variable residues. In contrast, the residues within the SET-I regions are poorly conserved, and their lengths can range from tens to hundreds of amino acids. It has been suggested that the SET-I region determines substrate specificity, due to its variability in length and sequence (38Xiao B. Wilson J.R. Gamblin S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This argument does not appear convincing because some enzymes have dramatically different SET-I regions yet share the same substrate specificity, such as human SUV39H1 and SETDB1. Comparing the peptide sequence surrounding lysine 20 of H4 (RHRK20VLRDN) with the analogous regions surrounding lysine 4 (ARTK4QT), lysine 9 (QARK9SA), and lysine 27 (QARK27ST) of H3 and lysine 14 of the Rubisco large subunit N-terminus (VGFK14AGV), there appears to be little amino acid sequence similarity among methylation target sequences. In contrast to the other methylation regions mentioned above, the methylation target sequence of H4NT (RHRK20VLRDN) contains many more charged and large residues. Single mutation of any of the charged residues within RHRK20VLRDN either abolished or greatly reduced methylation of lysine 20 of H4 by the SET domain of SET8. This suggests that the methylation process may depend upon specific interactions between the SET domain and the amino acid residues around the target lysine. Therefore, we favor a model in which the substrate specificity and activity of the methylation process is determined by the interactions formed between the variable residues within the SET-N and SET-C regions of SET domain and the residues around the target lysine site, especially the charged residues flanking the target lysine (40Marmorstein R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 59-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Establishing the relationships between the covalent modification of histone N-terminal tail peptides and their resulting biological effects is an intriguing scientific problem, especially the subtle interplay between these modifications. It was reported that the acetylation of lysine 16 of H4 inhibits methylation of lysine 20 of H4, and there appeared to be an inverse correlation between these two modifications (26Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Werner J. Wang Y. Chuikov S. Valenzuela P. Tempst P. Steward R. Lis J.T. Allis C.D. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the mutation of lysine 16 of H4 to alanine, arginine, glutamine, and methionine did not affect the mono-methylation of lysine 20 of H4 (Fig. 3), suggesting that methylation of lysine 20 by SET8 is not directly related to the residue lysine 16 of H4NT. Although the SET domain retained the full methylation activities of SET8, it failed to stably bind to lysine 20 of H4NT in vitro (data not shown). We postulate that this is due to the “one-step” mono-methylation reaction mediated by the SET domain. This reaction could happen during the ping-pong collision of the target lysine residue and the methyl group within the SET domain-AdoMet complex. In contrast, for tri-methylation, the target lysine residue (to be tri-methylated) would have to remain tightly bound to the SET domain during the cofactor exchange. This is important because only after the first methyl group is added to the target lysine will the second and third methyl groups be added (40Marmorstein R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 59-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).

The mechanisms governing the regulation of ferritin mRNA translation are complex, but their elucidation is critical to understanding iron homeostasis.

The iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2, iso-IRPs) play a central role in regulating ferritin mRNA translation. During conditions of intracellular iron chelation with desferrioxamine (DesF) and oxidative stress, the IRPs bind with higher affinity to the conserved iron-response element (IRE) RNA stem loop 40 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the 5′ cap sites of the L- and H-ferritin mRNAs (1Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). This translational repression event prevents attachment of the small ribosome subunit to the 5′ cap sites of the L- and H-ferritin mRNAs and inhibits ferritin translation (2Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast, after iron influx the iso-IRPs are released from the 5′ cap IREs, and ferritin translation is no longer inhibited, increasing the cellular iron storage capacity (2Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 3Fillebeen C. Caltagirone A. Martelli A. Moulis J.M. Pantopoulos K. Biochem.

The IRP2 knock-out mouse, which is characterized by unregulated ferritin mRNA translation and ferritin accumulation in neurons and gut epithelial cells in a gene-dose manner, validated these observations in vivo (4LaVaute T. Smith S. Cooperman S. Iwai K. Land W. Meyron-Holtz E. Drake S.K. Miller G. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M. Switzer R. Grinberg A. Love P. Tresser N. Rouault T.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Recently zinc and cadmium were reported to interfere with the RNA binding activity of IRP-1, extending the spectrum of IRP binding modulators to these two metal elements (5Martelli A. Moulis J.M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2004; 98: 1413-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone (T3), which displaces iso-IRPs from the iso-IREs in iron-loaded cells, increases ferritin translation (6Leedman P.J. Stein A.R. Chin W.W. Rogers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Other factors also regulate ferritin expression via altered IRP-IRE interactions. These include phorbol esters, endothelial growth factor and thyrotropin-releasing hormones, each of which modulates the phosphorylation status of the iso-IRPs (7Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31609-31615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The thyrotropin-releasing hormone/endothelial growth factor-induced changes in ferritin subunit synthesis were IRP-dependent in one pituitary cell line and IRP-independent in another, suggesting that other sequences within L- and H-ferritin mRNAs contribute to translation regulation (2Thomson A.M. Rogers J.T. Leedman P.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). IRP-independent ferritin subunit synthesis is also induced in human epidermal A431 cells when they are infected with Neisseria meningitidis (8Bonnah R.A. Muckenthaler M.U. Carlson H. Minana B. Enns C.A. Hentze M.W. So M. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These data indicate that mechanisms other than the IRP-IRE interaction can modulate L- and H-ferritin mRNA translation. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) appears to control the rate of L- and H-ferritin subunit synthesis at the second stage of 43 S ribosome translation scanning, immediately upstream from the start codon before the complete 80 S ribosome translates the open reading frame into protein (9Rogers J.T.

We have shown previously that IL-1β stimulates the rate of L- and H-ferritin subunit translation in both hepatomas (11Rogers J.T. Bridges K.R. Durmowicz G.P. Glass J. Auron P.E. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14572-14578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, IL-1β induced both L- and H-ferritin mRNAs and activated their recruitment to the polyribosome from stored ribonucleoproteins (11Rogers J.T. Bridges K.R. Durmowicz G.P. Glass J. Auron P.E. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14572-14578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A distinct 63-nt G+C-rich RNA sequence 105 nt downstream from the H-ferritin mRNA IRE was found to confer 2–3-fold IL-1β-dependent enhancement of the translation of hybrid H-ferritin-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter mRNAs in human HepG2 hepatoma cells (13Rogers J.T. Andriotakis J.L. Lacroix L. Durmowicz G.P. Kasschau K.D. Bridges K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This IL-1β-dependent translation enhancement element encodes a core 25-nt consensus motif (CGCCGCGCAGCCACCGCCGCCGCCG, the acute box (AB)), homologous to sequences encoded in the 5′-UTRs of several hepatic acute phase reactant mRNAs, including α-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), α-1 antitrypsin (α1AT), and haptoglobin (14Dente L. Ciliberto G. Cortese R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 3941-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Morrone G. Ciliberto G. Oliviero. S. Arcone R. Dente L. Content J. Cortese R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12554-12558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both hepatoma and endothelial cells, a highly homologous L-ferritin AB also conferred translation enhancement to reporter mRNA (16Rogers J. Blood. 1996; 87: 2525-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third transcript containing the AB is the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP), which confers IL-1β-induced regulation of APP translation (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Based on the fact that repression of upstream IRE-dependent translation by DesF was dominant over the IL-1β-induced stimulation of ferritin translation (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we suggested previously that the AB operated to enhance the 60 S ribosome joining step of ribosome translational scanning of H-ferritin mRNA by the 43 S ribosome according to the Kozak model (10Kozak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5134-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) rather than providing an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Current models for ferritin translation only incorporate iron-dependent IRP-1 and IRP-2 binding to the 5′-UTR of H-ferritin mRNA for modulating the interaction with the incoming ribosome and translation initiation factors (12Muckenthaler M. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). There are currently no reports identifying other RNA-binding proteins that may selectively interact with the H-ferritin mRNA 5′-UTR via the AB to regulate basal ferritin translation. The poly(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) are a structurally diverse family, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K and αCP1–4 (17Makayev A.V. Liebhaber S.A. RNA. 2002; 8: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). They bind mRNA sequences that contain either a single C run (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) or stretch of C's (αCPs) via their K-homology (KH) domains (18Yeap B.B. Voon D.C. Vivian J.P. McCulloch R.K. Thomson A.M. Giles K.M. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furneaux H. Wilce M.C. Wilce J.A. Leedman P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27183-27192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The PCBPs have been implicated in regulation of mRNA stability, translation silencing (mainly through interactions with 3′-UTR sequences), and enhancement. The PCBP family members bind to each other and to other mRNA binding proteins, including AUF-1 (AU-rich element RNA-binding protein) and PABP, which are important in modulating decay of globin mRNAs (19Rodgers N. Wang Z. Kiledjian M. RNA. 2002; 8: 1526-1537PubMed Google Scholar). αCP2 regulates translation of poliovirus mRNA via a specific IRES (20Blyn L.B. Towner J.S. Semler B.L. Ehrenfeld E. J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2293-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and 15 lipoxygenase mRNA translation via a C-rich element in the 3′-UTR (17Makayev A.V. Liebhaber S.A.

Cell. 2001; 104: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Pertinent to this report, human HepG2 and Hep3B hepatoma cells are reported to contain αCP1 and αCP2 that bind 3′-UTR elements of erythropoietin and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNAs (23Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bendixen A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the structural and functional characteristics of the AB in the regulation of ferritin translation, we tested the effects of mutations of the AB element on IL-1- and iron-dependent translation in two different human liver cell lines. We found that the predicted shape and sequence of the AB element, independent of the IRE, was critical for maintaining enhanced base-line translation in addition to a IL-1β-induced increase in translation. In a time course the AB responded to IL-1β signals at the same time that endogenous ferritin was induced. Transfections using an H-ferritin promoter and 5′-UTR sequences together with either the wild-type AB or an equivalent length scrambled AB demonstrated that the AB was a novel basal and IL-1-dependent translational enhancer. Furthermore, in RNA gel-shift (RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (REMSA)) and UV cross-linking experiments we demonstrated that the H-ferritin mRNA AB cis-element interacts specifically with recombinant αCP1 and that both αCP1 and αCP2 associate with H-ferritin mRNA in vivo. These data provide evidence that the AB is an important contributor to H-ferritin expression in human liver cells, responsible for enhancing both basal and IL-1-mediated translation and also identified the PCBPs (αCP1 and αCP2) as novel H-ferritin mRNA-binding proteins that may act in a coordinate manner with the IRPs to control the overall rate of ferritin translation. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2 (ATCC HB-8065) and Hep3B (ATCC HB-8064) cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, essential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen) (7Thomson A.M.

Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 (0.5 ng/ml; Invitrogen), iron-transferrin (Fe2Tf) (10 μm), or desferrioxamine mesylate (50 μm DesF) for different time periods. Cells were washed in methionine-deficient media (RPMI 1640, Invitrogen) and then grown in the presence of 25–100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 30 min and subsequently washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Equal numbers of cells (107 cells) were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Total protein synthesis was measured by the amount of lsqb]35S]methionine incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. 20 μg of human ferritin- or α1AT-IgG was added to each sample for immunoprecipitation assay as described previously (9Rogers J.T.

After extensive washing, immunoprecipitated H- and L-ferritin and α1AT (21, 19, and 55 kDa, respectively) were separated by denaturing PAGE (15% polyacrylamide, 6 m urea, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, gels or on 15% Laemmli-SDS gels) and visualized by autofluorography with Amplify-fluorographic enhancer (Amersham Biosciences) on Kodak XAR-5 film.

All subsequent constructs were derived from H-ferritin sequences encoded by pUC-HFER, and their identity was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing to preclude the presence of artificial AUG sites upstream of the CAT initiation codon. HIRECAT contains 302 nt. A SstI-StyI fragment from pUC-HFER ligated into the unique SstI and HincII sites in the polylinker of pUC12CAT (Fig. 1C), directly in front of the CAT start codon. 5′-UTRCAT contains 363 nt.

Each transcript derives from the bona fide H-ferritin core promoter. The AB-HIRECAT and Scr-HIRE-CAT constructs were prepared by inserting annealed 63-base oligonucleotide cassettes (acute box (AB) or scrambled (Scr) sequences) into PstI-digested HIRECAT (Fig. 3C).

Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After annealing, oligos were digested and ligated into PstI-digested HIRECAT. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the correct alignment and incorporation of regulatory domains.Fig. 3The H-ferritin AB mRNA domain confers an increase in basal and IL-1β-dependent CAT reporter mRNA translation.

Transient Transfections—HepG2 and Hep3B hepatoma cells (107 cells) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of each H-ferritin 5′-UTR-derived construct and 5 μg of pRSVLuc as a control using either calcium phosphate-precipitated DNA (13Rogers J.T.

After transfection cells were passaged to equal density into 10-cm2 flasks before exposure of the cells to iron (2.5 μm Fe2Tf) and/or cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6; 1 ng/ml). Lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in 500 μl of lysis buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% Triton) followed by 3 rounds of freezing and thawing. CAT and Luciferase (Luc) Enzyme Assays—The level of CAT expression was determined in cells that had been stimulated with iron and/or IL-1β at various times. CAT assays were performed as described (13Rogers J.T. Andriotakis J.L. Lacroix L. Durmowicz G.P. Kasschau K.D. Bridges K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) on lysates from HepG2 and Hep3B transient transfections using a liquid scintillation counting assay. To validate the data, CAT assays were also performed with thin layer chromatography (13Rogers J.T. Andriotakis J.L. Lacroix L. Durmowicz G.P. Kasschau K.D. Bridges K.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and quantified using a Betagen scanner (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA). As a transfection control, each cell lysate (150 μl) was also assayed in duplicate for luciferase activity using a luminometer and luciferin (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays were also performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, cells were lysed in Roche reporter gene lysis buffer after washing in phosphate-buffered saline. Cleared lysate (200 μl) was incubated in anti-CAT microplates (37 °C, 60 min) followed by the addition of anti-CAT-digoxigenin (200 μl, 37 °C, 60 min) and anti-digoxigenin-peroxidase (200 μl, 37 °C, 60 min). Samples were analyzed by absorbance at 405 nm, where CAT concentration was determined against a known concentration CAT standard curve and normalized with respect to sample protein concentration determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Ferritin and CAT mRNA Detection by Slot-blotting and RNase Protection—Transfected HepG2 and Hep3B cells (107) were treated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml), Fe2Tf (5 μm) or DesF (100 μm), RNA extracted using the guanidinium-HCl purification method (9Rogers J.T.

RNA was applied to slots aligned on nitrocellulose membranes. A 1.635-kilobase HindIII-BamHI fragment coding for the CAT gene from pSV2CAT was random-primed-labeled (specific activity = 2 × 108 cpm/μg) and used as hybridization probes. Overnight hybridization and washing conditions of the filters was as described previously (9Rogers J.T. Leiter L.M. McPhee J. Cahill C.M. Zhan S.S. Potter H. Nilsson L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6421-6431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The CAT gene probe, which specifically hybridized to each RNA slot, was quantified by either (i) directly counting each excised slot in a scintillation counter or (ii) comparative densitometry with known denatured pSV2CAT DNA standards (0.01–1 ng) (2Thomson A.M.

Communication pathways from the respiratory chain are required to allow the cell to sense the defect and respond to it. In this work, we studied changes in gene expression induced by the treatment of yeast cells with myxothiazol, an inhibitor of the bc1 complex, an enzyme of the respiratory chain. The pattern and time-course expression of the genes resemble those of the environmental stress response, a common gene expression program induced by sudden changes in the environment. In addition, the changes were, for most of the genes, mediated through the transcription factors Msn2/4, which play a central role in the cellular response to these stresses. By using a mutant with a myxothiazol-resistant bc1 complex, we showed that the changes of expression of the majority of the genes was caused by the inhibition of the bc1 complex but that other stresses might be involved. The expression pattern of CTT1, coding for a cytoplasmic catalase, was further studied. The expression of this gene was largely dependent on Msn2/4 and the inhibition of the cytochrome bc1. Addition of oxidants of NADH was found to decrease the expression of CTT1 induced by myxothiazol treatment, suggesting that the accumulation of NADH caused by the inhibition of the respiratory chain may be involved in the signaling pathway from the mitochondria to the transcription factor.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain is the main site of oxidation of reducing equivalents and of energy production in aerobic cells, both of which are essential for metabolic pathways. Inhibition of the respiratory function is thus expected to have a severe impact on the cell and to cause re-adjustment of cellular metabolism. Herein, we report on the effect of respiratory chain dysfunction on the pattern of gene expression. We chose to study the inhibition of the respiratory chain at the level of the bc1 complex, because several mutations in this complex have been reported in human diseases and, most interestingly, this enzyme is the target of fungicides or anti-parasite drugs used in agriculture and medicine. Therefore it seemed interesting to understand the cellular events occurring upon treatment. The mitochondrial bc1 complex is a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c and couples this electron transfer to the vectorial translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The catalytic mechanism, called the Q-cycle, requires two distinct quinone-binding sites (Qo, quinol oxidation site, and Qi, quinone reduction site), which are located on opposite sides of the membrane and linked by a transmembrane electron-transfer pathway. The mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b subunit provides both the Qo and Qi pockets and the transmembrane electron pathway (via the hemes b). Qo-specific inhibitors (QoI) are used as anti-microbial agents in agriculture and medicine. A number of mutations causing or proposed to cause resistance to these inhibitors have been reported in various plant and human pathogens. One target site mutation in cytochrome b in particular, G143A, appears to play a central role in the mechanism of resistance in plant pathogen fungi (1Gisi U. Sierotzki H. Cook A. McCaffery A. Pest Manag. Sci. 2002; 58: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). When introduced in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this mutation caused a high level of resistance to Qo inhibitors such as myxothiazol, axoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and atovaquone (2Fisher N. Brown A.C. Sexton G. Cook A. Windass J. Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2264-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Fisher N. Meunier B. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutations in human cytochrome b have been reported in patients (reviewed in Ref. 4Fisher N. Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutation G290D, for instance, was proposed to be a primary cause of exercise intolerance (5Bouzidi M.F. Carrier H. Godinot C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Dumoulin R. Sagnol I. Ferlin T. Bozon D. Stepien G. Mousson B. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1996; 10: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The homologous mutation in yeast, G291D, had a clear deleterious effect. It severely impaired respiratory function and altered the assembly of the iron-sulfur protein in the bc1 complex (7Fisher N. Castleden C.K. Bourges I. Brasseur G. Dujardin G. Meunier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this work, we studied changes in gene expression induced by treatment of yeast cells with myxothiazol and by the disease mutation G291D. Exposure of yeast cells to the Qo inhibitor changed the expression of many genes. We show that these changes were in most cases mediated through the transcription factors Msn2/4, which play a central role in the cellular response to various stresses in yeast (8Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 586-597Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Yap1, involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress (9Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), also participated in the changes in gene expression after myxothiazol treatment. We addressed the question of signaling pathway from the inhibited respiratory chain to the transcription factor. Yeast Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were: W303-1B/WT (WT), CWG291D (G291D), CWG143A (G143A) (2Fisher N. Brown A.C. Sexton G. Cook A. Windass J. Meunier B. Eur. J.

Piper, University of Sheffield, UK); BY4741, BY4741 Δmsn2/4, BY4741 Δyap1 (from Euroscarf). YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% galactose, 0.8 g/liter of a complete supplement mixture (Anachem)) was used as the yeast growth medium. RNA Isolation, Target Preparation, and DNA Microarray Analysis—30 ml of YPGal media was inoculated at an A600 of 0.08. After 8 h of growth at 28 °C with shaking (mid-log phase), myxothiazol was added, and the cells were incubated from 2 min to 2 h. Cells were harvested at 1,780 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. The pellet was washed with ice-cold water and rapidly frozen in liquid N2 for storage at -80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from frozen cells resuspended in AE buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.3) by a hot phenol method (10Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar), and the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was used for quantification and purity control. RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent Technologies 2100 Bioanalyzer. mRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription (cRNA synthesis), and cRNA fragmentation were performed using methods described in the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual (11Ter Linde J.J. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2002; 19: 825-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, after an ethanol precipitation of total RNA, poly(A)+ RNA was enriched in a single round using the Qiagen Oligotex kit. Double-stranded cDNA was made from mRNA using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) and a modified oligo(dT) primer with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. After purification of the double-stranded cDNA with the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix), in vitro transcription was performed with T7 RNA polymerase and biotinylated ribonucleotides (BioArray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling kit, Enzo Diagnostics). Obtained biotinylated cRNA was then purified and subsequently fragmented with the GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Affymetrix). All microarray experiments were carried out using a complete Affymetrix GeneChip system. 15 μg of fragmented cRNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast Genome S98 arrays in a rotating hybridization oven at 45 °C for 16 h. This was followed by staining and washing on a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, and scanning on the GeneChip Scanner 3000 with autoloader. Acquisition and quantification of array images as well as primary data analysis were performed using the GeneChip Operating System software version 1.2 from Affymetrix. Microsoft Excel was used for further statistical analyses. The genomic expression profiles were made using the software Cluster and TreeView (rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Triplicates were made for WT cells without treatment (independent cell preparations), and duplicates for WT cells treated for 10 or 30 min with 8 μm myxothiazol (independent cell preparations). For each time point in WT cells, and for the G291D mutant without treatment, the -fold change was relative to the average of the expression level in WT 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild type; STRE, stress response element. cells without treatment. For WT cells after 10 or 30 min of 8 μm myxothiazol inhibition, the -fold change was calculated using the average of the expression level after treatment. For the other cell lines (BY4741, ΔMsn2/4, ΔYap1, and G143A), the -fold change was relative to the average of the expression level in respective cells without treatment. We assumed that the transcript level was significantly increased or decreased for a specific gene when its Z-score was higher than 1.96 compared with all genes designated as present by the Affymetrix software. The gene classification was made with the Yeast Genome Data base (www.yeastgenome.org). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA extraction, mRNA purification, and cDNA synthesis were carried out as described previously. Quantitative PCR was performed using CTT1 (AGAAAGAGTTCCGGAGCGTG and TCTGGTATGGAGCGGCGTAT)- and ACT1 (TTGGATTCCGGTGATGGTGT and CGATTCTCAAAATGGCGTGA)-specific primers. All real-time PCR reactions were performed in a 25-μl mixture containing 24 pg/μl of cDNA preparation, 1× SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, containing SYBR green I Dye, AmpliTaq Gold® DNA polymerase, dNTPs with dUTP, passive reference, and optimized buffer components), and 300 nm of each primer. Real-time quantitations were performed using the 7700 Sequence Detector ABI Prism (Applied Biosystems). The fluorescence threshold value was calculated using the Sequence Detector software version 1.7a. ACT1 (encoding actin) reverse transcription-PCR products were used as internal standard. All PCR reactions were in the linear range as attested by comparison to preliminary calibration experiments. The quantity of mRNA of each gene of interest in each sample, indicated by the threshold cycle (Ct), was therefore normalized by the level of ACT1 RNA: Ctgene of interest - CtACT1 = ΔCt. Relative quantification of mRNA within the cell lines examined was performed by using the ΔΔCt method (ΔCtsample - ΔCtnontreated cells = ΔΔCt; relative quantity = 2-ΔΔCt), as suggested by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was analyzed at least twice. β-Galactosidase Assay—STRE-LacZ cells were grown in YPGal media as specified for the microarray analysis. After 8 h of growth, cells were either treated or not with 8 μm myxothiazol and incubated for 10, 60, or 120 min, then cells were harvested at 1,780 × g at 4 °C for 4 min. The pellet was washed with ice-cold water, reharvested, and resuspended in ice-cold Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7), then the A600 was measured. 1 drop of 0.1% SDS and 2 drops of chloroform were added, and the mix was equilibrated at 28 °C for 15 min. o-Nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (2.2 μm) was added, and, after incubation at 28 °C for 15 min, the mix was centrifuged at 2,330 × g at room temperature for 2 min, and then the A420 and A550 of the supernatant were measured. β-Galactosidase activity was expressed in the following units: 1000 × [A420 - (1.75 × A550)]/(15 min × culture volume used in the assay in milliliters × A600). All experiments were done at least in triplicate. Myxothiazol Exposure and Genome Expression—Yeast provides a simple experimental system for testing the effect of dysfunction of the respiratory function because of its capacity for both fermentative and respiratory growth. Galactose (YP-Gal) was supplied to cultures, because this carbon source can be used either for fermentation or for respiration by yeast cells. Contrary to glucose, galactose does not induce the so-called glucose repression of the respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis. To test the effect of the bc1 complex inhibitor on growth, wild type cells (WT) were cultivated in YPGal with increasing concentrations of myxothiazol (Fig. 1). The addition of 0.1 μm myxothiazol had no effect on cell growth. A slight decrease was observed at 0.5 μm inhibitor. At 8 μm, growth was inhibited more than 2-fold. At this concentration the respiratory function was completely inhibited (not shown) but the cells were still able to grow by fermentation. By contrast, the growth of G143A, which harbors a mutation in the cytochrome b Qo domain causing high resistance to myxothiazol (2Fisher N. Brown A.C. Sexton G. Cook A. Windass J. Meunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2264-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was unaffected by the addition of 8 μm inhibitor. Changes in gene expression in the WT strain with active respiratory function, suddenly challenged with myxothiazol, were monitored. When WT cells were treated for 2–120 min with 8 μm myxothiazol, the expression of almost 900 genes was altered compared with the non-treated cells. Genes with altered expression were classified in 14 functional categories as shown in Table I (the complete set of data is available in the supplementary material). In each functional category, more overexpressed than repressed genes were generally observed, with the exception of the category “DNA structure, replication, transcription, and translation,” where the number of repressed genes was much larger than the number of overexpressed genes. Most of these 238 repressed genes are involved in transcription and translation, and many of them have previously been observed to be repressed in response to different stresses (12Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E. Jennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The repressed set includes genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, RNA polymerases I, II, and III, tRNA synthetases, proteins required for processing rRNAs, and a subset of translation initiation factors. This represents a response to sudden environmental changes associated with transient growth arrest. These changes were not observed in the mutant G291D. This mutant, harboring a disease mutation in the Qo domain of cytochrome b, contains a defective bc1 and is unable to grow by respiration (7Fisher N. Castleden C.K. Bourges I. Brasseur G. Dujardin G. Meunier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cells therefore grow only by fermentation. We analyzed gene expression in G291D relative to the untreated WT, then we compared the transcript profile obtained to the myxothiazol-treated WT. The number of genes altered in G291D was small compared with the treated WT. The repression of >200 genes involved in transcription and translation observed after exposure of WT to myxothiazol was not seen. Only three genes of the category “DNA structure, replication, transcription, and translation” were repressed in G291D (Table I). The altered gene expression may represent the adaptation of cellular metabolism of this mutant to the fermentative processes.Table INumber of genes with altered expression, induced by myxothiazol treatment or by the disease mutation G291DGene number/functional categoryRepressed genes after myxothiazol treatmentaThe WT cells were treated for 2–120 min with 8 μm myxothiazol.

The preparation of the samples and data analysis are described under “Materials and Methods” Open table in a new tab We then studied the pattern of expression change with time, the transcription factors involved in the process, and whether the initiation of the genomic response was caused exclusively by the inhibition of the bc1 complex. To exemplify the data shown in Table II, the expression pattern of genes in three functional categories is presented in Fig. 2. The genes presented in Fig. 2 are: six overexpressed genes in the category “response to oxidative stress” (CTT1, catalase T; GPX1, glutathione peroxidase; TSA2, thioredoxin peroxidase; HMX1, heme oxygenase; OXR1, oxidation resistance involved; CTA1, catalase A); seven genes in the category “electron transfer and ADP/ATP translocator” (CYC7, iso-2-cytochrome c; COX5B, cytochrome c oxidase chain Vb; CYB2, cytochrome b2; YLR327C, homolog of ATPase stabilizing factor; STF2, ATPase stabilizing factor; AAC3, ADP/ATP translocator; YJL045W, homolog of succinate dehydrogenase), and fourteen genes in the category “protein folding and modification (chaperone)” (HSP26; HSP30; HSP34; HSP42; HSP70; HSP78; HSP82; HSP104; YRO2, homolog of HSP30; SSE2, homolog of HSP70; SSA4, homolog of HSP70; STI1, heat shock protein; CPR6, binds to HSP82; and MDJ2, folding of mitochondrially synthesized proteins). The expression change of CTT1 is shown in detail in Fig. 2D.Table IIOverexpressed genes after myxothiazol exposure: activation by bc1 inhibition and by transcription factors Msn2/4 and Yap1 The gene expression in the mutants G143A (myxothiazol resistant), ΔMsn2/4 and ΔYap1 at 10 min after treatment with 8 μm myxothiazol was compared with the gene expression of the WT in the same conditions. The ratio -fold change in mutants/-fold change in WT (R) was calculated for each gene. Assignment of genes into categories utilized the cut-off values for R indicated in the Table. R1, R2, and R3 are the induction in, respectively, G143A, ΔYap1, and ΔMsn2/4 relative to WT.ActivationCategoryNumber of genesInhibition of the bc1 complexStrong (R1 ≤ 0.25)24bc1 inhibition plus other stress (0.25 < R1 < 0.75)160Other stress (0.9 ≤ R1)3Unclear (0.75 ≤ R1 < 0.9)4Yap1 and/or Msn2/4Yap1 only (R2 < 0.75; 0.9 ≤ R3)3Msn2/4 only (R3 < 0.75; 0.9 ≤ R2)115Yap1 and Msn2/4 (R2 and R3 < 0.75)49Other (R2 and R3 < 0.9)5Unclear (0.75 ≤ R2 and R3 < 0.9)19 Open table in a new tab Transient Expression Changes—The time-course response to myxothiazol treatment was monitored. The expression pattern of the genes was analyzed in WT cells treated for 2, 5, 10, 30, 60, or 120 min with 8 μm myxothiazol (Fig. 2A). The maximum overexpression of genes in WT was usually observed after 10- or 30-min treatment with myxothiazol. The analysis of the complete set of data showed that around 25% of the 446 overexpressed genes had their highest expression after 10-min treatment, and around 25% after 30 min. A similar pattern was observed for the repressed genes: 10% of these genes showed their maximum repression at 10-min treatment and 47% at 30-min treatment (data not shown). A transient change of expression was most clearly seen for CTT1 (Fig. 2D). Within 5 min of exposure to myxothiazol, the expression of CTT1 increased by 10-fold to reach 17-fold after 10 min. After 30 min, the expression decreased to a level closer to pre-stress level. This time-course response is similar to the pattern of expression induced by several environmental changes: immediately after the shift to stressful environment, cells respond with large changes in the expression of genes, and after a while the transcripts return to lower levels (13Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar). Therefore the behavior we observe might represent the first response to sudden inhibitor-induced stress, followed by re-adjustments of the cell metabolism. In the mutant G291D, with the disease mutation causing a permanent respiratory deficiency, the transcript profile was closer to the profile in WT after long treatment with the inhibitor. Induction of Gene Expression by Myxothiazol Inhibition of Cytochrome bc1—We have shown that the addition of myxothiazol induced changes in expression of many genes. We then addressed the question of the specificity of the effect observed, whether the changes were caused by the inhibition of the bc1 complex or by other stresses due to sample handling and/or the addition of the lipophilic compound myxothiazol, independently of, or in addition to, its inhibitory effect on the bc1 complex activity. We monitored the transcript changes after treatment with increasing concentration of myxothiazol and compared the data with the transcript changes observed in the myxothiazol-resistant strain G143A after myxothiazol treatment. The gene expression changes were monitored in WT cells treated for 10 min with 0.1, 0.5, or 8 μm myxothiazol, and in G143A treated for 10 min with 0.5 or 8 μm of myxothiazol. Fig. 2B shows the expression pattern of genes in the three illustrative categories described earlier. In WT cells, the -fold change for the majority of the genes increased with increasing myxothiazol concentration. In G143A, -fold changes in the presence of 0.5 or 8 μm myxothiazol were very similar, falling between the values obtained in non-treated WT and in WT inhibited with 0.1 μm myxothiazol. The mutation G143A causes resistance to high doses of myxothiazol (3Fisher N. Meunier B. Pest Manag. Sci. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore the differences in gene expression observed in G143A after exposure to myxothiazol should be due to stresses other than respiratory inhibition. In WT, low concentration of myxothiazol (0.1 μm) had no effect on growth in YPGal (Fig. 1), and its effect on gene expression profile was similar to that observed with high myxothiazol concentrations in G143A. At higher concentrations (0.5 and 8 μm) cell growth decreased and -fold changes of gene expression increased. Thus it seems that for most genes, an effect was only observed at concentrations that inhibited growth in YPGal. In Table II, the 191 genes overexpressed 10 min after addition of the inhibitory dose of myxothiazol (8 μm) were assigned to four categories depending on the stress causing the transcript change. To this end, the ratio -fold change in G143A/-fold change in WT (R1) was calculated for each gene. A R1 value of <0.25 represents a clear induction of the gene expression by bc1 complex inhibition. 24 genes fell into this category and are listed in Table III. For most of the genes (160 out of 191), the R1 value was between 0.25 and 0.75, indicating that other stresses, in addition to the inhibition of the bc1 complex, could induce the changes in gene expression. For three genes, the induction was not due to respiratory inhibition.Table IIIGenes induced by myxothiazol inhibition of the bc1 complex in WT cells Data were obtained as described in Table II. The gene expression in the myxothiazol-resistant mutants G143A at 10 min after treatment with 8 μm myxothiazol was compared with the gene expression in WT under the same conditions. The ratio -fold change in G143A/-fold change in WT (R1) was calculated for each gene. Genes whose activation was clearly due to bc1 inhibition (R1 ≤ 0.25) are listed in the table.CategoryGene nameFunctionResponse to oxidative stressCTT1Catalase TGlycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and carbohydrate storage pathwayALD3Aldehyde dehydrogenaseTKL2TransketolaseTDH1Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1HXT16Hexose permeaseTransporter and targetingPAI3Proteinase A inhibitorProtein folding and modification (chaperone)HSP26Heat shock protein 26HSP30Heat shock protein 30HSP34Heat shock protein 34Response to variable stressSIP18Involved in phospholipid bindingCellular organization and biogenesisMCS1Involved in cell wall organizationFMP45Involved in cell wall organizationSPI1Homolog to a cell wall proteinSOL46-PhosphogluconolactonaseOtherYNR073CMannitol dehydrogenase activityUnknown genesSPG4UnknownRTN2UnknownYMR206WUnknownSUE1May be required for degradation of unstable forms of cytochrome cYJL144WUnknownYIL057CUnknownFMP16UnknownYBR116CUnknownYNL195CUnknown Open table in a new tab Transcription Factors That Regulate the Changes in Gene Expression Caused by Myxothiazol Treatment—To determine the involvement of three major transcription factors, Yap1 and Msn2/4 in the myxothiazol-induced response, we monitored the genomic expression after 10-min treatment with 8 μm myxothiazol in strains with deletion of Yap1 or of Msn2/4. Yap1 is a transcription factor involved in the response to oxidative stress (9Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), whereas Msn2 and Msn4 are redundant transcription factors involved in the general stress response (8Görner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schüller C. Genes Dev. 1997; 12: 586-597Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). A double deletion ΔMSN2 ΔMSN4 was used and named ΔMSN2/4. As exemplified in Fig. 2C, for most of the genes the deletion of MSN2/4 decreased the induction by myxothiazol, whereas the changes observed in ΔYap1 were closer to the changes observed in WT. Therefore, Msn2/4, more than Yap1, seem to have a major role in the gene activation caused by myxothiazol. However, there were some exceptions, for example the deletion of YAP1 abolished the activation of the gene CTA1 by myxothiazol. This gene codes for the catalase A involved in the removal of superoxide radicals from the peroxisomal matrix. In Table II, the 191 genes overexpressed 10 min after addition of 8 μm myxothiazol were assigned to five categories"
https://openalex.org/W2083981640,"Type I gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor (GnRHR) is unique among mammalian G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in lacking a C-terminal tail, which is involved in desensitization in GPCRs. Therefore, we searched for inhibitory sites in the intracellular loops (ICLs) of the GnRHR. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the three ICLs were inserted into permeabilized αT3-1 gonadotrope cells, and GnRH-induced inositol phosphate (InsP) formation was determined. GnRH-induced InsP production was potentiated by ICL2 > ICL3 but not by the ICL1 peptides, suggesting they are acting as decoy peptides. We examined the effects of six peptides in which only one of the Ser or Thr residues was substituted with Ala or Glu. Only substitution of Ser<sup>153</sup> with Ala or Glu ablated the potentiating effect upon GnRH-induced InsP elevation. ERK activation was enhanced, and the rate of GnRH-induced InsP formation was about 6.5-fold higher in the first 10 min in COS-1 cells that were transfected with mutants of the GnRHR in which the ICL2 Ser/Thr residues (Ser<sup>151</sup>, Ser<sup>153</sup>, and Thr<sup>142</sup>) or only Ser<sup>153</sup> was mutated to Ala as compared with the wild type GnRHR. The data indicate that ICL2 harbors an inhibitory domain, such that exogenous ICL2 peptide serves as a decoy for the inhibitory site (Ser<sup>153</sup>) of the GnRHR, thus enabling further activation. GnRH does not induce receptor phosphorylation in αT3-1 cells. Because the phosphomimetic ICL2-S153E peptide did not mimic the stimulatory effect of the ICL2 peptide, the inhibitory effect of Ser<sup>153</sup> operates through a phosphorylation-independent mechanism."

The mechanisms by which the expression of this important class of enzymes is regulated are poorly understood. Here we show that the expression of the mRNA encoding the yeast aci-reductone dioxygenase ADI1 is controlled post-transcriptionally by RNase III cleavage. Cleavage occurs in a large bipartite stem loop structure present in the open reading frame region of the ADI1 mRNA. The ADI1 mRNA is up-regulated in the absence of the yeast orthologue of RNase III Rnt1p or of the 5′ → 3′ exonucleases Xrn1p and Rat1p. 3′-Extended forms of this mRNA, including a polycistronic mRNA ADI1-YMR010W mRNA, also accumulate in cells lacking Rnt1p, Xrn1p, and Rat1p or the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p, suggesting that these 3′-extended forms are subject to nuclear surveillance. We show that the ADI1 mRNA is up-regulated under heat shock conditions in a Rnt1p-independent manner. We propose that Rnt1p cleavage targets degradation of the ADI1 mRNA to prevent its expression prior to heat shock conditions and that RNA surveillance by multiple ribonucleases helps prevent accumulation of aberrant 3′-extended forms of this mRNA that arise from intrinsically inefficient 3′-processing signals.

Aci-reductone dioxygenase (ARD) 1The abbreviations used are: ARD, aci-reductone dioxygenase; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: ARD, aci-reductone dioxygenase; ORF, open reading frame. enzymes play important roles in methionine metabolism (Fig. 1). The prototype Klebsiella pneumoniae ARD enzyme catalyzes different reactions with the same substrate depending on the type of metal ion bound in its active site. With Ni2+ (ARD in Fig. 1), the enzyme catalyzes the off-pathway oxidation of aci-reductone with formation of carbon monoxide (1Dai Y. Pochapsky T.C. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6379-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the presence of Fe2+ (ARD′ in Fig. 1), it catalyzes the on-pathway oxidation to ketoacid and formate (1Dai Y. Pochapsky T.C. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6379-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the same protein can act as different enzymes, depending on the type of metal bound to its active site. The key role of this enzyme in the methionine salvage pathway is conserved from bacteria to mammals (2Wray J.W. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3147-3153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The regulation of the gene expressing ARD enzymes has important biomedical implications. One product of the off-pathway is carbon monoxide (Fig. 1), which is toxic and also a candidate for a new class of neural messengers (3Verma A. Hirsch D.J. Glatt C.E. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. Science. 1993; 259: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The other product, methyl propionate, is cytotoxic and has been implicated in pathogenicity in plants (1Dai Y. Pochapsky T.C. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6379-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, the rodent homologue of ARD, ALP1, is regulated by androgen in prostate cells and down-regulated in prostate cancer cell lines (4Oram S. Jiang F. Cai X. Haleem R. Dincer Z. Wang Z. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ALP1 also leads to prostate cell death, suggesting that ALP1 may have an important role in prostate cancer progression by regulating the death of cancerous cells (4Oram S. Jiang F. Cai X. Haleem R. Dincer Z. Wang Z. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of genes encoding ARD enzymes is therefore essential to the understanding of the metabolism of biomolecules with important biological functions and of the mechanisms of prostate cancer progression. In this study, we show that the mRNA encoding the yeast orthologue of ARD, ADI1, is subject to post-transcriptional cleavage by the yeast ribonuclease III Rnt1p. Rnt1p is a double-stranded RNA endonuclease previously involved in the processing of stable RNA precursors (5Abou Elela S. Igel H. Ares Jr., M.

We show that Rnt1p cleavage and degradation by various exonucleases control ADI1 mRNA levels and prevent the accumulation of 3′-extended forms of this mRNA. We also show that the ADI1 mRNA is induced in heat shock conditions. We propose that Rnt1p cleavage and/or degradation by exonucleases helps prevent the accumulation of ADI1 mRNA prior to heat shock conditions and that these ribonucleolytic pathways provide a mechanism to eliminate 3′-extended forms that arise from poor 3′-end processing signals present at the end of the ADI1 gene.

The YMR009W mRNA Encoding the Yeast Aci-reductone Dioxygenase Adi1p Is Expressed in a Complex Pattern and Is Up-regulated in the Absence of Yeast RNase III—We previously analyzed whole genome gene expression in cells lacking the yeast orthologues of RNase III Rnt1p by microarrays (11Lee A. Henras A.K. Chanfreau G. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 39-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Among the candidates identified through our microarray studies was the YMR009W mRNA, which was up-regulated 3-fold in cells lacking Rnt1p. The YMR009W gene encodes a protein with significant sequence similarity to the K. pneumoniae ARD and to the rodent ARD enzyme ALP1 (1Dai Y. Pochapsky T.C. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6379-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Oram S. Jiang F. Cai X. Haleem R. Dincer Z. Wang Z.

Biol. 2002; 9: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ARD enzymes are conserved between bacteria, yeast, and mammals (4Oram S. Jiang F. Cai X. Haleem R. Dincer Z. Wang Z. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The involvement of the gene product of YMR009W in methionine metabolism was demonstrated experimentally (17Subhi A.L. Diegelman P. Porter C.W. Tang B. Lu Z.J. Markham G.D. Kruger W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49868-49873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to investigate the potential regulation of this member of an important class of enzymes by Rnt1p. Because the ARD or ALP acronyms were already used, we called the gene and protein product of YMR009W ADI1 and Adi1p, respectively, for aci-reductone dioxygenase 1. To gain further insight into the potential control of the expression of Adi1p by Rnt1p, we analyzed the expression of the ADI1 mRNA in wild-type cells and in cells lacking Rnt1p (rnt1Δ) by Northern blot analysis. The ADI1 gene is located near a downstream gene, YMR010W (Fig. 2A). We first hybridized membranes containing RNAs extracted from both strains with a probe that hybridizes against the ADI1 mRNA (Fig. 2A, walk 4 probe). In addition to the most abundant band, which corresponds to the ADI1 mRNA (see below), this probe also detected three additional minor species, two of which migrated slower and one that migrated faster. Note that the faster migrating species is found in equal abundance in wild-type and rnt1Δ strains, serving as an internal control. This analysis confirmed the higher abundance of the ADI1 mRNA in RNAs extracted from the rnt1Δ cells (Fig. 2A). To further characterize these different species, we synthesized additional probes derived from PCR products of different regions of the ADI1-YMR010W loci. The walk 1 probe hybridizes upstream from the ADI1 ORF, walk 3 hybridizes within the ADI1 ORF, and walk 8 hybridizes within the intergenic ADI1-YMR010W region (Fig. 2A). In addition, we also synthesized a probe hybridizing to the YMR010W mRNA. All of these probes detected the slower migrating species, suggesting that it corresponds to an extended species containing both the ADI1 and YMR010W ORFs (Fig. 2B). The profile of RNAs detected by the walk 3 probe was similar to that of the walk 4 probe (Fig. 2B). The walk 1 probe, which hybridizes upstream from the ADI1 ORF, detected all but the faster migrating species. Note that this probe hybridizes 400 to 200 nucleotides upstream from the ADI1 ORF, suggesting that the ADI1 transcripts have an unusually long 5′-untranslated region. Hybridization with the YMR010W probe revealed the YMR010W mRNA and also detected the largest species (Fig. 2B). The faster migrating species was detected only by the walk 3 and walk 4 probes (Fig. 2B), suggesting that it does not contain much additional sequence besides the ADI1 ORF. To investigate the status of polyadenylation of species that accumulate in cells lacking Rnt1p, we purified polyadenylated RNAs using oligo(dT) affinity and compared the profiles of RNAs hybridizing to the walk 4 probe in total and poly(A) RNA samples (Fig. 2C). This experiment showed that all species that accumulate in the rnt1Δ strain are polyadenylated. The largest species was not as well enriched as other species in the poly(A)-purified RNAs. This might mean that these long species are heterogeneously polyadenylated or that they were somehow underrepresented during the poly(A) purification because of their long sizes. Although the expression of most of these forms is higher overall in the rnt1Δ strain, the same bands are observed in the wild-type strain (see Fig. 2B, walk 4 probe), suggesting that this complex pattern of expression is representative of species expressed in the wild-type strain. We further characterized these species in RNAs extracted from the rnt1Δ strain because their higher abundance made the analysis easier. We performed RNase H digestion using oligonucleotides hybridizing to different areas of the ADI1-YMR010W genomic region (Fig. 2A), followed by hybridization using three different probes. Oligo 1 hybridizes upstream from the ADI1 ORF, oligos 2 and 3 hybridize to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the ADI1 ORF, respectively, and oligos 4 and 5 hybridize to the intergenic ADI1-YMR010W region, whereas oligo 6 hybridizes to the YMR010W mRNA (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the pattern of hybridization observed in Fig. 2B, band a in Fig. 2D is clearly downshifted with oligos 2 and 6, showing that it is a long RNA species that spans the ADI1 and YMR010W ORFs. When digested with oligos 2 or 3 and probed with the walk 1 probe, bands a, b, and c (Fig. 2D) disappeared and a single small species appeared, which showed that bands a, b, and c have the same 5′-end. However, bands b and c (Fig. 2D) do not have the same 3′-end. The difference in the 3′-end of these two RNAs most likely lies in the region between oligo 3 and oligo 4, as band b (Fig. 2D) is digested with oligos 4 and 5, whereas band c is unaffected (walk 1 and walk 4 probes). In contrast, oligo 3, which hybridizes upstream from oligo 4, digests these two bands completely. In agreement with the previously described hybridization pattern (Fig. 2B), band d (Fig. 2D) is a very short RNA that contains mostly sequences of the ADI1 ORF. It is only detected by the walk 3 and walk 4 probes (which hybridize to the ADI1 ORF) and it is downshifted only when digested by oligos 2 and 3. Band e (Fig. 2D) is clearly the mRNA of YMR010W, as it is only digested by oligos 5 and 6. Overall, these results show that at least five transcripts are generated from the ADI1-YMR010W genomic region (Fig. 2E) as follows: (i) the canonical ADI1 mRNA (band c) with a rather long 5′-untranslated region; (ii) a shorter ADI1 mRNA with shorter 5′-untranslated region and 3′-end (band d); (iii) a 3′-extended ADI1 mRNA corresponding to band b that may partially extend onto the YMR010W ORF; (iv) the canonical YMR010W mRNA corresponding to band e; and (v) a dicistronic ADI1-YMR010W RNA corresponding to band a. Note that the walk 8 probe used in Fig. 2B detects a doublet of bands migrating faster than the dicistronic mRNA. Given the results of the hybridization with different probes and the RNase H mapping experiments, this doublet is likely to correspond to a mixture of bands b and e (Fig. 2, D and E), i.e. a mixture of 3′-extended ADI1 mRNAs and YMR010W mRNAs that migrate very closely. These results show that the ADI1 locus expresses a variety of transcripts and suggest that some of these transcripts arise from inefficient 3′-processing, which results in a fraction of transcripts that read through into the downstream ORF, YMR010W. A Model Transcript with Coaxially Stacked RNA Helices Present in the ADI1 mRNA Is Specifically Cleaved in Vitro by Recombinant Rnt1p—Rnt1p usually cleaves double-stranded RNAs capped by tetraloop structures with the sequence AGNN (18Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Chanfreau G. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We searched the sequence of ADI1 mRNA for features that would resemble Rnt1p cleavage sites. Analysis of the theoretical secondary structure of the YMR009W mRNA using MFold (20Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar, 21Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar) predicted the existence of two sequential stem loop structures (Fig. 3A). The first stem loop is a small hairpin containing an AGAA tetraloop (gray letters in Fig. 3A) followed by a second longer hairpin with no apparent AGNN-type tetraloop. Stems capped by AGNN-type tetraloop structures are the major determinants of Rnt1p binding and cleavage (18Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Nagel R. Ares Jr., M. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1142-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Wu H. Henras A. Chanfreau G. Feigon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8307-8312Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this bipartite structure could reconstitute an RNase III cleavage site by stacking the small AGAA-containing stem onto the longer neighboring stem (Fig. 3A). This situation would be reminiscent of some processing signals present in small nucleolar RNA precursor substrates of Rnt1p (7Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 8Lee C.Y. Lee A. Chanfreau G. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or of some substrates of bacterial RNase III (24Franch T. Thisted T. Gerdes K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26572-26578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test if this bipartite stem loop could be cleaved efficiently in vitro using recombinant Rnt1p, we generated a model substrate containing these stem loops and incubated this substrate in the presence of recombinant Rnt1p or a catalytically inactive mutant (E320K). This experiment showed that Rnt1p cleaves this substrate efficiently in vitro, whereas no significant cleavage was observed with the catalytically inactive E320K mutant (Fig. 3B). Strikingly, the major cleavage generated by the wild-type protein was mapped 9–11 bp from the base of the long stem (Fig. 3, A and B, black double arrows). When the length of the helical region of the short stem loop (4 bp) was added to this distance (9–11 bp), the cleavage site was found to be in agreement with the cleavage site selection rule of the enzyme, which normally cleaves 14–16 bp from terminal AGNN tetraloops (18Chanfreau G. Buckle M. Jacquier A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3142-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the short stem loop coaxially stacks onto the longer stem to reconstitute a continuous helix that is recognized and cleaved by Rnt1p. To further test that this bipartite RNA is a canonical target for yeast RNase III, we generated two mutant substrates. In the first substrate, the AGAA tetraloop is mutated to ACAA (Fig. 3A). This mutation strongly inhibits Rnt1p cleavage in vitro on canonical stem loop substrates (25Wu H. Yang P.K. Butcher S.E. Kang S. Chanfreau G. Feigon J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7240-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second mutant carried a deletion of the short stem loop (Fig. 3A, ΔSL), which would be predicted to inhibit Rnt1p activity if the short AGNN-type stem loop directs the catalytic site onto the second stem. As shown in Fig. 3C, both mutations strongly inhibited Rnt1p activity, demonstrated by the large fraction of uncleaved substrate remaining, whereas >80% of the wild-type substrate was cleaved. This result shows that the short stem loop is important for cleavage in the second stem, as suggested by the mapping of the location of the cleavage site in the wild-type substrate. Surprisingly, some residual cleavage activity remained in these mutants. Although most cleavage at the normal site was inhibited, some cleavage was observed at a second site that was also observed in minor amounts with the wild-type substrate (labeled by a gray double arrow in Fig. 3, A and C). In the ΔSL mutant we also observed numerous inefficient cleavages in the double-stranded region, suggesting that the AGNN short stem loop is not only required for efficient cleavage of the long stem but is also needed to dictate the specificity of cleavage within the second stem. In the absence of the short AGNN stem loop, the enzyme probably binds the double-stranded RNA with poor efficiency and cleaves it indiscriminately at multiple sites. The ADI1 mRNA Is Subject to Degradation by the Xrn1p and Rat1p Exonuclease, whereas 3′-Extended Species Are Degraded by Xrn1p, Rat1p, and Rrp6p—To further investigate the post-transcriptional regulation of the ADI1 mRNA, we analyzed its expression in strains carrying various exoribonuclease mutations. The 5′ → 3′ exonucleases Xrn1p and Rat1p have been shown to cooperate with Rnt1p in the processing or degradation of multiple RNA species (8Lee C.Y. Lee A. Chanfreau G. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Danin-Kreiselman M. Lee C.Y. Chanfreau G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Xrn1p is not essential, whereas Rat1p is encoded by an essential gene (26Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore we used a double mutant xrn1Δ rat1-1 strain (13Petfalski E. Dandekar T. Henry Y. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) in which both exonuclease activities are inactivated after a shift to 37 °C. The nuclear exosome, a complex of 3′ → 5′ exonucleases, also cooperates with Rnt1p in the processing of multiple RNAs (27Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5399-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 28van Hoof A. Lennertz P. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To investigate a potential function for the nuclear exosome in ADI1 mRNA regulation, we used a mutant strain in which the nuclear exosome component Rrp6p is absent (rrp6Δ). We studied the expression of the ADI1 mRNA by Northern blot using RNAs extracted from these strains grown at 25 °C or shifted to 37 °C to inactivate the Rat1p exonuclease. Strikingly, in the wild-type strain we observed an increase of expression of the ADI1 mRNA at 37 °C (Fig. 4), suggesting that the expression of the ADI1 gene might be regulated by heat shock conditions. The faster migrating species did not show an increased expression at 37 °C. Given that this species has a shorter 5′-end than the regular mRNA (see Fig. 2), it is likely that this species is expressed from an alternative promoter that is not controlled by heat shock. We observed a stronger accumulation of the ADI1 mRNA in the xrn1Δ rat1-1 strain than in the wild-type strain or in the individual mutant strains, suggesting that Xrn1p and Rat1p cooperate to degrade the ADI1 mRNA (Fig. 4). This increase in the level of the ADI1 mRNA was also apparent in the xrn1Δ strain at 25 °C, showing that this exonuclease plays a major role in controlling the steady-state level of this mRNA (Fig. 4). In addition, we also observed an accumulation of the dicistronic species in the xrn1Δ and xrn1Δrat1-1 strains at both 25 and 37 °C, suggesting that these exonucleases also participate in the degradation of the polycistronic species that arise from poor 3′-end processing or transcription termination of the ADI1 gene. We did not observe an induction of the ADI1 mRNA at 37 °C in the rrp6Δ strain (Fig. 4), which may be due to the fact that this strain is thermosensitive and that some indirect effect might prevent the induction of this gene at 37 °C. However, we observed a significant accumulation of dicistronic species in this strain, showing that the nuclear exosome also contributes to degradation of these species. Overall, these results show that multiple exonucleases cooperate in the degradation of normal and 3′-extended forms of the ADI1 mRNA. Because the 3′-extended forms are present in the wild-type strain but accumulate only at low levels, we speculate that these species arise from intrinsically poor 3′-processing signals present downstream from the ADI1 mRNA, which results in read-through transcripts in the downstream open reading frame. Multiple exoribonucleolytic pathways therefore contribute to the discarding of these aberrantly terminated or processed mRNAs. Effects of Heat Shock and the Short Stem Loop Deletion on the Expression of the ADI1 mRNA—The previous experiment showed that the ADI1 mRNA is up-regulated at 37 °C in the wild-type strain, suggesting that this mRNA might be induced under mild heat shock conditions. To further investigate this potential regulation, we shifted wild-type and rnt1Δ cells to different temperatures and monitored the expression of the different ADI1 transcripts (Fig. 5). This experiment confirmed the previous observation that the ADI1 mRNA is induced at 37 °C and showed that this induction is also visible after a 15-min exposure to 42 °C (Fig. 5). This result shows that the ADI1 mRNA is generally induced under heat shock conditions. This observation fits previous microarray data (29Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar). We also noticed the appearance of the polycistronic ADI1-YMR010W transcript in wild-type cells that were heat-shocked at 42 °C (Fig. 5). The level of the ADI1 mRNA also increased when the rnt1Δ strain was shifted to 37 or 42 °C, showing that the increased expression upon heat shock occurs independently from Rnt1p activity. We also studied a strain expressing an in-frame chromosomal deletion of the short stem loop in the endogenous ADI1 gene. This deletion is identical to the one studied in vitro in Fig. 3C. Strikingly, this deletion resulted in an increase of the expression of the ADI1 mRNA and of the dicistronic ADI1-YMR010W RNA at 42 °C compared with the wild-type strain, but there was no significant increase at 25 °C compared with the wild-type strain. This result shows that deletion of the short stem loop partially phenocopies the absence of Rnt1p, at least at high temperatures. The lack of phenotype observed at 25 °C should be interpreted in the light of the result showing that deletion of this short stem loop does not completely abolish cleavage in vitro and results in a loss of specificity of the enzyme, which cleaved inefficiently and indiscriminately in the long stem structure of this substrate (Fig. 3C). Thus, it is possible that the residual nonspecific cleavage activity observed with this substrate in vitro is sufficient to provide the enzyme with sufficient activity at 25 °C to cleave this RNA and prevent its expression at normal temperatures. The stronger effect observed at higher temperatures might be due to the fact that a smaller fraction of the transcripts folds into the predicted secondary structure, abolishing the residual cleavage activity. In conclusion, these data show that the short stem loop deletion partially phenocopies the absence of Rnt1p and suggests that Rnt1p cleavage may help down-regulate the expression of the ADI1 mRNA under conditions where the expression of the Adi1p enzyme is unnecessary. In addition, Rnt1p cleavage eliminates the accumulation of 3′-unprocessed species, as shown by the accumulation of 3′-extended and -dicistronic forms of the ADI1 transcripts observed both in cells lacking Rnt1p or expressing a deletion of the short stem loop structure. In this study, we show that the expression of the ADI1 gene encoding the yeast ARD enzyme is regulated post-transcriptionally by RNase III cleavage and that multiple ribonucleolytic pathways contribute to the control of the steady-state levels of this mRNA. In addition, we show that the ADI1 mRNA is induced in heat shock conditions. These results provide important advances in our understanding of the regulation of the expression of this class of enzymes. The regulation of the expression of ARD enzymes is an important biomedical problem, as the mammalian ARD gene ALP1 has been shown to be down-regulated in prostate cancer cells, and its overexpression inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation (4Oram S. Jiang F. Cai X. Haleem R. Dincer Z. Wang Z. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In yeast, the ADI1 mRNA is cleaved by Rnt1p in a bipartite structure found in the open reading frame (Fig. 3). Rnt1p cleavage is normally followed by exonuclease digestion (8Lee C.Y. Lee A. Chanfreau G. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Danin-Kreiselman M. Lee C.Y. Chanfreau G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Qu L.H. Henras A. Lu Y.J. Zhou H. Zhou W.X. Zhu Y.Q. Zhao J. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bachellerie J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1144-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In some cases, Rnt1p cleavage products can be detected when exonuclease mutants are inactivated (8Lee C.Y. Lee A. Chanfreau G. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Danin-Kreiselman M. Lee C.Y. Chanfreau G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1279-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30Qu L.H. Henras A. Lu Y.J. Zhou H. Zhou W.X. Zhu Y.Q. Zhao J. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Bachellerie J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1144-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We did not detect such cleavage products in the case of ADI1 (Fig. 4). It is possible that the overall low levels of expression of this gene makes the detection of cleavage intermediates difficult. Our results show that Rnt1p cleavage of the ADI1 mRNA serves two purposes. First, cleavage and degradation reduces steady-state levels of the ADI1 mRNA to avoid expression of the enzyme when unnecessary. Because the ADI1 mRNA is shown in this study to be highly expressed in heat shock conditions, it is likely that Rnt1p cleavage occurs at normal growth temperatures and that a strong transcriptional induction under heat shock conditions overrides the steady-state levels of cleavage by Rnt1p. In addition, Rnt1p cleavage plays a role in the surveillance of incorrectly processed species. For example, 3′-extended and dicistronic ADI1-YMR010W species accumulate in the absence of Rnt1p. These species are also observed, but at lower abundance, in wild-type strains (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the 3′-processing of this gene is intrinsically inefficient. Therefore, cells have adopted ways to eliminate RNA species that contain aberrantly processed species. Rnt1p cleavage contributes to the elimination of these aberrant species, but exoribonucleases are involved as well, because these species are observed both in 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease mutants (Fig. 4). Thus, these enzymes act as surveillance enzymes for unprocessed species. Our study provides a functional framework of the regulation of the ADI1 mRNA, where expression of the gene is prevented by ribonucleases degradation until a burst of expression occurs under heat shock conditions. This heat shock induction occurs in a mechanism that is independent from Rnt1p cleavage, because an increase of expression is also observed in cells lacking Rnt1p (Fig. 5) in heat shock conditions. Thus, it is likely that this burst of induction occurs by transcriptional induction. Because most of the ribonucleases that are involved in the surveillance of the ADI1 mRNA are nuclear (Rnt1p, Rat1p, Rrp6p), it is likely that the strong transcriptional induction is followed by a rapid export out of the nucleus, leaving most of the ADI1 transcripts unaffected by nuclear degradation. Some of these transcripts are however cleaved in heat shock conditions, as the absence of Rnt1p or the deletion of the stem loop structure increases ADI1 mRNA levels during heat shock (Fig. 5). At this point, we do not know what is the precise status of export of the ADI1 mRNA and whether its export mechanism is similar to that of heat shock mRNAs. Finally, it is interesting to consider why more Adi1p enzyme may be required in heat shock conditions. The major source of methylthioadenosine is polyamine synthesis, from which it is generated as a side product (Fig. 1); thus, if polyamines are synthesized more rapidly under heat shock conditions, then more methylthioadenosine would be generated that would need to be regenerated by the salvage pathway (Fig. 1). An additional source of methylthioadenosine is the non-enzymatic degradation of S-adenosylmethionine (31Hoffman J.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4444-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Elevated temperatures, such as a switch from 25 to 37 or 42 °C would be expected to increase the non-enzymatic rate of formation of methylthioad-enosine from S-adenosylmethionine and might also result in the need to up-regulate the salvage pathway. In either case, if the steps catalyzed by the ARD enzymes are rate-limiting in the salvage pathway, increasing the amount of ARD enzyme would respond to the increased demand for this metabolic pathway. Another possibility is that the ARD proteins, which are activated or more active during heat shock conditions, are involved in other metabolic pathway(s). Further studies on the regulation of the methionine salvage pathway and on the metabolic role(s) of ARD enzymes should answer these questions. We thank M. Danin-Kreiselman for help in the initial stage of this project, Dr. S. Clarke and members of the Chanfreau Laboratory for helpful discussions, and A. Lee and C.
