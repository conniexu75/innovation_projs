https://openalex.org/W2061946349,"We demonstrate that the recently identified DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, like DNMT1, repress transcription in a methylation-independent manner. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b repress transcription primarily through a plant homeodomain-like motif that is shared with the ATRX protein but is not present in DNMT1. Unlike DNMT1, which localizes to replication foci during S-phase in murine embryonic fibroblasts, Dnmt3a co-localizes with heterochromatin protein 1 α (HP1α) and methyl-CpG binding proteins throughout the cell cycle to late-replicating pericentromeric heterochromatin. In contrast to Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b remained diffuse in the nucleus of embryonic fibroblasts at all cell cycle stages. However, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b co-localize to these pericentromeric heterochromatin regions in murine embryonic stem cells. This finding is important to the fact that mutations in DNMT3B are found in the developmental syndrome, ICF (immunodeficiency, centromeric heterochromatin instability, and facial anomalies), which involves extensive loss of methylation from pericentromeric regions. The localization of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was unaffected in Dnmt1 null embryonic stem cells, which lose the majority of methylation at pericentromeric major satellite repeats, suggesting that these enzymes are not dependent upon preexisting methylation for their targeting. DNMT1 is then positioned to reestablish transcriptionally repressive chromatin as cells replicate, while Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b may help to establish such chromatin in late S-phase and maintain this repressive heterochromatin throughout the cell cycle in a developmentally and/or cell type manner.

This DNA modification is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts)1. Three active Dnmts (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b) are required for the establishment and maintenance of genomic methylation patterns and proper murine development (3Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R.

Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are thought to primarily methylate DNA de novowhile Dnmt1 principally maintains heritable methylation patterns during DNA replication (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar, 7Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). For this latter function, Dnmt1 has been shown to localize in the nucleus to DNA replication foci (7Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). More recently, DNMT1 was shown to possess transcriptional repression capabilities, independent of catalyzing DNA methylation, that were mediated partially through a direct interaction with the histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2, and other co-repressors (8Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat.

Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC2 was found to co-localize with DNMT1 at replication foci only during the later stages of S-phase (9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In the present work, we wanted to determine whether Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, like DNMT1, target to DNA replication foci and possess functions other than the ability to methylate DNA. We now show that, similar to DNMT1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b repress transcription independent of their methylating activities, and this repression is partially dependent upon histone deacetylase activity. However, the transcriptional repressive activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b occurs through ATRX-like PHD domains not present in DNMT1. Moreover, the localization patterns within the nucleus for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b differ markedly from DNMT1 and suggest a different role in permanently maintaining heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression throughout development. The pBind, pBind-DNMT1 (amino acids 1–1125), pBind-MeCP2, pSVKHA, pSVKFlag, pSVKHA-DNMT1 (amino acids 1–1125), pSVKFlag-DNMT1 (amino acids 1–1125), and pSVKFlag-PCNA plasmids were described previously (9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame or selected regions of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, HP1α, and MBD1 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the platinum pfx DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) from a mouse brain cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) or a human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). The polymerase chain reaction products were then TA-cloned into vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced for polymerase chain reaction errors (ABI Sequencer, The Johns Hopkins University Sequencing Facility). Dnmt3a and 3b products were then cloned in-frame into the pBind, pSVKHA, and/or pSVKFlag vectors, and the HP1α and MBD1 products were cloned in-frame into the pSVKFlag vector. RKO cells were grown in minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 µg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Life Technologies, Inc.). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% calf serum and 10 µg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Life Technologies, Inc.). J1 and Dnmt1 null embryonic stem (ES) cells were grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers in Knockout D-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 500 units/ml LIF (ESGRO, Chemicon), 20 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), and 10 µg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Life Technologies, Inc.). Cell transfections, luciferase expression assays, and confocal immunofluorescence studies were performed as previously described (9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). All three active DNA methyltransferase enzymes are composed of a C-terminal methyltransferase catalytic region that shares structural motifs with all known cytosine methyltransferases and a larger N-terminal region (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal region of Dnmt1 targets the enzyme to replication foci (7Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Oakeley E.J. Sun L. Jost J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) partially through the direct binding to PCNA (12Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) and can repress transcription by binding directly to HDAC1/2, Rb, and a novel co-repressor, DMAP1 (8Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Brehm A. Hughes-Davies L. Kouzarides T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 10Robertson K.D. Ait S.A. Yokochi T. Wade P.A. Jones P.L. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). However, the N-terminal regions of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b remain uncharacterized in regards to function. Both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b contain conserved cysteine-rich regions (Fig. 1 A) that closely resemble a PHD-like domain found in the transcriptional regulator ATRX (13Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene. 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and which are not present in DNMT1. Apart from the conserved ATRX-like regions, the remaining N-terminal portions of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are different (Fig. 1 A). We now demonstrate that these regions, like that for DNMT1, can function as transcriptional repressors. The N-terminal regions of DNMT1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (Fig. 1 A), when targeted upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter repress expression of a luciferase reporter gene, ∼80–90% (Fig. 1 B). This repression is also similar to that seen for the methyl-CpG binding protein, MeCP2, a known transcriptional repressor (Fig. 1 B). As for DNMT1 and MeCP2, the repression observed with the N-terminal portions of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is partially dependent upon HDAC activity demonstrated by partial relief of this repression by treatment with 100 nmof the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin-A for 6 h (Fig.1 B). In light of the transcriptional regulation attributed to ATRX and other PHD domain-containing proteins (14Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether the PHD-like domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were responsible for the observed repression. Indeed, we found that these ATRX-like regions were responsible for most of the transcriptional repression observed for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (Fig. 1 B). This repression was also partially relieved following treatment with trichostatin-A, indicating that the HDAC activity associated with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is mediated through these conserved ATRX-like PHD domains (Fig. 1 B). PHD domains have been found in many proteins, such as Mi-2 (15Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) and BS69 (16Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which are involved in chromatin remodeling complexes that include HDACs. It is also interesting to note that the majority of mutations that lead to the phenotype of ATRX syndrome, which includes alterations of DNA methylation, occur in the PHD-like domain of the ATRX protein (17Gibbons R.J. Bachoo S. Picketts D.J. Aftimos S. Asenbauer B. Bergoffen J. Berry S.A. Dahl N. Fryer A. Keppler K. Kurosawa K. Levin M.L. Masuno M. Neri G. Pierpont M.E. Slaney S.F. Higgs D.R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Gibbons R.J. McDowell T.L. Raman S. O'Rourke D.M. Garrick D. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Because the transcriptional repression capacities of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b seem to entail different characteristics than for DNMT1, it is important to ask whether these proteins target differentially within the nucleus for clues as to how and where they may mediate formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin. DNMT1 is localized to replication foci throughout S-phase where it maintains heritable patterns of methylation and perhaps chromatin following DNA synthesis (7Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). To further compare the properties of DNMT1 with those of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, exogenously expressed enzymes were imaged in the nuclei of mouse NIH 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts. The localization of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b within the nucleus differed dramatically from that for DNMT1. As in previous studies, PCNA and the N terminus of DNMT1 (amino acids 1–1125), while diffusely distributed in nuclei of non-S-phase cells, co-localized to foci of DNA replication that enlarged over the course of cellular S-phase (9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 12Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Dnmt3b exhibited diffuse nuclear staining in all cells examined, even S-phase cells where DNMT1 clearly localized to DNA replication foci (data not shown). In contrast to Dnmt3b, Dnmt3a localized to discrete nuclear foci (Fig.2B). Like DNMT1, this distribution of Dnmt3a within the nucleus was not dependent on the presence of the C-terminal methyltransferase catalytic portion of the enzyme because both the full-length enzyme and the N terminus alone exhibited the same staining patterns (Fig. 2; data not shown). Interestingly, the targeting of Dnmt3a to these large foci occurred in a time-dependent fashion, with many cells starting to form foci within 24 h posttransfection and the majority of cells showing discrete foci at 36 h posttransfection (data not shown). A similar time-dependent targeting did not occur for Dnmt3b, with cells continuing to show a diffuse nuclear staining up to 48 h posttransfection (data not shown). We then wanted to determine whether the Dnmt3a foci corresponded to sites of DNA replication. During early S-phase, Dnmt3a was found at separate large foci, not engaged in DNA synthesis as determined by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (data not shown) and not at the small DNA replication foci where DNMT1 and PCNA co-localize (Fig. 2, C and D). However, during late stages of S-phase when heterochromatic portions of the genome replicate (19Sadoni N. Langer S. Fauth C. Bernardi G. Cremer T. Turner B.M. Zink D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1211-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), some of the large replication foci containing DNMT1, PCNA, and DMAP1 appeared to overlap with the Dnmt3a foci (Fig. 2, E andF, and data not shown). Unlike DNMT1, however, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b did not show direct interaction with PCNA or DMAP1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Importantly, outside of S-phase when PCNA, DNMT1, and DMAP1 exhibited diffuse staining patterns, Dnmt3a continued to localize to these large nuclear structures (Fig. 2,G and H, and data not shown), which lacked evidence of active DNA synthesis determined by the absence of bromodeoxyuridine staining (data not shown). This observation that Dnmt3a co-localized with DNMT1, PCNA, and DMAP1 during later stages of S-phase suggested that these foci contained late-replicating heterochromatin. A candidate region for the above Dnmt3a structures in mouse cells is the large component of heterochromatin residing in major satellite pericentromeric DNA. To determine whether such DNA is the target for Dnmt3a, we co-expressed heterochromatin protein 1 α (HP1α), a protein known to associate with these heterochromatic regions in NIH 3T3 cells (20Murzina N. Verreault A. Laue E. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 529-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), along with Dnmt3a. HP1α is involved in maintaining proper chromatin organization and partners with other chromatin-remodeling proteins including ATRX (21McDowell T.L. Gibbons R.J. Sutherland H. O'Rourke D.M. Bickmore W.A. Pombo A. Turley H. Gatter K. Picketts D.J. Buckle V.J. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Higgs D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13983-13988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the p150 subunit of chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1) (20Murzina N. Verreault A. Laue E. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 529-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a was indeed found to co-localize with HP1α at pericentromeric heterochromatin (Fig. 3A). These pericentromeric regions are calculated to contain ∼50% of the methylated CpGs in the mouse genome (22Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). Similar to HP1α, the methyl-CpG binding transcriptional repressor proteins, MBD1 and MeCP2, have been shown to co-localize to the densely methylated regions of pericentromeric heterochromatin in somatic mouse cells and ES cells (22Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 23Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). In further support of our Dnmt3a nuclear foci representing these major satellite repeats, the protein co-localized with MBD1 and MeCP2 at these large foci in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3, B andC). In fact, MBD1 and MeCP2 co-localized to all Dnmt3a containing foci, and also overlapped with DNMT1 at the large replication foci of late S-phase (data not shown). Interestingly, MBD1 and MeCP2 fail to form discrete foci in human and monkey cells, and the explanation offered is that, in these species, the pericentromeric heterochromatin is less extensive and less densely methylated (24Hendrich B. Bird A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 249: 55-74PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, we could not visualize Dnmt3a at discrete nuclear foci in monkey Vero or Cos7 cells, whereas DNMT1 could be readily visualized at S-phase replication foci (9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). To ensure that the targeting observed for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in NIH 3T3 cells was not the result of cell immortalization, co-localization experiments were then repeated using newly established normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts. As seen in the NIH 3T3 cells, Dnmt3a co-localized with HP1α to pericentromeric heterochromatin, whereas, Dnmt3b remained diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus (data not shown). The ATRX protein, which shares the cysteine-rich PHD-like region with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, like Dnmt3a, localizes to regions of pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse cells (21McDowell T.L. Gibbons R.J. Sutherland H. O'Rourke D.M. Bickmore W.A. Pombo A. Turley H. Gatter K. Picketts D.J. Buckle V.J. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Higgs D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13983-13988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ATRX-like domain of Dnmt3a was responsible for targeting this protein to pericentromeric DNA in NIH 3T3 cells, the N terminus lacking the ATRX-like region (3a-2) was co-expressed with MeCP2. The deletion of the ATRX-like domain did not alter targeting of the N terminus, which continued to co-localize with MeCP2 at these large foci (Fig.3 D). These findings, along with the diffuse staining patterns of Dnmt3b, indicate that the ATRX-like PHD domains are primarily responsible for transcriptional repression and not the targeting of these enzymes. More importantly, these results suggest that targeting “factors” exist within the nuclei of embryonic fibroblasts that are able to specifically recognize the most non-conserved N-terminal regions between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. The failure to find Dnmt3b preferentially localizing at such heterochromatic regions may not rule out a similar function for this protein in ES cells. Dnmt3b null mice die early during embryogenesis, which suggests a critical role for this enzyme at early embryonic stages (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar). More differentiated cells, such as embryonic fibroblasts, may lack the cues to target this protein while having such machinery for Dnmt3a. To determine whether a failure for Dnmt3b to target pericentromeric heterochromatin was the result of embryonic stage, we conducted targeting experiments using murine J1 ES cells. Interestingly, in these undifferentiated cells, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3a, both targeted to heterochromatic regions with HP1α (Fig. 4, A and B). This finding indicates that undifferentiated ES cells have a nuclear environment that allows for the targeting of both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to pericentromeric heterochromatin, whereas more differentiated embryonic fibroblasts possess a nuclear environment that only allows for the targeting of Dnmt3a. To determine whether DNA methylation present at the pericentromeric heterochromatin is required for the targeting of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, we visualized these proteins in Dnmt1 null ES cells, which have extensive loss of methylation at pericentromeric, major satellite regions (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar,25Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The targeting of these enzymes did not change in the Dnmt1 null ES cells and is therefore not dependent on the density of CpG methylation within these pericentromeric regions (Fig. 4, C andD). Our data indicate that all three active mammalian Dnmts, directly repress transcription partially through the activity of an HDAC(s), independent of their methylating capacities. These enzymes differ greatly, however, in terms of the transcriptional repression domains. The majority of transcriptional repression, associated with HDAC activity, observed for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b was mediated through the ATRX-like PHD domain, which is not found in DNMT1. These findings are consistent with recent observations, which demonstrate that endogenous Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b associate with HDAC activity, that Dnmt3a represses transcription, and that Dnmt3a interacts with HDAC1 and a co-repressor RP58 through the ATRX-like PHD domain (26Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In addition we demonstrate that the three Dnmts show distinct localization differences within the nucleus and the nuclear complexes they associate with during the cell cycle, indicating very different functions for each in mammalian cells. As previously proposed, DNMT1 targets only to DNA replication foci consistent with its coupling DNA synthesis with the maintenance of DNA methylation and chromatin states (7Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar, 9Rountree M.R. Bachman K.E. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). In contrast, Dnmt3a in ES cells and in more differentiated embryonic fibroblasts and Dnmt3b in ES cells appear to target only to foci containing heterochromatin. In NIH 3T3 embryonic fibroblasts, when such chromatin is replicated late in S-phase, some structures show an overlapping pattern between DNMT1, Dnmt3a, and PCNA. However, Dnmt3a is observed at large heterochromatin structures in these cells outside of S-phase. Our findings contrast the hypothesis set forth by Fuks (26Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2536-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) that the ATRX-like PHD domain of Dnmt3a, through binding to a co-repressor, targets Dnmt3a to heterochromatin sites where genes could be repressed. Although this region may have some role in this activity, we show by using functional deletions of the N terminus of Dnmt3a that this domain is not needed for proper targeting to pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse cells. Thus, the major determinant of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b targeting lies N-terminal to the ATRX-like PHD domain, where these enzymes are most dissimilar. Our study suggests that these proteins, in conjunction with methyl-cytosine binding proteins and other heterochromatin-associated proteins with which they co-localize, may help maintain constant transcriptional repression in pericentromeric heterochromatin independent of DNA replication throughout different developmental stages. Interestingly, in terms of the above hypothesis, Dnmt3a −/− knockout mice survive embryogenesis and die only in the postnatal period, whereas Dnmt3b −/− mice die early in embryogenesis (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar). Mice lacking both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b die at earlier embryonic stages than mice lacking only Dnmt3b (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar) indicating functional interaction between these enzymes at the earliest stages of murine development. Also, the retained CpG methylation levels of C-type retroviral sequences in Dnmt1-deficient ES cells were significantly lowered following 15 days of induced differentiation (25Lei H. Oh S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of these previous findings, our data now suggest that the capacity of these enzymes to establish or maintain methylation patterns is altered during the differentiation process and that certain embryonic nuclear environments are needed to properly target Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. That neither Dnmt3a nor Dnmt3b are found at replication foci during the majority of S-phase, fits well with the fact that homozygous deletion of either of these genes in mice results in little, if any, change in cellular capacity to maintain established patterns of DNA methylation (4Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4519) Google Scholar). In contrast, such deletion of Dnmt1 results in virtually total loss of DNA methylation because the methylation maintenance role of this enzyme must be so tightly coupled in timing to DNA synthesis (3Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar). The finding of Dnmt3b at pericentromeric heterochromatin in ES cells is particularly interesting. Mutations in this gene are found in the human ICF syndrome, and cells of patients with this disease exhibit profound loss of methylation at pericentromeric repeat regions of chromosomes (5Jeanpierre M. Turleau C. Aurias A. Prieur M. Ledeist F. Fischer A. Viegas-Pequignot E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 27Tuck-Muller C.M. Narayan A. Tsien F. Smeets D.F. Sawyer J. Fiala E.S. Sohn O.S. Ehrlich M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2000; 89: 121-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeting of Dnmt3b to such regions during early stages of embryogenesis may be fundamental to proper methylation of these sites. In addition, mutations in the ATRX gene result in DNA methylation changes (16Masselink H. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As previously mentioned the ATRX protein, like Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, localizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse cells (21McDowell T.L. Gibbons R.J. Sutherland H. O'Rourke D.M. Bickmore W.A. Pombo A. Turley H. Gatter K. Picketts D.J. Buckle V.J. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Higgs D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13983-13988Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These findings may suggest a functional link between this protein, which structurally resembles chromatin-remodeling proteins, and Dnmt3a and/or Dnmt3b. Our findings now provide a rich framework for further mapping the function of the two newly defined Dnmts, 3a and 3b, not only in embryonic development but also in diseases like cancer. During tumorigenesis, aberrant patterns of DNA methylation, including gene promoter hypermethylation, play an important role. This abnormal methylation can persist in a colon cancer cell (HCT116) in which both alleles of DNMT1 have been disrupted (28Rhee I. Jair K.W. Yen R.W. Lengauer C. Herman J.G. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Baylin S.B. Schuebel K.E. Nature. 2000; 404: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Thus, it will now be important to consider whether chromatin properties, or cell cycle events, are altered in some cancer cell types such that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b might become inappropriately targeted to DNA regions that normally should not be involved with transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin formation.

Here, we show that oxidation of LDL resulted in a marked reduction in the S1P level in association with a marked accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). We therefore investigated the role of the lipoprotein-associated lipids especially S1P in the lipoprotein-induced cytoprotective or cytotoxic actions in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The viability of the cells gradually decreased in the absence of serum or growth factors in the culture medium. The addition of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) accelerated the decrease in the cell viability. LPC and 7-ketocholesterol mimicked ox-LDL actions. On the other hand, HDL and LDL almost completely reversed the serum deprivation- or ox-LDL-induced cytotoxicity. Exogenous S1P mimicked cytoprotective actions. Moreover, the S1P-rich fraction and chromatographically purified S1P from HDL exerted cytoprotective actions, but the rest of the fractions did not. The cytoprotective actions of HDL and S1P were associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and were almost completely inhibited by pertussis toxin and PD98059, an ERK kinase inhibitor. The HDL-induced action was specifically desensitized in the S1P-pretreated cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the lipoprotein-associated S1P and the lipid receptor-mediated signal pathways may be responsible for the lipoprotein-induced cytoprotective actions. Furthermore, the decrease in the S1P content, in addition to the accumulation of cytotoxic substances such as LPC, may be important for the acquisition of the cytotoxic property to ox-LDL.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)1 provides cholesterol to cells through LDL receptors, and this lipoprotein is thought to play an important role in atherosclerosis after undergoing oxidative modifications (1Ross R.

Thus, ox-LDL is present in atherosclerotic lesions and exerts a variety of biological actions, including cytotoxicity on the cells of the artery wall, potentially involved in atherogenesis (1Ross R.

Recent studies show that LPC mimics some of ox-LDL-induced actions (5Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HDL levels have been shown to be inversely correlated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9957) Google Scholar, 2Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 3Diaz M.N. Frei B. Vita J.A.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the anti-atherogenic functions of HDL. These include the promotion of the efflux of cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaques, inhibition of the oxidative modification of LDL, and inhibition of the expression of adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) (1Ross R.

S1P, one of the sphingolipid metabolites, has been shown to participate in a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, motility, and apoptosis (11Spiegel S.

These cellular responses elicited by S1P were first thought to be mediated through an intracellular target(s), but extracellular mechanisms through G-protein-coupled S1P receptors have also been suggested. Supporting the latter extracellular mechanisms, several isoforms of S1P receptors have been identified (11Spiegel S. Merrill A.H.J.

These S1P receptor subtypes are expressed and functioning in a variety of cells including endothelial cells. In vascular endothelial cells, S1P has been shown to regulate a wide range of cellular activities involved in angiogenesis, wound healing, apoptosis, and atherosclerosis (17Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R.

Gouni-Berthold I. Schmitz U. Seul C. Ko Y. Vetter H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, we specified one of the S1P-like lipids as S1P (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We also succeeded in quantifying the S1P content in plasma components: this lipid was concentrated per unit amount of protein in lipoprotein fractions with the rank order of HDL>LDL = VLDL>lipoprotein-deficient plasma (albumin fraction) (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that S1P mediates some of the lipoprotein-induced actions in endothelial cells. In the present study, we show that S1P may mediate the lipoprotein-induced cytoprotective actions through S1P receptors and their intracellular signaling pathways. We also found that oxidation of LDL markedly reduced its S1P content in association with a marked increase in cytotoxic LPC content. Thus, plasma lipoprotein-associated S1P may be an important factor for determining whether these actions are cytoprotective or cytotoxic. S1P was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co., and 1-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid; LPA), 7-ketocholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 1-palmitoyl (C16:0) lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and other lipids were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. A p44/p42 MAP kinase (ERK1/2) enzyme assay kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotechand an ERK-specific antibody (K-23, amino acids 305–327 of rat ERK1, which recognizes both ERK1 and ERK2) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasma lipoproteins were prepared by density gradient centrifugation; LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) and HDL (1.063–1.21 g/ml) were separated from freshly isolated human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Human plasma was collected from normal healthy volunteers. ox-LDL was prepared by oxidizing for 20 h with 10 µm CuSO4 after extensive dialysis against 150 µm NaCl/PBS (9:1) (5Quinn M.T.

HUVECs with passages of 3 were purchased from Whittaker Bioproducts (Walkersville, MD).

In the experiments with PD98059 (10 µm) or SB203580 (1 µm), the cells were pretreated with these inhibitors for 1 h and then cultured for another 24 h with test agents in the presence of these inhibitors. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and harvested with trypsin. The viable cells were determined by trypan blue (0.2%) exclusion assay. The results were expressed as percentages of the value obtained with 15% FBS in the control cells. HUVECs were incubated for 4 h in fresh RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA unless otherwise noted.

For the desensitization experiments with S1P (Fig. 5), the cells were incubated for another 5 h with or without S1P (1 µm) after the 4 h-culture with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA. After the S1P pretreatment procedure, the cells were preincubated for 20 min in HEPES-buffered medium and incubated for 5 min with the test agents as described above.

The kinase activity was determined with an assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that measures the incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into a synthetic peptide (KRELVEPLTPAGEAPNQALLR) as a specific substrate. The enzyme activity was expressed as percentages of the basal activity without test agents in control cells. The same lysate was also analyzed by Western blotting with an ERK-specific antibody to detect the change in gel mobility reflecting phosphorylation of the enzyme as described previously (24Sato K.

HDL (about 4 mg in 2 ml) was extensively mixed with chloroform (3 ml), methanol (2 ml), water (0.5 ml), and 10 N NaOH (0.1 ml), and the phases were separated. The upper alkaline phase was collected. To the lower phase, 4 ml of synthetic upper phase mixture was added, and the phases were separated again. The lower phase containing the majority of phospholipids and neutral lipids evaporated to dryness (fraction a). The pooled upper alkaline phase containing S1P (about 8 ml), chloroform (4 ml) and HCl (0.2 ml) were mixed extensively and the phases were separated. The lower chloroform phase was collected. This extraction procedure was repeated another four times more by adding chloroform (4 ml) to the upper aqueous solution and phase separation. The pooled chloroform phase (about 20 ml) containing S1P was evaporated to dryness (fraction b). S1P recovery was about 90% as determined by including [3H]S1P as an internal standard in the lipid purification procedure. The upper aqueous phase containing water-soluble substances was also dried by evaporation (fraction c). Fraction b was further processed by a silica gel high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) (Merck) using a solvent system consisting of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1). The silica gel with the resolved lipids (about 1-cm length each) was scraped off to obtain lipids covering the entire area of migration. The lipids were then eluted with chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:1) and dried by evaporation. All fractions thus separated were dissolved in PBS containing 0.4% BSA (2 ml) and were used at a final concentration of 10%. The total lipids were extracted from lipoproteins as described for fraction a in the previous section except that 1 N HCl was used instead of 10 N NaOH. LPC was then separated by an HPTLC using a solvent system consisting of chloroform, methanol, 20% NH4OH (60:35:8). The bands were stained with primulin and visualized under UV light. The LPC fraction was scraped, and the lipid content was quantified with the malachite green method (25Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Agarose gel film, TITAN GEL LIPO KIT J3045 (Helena Laboratories, Japan), was used. After electrophoresis, the film was dried and thereafter stained with Fat Red 7B. Other experimental conditions are described in the previous study (26Kawakami K. Tsukada A. Okubo M. Tsukada T. Kobayashi T. Yamada N. Murase T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1989; 185: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). S1P in plasma lipoproteins was selectively extracted, and its content was measured by a radioreceptor binding assay using Edg-1-expressing CHO cells as described previously (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 23Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This was performed as described previously (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In brief, vector- or Edg-3-transfected CHO cells, which had been labeled with [3H]inositol, were harvested from 10-cm dishes with trypsin, washed by sedimentation (250 ×g for 5 min) and resuspended in HEPES-buffered medium. The cells were then incubated to measure the production of3H-labeled IP2 and IP3. To normalize the effects of lipoproteins in vector-transfected or Edg-3-transfected cells, data were first normalized to 105dpm of the total radioactivity incorporated into the cellular inositol lipids in each experiment, and then the results were expressed as percentages of the maximal activity obtained at 1 µm S1P in Edg-3-transfected cells. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate. The results of multiple observations were presented as means ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test. In Fig.1A, we measured the S1P content in the lipoprotein particles of human plasma by a radioreceptor binding assay, which we recently established (23Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Okajima F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For this quantitative measurement, S1P was extracted from lipoproteins. Consistent with the previous result (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), S1P contents in LDL and HDL reached ∼100–200 pmol/mg protein, respectively, which are 20–40 times higher than the S1P content in the lipoprotein-deficient plasma (22Murata N. Sato K. Kon J. Tomura H. Yanagita M. Kuwabara A. Ui M. Okajima F. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Because oxidation of LDL is thought to be a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, we examined the effect of oxidation on the S1P content in LDL. The CuSO4 treatment of LDL induced degradation of Apo B (Fig. 1 B). The copper treatment also induced a marked accumulation of LPC at an expense of reduction of phosphatidylcholine (Fig. 1 C) (5Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2805-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 6Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9741-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the S1P content was reduced to about 25% of the initial value (Fig. 1 A). To examine whether the change in the S1P content is reflected in the functional activity, we measured S1P receptor-mediated phospholipase C-stimulating activity by the intact lipoprotein samples without the extraction procedure of S1P. In the vector-transfected CHO cells, inositol phosphate production in response to lipoproteins regardless of the lipoprotein species was very small (Fig. 1 D, upper panel). On the other hand, in the S1P receptor Edg-3-overexpressing CHO cells, HDL and LDL markedly stimulated inositol phosphate production reflecting activation of phospholipase C, whereas ox-LDL exerted only a small effect on the activity (Fig.1 D, lower panel). It is reasonable to assume that the increase in the activity induced by the receptor transfection may be mediated by the S1P receptor. Thus, the change in the S1P content in lipoprotein particles seems to reflect their ability to stimulate the S1P receptor. When HUVECs were cultured without serum or growth factors, the cells gradually lost their viability and were detached from the dishes. At 24 h after serum deprivation, only 50% of the cells had survived (Fig.2A). Under these conditions, both HDL and LDL at 100 µg/ml almost completely reversed the serum deprivation-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 A). On the contrary, ox-LDL accelerated the cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the oxidative lipids, including 7-ketocholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and LPC, which were accumulated during LDL oxidation (5Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc.

The cytotoxicity induced by these agents including ox-LDL was reversed by HDL (Fig. 2 B). LDL was also effective for inhibiting the ox-LDL-induced action (Fig. 2 C). S1P has been shown to protect HUVECs from cytotoxicity or apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (18Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N. Liu C.H. Kluk M. Volpi M. Sha'afi R.I. Hla T.

We confirmed this observation (Fig. 2 D). Furthermore, we found that S1P also inhibited the ox-LDL-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 D). Thus, S1P mimicked cytoprotective action of HDL or LDL. LPA has also been shown to regulate the variety of functions of HUVECs (29Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), but this lipid was ineffective for cytoprotection of HUVECs at concentrations less than 10 µm and exerted a rather cytotoxic effect at higher concentrations (data not shown). We also examined the effects of other lipids including platelet-activating factor, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine, but we could not detect any significant cytoprotective effect at concentrations lower than 10 µm (data not shown). We next examined the signaling pathways involved in the S1P and HDL-induced cytoprotective actions. For this, we used PTX, an inhibitor for Gi/Go protein functions; PD98059, an inhibitor for ERK kinase (MEK); and SB203580, an inhibitor for p38 MAP kinase. Any drug treatment minimally affected the viability of the cells in the presence of serum (Fig.3A). Among these agents, a prior treatment of the cells with PTX or PD98059, but not SB203580, almost completely inhibited S1P- or HDL-induced cytoprotective actions against the cytotoxicity induced by serum deprivation and ox-LDL (Fig.3 B). When LDL was used instead of HDL, we observed a similar cytoprotective action that was sensitive to both PTX and PD98059 (data not shown). These results suggest involvement of Gi/Goproteins and ERK in the S1P- and HDL-induce"

The reactions associated with reversible binding of oxygen and other ligands to Hbs have served as the basis for developing methods and models still in use today by investigators interested in the dynamics of protein-ligand interactions (1Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 2Austin R. Beeson K. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Gunsalus C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17593-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Yet, despite a history of extensive study, current research is revealing aspects of this venerable protein family that necessitate reevaluation of the old Hb paradigms, from biophysical and physiological perspectives alike. Hbs are generally described as proteins that bind heme b(iron protoporphyrin IX) using a highly conserved α-helical “globin” fold. The iron atom in a Hb heme prosthetic group normally exists in either the ferrous (Fe2+) or ferric (Fe3+) redox state and has octahedral coordination geometry with six potential binding sites. Heme pyrrole nitrogens occupy the four equatorial binding sites, and one of the axial sites is coordinated by a His side chain that is invariant in all known Hbs. This “proximal” coordinate-covalent bond stabilizes the protein structure by slowing heme dissociation and concomitantly influences the reactivity of the heme iron on the “distal” side. Binding of the proximal His residue leaves one remaining axial coordination site on the distal side of the heme available for ligand binding. The occupation of this binding site is commonly described using the terms “pentacoordinate” and “hexacoordinate”; if the distal site is empty, the heme iron has five of six binding sites occupied and is therefore pentacoordinate. The most familiar examples of Hbs are the two vertebrate globins found in humans and other mammals. Human “hemoglobin” is a tetramer of Hb domains found in red blood cells, where it transports oxygen from the lungs to other tissues. Human myoglobin is a monomeric Hb that stores oxygen in muscle tissue and facilitates its diffusion from the red blood cells to mitochondria for use in oxidative phosphorylation (4Merx M. Flogel U. Stumpe T. Godecke A. Decking U. Schrader J. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins use a combination of mechanisms to regulate their oxygen binding and dissociation rate constants. This creates affinity levels that are appropriate for transport under the differing physiological conditions within which each protein functions. One of these mechanisms involves a change in the strain on the bond joining the proximal His and heme iron upon oxygen binding. This change alters the reactivity of the heme iron and forms the root of allostery in human hemoglobin (5Barrick D. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Dahlquist F.W. Ho C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Perutz M. Wilkinson A. Paoli M. Dodson G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The volume and electrostatic properties of the distal heme pocket also modulate ligand specificity and binding affinity (3Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17593-17596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 7Olson J.S. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 544-552Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In combination with a variety of quaternary structural arrangements and other subtle variations of the globin structure, these mechanisms produce the wide range of oxygen affinities observed in Hbs from various organisms (8Bolognesi M. Bordo D. Rizzi M. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1997; 68: 29-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Royer W. Knapp J. Strand K. Heaslet H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 297-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, among these variations, a pentacoordinate heme iron in the deoxygenated state was held to be a common characteristic because of the perceived need for an unhindered binding site for rapid ligand association and stabilization. Recent studies are forcing a reevaluation of this perception. The last several years have seen a large number of new heme proteins discovered in a range of organisms representing all kingdoms of life (10Couture M. Das T.K. Lee H.C. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L.

Homo sapiens recently joined this growing list of organisms with the identification of a third human hemoglobin termed “neuroglobin” (NHb) because of its predominate expression in the brain (16Burmester T. Welch B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Early biophysical study of these new proteins revealed surprising results; some of the Hbs formed reversible, intramolecular hexacoordinate complexes (10Couture M. Das T.K. Lee H.C. Peisach J.

Instead of the simple bimolecular reactions observed with traditional pentacoordinate Hbs, ligand binding to hexacoordinate Hbs involves a competition between the exogenous ligand and intramolecular coordination by a local amino acid side chain (19Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The potential for significant modulation of kinetic behavior and a common occurrence among recently discovered Hbs and other heme proteins suggest that hexacoordination is a new mechanism for regulating ligand binding to heme proteins. Biophysical properties of hexacoordinate hemoglobins (hxHbs) from organisms representing three of the kingdoms have thus far been investigated. The presence of hxHbs appears ubiquitous in plants (the “non-symbiotic Hbs” or nsHbs), with most species containing two or three different nsHbs that each display unique expression patterns (20Arredondo-Peter R. Hargrove M.S. Moran J.F. Sarath G. Klucas R.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,21Trevaskis B. Watts R.A. Andersson C.R. Llewellyn D.J. Hargrove M.S.

The cyanobacterium Synechocystis contains a hxHb that is also a member of the “truncated” family of hemoglobins (17Couture M. Das T. Savard P. Ouellet Y. Wittenberg J. Wittenberg B. Rousseau D. Guertin M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4770-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 2Hvitved, A. N., Trent, J. T., III, Premer, S. A., and Hargrove, M. S. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., in press. Truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) are the smallest members of the Hb family, with an abbreviation of the classic globin fold and average molecular sizes under 14 kDa (22Pesce A. Couture M. Dewilde S. Guertin M. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Moens L. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An algal hxHb with considerable homology to the trHbs has also been identified in Chlamydomonas (23Couture M. Yeh S. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl.

The precedents set by earlier discoveries of hxHbs, coupled with minimal primary sequence homology to vertebrate globins and suggestive absorbance spectra from mouse neuroglobin (16Burmester T. Welch B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), evoked the possibility that NHb might be a human hxHb. This paper describes our exploration of that possibility through the investigation of coordination character and ligand binding behavior in NHb. Online data bases (GenBankTM, IMAGE consortium, Incyte Lifesequence Gold) were screened for EST sequences corresponding to the published DNA sequence for human neuroglobin (GenBankTM accession number AJ245944). An EST clone (ID 3973744) from Incyte Genomics contained the most complete copy of NHb, having base pairs 41–456 of the gene cDNA. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to add base pairs 1–40 and to incorporate NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ end of the gene, respectively. The complete NHb cDNA was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using these primers and then cloned into the expression vector pET29a (Novagen) for recombinant protein generation. Human NHb was expressed by the host strain Escherichia coliBL21(λDE3) CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene) in a fermentation apparatus described previously (27Trent III., J.T. Hvitved A.N. Hargrove M.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6155-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression medium consisted of 20 liters of Terrific Broth supplemented with 50 µg/ml kanamycin, 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol, 3 µg/ml hemin chloride (solubilized in 0.1m NaOH and added post-induction), and 0.5 ml antifoam (Sigma). The expression strain containing neuroglobin was cultured at 37 °C to an optical density of 1.7 at 600 nm, and then expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG, Sigma) to a final concentration of 400 µm. Protein expression was allowed to continue for 6 h, whereupon the culture was harvested through formation of a cell pellet by centrifugation (∼ 5000 ×g for 10 min). Following cell lysis, neuroglobin was purified in a four-stage process involving ammonium sulfate fractionation (20 and 60%), phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography (1.25 m(NH4)2SO4 binding, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4 elution), DEAE-cellulose column chromatography (the protein was bound in the absence of NaCl and eluted in 100 mm NaCl), and a final size exclusion chromatography step (Sephacryl S-200). The protein solution was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) after the phenyl-Sepharose separation and before the DEAE-cellulose purification step. A protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was included in all purification buffers except that used in the final size exclusion chromatography step. The protein was maintained at 4 °C throughout purification. Protein purification was monitored with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and spectroscopic analysis of Soret/280 nm ratios. Absorbance spectra were collected with a Varian Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer. The protein sample buffer consisted of 100 mm potassium phosphate at 20 °C and a pH of 7.0 unless otherwise specified. Reduced protein spectra were obtained in N2 sparged sample buffer following reduction of the protein with sodium dithionite. Rapid mixing experiments were conducted with a Durrum stopped flow apparatus and OLIS data collection software using previously described methods (28Goodman M.D. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6834-6839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Olson J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oxygen dissociation rate constants were measured using the ligand displacement reaction by mixing oxygenated samples with carbon monoxide. Direct observation of oxygen dissociation rate constants by mixing oxygenated samples with solutions of carbon monoxide and sodium dithionite produced values equivalent to those calculated using the ligand displacement reaction. The flash photolysis apparatus and the methods used to assess hexacoordination and bimolecular CO association rate constants have been described previously (19Hargrove M. Biophys.

By varying the ratio of N2 and O2 with gas flow tubes, a stream of the desired [O2] was generated. This gas stream was used to equilibrate the buffer reservoir of a small Sephadex G-25 desalting column. A few grains of sodium dithionite were used to reduce a protein sample (30 µl of 1 mm protein), which was then passed over the equilibrated desalting column. Oxygenated samples were collected in sealed 550-µl glass cuvettes that had been flushed with the appropriate atmosphere and were then used in laser flash photolysis experiments. The photolysis beam in the oxygen experiments was generated with a Candela liquid dye laser using 30 µmrhodamine 575 dye in methanol as the lasing medium. The data in Fig.2 B were collected at 435 nm; this wavelength displayed the largest absorbance change following laser flash and is presumed to be the pentacoordinate deoxy absorbance maximum. Curve fitting analysis and generation of figures were done using the program Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc). Fig.1 is an overlay of the absorbance spectra of sperm whale myoglobin (Mb), rice nonsymbiotic hemoglobin 1 (rHb1), and human NHb in the reduced, deoxygenated forms. The split peak in the visible region, similar to cytochrome b5, is characteristic of a hexacoordinate heme iron and a signature of hxHbs (18Duff S.M.G. Wittenberg J.B. Hill R.D. J. Biol.

The NHb absorbance peak positions are nearly identical to those of rHb1, suggesting bis-histidyl coordination in both the ferric and deoxy ferrous forms. Equation 1 describes intramolecular hexacoordination and ligand binding following flash photolysis under conditions where exogenous ligand dissociation is slow with respect to rate constants for hexacoordination and bimolecular ligand binding (27Trent III., J.T.

Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this method, time courses for ligand rebinding are fit by a two exponential decay to generate the two rate constants γ1 and γ2. These rate constants share the following relationships with respect to the mechanism in Equation 1.γ1+γ2=k−H+kH+kL′[L](Eq. 2) γ1γ2=k−HkL′[L](Eq. 3) A plot of γ1 + γ2 versus[L] is linear, with a slope equal tok′L and a y intercept ofk −H + k H. The slope of the plot of γ1γ2 versus [L] provides k′−H when divided byk′L; k′H is determined by subtracting k′−H from the previous yintercept. Time courses for carbon monoxide and oxygen binding following flash photolysis were treated according to this method. This measured the bimolecular association rate constant for each ligand to the pentacoordinate protein and also the rate constants for association and dissociation of the distally hexacoordinating residue. Fig.2 graphically illustrates this data analysis process. Time courses for carbon monoxide association are shown as a function of [CO] in Fig. 2 A. Each time course was fit to two exponential terms, providing the values of γ1 and γ2 used in Equations 2 and 3. The sum of these rate constants is plotted against [CO] in Fig.2 C and has a slope of 38 µm−1s−1 and a y intercept of 18,000 s−1. A plot of γ1γ2 versus [CO] is shown in Fig. 2 D and has a slope of 310,000 µm−1 s−2 and ay intercept near zero.

The biphasic nature of these data is evident, particularly at higher O2 concentrations. Plots of γ1 + γ2 and γ1γ2 versus [O2] are shown along with those for CO in Fig. 2, C andD. The slopes of the data in Fig. 2 C indicate that the bimolecular rate constant for oxygen binding is 130 µm−1 s−1. The yintercepts of Fig. 2, C and D, are within error of one another, indicating that the same values ofk′H and k′−H were measured independently with both CO and O2 as exogenous ligands. Previously described methods (29Olson J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 631-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Moore E. Gibson Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing ligand replacement reactions initiated by stopped flow rapid mixing were used to determine the O2 and CO dissociation rate constants reported for human NHb in Table I. The dissociation rate constant for oxygen (k O2) is calculated from the following relationship, where k obs is the rate constant observed for the replacement reaction, andk′O2 and k′CO are the bimolecular rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding. kO2=kobs1+kO2′kCO′[O2][CO](Eq. 4) Reactions performed using 1000 µm [CO] as the displacing ligand and protein samples saturated under different concentrations of oxygen (262 and 1250 µm) provided corroborating values of 0.3 s−1 fork O2. CO dissociation experiments used 2000 µm NO as the displacing ligand with protein samples in less than 50 µm CO. Under these conditions,k obs is equivalent to k COand was measured to be 0.007 s−1 for NHb. As a hexacoordinate hemoglobin, human NHb is a fundamentally different protein than Mb and human Hb. Neuroglobin possesses biophysical characteristics that are more in common with the bacterial and plant hxHbs. The presence of these relatively similar proteins in so many different organisms hints at a possible common physiological function that remains to be identified. The discussion presented here provides a comparison of ligand binding in NHb and several other Hbs in the context of known and possible functions of these proteins. Spectroscopic analysis of a reduced, deoxygenated Hb (Fig. 1) clearly distinguishes between pentacoordinate and hexacoordinate heme proteins. Fig. 1illustrates the similarity of the spectra from rHb1 and NHb and demonstrates the difference between the coordination states of these proteins and pentacoordinate Mb. In addition to the equilibrium spectral signature, further demonstration of hexacoordinate character is shown by the biphasic time courses for ligand rebinding following flash photolysis (Fig. 2). Biphasic time courses for both CO and O2 rebinding in NHb are indicative of very rapid hexacoordination rate constants. Values of k′H andk′−H are smaller in rHb1, and the bimolecular reaction with O2 out-competes hexacoordination, resulting in single exponential rebinding (19Hargrove M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The bimolecular rate constants for O2 and CO binding to NHb are fast compared with the vertebrate globins and plant nsHbs, on a level similar to those of soybean Lba and the nerve Mb fromAphrodite (31Wittenberg J.B. Appleby C.A. Wittenberg B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 527-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dewilde S. Blaxter M. Van Hauwaert M. Vanfleteren J. Esmans E. Marden M. Griffon N. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19865-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the oxygen dissociation rate constants for Aphrodite nerve Mb and soybean Lba are much faster than that of NHb. With respect to O2dissociation, NHb is more similar to the plant nsHbs,Synechocystis Hb, and the hexacoordinateChlamydomonas Hb, all of which have slow oxygen dissociation rate constants. This combination of rate constants (k′O2 > 100 µm−1s−1 and k O2 < 1 s−1) makes NHb unique among previously characterized hxHbs, nerve Hbs, and the other human Hbs. The equilibrium affinity constant has traditionally been reported as the value of physiological relevance when evaluating the potential for oxygen transport by Hb. It is usually reported as K d orP 50, where both terms describe the oxygen concentration necessary to achieve half-saturation. The relationship between fractional saturation and ligand concentration in non-cooperative pentacoordinate Hbs is given by Equation 5 in whichK′L = 1/K d =k′L/k L. fHb=KL′[L]1+KL′[L](Eq. 5) The hxHbs differ from pentacoordinate Hbs in that the effects of competition between intramolecular coordination and exogenous ligand binding must be considered when calculating an equilibrium affinity constant. The effects of hexacoordination on ligand binding are described by the following mechanism.HbH⇄kHk−HHbP+L⇄kLkL′HbL(Eq. 6) In this equation, HbH is the hexacoordinate species,L is the exogenous ligand, k′L is the bimolecular rate constant for ligand binding to HbP, andk L is the ligand dissociation rate constant. The equilibrium affinity of hxHbs is directly affected byK H, the equilibrium constant for hexacoordination. Fractional saturation of a hxHb is calculated using Equation 7, whereK H = k H/k −H.fHbL=KL′1+KH[L]1+KL′1+KH[L](Eq. 7) Equation 7 incorporates the influence of hexacoordination on the fraction of ligand-bound protein, so the effective affinity constant with respect to Equation 5 is described by Equation 8 (21Trevaskis B. Watts R.A. Andersson C.R. Llewellyn D.J. Hargrove M.S. Olson J.S. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12230-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 33Watts R. Characterisation on Non-symbiotic Haemoglobins from Dicotyledonous Plants. Doctoral thesis. Division of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia1999Google Scholar).KL,H′=KL′1+KH(Eq. 8) This equation indicates that hexacoordination has the net effect of reducing the affinity of a hemoglobin for ligands, and the value ofK H determines the degree of reduction. AsK H for NHb is equal to 1.2, ligand affinities in this protein are effectively half that expected were only the bimolecular association and ligand dissociation rate constants considered. The affinity constants reported in Table I, calculated using Equation 8, reflect modulation by hexacoordination. Even so, our value for NHb oxygen affinity is ∼1000 times higher than that reported for mouse NHb, which was determined by equilibrium binding methods (16Burmester T. Welch B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). However, an affinity as high as that reported here makes equilibrium binding extremely difficult to measure, as protein concentrations would need to be in the sub-nanomolar range to prevent stoichiometric binding. The potential importance of the role of hemoglobins in facilitated diffusion of oxygen and other ligands was first investigated by Wittenberg (34Wittenberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 104-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Wyman (35Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 115-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the 1960s. The term facilitated diffusion was used to describe the observation that solutions of ferrous Mb (and some other Hbs) could transport oxygen along a concentration gradient more efficiently than buffer alone. However, for hemoglobins to carry out this function they must be partially saturated in the transport gradient and their kinetic rate constants cannot limit the speed of diffusion (36Murray J. Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5903-5906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mb and human Hb have oxygen affinities and protein concentrations that fall within these parameters, allowing oxygen transport in their respective environments. However, Hbs with extremes in affinity need a corresponding extreme in environment to function in facilitated diffusion. Leghemoglobins are an example of this; their high affinity for oxygen (∼20 times that of Mb) enables transport of oxygen in the hypoxic root nodules of leguminous plants (31Wittenberg J.B. Appleby C.A. Wittenberg B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 527-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Appleby C.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 443-478Crossref Google Scholar). NHb does not meet the kinetic and equilibrium requirements for functioning in oxygen transport by facilitated diffusion under known physiological conditions. Its oxygen affinity is so high that to serve in this role would require physiological oxygen gradients in the nanomolar range. The example set by leghemoglobins indicates that a role in the facilitated diffusion of other ligands, or under unique concentration gradients, may still be possible. However, it is more likely that NHb serves in a functional role similar to those postulated for other new Hbs such as NO or O2 scavenging or as a sensor for gaseous ligands like CO, NO, or O2. These roles have been attributed recently to other hemoglobins and heme proteins for which homologous proteins have not yet been identified in mammals (38Minning D. Gow A. Bonaventura J. Braun R. Dewhirst M. Goldberg D. Stamler J. Nature. 1999; 401: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar,39Weber R. Vinogradov S. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 569-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of hexacoordination as a ligand binding regulatory mechanism has not been established with certainty, but a comparison of the hexacoordination parameters of NHb and the other hxHbs reveals the beginning of a precedent in the rates associated with the distally coordinating residue. K H varies by less than 20-fold in all of the hxHbs for which this value has been measured, and both the rate constants for association and dissociation of this residue are on the order of exogenous ligand binding in each protein. For hexacoordination to serve as a mechanism in regulating exogenous ligand binding, it would have to display exactly this sort of behavior. If K H were too large, exogenous ligands could not bind. If k H and k −Hwere too small, a rapid equilibrium between hexacoordination and ligand binding would not be established. Although data are still quite limited, observations thus far support the hypothesis of hexacoordination having a functionally significant role in ligand binding regulation. The work presented here has identified human neuroglobin as the first hexacoordinate hemoglobin characterized in vertebrates. Our study of its kinetic behavior indicates that it does not function in a role similar to the other human Hbs. As no physiological role(s) is known for other hxHbs, the function of neuroglobin in the human brain remains an intriguing subject of research."

Bacterial ExoI (and presumably ExoX) can remove the mismatch through its 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity in cases where the nick is 3′ of the mismatch (27Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Although eukaryotic members of the MutS and MutL protein family appear to function similarly compared with their E. coli orthologs (5Kolodner R.D. Marsischky G.T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), experimental results suggest a slightly different pathway for downstream events in eukaryotes. First, a homolog for MutH or a DNA helicase activity linked to MMR has not been identified. Second, a class of proteins with double-strand 5′ → 3′ exonuclease and flap-endonuclease activities has been described, which includesSaccharomyces cerevisiae EXO1 (32Tishkoff D., X. Amin N.S.

Anexo1- strain exhibited a 4–13-fold increased mutation rate in a G → T transversion assay (33Szankasi P. Smith G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3014-3023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mutation rate of S. cerevisiae msh2 mutants was severalfold higher than exoI mutants, this rate was not significantly elevated in exo1 msh2 double mutants (40Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7487-7492Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 41Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These results suggested that msh2 and exo1 were likely to be epistatic (although additivity was not entirely ruled out). Yeast strains harboring a replicative DNA polymerase δ defective in its 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease (pol3–01) in combination with a deletion of exo1 or msh2 display similarly elevated mutation rates (41Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and haploid yeast strains with a DNA polymerase δ proofreading defect combined with a deletion ofexo1 or msh2 are lethal (41Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, these results suggest yeast EXO1 plays a role in mutation avoidance and supports a model in which the 5′ → 3′ activity of EXO1 and the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of polymerase δ participate in a bidirectional MMR (41Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence also indicate that EXO1 functions in additional pathways. EXOI expression is UV-inducible, and EXO1 mutant yeast strains display a mild UV sensitivity (42Qiu, J., Guan, M.-X., Bailis, A. M., and Shen, B. (1998)Nucleic Acids Res. 26.Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic evidence in yeast (43Fiorentini P. Huang K.N. Tishkoff D.X. Kolodner R.D. Symington L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and the observation of high hExoI/HEX1 expression in testis (32Tishkoff D., X. Amin N.S. Viars C.S. Arden K.C. Kolodner R.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5027-5031PubMed Google Scholar, 44Lee B.-I. Shannon M. Stubbs L. Wilson D.M.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4114-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggest the involvement of these proteins in meiotic and mitotic recombination. hExoI also shows RNase H activity, and it may function as backup for FEN1 in RNA primer removal during lagging strand DNA synthesis (45Qiu J. Qian Y. Chen V. Guan M.-X. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that hExoI interacts directly with hMSH2in vitro (38Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar). hExoI has been demonstrated to functionally complement a yeast exo1 mutant strain, and the truncated version of hExoI, termed HEX1 (or hExoIa), has both single-stranded and double-stranded 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity in vitro (32Tishkoff D., X. Amin N.S. Viars C.S. Arden K.C. Kolodner R.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5027-5031PubMed Google Scholar,45Qiu J. Qian Y. Chen V. Guan M.-X. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17893-17900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the interactions of hExoI with other human MutS and MutL homologs. Characterization of the interaction regions suggests a mechanism for recognition, signaling and excision of the damage. Our results support a role for hExoI in downstream events associated with MMR and/or other metabolic processes involving MMR enzymes. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST)/in vitrotranscription/translation (IVTT) protein-protein interaction assay was performed essentially as described (38Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hExoI, hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, hMLH1, hPMS2, and relevant fragments of these constructs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which allows high expression of a GST fusion protein, and were transformed intoE. coli XL1-blue. A 10-ml overnight culture was diluted with LB medium to 800 ml and grown at 37 °C until theA 600 of the culture was 0.5. Adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubation for 2 h at 30 °C induced protein expression. The culture was harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, and 2 µg/ml pepstatin. The cells were lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles in the presence of 100 µg/ml lysozyme and Triton X-100 (0.2%) and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). DNase I was then added to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and cellular debris removed by centrifugation. The cleared supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle continuous agitation. Under these conditions, ∼20–50 ng of protein was bound to 25 µl of beads. Samples were pelleted for 1 min at 300 × g, and each pellet was washed three times with 500 µl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 10, 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, and 1 µg/ml pepstatin). Lysates containing the unmodified pGEX vector were treated similarly and used as a negative control. GST and GST fusion protein binding to the beads was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and quantitated using bovine serum albumin as a standard as previously described (46Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To produce35S-labeled proteins, hExoI, hMSH2, hMSH3, hMSH6, hMLH1, hPMS2, and fragments thereof where subcloned into pET24d (Novagen), and 1 µg of these constructs was used in IVTT (TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system; Promega). The labeled proteins were quantitated as described (46Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein from each IVTT mix was added to the suspension of protein-bound glutathione beads in 500 µl of binding buffer. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h under gentle agitation. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, visualized, and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. The GST-IVTT interaction assay system is not absolutely quantitative and is likely to depend on the relative association constant (ka) of the individual interacting proteins. Thus, subtle changes in the relative concentration of interacting peptides may influence the ultimate measure of interaction. In order to provide modest control between experiments for such concentration-dependent processes, we determined the approximate molar concentrations of the GST fusion protein and the IVTT protein as described previously (46Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Interaction experiments were designed to contain an equivalent ratio of the test peptides. Relative interaction (Intrel) was determined as the fraction of the peptide interaction-ratio (IRp) divided by the wild type interaction ratio (IRwt): Intrel = IRp/IRwt. IRp represents the quantitated amount of interacting peptide (PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA)) divided by the quantitated amount of IVTT protein initially added to the reaction (expression control). These quantifications take the amount of [35S]Met in the peptides into consideration. The wild type interaction ratio (IRwt) was calculated similarly by quantifying the amount of wild type IVTT protein precipitated in an interaction experiment and dividing it by the wild type IVTT expression control. Thus, each interaction precipitation was normalized to the amount of protein expressed by IVTT and introduced into the interaction experiment. It is important to note that the quatitation of peptide interaction is always relative to the full-length wild type protein. In several cases, the quantitation of truncated peptides revealed relative interaction greater than the wild type protein. In these cases, the interaction is set at 100% with an asterisk above thebar graph in the figures to indicate that it was more efficient than the full-length peptide. An hExoI construct containing a deletion of the NH2-terminal catalytic domain (amino acids 1–128) was overproduced in E. coli and used to generate a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Strategic Biosolutions). This antibody recognizes recombinant hExoI protein. Immunoprecipitations were performed using HeLa total cell extract. Protein A beads (Sigma) were exposed overnight at 4 °C to antibodies specific for hExoI, hMLH1, or hPMS2, respectively, in a solution of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mmDTT, and protease inhibitors. The beads were then washed and incubated with HeLa cell extract for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times, and the proteins were separated by PAGE and detected by Western blotting. We have demonstrated previously that hExoI interacts with hMSH2 (38Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role in human MMR and/or recombination repair processes that involve the MMR lesion-recognition processes. To further explore the role of hExoI, we examined its interaction with several other human MMR proteins using the GST/IVTT bait-prey interaction system described previously (38Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar, 46Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A [35S]Met-labeled IVTT reaction containing the interacting partner (or specified truncation mutations) was prepared, quantitated as a function of [35S]Met-specific activity, and equivalent molar quantities introduced into each interaction mix. Specific interaction(s) were distinguished from nonspecific binding by quantitating the relative interaction (Intrel) of the35S-labeled IVTT mix (prey) between the GST fusion protein (bait) compared with the GST moiety (control) alone (38Schmutte C. Marinescu R.C. Sadoff M.M. Guerrette S. Overhauser J. Fishel R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4537-4542PubMed Google Scholar, 46Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As an additional control, we have observed that none of the interaction deficiencies appeared to be the result of protein degradation in the interaction mix, since no altered peptide sizes or fragments were detected following incubation and direct examination (data not shown). Any background of smaller-than-predicted peptide fragments present in the IVTT reaction and/or interaction experiments were found to represent internal translation start sites contained in the IVTT subclone, which are generated in the IVTT reaction (data not shown). In addition, treatment of the GST/IVTT extracts with DNase did not alter the results, suggesting that contaminating DNA does not mediate any of the observed interactions (data not shown). Although it is possible that our peptide deletion constructs do not adopt an entirelywild type conformation, it is important to note that the interaction regions identified for hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 by this methodology (46Guerrette S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6616-6623Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have been largely confirmed by comparison to the crystal structure of bacterial MutS (12Obmolova G. Ban C. Hsieh P. Yang W. Nature. 2000; 407: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 13Lamers M.H. Perrakis A. Enzlin J.H. Winterwerp H.H.K. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Using the GST/IVTT methodology, we observed strong interactions relative to GST-hExoI with IVTT-hMSH2 (Intrel-hMSH2) between GST-hExoI with IVTT-hMLH1 and IVTT-hMSH3, whereas only weak interactions were detected between GST-hExoI with IVTT-hMSH6, IVTT-hPMS1, or IVTT-hPMS2, respectively (Fig.1). An identical pattern was found by performing the reciprocal interaction(s) where interaction between GST-MMR proteins and IVTT-hExoI was examined (data not shown). The robust interaction(s) between hExoI with hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMLH1 allowed the identification of detailed interaction regions. We determined the interaction region between GST-hMSH2 with IVTT-hExoI (Fig.2A). The truncations of amino acids 1–128 (hExoI(del 1)) and amino acids 1–261 (hExoI(del 2)) as well as a central deletion of amino acids 267–490 (hExoI(del 3)) did not significantly diminish the hExoI peptide IVTT interaction with full-length GST-hMSH2, relative to the full-length hExoI (Intrel-hExoI). However, the Intrel-hExoI of the hExoI peptide IVTT interaction was substantially reduced when amino acids 388–680 (hExoI(del 4)) or the COOH-terminal amino acids 640–846 (hExoI(del 5)) were removed and completely abolished when amino acids 604–846 (hExoI(del 7)) were deleted. These results suggest that the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 604–846 of hExoI were likely involved in the specific interaction with hMSH2 (see shaded area of Fig. 2 A). This conclusion was confirmed with the observation of a specific association between GST-hMSH2 and IVTT amino acids 600–846 of hExoI (hExoI(del 9)). However, there may be several subinteraction regions within amino acids 603–846 of hExoI, since the Intrel-hExoI of the IVTT peptide containing an internal deletion of amino acids 603–744 (hExoI(del 8)) and amino acids 603–787 (hExoI(del 10)) continue to display binding to GST-hMSH2. We similarly determined the reciprocal interaction region of the IVTT-hMSH2 protein with GST-hExoI (Fig. 2 B). The hMSH2 protein was initially divided into three overlapping IVTT peptide fragments. The IVTT amino-terminal (hMSH2(del 1)) and carboxyl-terminal (hMSH2(del 3)) regions of hMSH2 displayed extremely weak interaction with GST-hExoI relative to full-length hMSH2 (Intrel-hMSH2). However, a strong Intrel-hMSH2was obtained with IVTT amino acids 251–750 (hMSH2(del 2)). The hMSH2 protein was further divided into four non-overlapping IVTT peptide fragments (hMSH2(del 4–del 7)), none of which displayed significant interaction, although amino acids 251–498 (hMSH2(del 5)) and amino acids 499–750 (hMSH2(del 6)) displayed a weakly detectable association. The interaction with GST-hExoI appeared to be completely restored when IVTT-hMSH2 amino acids 162–771 (hMSH2(del 8)) and amino acids 370–760 (hMSH2(del 9)) were included. These results suggested that a strong hExoI interaction region was likely to exist between amino acids 370 and 760 of hMSH2 (hMSH2-(aa 370–760)). Interestingly, subdivision of hMSH2-(aa 370–760) into IVTT peptides containing amino acids 460–760 (hMSH2(del 10)) or amino acids 460–707 (hMSH2(del 11)) resulted in a severe reduction in Intrel-hMSH2 binding to GST-hExoI, while IVTT peptides containing amino acids 370–669 (hMSH2(del 12)), 306–669 (hMSH2(del 13)), 370–707 (hMSH2(del 14)), and 261–669 (hMSH2(del 15)) did not significantly reduce the interaction with GST-hExoI. These results imply that amino acids 261–669 of hMSH2 are essential for its interaction with hExoI. Interestingly, deletion of 71 amino acids (aa 601–671) from a nearly full-length IVTT-hMSH2 (aa 134–934) nearly abolished the interaction with GST-hExoI (hMSH2(del 16)). We conclude that amino acids 601–671 of hMSH2 are necessary for interaction with hExoI, and that hMSH2-(aa 261–600) may further stabilize this interaction and/or allow enhanced peptide-folding of the interaction region (see shaded area of Fig. 2 B). The interaction region between IVTT-hExoI and GST-hMSH3 was determined (Fig. 3A). An NH2-terminal truncation of 128 amino acids (hExoI(del1)), internal deletion of amino acids 388–680 (hExoI(del 4)), or a COOH-terminal truncation of amino acids 604–846 (hExoI(del 7)) within hExoI did not diminish interaction with GST-hMSH3 relative to the full-length hExoI (Intrel-hExoI). A deletion of the NH2-terminal 261 amino acids (hExoI(del 2)), or the internal deletion of amino acids 267–490 ((hExoI(del 3)), amino acids 603–744 (hExoI(del 8)), or amino acids 603–787 (hExoI(del 10)) moderately reduced the Intrel-hExoI between the IVTT hExoI peptide and GST-hMSH3. However, a peptide containing amino acids 600–846 (hExoI(del 9)) displayed no interaction with GST-hMSH3. Taken together, these results suggest that the COOH terminus of hExoI is not required for interaction with hMSH3 and that the minimal NH2-terminal interaction region encompasses amino acids 129–387 of hExoI (see shaded areas of Fig.3 A). The interaction region between IVTT-hMSH3 and GST-hExoI was determined to be also NH2-terminal (Fig. 3 B). Of the subdivided hMSH3 overlapping peptides, only the peptide containing amino acids 1–617 (hMSH3(del 1)) was found to significantly interact with GST-hExoI (note that the interaction was actually greater than the full-length protein). Subdivision of amino acids 1–297 of hMSH3 (hMSH3(del 4–6)) resulted in further definition of the interaction region with hExoI. Since all three peptides displayed a significant Intrel-hMSH3, we conclude that the minimal hExoI interaction region of hMSH3 spans amino acids 75–297 (seeshaded area of Fig. 3 B). The lack of an additional interaction region outside hMSH3-(aa 75–297) was confirmed with the hMSH3(del 7) IVTT peptide. It appears that del7 has a slightly increased mobility than predicted (compare del4 (297 amino acids) with del 7 (334 amino acids)). This may be a result of electrophoretic conditions or the intrinsic properties of the peptide (which contains a region of high polarity). Our initial studies suggest that hExoI displayed a more robust interaction with hMLH1 compared with hMSH2 (Fig. 1). We further defined the region(s) of IVTT-hExoI interaction with GST-hMLH1 (Fig.4A). Deletion of amino acids 1–128 (hExoI(del 1)) and amino acids 1–261 (hExoI(del 2)) of hExoI did not significantly affect its interaction with GST-hMLH1. Moreover, determination of the Intrel-hExoI suggested that the interaction of hExoI(del 1) and hExoI(del 2) was significantly greater than the full-length hMLH1 protein. These results suggest that the extreme amino terminus of hExoI may modulate its interaction with hMLH1. Furthermore, deletion of the COOH-terminal amino acids 640–846 (hExoI(del 5)) or amino acids 604–846 (hExoI(del 7)) as well as the NH2-terminal amino acids 1–599 (hExoI(del 9)) significantly reduced its interaction with GST-hMLH1. In addition, the internal deletion of amino acids 388–680 (hExoI(del 4)) or amino acids 267–490 (hExoI(del 3)) as well as a peptide containing only amino"

They are involved in setting the frequency of neuronal firing and heart pacing. Altered Kv4.3 channel expression has been demonstrated under pathological conditions like heart failure indicating their critical role in heart function. Thyroid hormone studies suggest that their expression in the heart may be hormonally regulated. To explore the possibility that sex hormones control Kv4.3 expression, we investigated whether its expression changes in the pregnant uterus. This organ represents a unique model to study Ito currents, because it possesses this type of K+ current and undergoes dramatic changes in function and excitability during pregnancy. We cloned Kv4.3 channel from myometrium and found that its protein and transcript expression is greatly diminished during pregnancy. Experiments in ovariectomized rats demonstrate that estrogen is one mechanism responsible for the dramatic reduction in Kv4.3 expression and function prior to parturition. Furthermore, the reduction of plasma membrane Kv4.3 protein is accompanied by a perinuclear localization suggesting that cell trafficking is also controlled by sex hormones. Thus, estrogen remodels the expression of Kv4.3 in myometrium by directly diminishing its transcription and, indirectly, by altering Kv4.3 delivery to the plasma membrane.

Bosch R.F. Kuhlkamp V. Seipel L. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2000; 11: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and human heart failure (4Kaab S. Dixon J. Duc J. Ashen D. Nabauer M. Beuckelmann D.J. Steinbeck G. McKinnon D. Tomaselli G.F. Circulation. 1998; 98: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) exhibit a reduced expression of this class of channels. However, in other systems like smooth muscle their role is less clear. Kv4.3 transcripts have been detected in mesenteric artery (5Xu H. Guo W. Nerbonne J.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 661-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), aortic, vas deferens, stomach, and urinary bladder (6Ohya S. Tanaka M. Oku T. Asai Y. Watanabe M. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) smooth muscles, but correlation with their function in intact tissues is still missing. Ito (A-type) currents in smooth muscle were first reported in uterine smooth muscle (7Piedras Renteria E. Stefani E. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C278-C284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later have been reported in renal (8Gordienko D.V. Clausen C. Goligorsky M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F325-F341PubMed Google Scholar) and pulmonary (9Yuan X.-J. Tod M.L. Rubin L.J. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C259-C270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) vascular beds and in colonic smooth muscle (10Koh S.D. Ward S.M. Dick G.M. Epperson A. Bonner H.P. Sanders K.M. Horowitz B. Kenyon J.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 475-487Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the heart, Ito currents can be formed, depending on the species, by either Kv4.3 and/or Kv4.2 channels (2Hoppe U.C. Marban E. Johns D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Wang Z. Feng J. Shi H. Pond A. Nerbonne J.M. Nattel S. Circ.

Res. 1998; 83: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Given the facts that in myocardial dysfunction the Kv4 genes are down-regulated and their protein and mRNA distribution seems specific for different heart regions, transcriptional regulation may be a significant factor that controls potassium channel molecular remodeling (3Grammer J.B. Bosch R.F. Kuhlkamp V. Seipel L. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 2000; 11: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 4Kaab S. Dixon J. Duc J. Ashen D. Nabauer M. Beuckelmann D.J. Steinbeck G.

Furthermore, the transcription seems to be under hormonal control, because the reduction in Kv4.3 and Kv4.2 mRNA levels after myocardial infarction can be restored by the administration of thyroid hormone (17Wickenden A.D. Kaprielian R. You X.M. Backx P.H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1105-H1116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that in smooth muscle Kv4 genes are also under transcriptional regulation during pathological and physiological conditions. In keeping with this view, we now show that in myometrium the Kv4.3gene may be the predominant molecular correlate of Ito currents and that its expression varies during pregnancy, with the rise of estrogen being one important factor that determines the Kv4.3 down-regulation at the end of pregnancy. Animal protocols were approved by the UCLA School of Medicine Animal Committee. Sprague-Dawley rats were used at non-pregnant stage (diestrus/estrus) and various times of pregnancy (days 7–8, 10–11, 13–15, 17–18, 19–22) or 6–12 h postpartum (n = 3–5 in each group). Ovariectomized (ovx1) rats were purchased from Charles River. Prior to tissue collection, rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal).Xenopus oocytes were obtained from adult femaleXenopus laevis (Xenopus One, Ltd.). Ovx rats were injected subcutaneously twice a day. One group of rats was injected for 4 days with 3 mg/kg progesterone (P4) or 50 µg/kg 17-β estradiol (E2). The second group, E2-primed rats, was initially injected for 2 days with 50 µg/kg E2 and afterward for 4 days with 3 mg/kg P4. As control, the same injection protocol was performed with the vehicle (2 ml/kg 1:10 ethanol:sesame oil). Seven to eight rats were used in each group. E2 and P4 stock solutions were in 100% ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/ml E2 and 30 mg/ml P4. Rats were sacrificed 12 h after the last injection. Tissue and blood samples were obtained at the same time. Plasma levels of P4 and E2 were determined using radioimmunoassay by Dr. John K. H. Lu, Departments OB & GYN-Endo/Neurobiology at UCLA. One day before injection, oocytes were defolliculated with collagenase treatment (2 mg/ml for 40 min at room temperature). Oocytes were maintained at 19 °C in Barth solution supplemented with 50 µg/ml gentamicin. Kv4.3 currents were recorded 2 days after cRNA injection (10 ng per oocyte) using the cut-open oocyte vaseline gap voltage clamp (18Stefani E. Toro L. Perozo E. Bezanilla F. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 996-1010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The external solution was (in mm): 120 sodium-methanesulfonate (Na-MES), 2 Ca-(MES)2, 10 Na-HEPES, pH 7.0. The internal solution contained (in mm): 110 K-glutamate, 10 K-HEPES, pH 7.0. The intracellular recording pipette contained (in mm): 2700 Na-MES, 10 NaCl, 10 Na-HEPES, pH 7.0. The oocyte interior was permeabilized with 0.1% saponin. Uterine single smooth muscle cells were isolated the day of the experiment and were used within 6–8 h after isolation. Rat uterus was received in ice-cold Ca2+-free Krebs solution oxygenated with 95% O2-5% CO2 containing (in mm): 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.17 MgSO4, 22 NaHCO3, 1.18 KH2PO4, 8 HEPES, 5 glucose, pH 7.4. The myometrium was dissected by peeling off the endometrial layer, left to recover for 30 min under constant oxygenation, and cut into pieces (∼2 mm). Tissue was incubated on ice for 90 min with Ca2+-free Krebs solution containing 30 units/ml papain (Sigma Chemical Co.), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with shaking. The tissue was incubated for another 35–55 min at 37 °C with 1.3 mg/ml collagenase F, 2120 units/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma), 206 units/ml collagenase type 4, 9.2 units/ml elastase, and 1.5 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Worthington). Tissue was washed with Ca2+-free Krebs solution and dispersed with a wide bore polished Pasteur pipette; cells were directly plated on the glass bottom of the recording chamber. Whole-cell currents were measured using the whole cell patch method. The patch electrodes (∼3 MΩ) were made from borosilicate glass capillary tubing with filament. The pipette was filled with (in mm): 134 K-MES, 6 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.3. High concentration of EGTA makes the internal solution nominally Ca2+ free to minimize the activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. The bath solution is in mm: 2 KCl, 140 Na-MES, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.3. Cell capacity was measured using a 10- to 20-mV test pulse from a holding potential (HP) of 0 mV. Thereafter, cells were maintained at HP = −90 mV, and pulses in 10-mV increments were delivered from −80 to 160 mV. Non-linear components were subtracted from scaled pulses from −90 to −70 mV. Peak current amplitudes were normalized per cell capacity. Data were filtered at one-fourth the sampling frequency. Acquisition and analysis were performed with custom-made software. The Kv4.3 polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against the peptide (Y)NEALELTGTPEEEH[norleucine]GK (Alomone Laboratories, Israel), corresponding to residues 451–467 of rat Kv4.3 (19Serodio P. Vega-Saenz D.M. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) with an additional N-terminal tyrosine, and a methionine replaced with norleucine. The Kv4.3451–467 antiserum was affinity-purified on immobilized Kv4.3451–467 peptide. This antibody recognizes the three forms (long, medium, and short) of Kv4.3. The uterus from each rat was divided into two parts: a small part was used for immunostaining, and the rest was used for Western blots. Uterine horns were removed and placed in cold homogenization buffer (in mm): 20 HEPES-KOH, 1 EDTA, 250 sucrose, pH 7.4 containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µm pepstatin A, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 8 mg/ml calpain I and II inhibitors, 100 mg/ml benzamidine, and 0.2 mm Pefabloc. After careful scraping to remove the endometrium, the myometrium was finely minced and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to obtain crude membranes. Membranes were suspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.4. The protein content of the membrane preparations was measured using improved Lowry assay (Bio-Rad). Myometrial membranes were fractionated by standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting for identification and quantification of Kv4.3 and Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit. Briefly, membrane proteins (30 µg) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked in TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature prior to incubation with 1:400 affinity-purified Kv4.3451–467 rabbit polyclonal antibody or 1:4000 monoclonal antibody against the Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit in 1% nonfat milk/TBS for 12 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times in TBS for 30 min and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:4000) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. After washing, the blots were incubated in substrate for enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) for 1 min and autoradiographed on Kodak BioMax film. The bands were quantified using the Bio-Rad GS670 Imaging Densitometer and software. Results were expressed as Densitometric Units. The specificity of the antibody was tested by pre-adsorbing the antibody with the antigenic peptide. Pre-stained molecular weight standards (range 14.3–200 kDa) were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fresh uteri were fixed by immersion in fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 2% picric acid in 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 2 h. Transverse cryostat sections (10 µm) were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with either anti-Kv4.3451–467 affinity-purified antibody (1:250) or anti-smooth muscle α-actin monoclonal antibody (1:15,000) (Sigma) in 1% normal goat serum/0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with either Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG or Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). In the control sections, the Kv4.3 antibody was inactivated by addition of an excess amount of antigenic peptide (10 µg/ml). Images were acquired by optically sectioning tissues every 1 µm with a confocal microscope (Olympus) or with a conventional fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) and analyzed using the Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics) and Adobe Photoshop programs. Immunofluorescence intensity of the smooth muscle layers was measured in random fields. The results were expressed as Average Pixel Intensity. Approximately 100 ng of poly(A)+ RNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA by priming with an oligo-dT primer, followed by a 20-µl reverse transcription reaction with 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Conditions were: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Gene-specific primers for the Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and the various isoforms of the Kv4.3 channel are shown in Table I. As controls, we used the reaction mixture without the cDNA or plasmid DNA. The quality of cDNA was confirmed by the lack of detectable genomic DNA using primers flanking intronic regions (β-actin, Kv4.3 long and medium, Kv4.2 and Kv4.1, see Table I). We used real time PCR to quantify the relative abundance of each gene (iCycler iQ Real Time PCR, Bio-Rad) with SYBR green I (stock solution ×10,000 diluted at 1:80,000) as the fluorescent probe (Molecular Probes) and Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-udg (Life Technologies, Inc.) (20Ririe K.M. Rasmussen R.P. Wittwer C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Calibration curves were constructed using known concentrations of pre-amplifiedKv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 segments (amplicons) subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Reaction conditions were: 5 min at 95 °C to activate the “hot start” platinum Taq DNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s.Table IGene-specific primersGeneExperimentGenBank™ accession numberExpected amplicon size1-aUnless otherwise stated, expected sizes for amplicon cDNAs are given.Forward primersReverse primersnt 1-bnt, nucleotide numbers; underlined nucleotides, restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subcloning.Kv4.3Full-length cloning of Kv4.3 long formAF33479119945′-GCGCAGATCTGCCAC CATGGCGGCAGGAGT TGCAGCC-3′, nt 1–215′-GCGCAAGCTTTTACA AGACAGAGACCTTGA C-3′, nt 1948–1968Kv4.11-cPrimers could distinguish cDNA from genomic DNA (gDNA) serving as internal control (36).Detection ofKv4.1U898732935′-CCGTAAGCTTACTAG CGGGTCTTCGGAGGA-3′, nt 1228–12475′-ATCCGCGGCCGCTCA CAGGGAAGAGATCTT GA-3′, nt 1479–1498Kv4.21-cPrimers could distinguish cDNA from genomic DNA (gDNA) serving as internal control (36).Detection ofKv4.2S643202835′-CCGTAAGCTTGTGTC AGGAAGTCATAGAGGC-3′, nt 2184–22045′-ATCCGCGGCCGCTTA CAAAGCAGACACCCT GA-3′, nt 2424–2443Kv4.31-cPrimers could distinguish cDNA from genomic DNA (gDNA) serving as internal control (36).Detection of Kv4.3longAF3347912965′-CCGTAAGCTTGCAAG ACCACGTCACTCATC-3′, nt 1397–14165′-ATCCGCGGCCGCAGG TGCGTGGTCTTCTTG CT-3′, nt 1651–1670Kv4.31-cPrimers could distinguish cDNA from genomic DNA (gDNA) serving as internal control (36).Detection ofKv4.3 long and mediumAF334791342 (long); 285 (medium)5′-GCAAGCGCAATGGA CTCCTC-3′ nt 1331–13505′-GCAGGTGCGTGGTCT TCTTG-3′, nt 1653–1672Kv4.3Detection of Kv4.3shortL486193205′-AGCACCATCCACATC CAG-3′ nt 1762–17795′-ATAAAAACCAACCTC AC-3′ nt 2065–2081Kv4.3RPA probe forKv4.3U429752505′-GCGCGCGAATTCCCT TTTGCCCGGGCTGCG-3′, nt 86–1035′-GCACACGGATCCCAA AGAAGTACTCCTTGG-3′ nt 294–311β-Actin1-cPrimers could distinguish cDNA from genomic DNA (gDNA) serving as internal control (36).Detection ofβ-actinV01217494 708 (gDNA)5′-GGCTACAGCTTCACC ACCAC-3′, nt 2383–24025′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTG ATCCAC-3′ nt 3071–3091rNa+/K+-ATPaseRPA probe for rNa+/K+-ATPaseM286471575′-GCGCGCGAATTCCTC CATGATTGACCCTCC-3′ nt 2027–20445′-GCACACGGATCCAAT GCCCACCCCCTTAGC-3′ nt 2142–21591-a Unless otherwise stated, expected sizes for amplicon cDNAs are given.1-b nt, nucleotide numbers; underlined nucleotides, restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subcloning.1-c Primers could distinguish cDNA from genomic DNA (gDNA) serving as internal control (36Isbrandt D.

Open table in a new tab The rat uterus Kv4.3 full-length cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using the specific primers in Table I. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from non-pregnant rat uterus using ToTALLY RNA isolation kit (Ambion). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using Oligotex mRNA purification system (Qiagen) and was reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase). The PCR was performed in a 50-µl reaction using Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) under the following conditions: 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR product with the expected 2000-nt size was first analyzed with restriction enzymes; and, its identity was confirmed by complete sequencing. The PCR product was purified and subcloned into either pBSTAII vector (21Shih T.M. Smith R.D. Toro L. Goldin A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or into pcDNA3. Probe DNAs were obtained using RT-PCR amplification and gene-specific primers for rKv4.3and rNa + /K + -ATPase α 1 subunit (Table I). Myometrial cDNA (10 µl) was amplified with 3.5 units Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase in a 100-µl reaction for 35 cycles. The amplification products of the correct size were subcloned into EcoRI- andBamHI-digested pBluescript II KS vector. Radiolabeled antisense riboprobes, which contained bases of the vector (294 nt forrKv4.3 and 202 nt forrNa + /K + -ATPase) were synthesized from HindIII-linearized plasmid constructs with T7 RNA polymerase and [32P]UTP. RNase protection assays of rat total RNA isolated from non-pregnant myometrium and at different stages of pregnancy were performed using an RPA III kit (Ambion). For each sample, 40 µg of total RNA was hybridized with 3.5 × 105 cpm of the gel-purified RNA probes for 16 h at 42 °C and then digested with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1 at a final dilution of 1:100. Protected fragments were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. After drying the gel, it was exposed to a storage phosphor screen. The band intensities were quantified with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445 SI. Radioactive counts were quantified in identical areas, and values are expressed as a percentage of the total volume of all samples for a given clone. Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed by Student's ttest. A probability level less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Non-pregnant (7Piedras Renteria E. Stefani E. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C278-C284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and late (18 day) pregnant (22Satoh H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 23Wang S.Y. Yoshino M. Sui J.L. Wakui M. Kao P.N. Kao C.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 737-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) myometrial cells possess a fast, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive, transient outward current (Ito), but its molecular identity, functional role, and possible regulation during the course of pregnancy is still unknown. As mentioned, in other systems this current seems to be due to the activation of Kv4.3 and/or Kv4.2 channels. Transcripts ofKv4.3 have been detected in various smooth muscles (6Ohya S. Tanaka M. Oku T. Asai Y. Watanabe M. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); however, uterine smooth muscle has not been examined. Therefore, we initially screened with qualitative RT-PCR non-pregnant myometrium cDNA for Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3transcripts using gene-specific primers (see TableI). Fig.1A shows that transcripts of the three members of the Kv4 K+ channel family are present and that the Kv4.3 gene transcripts seem significantly more abundant in non-pregnant myometrium. To quantify the relative abundance of the Kv4.1,Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 transcripts we performed real time PCR using the same gene-specific primers used for RT-PCR. We initially tested if the primers for each gene had the same efficiency. To this end, we obtained the slopes of the standard curves (threshold cycle versus log [amplicon]) that gave values of 3.3, 3.0, and 3.0, respectively. These results indicate that the reaction efficiencies were similar for the three pairs of selected primers, validating our determinations. In addition, the adequacy of the fluorescent measurements with SYBR green I was confirmed by the fact that at the end of each reaction (40 cycles) a single product of the appropriate size was observed in agarose gel electrophoresis, and that the melting curve for each product had a single well defined peak (20Ririe K.M. Rasmussen R.P. Wittwer C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). The real time PCR results (Fig. 1 B) were similar to those obtained by RT-PCR and demonstrate that the predominant Kv4transcripts in uterus are of the Kv4.3 class. Thus, we focused our studies on the Kv4.3 K+ channel. The Kv4.3 K+ channel subfamily has three splice variants known as long, medium (19Serodio P. Vega-Saenz D.M. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2174-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and short (24Tsaur M.L. Chou C.C. Shih Y.H. Wang H.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The long form is identical to the medium form but with a splice insert of 19 amino acids between amino acids 506 (T) and 507 (N) (GenBank™ accession number U42975 for the medium form and numberU92897 for the insert). The short form differs from the medium form in its C terminus that is shorter with a different amino acid composition (GenBank™ accession number L48619). The long form is predominantly expressed in both cardiac and smooth muscle cells (6Ohya S. Tanaka M. Oku T. Asai Y. Watanabe M. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In agreement, RT-PCR with gene-specific primers for the short (Fig.2B) and either the medium and long isoforms (Fig. 2 A) indicated that the long isoform of Kv4.3 channel is predominantly expressed in non-pregnant myometrium (Fig. 2). To detect the medium and long forms simultaneously, specific primers flanking the splice insert of the long form (see Table I) were used. RT-PCR from non-pregnant (NP) and pregnant (P) myometrium showed only one strong band of the expected size for the long form (Fig. 2 A). As expected, RT-PCR with the same primers using brain cDNA from adult rats yielded two bands with the predicted sizes for the long (342 nt) and medium (285 nt) forms (Fig. 2 A, lane B). All products were confirmed by sequencing. In contrast, specific primers designed to detect the Kv4.3 short form result in barely detectable bands of the predicted size in non-pregnant (NP) and pregnant (P) myometrium (Fig. 2 B). As a positive control, the Kv4.3 short form was clearly detected in adult brain cDNA (Fig. 2 B, lane B). As an internal control, β-actin was also amplified using the same cDNAs and primers to check for possible genomic DNA contamination (Fig. 2 C). The β-actin product had the expected size for its corresponding cDNA. These results indicate that in non-pregnant and pregnant myometrium transcripts for theKv4.3 long form are abundantly present, whereas transcripts of the medium and short form are absent or very scarce, respectively. Several full-length clones from non-pregnant myometrium were obtained by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers that anneal to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Kv4.3 (see Table I). All the sequenced clones (three) were identical to the long isoform ofKv4.3 with the exception of a single base substitution at position 1891 (g for c) that encodes proline instead of an alanine (amino acid 631 according to GenBank™ accession number AF334791). This single base difference in rat myometrium Kv4.3 cDNA was confirmed four times using three different mRNA preparations and specific primers flanking position 631. Functional expression of the full-length RT-PCR product in X. laevisoocytes produced inactivating outward K+ currents (Fig.2 D) that were blocked by external application of 5 mm 4-aminopyridine and were insensitive to external tetraethylammonium (not shown). These Kv4.3 currents resemble native Ito currents recorded in non-pregnant rat myometrium in terms of their kinetics and pharmacology (7Piedras Renteria E. Stefani E. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C278-C284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Kv4.3 ionic current properties in conjunction with the qualitative PCR experiments and experiments with ovx rats (see Figs. 6and 7) support the view that Kv4.3 channels can be regarded as an important molecular component of Ito currents in myometrium.Figure 7Dramatic reduction of functional expression of transient outward (Ito) currents in E2-treated ovx rats.Outward K+ currents recorded under whole cell patch clamp in single smooth muscle cells from myometrium of ovx rats sham-injected with oil (A) and after E2 treatment (B). Cells were maintained at a HP of −90 mV, and pulses in 10-mV increments were delivered to +80 mV in A and to +160 mV in B. Current amplitudes were normalized by cell capacity.

The apoptosome recruits and activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 and -7, which then kill the cell by proteolysis. Because inactivation of this pathway may promote oncogenesis, we examined 10 ovarian cancer cell lines for resistance to cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation using a cell-free system. Strikingly, we found that cytosolic extracts from all cell lines had diminished cytochromec-dependent caspase activation compared with normal ovarian epithelium extracts. The resistant cell lines expressed APAF-1 and caspase-9, -3, and -7; however, each demonstrated diminished APAF-1 activity relative to the normal ovarian epithelium cell lines. A competitive APAF-1 inhibitor may account for the diminished APAF-1 activity because we did not detect dominant APAF-1 inhibitors, altered APAF-1 isoform expression, or APAF-1 deletion, degradation, or mutation. Lack of APAF-1 activity correlated in some but not all cell lines with resistance to apoptosis. These data suggest that regulation of APAF-1 activity may be important for apoptosis regulation in some ovarian cancers.

Regardless of the circumstance, induction and execution of apoptotic events require activation of caspases, a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteinases (1Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Caspase activation generally occurs via two pathways, one mediated by cell surface death receptors and the other regulated by the mitochondrion. In the death receptor pathway, death receptor ligation promotes clustering and activation of caspase-8 and -10, which in turn activate downstream caspases (reviewed in Ref. 2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). By contrast, chemotherapeutic agents, UV irradiation, and other agents induce caspase activation via the mitochondrial pathway. This pathway involves mitochondrial integration of apoptotic signals and subsequent release of cytochrome cinto the cytosol. The liberated cytochrome c, along with adenine nucleotides, initiates formation of an apoptosome consisting of apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (APAF-1)1 oligomers. The APAF-1 apoptosome recruits and activates caspase-9, which in turn activates the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -7 (3Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S.

Evasion or inactivation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway may contribute to oncogenesis by allowing cell accumulation (5Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1996; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Cell accumulation in some lymphoid malignancies, for example, involves overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 (reviewed in Ref. 6Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). bcl-2 accomplishes this by inhibiting release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, thereby promoting apoptosis resistance and cell survival (6Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that cancer cells can also attenuate caspase activity and resist apoptosis by mechanisms downstream of cytochrome c release. These include inhibition of cytosolic cytochrome c by heat shock protein (HSP)-27 (7Bruey J.-M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.-P. Kroemer G.

Ovarian epithelial cancer is the most lethal of the gynecological malignancies and affects more than 25,000 women per year (15Thigpen J.T. Abeloff M.D. Armitage J.O. Lichter A.S. Niederhuber J.E. Clinical Oncology. 2nd Ed. Chrchill Livingstone, New York2000: 2016-2040Google Scholar). Ovarian cancers often resist chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (16Auersperg N. Edelson M.I. Mok S.C. Johnson S.W. Hamilton T.C. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 281-304PubMed Google Scholar); however, whether biochemical defects in apoptotic pathways occur in ovarian cancer is largely unknown. Here we show that ovarian cancer cell lines resist cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation in a cell-free assay, and this resistance correlates with diminished APAF-1 activity. A subset of these cell lines also resisted apoptosis, and this could be partially overcome by APAF-1 transduction. These data suggest that regulation of APAF-1 activity may be important for apoptosis regulation in some ovarian cancers.

SV40 T-antigen-immortalized ovarian epithelial (IOSE) cells and ovarian cancer cell lines were derived from stocks in the Mills laboratory and originally obtained from R. Bast, N.

SKOV3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-APAF-1, or pcDNA3-caspase-9 using the FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After transfection, cells were selected for 3 weeks in media containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. The resultant G418-resistant cell populations were used for apoptosis studies and cell-free assays. We assessed cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation in cytosolic extracts using a cell-free assay. Reactions were initiated with 10 μm cytochrome c plus 1 mm dATP as detailed in the figure legends. After 30 min at 37 °C, DEVD-AFC was added to samples, and caspase activation was then assessed by monitoring amino-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin release using a Tecan SpectraFluor fluorimeter in the kinetic mode (21Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, extracts were mixed with in vitrotranscribed and translated caspase-9 (22Wolf B.B. Schuler M. Echeverri F. Green D.R. J. Biol.

We then assessed caspase activation by monitoring DEVD-AFC hydrolysis. Antibodies against APAF-1, actin, fodrin, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspase-3, -7, and -9 have been described previously (22Wolf B.B. Schuler M. Echeverri F. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30651-30656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (21Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from cell lines using the guanidinium isothiocyanate-based Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). We then synthesized APAF-1 cDNAs by RT-PCR using oligo(dT) priming and the SuperScript system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Polymerase chain reaction products were purified by gel filtration chromatography or agarose gel electrophoresis and then sequenced using Big Dye Terminator chemistry and an ABI 7600 automated DNA sequencer. A list of the primers used in this study is available on request. We determined the relative expression of the 12- and 13-WD repeat APAF-1 isoforms by RT-PCR using the primers described by Zou et al. (4Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). RT-PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% gels). This method yields 316- and 187-bp PCR products that correspond to the 13- and 12-WD repeat isoforms, respectively. Whole cell extracts were treated with ATP and ubiquitin to activate the proteasome according to Li and Dou (23Li B. Dou Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3850-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). We then assessed APAF-1 degradation by Western blotting after incubation of extracts at 37 °C for 1, 2, and 4 h. We treated cells with cisplatin or etoposide as detailed in the figure legends and then assessed apoptosis after 48–72 h by flow cytometry using staining with annexin V and propidium iodide (21Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify potential defects in cytochrome c/dATP-dependent caspase activation in ovarian cancer, we studied cytosolic extracts from normal and malignant ovarian epithelial cells using a cell-free system. We initiated cell-free apoptosis by adding cytochrome c (10 μm) plus dATP (1 mm) to each extract, and then we assessed caspase activation by monitoring hydrolysis of the caspase substrate DEVD-AFC (Fig. 1). NOE cells derived from two separate ovarian samples (NOE35 and NOE72) displayed the highest levels of caspase activation after cytochromec/dATP addition. Interestingly, both T-antigen-transformed cell lines (IOSE29 and IOSE80) and all eight of the ovarian cancer lines displayed diminished cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation relative to the NOE lines. We observed profound defects in the A2780, OVCA-432, and SKOV3 cell lines with caspase activation levels less than 10% of that of the NOE cell lines. Strikingly, the OCC1 cell line had undetectable levels of cytochrome c/dATP-dependent caspase activity. Note that Fig. 1 represents the caspase activities obtained from at least three independent extract preparations per cell line, indicating that activity differences are not merely due to variations in extract preparation. We next examined expression of apoptosome proteins in the ovarian cancer cell lines to determine whether their absence might account for the defective caspase activation observed in the cell-free assay. Fig. 2 shows that all cell lines expressed APAF-1 and caspase-3, -7, and -9 as assessed by Western blotting; however, expression levels varied significantly between the cell lines. Most cell lines expressed lower APAF-1 levels as compared with the NOE35 line. The OCC1 cell line had the most profound decrease in APAF-1 levels, expressing less than 25% of the NOE35 level. By contrast, most cell lines expressed higher levels of caspase-9 than the NOE35 cell line. We detected comparable amounts of caspase-3 in all cell lines, with the exception of the OCC1 cell line, which displayed markedly lower caspase-3 levels. Relative to the NOE35 cell line, diminished levels of caspase-7 were observed in the Hey and OCC1 cell lines, whereas the OVCA cell lines and the SKOV3 cell line expressed greater amounts of caspase-7. Even the cell lines with the lowest cytochrome c/dATP-dependent caspase activities retained expression of all apoptosome components (Fig. 2, highlighted in italic). Because we did not detect deletion of any apoptosome component, differences in APAF-1 and/or caspase activity must account for the variable levels of caspase activation observed in the cell-free assay. To determine the activity of executioner caspases (caspase-3 and -7) in the cytochromec/dATP-resistant cell lines, we added caspase activator granzyme B to each extract and monitored the generation of caspase activity. We focused on the T-antigen-transformed IOSE80 cell line and the A2780, OCC1, OVCA-432, and SKOV3 cell lines, the four cell lines with the lowest cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation (Fig. 1). Granzyme B activated DEVD-cleaving caspases in each of the resistant cell lines as shown in Fig. 3. Even the OCC1 line, which expressed relatively low levels of caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. 2), showed significant DEVDase activity with granzyme B. Similarly, granzyme B initiated DEVDase activity in the MCF7 breast cancer line, which expresses caspase-7 but lacks caspase-3. These data indicate intact executioner caspase activity in the cytochromec/dATP-resistant cell lines and suggest that they have diminished APAF-1 and/or caspase-9 activity. To determine whether the cytochromec/dATP-resistant cell lines had defects in APAF-1 and/or caspase-9 activity, we mixed extracts from resistant cell lines with extracts from MEFs and then assessed cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation. We reasoned that mixing WT MEF extracts with the resistant extracts would restore caspase activation, provided that they did not contain dominant inhibitors of APAF-1 and/or caspase-9. We could then localize the defect to APAF-1 or caspase-9 by determining whether APAF-1-null and caspase-9-null MEF extracts could restore caspase activation. We reasoned that if the resistant cell lines had defective APAF-1 activity, then mixing the extracts with caspase-9-null MEF extract (normal APAF-1, absent caspase-9), but not the APAF-null MEF extract (absent APAF-1, normal caspase-9), would restore caspase activation. By contrast, if the resistant cell lines had defective caspase-9 activity, then mixing the extracts with the APAF-1-null MEF extract, but not the caspase-9 null extract, would restore caspase activation. To validate this approach, we performed the experiments shown in Fig.4 A. The figure shows that cytochrome c and dATP initiate caspase activity in the WT MEF extract but fail to do so in the APAF-1-null and caspase-9-null extracts. However, mixing the WT extract 1:1 with the APAF-1-null extract or the caspase-null extract restores cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation. By contrast, diluting the WT extract 1:1 with buffer essentially inactivates the extract's cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation. Fig. 4 B shows the mixing experiments performed with the resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Note that mixing the resistant cell lines with WT MEF extract restores cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation, indicating that they lack dominant inhibitors of caspase activation. Strikingly, the caspase-9-null MEF extract, but not the APAF-1-null MEF extract, partially or fully restored caspase activation in the resistant cell lines. This suggests that the resistant cell lines have defective APAF-1 activity and intact caspase-9 activity. To confirm the preceding results, we supplemented each resistant cell line with exogenous APAF-1 or caspase-9 and then assessed cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the addition of APAF-1 restored caspase activation in the APAF-1-null MEF extract and in extracts from each of the resistant cell lines. By contrast, the addition of APAF-1 to the caspase-9-null MEF extract failed to restore caspase activation. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the addition of caspase-9 to the caspase-9-null MEF extract restored cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase activation. However, caspase-9 supplementation failed to restore caspase activation in the resistant ovarian extracts or in the APAF-1-null extract. We also supplemented the resistant extracts with a nonphosphorylatable caspase-9 mutant (S196A) because phosphorylation of caspase-9 by the serine/threonine kinase, AKT, can inhibit the activity of the proteinase (12Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Fig. 5 B, although caspase-9 S196A restored caspase activation in the caspase-9-null extract, the proteinase failed to restore caspase activation in the resistant ovarian cell lines or in the APAF-1-null extract. This suggests that caspase-9 phosphorylation does not account for the cytochrome c/dATP resistance of the ovarian cell lines. These data confirm that the resistant ovarian cancer cell lines have intact caspase-9 activity but deficient APAF-1 activity. We next screened the IOSE80, A2780, OCC1, OVCA-432, and SKOV3 cell lines for APAF-1 mutations because this might account for their deficient APAF-1 activity. We amplified APAF-1 cDNAs from each of the cell lines by RT-PCR and then directly sequenced the polymerase chain reaction products to assess them for APAF-1 mutations. We detected both the short (12 WD repeats) and the long (13 WD repeats) APAF-1 isoforms in each of the cell lines and sequenced each isoform in its entirety. Although we detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms in each of the cell lines, no mutations were detected. Thus, APAF-1 loss of function mutations cannot account for the resistant ovarian cancer cell lines defective cytochrome c/dATP-dependent caspase activation. Benedict et al. (18Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) recently showed that the 13-WD repeat APAF-1 isoform activates caspases more efficiently than the 12-WD repeat isoform. Therefore, we next determined the relative expression of each isoform in the cytochromec-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, we detected both isoforms in the NOE35 cell line and in the resistant ovarian cell lines. However, in each case, the 13-WD repeat isoform was more prominently expressed. This suggests that overexpression of the 12-WD repeat APAF-1 isoform does not account for the cytochrome c resistance observed in these cell lines. Because proteasomal degradation can inactivate apoptotic proteins, we examined proteasome-dependent degradation of APAF-1. We did not detect APAF-1 degradation in whole cell extracts from the resistant cell lines even after incubation with ATP and ubiquitin for 4 h at 37 °C (data not shown). We next examined cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis in the ovarian cell lines to determine whether their diminished APAF-1 activity attenuated chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 7, apoptosis resistance only partially correlated with defects in APAF-1 activity. Hey cells, with relatively intact APAF-1 activity (45% DEVDase activity relative to NOE cells (Fig. 2)), were sensitive to both cisplatin- and etoposide-induced apoptosis. By contrast, the OCC1 and SKOV3 cell lines displayed low APAF-1 activity and were also resistant to both drugs. The OVCA-432 cell line was cisplatin-resistant but remained etoposide-sensitive despite diminished APAF-1 activity. Surprisingly, the A2780 cell line remained sensitive to both drugs, although it displayed low APAF-1 activity. Additionally, the IOSE80 cell line, with relatively intact APAF-1 activity, was nevertheless resistant to induction of apoptosis, presumably due to other blocks in the apoptotic pathway. Therefore, APAF-1 activity did not correlate directly with apoptosis sensitivity. To further examine apoptosis induction in A2780 cells, we treated the cells for 48 h with 100 μm etoposide, as above. We detected caspase activation by assessment of DEVDase activity and the cleavage of the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and fodrin (data not shown). Therefore, activation of apoptosis proceeds via caspase activation in these cells despite diminished APAF-1 activity. We next asked whether increasing APAF-1 levels might increase the apoptosis sensitivity of resistant cells. To accomplish this, we transfected SKOV3 cells with pcDNA3-APAF-1XL, selected for populations overexpressing APAF-1, and then assessed caspase activation in vitro and cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Vector control and caspase-9-overexpressing cell populations served as controls. As shown in Fig. 8, although we obtained only ∼2-fold overexpression of APAF-1 in the SKOV3 cells (Fig.8 A), this overexpression restored their cytochromec-dependent caspase activation in vitro (Fig. 8 B) and enhanced their apoptosis in response to cisplatin as assessed after 72 h (Fig. 8 C). Although cell death was increased in the vector-transduced control cells by this time (versus 48 h in Fig. 7), the presence of elevated APAF-1 resulted in enhanced cell death in the transduced cells. In contrast, caspase-9 overexpression failed to restore caspase activation in vitro or to enhance apoptosis in response to cisplatin. The present study demonstrates that ovarian cancer cell line cytosols resist cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation. Although previous studies have shown that cancer cells can resist cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation due to modification or inhibition of caspases (12Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 13Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), our study delineates defective APAF-1 activity as a mechanism of cytochromec-resistance in ovarian cancer lines. Significantly, the diminished APAF-1 activity correlated with apoptosis resistance in a subset of the resistant cell lines. APAF-1 transfection could overcome this apoptosis resistance, suggesting that APAF-1 regulation may be a key mechanism for apoptosis regulation in ovarian cancer. Recently, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT (protein kinase B) pathway has been implicated in ovarian carcinogenesis (20Shayesteh L. Lu Y. Kuo W.-L. Baldocchi R. Godfrey T. Collins C. Pinkel D. Powell B. Mills G.B. Gray J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar), and one way that this pathway may act is via inhibitory phosphorylation of caspase-9 (12Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). However, we found that cytochromec-resistant cell lines had intact caspase-9 activity (Fig.4) and that further supplementation with wild type caspase-9 or a nonphosphorylatable mutant (S196A) did not restore caspase activation (Fig. 5). Elevated levels of phospho (active)-AKT were not detected in the resistant ovarian extracts (data not shown), suggesting that AKT-dependent phosphorylation of caspase-9 does not limit cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation, at least under cell-free conditions. Phosphorylation or other post-translational modification of APAF-1 could potentially inhibit its activity; however, we did not detect altered APAF-1 electrophoretic mobility by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to suggest that it had been modified in the resistant ovarian cancer cells. Similarly, Cardone et al. (12Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Franke T.F. Stanbridge E. Frisch S. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar) did not detect APAF-1 phosphorylation by metabolic labeling of colon cancer cells, suggesting that other mechanisms of APAF-1 regulation occur in cancer cells. Losses of function mutations destroy enzymatic activity and may represent another means for APAF-1 inactivation. However, our study shows expression of only wild type APAF-1 in the five resistant lines examined. Similarly, others (8Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X.

Chaganti R.S.K. Murty V.V.V.S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 28: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown a lack of APAF-1 mutations in a series of malignant tumors including melanomas, lymphomas, teratomas, germ cell tumors, and pancreatic, cervical, and colorectal carcinomas. Although Yamamoto et al. (26Yamamoto H. Gil J. Perucho M. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated APAF-1 mutations in colorectal cancer; this was limited to the subset of tumors exhibiting defects in mismatch repair genes (i.e. the microsatellite mutator phenotype). Because the microsatellite mutator phenotype is not common in ovarian cancer (27Lynch H.T. Casey M.J. Lynch J. White T.E.K. Godwin A.K. Semin. Oncol. 1998; 25: 265-280PubMed Google Scholar), ovarian cancers are not likely to acquire APAF-1 mutations from this mechanism. Besides mutation, altered splicing of APAF-1 influences the protein's activity, with isoforms expressing 12 WD repeats demonstrating diminished cytochromec/dATP-dependent caspase-activating activity (18Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, we detected both 12- and 13-WD repeat APAF-1 isoforms, indicating that restricted isoform expression does not account for diminished APAF-1 activity in ovarian cancer cell lines. Degradation or inhibition of apoptotic proteins can promote apoptosis resistance. Proteosomal degradation of apoptotic proteins represents one mechanism for their inactivation (23Li B. Dou Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3850-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar); however, we found that proteasomal degradation of APAF-1 does not occur in the resistant ovarian lines, suggesting a potential role for APAF-1 inhibitors. Because we could restore APAF-1 activity in the cytochromec-resistant ovarian extracts by mixing them with MEF extracts (Fig. 4) or by adding exogenous APAF-1 (Fig. 5), our data suggest the presence of a nondominant (i.e. competitive) APAF-1 inhibitor. Recently, we (10Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) and others (9Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar) have identified HSPs as inhibitors of APAF-1 activity, and in the case of HSP-70, APAF-1 inhibition occurred in a nondominant fashion. Because induction of HSPs occurs during stress responses and cancer (28Jaattela M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), investigation of potential interactions between APAF-1 and HSPs in ovarian cancer is an important topic for future investigation. Despite diminished APAF-1 activity, apoptosis still proceeded in two of the cell lines, A2780 and OVCA-432 (Fig. 7). In A2780, this apoptosis correlated with increased DEVDase activity and the cleavage of two caspase substrates, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and fodrin, in the expected pattern for caspase cleavage (data not shown). Either the existing low level of APAF-1 activity was still sufficient to drive caspase activation in these cells or alternative pathways for apoptosis were engaged. APAF-1-independent caspase activation and apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells were recently suggested in another study, and it was proposed that these events occurred via activation of caspases by the release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria (30Chauhan D. Hideshima T. Rosen S. Reed J.C. Kharbanda S. Anderson K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24453-24456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Alternatively, DNA damage can induce the expression of Fas (CD95) ligand in a T-cell lymphoma cell line (31Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genesier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and a colon carcinoma line (32Harwood F.G. Kasibhatla S. Petak I. Vernes R. Green D.R. Houghton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10023-10029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), leading to engagement of Fas (CD95) and caspase activation. Apoptosis via Fas or other death receptors can proceed independently of APAF-1 (19Yoshida H. Kong Y.-K. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Deletion or silencing of tumor suppressor genes can abolish expression of their protein products and thereby promote oncogenesis. Although Soengas et al. (8Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X. McCombie R. Herman J.G. Gerald W.L. Lazebnik Y.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) implicated APAF-1 as a tumor suppressor by demonstrating its deletion in metastatic melanoma, we (Fig. 2) and others (18Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8461-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Hahn C. Hirsch B. Jahnke D. Durkop H. Stein S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Murty V.V.V.S. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000; 28: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have not identified APAF-1 deletion in various other cancer cell lines including lines from leukemias, lymphomas, teratomas, germ cell tumors, and pancreatic, cervical, ovarian, and colorectal carcinomas. This suggests that APAF-1 is not a classical tumor suppressor or that other mechanisms exist to abolish APAF-1 activity. Significantly, our study shows that ovarian cancer cell lines generally demonstrate diminished or absent APAF-1 activity compared with NOE cell lines (Fig. 1). This decreased APAF-1 activity correlated in many cases with decreased APAF-1 expression relative to the NOE cell lines (Fig. 2). Furthermore, supplementing cell lines defective in APAF-1 activity restored their cytochromec-dependent caspase activation (Figs. 4 and 5), suggesting that APAF-1 concentration is an important determinant of its activity. Interestingly, overexpression of APAF-1 (but not caspase-9) in SKOV3 cells enhanced their apoptosis in response to cisplatin (Fig.8). Because similar apoptosis sensitization was seen with leukemia and melanoma cells (8Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X. McCombie R. Herman J.G. Gerald W.L. Lazebnik Y.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 29Perkins C. Kim C.N. Fang G. Bhalla K.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4561-4566PubMed Google Scholar), APAF-1 levels may modulate the apoptotic threshold of cancer cells. Therefore, factors that increase APAF-1 levels or enhance APAF-1 activity may hold promise as therapeutic agents for cancer. We thank Drs. Emad Alnemri, John Reed, Gabriel Nunez, and Yuri Lazebnik for reagents and Ruth Lapushin for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2158725585,"TG-interacting factor (TGIF) is a transcriptional repressor, which represses transcription by binding directly to DNA or interacts with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-activated Smads, thereby repressing TGFβ-responsive gene expression. Mutation of TGIF in humans causes holoprosencephaly, a severe genetic disorder affecting craniofacial development. Searching human expressed sequence tag data bases revealed the presence of clones encoding a TGIF-related protein (TGIF2), which contains two regions of high sequence identity with TGIF. Here we show that, like TGIF, TGIF2 recruits histone deacetylase, but in contrast to TGIF, is unable to interact with the corepressor CtBP. TGIF2 and TGIF have very similar DNA-binding homeodomains, and TGIF2 represses transcription when bound to DNA via a TGIF binding site. TGIF2 interacts with TGFβ-activated Smads and represses TGFβ-responsive transcription.

TGIF was identified by its ability to bind to a retinoid-responsive element from the cellular retinol-binding protein II gene, and the preferred DNA sequence to which TGIF binds was identified in vitro (4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Binding of TGIF to the cellular retinol-binding protein II retinoid response element precluded binding of retinoid receptors, resulting in transcriptional repression (4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has demonstrated that Meis2 and TGIF can bind to a similar sequence within the dopamine 1A receptor gene. D1A promoter activity is positively regulated by Meis2d and repressed by TGIF (13Yang Y. Hwang C.K. D'Souza U.M. Lee S.H. Junn E. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20734-20741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that TGIF contains multiple repression domains and can repress transcription by both HDAC-dependent and HDAC-independent mechanisms (14Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). TGIF interacts with HDACs via the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein and contains a PLDLS motif at its amino terminus, which is critical for the recruitment of the corepressor CtBP (carboxyl terminus-binding protein) (14Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39762-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition to repressing transcription when bound to DNA directly via its homeodomain, TGIF can repress TGFβ-activated transcriptional responses (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In response to TGFβ signals, Smad2 and Smad3 are directly phosphorylated by the TGFβ receptor and interact with Smad4, and the activated Smad complex then accumulates within the nucleus (17Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3339) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Derynck R.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 187-192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, a TGFβ-activated Smad complex binds to DNA, either directly or via interactions with other DNA-binding proteins (20Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGFβ-activated Smad complexes activate target gene expression, in part, via interactions with general coactivators such as p300/CBP (21Feng X.-H. Zhang Y. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 22Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

In addition to interactions with coactivators, a nuclear Smad complex is able to interact with specific transcriptional repressors, which act to limit the extent of TGFβ-activated gene expression (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 24Sun Y. Liu X. Eaton E.N. Lane W.S. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Mol.

Stroschein S.L. Wang W. Chen D. Martens E. Zhou S. Zhou Q. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2196-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Smad corepressors such as TGIF and c-Ski or SnoN prevent full activation of TGFβ target genes partly by competing with coactivators for Smad interaction (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 28Wotton D. Massague J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 254: 145-164PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of TGIF with TGFβ-activated Smads displaces coactivators and represses transcription via the recruitment of a corepressor complex, which is likely to include chromatin modifiers, such as histone deacetylases and general corepressors such as the adenovirus E1A-interacting protein, CtBP (15Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39762-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative levels of Smad coactivators and corepressors within the cell may set the magnitude of the transcriptional response to TGFβ. Recent evidence has demonstrated that loss of function mutations in human TGIF result in HPE, a severe genetic disease affecting craniofacial development (29Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30Overhauser J. Mitchell H.F. Zackai E.H. Tick D.B. Rojas K. Muenke M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar). The primary defect in HPE is incomplete cleavage of the ventral forebrain, suggesting that TGIF plays a critical role in early brain development (31Muenke M. Beachy P.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 32Wallis D.E. Muenke M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In most cases, the TGIF mutations associated with HPE are deletion of a single copy of the gene with no loss of heterozygosity, suggesting a haploinsufficient phenotype (29Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30Overhauser J. Mitchell H.F. Zackai E.H. Tick D.B. Rojas K. Muenke M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotypic penetrance ofTGIF mutations is ∼10%, suggesting that other proteins that can compensate for decreased TGIF function may exist. We were, therefore, interested to identify other proteins that may be able to perform similar functions to TGIF. By searching the human EST data base, we identified ESTs encoding a protein with a high degree of identity to the TGIF homeodomain. The gene encoding this protein, termed TGIF2 for TG-interacting factor 2, has recently been characterized and its expression pattern is similar to that ofTGIF (33Imoto I. Pimkhaokham A. Watanabe T. Saito-Ohara F. Soeda E. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Importantly, since TGIF mutations affect brain development, TGIF2 mRNA is expressed in the human brain. However, no functional characterization of the TGIF2 protein has been described. Interestingly, the TGIF2 gene has been shown to be amplified in a proportion of cell lines derived from human ovarian carcinomas (33Imoto I. Pimkhaokham A. Watanabe T. Saito-Ohara F. Soeda E. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This correlates with the finding that, in response to growth stimulatory signals, such as EGF, TGIF is phosphorylated by the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (34Lo R.S. Wotton D. Massague J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation results in increased protein stability, and, in cells with oncogenic Ras mutations, the level of TGIF protein is significantly higher. Thus, increases in both TGIF and TGIF2 expression levels may be associated with tumorigenesis. Here we demonstrate that TGIF2 can perform many of the same functions as TGIF. TGIF2 is a context-independent transcriptional repressor, which acts at least in part by recruiting HDACs but, unlike TGIF, cannot interact with CtBP. TGIF2 can repress transcription when bound directly to DNA and when brought to DNA via interactions with TGFβ-activated Smads. Smad1 and Smad3 were expressed from within pCMV5, and all TGIF and TGIF2 constructs were present within modified pCMV5 vectors containing either a Flag epitope or two HA tags. Flag-HDAC1 and T7-CtBP were as described previously (35Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Renilla luciferase transfection control (pCMV-RL) was obtained from Promega. A3-lux and PF1-luc reporters have been described elsewhere (38Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G.

The TGIF2 clones were generated from an EST (GenBank™ accession no. AW411096). TGIF2 clones were analyzed by automated sequencing on an ABI 377 Prism sequencer. Mink lung epithelial L17 cells were grown in minimal essential medium with nonessential amino acids supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected in 60-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. L17 cells were transfected in six-well plates using DEAE-dextran as described previously (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J.

EGF (10 nm) was added as indicated, and cells were pretreated with 50 µm PD98059 (New England Biolabs) for 30 min prior to EGF addition. L17 cells were cotransfected with the appropriate firefly luciferase reporter and pCMV-RL, and luciferase activity was assayed after 40–48 h. For assays involving TGFβ addition, a TGFβ type I receptor expression vector (37Cárcamo J. Weis F.M.B. Ventura F. Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell.

Firefly luciferase was assayed using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and Renilla luciferase activity was assayed with 0.09 µm coelenterazine (Biosynth) in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. Luciferase activities were assayed using a Berthold LB 953 luminometer. COS-1 cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5% or 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). Following removal of cell debris by centrifugation, lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose and complexes precipitated on Flag-agarose (Sigma), or with protein A-Sepharose and a TGIF-specific rabbit antiserum. After washing, proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Blots were incubated with the appropriate antisera (anti-Flag M2 from Sigma; anti-HA (12CA5) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; anti-T7 tag from Novagen; anti-Smad1 or anti-Smad2/3 from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) and either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce). Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell extracts were treated with 20 units of alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min at 37 °C. Phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate) were included as indicated. Since mutation of TGIF in humans results in HPE with a relatively low penetrance, we wanted to know whether other TGIF-like proteins which might perform similar functions were present. Searching the EST data base revealed several human ESTs, which appeared to encode a protein with a high degree of similarity to the homeodomain of TGIF. We sequenced one of these ESTs (GenBank™ accession no. AW411096) and confirmed the similarity in the DNA binding domain. Recently, cDNAs encoding this protein (termed TGIF2, forTG-interacting factor 2) have been identified, and the TGIF2 gene has been suggested to be amplified in some ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines (33Imoto I. Pimkhaokham A. Watanabe T. Saito-Ohara F. Soeda E. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TGIF and TGIF2 are highly conserved over their homeodomains and contain a 3-amino acid loop extension of identical amino acid sequence, suggesting that protein interactions via the homeodomain are likely to be similar. The third DNA binding helix is essentially identical between TGIF and TGIF2 (Fig. 1). It is, therefore, likely that both proteins will bind to the same DNA sequence. In addition, a region close to the carboxyl terminus of TGIF is highly conserved in TGIF2. This region of TGIF contains two MAP kinase sites, phosphorylation of which increases the half-life of the protein (34Lo R.S. Wotton D. Massague J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the central region of TGIF, which plays a role in interactions with HDACs and with TGFβ-activated Smads, appears to be relatively dissimilar in TGIF2, and the amino-terminal PLDLS motif is absent from TGIF2 (Fig. 1). We created expression vectors encoding TGIF2 with an amino-terminal Flag epitope tag or T7 epitope tag. When transfected into either COS-1 or mink lung epithelial (L17) cells and analyzed by Western blotting, TGIF2 appeared to migrate as two forms of approximately 28 and 30 kDa and the upper band was sometimes further resolved into a closely spaced doublet (see Figs. 2and 4B). Recent evidence has demonstrated that TGIF is phosphorylated at two pairs of MAP kinase sites, and phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal pair of sites in TGIF results in a shift to the slower migrating form of TGIF and increased protein stability (34Lo R.S. Wotton D. Massague J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To determine whether the slower migrating bands represent phosphorylated forms of TGIF2, L17 cells were transfected with Flag-TGIF2 and extracts incubated at 37 °C with alkaline phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 2 A, phosphatase treatment resulted in a loss of the upper form of TGIF2, and this loss was prevented by the presence of phosphatase inhibitors. Thus, the upper TGIF2 bands appear to result from increased phosphorylation. Alteration to valine of either one of the two threonine residues present within the conserved carboxyl-terminal region of TGIF2 resulted in a loss of the slower migrating form of TGIF2 (Fig. 2 B), although with the T182V mutation a band of slightly reduced mobility is visible.Figure 4TGIF2 represses transcription via a TGIF binding site. A, L17 cells were cotransfected with a reporter ((TG)2-TK-luc) in which the luciferase gene is regulated by the HSV TK promoter and two copies of a TGIF binding site (CTGTCAA) and increasing amounts of expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged TGIF, TGIF2, or deletion mutants of TGIF2 (encoding amino acids 1–177 or 1–105). B, relative expression levels of each of the Flag tagged expression constructs used in A were determined by Western blotting (WB) with a Flag antiserum. The relative positions of molecular size markers are shown (49, 36.4, 24.7, 19.2, and 13.1 kDa). Cells were transfected and assayed for luciferase activity as in Fig. 4. Activities are presented in arbitrary units (mean ± S.D. triplicate transfections).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the kinase pathway responsible for this serum-inducible phosphorylation, cells were cotransfected with Flag-TGIF2, together with an expression vector encoding either constitutively active Mek or constitutively active Ras. As shown in Fig. 2 C(lanes 5 and 6), both Ras and Mek expression caused an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated TGIF2 in serum-deprived cells. The addition of EGF also resulted in an increase in the upper form of TGIF2 when compared with serum-deprived cells (Fig. 2 C, lanes 2 and 3), and this effect was blocked by the prior addition of the Mek inhibitor, PD98059 (lane 4). Together, these data suggest that, in response to the EGF-Ras-Mek pathway, TGIF2 is phosphorylated at two MAP kinase sites within the conserved carboxyl-terminal region. TGIF is a context-independent transcriptional repressor, and one of its repression domains (RD-2b) appears to be conserved in TGIF2. To determine whether TGIF2 repressed transcription, we fused the entire coding sequence to the Gal4p DNA binding domain (GBD) and targeted this fusion protein to the HSV TK promoter via multiple Gal4p binding sites. Mink lung epithelial (L17) cells were cotransfected with the (Gal)5-TK-luc reporter and increasing amounts of expression vectors encoding GBD/TGIF2, GBD/TGIF, or GBD alone. When compared with expression of the GBD alone, fusions to both TGIF and TGIF2 resulted in dramatic repression of luciferase activity from this reporter (Fig.3A). In this assay, both TGIF proteins repressed transcription to a similar degree. To identify the region of TGIF2 responsible for this repression, we created a series of GBD/TGIF2 fusions, and each of these fusions was coexpressed in L17 cells with the (Gal)5-TK-luc reporter (Fig. 3 B). GBD/TGIF2-(103–237) repressed transcription to a level similar to that seen with the full-length fusion, suggesting that the TGIF2 repression domain is present in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein. Deletion into this region to amino acid 177 resulted in a small decrease in repression, and further truncation to amino acid 105 almost completely abolished repression (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the transcriptional repression activity of TGIF2 appears to be located between amino acids 103 and 237. The homeodomains of TGIF and TGIF2 are highly conserved, particularly in the third α helix, which is the major DNA-binding helix (Fig. 1). It is, therefore, likely that both proteins bind to the same DNA sequence. To test whether TGIF2 can repress transcription from a TGIF consensus binding site (CTGTCAA; Ref. 4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), L17 cells were cotransfected with TGIF expression constructs and a luciferase reporter ((TG)2-TK-luc) in which transcription is driven by the HSV TK promoter and two copies of a TGIF binding site. As shown in Fig.4 A, both TGIF and TGIF2 repressed transcription from this reporter, although TGIF2 appeared to repress less well than TGIF. The lower level of repression by TGIF2 may be due to lower expression levels of this protein in L17 cells (Fig.4 B) or to an intrinsic difference in the activity of the proteins. Carboxyl-terminal truncation of TGIF2 to either amino acid 177 or 105 resulted in a complete loss of repression (Fig.4 A), despite a high level of expression of the TGIF2-(1–177) construct (Fig. 4 B). Thus, TGIF2 is able to repress transcription when bound to DNA via the homeodomain, and it appears that the conserved carboxyl-terminal region is a major determinant of this repression. TGIF interacts with both histone deacetylases and with the corepressor CtBP (14Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39762-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The PLDLS motif, which is important for the recruitment of CtBP to TGIF, is not conserved in TGIF2. To determine whether TGIF2 interacts with CtBP, COS-1 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding HA-TGIF2 and T7 epitope-tagged CtBP. Immunoprecipitation via the amino-terminal HA epitope appeared to disrupt TGIF-CtBP interaction (data not shown), so immunocomplexes were precipitated using a TGIF-specific antiserum (which recognizes the conserved homeodomain; data not shown). CtBP was clearly detectable in precipitates from cells transfected with HA-TGIF (Fig.5A). In contrast, little CtBP was detected in complexes precipitated via HA-TGIF2 or a mutant form of TGIF in which the PLDLS motif is disrupted (HA-TGIF(S28C)). In addition to CtBP, TGIF interacts with histone deacetylases. To determine whether TGIF2 interacts with HDAC1, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing Flag-HDAC1 and either HA-TGIF2 or HA-TGIF. As shown in Fig. 5 B, TGIF as well as TGIF2 were present in immunocomplexes precipitated via the Flag epitope present on HDAC1. This interaction was specific, as no TGIF2 precipitated in the absence of cotransfected HDAC1. Thus, it appears that TGIF2 interacts with HDAC1 but, consistent with the lack of a PLDLS-like motif, is unable to interact with CtBP. This suggests that the major way in which TGIF2 represses transcription is by recruiting histone deacetylases. TGIF interacts with TGFβ-activated Smads and acts as a Smad transcriptional corepressor (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). We were, therefore, interested to determine whether TGIF2 interacted with the mediator of TGFβ signals, Smad3 (40Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Wu R.-Y. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding Smad3 and Flag-TGIF, Flag-TGIF2, or a control vector. Cells were either treated with TGFβ for 1 h prior to lysis or left untreated. As shown in Fig. 6, Smad3 was clearly detectable in Flag immunoprecipitates from cells expressing either Flag-TGIF or Flag-TGIF2. No Smad3 was visible in control precipitates, and the amount of Smad3 coprecipitating with TGIF or TGIF2 was slightly enhanced by TGFβ treatment. When similar experiments were performed using the BMP-responsive Smad1 (41Graff J.M. Thies R.S. Song J.J. Celeste A.J. Melton D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 169-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), together with a constitutively active BMP type I receptor, no interaction of Smad1 was observed with either TGIF or TGIF2 (Fig. 6). Thus, it appears that both TGIF and TGIF2 interact specifically with Smad3, but not with the BMP pathway-specific Smad1. The above results suggest that, in response to TGFβ signals, TGIF2 interacts with Smad3. To determine the effect of TGIF2 on TGFβ-activated transcriptional responses, L17 cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts of a TGIF2 expression construct, together with the A3-lux reporter and a FAST2 expression vector. A3-lux contains three copies of the activin response element from the Xenopus mix.2 gene (42Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The activin response element is bound by FAST winged helix transcription factors, and when FAST2 is expressed in mammalian cells, luciferase activity from the A3-lux reporter is strongly induced by TGFβ (43Labbé E. Silvestri C. Hoodless P.A. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 44Liu B. Dou C. Prabhu L. Lai E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 45Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7A, increasing expression of TGIF2 resulted in repression of TGFβ-induced activity from the A3-lux reporter. Expression of TGIF2 had no effect on this reporter in the absence of added TGFβ (Fig. 7 B). Repression of A3-lux by TGIF2 was less potent than that observed with TGIF. However, this lower level repression may be due to differences in expression levels of the two TGIF proteins when transfected into L17 cells (see Fig.4 B). To further analyze the effect of TGIF2 on TGFβ-activated transcription, we tested the PF1-luc reporter, in which luciferase gene expression is activated by the TGFβ-inducible element from the PAI-1 promoter (39Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 C, in the presence of TGFβ signaling both TGIF and TGIF2 repressed luciferase activity from this reporter. In this case, the difference in repression by TGIF and TGIF2 appeared to be less significant. Together, these results suggest that TGIF2 interacts with TGFβ-activated Smads and is able to repress the activation of TGFβ-responsive transcription. TGIF is a transcriptional repressor, which can interact with TGFβ-activated Smads and repress expression of TGFβ target genes (16Wotton D. Lo R.S. Lee S. Massague J. Cell. 1999; 97: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). TGIF also binds directly to DNA, thereby repressing a different set of gene responses, independent of TGFβ signals and the Smad proteins (4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 13Yang Y. Hwang C.K. D'Souza U.M. Lee S.H. Junn E. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression by TGIF is dependent on its ability to recruit other transcriptional corepressors, including HDACs and CtBP (14Wotton D. Lo R.S. Swaby L.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37105-37110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39762-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the related protein, TGIF2, is a transcriptional repressor which can work in the same pathways as TGIF and, like TGIF, represses transcription by recruiting HDACs. Mutations in human TGIF result in holoprosencephaly (HPE; Ref. 29Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The primary defect in HPE is in the formation of the ventral forebrain, and this is often associated with disruption of midline facial structures (31Muenke M. Beachy P.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 46Golden J.A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 47Roessler E. Muenke M. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 481-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In general, TGIF mutations in HPE are deletions of one allele, although several missense mutations which result in partial loss of function have been identified (29Gripp K.W. Wotton D. Edwards M.C. Roessler E. Ades L. Meinecke P. Richieri-Costa A. Zackai E.H. Massague J. Muenke M. Elledge S.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 30Overhauser J. Mitchell H.F. Zackai E.H. Tick D.B. Rojas K. Muenke M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, no loss of heterozygosity has been observed, suggesting that relatively small changes in TGIF levels can have dramatic phenotypic outcomes. TGIF mutations are not fully penetrant with respect to the HPE phenotype, and ∼10% of TGIF deletions cause HPE. However, the range and severity of the HPE phenotypes associated with TGIF mutants is similar to that seen with mutations at other HPE loci, such as sonic hedgehog (31Muenke M. Beachy P.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 32Wallis D.E. Muenke M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 48Nanni L. Ming J.E. Bocian M. Steinhaus K. Bianchi D.W. Die-Smulders C. Giannotti A. Imaizumi K. Jones K.L. Campo M.D. Martin R.A. Meinecke P. Pierpont M.E. Robin N.H. Young I.D. Roessler E. Muenke M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2479-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This variability of phenotype and penetrance suggests the presence of genetic modifiers of TGIF function or of other factors that may be able to compensate for decreased TGIF activity. We were, therefore, interested to identify candidate proteins which could perform similar functions to TGIF. Based on the sequence similarity between TGIF and TGIF2, it is to be expected that TGIF2 would bind to a TGIF site. However, outside the homeodomain and a region at their carboxyl termini, the two proteins share little sequence similarity. We show that TGIF2 carries out similar functions to TGIF; TGIF2 appears to be a context-independent transcriptional repressor, which works by recruiting HDAC1. However, TGIF2 lacks the CtBP interaction motif that is present in TGIF, and is unable to interact with CtBP. Thus, it appears that TGIF2 cannot repress transcription via the HDAC-independent mechanism of CtBP recruitment, which may act to target TGIF to certain polycomb group proteins. It is possible that the two modes of repression identified for TGIF (via HDACs or via CtBP) may be important at different locations, or act sequentially at the same genes. Alternatively, both activities may be part of the same general corepressor complex. However, if these two modes of repression have specific functions, perhaps repressing different sets of target genes, TGIF2 would only carry out one of these roles. Thus, TGIF2 may be a specialized form of TGIF, which is dedicated to HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression. In addition to repressing transcription from a cognate TGIF site, TGIF2 interacts with TGFβ-activated Smads and represses transcription of TGFβ-responsive genes. Thus, TGIF2 can repress both TGFβ-dependent and -independent transcription. HPE mutations in TGIF appear to affect its repressor functions. However, we do not know whether such mutations result in HPE due to effects on the TGFβ-dependent roles of TGIF or on other TGFβ-independent functions. Our results suggest that TGIF2 may be able to compensate for the effects of decreased TGIF levels on both TGFβ-dependent and -independent transcriptional regulation. Thus, if there is some variation in expression levels of TGIF2, it is possible that decreased TGIF function may have more severe phenotypic outcomes in some individuals than in others. In this context it should be noted that loss of one TGIF allele might result in less than a 50% reduction in overall TGIF function, since one functional TGIF allele plus two copies of TGIF2will remain. At least 12 separate HPE loci have been mapped, and the genes responsible for the HPE phenotype have been identified at 4 of them (31Muenke M. Beachy P.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 32Wallis D.E. Muenke M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 126-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The human TGIF2 gene is located on chromosome 20q11, a region to which no candidate HPE loci have been mapped (33Imoto I. Pimkhaokham A. Watanabe T. Saito-Ohara F. Soeda E. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, only one of the four HPE missense mutations identified in TGIF alters a residue that is conserved in TGIF2 (P63R, see Fig. 1). It will now be of interest to determine whether decreased TGIF function results in HPE due to effects on TGFβ-activated transcription or on other TGFβ-independent responses. Northern analysis of human TGIF and TGIF2expression demonstrated that both genes are expressed at low levels in adult brain (4Bertolino E. Reimund B. Wildt-Perinic D. Clerc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31178-31188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 33Imoto I. Pimkhaokham A. Watanabe T. Saito-Ohara F. Soeda E. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 49Bertolino E. Wildt S. Richards G. Clerc R.G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization on developing mouse embryos revealed more extensive expression of TGIF transcripts in the brain during embryogenesis (49Bertolino E. Wildt S. Richards G. Clerc R.G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 205: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether TGIF2 is expressed in the developing forebrain. Importantly, our characterization of TGIF2 suggests that loss of a single copy of TGIF may, at least in some tissues, result in an even smaller reduction in overall TGIF function than previously assumed. The fact that HPE mutations are found in TGIF but not in TGIF2 may suggest that the HPE phenotype results from loss of a TGIF-specific function, such as CtBP interaction. In this context, it is of interest that one of the HPE mis-sense mutations found in TGIF specifically prevents interaction with CtBP (15Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39762-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that TGIF may play a more important role in brain development simply due to differences in expression levels or patterns. Phosphorylation of TGIF by the Ras/MAP kinase pathway results in increased protein levels within the cell, due to an increase in the half-life of the protein (34Lo R.S. Wotton D. Massague J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). TGIF2 is also phosphorylated by this pathway, although we have no clear evidence for alterations in TGIF2 stability resulting from phosphorylation. However, it is possible that signal regulated alterations in the level of expression of one or both TGIF proteins may contribute to the variable penetrance of the HPE phenotype. In addition, there may be other effects of MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation on TGIF or TGIF2 function. Recent evidence has suggested that the TGIF2 gene is amplified in certain ovarian tumor-derived cell lines (33Imoto I. Pimkhaokham A. Watanabe T. Saito-Ohara F. Soeda E. Inazawa J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that increased TGIF function may play a role in tumor progression by decreasing the ability of TGFβ signals to prevent cell cycle progression. Indeed, increased expression of TGIF in a human keratinocyte cell line has been shown to interfere with TGFβ-activated expression of the p15Ink4b CDK inhibitor gene, and to decrease TGFβ-induced growth inhibition (34Lo R.S. Wotton D. Massague J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The observed amplification of the TGIF2 gene and concomitant increase in mRNA expression in ovarian tumor cell lines is relatively modest. However, MAP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of TGIF in response to oncogenic Ras results in increased protein stability, thereby increasing steady state levels of TGIF. Thus, amplification of the TGIF2 gene together with effects of Ras activation on TGIF may result in a synergistic increase in overall TGIF levels and activity. It will, therefore, be of interest to determine whether TGIF and TGIF2 protein levels are increased in tumor-derived cell lines. In summary, we have demonstrated that TGIF2 is a transcriptional repressor that can repress transcription when bound directly to DNA, or when recruited by TGFβ-activated Smads. These results raise important questions about the role of both TGIF proteins in brain development and in tumorigenesis. We thank Dr. E. Seto for Flag-HDAC1 and Dr. G. Chinnadurai for T7-CtBP.

https://openalex.org/W2043180327,"We have previously demonstrated that the expression of the soluble extracellular domain of the transmembrane ligand for Notch receptors, Jagged 1 (sJ1), in NIH 3T3 cells results in the formation of a matrix-dependent chord-like phenotype, the loss of contact inhibition of growth, and an inhibition of pro-α1(I) collagen expression. In an effort to define the mechanism by which sJ1 induces this phenotype, we report that sJ1 transfectants display biochemical and cytoskeletal alterations consistent with the activation of Src. Indeed, cotransfection of sJ1 transfectants with a dominant-negative mutant of Src resulted in the loss of matrix-dependent chord formation and correlated with the restoration of type I collagen expression and contact inhibition of growth. We also report that the sJ1-mediated induction of Src activity and related phenotypes, including chord formation, may result from the inhibition of endogenous Jagged 1-mediated Notch signaling since it was not possible to detect an sJ1-dependent induction of CSL-dependent transcription in these cells. Interestingly, NIH 3T3 cells transfected with dominant-negative (but not constitutively active) mutants of either Notch 1 orNotch 2 displayed a similar Src-related phenotype as the sJ1 transfectants. These data suggest that the ability of sJ1 to mediate chord formation is Src-dependent and requires the repression of endogenous Jagged 1-mediated Notch signaling, which is tolerant to the destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton, a mediator of cell migration. We have previously demonstrated that the expression of the soluble extracellular domain of the transmembrane ligand for Notch receptors, Jagged 1 (sJ1), in NIH 3T3 cells results in the formation of a matrix-dependent chord-like phenotype, the loss of contact inhibition of growth, and an inhibition of pro-α1(I) collagen expression.

These data suggest that the ability of sJ1 to mediate chord formation is Src-dependent and requires the repression of endogenous Jagged 1-mediated Notch signaling, which is tolerant to the destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton, a mediator of cell migration. soluble Jagged 1 constitutively active Notch dominant-negative Notch full-length Jagged 1 fibroblast growth factor phosphate-buffered saline chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Notch receptors are transmembrane polypeptides that regulate cell fate determination and whose activities are critical for a wide variety of developmental and physiological processes (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

Notchgenes have been found in all invertebrate and vertebrate species examined to date, with four Notch genes (Notch 1–4) expressed in mice, rats, and humans (3del Amo F.F. Gendron-Maguire M.

Notch ligands are also evolutionarily conserved transmembrane polypeptides that are divided into Delta-like or Serrate-like subclasses based on the absence or presence, respectively, of an extracellular cysteine-rich region located N-terminal to the transmembrane domain (7Weinmaster G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Four Delta-like (Delta 1–4) and twoSerrate-like (Jagged 1 and 2) genes have thus far been identified in vertebrates (8Gray G.E. Mann R.S. Mitsiadis E. Henrique D. Carcangiu M.L. Banks A. Leiman J.

Notch ligands were previously thought to function exclusively as membrane-bound polypeptides that interact directly with Notch through cell-cell contact (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4896) Google Scholar, 2Miele L. Osborne B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, biochemical evidence has shown that Kuzbanian, an ADAM (adisintegrinand metalloprotease domain) family extracellular metalloprotease genetically linked to theDrosophila Notch null neurogenic phenotype, cleaves the Drosophila Notch ligand Delta near the transmembrane domain, potentially turning Delta into a soluble ligand (11Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). No proteases that cleave Serrate/Jagged ligands have been identified thus far, although mRNA representing human Jagged 1 lacking the transmembrane and intracellular domains has been detected in human endothelial cells (12Zimrin A.B.

To date, it is still unclear as to whether the soluble forms of the human Notch ligands inhibit or activate Notch signaling pathways (14Hukriede N.A. Gu Y. Fleming R.J.

We have previously reported that mRNA representing both the full-length and soluble, non-transmembrane forms of the Notch ligandJagged 1 was up-regulated in human endothelial cells during the fibrin-mediated pathway of in vitro angiogenesis (12Zimrin A.B. Pepper M.S. McMahon G.A. Nguyen F. Montesano R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32499-32502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Indeed, Jagged 1 expression is mandatory for normal blood vessel formation since embryonic mice are not viable beyond stage embryonic day 10.5 in a Jagged 1 null situation, presumably as a result of massive hemorrhage associated with malformation of the vasculature (20Xue Y. Gao X. Lindsell C.E. Norton C.R. Chang B. Hicks C. Gendron-Maguire M. Rand E.B. Weinmaster G. Gridley T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). During studies to define the role of Jagged 1 signaling in angiogenesis, we noted prominent phenotypic alterations in cells stably transfected with a naturally occurring and secreted form of Jagged 1 lacking the transmembrane and intracellular domains (21Wong M.K. Prudovsky I. Vary C. Booth C. Liaw L. Mousa S. Small D. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Indeed, stable soluble Jagged 1 (sJ1)1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants exhibit a wide range of biochemical, morphological, and behavioral changes that include loss of pro-α1(I) collagen expression, decreased sensitivity to contact inhibition, and the matrix-dependent formation of chord-like structures (21Wong M.K. Prudovsky I. Vary C. Booth C. Liaw L. Mousa S. Small D. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a morphologic characteristic reminiscent of the early-to-mid stage phenotype exhibited during the pathway of human endothelial cell differentiation (22Maciag T. Kadish J. Wilkins L. Stemerman M.B. Weinstein R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The role of Jagged 1 as an angiogenic factor was further substantiated by the observation that the implantation of lethally irradiated sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants in the conventional chorioallantoic membrane assay induced the growth of neovessels (21Wong M.K. Prudovsky I. Vary C. Booth C. Liaw L. Mousa S. Small D. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In an effort to elucidate the signaling mechanisms responsible for the sJ1-inducible chord-like phenotype, we examined the role of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in this system. We report that sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants demonstrate a pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation indicative of an increase in the activity of Src, and the expression of a dominant-negative form of Src in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants was able to revert matrix-dependent chord formation, including a down-regulation of F-actin stress fibers, an observation consistent with the activation of Src (23Mayer B.J. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment with amlexanox, an agent known to repress cell migration and attenuate the F-actin cytoskeleton (24Landriscina M. Prudovsky I. Carreira C.M. Soldi R. Tarantini F. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32753-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was unable to repress chord-formation, suggesting that cell migration is not requisite for chord formation in vitro. Furthermore, we found that the Src-dependent phenotype exhibited by sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants most likely results from inhibition of endogenous Jagged 1-mediated Notch signaling, as NIH 3T3 cells expressing the dominant-negative extracellular and soluble portions (but not the intracellular and constitutively active mutants) of Notch 1 and Notch 2 exhibit phenotypic changes similar to those observed in sJ1 transfectants. Insert-less pMEXneo and sJ1 constructs and stable NIH transfectants were obtained as previously described (21Wong M.K. Prudovsky I. Vary C. Booth C. Liaw L. Mousa S. Small D. Maciag T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 853-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TheJagged 1 construct was obtained by cloning the complete coding region from a cDNA clone previously isolated in our laboratory (12Zimrin A.B. Pepper M.S. McMahon G.A. Nguyen F. Montesano R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32499-32502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) into the pcDNA3.1+ neomycin-resistant vector (Invitrogen) using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites to produce the plasmid pFLJ1G418. The constitutively active and dominant-negative Notch 1 (caN1 and dnN1, respectively) constructs tagged with a V5/His epitope were obtained by first modifying the stop codon of the cDNA encoding human Notch 1 (a generous gift of T. Kadesch, University of Pennsylvania) to an EcoRI site by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The entireNotch 1 coding region was then cloned into the pcDNA4.0V5/His version a vector (Invitrogen) to produce the plasmid pFLN1V5/His. The caN1 construct was obtained by inserting an EcoRI site into the coding region of this tagged, full-length Notch 1 construct immediately upstream of the first Met residue (amino acid 1807) in the cytoplasmic domain of the Notch 1 polypeptide (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberM73980). The cDNA encoding the entire cytoplasmic domain minus the stop codon of pFLN1V5/His was then excised with the restriction enzymesEcoRI and EcoRV and cloned into theEcoRI and NheI sites of the pcDNA4.0V5/His version a vector to produce the caN1 construct with a V5/His tag (pCAN1V5). The dnN1 construct was also obtained using site-directed mutagenesis to produce another EcoRI site immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain (amino acids 1528) in pFLN1V5/His. The cDNA representing Notch 1 (amino acids 1–1528) was then cloned into the pcDNA4.0V5/His version a vector using theEcoRI site to produce the dnN1 construct with a V5/His tag (pDNN1V5/His). The V5/His-tagged constitutively active Notch 2 (caN2) construct was obtained using site-directed mutagenesis to change the stop codon in a plasmid encoding the cytoplasmic domain of human Notch 2 (phN2IC, a generous gift from S. Artavanis-Tsakonas, Harvard University) to an EcoRI site, and the cDNA representing the entire cytoplasmic domain was then cloned into theBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pcDNA4.0V5/His version b vector to produce the plasmid pCAN2V5/His. The dnN2 construct was obtained by introducing anXhoI site into the coding region of phN2-complete (a generous gift from S. Artavanis-Tsakonas) immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain and excised with EcoRI andXhoI to release a fragment representing the extracellular domain (amino acids 1–1676; sequence map obtained from S. Artavanis-Tsakonas). This fragment was then cloned into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA4.0V5/His version b vector to produce pDNN2V5/His. Stable NIH 3T3 transfectants expressing full-length Jagged 1 (flJ1), caN1, caN2, dnN1, and dnN2 were generated as previously described (25Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clonal transfectants were selected using the appropriate antibiotic (G418 (1 mg/ml) for flJ1 and Zeocin (150 µg/ml) for the Notch mutants) using standard methods previously described (25Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clonal transfectants were screened for expression using antibodies against the C terminus of Jagged 1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for flJ1 transfectants or against the V5/His epitope (Invitrogen) for the Notch mutants. At least two positive clones for each line were initially typed for phenotype. Clones flJ1–5, caN1-A, caN2-L, dnN1–7, and dnN2-2 were used for the experiments presented in this report. For the generation of the dominant-negative Src-sJ1 cotransfectants, the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (clone 38.1) were cotransfected with a dominant-negative mutant of Xenopus laevis Srcin which lysine 294 was replaced by alanine and tyrosine 526 by phenylalanine. The dominant-negative Src mutant was cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ hygromycin vector (Invitrogen) usingXhoI and XbaI restriction sites, and the selection of stable transfectants was performed as previously described (25Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control transfection was performed using the insert-less pcDNA3.1+ hygromycin vector. The expression of the dominant-negative Src construct was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis using twoSrc primers: the forward primer encompassing nucleotides 72–90 of the X. laevis Src cDNA was X. laevis Src-specific, and the reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 453–470 was common for both X. laevis and murine Src. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates with anti-Src2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Clone dn3 representing the dominant-negativeSrc-sJ1NIH 3T3 cell cotransfectants was used for these studies. The stable NIH 3T3 transfectants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 µg/ml Fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the appropriate antibiotic as determined by the resistance of the expression construct. Cells were made quiescent by incubating the confluent monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25% (v/v) bovine calf serum for 24 h and further stimulated for an additional 24 h by the addition of 10 µg/ml heparin (The Upjohn Co.) and 10 ng/ml recombinant human FGF-1, prepared as previously described (26Imamura T.

Immunoprecipitation of cortactin was performed as described (27LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and immunoblot analysis of total phosphotyrosine, total Src, and phosphotyrosine-specific Src (Tyr(P)418) was carried out using antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz Biotechnology, andBioSource, International, respectively, following methods previously described (27LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Pro-α1(I) collagen (monoclonal antibody SP1.D8 from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) and cortactin (28Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) immunoblot analyses used similar methods. Amlexanox (AAl673, Takeda Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in equimolar NaOH as described (29Carreira C.M. LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Lathrop J.T. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22224-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the Src inhibitors PP2 (Calbiochem) and PD0180970 (Parke-Davis) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Fluorescence staining was performed as previously described (27LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on glass coverslips. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at 25 °C, and the monolayers were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.1% (w/v) NaN3(blocking buffer) for 1 h. For F-actin staining, the NaN3 monolayer was washed with PBS three times, incubated for 20 min with 0.1 µg/ml rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma), washed three times with PBS, and embedded in 50% (v/v) glycerol containing 0.1% (w/v) phenylenediamine. Cells were studied using a Leica TCS-SP fluorescent confocal microscope, and pictures of optical sections most abundant in fluorescent F-actin were recorded. To study substrate-dependent chord formation, cells were plated on cell culture dishes with and without type I collagen. Collagen gels were formed in six-well cell culture dishes by mixing type I collagen (Becton Dickinson), 10× PBS, 1 n NaOH, and sterile distilled water at a 2.5:1:0.06:6.5 (v/v) ratio on ice and then quickly dispensing (1.5 ml) into the individual wells. The collagen mixture was allowed to gel for 1 h prior to use. For studies involving cell migration, confluent monolayers were scraped, and the response to injury was recorded by phase-contrast microscopy as previously described (27LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell growth was examined by plating cells in complete cell culture medium on fibronectin-coated dishes (10 µg/cm2) at an initial density of 2 × 104 (see Fig. 4B) or 4 × 104 (see Fig. 2C) cells/well. Cell numbers were monitored every 2 days by trypsin/EDTA cell detachment and quantitation using a hemocytometer as described (21Wong M.K. Prudovsky I. Vary C. Booth C. Liaw L. Mousa S. Small D.

Insert-less pMEXneo (panel a), sJ1 (panel b) and dominant-negativeSrc-sJ1 (panel c) NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were plated on type I collagen prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and examined 24 h after incubation by phase-contrast microscopy (magnification × 20). B, the cotransfection of dominant-negative Src restores the expression of pro-α1(I) collagen in sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. The lysates from insert-less pMEXneo, sJ1 (clones 38.1 and 38.4), and dominant-negative Src-sJ1 (dnSrc: sJ1) NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were prepared and immunoblotted for pro-α1(I) collagen as described under “Experimental Procedures.”C, the expression of dominant-negative Srcdecreases the saturation density of sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectant growth. The growth dynamics of insert-less pMEXneo, sJ1, and dominant-negative Src-sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are reported as viable cell number as a function of time, and 4 × 104 cells were seeded per dish. Error barsrepresent S.E. D, amlexanox does not suppress the type I collagen-dependent chord formation by sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. Insert-less vector pMEXneo (panels a andc) and sJ1 (panels b and d) NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were plated in the presence (panels c andd) and absence (panels a and b) of 0.3 mm amlexanox on type I collagen prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and examined after 24 h of incubation by phase-contrast microscopy (magnification × 20).E, the expression of dominant-negative Src in sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants does not alter their impaired migratory ability. Insert-less pMEXneo, sJ1, and dominant-negativeSrc-sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were analyzed using the response-to-injury model of cell migration as described (27LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A.

Phase-contrast photomicrographs (magnification × 10) are shown at the times indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All cells used in this assay were plated onto fibronectin-coated 12-well tissue culture dishes and transiently transfected at 70% confluency with the specific constructs indicated using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the CBF1 reporter assay, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of a luciferase construct driven by four tandem copies of theCBF1response element (30Hsieh J.J. Henkel T. Salmon P. Robey E. Peterson M.G. Hayward S.D. Mol. Cell.

All cells were also transfected with 100 ng of the RenillaSV40 construct (Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum 24 h after transfection. The cells were harvested 24 h after the media change, and luciferase/Renilla activity was measured using the Promega dual-luciferase reporter assay system. The efficiency of transcription was measured and normalized in relationship to the activity of pRL-Renilla SV40, and activity was reported as the ratio of luciferase to Renilla activity. Error bars represent S.E. All samples were performed in triplicate for each experiment, and the experiments were performed a minimum of three times. For the HES1 reporter assay, insert-less pMEXneo, flJ1, sJ1, caN1, dnN1, caN2, and dnN2 stable NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were transiently transfected with 500 ng of a CAT reporter driven by the region of the HES1 promoter encompassing nucleotides −194 to +160 (31Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) and 500 ng of the caN1 construct. Cells were also transfected with 100 ng of the cytomegalovirus-luciferase construct (pGL3-Control, Promega) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum 24 h after transfection. The cells were harvested 24 h after the media change, and CAT and luciferase activities were measured using thePromega CAT reporter enzyme assay system and luciferase assay kit, respectively. Activity was reported as the ratio of CAT to luciferase activity. Error bars represent S.E. All samples were performed in triplicate for each experiment, and the experiments were performed a minimum of three times. In an attempt to elucidate the potential role of tyrosine kinases as possible mediators of sJ1-dependent function, the protein tyrosine phosphorylation profiles of whole cell lysates obtained from insert-less pMEXneo and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants were examined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the steady-state levels of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were significantly different between the insert-less vector and sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. Interestingly, we observed the presence of two prominent phosphotyrosine-containing polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of ∼60 and 80 kDa in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants (Fig. 1 A). Immunoblot analysis of these lysates using an anti-Src phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (Src pY 418) enabled us to determine that the 60-kDa polypeptide represented the phosphotyrosine signature of activated Src (Fig.1 A, lower panel). Likewise, cortactin immunoprecipitation followed by phosphotyrosine and cortactin immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 B) enabled us to determine that the 80-kDa polypeptide represented the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the Src substrate- and F-actin-binding protein cortactin (29Carreira C.M.

In addition, although the intracellular levels of cortactin did not vary significantly in response to either FGF-1, a known inducer of Src-dependent cortactin phosphorylation (29Carreira C.M. LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Lathrop J.T. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol.

Toledo L.M. Zhao H. Morgenstern K.A. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we observed an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in quiescent sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants, which was further exaggerated by FGF-1 stimulation and repressed by the addition of PP2 (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is enhanced in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants. To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the sJ1 NIH 3T3 cell transfectants was functional, we examined these cells for the presence of F-actin stress fibers.

The molecular basis of the defects is not understood but presumably relates to the DNA helicase and exonuclease activities of the protein encoded by the WRN gene that is mutated in the disease. The attenuation of p53-mediated apoptosis in WS cells and reported physical interaction between WRN and the tumor suppressor p53 suggest that p53 and WRN functionally interact in a pathway necessary for the normal cellular response. In this study, we have demonstrated that p53 inhibits the exonuclease activity of the purified full-length recombinant WRN protein. p53 did not have an effect on a truncated amino-terminal WRN fragment that retains exonuclease activity but lacks the physical interaction domain for p53 located in the carboxyl terminus. Two naturally occurring p53 mutants found in human cancer displayed a reduced ability to inhibit WRN exonuclease activity. In cells arrested in S phase with hydroxyurea, WRN exits the nucleolus and colocalizes with p53 in the nucleoplasm. The regulation of WRN function by p53 is likely to play an important role in the maintenance of genomic integrity and prevention of cancer and other clinical symptoms associated with WS.

Loss of p53 function results in genomic instability, a key feature of carcinogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4523) Google Scholar) (2Bennett M.R.

Key components of checkpoint control mediated by p53 include arrest of cell cycle progression, inhibition of DNA replication, and activation of DNA repair. A DNA damage signaling pathway leads to elevated p53, which up-regulates transcription of a number of genes including the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (4Kastan M.B. Zhan Q. el-Deiry W.S.

The precise molecular roles of the WRN protein are not known but presumably relate to DNA metabolic pathways that influence genome integrity. A number of recent findings suggest that p53 and WRN proteins function together to maintain genomic stability: (a) p53-mediated apoptosis is attenuated in WS cells (18Spillare E.A. Robles A.I.

In support of a molecular interaction between WRN and p53, two groups have reported a physical interaction between the proteins (18Spillare E.A. Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Shen J.C., Yu, C.E.

Despite the strong evidence that WRN and p53 associate with each other, there has been no evidence for a functional biochemical interaction between WRN and p53. The p53-WRN physical interaction suggests that the phenotypes of cancer and genomic instability in WS may involve p53 modulation of WRN catalytic function. To investigate the relationship of p53 and WRN protein, we have analyzed whether the ATPase, helicase, and exonuclease activities of WRN are modulated by p53. Our results demonstrate that p53 exerts a strong inhibitory effect on the exonuclease activity of WRN. The regulation of WRN by p53 is relevant to the important roles of these proteins in the maintenance of genome stability. Baculovirus constructs for a recombinant hexa-histidine-tagged full-length WRN protein or a truncated version of WRN (amino-terminal 368 amino acids, designated N-WRN) were kindly provided by Dr. Matthew Gray (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Amplified baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 insect cells for overexpression and purification of WRN protein as described elsewhere (22Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A.

Wild-type and mutant p53 proteins (R273H and R249S) used in WRN catalytic assays were purified as described previously (24Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z.

Exonuclease III was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. DNA polymerase I (Klenow) was from New England Biolabs. The rabbit polyclonal antibody against WRN protein and the mouse monoclonal antibody against p53 were from Novus Biologicals. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs. M13mp18 ssDNA was from New England Biolabs. The 28-mer oligonucleotide was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. with the following sequence: 5′-ATGCTGATGCAAATCCAATCGCAAGACA-3′.

[3H]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech , and [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The DNA exonuclease substrate consisted of a double-stranded DNA molecule with one blunt end and one recessed 3′ end (5′ overhang of 20 nucleotides) (see Fig. 1 A). To prepare the substrate, single-stranded 53-mer oligonucleotides (7 pmol) were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (60 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase (10 units) using the manufacturer's recommended conditions. The labeled oligomers were mixed with a 2-fold excess of the complementary 73-mer oligonucleotide in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm MgCl2, heated together at 90 °C for 5 min, and then cooled slowly (∼3 h) to 25 °C. Annealed double-stranded DNA substrates were separated from unannealed ssDNA oligomers by nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Intact double-stranded DNA substrate fragments were recovered using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and stored at 4 °C.Figure 1Inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity by p53.

The 28-mer oligonucleotide was labeled at its 5′ end as described above and annealed to M13mp18 ssDNA circle. Partial duplex DNA substrates were purified by gel filtration column chromatography using Bio-Gel A-5M resin (Bio-Rad). Exonuclease assay reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm ATP, and either WRN full-length recombinant protein (16 nm) or the N-WRN truncated fragment (29 nm). For those reactions containing wild-type p53 or R249S or R273H mutant p53, the concentrations are indicated in the figure legend. The amount of the double-stranded exonuclease substrate in the reaction mixture was ∼3 fmol. Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN protein and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (80% formamide, 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The digestion products of these reactions were separated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmATP, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and the indicated concentration of WRN protein. For those reactions containing p53, the concentrations are indicated. The concentration of the 28-bp partial duplex helicase substrate in the reaction mixture was ∼2 μm (nucleotide phosphate). Reactions were incubated at 24 °C for 60 min and terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.9% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol. The products of helicase reactions were resolved on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled DNA species in polyacrylamide gels were visualized using a PhosphorImager or film autoradiography and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The percentage of helicase substrate unwound was calculated by the following formula: % displacement = 100 ×P/(S + P). P is the product, and S is the substrate. The values for Pand S have been corrected after subtracting the background values in the no enzyme and heat-denatured controls, respectively. ATPase assay reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 4 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, M13mp18 ssDNA (30 μm nucleotide phosphate), 0.8 mm[3H]ATP (42 cpm/pmol), 138 nm WRN protein (monomer), and the indicated amounts of p53. Reactions were initiated by the addition of WRN protein and incubated at 24 °C. Samples (5 μl) were removed at 2-min intervals and evaluated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (25Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14009-14016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less than 20% of the substrate ATP was consumed in the reaction over the entire time course of the experiment. The kinetic rate constant (kcat) values were expressed as the mean of at least three independent experiments. DNA binding was monitored by gel shift analysis. Solution conditions for DNA binding were essentially the same as those conditions used for the exonuclease assays. Briefly, 3 fmol of the 32P-labeled double-stranded exonuclease substrate were incubated for 10 min on ice with 12.5 ng of wild-type p53, p53-R249S, or p53-R273H proteins in buffer containing 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm ATP. DNA-protein mixtures (10 μl each) were analyzed by native 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. DNA was visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Far Western blotting analysis was conducted essentially as described previously (26Brosh R.M.J. Li J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, 0.2–1.0 μg of each polypeptide was electrophoresed on 8–16% acrylamide Tris-glycine gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Filters were immersed twice in denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl in phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min followed by six 10-min washes in serial dilutions (1:1) of denaturation buffer supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol. Filters were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% powdered milk and 0.3% Tween 20 for 30 min before incubation with p53 (0.5 μg/ml) in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.25% powdered milk, 0.3% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 60 min. Filters were washed four times (10 min each) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.3% Tween 20 and 0.25% powdered milk. The second wash contained 0.0001% glutaraldehyde. Conventional Western analysis was then performed to detect the presence of p53 using mouse monoclonal antibody against p53 (Novus Biologicals; 1:500) as primary antibody. Anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Vector Laboratories) was used as secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution and detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. U2OS cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) derived from a human osteogenic sarcoma that contains wild-type p53 and p53-null SAOS-2 cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SV40-transformed normal human skin cell line GM00637D fibroblasts and WRN−/−-transformed human AG11395 fibroblasts were grown in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% vitamin, and 1% amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown on coverslips to a density of 105 cells/ml. After 24 h, HU (Sigma) was added to the cells to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the cells were incubated for 5 h. The cells were fixed with 2% freshly prepared paraformaldehye (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm glycine (Aldrich). The cells were subsequently permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 20 min, followed by three washes with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. WRN, p53, and nucleolin (C23) proteins were detected immunologically by incubating the coverslips with the appropriate antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. For simultaneous detection of WRN and p53, rabbit polyclonal antibody against WRN (1:1000; Novus Biologicals) and mouse monoclonal antibody against p53 (1:500; Novus Biologicals) were used. For simultaneous detection of WRN and nucleolin (C23), the mouse monoclonal antibody against C23 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against WRN (as described above) were used. After washing three times (10 min each) with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and 0.1% BSA, the coverslips were incubated simultaneously with donkey anti-rabbit Texas Red (1:200; Jackson Laboratories) and donkey anti-mouse CY2 (1:500; Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times (10 min each), the coverslips were mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed under a laser scan confocal microscope (Zeiss 410) in separate channels (green, 488 nm; red, 568 nm). The images were then overlaid and analyzed with Metamorp imaging system 4.1 (Universal Imaging Corp.). Immunofluorescence experiments were repeated at least three times. Approximately 30 cells were analyzed for each treatment, and representative photographs are shown. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that WRN protein functionally interacts with p53. It was previously shown that the carboxyl terminus of p53 (18Spillare E.A. Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Shen J.C., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Blander G. Kipnis J. Leal J.F., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29463-29469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) interacts with the carboxyl terminus of WRN. However, a functional biochemical interaction between the proteins has not been reported. The effect of p53 protein on WRN exonuclease, helicase, and ATPase activities was tested. We first tested the effect of p53 on WRN exonuclease activity using a duplex DNA substrate containing a recessed 3′ end (Fig.1 A). This substrate is efficiently degraded by WRN protein in a 3′ to 5′ direction (Fig.1 B). The exonuclease activity of WRN protein (16 nm monomer) was effectively inhibited by p53 at concentrations as low as 12 nm p53 monomer (Fig. 1,B and C). The inhibition of WRN 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity was p53 dose-dependent, with maximal inhibition achieved at the highest p53 concentration tested (71 nm monomer), an ∼4:1 molar ratio of p53 monomer to WRN monomer (Fig. 1, B and C). From multiple experiments using different preparations of recombinant wild-type WRN protein and p53, we consistently observed a 2-fold or greater increase in labeled oligonucleotides ranging in size from 49–53 nucleotides for those WRN exonuclease reactions conducted in the presence of p53 (71 nm) compared with reactions in which p53 was omitted. In these experiments, the effect of p53 on WRN exonuclease activity resulted in attenuated degradation, yielding a population of products of greater size compared with those obtained from WRN exonuclease reactions lacking p53 (Fig. 1 C). Maximal p53 inhibition resulted in an increase in full-length oligonucleotide (53-mer) or oligonucleotides slightly shorter (by 1–5 nucleotides) than the full-length 53-mer, depending on p53 concentration and exonuclease activity of WRN protein preparations. The enrichment of larger-sized products was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the faster-migrating species (shorter labeled fragments) (Fig. 1,B and C). Quantitative analysis of the products from WRN exonuclease experiments containing only WRN (16 nm monomer) indicated that 29% of the DNA substrate was ≥52-mer (Fig. 1 C). In the presence of WRN (16 nm monomer) and increasing p53 concentrations (12, 24, 35, and 71 nm monomer), the percentage of oligonucleotides ≥ 52-mer increased progressively to 35%, 43%, 53%, and 66%, respectively. p53 preferentially binds to ssDNA ends (90% of total binding) (27Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Kiseleva E. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of p53 on WRN exonuclease activity may be due to a direct protein interaction with WRN or binding to the termini of the DNA substrate itself, preventing the loading of WRN protein onto the DNA substrate. Alternatively, p53 may prevent the initiation of the WRN exonuclease reaction. In contrast to its effect on WRN exonuclease, p53 was unable to affect the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of either exonuclease III (Fig.2 A) or DNA polymerase I (Klenow) (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the ability of p53 to inhibit digestion is specific to WRN exonuclease. To address the mechanism of p53 inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity, we measured the effect of p53 on a truncated recombinant WRN protein (residues 1–368) designated N-WRN that lacks the ATPase/helicase domain and the carboxyl terminus but retains the exonuclease motif (Fig. 3 A). This N-WRN recombinant fragment is an active exonuclease that degrades with a 3′ to 5′ directionality (Fig. 3 B ) (17Huang S. Beresten S. Li B. Oshima J. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The presence of p53 did not have an effect on the exonuclease activity of the truncated WRN protein (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that p53 inhibits the exonuclease activity of the full-length recombinant WRN protein by a direct protein interaction with a region other than the amino-terminal 368 amino acids of WRN. To further address the mapping of the WRN-p53 interaction, far Western analysis was performed. For this, full-length WRN protein, N-WRN (residues 1–368), and C-WRN (residues 940–1432) (Fig. 3 A) were immobilized on a PVDF membrane, which was then incubated with purified recombinant p53 protein. The membrane was then washed to remove unbound protein, and the presence of p53 was detected by conventional Western blotting. As controls, the membrane also contained BSA and p53 itself. In addition, a second membrane containing the same proteins was prepared and incubated in buffer alone. The anti-p53 antibody detected a band at the position of the carboxyl-terminal WRN fragment as well as at the position of the full-length WRN protein (Fig. 4). However, the amino-terminal WRN fragment was not detected by this far Western analysis. These results are consistent with a previous report that the p53-binding domain of WRN protein resides within the carboxyl-terminal 419 residues of WRN (19Blander G. Kipnis J. Leal J.F., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29463-29469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These physical interaction data, together with our results from the exonuclease studies, suggest (but do not prove) that p53 inhibits the exonuclease activity of the full-length WRN protein by a direct protein interaction with a carboxyl-terminal region that resides after the amino-terminal domain of WRN that harbors the exonuclease activity. The ability of p53 to modulate WRN exonuclease activity is the first demonstration of a direct biochemical functional interaction between the proteins. The critical role of p53 in maintaining genome integrity in mammalian cells may be related to its biochemical interaction with the WRN protein. The mutational status of p53 may influence its ability to affect WRN exonuclease function. To explore this issue further, we tested two naturally occurring p53 mutants (R273H and R249S) found in human cancer for their ability to modulate the exonuclease activity of WRN. R273H and R249S are p53 hot spot missense mutations that reside in the core domain for sequence-specific DNA binding (residues102–290) (29Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 30Halazonetis T.D. Kandil A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). It was consistently observed that the 3′-recessed duplex substrate used for exonuclease studies was degraded more extensively by WRN in the presence of either the R273H or R249S p53 mutant proteins compared with wild-type p53 protein (Fig.5, A and B). Scan analysis of products resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels demonstrated that the maximal product peak of the WRN exonuclease reaction was shifted farther from the origin for the R249S and R273H mutant proteins compared with wild-type p53 (Fig. 5 B). Quantitative analysis of the products from WRN exonuclease experiments containing only WRN (16 nm monomer) indicated that 24% of the DNA substrate was ≥49-mer (Fig. 5 B). In the presence of WRN (16 nm monomer) and wild-type R249 and R273 p53 proteins (24 nm monomer), the percentage of oligonucleotides ≥ 49-mer was 39%, 25%, and 28%, respectively. Thus, both p53 mutant proteins were less effective as inhibitors of WRN exonuclease activity than wild-type p53. These results suggest that the region of p53 containing the R249S and R273H mutations, which were previously shown to be important in DNA binding (33Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), plays a role in the modulation of WRN exonuclease activity. To explore the DNA binding status of the p53 proteins, we tested wild-type and mutant p53 proteins for binding to the DNA substrate used for the exonuclease studies by gel shift experiments. Wild-type p53 protein was able to bind the exonuclease DNA substrate as detected by a shift of the free substrate to a specific retarded species on native polyacrylamide gels; however, both the R273H and R249S p53 mutant proteins failed to bind the DNA substrate (Fig. 6). The faint intermediate species in the lane corresponding to the R249S p53 mutant was not reproducibly observed in any of the p53-substrate DNA binding experiments. These data suggest that DNA binding by p53 contributes to the inhibition of WRN exonuclease activity on the 3′-recesse"

A., and Papazian, D. M. (1994)Biochemistry 33, 5607–5613). We have now investigated whether glycosylation increases the stability, cell surface expression, and proper folding of Shaker protein expressed in mammalian cells. The turnover rates of wild-type protein and an unglycosylated mutant (N259Q,N263Q) were compared in pulse-chase experiments. The wild-type protein was stable, showing little degradation after 48 h. In contrast, the unglycosylated mutant was rapidly degraded (t12 = ∼18 h). Lactacystin slowed the degradation of the mutant protein, implicating cytoplasmic proteasomes in its turnover. Rapid lactacystin-sensitive degradation could be conferred on wild-type Shaker by a glycosylation inhibitor. Expression of the unglycosylated mutant on the cell surface, assessed using immunofluorescence microscopy and biotinylation, was dramatically reduced compared with wild type. Folding and assembly were analyzed by oxidizing intersubunit disulfide bonds, which provides a fortuitous hallmark of the native structure. Surprisingly, formation of disulfide-bonded adducts was quantitatively similar in the wild-type and unglycosylated mutant proteins. Our results indicate that glycosylation increases the stability and cell surface expression of Shaker protein but has little effect on acquisition of the native structure.

Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). N-linked glycosylation promotes proper folding and assembly and increases the stability of a variety of glycoproteins, thereby enhancing their trafficking through the cellular endomembrane system. Glycosylation begins with the cotranslational addition of a preformed 14-residue core glycan to lumenally exposed asparagine residues that are part of the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr). Processing of the core glycan commences immediately with trimming of two of the three terminal glucose residues by ER glucosidases I and II. Generation of the monoglucosylated core glycan results in association of the newly made glycoprotein with calnexin and/or calreticulin, lectins that are part of an ER chaperone system (2Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 3Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35657-35660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Other components of this system include ER glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which catalyze a cycle of deglucosylation and reglucosylation while the protein acquires its native structure (2Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 69-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Properly folded molecules are released from the cycle, whereas misfolded molecules are retained in the ER and may be targeted for degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes. Further processing of the core glycan, specifically trimming of a particular mannose residue by ER mannosidase I, has been implicated in the proteasomal targeting of several glycoproteins (4Liu Y.

We are studying the biogenesis and quality control of voltage-dependent ion channels, using the Shaker K+ channel as the prototype (for review, see Ref. 13Papazian D.M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and references therein). Voltage-dependent ion channels are multisubunit membrane proteins that control the excitability of nerve and muscle (14Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Many channel proteins are glycosylated, a modification that may influence channel function and intracellular trafficking. For instance, sialylation of voltage-dependent Na+channels shifts the voltage dependence of activation through a surface charge effect (15Bennett E. Urcan M.S. Tinkle S.S. Koszowski A.G. Levinson S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), whereas glycosylation of the HERG (human ether-à-go-go-relatedgene) K+ channel is required for cell surface expression (16Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 17Petrecca K. Atanasiu R. Akhavan A. Shrier A. J. Physiol. 1999; 515: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The significance of ion channel glycosylation is illustrated by the finding that mutations that prevent glycosylation of the HERG protein cause long QT syndrome, type 2 (18Satler C.A. Vesely M.R. Duggal P. Ginsburg G.S. Beggs A.H. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In long QT syndrome, genetic or acquired malfunctions of ion channels delay repolarization of the cardiac action potential, predisposing affected individuals to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death (19Nerbonne J.M. J. Physiol. 2000; 525: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 20Splawski I. Shen J. Timothy K.W. Lehmann M.H. Priori S. Robinson J.L. Moss A.J. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.A. Vincent G.M. Keating M.T. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The Shaker K+ channel is particularly well suited for studies of ion channel biogenesis and quality control. Shaker channels express well in a variety of systems, including Xenopusoocytes and mammalian cell lines (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein folds and assembles into tetramers in the ER and is then efficiently transported to the Golgi apparatus where the carbohydrate chains mature prior to expression at the cell surface (22Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutant proteins that fail to acquire the native structure are recognized and retained by the quality control system of the ER (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the Shaker K+ channel protein is glycosylated on two asparagine residues, Asn259 and Asn263, in the first extracellular loop (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutating these asparagine residues to glutamine abolishes glycosylation but does not prevent the cell surface expression of functional channels inXenopus oocytes. Furthermore, the voltage dependence of unglycosylated channels is similar to that of wild-type Shaker channels (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results indicate that glycosylation is not required for the assembly of functional channels or their transport to the cell surface in Xenopus oocytes (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Residues Asn259 and Asn263 are also glycosylated in mammalian cells (22Schulteis C.T. John S.A. Huang Y. Tang C.-Y. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1725-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), where we have demonstrated that the Shaker protein interacts with calnexin shortly after synthesis (25Nagaya N. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction is transient and requires carbohydrate modification of the Shaker protein. Interestingly, ER-retained mutant proteins with defects in subunit folding and assembly also interact transiently with calnexin, with a time course similar to that of wild-type Shaker (25Nagaya N. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the mutant proteins are not retained in the ER by stable association with calnexin. Our previous studies did not directly address whether glycosylation increases the stability, cell surface expression, or folding efficiency of the Shaker protein. We have now investigated these issues in mammalian cells in culture. We find that glycosylation dramatically increases the stability and cell surface expression of the Shaker protein but is not required for acquisition of the native structure. Brefeldin A (BFA) and nocodazole (NOC) were purchased from Sigma. Clasto-lactacystin-β-lactone (Lac), which is a precursor of the cytoplasmic proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). A membrane-permeant tripeptide inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation,N-α-acetylated-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2, was kindly provided by Dr. S. M. Simon (Rockefeller University, New York). Antibodies directed against a Shaker-β-galactosidase fusion protein were the generous gift of Dr. L. Y. Jan (UCSF) (26Schwarz T.L. Papazian D.M. Carretto R.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 119-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Other primary antibodies and their sources were as follows: calnexin (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO); protein disulfide isomerase (Transduction Labs, Lexington, NY); BiP (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.); glucose-regulated protein-94 (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.); and Golgi marker protein β-COP1 (Sigma). Alexa-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) were grown as described (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and transfected with Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad). For transfection experiments, the Shaker B cDNA (27Schwarz T.L. Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 331: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and a mutant construct, N259Q,N263Q, which eliminatesN-linked glycosylation of the Shaker protein (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), were transferred into the vector pcDNA1/AMP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A S346C mutation was engineered into wild-type and unglycosylated mutant Shaker cDNAs using polymerase chain reaction methods as described previously (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A total of 1 μg of DNA was used per 35-mm well of cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, HEK293T cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), pulsed for 1 h with 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-Label, ICN, Irvine, CA), and chased for various times in complete, nonradioactive medium. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors as described previously (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Immunoprecipitation of Shaker protein was performed as described previously (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using an antibody directed against a Shaker-β-galactosidase fusion protein (26Schwarz T.L. Papazian D.M. Carretto R.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 119-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Protein samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing either 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (reducing conditions) or 16 mmiodoacetamide (nonreducing conditions) and boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on denaturing 5 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gels with 3 or 4% stacking gels (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To normalize the amount of protein in electrophoresis samples, 5% of the lysate supernatant was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and counted in a scintillation counter. Lanes were loaded with samples containing equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts per minute. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, soaked in fluorographic enhancer, dried, and exposed to film. Specific disulfide bonds between Shaker subunits were oxidized in intact cells by exposing them to 20, 50, or 100 mmH2O2 for 15 min as described previously (28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reaction was quenched by adding 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 5 min (28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Shaker protein was then solubilized, immunoprecipitated, and boiled in sample buffer containing either 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (reducing conditions) or 16 mm iodoacetamide (nonreducing conditions). For electrophysiological analysis,Xenopus oocytes were injected with 4–10 ng of cRNA and incubated for 24 h at 17 °C. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature (22–23 °C) in modified Barth's saline using a two-electrode voltage clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) (29Timpe L.C. Schwarz T.L. Tempel B.L. Papazian D.M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1988; 331: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The data were acquired using pCLAMP version 5.5.1 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using Origin version 5.0 (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Statistical analysis was performed using InStat version 2.0.1 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (30Khanna R. Roy L. Zhu X. Schlichter L.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C796-C806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells growing on glass coverslips were transiently transfected with various cDNAs and, 48 h after transfection, washed twice with PBS and then fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehdye for 20 min. The fixative was removed by washing (three times for 5 min each time) in PBS, and then the cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min, followed by washing in PBS (twice for 5 min each time). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubating the coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 10% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After washing in PBS (three times for 10 min each time), the cells were incubated (for 2 h at room temperature) with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against a Shaker β-galactosidase fusion protein (1:200 dilution in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against calnexin, an ER-resident protein (1:250 dilution). After washing the antibody-labeled HEK293T cells in PBS (three times for 5 min each time), the cells were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000) and Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:1500)) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed in PBS (three times for 5 min each time) and then rinsed briefly in distilled water and mounted in SlowFade (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained with a 63× quartz objective on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Dm IRB/E, Meyer Instruments Inc., Houston, TX). Cell surface expression of wild-type and mutant Shaker proteins was analyzed by biotinylation of an engineered extracellular cysteine using an impermeant reagent (31Basiry S.S. Mendoza P. Lee P.D. Raymond L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 644-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, at 24–36 h post-transfection, HEK293T cells were washed twice with PBS (warmed to 37 °C) and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min with HPDP-biotin (0.03 mg/ml; Pierce) in PBS solution. The cells were then washed two to three times with warm PBS to remove the biotinylating reagent. The cells were collected in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, rotated for 15 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Aliquots corresponding to 5% of the total volume of the solubilized material were reserved. The rest of the solubilized material was incubated with ∼25 μl of streptavidin-linked agarose beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and washed three to five times with 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Bead-precipitated protein was eluted by boiling in 50 μl of gel loading buffer followed by brief centrifugation. The streptavidin-precipitated protein, together with the aliquots of the total solubilized material, were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% acrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotted using a rabbit polyclonal anti-Shaker antibody, and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Protein bands were quantified by densitometry (model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer; Bio-Rad) using Molecular Analyst software (version 1.4; Bio-Rad). To determine whether N-linked glycosylation stabilizes K+ channel protein in mammalian cells, the wild-type Shaker protein and an unglycosylated mutant, N259Q,N263Q, were expressed in HEK293T cells for pulse-chase analysis. The cells were metabolically labeled during a 1-h pulse and were either harvested immediately or incubated in nonradioactive medium for chase periods up to 48 h. After detergent extraction, Shaker protein was immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoresis and fluorography. As previously reported, the wild-type Shaker protein was detected after the pulse as a core-glycosylated precursor, which matured to a complex glycosylated form after processing in the Golgi apparatus (Fig.1 A) (21Santacruz-Toloza L.

The unglycosylated N259Q,N263Q protein migrated slightly faster than the core-glycosylated immature form of the wild-type protein (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol.

The wild-type and unglycosylated mutant proteins were differentially stable during the chase period. The wild-type protein was stable up to 48 h, whereas the unglycosylated mutant protein was degraded at a significantly faster rate (Fig. 1). At 24 h, ∼98% of the wild-type protein but only 24% of the unglycosylated mutant protein remained (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether cytoplasmic proteasomes play a role in the degradation of the unglycosylated Shaker mutant, transfected HEK293T cells were incubated in lactacystin, a proteasome-specific inhibitor (32Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Treatment with lactacystin significantly slowed degradation of unglycosylated Shaker protein; at 24 h, 65% of the unglycosylated mutant protein remained (Fig. 1). In contrast, the wild-type protein was unaffected by lactacystin. These results indicate that in the absence of glycosylation, the Shaker protein is targeted for degradation by proteasomes. However, alternative degradation pathways may also be involved because lactacystin did not completely prevent degradation of the unglycosylated mutant protein. To investigate whether lysosomes are involved in Shaker protein turnover, the pulse-chase experiment was repeated in the presence of the lysosomotropic agent NH4Cl. At 36 h of chase, NH4Cl had no effect on the turnover of either wild-type or unglycosylated mutant proteins (Fig. 2). Similarly, the serine/cysteine protease inhibitors leupeptin and pepstatin A, which are known to inhibit lysosomal proteases (33Breuer P. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33254-33258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), had no effect on the degradation rate of the wild-type or mutant proteins (Fig. 2). These results indicate that lysosomes do not contribute significantly to the degradation of Shaker proteins during a 36-h chase period. Proteins in the secretory pathway that are targeted to the proteasome for degradation are thought to undergo retrograde translocation directly from the ER to the cytoplasm (34Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 35Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). In a few cases, however, the substrate protein must be transferred to a post-ER compartment prior to degradation (36Raposo G. Van Santen H.M. Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we characterized the turnover of the unglycosylated mutant protein after trapping it in the ER with BFA in the presence of NOC. Under these conditions, the protein was still degraded rapidly by the lactacystin-sensitive proteasomal pathway (Fig. 3). These results indicate that proteasomal targeting of the unglycosylated mutant protein occurs directly from the ER. The data presented so far do not rule out the possibility that the N259Q,N263Q protein is rapidly degraded because of the asparagine-to-glutamine mutations per se rather than the lack of glycosylation. To investigate this issue, we blockedN-linked glycosylation of the wild-type protein with a tripeptide inhibitor, Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2 (38Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 289-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Wild-type Shaker protein that has not been glycosylated was degraded by the lactacystin-sensitive proteasome pathway with kinetics similar to that of the N259Q,N263Q double mutant (Fig.4). These results confirm that lack of glycosylation targets the Shaker protein for degradation by cytoplasmic proteasomes. Glycosylation is not absolutely required for cell surface expression of functional Shaker channels in Xenopus oocytes (21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, our previous study did not address whether glycosylation increases the rate and/or amount of channel protein inserted into the plasma membrane. To test the hypothesis that glycosylation promotes cell surface expression of Shaker channels, we performed confocal microscopy and surface biotinylation experiments. HEK293T cells expressing wild-type or the unglycosylated mutant proteins were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then double-labeled with antibodies directed against Shaker and calnexin, an ER-resident protein. Wild-type Shaker protein showed robust cell surface expression with little or no overlap with calnexin (Fig.5, top row). Similarly, there was no overlap between labeling for the wild-type protein and other ER markers such as BiP, GRP94 (glucose-regulatedprotein 94), and protein disulfide isomerase or the Golgi marker, β-COP1 (data not shown). These results indicate that the wild-type protein exits the ER and trafficks to the cell surface efficiently (Fig. 5, middle row). Cell surface expression was also observed for the unglycosylated mutant protein. In contrast to the wild-type protein, however, a significant fraction of the unglycosylated protein was retained intracellularly, overlapping in distribution with the ER marker calnexin (Fig. 5, arrow). In addition, some of the unglycosylated Shaker protein was found in punctate clusters that resembled aggresomes (39Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). To compare quantitatively the levels of glycosylated and unglycosylated Shaker protein at the cell surface, we performed cell surface biotinylation at an engineered cysteine at position 346 in the extracellular S3–S4 loop. First, we confirmed that the S346C mutation does not affect the stability, functional expression, or localization of the Shaker protein (Fig. 6). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the S346C and N259Q,N263Q,S346C proteins turn over with kinetics similar to those of the wild-type and N259Q,N263Q proteins, respectively (Fig. 6 A). Confocal analysis indicated that the S346C mutation does not alter the distribution of the wild-type and unglycosylated Shaker proteins (Fig.6 B; compare with Fig. 5). Furthermore, upon expression inXenopus oocytes, S346C and N259Q,N263Q,S346C proteins generated functional channels (Fig. 6 C). HEK293T cells expressing the S346C or N259Q, N263Q,S346C proteins were incubated with the cysteine-specific, impermeant reagent HPDP-biotin (31Basiry S.S. Mendoza P. Lee P.D. Raymond L.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 644-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After detergent solubilization, biotinylated protein was precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads and subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with the Shaker-specific antibody. An unfractionated aliquot (5%) of the solubilized material was analyzed in parallel to determine the fraction of Shaker protein biotinylated by the procedure (Fig. 7). The results indicate that expression at the cell surface was significantly higher (∼7-fold, p < 0.001, paired Student's t test) for the glycosylated S346C protein than for the unglycosylated N259Q,N263Q,S346C protein (Fig. 7). Biotinylation occurred specifically at S346C, because no Shaker immunoreactive material was precipitated with streptavidin beads after biotinylation of intact cells expressing the wild-type or N259Q,N263Q mutant proteins (data not shown). The wild-type Shaker protein was biotinylated on endogenous intracellular cysteines if cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to application of HPDP-biotin, however (data not shown). We conclude that glycosylation significantly increases surface expression of the Shaker protein in HEK293T cells, consistent with the results of confocal microscopy. In the Shaker channel, intracellular cysteine residues in the amino (Cys96) and carboxyl (Cys505) termini of adjacent subunits form disulfide bonds in intact cells exposed to mild oxidizing conditions (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds are generated between adjacent Shaker monomers, resulting in the sequential formation of dimers, trimers, linear tetramers, and circular tetramers (28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Previous results indicate that disulfide-bonded adducts are generated in Shaker proteins that are able to fold and assemble properly but not in mutant proteins that are recognized as abnormal and retained by the ER quality control system (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, the capacity to form intersubunit disulfide bonds provides a useful hallmark of the native structure of the Shaker channel and can be used as an indirect measure of folding and subunit assembly (13Papazian D.M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Intact HEK293T cells expressing the wild-type or unglycosylated mutant proteins were metabolically labeled and exposed to the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide (20–100 mm) to favor disulfide bond formation. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide to protect remaining free sulfhydryl groups prior to solubilization and immunoprecipitation. Under nonreducing conditions, most of the monomer band was converted to higher molecular mass adducts corresponding to a dimer, trimer, linear tetramer, and a circular tetramer (Ref. 28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and data not shown). As expected, adducts formed by the unglycosylated Shaker mutant were smaller than those of the glycosylated wild-type protein (Ref. 24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar and data not shown). Fig. 8 summarizes the percentage of the total Shaker protein converted to higher molecular mass adducts in cells expressing the wild-type (open bars) or unglycosylated (filled bars) proteins exposed to 20, 50, or 100 mm H2O2 for 10 min. Overall, more than 60% of the Shaker protein was converted to higher molecular mass adducts under these conditions, with larger adducts predominating at higher concentrations of H2O2 (Ref. 28Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12133-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and data not shown). Importantly, similar levels of disulfide-bonded adducts were observed for the wild-type and unglycosylated mutant proteins (Fig. 8; p > 0.05, Student's ttest). By this measure of channel folding and assembly, glycosylation of the Shaker protein does not significantly promote acquisition of the native state. We have investigated the role of N-linked glycosylation in the stability, folding, cell surface expression, and proteasomal targeting of the Shaker K+ channel protein. The data indicate that glycosylation dramatically increases stability and cell surface expression, without significantly affecting folding and assembly of the protein. In the absence of N-linked glycosylation, a significant fraction of the protein is retained in the ER and degraded. Cytoplasmic proteasomes contribute to the degradation of the unglycosylated protein, although other nonlysosomal proteolytic pathways may also be involved. Our results imply that proteasomal targeting of the unglycosylated protein is not the result of gross misfolding or improper assembly, although we cannot rule out subtle changes in the structure of the protein resulting from the lack of carbohydrate modification. How does N-linked glycosylation stabilize the Shaker protein? One possibility is that interaction with calnexin and/or calreticulin protects newly made wild-type Shaker protein from retrotranslocation and proteasomal degradation. We have previously shown that calnexin interacts transiently with the wild-type Shaker protein shortly after its synthesis in the ER (25Nagaya N. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the unglycosylated N259Q,N263Q mutant protein fails to associate with calnexin, consistent with the expectation that calnexin binds specifically to proteins containing monoglucosylated glycans (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar,3Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35657-35660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis is that the wild-type and unglycosylated Shaker proteins are differentially sensitive to ER-associated degradation because they are transported out of the ER at different rates. Even though glycosylation has little apparent effect on the eventual acquisition of the native structure, it may increase the rate of folding and assembly of the Shaker protein, thereby allowing a more rapid exit from the ER. Although the oxidation assay provides a way to assess the net outcome of biogenesis, it does not monitor the kinetics of the process. Timely exit from the ER may be a key factor in protecting the wild-type but not the unglycosylated protein from degradation. Although we did not ascertain the kinetics of ER exit of the wild-type and unglycosylated Shaker proteins, our finding that a significant fraction of the unglycosylated Shaker protein is located in the ER (Fig. 5) supports the hypothesis that residence time in the ER is a determinant of degradation. Interestingly, mannose trimming by ER mannosidase I, which is implicated in the proteasomal targeting of some glycoproteins, has been proposed as a timing mechanism that regulates degradation (12Fagioli C. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12885-12892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We propose that the kinetics of ER exit could serve as an alternative timing mechanism to regulate turnover. In this scenario, calnexin and/or calreticulin could, by accelerating folding and assembly, still play a role in protecting the wild-type protein from proteolysis. We have identified a variety of mutations that disrupt folding or assembly of the Shaker protein, preventing exit from the ER (24Schulteis C.T. Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26210-26217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins are core glycosylated and, similarly to wild type, interact transiently with calnexin (25Nagaya N. Schulteis C.T. Papazian D.M. Receptors Channels. 1999; 6: 229-239PubMed Google Scholar). Studying the turnover of these mutant proteins should shed light on the relative roles of calnexin and ER retention in regulating degradation of the Shaker protein. In HEK293T cells, glycosylation stabilizes the Shaker protein and dramatically enhances its trafficking to the cell surface. A significant fraction of the unglycosylated protein is retained intracellularly. Yet functional channels are readily detected when the N259Q,N263Q mutant is expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Ref. 21Santacruz-Toloza L. Huang Y. John S.A. Papazian D.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5607-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholarand this study). Although we have not quantitatively compared protein amounts or current amplitudes produced by the wild-type and unglycosylated mutant cRNAs in Xenopus oocytes, the levels of expression appear to be similar. This is consistent with the results of oxidation experiments, which indicate that the unglycosylated protein folds and assembles as efficiently as wild type in HEK293T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the unglycosylated Shaker protein trafficks to the plasma membrane much more efficiently in Xenopus oocytes than in HEK293T cells. One factor that may be relevant is that oocytes and HEK293T cells are maintained at different temperatures, 17 and 37 °C, respectively. This will affect the kinetics of folding and assembly, intracellular trafficking, and degradation, with the observed outcome of similar expression levels for the wild-type and N259Q,N263Q proteins. Given these results, it would be interesting to know whether the unglycosylated HERG K+channel mutant, which is trapped intracellularly in mammalian cells, is able to reach the plasma membrane in Xenopus oocytes. Differential trafficking of other proteins, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, in oocytes and in mammalian cells has been previously observed (40Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Xiong X. Bragin A. Widdicombe J.H. Cohn J. Skach W.R. J. Clin.

In the past few years, high resolution structures have been reported for the KcsA bacterial potassium channel as well as several soluble domains from K+ channels (42Doyle D.A. Morais-Cabral J.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of a voltage-dependent K+ channel is now eagerly awaited but will require biochemical overexpression and purification of homogeneous protein preparations. Our results have implications for biochemical overexpression of eukaryotic K+ channel proteins for structural analysis, where unglycosylated protein might be useful for reducing heterogeneity of the protein preparation. Although our results suggest that genetic removal of glycosylation may not impair acquisition of the native state, lack of glycosylation may reduce levels of protein because of degradation in some cell types.

By using real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that injury-induced genes could be categorized into four temporal expression patterns. Among the clones we identified were a number that were homologous only to expressed sequence tags in the data base. These were stratified based on their expression profile, presence of identifiable sequence motifs, homologies to other proteins, and evolutionary conservation. We chose one representative gene, nin283, to analyze in detail. The nin283 gene encodes a 227-residue protein containing both a zinc finger and a RING finger motif.nin283 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, particularly in the developing cortical plate in embryos. It is also expressed in peripheral ganglia and is induced by nerve growth factor in PC12 cells.

Jollès P. Lysozymes: Model Enzymes in Biochemistry and Biology. Birkhäuser, Basel1996: 35-64Google Scholar, 5Höltje J.V. Jollès P. Lysozymes: Model Enzymes in Biochemistry and Biology. Birkhäuser, Basel1996: 65-74Google Scholar for reviews). Of the Ch-type phage lysozymes, the best characterized are those from phages ofStreptococcus pneumoniae (Cp phages) andLactobacillus spp. (phages MV1 and Φadh) (4Fastrez J. Jollès P. Lysozymes: Model Enzymes in Biochemistry and Biology. Birkhäuser, Basel1996: 35-64Google Scholar). In addition to a muramidase domain with clear sequence similarity toChalaropsis lysozyme, some of these phage enzymes appear to carry additional domains for efficient binding of the polymeric substrates. Very little structural information for Ch-type lysozymes is available. Circular dichroism studies yielded spectra that were completely different from those of HEWL (6Chang J.J. Holaday L.A. Hash J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7772-7777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals have been reported for a number of Ch-type lysozymes (7Morita T. Hara S. Matsushima Y. J.

Sugawara H. Naitow H. Kay Y. Satow Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 1462-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but the only structural report available so far describes a low resolution model for the muramidase from Streptomyces erythraeus (also called ‘S. labaedae‘), which was determined in the absence of a complete amino acid sequence for the enzyme (12Harada S. Raghupathy S. Kakudo M. Hara S. Ikenaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11600-11602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This structural model comprises a polypeptide chain of ∼180 amino acid residues folded into three domains; in the present article we show that it is probably incorrect (see below). We present here the first complete and refined three-dimensional structure of a lysozyme from the Chalaropsis family, which is at the same time the first such structure for a bacterial lysozyme. Cellosyl is a very basic (pI > 10) 23 kDa-muramidase excreted byStreptomyces coelicolor Müller, a Gram-positive bacterium found in soil. Like the Chalaropsis lysozyme, it possesses both β-1,4-N-acetylmuramidase and β-1,4-N,6-O-diacetylmuramidase, i.e.staphylolytic, activity (13Bräu B. et al.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 34: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because Staphylococcus aureusis an important food pathogen, this enzymatic activity makes Cellosyl very interesting for prevention of food spoilage and food-borne disease (13Bräu B. et al.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 34: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzyme was therefore tested in food preservation, with very promising results in cheese manufacturing (prevention of late blowing caused by anaerobic spore formers such as Clostridium tyrobutyricum). Cellosyl could also be used to solve problems caused by Clostridium botulinum in vacuum-packaged fish, and its application has been shown to significantly reduce the total number of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in meat products. Based on these results, Cellosyl appears to be an attractive replacement for nitrate (a potential source for the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines) in food preservation (13Bräu B. et al.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 34: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Hughey V.L. Johnson E.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and purification of Cellosyl have been described in the literature (13Bräu B. et al.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1991; 34: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Crystals of Cellosyl were grown at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Protein droplets were prepared by mixing 2 µl of protein solution and 2 µl of precipitant solution. The former contained 10 mg/ml Cellosyl in 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, and 100 mm NaCl. The precipitant was 1.6 m(NH4)2SO4 in 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.0. Monoclinic crystals appeared within 2 weeks and reached a size sufficient for diffraction data collection within two months, with maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.04 mm. These crystals are different from those previously reported (10Hilgenfeld R. Liesum A. Storm R. J. Crys. Growth. 1992; 112: 330-336Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Osmium and mercury derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals at room temperature in a solution containing 1.6 m(NH4)2SO4, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.0, and 10 mm of the respective metal chloride (HgCl2 or OsCl3) for 72 h. An osmium-mercury cross derivative was obtained using a solution of 1.6m (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.0, 7.5 mm HgCl2, and 7.5 mm OsCl3. Diffraction data analysis allowed us to assign Cellosyl crystals to the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 111.15 Å, b = 38.22 Å,c = 51.04 Å, β = 108.21°. The crystals contained one protein monomer per asymmetric unit (23 kDa), corresponding to a Matthews coefficient (15Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) of 2.18 Å3/dalton and a solvent content of 43%. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K using highly liquid paraffin oil as cryoprotectant (16Riblodi-Tunnicliffe A. Hilgenfeld R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 1003-1005Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mercury derivative diffraction data were collected at beamline X11 (λ = 0.97 Å) of the EMBL Outstation at DESY, Hamburg, using a MAR CCD detector (x-ray Research, Hamburg, Germany). All other derivatives were collected in-house using a MAR 300-mm imaging plate detector (x-ray Research) and CuKαradiation. All diffraction data were autoindexed, processed, scaled, and merged using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL package (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method using three heavy-atom derivatives (osmium, mercury, osmium-mercury cross derivative). Heavy atom positions were located by difference Patterson and difference Fourier maps using the CNS package (18Bruenger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Their positions, occupancies, and isotropic B factors were refined with the program SHARP (19de LaFortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The initial MIR phases extended to 2.0 Å, and the initial density map was improved by density modification using SHARP (estimated solvent content 43%). The electron density map displayed clear molecular boundaries and was interpretable. Density-modified phases from SHARP were used as input to ARP/wARP (20Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 5: 458-463Crossref Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). This program was able to automatically trace the entire main chain with the exception of the C-terminal residue, which exhibits poor electron density. Furthermore, ARP/wARP automatically placed all but five side chains into the density. Manual building of the remaining poorly fit side chains was conducted in O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 101-119Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), although the majority of necessary adjustments involved side-chain flipping of the terminal χ angle for several Asn, Gln, and His residues to satisfy hydrogen bonding requirements. Refinement of the rebuilt model was conducted in CNS (18Bruenger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) using 4.9% of the reflections as a test set. Both overall B-factor corrections and bulk solvent corrections were applied. Subsequent simulated annealing, conjugate gradient, and atomic B-factor refinement resulted in anR-factor of 27.3% (R free = 30.8%). The addition of 9 chloride ions based on strong anomalous peaks (>5 ς above the mean) present in the primary solvent shell and of 399 water molecules, along with further refinement, lowered theR-factor to a final value of 15.2% andR free of 18.4% for all reflections between 50–1.65 Å. There is clear electron density in the final map for all 217 amino acid residues with the exception of the apparently highly mobile side chain of Arg-208 and the C-terminal residue Ala-217. Bond lengths and angles are close to ideal for almost all residues (TableI). Most of the residues (87%) in the polypeptide chain lie within the highly favorable regions of the Ramanchandran plot and none fall into the disallowed region (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The structure of Cellosyl comprises a single domain, with the shape of a flattened ellipsoid with dimensions of 45 Å × 35 Å × 25 Å. The enzyme has a β/α-barrel fold, which is different from the (β/α)8-barrels found in triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) and many other enzymes (23Reardon D. Faber G.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is composed of eight β-strands and six α-helices, with the strands forming the staves of the barrel and the helices located around it (Fig. 2). As in regular TIM barrels, the first five β-strands and α-helices alternate. However, the fifth α-helix is followed by strands β6 to β8, which are connected by loops lacking any helices. Helix α6 is located at the C terminus of the polypeptide chain, sitting at the bottom (N-terminal end) of the barrel. All β-strands are arranged parallel to one another, except strand β8 which, very unusually, is in an antiparallel orientation with respect to the other strands. The loop between the antiparallel strands β7 and β8 consists of eight amino acid residues. This is considerably shorter than the connections between the parallel β-strands which are between 17 and 37 residues long (including the α-helices). Strand β2 (residues 29 to 36) is somewhat longer than most other strands in the barrel and forms a short β-hairpin (hydrogen bonding with residues 40 and 42) at its C-terminal end. The loop connecting β1 and α1 contains a short 310 helix. The only disulfide bond of Cellosyl involves Cys-108 in the loop between β4 and α4 and Cys-147 at the C-terminal end of α5. In all known conventional β/α-barrel enzymes, the active site is located at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel. Despite the presence of one antiparallel strand (β8) in the barrel, the same can be expected for Cellosyl. This is supported by the fact that amino acids at the C-terminal ends of β1 to β4 are highly conserved among lysozymes from bacteria andChalaropsis (Fig. 3). Indeed, a prominent, long groove, very likely the substrate-binding site, is located on the C-terminal face of the Cellosyl β-barrel. This groove culminates in a deep hole of highly negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 4), which we identified as the catalytic site of the enzyme.Figure 4Charge distribution on the surface of Cellosyl. Positively and negatively charged electrostatic potentials are indicated in blue and red, respectively. The surface was calculated using a probe radius of 1.4 Å, and the potential was displayed on a scale ranging from −17.2 kBT to +19.8 kBT (kB = Boltzmann constant). Important residues are labeled. The figure was generated with the program Grasp (38Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). The deep hole at the catalytic site is seen at the center of the molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The central hole is lined by acidic residues Asp-9, Asp-98, Glu-100, and Asp-198. Glu-36, which has previously been proposed to be involved in catalysis in Ch-type lysozymes (24Fouche P.B. Hash J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6787-6793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is located at the tip of strand β2. Its carboxylate side chain is oriented toward the substrate-binding groove but it is not part of the central hole. Also, it lacks an acidic or neutral hydrogen-bonding residue in its immediate spatial neighborhood; rather, it forms a strong salt bridge (2.70 Å) with the conserved Lys-33. We therefore suggest that Glu-36 is involved in substrate binding, but not in substrate cleavage. This is supported by the finding that mutation of Glu-36 in Ch-type phage lysozymes does not lead to a dramatic reduction of the activity (25Sanz J.M. Garcia P. Garcia J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8495-8499Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The other residue previously proposed to be involved in the catalytic activity of Ch-type lysozymes is Asp-9 (24Fouche P.B. Hash J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6787-6793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation studies on the pneumococcal Chalaropsis lysozyme yielded 2.2, 1.7, and 0.2% of the wild-type activity for mutants D9N, D9E, and D9A, respectively (25Sanz J.M. Garcia P. Garcia J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8495-8499Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Cellosyl, Asp-9 is hydrogen bonded to Asp-198 which, however, is not conserved within the Chalaropsislysozyme family. Across from Asp-9, on the opposite rim of the central hole (see Fig.4), the carboxylic groups of the absolutely conserved residues Asp-98 and Glu-100 are lined up. The pair Asp-98/Glu-100 is connected by a strong hydrogen bond (Asp-98 Oδ1 -Glu-100 Oε1: 2.6 Å), requiring at least one of the two carboxylic groups to be protonated. Judging from the active site geometry, Asp-9, Asp-98, and Glu-100 are candidates for the catalytically active residues. The central hole is ∼8–9 Å deep. Its walls are mainly formed by the aromatic side chains of Tyr-31, Tyr-62, Phe-64, Tyr-138, and Trp-161, whereas Val-96 is at the very bottom of the hole. Hydrophobic residues are located at those positions throughout the Chalaropsislysozyme family. Two of the tyrosines, Tyr-62 and Tyr-138, are absolutely conserved and have their phenolic side chains oriented parallel to one another at a distance of 7.0 Å (Fig.5). Interestingly, a water molecule (H2O44) is sandwiched between their phenyl rings, almost halfway down the deep hole. The distance between the water oxygen and the center of the aromatic ring of Tyr-138 is 3.3 Å, suggesting a possible O-H···π interaction. The corresponding distance to the parallel phenyl ring, Tyr-62, is too large (3.7 Å) for a hydrogen bond-like interaction. Instead, H2O44 forms H-bonds with the carboxylic group of the presumable active site residue Asp-98 (2.8 Å) and with water H2O85 (2.8 Å). As outlined in the introduction, four different classes of lysozymes can be distinguished at present (1Jollès P. Jollès J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 63: 165-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). It is believed that the three classes represented by HEWL, GEWL, and phage T4L are the result of divergent evolution from a common ancestor (26Weaver L.H. Grütter M.G. Remington S.J. Gray T.M. Isaacs N.W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1985; 21: 97-111Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that they do not share any statistically significant sequence identity, their three-dimensional structures show some intriguing, albeit distant, similarities. The active site is located in a crevice between two domains, which are connected by a long α-helix. A glutamic acid residue, proposed to be essential for general acid catalysis, is located at the C-terminal end of an α-helix in the N-terminal half of each of the proteins (26Weaver L.H. Grütter M.G. Remington S.J. Gray T.M. Isaacs N.W. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1985; 21: 97-111Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The β/α-barrel fold of Cellosyl is completely unrelated to the tertiary structures of HEWL, GEWL, and T4L and defines a fourth family, that of the Chalaropsis-type lysozymes. Harada et al. (12Harada S. Raghupathy S. Kakudo M. Hara S. Ikenaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11600-11602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) published a Cα backbone model for a lysozyme fromS. erythraeus that has about the same molecular weight as Cellosyl but was described as consisting of three distinct domains, very different from the structure presented here. Given the significant sequence similarity (49% identity) between the twoStreptomyces lysozymes, it is conceivable that the apparent structural differences are caused by the relatively low resolution (2.9 Å) of that crystallographic study, which was carried out in 1981,i.e. before the advent of molecular graphics and in the absence of a complete amino acid sequence (12Harada S. Raghupathy S. Kakudo M. Hara S. Ikenaka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11600-11602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of Cellosyl also displays 47% identity to that ofChalaropsis lysozyme, the prototype of the Ch lysozyme family. It is therefore conceivable that all members of this family share the unusual β/α-fold described here. Because the first five strands and helices of Cellosyl are similar to the corresponding secondary structure elements of conventional, all-parallel, (β/α)8-barrels, a search for structural similarities (27Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) yields those as (albeit rather distant) relatives. The highest similarity is displayed by bacterial and fungal cellulases, which hydrolyze the glycosidic bond of polysaccharide substrates. Among these enzymes, the closest relative of Cellosyl is an exo-β-(1, 3)-glucanase from Candida albicans (PDB code: 1CZ1) (28Cutfield S.M. Davies J.D. Murshudov G. Anderson B.F. Moody P.C.E. Sullivan P.A. Cutfield J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with an r.m.s. deviation of Cα atom positions as high as 3.3 Å for 167 equivalent positions. This is followed by the endoglucanase CelC from Clostridium thermocellum (r.m.s.d. 3.6 Å for 165 residues, PDB code: 1CEO) (29Dominguez R. Souchon H. Lascombe M.B. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a family 5 endoglucanase. Both enzymes possess an irregular (β/α)8-barrel topology in which helix α5 is absent or only one turn long. (The barrel of CelC has an additional helical subdomain of 55 residues located between β6 and α6, Ref. 29Dominguez R. Souchon H. Lascombe M.B. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 1042-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In Cellosyl, helix α5 comprises eight residues but the helices corresponding to α6 and α7 in the conventional TIM barrel are missing. The active site glutamate residues of the aforementioned glucanases are located at the C termini of strands β4 and β7. In Cellosyl, the proposed catalytic residues (Asp-9, Asp-98, and Glu-100) are located at the C-terminal ends of strands β1 and β4, whereas strand β7 does not carry residues likely to be directly involved in catalysis. As mentioned above, a very unique structural feature of Cellosyl is the antiparallel orientation of strand β8 in the barrel (Fig.6). The only other enzyme known to have a β/α-barrel fold with an antiparallel β-strand is enolase (30Lebioda L. Stec B. Brewer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3685-3693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enolase is a glycolytic enzyme which catalyzes the dehydration of 2-phospho-d-glycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. The protein consists of a smaller N-terminal domain and a larger C-terminal domain, which is an 8-fold β/α-barrel with a ββαα(βα)6 topology. In the enolase barrel, the second β-strand is antiparallel to the other strands, and the first α-helix is antiparallel to the other α-helices. The unusual antiparallel orientation of a β-strand in a β/α-barrel does not seem to lead to a reduced number of hydrogen bonds made by main-chain amides and carbonyls in the strand. The antiparallel strand β2 in enolase makes 10 main-chain hydrogen bonds with its neighbors, and in Cellosyl, there are seven H-bonds made between strands β8 and β7, and three such interactions between strands β8 and β1. The number of hydrogen bonds made by strand β8 of Cellosyl therefore agrees well with the average number (6Chang J.J. Holaday L.A. Hash J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7772-7777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Morita T. Hara S. Matsushima Y. J. Biochem. 1978; 83: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 8Harada S.

The fact that the second β-strand of the barrel of enolase is arranged in an antiparallel fashion is, unfortunately, hardly mentioned at all in the literature. Thus, enolase has been grouped into one superfamily with muconate-lactonizing enzyme and mandelate racemase, which exhibit the canonical all-parallel β8 topology (31Faber G.K. Petsko G.A.

The sodium pump is essential to the maintenance of the electrochemical gradients of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane of virtually all animal cells and consequently provides the driving force for the transport of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids into the cell. This enzyme is a P-type ATPase transporter and, as such, is directly phosphorylated on a conserved aspartate residue within its cytoplasmic domain. Both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of the enzyme exist in at least two states that undergo conformational transitions (E 1P → E 2P andE 2 → E 1) that are coupled to the ion-translocating steps. The Na,K-ATPase comprises two essential subunits: a large catalytic α subunit (∼110 kDa), containing the phosphorylation site as well as the binding sites for Na+, K+, ATP and for the cardiac glycoside ouabain, and a smaller, highly glycosylated β subunit (∼35–55 kDa) that ensures the proper folding and delivery of the α subunit to the plasma membrane, possibly also modulating cation affinity (1Sweadner K.J.

A third subunit, γ (∼7 kDa), was found in the kidney (3Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III, B. J.

In the case of α, there are four known isoforms that are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific manner. In the rat, they are distributed as follows. α1 is the ubiquitous, “housekeeping” isoform; α2 is expressed in muscle, nerves, and adult heart; α3 is present in nerves, brain, and fetal heart; and recently the protein for α4 was found in rat testis, where it may participate in spermatogenesis and sperm motility (5Woo A.L.

Both our laboratory and others have compared the functional properties of the α1, α2*, and α3* isoforms of the rat Na,K-ATPase within the same mammalian membrane environment following transfection of their cDNAs into HeLa cells. (α2* and α3* are the rat α2 and α3 isoforms rendered relatively resistant to ouabain, to permit their distinction from endogenous ouabain sensitive enzyme (8Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) The results showed that the isozymes exhibit differences in their apparent ligand affinities (see Table I). Both α2* and α3* have a 3-fold higher apparent affinity for ATP binding (low affinity site) compared with the α1 isoform (K′ATP values of 120 and 130 µm, respectively, compared with 331 µm) (9Daly S.E.

Values shown are the mean ± S.D. of the number of experiments shown in parenthesis. The present study investigates whether the aforementioned differences in apparent affinities for ligands are the consequence of primary differences in ligand interactions or whether and to what extent they reflect differences in the E 1 ⇌E 2 conformational equilibrium. The results of the present study, together with our earlier work (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), show that the kinetic differences of the α2* isoform are a consequence of a shift in the poise of the conformational equilibrium toward theE 1 form of the enzyme. In the case of α3*, the mechanistic basis for the observed differences in ligand binding is less straightforward. The notable differences in apparent cation affinities are not explained by a shift in the poise of theE 1 ⇌ E 2 balance. Nevertheless, they do reflect, at least partly, a change in the rates of limiting steps of its reaction cycle. HeLa cells expressing the rat α1, α2*, and α3* enzymes (a generous gift from Dr. J. B Lingrel) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units of penicillin G, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, and 1 µm ouabain as described previously (9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NaI-treated microsomal membranes were prepared from the transfected HeLa cells as described elsewhere (8Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17930-17934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the membrane preparations were determined using the Lowry assay as modified by Markwell et al. (13Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Tolbert N.E. Bieber L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase activity was measured as the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as previously described (14Blostein R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, the membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with all reactants added except ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Final concentrations for Na,K-ATPase activity measurements were 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmKCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 20 mm histidine (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and 5 µmouabain (Sigma). To analyze kinetic behavior under various conditions and unless indicated otherwise, Na,K-ATPase measurements were carried out using 1 mm ATP as in our earlier studies (cf. Refs. 9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Blostein R. J. Biol.

This was done in order to maximize the precision (maximal percentage of Pi release due to Na,K-ATPase) of the kinetic studies of the relatively low activity transfected cells. A final concentration of 5 mm ouabain was used to determine base-line hydrolysis activity. Na-ATPase activity was measured at 1 µm ATP as described previously (9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with varying amounts of added KCl and choline chloride to maintain constant chloride (40 mm) concentration. Where indicated,V max values shown were derived from activities measured at 1 mm ATP using values ofK′ATP given in TableI. For studies of vanadate sensitivity, inorganic orthovanadate (Fisher) solutions were prepared fresh prior to the experiment and added with the [γ-32P]ATP solution to initiate the reaction at the indicated concentrations. Values of Na,K-ATPase obtained at various vanadate concentrations, expressed as percentages of that obtained in the absence of vanadate, were analyzed by fitting the data to a one-compartment model using a nonlinear least square analysis of a general logistic function as described elsewhere (15DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Berrebi-Bertrand I. Maixent J.M. Christe G. Lelievre L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1021: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Effects of varying pH on Na-ATPase or Na,K-ATPase were determined as indicated in the above enzyme assays except using 30 mmMES1/Tris (pH values of 6.2 and 6.5) or 30 mm Tris/HCl (pH ≥7.0) instead of histidine. Phosphoenzyme levels were determined as described earlier (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were preincubated with ouabain (20 µm ouabain, 0.4 mm MgSO4, and 10 mmglycylglycine-Tris (pH 7.4)) for 10 min at 37 °C to inhibit endogenous HeLa Na,K-ATPase. The suspension was then treated with oligomycin (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 min at room temperature. Phosphorylation was then carried out in a total volume of 200 µl at 0 °C for 10 s with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmglycylglycine-Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 µm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 10,000–20,000 cpm/pmol). Base-line activity was determined by replacing 100 mm NaCl with 50 mm KCl and 50 mmcholine chloride and phosphorylating the enzyme in the absence of oligomycin. Assays for K+ dependence of K+-occlusion (E 1 + K+ ↔E 2(K)), where E 1 is the K+-free enzyme and E 2(K) is the occluded enzyme, and the rate of deocclusion (E 2(K) → E 1 + K+) were measured indirectly as described elsewhere (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with the modifications described by Therien and Blostein (17Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least two different membrane preparations were assayed, and the data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. Each value shown is the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. In the experiments described below, the properties of α2* and α3* are described in terms of their similarities or differences relative to the ubiquitous α1 isoform. Inorganic orthovanadate is a transition state analog of inorganic phosphate that binds to P-type ATPases in the form of the enzyme from which phosphate is released in theE 2 conformation (18Cantley Jr., L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, sensitivity of these enzymes to vanadate inhibition is a measure of the proportion of enzyme in the E 2 conformation during steady-state catalysis. Thus, for mutants of various P-type pumps, including plant and yeast proton pumps and the Na,K-ATPase, this criterion has provided insight into shifts in theE 1/E 2 distribution (for recent examples, see Refs. 19Ambesi A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). From the present comparative analysis of the vanadate sensitivity of the highly homologous α1, α2*, and α3* Na,K-ATPase isoforms, it is evident that the Na,K-ATPase activity of α2* is ∼20-fold less sensitive to vanadate inhibition than α1 (Fig.1A), suggesting a shift in the E1/E2 distribution toward E1. In contrast, no significant difference in vanadate sensitivity of α3* compared with α1 could be detected. Although the representative experiment shown in Fig. 1 A was carried out at 1 mm ATP and 3 mm MgCl2, similar results (not shown) were obtained at 3 mm ATP, with 5 mm MgCl2 added to maintain a 2 mmexcess of Mg2+ (IC50 values were 0.80 ± 0.15, 12.1 ± 4.3, and 1.2 ± 0.4 µm for α1, α2*, and α3*, respectively). Fig. 1 B shows that similar results were also obtained when pump turnover was measured in the absence of K+ (Na-ATPase activity), precluding effects of vanadate secondary to differences in interactions with K+. Catalytic turnover of the Na,K-ATPase is estimated as the ratio of V max toEPmax, the latter measured at 0 °C in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, with K+ omitted and oligomycin added to trap the enzyme in the (Na)E 1P state (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Table II, in the presence of K+ (Na,K-ATPase mode), the catalytic turnover of α2* is ∼40% that of α1 as observed previously (9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover of α3* is also lower (∼50% of α1). In contrast, when the turnover of Na-ATPase is estimated as the product of Na-ATPase/Na,K-ATPase andV max(Na,K-ATPase)/EPmax, the turnover of α3* is similar (20 mm Na+; Table II) or even higher (100 mm Na+; not shown) than that of α1, the former probably reflecting the lowerK′Na for α3*.

Shown are the mean values ± S.D. The pH sensitivity profile of Na,K-ATPase and its relevance to the issue of rate-limiting reaction(s) were addressed in earlier studies of Forbush and Klodos (22Forbush III, B. Klodos I. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1991; 46: 210-225PubMed Google Scholar). Their experiments showed that the pathway involving deocclusion of K+(E 2(K) → E 1) is partially rate-limiting at acidic pH, whereas theE 1 → E 1P andE 1P → E 2P processes are more rate-limiting at alkaline and neutral pH, respectively. In the present study, we compared the pH profiles of the three isoforms over the pH range of 6.0–8.5. As shown in Fig.2, the activity of all three isoforms declines as pH is decreased below or increased above the optimal. Compared with α1, the activity of α2* is diminished to a lesser extent at acidic pH and more at alkaline pH, consistent with relatively faster E 2(K) → E 1 and slower E 1 →→ E2P transitions and hence with a preponderance of enzyme in E 1state(s). Although the pH profile of α3* resembles that of α1 at acidic pH, it decreases more significantly than α1 on the alkaline side of the optimum, the significance of which is discussed below. Since the differences in ligand binding affinities of α3* and α1 hold true despite their similar sensitivities to vanadate, it may be inferred that α3* differs from α1 primarily in its interaction with alkali cation ligands. Nevertheless, certain aspects of α3* kinetic behavior have remained enigmatic and a further comparative analysis of ligand interactions was carried out to explore the mechanistic basis for α3*-specific properties. To determine whether α3* has an intrinsically lower affinity for Na+, ATP hydrolysis was measured in the absence of K+ and with the Na+concentration varied up to 10 mm to favor interactions primarily with cytoplasmic Na+ activation sites. Comparisons of α3* and α1 were carried out at pH values of 6.2, 7.4, and 8.0. The results shown in Fig. 3indicate that large differences in K′Na persist at all pH values tested, consistent with an intrinsic difference in apparent Na+ affinity between α1 and α3*. For α3* compared with α1, respectively, K′Na values were 0.125 ± 0.036 and 0.552 ± 0.018 mm at pH 6.2, 0.046 ± 0.005 and 0.335 ± 0.046 mm at pH 7.4, and 0.066 ± 0.030 and 0.753 ± 0.372 mm at pH 8.0 (p < 0.05 at all pH values). In the case of α1, Li+ can act as a congener of cytoplasmic Na+ as well as extracellular K+(24Blostein R. Pershadsingh H.A. Drapeau P. Chu L. Skou J.C. Norby J.G.

This finding underscores the large difference in cation selectivity of α3* compared with α1 or α2*. In an earlier study, we showed that K+ stimulates Na-ATPase activity of α2* at micromolar ATP concentration but inhibits both α1 and α3*. The explanation thatE 2(K) → E 1 of α2* is faster relative to other reactions of the cycle was substantiated by measurements of the E 2(K) →E 1 rate of α1 and α2* (9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With Li+ replacing K+, Na-ATPase activity of all three isoforms was stimulated in the order α2* ≈ α3* ≫ α1, consistent with Li+ acting as a congener of K+and with a known faster deocclusion compared with K+ (26Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the observation that K+ inhibits α1 and α3* to similar extents whereas Li+ stimulates α2* and α3* but not α1 suggests distinct properties of α3* with respect to interaction with extracellular alkali cations and/or the rate of another reaction step. Therefore, to gain insight into the basis for these isoform-distinct effects of Li+ and K+, we compared α3* and α1 with respect to rates of K+occlusion and deocclusion as described below. The K+ dependence for formation of the K+-occluded enzyme, E 1 + K+ ↔E 2(K), was measured indirectly as the decrease in phosphoenzyme (E 32P formed by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP) following equilibration of the enzyme in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of K+as described previously (9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23944-23948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The decrease inE 32P resulting from preincubation with K+ is a measure of the amount ofE 2(K+). Fig.5shows a representative K+-occlusion profile of α3* and α1. Using the simple model B max[S]/(K 0.5 + [S]) to describe K+ occlusion, whereB max is the maximally bound enzyme (28Shani M. Goldschleger R. Karlish S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the values of the equilibrium constant for K+ occlusion, K 0.5, were 0.031 ± 0.007 and 0.046 ± 0.008 mm for α1 and α3*, respectively, and, therefore, not significantly different (p > 0.5). (This contrasts with the ≥3-fold increase in K 0.5 for α2* compared with α1 (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).) Maximum formation of E 2(K) with both α1 and α3* was observed at 1 mm KCl as shown previously for α1 (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The rate of theE 2(K) → E 1 deocclusion process was estimated indirectly by measuring the rate ofE 1 formation from E 2(K) as described previously (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C891-C898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the representative experiment shown in Fig. 6indicate that the K+ deocclusion rate for α3*, similar to that determined earlier for α2* (11Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), is faster than that of α1. The fold increase obtained in three similar independent experiments was 3.4 ± 0.5. Since K 0.5 for K+occlusion is similar for α1 and α3*, the rate ofE 1 + K+ →→E 2(K) must also be 3-fold faster for α3*. The implication of the faster deocclusion vis-à-vis the effects of K+ on Na-ATPase at micromolar ATP concentration is considered below. In the present study, we have extended earlier comparisons of the rat α1, α2*, and α3* isoforms expressed in the same (HeLa) cell environment (8Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to gain insight into the mechanistic basis for their distinct behavior. The following discussion focuses on the properties of α2* and α3* as they relate to those of the ubiquitous α1 isoform. From a comparison with the ubiquitous α1 isoform, it is now clear that the main distinguishing property of the α2* isoform is its poise in conformational equilibrium in favor ofE 1 forms. There are several observations in support of this conclusion. Thus, earlier studies showed that theE 2(K) → E 1 transition associated with K+-deocclusion is faster for α2* than for α1 and that the apparent affinity for low affinity ATP binding is 2–3 times higher for α2* compared with α1 (8Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further supportive evidence is the present finding of a ∼20-fold increase in IC50 for vanadate inhibition of α2* compared with either α1 or α3*, indicating a shift in equilibrium away from theE 2 state(s). Another point of evidence is the α2*-distinct pH profile. As already discussed, the smaller decrease in activity of α2* at acidic pH and greater decrease at alkaline pH also implicate shifts of rates of partial reactions in favor ofE 1 form(s). It is noteworthy that the distinctive behavior of α2* vis-à-vis α1 is remarkably similar to the behavior of α1 mutants obtained by deletion of the first 32 residues from the amino terminus and by a Glu233 → Lys substitution in the cytoplasmic loop between M2 and M3. Generally similar differences from α1 were obtained in the aforementioned properties for these mutants, including fasterE 2(K) → E 1, slower catalytic turnover, lower K′ATP for low affinity ATP binding, and decreased sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase activity to vanadate inhibition, all leading to the conclusion that these are mutants with the E 1 ⇌E 2 equilibrium sh"

Because the incidence of homozygous α1-AT deficiency in Caucasian populations is relatively high (1 in 1600 to 1 in 2000 live births), this deficiency constitutes the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and the most frequent genetic diagnosis for which children undergo liver transplantation (reviewed in Ref. 1Perlmutter D.H Schiff E.R.

Deficiency of α1-AT is also associated with premature development of destructive lung disease/emphysema (1Perlmutter D.H Schiff E.R. Sorrell M.F. Maddrey W.C. Schiff's Diseases of the Liver. 8th Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1999: 1131-1150Google Scholar). The PI Z allele is characterized by a single nucleotide substitution that results in the substitution of lysine for glutamate at amino acid 342 (2Kidd V.J. Walker R.B. Itakura K. Woo S.L.C.

Emphysema is caused by lack of α1-AT in the lung, permitting neutrophil elastase to destroy the connective tissue matrix (reviewed in Refs. 13McElvaney N.G. Crystal R.G. Crystal R.G. West J.B.

In contrast to this loss-of-function mechanism for lung injury, liver disease is thought to involve a gain-of-function mechanism wherein the retention of the mutant polymerized α1-ATZ protein in the ER invokes damage to the affected liver cells (reviewed in Ref. 15Perlmutter D.H. Arias I.M. Boyer J. Chisari F. Fausto N. Schachter D. Shafritz D. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which retention of this aggregated glycoprotein elicits liver injury is unknown. By expressing mutant α1-ATZ in skin fibroblasts from α1-AT-deficient patients with liver disease (“susceptible hosts”) and comparing them with fibroblasts from α1-AT-deficient individuals without liver disease (“protected hosts”), we found that there is more efficient degradation of the mutant α1-ATZ molecule in the ER of protected hosts. These results have provided evidence for the concept that genetic/environmental mechanisms that impair the degradation pathways that constitute the quality control apparatus of the ER increase susceptibility to liver disease in α1-AT-deficient individuals (16Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this study we examined a family with two sibs having severe liver disease associated with homozygous α1-AT deficiency. The mother had died of presumed idiopathic liver disease many years earlier (α1-AT phenotype unknown). We found that one of the sibs was a compound heterozygote, with one PI Z allele and one allele with both the substitution that characterizes the PIZ allele and the substitution that characterizes the PI saar allele. Although the studies of this family do not substantiate the idea that the PI saar allele is associated with liver injury, studies of the intracellular fate of this mutant have important implications for understanding the mechanism of liver disease in α1-AT deficiency. The index patient, patient 1, developed gastrointestinal bleeding at 48 years of age. She was found to have esophageal varices and a diagnosis of α1-AT deficiency with a PIZ genotype and blood levels of α1-AT that were 8% normal. She initially underwent variceal sclerotherapy but later required a distal splenorenal shunt at age 50 for recurrent variceal bleeding. Symptoms of chronic liver failure necessitated a liver transplant at age 56 years. There was no history of significant alcohol exposure. The native liver was characterized by cirrhosis and periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant globules in liver parenchymal cells. Her brother, patient 2, was discovered to have splenomegaly at age 38 years. For unknown reasons he underwent a splenectomy shortly thereafter. At age 41 years he developed intestinal bleeding and was found to have esophageal and gastric varices. He was found to be homozygous for the PI Z allele with blood α1-AT levels 11% normal. He underwent a gastric devascularization procedure at that time. A liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis with periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant globules in liver cells. He had recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, developed hepatic encephalopathy, and died at age 46 after declining liver transplantation. He was not known to have had much exposure to alcohol. The mother of patients 1 and 2 died from severe liver failure of unknown etiology. There was no history of alcohol use for the mother. Another brother (patient 3) and two other sisters (patients 4 and 5) were available for further studies. For index patient 1, total cellular RNA was isolated from her native liver by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and ethanol precipitation (17Chirgwin T.M. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16608) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified with an Oligotex Column Kit (Qiagen) and then subjected to reverse transcriptase-PCR using primer A1-1 (sense), 5′-CTGTCTCCTCAGCTTCAGGCA-3′, and primer A1-1A (antisense), 5′-ATCACATGCAGGCAGGGACCA-3′. The 1.4-kilobase PCR fragment was gel-purified and subjected to direct sequence analysis. This PCR fragment was also subcloned into the pGME-T vector so that the sequence of each of the two α1-AT alleles could be determined. A total of eight subclones was subjected to sequence analysis, confirming the presence of compound heterozygosity with four subclones having identical sequence for each of the two alleles. Genomic DNA was isolated from skin fibroblasts of patient 2 and from blood of patients 3, 4, and 5 with the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen). This DNA was subjected to PCR for exon V using primer A1-G5 (sense), 5′-CTGGGATCAGCCTTACAACGTGT-3′, and A1-GR (antisense), 5′-TTCCCATGAAGAGGGGAGACTTG-3′. A 210-base pair PCR product was gel-purified for direct sequencing. To confirm the mutations, sequencing reactions in both directions were analyzed. Overlap PCR methods (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D.

Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) as template. The inner primer pair was sense, 5′-TCAGTCCCTTTCTCGTCGATGGT-3′, and antisense, 5′-TCAGTCCCTTTCTCGTCGATGGT-3′. The outer primer pair was sense, 5′-CTGACTAGTGACAGTGAATCGAC-3′, and antisense, 5′-GACTAGTTGAGGAGCGAGAGG-3′. Direct sequence analysis of each cDNA showed the presence of the intended mutation without any unintended mutation. These cDNA constructs were subcloned into the pRc/RSV expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate heterologous cell lines with stable expression of human wild type α1-AT, mutant α1-ATZ, mutant α1-AT saar, and mutant α1-ATZ + saar. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected separately by the calcium phosphate DNA-precipitation method with each of these vectors, and candidate clones were selected in G418. For pulse labeling, each of these cell lines was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in Tran35S-label (250 μCi/ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine). For pulse-chase radiolabeling, each of the cell lines was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in Tran35S-label (250 μCi/ml Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine) for the pulse period, rinsed extensively, and then incubated at 37 °C in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for the chase period. At specified time intervals, extracellular (EC) medium was harvested, and cells (IC) were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonic fluoride. EC and IC samples were clarified and immunoprecipitated, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography exactly as described previously (16Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K.

Aliquots of each sample were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation to ensure that there were equivalent levels of incorporation of radiolabel in each cell line at time 0 IC. Separate gels were also subjected to PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonic acid, and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE directly or to immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. Blots were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-human α1-AT and then with peroxidase-labeled strepavidin and were developed with the Supersignal substrate (Pierce). Cell lysates were passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle on ice (20Dul J.L. Davis D.P. Williamson E.K. Stevens F.J. Aargon Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. Pellets were solubilized in 50 μl of 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol with 1 min of sonication followed by 10 min of boiling. Cells were plated on glass slides, fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-α1-AT IgG as primary antibody and rhodamine-conjugated anti-Ig as secondary antibody and anti-GRP78/BiP Ig as primary antibody with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Ig as secondary antibody exactly as previously described (16Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cells stained with primary or secondary antibody alone were included as controls for background. Analysis of the coding sequence of the α1-AT gene in the index patient, patient 1, revealed on one allele the substitution of Glu342 GAG to Lys342 AAG, the substitution which characterizes the PI Z allele (Fig.1). On the other allele there was both Glu342 GAG to Lys342 AAG and Glu376GAA to TGA. The latter substitution results in a premature termination codon and truncation of 19 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2). Because this allele had the Ala-213 polymorphism it is classified as the α1-AT null Saarbrucken variant. Thus the index patient had one PIZ allele and one PI Z + saar allele. Analysis of the complete coding sequence of the α1-AT gene for the brother, patient 2, who died from liver failure revealed the Glu342 GAG to Lys342 AAG substitutions on both alleles, indicating that he was homozygous for PI Z. Analysis of the coding region of exon V of the α1-AT gene for patients 3, 4, and 5 revealed Glu342 GAG on one allele and Lys342 AAG on the other allele, indicating that they were PI MZ heterozygotes (Fig. 3). There was no evidence for the Glu376 GAA to TGA mutation that characterizes the PI saar allele in patients 2, 3, 4, and 5.Figure 2Map of the exon structure of theα1-AT gene showing the locations of the mutations that characterize the PI Z and PI saaralleles in exon V.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Pedigree of family in which the PI Z + saar allele was discovered.The dark areas represent the PI Z alleles,hatched areas represent PI Z + saaralleles, and clear areas represent PI M alleles.

Pt, patient.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the fate of these mutants, we generated stably transfected cell lines that express wild type α1-AT, α1-ATZ, α1-AT saar, and α1-ATZ + saar. First, we subjected these cell lines to continuous pulse labeling to determine the relative electrophoretic mobility in the cells and the cell culture fluid (IC and EC, respectively, in Fig. 4). The results show, in IC for wild type α1-AT, the presence of ∼52- and 55-kDa polypeptides. These correspond to the partially and fully glycosylated intracellular intermediates, respectively, that are usually observed for wild type α1-AT. The relative electrophoretic migration of the fully glycosylated 55-kDa polypeptide corresponds to that of mature α1-AT found in the EC fluid (center panel). For α1-AT saar there is a single 50-kDa polypeptide, reflecting faster electrophoretic migration due to carboxyl-terminal truncation. For α1-ATZ a single 52-kDa polypeptide, reflecting the partially glycosylated intermediate, accumulates in the IC. For α1-ATZ + saar a single truncated 50-kDa polypeptide is present. The greater intensity of α1-AT saar, α1-ATZ, and α1-ATZ + saar than of wild type α1-AT suggests the possibility that there is intracellular accumulation of all these mutants. The results of the EC samples show a marked decrease in the amount of the mutants, suggesting defective secretion. Longer fluorographic exposure of the EC (right panel) showed a trace amount of a slightly faster migrating polypeptide for saar and a little bit more of the 55-kDa polypeptide for Z but no detectable polypeptide for Z + saar. Next we examined the kinetics of secretion of α1-AT in these cell lines using pulse-chase radiolabeling (Fig.5). For wild type α1-AT, ∼52- and 55-kDa polypeptides are present at time 0 IC. These polypeptides disappear between 1 and 4 h of the chase period coincident with the appearance of the mature 55-kDa polypeptide EC. For α1-ATZ, the ∼52-kDa polypeptide is present at time 0 IC. It disappears from IC much more slowly than wild type α1-AT. A lesser amount of the mature 55-kDa polypeptide appears EC, later in the chase period. These results show that the genetically engineered cell lines faithfully recapitulate the known abnormal fate of α1-ATZ in the classical form of α1-AT deficiency with defective secretion and intracellular retention. For α1-AT saar and α1-ATZ + saar, the single ∼50-kDa polypeptide undergoes even less disappearance from IC during the chase period, and no α1-AT is detected EC. These results indicate that truncation of the carboxyl terminus of α1-AT results in intracellular retention. When the Z allele is truncated there appears to be even less secretion of the protein. To more definitively compare the fate of α1-ATZ and α1-AT saar, we carried out pulse-chase radiolabeling for even longer time intervals (Fig. 6). For α1-ATZ the results show slow but progressive disappearance from IC between 2 and 8 h of the chase period with a small amount of mature α1-AT appearing EC between 5 and 8 h. For α1-AT saar, there is relatively little disappearance from IC throughout the chase period, but some disappearance does occur between 5 and 8 h, indicating that intracellular retention of this mutant is as great as or even greater than that of α1-ATZ. Again, no detectable α1-AT saar is observed in the EC fluid even after 8 h of the chase period. Results for α1-ATZ + saar were similar to these for α1-AT saar (data not shown). To determine whether α1-AT saar and α1-ATZ + saar accumulate in the ER, the stably transfected CHO cell lines were subjected to immunofluorescence with antibody to α1-AT and antibody to GRP78/BiP as a marker for the ER (Fig.7 A). The results show that antibody to α1-AT only faintly stains the perinuclear region in CHO cells transfected with wild type α1-AT. However, in CHO cells transfected with α1-ATZ, α1-AT saar, and α1-ATZ + saar, antibody to α1-AT brightly stains the cytoplasm in a reticular pattern accentuated in the perinuclear region. Staining with antibody to GRP78/BiP stains an identical region in CHO cells transfected with wild type α1-AT, α1-ATZ, α1-AT saar, and α1-ATZ + saar. In Fig.7 B, staining for α1-AT co-localized with that for BiP by double-label immunofluorescence in CHO cells transfected with α1-ATZ + saar. Staining for α1-AT also co-localized with that for BiP in CHO cells transfected with α1-ATZ and α1-AT saar (data not shown). These results provide evidence that α1-AT saar and α1-ATZ + saar are retained in the ER. Next we examined the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions from transfected CHO cells to determine whether α1-AT saar formed insoluble aggregates. Each of the cell lines was subjected to a pulse-chase experiment, and then the cell lysates were analyzed for α1-AT after separation into soluble and insoluble fractions (Fig.8). The results show that insoluble material is only present in CHO cells expressing mutant α1-ATZ. There is no detectable α1-AT in the pellet from CHO cells expressing wild type α1-AT, α1-AT saar, or α1-ATZ + saar. The separation of soluble and insoluble fractions from cells expressing mutant α1-ATZ provides particularly informative results. In the soluble fraction α1-ATZ is retained between time 0 and time 1 h of the chase period and then progressively disappears from 1 to 2 h and then from 2 to 4 h of the chase period. In contrast, there is a marked increase in α1-ATZ accumulating in the insoluble fraction from time 0 to 1 h and then even more from 1 to 2 h of the chase period with some disappearance beginning between 2 and 4 h. The lack of α1-ATZ + saar in the insoluble fraction implies that truncation at the carboxyl terminus converts the α1-ATZ variant into a nonpolymerogenic mutant. Soluble and insoluble fractions were also subjected to Western blot analysis to determine steady state levels of soluble and insoluble α1-AT (Fig. 8 B). The results show that all of the wild type α1-AT, mutant α1-AT saar, and mutant α1-ATZ + saar partitions into the soluble fraction. Mutant α1-AT saar and α1-ATZ + saar migrate faster than wild type α1-AT and mutant α1-ATZ, as would be expected from carboxyl terminal truncation. Increased levels of soluble mutant α1-AT saar, α1-ATZ, and α1-ATZ + saar compared with soluble wild type α1-AT are expected because of the intracellular accumulation of all of these mutants. Only mutant α1-ATZ appears in the insoluble fraction (right panel). Densitometric analysis of the results of five different samples indicates that 17.0 ± 1.9% of α1-ATZ is found in the insoluble fraction at steady state. Extensive clinical experience with α1-AT deficiency has shown that there is marked variability in the development and severity of liver disease among homozygotes for the PI Z allele, patients with the classical form of this disease. Prospective nationwide screening studies carried out in Sweden have confirmed that only ∼10% of this population develops clinically significant liver disease (21Sveger T. Pediatrics. 1978; 62: 22-25PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sveger T. Eriksson S. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 514-517PubMed Google Scholar). Using a genetic complementation approach, we found that there is less efficient ER degradation of α1-ATZ in cells from some α1-AT-deficient individuals who are susceptible to liver disease (16Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and, therein, that these individuals have a lesser inherent capacity to respond to, and/or protect themselves from, the hepatotoxic circumstances posed by ER retention of mutant α1-ATZ. In this study we examined a potentially informative family in which a pair of sibs had severe liver disease associated with the classical form of α1-AT deficiency. There was also a history of severe idiopathic liver disease in the mother, which could not be attributed to known hepatotoxic exposures including alcohol. Unfortunately, we have been unable to establish a skin fibroblast cell line from the index patient to determine whether she has delayed ER degradation of α1-ATZ, but we do know that skin fibroblasts from her brother have delayed ER degradation of α1-ATZ (16Wu Y. Whitman I. Molmenti E. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We decided to analyze the sequence of theα1-AT gene in these sibs. To our surprise the index patient from the family has an unusual compound heterozygous mutation of the α1-AT with one PI Z allele and a second allele with a combination of the Z and saar mutations, the PI Z +saar allele. This result raised the possibility that the presence of a PI saar allele, or a PI Z + saarallele, represents a genetically linked mechanism for susceptibility to liver disease. Although we cannot completely exclude this possibility, it is an unlikely one because one of these alleles was not found in the brother, patient 2, in whose fibroblasts there is delayed ER degradation of α1-ATZ. Thus, one of these alleles is not even linked to the liver disease phenotype in this family. The presence of the saar mutation on one of the α1-AT alleles of patient 1 also prompted us to examine the fate of α1-AT saar in a heterologous mammalian cell expression system. The results show that there is prolonged ER retention of α1-AT saar, perhaps even more prolonged than that of α1-ATZ, even though it does not form insoluble polymers. Previous studies have shown that there is ER retention of the PI Clayton allele, which has the same truncation on the background of another polymorphic variant of α1-AT (23Brantly M. Lee J.H.

Biol. 1997; 16: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), α1-AT Hong Kong, in which the carboxyl terminus is truncated by 61 amino acids (24Sifers R.N. Brashears-Macatee S. Kidd V.J.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7330-7335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a recombinant α1-AT molecule in which the carboxyl terminus is truncated by four amino acids (25Brodbeck R.M. Brown J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 294-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was particularly interesting to observe that when the α1-ATZ molecule is truncated, as it would be in the PI Z + saar allele found in our index patient, it no longer forms insoluble aggregates but is retained in the ER for a prolonged, perhaps every more prolonged, time interval. These results provide further evidence that there are mechanisms by which mutant α1-AT molecules are retained in the ER other than the polymerization mechanism that has been correlated previously with ER retention of α1-ATZ (7Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 8Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A.

By comparing the effects of the polymerogenic mutant α1-ATZ with those of nonpolymerogenic mutants such as α1-AT saar and α1-ATZ + saar, which are retained in the ER to a similar extent, we may be able in future studies to ascertain whether it is the intrinsic polymerogenic properties that are hepatotoxic in some patients with α1-AT deficiency. We are indebted to Marilyn Maksin for preparing the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2076107014,"During the use of tetrapeptide and other proprietary caspase inhibitors in the study of neurodegeneration, we had concluded that mechanisms other than the inhibition of caspases contributed to the protective effects of certain caspase inhibitors. Here we report our studies to identify a target for and hence a mechanism by which the tetrapeptide inhibitor tyrosine-valine-alanine-aspartate-chloromethyl ketone (Ac-YVAD-cmk) is able to rescue neuronal cell cultures from cell death. Ac-YVAD-cmk rescued neuronal cells from cell death in response to oxidative stress and oxygen/glucose deprivation. Affinity labeling with biotinylated YVAD-cmk demonstrated distinct binding proteins for the inhibitor in cells from the central nervous system versus Jurkat cells. Binding to the novel target protein was displaced by class-specific protease inhibitors and suggested that the target is a cysteine protease. Affinity purification and sequencing identified the target as cathepsin-B. Cathepsin-B inhibitors competed with biotinylated YVAD-cmk for the target protein. The availability of the target for binding was reduced in cells that had been rescued by unlabeled inhibitor. Cathepsin-B inhibitors rescue hippocampal slices from cell death induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation. These data provide evidence to support a role for cathepsin-B in neuronal cell death, particularly that following ischemia."

It was proposed that the I4897T mutation was leaky, depleting Ca2+ stores. However, a later study of the I4897T mutant, expressed in dyspedic myotubes, demonstrated a functional uncoupling of sarcolemmal excitation from Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (24Avila G.

In that study, Ca2+ stores were reported to be similar when wt RyR1 or I4897T mutant RyR1 were expressed in the dyspedic myotubes.

In support of this proposal, the mutation G4824A in mouse RyR2 reduced single-channel conductance from 798 pS for the wild type channel to 22 pS (27Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J.

Agents such as Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, caffeine, ruthenium red, and ryanodine modulated the mutant channel. Co-expression of wild type and G4824A mutant proteins yielded single channels with intermediate unitary conductances. Several mutations in this region also abolished high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding. Selected mutations in this region or in adjacent regions in RyR1 altered channel conductance in a separate study, but some of these mutations were otherwise unregulated in single-channel recordings (28Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, we carried out systematic Ala or Ala to Val scanning mutagenesis of all amino acids in this highly conserved and disease-inducing region. Mutant channel function was analyzed by measurement of ligand-induced Ca2+ release in transfected HEK-293 cells using Ca2+ photometry, [3H]ryanodine binding in whole cell extracts, and single-channel recordings with partially purified proteins. We found alterations in regulation and in caffeine and ryanodine modulation of the channels, alterations in conductivity and ion selectivity, and abnormal interactions between ryanodine and caffeine that imply a close relationship between the effects of these two modulators. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA modifying enzymes were from Stratagene, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, Promega, and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (AM) was from Molecular Probes; caffeine and protease inhibitors were from Sigma; [3H]ryanodine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; unlabeled ryanodine was from Calbiochem; CHAPS was from Bio-Rad; soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) was from Northern Lipids. The expression vector pcDNA 3.1(−) was from Invitrogen. Monoclonal antibody C3-33 was from Affinity Bioagents. All other reagents were of reagent grade or highest grade available. Site-directed mutagenesis of the pore region residues was carried out in a small fragment (SacI-BglII, 13602–14526) of RyR2 cDNA by Pfu polymerase-based polymerase chain reaction using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene). The complete sequence of the mutated fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment with the desired mutation was subcloned back into its original position in RyR2 by three steps of subcloning: to a vector containingSacI-BspEI (13602–14880), then to a vector containing fragment SacII-XhoI (11206–15360), and, finally, to the full-length RyR2 in the pcDNA expression vector.

In brief, about 50 µg of protein were added to a binding buffer composed of 0.5 m KCl, 1 mm ATP, 100 µm free Ca2+, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, and various concentrations of [3H]ryanodine in a total volume of 0.25 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 2 h at 37 °C, the samples were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold washing buffer composed of 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, and 0.25 m KCl and placed on Whatman GF/B membrane filters pre-soaked with 1% polyethyleneimine in washing buffer. Filters were washed three times with 6 ml of washing buffer. [3H]Ryanodine bound to the filter was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. All binding assays were carried out in duplicate. The pellet obtained after centrifugation at 45,000 × g (see above) was solubilized for 1 h in a buffer composed of 1 m NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 5 mg/ml PC, a mix of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm AEBSF, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 µg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and E64) and 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was placed on the top of a 7–25% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient solution containing 50 mm Tris-HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.3% CHAPS, 0.15% PC, and the protease inhibitor mix, and was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-40 rotor for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Fractions of about 0.75 ml each were collected from bottom to top and subjected to direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibody C3-33 to determine the portion that contained RyR protein. The fractions with peak immmunoreactivity were collected and stored at −70 °C. Single-channel activities were recorded after incorporation of sucrose density gradient-purified wild type and mutant RyR2 proteins into a planar lipid bilayer. The bilayer was formed by painting a lipid mixture (5:3 phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylcholine, 35 mg/ml) across a 200-µm hole in a Delrin partition separating two chambers (Warner Instrument Corp.). The trans chamber was connected to the head stage input of an amplifier (model EPC-7, List Electronics). Thecis chamber was virtually grounded. Unless stated otherwise, single-channel recordings were obtained with a symmetrical solution containing 250 mm KCl and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After formation of the bilayer, a 3-µl aliquot of the sample was added to the cis chamber with continuous stirring of both chambers. Voltage commands to the amplifier were given through a Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments Inc.). Recordings were filtered at 1 kHz before being acquired at 5 kHz by the Digidata 1200. Ca2+ photometric data were analyzed with Felix software (Photon Technologies Inc.). Single-channel recording data were analyzed using pClamp 7.0 software (Axon Instruments inc.). Scatchard analysis was used to determine the dissociation constant (K d) and maximal binding capacity (B max) from equilibrium binding data. EC50 values were obtained by fitting the curves with an equation for logistic dose response using Microcal Origin software (Microcal Software Ltd., Northampton, MA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. A paired or unpaired Student t test was used for evaluation of the mean values. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In this study, most residues in the highly conserved sequence GVRAGGGIGD4831 in RyR2 were mutated to the small, non-polar residue Ala, Ala4825 was mutated to Val, and Ile4829, the residue equivalent to Ile4897 in RyR1, was mutated to Ala and Val and to Thr, a mutation that causes a clinically severe form of central core disease in humans (10Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant RyR2 cDNAs were transfected transiently into HEK-293 cells. All proteins were expressed at readily detectable levels, as judged by functional assays such as caffeine-induced Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding and by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting of whole cell lysates with monoclonal antibody C3-33 (data not shown). Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm. Changes in the 340/380 ratio provided a measure of ligand-induced Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells transfected with wt or mutant RyR2 (30Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since the measurement was carried out by photometry, resting intracellular Ca2+levels could not be measured accurately. No significant Ca2+ release was observed with caffeine up to 30 mm in pcDNA-transfected cells (30Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was readily observed in cells transfected transiently with wt RyR2. Figs.1(A–C) show representative traces of fluorescence changes for wt, V4823A, and G4828A that represent changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to incremental application of 0.03–30 mm caffeine. Ca2+ release occurred with 0.03–0.1 mmcaffeine for wt and mutant V4823A, but was seen only with concentrations of caffeine above 3 mm for G4828A. Peak fluorescence amplitudes were measured following the incremental application of 0.03–30 mm caffeine and normalized to the peak amplitude for maximal Ca2+ release induced by 30 mm caffeine. Since caffeine at concentrations as high as 50 or 100 mm quenched fluorescence of the dye, a proper value for maximal Ca2+ release could not be obtained at these concentrations of caffeine. EC50 values were calculated by fitting the caffeine dose-response curves with an equation for logistic dose response. Dose-response curves for wt and mutant RyR2 proteins are shown in Fig. 1 D, and EC50 values are summarized in the inset to Fig. 1 D. No caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was observed for mutants I4829A and I4829T, as reported previously (10Lynch P.J. Tong J. Lehane M. Mallet A. Giblin L. Heffron J.J. Vaughan P. Zafra G. MacLennan D.H. McCarthy T.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). When I4829A and 4829T were co-expressed with wild type RyR2 (in a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1), the heterozygotes responded to caffeine with normal EC50 (data not shown). Mutants G4822A, R4824A, G4826A, G4828A, and D4831A displayed decreased caffeine sensitivity, while mutant V4823A displayed increased caffeine sensitivity. Mutants A4825V, G4827A, I4829V, and G4830A retained normal caffeine sensitivity. Hill coefficients for mutants with normal or increased caffeine sensitivity were close to the wt value of 1.1, while Hill coefficients for mutants with decreased caffeine sensitivity were near 2, indicating co-operativity for caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. Higher Hill coefficient in these mutants could also result from a miscalculation of maximal release, since we were unable to establish saturation for caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in these mutants for the reason outlined above. As shown previously (30Du G.G. Imredy J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33259-33266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 10 or even 100 µmryanodine did not elicit Ca2+ release in wt RyR2-transfected cells (Figs.2A and3A) or pcDNA-transfected cells (data not shown) over a period of 3–4 min. Under the same conditions, no Ca2+ release was induced by 10 µm ryanodine in cells transfected with mutants G4822A, G4828A, I4829A, I4829T, I4829V, G4830A, and D4831A (Figs. 2(B, H, and I–K) and 3 (Band C). By contrast, ryanodine induced Ca2+release in cells transfected with mutants V4823A, R4824A, A4825V, G4826A, and G4827A (Fig. 2, C–G). The most significant Ca2+ release occurred in mutants R4824A and G4827A (Fig. 2,D and G). When mutants I4829A and I4829T were co-expressed with wt RyR2 in a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, Ca2+release was induced by ryanodine in the heterozygote-transfected cells (data not shown).Figure 3Ryanodine-enhanced caffeine-induced Ca 2+ release in cells transfected with mutants I4829A and I4829T. Representative traces of Ca2+fluorescence measurements used to monitor the changes in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in response to 10 mmcaffeine and 10 µm ryanodine in HEK-293 cells expressing RyR2 (A), I4829A (B), or I4829T (C). Two responses of similar amplitude were obtained following the addition of 10 mm caffeine to HEK-293 cells expressing RyR2 (A) were obtained before the addition of 10 µmryanodine. The subsequent addition of 10 mm caffeine caused one Ca2+ release similar to that before the addition of ryanodine, but subsequent responses to caffeine were blocked. Mutants I4829A (B) and I4829T (C) were not responsive to caffeine at concentrations up to 30 mm as shown in Fig.1 D. However, 10 mm caffeine induced Ca2+ release following the addition of 10 µmryanodine. The amplitude of subsequent caffeine-induced Ca2+ release transients was gradually diminished.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of ryanodine on caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was then examined in wt and mutant RyR2. Caffeine-induced Ca2+release could be obtained repeatedly in wt-transfected cells, provided that caffeine was washed out between applications. The first application of 10 mm caffeine after the addition of ryanodine induced a Ca2+ release phase with undiminished amplitude (Fig. 3 A). The amplitude of Ca2+release in response to further caffeine challenges was greatly diminished and eventually was lost (Figs. 2 A and3 A). Similar results were obtained for cells transfected with mutants G4822A, V4823A, R4824A, A4825V, G4826A, G4827A, I4829V, G4830A, and D4831A (Fig. 2, B, C,E–G, and I–K). By contrast, caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in cells transfected with mutant G4828A (Fig.2 H) was resistant to ryanodine inhibition. Moreover, the amplitude of caffeine-induced Ca2+ release was increased by 51% (± 19%, n = 3) after treatment of 10 µm ryanodine in cells transfected with mutant G4828A (Fig. 2 H). A ryanodine-induced increase in caffeine-induced Ca2+release was most obvious in cells transfected with mutants I4829A and I4829T (Fig. 3, B and C). In the homozygous form, cells transfected with mutant I4829A or I4829T did not respond to caffeine concentrations as high as 30 mm nor to ryanodine at 10 µm. However, when 10 µm ryanodine was applied before caffeine, 10 mm caffeine elicited significant Ca2+ release. Caffeine-induced Ca2+release could be inhibited by continued incubation with 10 µm ryanodine. These results are summarized in TableI.Table ISummary of results for caffeine- and ryanodine-induced Ca2+release in transfected HEK-293 cell and [3H]ryanodine binding to recombinant expressed wt and mutant RyR2Caffeine-induced Ca2+releaseCaffeine sensitivityRyanodine binding (K d)Ryanodine-induced Ca2+releaseEffect of ryanodine on caffeine activationnmWt RyR2+1-a+, positive response.N1-bN, normal.2.2ND1-cND, not detected.↓1-d↓, decreased.G4822A+↓NDND↓V4823A+↑1-e↑, increased.ND+↓R4824A+↓ND+↓A4825V+NND+↓G4826A+↓2.0+↓G4827A+NND+↓G4828A+↓NDND↑I4829AND↓NDND↑I4829TND↓NDND↑I4829V+N3.3ND↓G4830A+N3.5ND↓D4831A+↓NDND↓1-a +, positive response.1-b N, normal.1-c ND, not detected.1-d ↓, decreased.1-e ↑, increased. Open table in a new tab The equilibrium properties of [3H]ryanodine binding to mutant RyRs were measured to determine whether the high affinity ryanodine binding site was preserved. Surprisingly, high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding could not be detected in most of the mutants. Scatchard analysis showed a single binding site only in mutants G4826A, I4829V, and G4830A (Fig. 4A).K d values for these mutants were similar to wild type RyR2 (Ref. 30Du G.G. Imredy J.P.

These data indicate that the high affinity ryanodine binding site is normal only in mutants G4826A, I4829V, and G4830A. The Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding was also determined for each mutant (Fig. 4 B). EC50 values (pCa) for Ca2+ activation for mutants G4826A, I4829V, and G4830A were 6.06, 6.01, and 6.01, respectively, compared with 5.98 for wt. No significant [3H]ryanodine binding was observed for the other mutants in the presence of Ca2+ at concentrations up to 1.5 pCa units, even when supplemented by 10 mm caffeine and 3 mm ATP, which enhance channel opening (data not shown). Single-channel conductance, gating, modulation, and permeability were determined for wt RyR2 and most of the mutants using the planar lipid bilayer method with K+ as the current carrier.

https://openalex.org/W2048254999,"Syndecan-4 is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) expressed widely in mammalian cells. It has been implicated in growth-factor binding, cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, and tissue damage responses. Although several HSPGs are present within kidney mesangium and glomerular basement membranes, no data are available on the synthesis of syndecan-4 by mesangial cells or its expression in human renal disease. We examined renal biopsy specimens from normal controls, nonproliferative disease (thin-membrane disease), and progressive proliferative disease (IgA nephropathy). By using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, we identified an increase in both gene expression (IgA nephropathy vs. thin membrane disease, P = 0.0004) and synthesis of syndecan-4 in progressive proliferative disease. Syndecan-4 increased within both mesangium and tubulo-interstitium, as did a-actinin, a microfilament cytoskeletal component. Syndecan-4 was a focal adhesion component in human mesangial cells, colocalizing with vinculin and a-actinin, and was present in the cortical, submembraneous myosin sheath as seen for a-actinin. Both syndecan-4 and a-actinin were retained selectively in detergent-resistant cytoskeleton-matrix preparations, emphasizing their close association in cell-matrix adhesion. Syndecan-4 may be important in the adhesion, migration, and proliferation of HMC, and its up-regulation could indicate proliferative disease."

Importantly, the modeling studies showed a close association between the NH2 and COOH termini of the peptide, predicting significant enhancement of the potency of inhibition by cyclization. Cyclic compounds were synthesized and indeed showed 5–50-fold increased potency over the linear peptide in anEscherichia coli membrane assay. Furthermore, the potency of inhibition correlated with steady-state binding of the cyclic peptides to sPLA2-IIA as determined by surface plasmon resonance studies.

The precise pathological role of sPLA2-IIA in inflammation requires further elucidation, and the relative role of other known mammalian isoforms of sPLA2 in these disorders is also not clear. sPLA2-V is essential for agonist-induced immediate prostaglandin release in rodent mast cells and a murine macrophage cell line in vitro (19Balboa M.A. Balsinde J.

This hydrophobic channel binds a single phospholipid molecule following interfacial binding of the enzyme to the aggregated phospholipid surface. Many potent inhibitors of sPLA2 bind in the channel, thus preventing substrate binding (26Scott D.L. White S.P. Browning J.L. Rosa J.J. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B.

The peptide70FLSYK74 of human sPLA2-IIA was originally identified as a result of copurification with the NH2-terminal peptide 1NLVNFHR7 on HPLC analysis following tryptic digestion of human sPLA2-IIA. From the crystal structure of native human sPLA2-IIA, the native pentapeptide sequence70FLSYK74 is closely associated with the NH2-terminal helix with the side chain of Tyr-73 buried on the internal face of the helix. Because the N-terminal helix of sPLA2 is known to be important for enzyme activity, we postulated and subsequently showed that exogenous addition of the 70–74 pentapeptide sequence inhibits enzyme activity. We propose that unlike active site inhibitors, these peptides inhibit by binding to the NH2-terminal helix of sPLA2-IIA, thereby interfering with a conformational change that occurs in the NH2-terminal helix of the enzyme during interfacial binding to the substrate (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The current studies describe the use of analogue screens, molecular modeling, and peptide-protein interaction analysis approaches to characterize the structural features of the peptide that are important for inhibition, to design more potent peptide-based inhibitors of human sPLA2-IIA, and to further characterize the mechanism of interaction of the peptide with the enzyme. sPLA2-IIA was purified from conditioned medium from a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (5A2) stably transfected with human sPLA2-IIA cDNA (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 10-liter fermentation chambers for 72 h, conditioned medium was harvested, and cell pellets were extracted with 1.0m NaCl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Recombinant sPLA2-IIA was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography on an AKTAexplorer system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). To generate the affinity column, anti-sPLA2-IIA monoclonal antibody 10B2 (31Smith G.M. Ward R.L. McGuigan L. Rajkovic I.A. Scott K.F. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 31: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Bioquest Ltd., Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) was coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditioned medium, brought to 1.0m NaCl with solid NaCl, and the 1.0 m NaCl extract of the cell pellets were centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C prior to immunoaffinity chromatography. The column was washed with at least 20 column volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 m NaCl prior to elution of sPLA2-IIA with 0.1 m glycine, 1.0m NaCl. sPLA2-IIA was eluted into tubes containing 3.0 m Tris base to immediately buffer the enzyme back to neutral pH. sPLA2-IIA was further concentrated by centrifugation using Ultrafree centrifugal units (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The enzyme was quantified by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (31Smith G.M. Ward R.L. McGuigan L. Rajkovic I.A. Scott K.F. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 31: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and filter-sterilized through Acrodisc 0.2 µm syringe filters (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant sPLA2-IIA was visualized as a single 14-kDa band on silver-stained 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Novex Novel Experimental Technology, San Diego; Silver Stain Kit, Bio-Rad) and its identity confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The preparations contained less than 0.1 ng of endotoxin/µg sPLA2-IIA protein in the assay (LimulusAmebocyte Lysate Pyrochrome Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Falmouth, MA). Enzyme activity was evaluated with an in vitro assay using a [3H]arachidonate-labeledEscherichia coli membrane assay as described previously (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified sPLA2-IIA had an EC50of 0.52 ± 0.08 nm in this assay. Peptide synthesis was generally carried out usingt-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry on a solid phase synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 430A) followed by hydrogen fluoride cleavage (Auspep, Melbourne, Australia). Some peptides were supplied by Chiron Mimotopes (Melbourne, Australia) or Auspep. Cyclic peptides were assembled using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry without removal of side-chain protection groups prior to cleavage from the resin. Peptides were cyclized by amide bond formation using standard peptide synthesis activation and coupling chemistry prior to deprotection (Auspep). All peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC. Peptide purity and identity were confirmed by mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, and where possible, by NH2-terminal sequence analysis. sPLA2 enzyme activity was measured using a 96-well formatted 3H-labeledE. coli membrane assay as described (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 96-well microtiter plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 16 h at 4 °C. Plates were washed twice with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Enzyme (0.2 nm) and peptides at varying concentrations were incubated in 50 µl of assay buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of 50 µl of substrate (autoclaved ]5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15-3H]arachidonate-labeled E. coli suspension (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) resuspended in assay buffer). Final reaction conditions were 12.6 µmPi. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the reaction stopped by the addition of HCl (25 µl, 4 m) and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (25 µl, 40 mg/ml). An aliquot (50 µl) of each sample was transferred to a second microtiter plate to determine total counts/min in the assay. The remaining sample was centrifuged (1300 × g, 15 min) and supernatant (50 µl) removed to measure arachidonic acid release. Radioactivity in both samples was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Topcount, Packard), and enzyme activity was expressed as percentage of hydrolysis. Porcine pancreatic sPLA2-IB (Sigma), Naja naja sPLA2-IB (Sigma), or Crotalus durissussPLA2-IIA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sydney, Australia) were used in peptide inhibition studies at dilutions (1/5000, no dilution and 1/5000, respectively) that resulted in equivalent enzyme activity as the concentration of human sPLA2-IIA used in these studies determined by serial dilution experiments. Peptide inhibition was analyzed by unweighted least squares curve fitting to a single site inhibition model using MINIM 3 (R. D. Purves, Pharmacology Department, University of Otago, New Zealand) and Quasi-Newton methods as described (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). R 0 andI max were fixed at 100. Data were normalized relative to the activity of a control reaction containing enzyme and substrate but no peptide in each experiment. Peptides were evaluated relative to a positive control synthetic peptide, 70FLSYK74 (derived from human sPLA2-IIA), and a negative control peptide,70TYSYT74 (derived from Crotalus atrox sPLA2-IIA), included in each assay. The IC50 of FLSYK under these conditions ranged from 300 to 600 µm between assays. The potency of inhibition of test peptides relative to FLSYK was consistent between replicate assays. Automated fixed-docking methodology was provided by the docking module of Insight II and Discover (39Molecular Simulations Inc. Insight II and Discover Users Guide, Version 95.0. Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar). This method is implemented in Biosym tool command language and was extended to be able to activate all torsion bonds defined by non-hydrogen atoms. A multiple start was also implemented so that bias from starting considerations, should any exist, would be negated or minimized. Unless otherwise stated, default values of the original implementation were used. The FLSYK peptide was docked onto the human sPLA2-IIA structure (26Scott D.L. White S.P. Browning J.L. Rosa J.J. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1991; 254: 1007-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (accession code 1POD (32Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F.J. Brice M.D. Rogers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8162) Google Scholar)). Twenty-four torsion angles were included in the Monte Carlo algorithm along with six global translational and rotational parameters. The starting position of the FLSYK was the same conformation found in the protein but positioned immediately adjacent to the sequence in the human sPLA2-IIA. Each subsequent conformation in the trajectory was calculated with 300 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization using the consistent valence force field (cvff). Each docked conformation was saved only if the energy of the FLSYK conformer was within 10 kcal of the last saved conformation and the root mean square deviation of the conformer relative to any previously found conformation was ≥0.5 Å. The maximum translational move distance was set at 3.0 Å, and energy minimization was not performed if the structure resulting from the random move was more than 1000 kcal higher than the last minimized structure. The trajectory was analyzed to identify the residues of sPLA2-IIA contacting the peptide in each conformation. In this calculation an interaction was defined as at least one van der Waals or hydrogen bond interaction between any two atoms of the peptide and sPLA2-IIA. The definition of van der Waals interactions used was a C–C distance of 4 Å. Hydrogen bond definitions were those of Insight II. Synthetic peptide mixtures derived from noncovalent association experiments were analyzed by chromatography on a 1090M Hewlett Packard HPLC (100 mm x 2.1 mm inner diameter Hypersil ODS column, 28 °C, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, linear 25-min gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile/water (90/10 v/v) containing 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid) as described (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequence analysis was performed on a pulsed liquid amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 120A). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were made using a BIAcore 2000 (BIACORE AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Human sPLA2-IIA, porcine pancreatic sPLA2-IB (Sigma), or the murine monoclonal antibody 81193 (nonreactive with human tissues, subclass IgG1, Bioquest Ltd.) were immobilized on a chip to a density of 1500–2000 pg mm−2 as described (33Shen B.-J. Hage T. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using BIACORE 2000 control software v3.1 (BIACORE AB). The fourth cell on each chip was activated and immediately blocked and used as a nonspecific binding blank. Ligand binding was analyzed at 25 °C by perfusion of peptides dissolved in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20) at various concentrations and at flow rates of 10–45 µl min−1. Binding was analyzed with BIAevaluate version 3.0.2.b (BIACORE AB). Human rheumatoid synoviocytes were obtained and isolated as described (34Bidgood M.J. Jamal O.S. Cunningham A.M. Brooks P.M. Scott K.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using procedures approved by the St. Vincent's Hospital Ethics Committee and used between passage 4 and 10. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL, Melbourne, Australia) in the absence of antibiotics. For all treatments, cells received fresh medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (endotoxin-free, fatty acid free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) prior to stimulation. Cells were costimulated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (10 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) together with purified sPLA2-IIA (70 nm) for 18 h as described (34Bidgood M.J. Jamal O.S. Cunningham A.M. Brooks P.M. Scott K.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of cyclic peptides. Peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) as vehicle and used so that vehicle concentration was 0.1% in cell culture media. The effect of peptides on synoviocyte viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for prostaglandin E2by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Sydney, Australia) as described (34Bidgood M.J. Jamal O.S. Cunningham A.M. Brooks P.M. Scott K.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2790-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The pentapeptide sequence 70FLSYK74, derived from residues 70–74 of human sPLA2-IIA, dose-dependently inhibits the activity of human sPLA2-IIA but shows no inhibition of enzymes of the same PLA2 subclass from the rattlesnake species C. atrox or C. durissus (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These latter enzymes are, in turn, inhibited by pentapeptide sequences (70TVSYT74 or70WDIYR74, respectively) derived from equivalent region of their respective sPLA2-IIA enzymes. Thus, each peptide specifically inhibits only the enzyme from which it is derived (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine which features of the FLSYK sequence are important for human sPLA2-IIA inhibition, peptides containing single side-chain substitutions were synthesized and tested in a high throughput enzyme activity screen relative to the control peptide FLSYK. Three classes of inhibitor were identifiable in this screen. The first were peptides that were noninhibitory (Fig.1A), the second were peptides that reproducibly showed inhibition in the assay (IC50>600 µm) but were less potent than the control FLSYK peptide (Fig. 1 B), and the third were peptides that showed inhibition comparable to the control peptide (Fig. 1 C). Importantly, the control peptide, FLSYK, was not inhibitory when porcine sPLA2-IB (Supplementary Data Fig. 1), N. naja sPLA2-IB, or C. durissussPLA2-IIA (data not shown) were used in the assay at an activity equivalent to that of human sPLA2-IIA, thus ruling out nonspecific inhibition by peptide binding to substrate. The inhibition properties of all the peptides screened are shown in TableI. No linear peptide showed significantly greater inhibition than the control peptide. Alanine substitution of Phe, Leu, Ser, and Tyr completely abrogated inhibition. The analogue FLSYA was insoluble in enzyme reaction buffer and consequently was not tested. Consistent with previous data obtained using an alternative mixed micelle assay of enzyme activity (30Tseng A. Inglis A.S. Scott K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23992-23998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), any alteration in the length of the peptide abrogated inhibition. Further, acetylation of the amino terminus together with amidation of the carboxyl terminus of the peptide resulted in loss of inhibition. Altering the location of the side chains relative to the termini also abrogated inhibition whether (l) or (d) isomers of the peptide were used. However, reversing the termini while maintaining the relationship between the side-chain and backbone atoms of the peptide by synthesizing the retro-(d) sequence kyslf resulted in inhibition comparable with the control peptide (TableI).Table IRelative effect of single-site side-chain substitutions in the pentapeptide FLSYK on peptide inhibition of human sPLA2-IIA enzyme activityPeptide sequence modificationFold change in IC501-aData are expressed as fold increase in IC50 of peptide analogue relative to the positive control FLSYK peptide.

Most of all, senescent cells do not respond properly to external stimuli and do not uptake materials as efficiently as presenescent cells. To elucidate the reason for such attenuated response of senescent cells, we attempted to monitor the functional capacity and molecular mechanism for the clathrin-dependent, receptor-mediated endocytosis in the senescent cells, and tried to find principal molecules responsible for the decreased endocytotic activity in senescent cells that might be a target of intervention for the age-related dysfunctions.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1.

We now find that NrdD and NrdG fromLactobacillus lactis anaerobically form a tight α2β2 complex, suggesting that radical generation by NrdG and radical transfer to the specific glycine residue of NrdD occurs within the complex. Activated NrdD was separated from NrdG by anaerobic affinity chromatography on dATP-Sepharose without loss of its glycyl radical. NrdD alone then catalyzed the reduction of CTP with formate as the electron donor and ATP as the allosteric effector. The reaction required Mg2+ and was stimulated by K+ but not by dithiothreitol. Thus NrdD is the actual reductase, and NrdG is an activase, making class III reductases highly similar to pyruvate formate lyase and its activase and suggesting a common root for the two anaerobic enzymes during early evolution.

From this first enzyme, the three classes of ribonucleotide reductases of today have evolved. Enzymes belonging to different classes differ in their sensitivity to molecular oxygen; class I, present in all higher organisms and in many microorganisms, is oxygen-dependent; class III, present in microorganisms with anaerobic metabolism, is poisoned by oxygen; and class II, present in prokaryotes and a few lower eukaryotes, functions both during aerobiosis and anaerobiosis.

The small protein (NrdG) serves to generate the radical with the aid of a 4Fe-4S cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet).1 Both the cluster and the glycyl radical are highly oxygen-sensitive.

NrdG belongs to a family of proteins that generate carbon-centered radicals for the activation of difficult chemical reactions. Radical generation occurs by reductive cleavage of AdoMet by a [4Fe-4S]+ cluster of the protein, resulting in the formation of a deoxyadenosyl radical.

This crucial finding greatly aided studies on the anaerobic reductase that over the years (10Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol.

In the first step, the FeS cluster of NrdG is reduced to the [4Fe-4S]+ state by reduced flavodoxin (22Bianchi V. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Mulliez E. Hoover D.M. Matthews R.G. Reichard P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 197: 792-797Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar), generated in the cell by NADPH and flavodoxin reductase or by deazaflavin plus light in the test tube. AdoMet is bound to the cluster and cleaved reductively into methionine and a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Evidence for this is that one NrdG dimer binds one molecule of AdoMet only after reduction, resulting in a change of the EPR spectrum of the [4Fe-4S]+ cluster (11Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P.

A similar conclusion was reached from different experiments with the lysine mutase (26Magnusson O.T. Reed G.H. Frey P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9764-9765Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Cosper N.J. Booker S.J. Ruzicka F. Frey P.A. Scott R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15668-15673Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In the next step the deoxyadenosyl radical transfers its spin to the specific glycine of the NrdD polypeptide by accepting one electron plus one proton, thereby creating the glycyl radical. The reductive cleavage of AdoMet and the electron transfer that gives rise to the glycyl radical may occur in concert to protect the highly reactive deoxyadenosyl radical. Once the glycyl radical is formed, NrdD is ready to reduce a ribonucleoside triphosphate with formate as electron donor. The participation of formate (23Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Eliasson R. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8759-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) distinguishes class III from class I and II ribonucleotide reductases, where reduced dithiols (protein-redoxins such as thioredoxin or DTT) provide the electrons. NrdD and NrdG of E. coli form a tight α2β2 complex during aerobic sucrose gradient centrifugation (10Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that the active enzyme is a heterotetramer, similar to the aerobic class I reductases. However, it subsequently appeared that in a catalytic assay one NrdG could activate several NrdDs, suggesting that the two proteins could dissociate during catalysis and that NrdG had an activase function (24Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) similar to the activase of PFL (14Kessler D. Knappe J. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1999-2005Google Scholar). In contrast to the two E. coli proteins, NrdG and NrdD ofL. lactis separated easily and did not form an α2β2 complex during sucrose gradient centrifugation (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have now taken advantage of the properties of the L. lactis system to study complex formation and to investigate if activated NrdD alone, after separation from NrdG, was enzymatically active as a ribonucleotide reductase. We found that reduced NrdG and NrdD under anaerobic conditions also form a stoichiometric α2β2 complex. However, oneL. lactis NrdG could introduce glycyl radicals into several NrdDs in the absence of substrate. After separation from NrdG, activated NrdD alone fully supported the reduction of CTP by formate in a reaction that no longer required DTT but was stimulated by potassium ions. L. lactis NrdG and NrdD were prepared from strains of E. coli overproducing these proteins. As earlier, NrdG was purified from E. coli IG017 carrying plasmid pIG022 (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For NrdD we used a new construct. The previously used E. coli IG016 contained the wholenrdDG operon. Now we purified NrdD from a plasmid coding only for nrdD. To this purpose we amplified thenrdD-coding sequence from pUKDD1 (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers; forward LlDup, 5′-ACATATGAAAACAGAAGTA-3′ and reverse LlDlow, 5′-AGGATCCTTCATACTTATTTCTCC-3′. The primers were designed to generate NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, at the start and end of the resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments. The amplified product, 2259 base pairs, was cloned in pGEM-T (Promega), resulting in plasmid pIG066. This plasmid was sequenced in both directions to assure a lack of mutations generated during polymerase chain reaction amplification. After digestion withNdeI and BamHI, the nrdD fragment was ligated into PET22b (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid pIG067 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The resulting strain IG031 was grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and the bacteria were used for aerobic overproduction of NrdD. NrdD was purified aerobically as described earlier (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The stickiness of NrdG presented problems resulting in the appearance of multiple enzymatically active peaks during various chromatographic procedures. We could largely, but not completely, avoid this phenomenon by removing iron from NrdG at an early stage of the purification. To this purpose the ammonium sulfate precipitate (660 mg) obtained by the earlier-described procedure (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) from 12 g of E. coli was dissolved and dialyzed anaerobically overnight against two changes of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithionite followed by further dialysis, first against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 1m NaCl, and subsequently against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT (buffer A). From here on all steps were made in air. After centrifugation, the clear supernatant solution containing 540 mg of protein was diluted to 100 ml with buffer A and passed through a 60-ml column of DE-52 equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted (15-ml fractions) with 200 ml of buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. NrdG was localized by SDS gel electrophoresis in fractions 6–13 (136 mg of protein). This step served to remove nucleic acids as well as some inactive protein. NrdG was precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation and dissolved in a small amount of buffer A (94 mg of protein in 2.6 ml). Two separate portions of the material were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on a preparative Superdex 75 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl. The column was eluted (2.6-ml fractions/2 min) with the same buffer. Fractions were analyzed for protein and by SDS gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 3). Fractions were combined and precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate to 80% saturation. After centrifugation, the sediment was dissolved in a small volume of buffer A and equilibrated with buffer A on a Sephadex G-25 26/60 column, giving a total of 40 mg of homogeneous NrdG from two chromatograms. The material was stored frozen in portions at −80 °C for later reactivation with iron and sulfide. Reactivation was made under anaerobic conditions starting from 1–2 mg of NrdG and a slight excess of 59Fe and sulfide as described earlier (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The less hygroscopic Li2S was used in place of Na2S. After the final overnight dialysis in the anaerobic hood, the material was stored inside the hood at +4 °C and used for further experiments, usually within a few days. When stored in the hood, NrdG retained full activity in the CTP reduction assay for several weeks. On an anaerobic manifold 2.1 mg of NrdD was flushed at room temperature for 2 h with argon in the presence of 1 mm AdoMet, 0.3 mm deazaflavin, 15 mm MgCl2, 120 mm KCl, 120 mm sodium formate, 10 mm DTT, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 0.26 ml. After transfer of the solution to the anaerobic hood (+4 °C) 0.27 mg of NrdG in 0.33 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added, and the solution was irradiated with visible light for 60 min. A portion of the solution was transferred to an EPR tube for quantitation of the glycyl radical. To the remainder, 0.185 ml of 2 m KCl was added, and the solution adsorbed to a l-ml column of dATP-Sepharose equilibrated with 30 mm Tris, 0.5 m KCl. The column was washed first with 4 ml of Tris/KCl followed by 4 ml of 30 mm Tris-HCl. NrdD was then eluted (fractions of 3 drops) with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mmATP. All fractions were analyzed for protein and 59Fe. A total of 0.4 mg of NrdD was eluted in fractions 3–6 (0.57 ml). A portion was set aside for EPR spectroscopy, and the rest was used for enzyme experiments. The NrdD fraction contained 2 μg of NrdG, as calculated from the content of 59Fe and assuming that all iron was present as NrdG. The bulk of NrdG was in the wash fractions. The low salt wash also contained a considerable amount of NrdD. A 6-ml column of Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was made anaerobic in the anaerobic hood at +4 °C by washing with 10 mm DTT, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dATP, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. On the anaerobic manifold 1.4 mg of NrdD was purged with argon together with 4 mm AdoMet, 0.13 mm deazaflavin, 20 mm MgCl2, 130 mm sodium formate, 130 mm KCl, 20 mm DTT, 0.3 mm dATP, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 0.175 ml. After transfer to the anaerobic hood, 0.5 mg of 59Fe-NrdG in 0.065 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added, and the solution was irradiated with visible light for 60 min and finally chromatographed on the Superdex 200 column. The first 2 ml were discarded. Fractions (0.2 ml) were then collected and analyzed for protein and 59Fe content. In control experiments, 59Fe-NrdG (0.5 mg) or NrdD (1.0 mg) were chromatographed separately under identical conditions on the same column. The column had been standardized with aldolase and bovine serum albumin. NrdG and NrdD in fractions from the complex peak of the Superdex 200 chromatogram were separated by denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis, and the amount of NrdG present was quantitated by planimetry after staining with Coomassie Blue. To obtain a standard curve we separated various amounts of NrdG from an excess of NrdD, mimicking the expected conditions in the chromatographic fractions using 5 μg of NrdD and between 0.5 and 2.2 μg of NrdG. A plot of the area of the NrdG peak against the amount of NrdG present in the gel (Fig. 2) showed reasonable proportionality. In various runs the absolute values varied as much as 20%. We therefore always included standards in each experimental run. To obtain good results for NrdG, it was necessary to overload the gel with respect to NrdD. We could therefore not determine NrdD directly but obtained the NrdD value by subtraction of NrdG from the total protein added to the gel. Ribonucleotide reduction was routinely measured as the anaerobic reduction of CTP to dCTP (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol.

A. 1989; 86: 2147-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a two-step procedure carried out in the same tube, NrdD was first activated with AdoMet, deazaflavin, and light by NrdG followed in a second step by the addition of CTP and the components required for its reduction. Experiments in which activated NrdD had been separated from NrdG were limited to the second step. One unit is defined as 1 nmol of dCTP formed/min. Specific activity is units/mg of either NrdD or NrdG, assayed with an excess of the other protein. Protein was determined according to Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar), with crystalline bovine serum albumin as standard. Iron analyses were as described by Fish (29Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), and labile sulfide was determined by a scaled down procedure described by King and Morris (30King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 110: 634-641Google Scholar). EPR analyses of the glycyl radical and its quantitation were made as described earlier (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,13Liu A. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12367-12373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein was prepared from an E. coli strain IG031, overproducing NrdD but not NrdG. Purification could therefore be done aerobically. The final preparation showed a single homogeneous band at 80 kDa on SDS electrophoresis (not shown). During chromatography on Superdex 200 the protein migrated as a dimer (see below). As isolated, NrdD completely lacked ribonucleotide reductase activity. After activation by NrdG, the protein contained maximally one glycyl radical/dimer (see below) and then had a specific ribonucleotide reductase activity of 800–1000 (nmol dCTP min−1 · mg−1). In the final purification step on Superdex 75 described under “Materials and Methods” a large symmetrical protein peak was found in the position expected from a NrdG monomer (Fig. 3). The protein in these fractions gave a single homogeneous band at 25 kDa (NrdG polypeptide = 23 kDa) by SDS gel electrophoresis. At this stage, NrdG contained only traces of iron and inorganic sulfide and was enzymatically inactive. In earlier work we found that anaerobic treatment of largely inactive preparations of L. lactis (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or E. coli (11Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T.

After reduction with either dithionite or deazaflavin plus light EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a reduced [4Fe-4S]+cluster in NrdG. Anaerobic treatment of NrdG from the monomer peak of Fig. 3 with 59Fe and sulfide gave a protein containing, per polypeptide, 2.6 molecules of sulfide and 4.9 molecules of iron (by colorimetry) and 4.8 molecules of 59Fe (from radioactivity). The identity of the two values for iron shows that the iron content in further experiments could be reliably determined from radioactivity. This 59Fe-NrdG was rechromatographed anaerobically on a column of Superdex 75 to relate enzyme activity to iron and sulfide content and state of polymerization (Fig.4). Two protein peaks separated, one sharp, relatively homogeneous peak in the NrdG-monomer position and a broader peak with NrdG aggregates. Measurements of radioactivity and sulfide showed that the peak fractions of the NrdG monomer contained an average of 2.3 molecules of Fe and 2.7 molecules of sulfide per polypeptide chain. The faster-moving large aggregates had higher iron/protein ratios, with a value of six in the peak fraction. All fractions showed activity in the NrdD activation assay. However, the monomer peak had an almost 5-fold higher specific activity (15.800 nmol of dCTP min−·mg−1) than the protein of the leading peak containing higher aggregates. Note that the chromatogram in Fig. 4 resulted from a NrdG protein that before activation was a homogeneous monomer and that all protein fractions of Fig. 4 gave a single band close to 23 kDa on denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis. The heterogeneity was introduced during the activation process and appears to be related to variability in the iron content. In earlier work (9Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) we tried without success to isolate by aerobic sucrose gradient centrifugation a complex between NrdD and NrdG. This was in contrast to the corresponding situation for E. coli where such a complex was readily formed in the presence of dATP (10Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We investigated now the possibility that complex formation of the two L. lactisproteins requires anaerobiosis in experiments involving chromatography on Superdex 200 in the anaerobic box. This method readily separated the small NrdG protein from NrdD and from a hypothetical NrdG·NrdD complex. A shift of 59Fe-NrdG from the monomer position to the front of the chromatogram would indicate complex formation and also permit determination of the stoichiometry between NrdG and NrdD. An experiment of this kind is shown in Fig.5. All runs were made under identical conditions on the same column that first had been standardized with proteins of known molecular mass. Fig.5, panel A shows that NrdD in the presence of dATP migrated as a homogeneous peak to a position one fraction ahead of aldolase (165 kDa), suggesting that it is a dimer of 2 × 83 kDa. Fig. 5, panel B shows the result with reactivated NrdG. The main peak is in fractions 13–16, in the monomer position but with a leading shoulder all the way to fraction 6. The molar iron/protein ratio of the monomer is 2.1. The ratio increases greatly toward the front of the chromatogram, in general agreement with the results on Superdex 75 (Fig. 4), even though on Superdex 200 the monomer is less well separated from the higher aggregates. A small amount of radioactivity was found in the inner volume, suggesting some dissociation of 59Fe from the protein (not shown). Whe"

Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 471-486Google Scholar). All ETFs are heterodimeric, and all possess one equivalent of noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), with the exception of ETF from Megasphaera elsdenii, which contains two equivalents of noncovalently bound FAD (8Whitfield C.D. Mayhew S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2801-2810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ETFs from human, pig, Paracoccus denitrificans, andMethylophilus methylotrophus also contain one equivalent of AMP per dimer; this AMP facilitates reconstitution of the holo-ETF from the guanidine-denatured protein (9Griffin K.J.

Williams Jr., C.H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University of Calgary Press, Calgary, Canada1996: 515-518Google Scholar). Human and P. denitrificans ETFs share 54% sequence identity and belong to the category of housekeeping ETFs (11Weidenhaupt M. Rossi P. Beck C. Fischer H.M. Hennecke H. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 169-178PubMed Google Scholar), oxidizing fatty acids and some amino acids. The catalytic and redox properties of the two proteins are very similar (12Husain M. Steenkamp D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 709-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Watmough N.J. Kiss J. Frerman F.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystal structures have been determined for both ETFs at resolutions of 2.1 and 2.6 Å, respectively (14Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These reveal that the overall fold for both proteins is identical with the exception of a single loop region. The two subunits comprise three domains, domain I (the N-terminal region of the α-subunit), domain II (the C-terminal region of the α-subunit and a small C-terminal region of the β-subunit), and domain III (the majority of the β-subunit). Both proteins have a Y-shaped structure, with domains I and III forming a shallow bowl in which domain II rests. The FAD cofactor lies in a cleft between domains II and III, with most of the FAD molecule interacting with domain II. Human ETF is the electron acceptor for nine physiological partners (16Ikeda Y. Tanaka K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9477-9487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been modeled previously in complex with one of these partners, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), by docking the crystal structures of the two proteins as rigid bodies (14Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this model complex, the distance between the redox centers of the proteins (FAD in ETF to FAD in MCAD) was 19.5 Å, and it was suggested that this could be reduced by 3–4 Å if changes in the conformation of one or both of the proteins were to occur on complex formation (14Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, this is still larger than the expected maximum distance for electron transfer of ∼14 Å on the basis of the principle of “robust engineering” (17Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The dynamics of Methylophilus methylotrophus (sp. W3A1) ETF have been studied previously by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) (18Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This study revealed that domain II does not have a well defined position relative to domains I and III but samples a range of conformations corresponding to rotation relative to domains I and III. W3A1 ETF is a highly specific electron carrier that accepts electrons from only one enzyme, trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH) (19Steenkamp D.J. Gallup M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4086-4089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ETF shares 31 and 33% sequence identity with human and P. denitrificans ETFs, respectively. Binding of W3A1 ETF to its physiological redox partner, TMADH, is thought to involve the formation of a number of distinct metastable states (20Basran J. Chohan K.K. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9188-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) rather than a single eT complex with unique configuration. In the TMADH/W3A1 ETF system, the intrinsic rate of eT is much faster than the experimentally observed rate, and it is thought that binding and/or reorganization of ETF on the surface of TMADH is rate-limiting (20Basran J. Chohan K.K. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9188-9200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we describe the use of SAXS to examine the structural properties of human and P. denitrificans ETFs in solution. We demonstrate that for both of these ETFs the SAXS data are inconsistent with a static conformation of free ETF and hence that these molecules are conformationally dynamic in free solution. We also use protein modeling and docking studies to produce models of the complex of human ETF and one of its physiological redox partners, MCAD, which incorporates the conformational flexibility of human ETF. The models indicate the dynamics of ETF can lead to an ∼100,000-fold increase in the intrinsic rate of interprotein electron transfer and thus reveal the potential importance of protein dynamics in optimizing electronic coupling between redox centers. Human and P. denitrificans ETFs were expressed and purified as described previously (Refs. 21Salazar D. Zhang L. deGala G.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26425-26433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and 13Watmough N.J. Kiss J. Frerman F.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, respectively). Oxidized human and P. denitrificans ETFs were used in scattering experiments after gel filtration and dilution (for concentration-dependent scattering experiments). Both proteins were prepared in the AMP-bound form; the semiquinone form of either protein was not used because this is unstable in air and therefore inaccessible to SAXS studies. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded before and after x-ray exposure for samples to ensure that no x-ray-dependent redox change occurred. This also allowed the concentration of ETF samples to be determined using the absorption at 438 nm (human ETF, ε436 = 13,300m−1 cm−1 (21Salazar D. Zhang L. deGala G.D. Frerman F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26425-26433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); P. denitrificans ETF, ε436 = 13,600m−1 cm−1 (13Watmough N.J. Kiss J. Frerman F.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); W3A1 ETF, ε438 = 11,300m−1 cm−1 (18Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). The scattering from W3A1 ETF in its reduced (anionic semiquinone; this is more stable than the oxidized form and gives identical scattering (18Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) form was extended compared with our previous study (18Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and allowed a straightforward comparison with the other ETFs. SAXS experiments were performed with protein concentrations between 0.3 and 19 mg/ml. X-ray solution scattering data were collected in two sessions with the low-angle scattering camera on station 2.1 (22Towns-Andrews E. Berry A. Bordas J. Mant P.K. Murray K. Roberts K. Sumner I., J.S., W. Lewis R. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2346-2349Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at the Synchotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK) using a position-sensitive multiwire proportional counter (23Lewis R.R. J. Synchrotron. Radiat. 1994; 1: 43-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the sample-to-detector distance of 2.25 m (1.25 m) and the x-ray wavelength of λ = 1.54 Å, a momentum transfer interval of 0.002 Å−1 ≤ s ≤ 0.050 Å−1 (0.005 Å−1 ≤ s ≤ 0.088 Å−1) was covered. The modulus of the momentum transfer is defined as s = 2 sin Θ/λ, where 2Θ is the scattering angle. The s-range was calibrated using an oriented specimen of wet rat tail collagen (based on a diffraction spacing of 670 Å). The samples were contained in a brass cell holding a Teflon ring sandwiched by two mica windows that define the sample volume of 120 μl and a thickness of 1.5 mm. The brass cell was maintained at 4 °C during data acquisition. The buffer and sample were measured in alteration, each in frames of 60 s (amounting to a total measuring time between 5 and 45 min depending on sample concentration and changes monitored on-line during experiments). Reduction and analysis of scattering data was performed as described previously (24Grossmann J.G. Crawley J.B. Strange R.W. Patel K.J. Murphy L.M. Neu M. Evans R.W. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The radius of gyration Rg , forward scattering intensity Io, and the intraparticle distance distribution function p(r) were calculated from the experimental scattering data using the indirect Fourier transform method as implemented in the program GNOM (25Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Relative Io/c values (c = sample concentration) give the relative molecular weight of the protein samples when referenced against a suitable standard (bovine serum albumin was used with a known molecular mass of 66 kDa). The maximum molecular dimension Dmax of the particle can be evaluated because of the characteristic ofp(r). The volume V of the particle can be calculated from the Porod invariant (26Porod G. Kolloid Z. Z. Polym. 1951; 124: 83-114Crossref Scopus (1524) Google Scholar) and a correction factor taking into account the limited experimental scattering range (27Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-Angle X-Ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987Crossref Google Scholar). The multipole expansion method proposed by Stuhrmann (28Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. 1970; A26: 297-306Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and developed by Svergun et al. (29Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Barberatop C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar) was used to obtain the molecular shape of human ETF. The smoothed scattering profile of reduced human ETF was fitted ab initio by the scattering from an envelope function starting from an ellipsoidal initial approximation (consistent with the experimental Rg andDmax values). The molecular shape was characterized with spherical harmonics using 19 free parameters (fourth-order harmonics), which is acceptable given the minor differences compared with the shape obtained for third-order harmonics (10 free parameters) and considering the information content in the data used. The x-ray scattering curve at higher angles (starting approximately from s = 0.04 Å−1) contains significant contributions from the internal molecular structure. Consequently, there are deviations between the experimental profile and the curve resulting from the shape fit for higher scattering angles (see Fig. 1). Only models based on crystallographic information (i.e. that take into account the molecular inhomogeneities) allow exploitation of the full experimental data range. Scattering data simulations were carried out using the x-ray structures of human (14Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and P. denitrificans (15Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) ETFs in their crystal conformations and with domain II rotated by 25 and 50 ° with respect to domains I and III. Parameters and scattering curves were computed from the model coordinates using the program CRYSOL (30Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2688) Google Scholar), which also considers the hydration shell of the solvated protein. The crystal structure of human ETF (Ref. 14Roberts D.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12412-12420Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; PDB accession code1egd) (crystal structures of only the oxidized forms of human ETF and human MCAD are available) using the protein-protein docking program GRAMM (33Vakser I.A. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 455-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ten complexes were produced and analyzed using InsightII (InsightII, MSI, San Diego, CA) to select the most appropriate docking. Our criteria for selecting the most reasonable docking were that the ETF did not overlap with the acyl-CoA binding site on MCAD and the calculated eT rate (Table I) was a maximum. To produce potential “eT active” conformations of ETF, the flexible linkers between domains I and II (residues α205–α208) and domains II and III (β229–β233) were aligned along the z axis using InsightII. Domain II (residues α209–α331 and β234–β255) was rotated by 10 ° toward domain I. Domains I (residues α20–α204) and III (residues β4–β228) were kept rigid. This conformation of human ETF was then docked into MCAD as before. The procedure was repeated for 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 ° of rotation of domain II with respect to domains I and III.Table ICalculated intrinsic electron transfer rates and the surface area of interaction between human ETF and MCADRotation of domain 2 (of ETF)Edge-to-edge distance1-aThe edge-to-edge distance is the “shortest” distance between the FAD in MCAD and the FAD in human ETF (calculated by ET_RATES)./ÅPacking density1-bThe packing density, ρ, is the fraction of the volume between redox centers that is within the united atom van der Waals radius of intervening atoms.

A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab eT from MCAD to ETF involves two sequential one-electron steps (34Beinart H. Enzymes (Basel). 1963; 7: 447-466Google Scholar, 35Thorpe C. Matthews R.G. Williams Jr., C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). One molecule of ETF is reduced from the oxidized to semiquinone form by MCAD, which in turn is oxidized from the hydroquinone to semiquinone form. Subsequently a second molecule of ETF is reduced from the oxidized to semiquinone form by MCAD, which in turn is oxidized from the semiquinone to oxidized form. The intrinsic eT rates between the isoalloxazine ring of MCAD (semiquinone and hydroquinone) and the isoalloxazine ring of the ETF (oxidized) were calculated using the program ET_RATES (17Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). This uses an empirical expression for exergonic electron tunneling, log10⁡keeT=13.0−(1.2−0.8ρ)(R−3.6)−3.1(ΔG+λ)2/λEquation 1 where ρ is the fraction of the volume between redox cofactors that is within the united van der Waals radius of intervening atoms. Assuming that there is only a small change in redox potential of the individual flavins on formation of the ETF·MCAD complex, ΔG for electron transfer from hydroquinone MCAD to oxidized ETF (−0.12 eV) and from semiquinone MCAD to oxidized ETF (−0.16 eV) was calculated from the known potentials of the semiquinone/hydroquinone (−94 mV) and oxidized/semiquinone (−134 mV) couples of MCAD (at pH = 7.1 (36Johnson B.D. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10779-10785Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) and the potential of the oxidized/semiquinone couple (+22 mV) of human ETF (37Dwyer T. Zhang L. Muller M. Marrugo F. Frerman F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reorganization energy, λ, was set to 0.7 eV. The surface area of interaction in the MCAD·human ETF complex was calculated using the program NACCESS (38Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College London, London1993Google Scholar). The experimental solution scattering curves and intraparticle distance distributions for human,P. denitrificans, and W3A1 ETFs are shown in Fig. 1. These demonstrate the very close similarity between the scattering profiles for the three different forms of ETF in the low (s ≤ 0.01 Å−1) and intermediate (0.017 Å−1 ≤ s ≤ 0.025 Å−1) scattering angle regions. SAXS profiles for all three forms of ETF lack the apparent shoulder in the intermediate angle range (i.e. between 0.025 Å−1 < s < 0.04 Å−1) that can be associated with the static lobed domain structure when compared with scattering pattern simulations of the crystalline state (see also figure 3 in Ref. 18Jones M.

Furthermore, the fact that the experimental SAXS profiles for both human and P. denitrificans ETFs are almost superimposable on the experimental SAXS profile for W3A1 ETF in the intermediate angle range suggests, given that the three forms of ETF are of very similar size, that all three proteins possess a similar domain arrangement in solution and sample a range of conformations corresponding to a rotation of domain II relative to domains I and III (18Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The calculated Rg values for human andP. denitrificans ETFs are independent of the concentration of the ETF sample under analysis, indicating that these proteins are not subject to the concentration-dependent aggregation effects that were observed during the analysis of W3A1 ETF (18Jones M. Basran J. Sutcliffe M.J. Grossmann J.G. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21349-21354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Rg values obtained for human and P. denitrificans ETFs are essentially identical, 25.6 ± 0.3 and 25.4 ± 0.3 Å, respectively, and slightly smaller than that of W3A1 ETF (26.4 ± 0.3 Å from the present study). Their close structural relationship is emphasized by the similar values for maximum molecular dimension (80 ± 4 Å) and volume (110,000 Å3 for W3A1, 108,000 Å3 for human, and 106,000 Å3 for P. denitrificans ETFs, the error in volume is of the order of 5%) for the three ETFs. The slightly larger apparent size of W3A1 ETF is most likely to arise from a greater degree of flexibility between domain II and the “base” formed by domains I and III. This is likely the result of more flexibility in the two regions of the polypeptide chain linking these two parts of the structure: (i) the intrinsically flexible domain I-domain II linker in W3A1 (amino acid sequenceα193GGG α195, compare withα205TKS α207 and α183AESα185 in human and P. denitrificans ETFs, respectively) and (ii) the much longer loop section in the C-terminal part of the β-subunit of W3A1 (residues β228–β245, compare with β229–β236 and β226–β233 in human and P. denitrificans ETFs, respectively). Additionally, differences in domain-domain interactions will certainly be present because of the 31 and 33% sequence identities between W3A1 and human and P. denitrificansETFs, respectively. Analysis of the low angle scattering range (s ≤ 0.01 Å−1) confirmed that human and P. denitrificans ETFs also behave as heterodimers with molecular masses of ∼60 kDa each without forming higher oligomers. In this context, it is interesting to note that unlike human and P. denitrificans ETFs, W3A1 ETF exhibits a broad peak in the very low angle range (corresponding to a spacing of about 250 Å) at concentrations higher than 15 mg/ml (data not shown). This indicates that the scattering data is already affected by the protein distribution in the solution (i.e. the so-called solution structure factor) and implies that W3A1 ETF interactions at these protein concentrations are dominated by a repulsive force, a feature that may notably influence the crystallization behavior of this protein. Thep(r) function for both human and P. denitrificans ETFs (see Fig. 1, inset) possesses a characteristic shoulder at 36 Å, which (as with W3A1 ETF) indicates that both proteins have a diffuse Y-shaped conformation with distinct domain features as opposed to a compact globular structure. The latter would possess a pair distribution function without distinctive features, for instance thep(r) function of the compact iron-bound conformation of transferrin (24Grossmann J.G. Crawley J.B. Strange R.W. Patel K.J. Murphy L.M. Neu M. Evans R.W. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Small differences in thep(r) function at higher intraparticle distances (between 50 and 70 Å) reflect the above-mentioned increased flexibility of W3A1 ETF compared with the other two ETFs. The x-ray structures of human and P. denitrificans ETFs have been solved previously (14Roberts D.L. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14355-14360Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Roberts D.L. Salazar D. Fulmer J.P. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1977-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Using these atomic coordinates, simulated x-ray scattering profiles were generated for solvated structures of both human andP. denitrificans ETFs and fitted against the experimental data for each protein, respectively (Fig.2). The experimental scattering profile for human ETF does not correspond adequately to the simulated profile generated from the crystal structure of human ETF. Significant differences in the scattering interval 0.025 Å−1 ≤ s ≤ 0.045 Å−1 result in a fit with χ2= 3.31. Similarly, the experimental scattering profile for P. denitrificans ETF does not correspond adequately to the simulated profile generated from the crystal structure of P. denitrificans ETF (χ2 = 2.90). Consequently, it is clear that in both cases the crystallographic model does not satisfactorily describe the molecular structure in solution. It was hypothesized that human and P. denitrificans ETFs in solution may possess a static conformation that differs substantially from that suggested by their respective crystal structures. Both human and P. denitrificans ETFs possess two polypeptide loop regions, between domains I and II and domains II and III, which may, as suggested for W3A1 ETF (39Chohan K.K. Scrutton N.S. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Peptide Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar) (see above), act as a flexible “hinge” to allow the rotation by up to ∼50 ° of domain II with respect to domains I and III. Therefore, molecular models were produced of human and P. denitrificans ETFs in which domain II was rotated about this hinge with respect to domains I and III, treating these two domains as a rigid body. Because these ETFs possess a pseudo 2-fold axis of symmetry about the interface of domains I and III, a conformational model of ETF in which domain II is rotated in the direction of domain I generates an essentially identical simulated SAXS profile to that generated from a model in which domain II is rotated in the direction of domain III. Hence, four conformational models were designed: human ETF with domain II rotated by 25 ° in the direction of domain I, human ETF with domain II rotated by 50 ° in the direction of domain I, P. denitrificans ETF with domain II rotated by 25 ° in the direction of domain I, and P. denitrificans ETF with domain II rotated by 50 ° in the direction of domain I. Simulated SAXS profiles were generated for all these molecular models of ETF; the experimental scattering profile for human ETF does not correspond well to any of the simulated profiles generated from the conformational models of human ETF even though the fits improve significantly compared with the crystallographic model. For SAXS simulations generated from models of human ETF in which domain II was rotated by 25 or 50 °, respectively, χ2 values of 2.32 and 2.00 were obtained for fits to the experimental data. Similarly, the simulated scattering profiles generated from the conformational models of P. denitrificans ETF do not entirely match the experimental profiles generated from the conformational models of P. denitrificansETF. For SAXS simulations generated from models of P. denitrificans ETF in which domain II was rotated by 25 or 50 ° (a larger number of rotations were not generated because no single conformation will fit the molecular envelope; see below), respectively, χ2 values of 2.31 and 2.32 were obtained for fits to the experimental data. The fact that none of the simulated SAXS profiles for these structures/models can be unambiguously fitted to the experimental SAXS data suggests that neither the structure of human ETF nor the P. denitrificans ETF can be represented by a static conformational model, as illustrated by their molecular envelope structures (Fig. 3). This substantiates the conclusion that both proteins sample a range of different conformations in solution. We note that because of the assumption of a uniform density inside the molecular envelope, the presented shape gives only an average static picture of this flexible protein in solution.Figure 3Three orientations of the calculated molecular envelope structure for human ETF superimposed over its crystal structure. Because the scattering results for human andP. denitrificans ETFs are virtually identical, the restored shape of human ETF also represents the molecular envelope of P. denitrificans ETF. The shape displays the excellent fit between the globular base of the envelope structure and domains I and III but highlights the conformational flexibility of domain II. Because this envelope represents an average conformation, it appears that domain II occupies more frequently the space toward one side of the base (here toward domain I), a finding underlined by the scattering pattern simulations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nevertheless, because of the size of domain II, its conformation will influence the overall shape of the molecule significantly. This can be seen in the form of a spread out space for this domain sitting above domains I and III. The latter are more tightly connected to each other, and changes in their conformational position are therefore less likely. In contrast, small sections of the polypeptide such as loop regions (e.g. of domain III; Fig. 3) are much more flexible compared with the compact domain core and can therefore appear outside of the shape envelope. We suggested previously that rotation in the W3A1 ETF of domain II by ∼50 ° (with respect to its position relative to domains I and III in the crystal structure of human ETF) was required for eT from its redox partner TMADH (18Jones M.

Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Peptide Lett. 1998; 5: 231-236Google Scholar). The SAXS data presented above suggests that such large conformational changes could also occur in human ETF upon complex formation with MCAD. To test this hypothesis, we have assumed that the conformation of MCAD remains essentially unchanged during complex formation (our future SAXS studies will investigate the validity of this assumption further). This enabled us to model the MCAD·human ETF complex (Fig. 4) and calculate the intrinsic eT rates (TableI). The method we have adopted for calculating eT rates (17Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) considers the density of the protein packing between redox centers without regard to specific “pathways.” An alternative approach (e.g. see Refs. 40Beratan D.N. Betts J.N. Onuchic J.N. Science. 1991; 252: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar and 41Regan J.J. Pathways II. Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA1993Google Scholar) regards eT as occurring via well defined pathways (e.g. via specific bonds and through space jumps). We have used this pathways approach in other studies to identify key amino acids involved in eT (e.g. see Ref. 42Wilson E.K. Huang L. Sutcliffe M.J. Mathews F.S. Hille R. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but we feel that experimental evidence favors an approach that utilizes the protein-packing density. Nevertheless, the pathways approach could have proved useful for identifying such residues in the current study if only a single binding mode (and therefore only a single eT pathway) was likely. However, this is not the case because our results (see below) suggest that efficient eT can occur when domain II is rotated by anywhere between ∼30 and 50 ° toward domain I, resulting in a large number of potential eT pathways (and therefore a large number of different residues likely to be involved in different eT “routes”) because of the large number of different binding modes. Our calculations suggest that domain II has to be rotated by ∼50 ° toward domain I to maximize electronic coupling between the two redox centers. For a robust eT system, the distance between the redox centers should be less than ∼14 Å (17Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). Therefore, a robust and productive eT complex will likely be formed when domain II of human ETF is rotated by between ∼30 and ∼60 ° (Table I) toward domain I. However, a rotation of ∼60 ° can be ruled out because this results in severe steric overlap between domains I and II, suggesting that rotations of between ∼30 and ∼50 ° are required for a productive eT complex. Implicit in the above discussion is the concept of a two-step “collision plus eT transfer” process. However, it is likely that eT occurs not from a single bound conformation of ETF but from an “ensemble” of thermodynamically metastable complexes (i.e. this comprises both a range of conformations of ETFand a range of orientations of each conformation in the eT complex). Within the ensemble of MCAD·ETF structures, a range of intrinsic eT rates (e.g. see Table I) will be present, most of which will likely be much faster than the observed rates of eT in stopped-flow experiments. By utilizing an ensemble of structures in which the intrinsic eT rate far exceeds the observed rate, the system does not rely on adopting a unique geometry for the productive eT complex and all the conformational sampling and thermodynamic restrictions that this imposes. Most experimentally observed and physiological interprotein eT rates are in the range of 102–103 s−1, i.e. much slower than the values calculated when domain II is rotated by between ∼30 and 50 ° with respect to domains I and III (Table I). In this limit where the intrinsic rate of eT is much greater than the observed rate, given the efficient coupling between redox centers, the observed eT rate can be maintained from a number of different eT complex geometries. This is yet another example of a robust engineering principle and builds on the idea that naturally occurring mutations can be accommodated in a redox protein without affecting significantly the eT rate (17Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X.X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The small angle x-ray scattering studies are consistent with the finding that human and P. denitrificansETFs sample a large range of conformations in solution. This is supported by modeling studies that illustrate that a significant change in conformation of ETF (domain II rotating by between ∼30 and 50 ° toward domain I from its position in the respective crystal structures) creates a new regime in which the intrinsic eT rate is elevated well above typical values observed in physiological eT complexes (102–103 s−1). This regime introduces a new robust engineering principle, relaxing the specificity required between MCAD and ETF without compromising the observed eT rates."

Homologous recombination involves a series of enzymatic reactions carried out by large multiprotein complexes. One intermediate of homologous recombination is a four-stranded DNA structure called a Holliday junction (1Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). In bacteria, Holliday junctions are processed at a late stage of recombination into two recombinant duplex DNA molecules by a protein complex that includes RuvA, RuvB, and RuvC (2Shinagawa H.

Electron microscopic studies have demonstrated that RuvB forms a hexameric ring that encircles duplex DNA (4Stasiak A. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Benson C.J., Yu, X. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This structure suggests that homologous (homeologous) DNA duplexes are unwound and rewound during branch migration while they pass through the RuvB rings via RuvA tetramers; this process leads to the formation of heteroduplex DNA.The RuvA tetramer is a junction-specific binding protein that interacts directly with RuvB and loads RuvB onto Holliday junctions. The RuvA monomer consists of three domains: domains I and II are involved in tetramer formation and Holliday junction recognition, respectively (6Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D.

RuvB can be dimeric, hexameric, heptameric, or dodecameric depending on conditions and cofactors such as ATP, Mg2+, and DNA (13Shiba T. Iwasaki H. Nakata A. Shinagawa H. Mol. Gen.

Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The RuvB protein is a member of the AAA+ class of ATPases (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RuvB from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was recently determined (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This protein has a crescent-like architecture consisting of three consecutive domains. The first two domains have a folding pattern that is well conserved in AAA/AAA+ ATPases and is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. However, sequence alignments of AAA+ class proteins show that the amino acid sequence from Leu135 to Leu152 in Escherichia coli RuvB is not conserved in other AAA/AAA+ class proteins such asN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor D2. This implies that this unique region is involved in a specific function of RuvB (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This region forms β-hairpin 1, which protrudes from the first domain of RuvB (Fig. 1) (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).This report describes the properties of two mutant RuvB proteins with mutations in β-hairpin 1, I148T and I150T, which were isolated in a previous study (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The two mutants have a similar phenotype in vivo and are defective in their functional and physical interactions with RuvA protein in vitro. We propose that residues Ile148 and Ile150 in β-hairpin 1 interact with hydrophobic residues in the mobile domain III of RuvA and that this interaction is essential for RuvAB-dependent branch migration.DISCUSSIONThis study examined the properties of RuvB I148T and I150T, which have mutations in β-hairpin 1. DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of the mutant and wild-type RuvB proteins similarly, but RuvA (or RuvA and DNA) stimulated the ATPase activity of the mutants to a much lower extent than it stimulated that of wild-type RuvB (Table I). The RuvB mutants were also deficient in the ability to form a complex with RuvA or a ternary complex with RuvA and a Holliday junction (Figs. 4 and 5). RuvB I148T and I150T bound duplex DNA and formed hexameric rings (Figs.6 and 7) and interacted with RuvC (data not shown) in a manner similar to wild-type RuvB. Thus, the interaction of RuvB I148T and I150T with RuvA, which is required for the elevated ATPase and branch migration activities of the RuvA-RuvB complex, is defective.The data also indicate that RuvB I148T is less severely impaired than RuvB I150T in ternary complex formation, ATP hydrolysis, and branch migration. Complementation analysis also showed that RuvB I148T retained more UV repair activity than RuvB I150T when the proteins were expressed highly in the mutant cells (Fig. 2). These findings further support the idea that the mutants are defective in the interaction with RuvA, and the result of the complementation analysis can be explained by proposing that the decrease in affinity of the mutant proteins can be compensated for by an increase in their concentration.The crystal structure of RuvB from T. thermophilus HB8 was recently determined (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RuvB monomer consists of three domains (I, II, and III) that form a crescent-shaped configuration (Fig.1 B). The RuvB-specific region (L135–L152) forms β-hairpin 1, which is composed of the fourth and fifth β-strands. This β-hairpin protrudes from the AAA+ ATPase motif in domain I (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Leu148 and Leu150 are located in the fifth β-strand (β5). Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that the RuvB hexameric ring includes a large tier and a small tier, and the large tier faces RuvA (4Stasiak A. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Benson C.J., Yu, X. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7618-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 5Yu X. West S.C. Egelman E.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 131: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A tentative model of the hexameric ring based on the crystal structure shows that all six β-hairpin 1 motifs are located on the top of the large tier (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the idea that β-hairpin 1 is involved in the interface between RuvB and RuvA.It is particularly intriguing that ruvA mutations in hydrophobic residues such as Leu167, Leu170, Tyr172, and Leu199 cause a defect in the RuvA-RuvB interaction. These residues are in mobile domain III of RuvA, which interacts specifically with RuvB (7Nishino T. Ariyoshi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Structure. 1998; 6: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Kataoka M. Ariyoshi M. Fujita T. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues are well conserved in these positions involved in this interaction (7Nishino T. Ariyoshi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Structure. 1998; 6: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the protruding β-hairpin 1 in the AAA+ ATPase domain of RuvB may interact with hydrophobic residues in domain III of RuvA.The mobile domain III of RuvA has also been shown not only to interact physically with RuvB but also to modulate RuvB ATPase activity. This suggests that the signal by RuvA for interaction with DNA may be transduced through the NH2 region (domains I + II) to domain III of RuvA, resulting in continuous cycling of RuvB ATP hydrolysis (7Nishino T. Ariyoshi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Structure. 1998; 6: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Kataoka M. Ariyoshi M. Fujita T. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Likewise, such a signal may also be transduced through domain III of RuvA to β-hairpin 1 in domain I of RuvB. β-Hairpin 1 of RuvB is situated between the fourth α-helix and the sixth β-sheet (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the fourth α-helix is involved in intersubunit interaction, which may couple ATP binding or hydrolysis, and that the sixth β-sheet is involved in sensing the ATP hydrolysis status of its own subunit (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Yamada K. Kunishima N.

Therefore, not only is β-hairpin 1 involved in the physical interaction per se with RuvA, but also the interaction with RuvA via β-hairpin 1 may cause a structural change of the ATPase domain of RuvB leading to efficient ATPase cycling. These physical and functional interactions may result in the regulation of RuvB motor activity to drive branch migration of the Holliday junction processively. We propose that β-hairpin 1 interacts with RuvA in a structural and regulatory manner: this interaction may change the structure and activity of the RuvB ATPase domain and drive processive branch migration of Holliday junctions.

Mitchell A.H. West S.C. Cell. 1997; 89: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The RuvB protein is a member of the AAA+ class of ATPases (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W.

The crystal structure of RuvB from Thermus thermophilus HB8 was recently determined (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This protein has a crescent-like architecture consisting of three consecutive domains. The first two domains have a folding pattern that is well conserved in AAA/AAA+ ATPases and is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. However, sequence alignments of AAA+ class proteins show that the amino acid sequence from Leu135 to Leu152 in Escherichia coli RuvB is not conserved in other AAA/AAA+ class proteins such asN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor D2. This implies that this unique region is involved in a specific function of RuvB (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This region forms β-hairpin 1, which protrudes from the first domain of RuvB (Fig. 1) (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This report describes the properties of two mutant RuvB proteins with mutations in β-hairpin 1, I148T and I150T, which were isolated in a previous study (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The two mutants have a similar phenotype in vivo and are defective in their functional and physical interactions with RuvA protein in vitro. We propose that residues Ile148 and Ile150 in β-hairpin 1 interact with hydrophobic residues in the mobile domain III of RuvA and that this interaction is essential for RuvAB-dependent branch migration. DISCUSSIONThis study examined the properties of RuvB I148T and I150T, which have mutations in β-hairpin 1. DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of the mutant and wild-type RuvB proteins similarly, but RuvA (or RuvA and DNA) stimulated the ATPase activity of the mutants to a much lower extent than it stimulated that of wild-type RuvB (Table I). The RuvB mutants were also deficient in the ability to form a complex with RuvA or a ternary complex with RuvA and a Holliday junction (Figs. 4 and 5). RuvB I148T and I150T bound duplex DNA and formed hexameric rings (Figs.6 and 7) and interacted with RuvC (data not shown) in a manner similar to wild-type RuvB. Thus, the interaction of RuvB I148T and I150T with RuvA, which is required for the elevated ATPase and branch migration activities of the RuvA-RuvB complex, is defective.The data also indicate that RuvB I148T is less severely impaired than RuvB I150T in ternary complex formation, ATP hydrolysis, and branch migration. Complementation analysis also showed that RuvB I148T retained more UV repair activity than RuvB I150T when the proteins were expressed highly in the mutant cells (Fig. 2). These findings further support the idea that the mutants are defective in the interaction with RuvA, and the result of the complementation analysis can be explained by proposing that the decrease in affinity of the mutant proteins can be compensated for by an increase in their concentration.The crystal structure of RuvB from T. thermophilus HB8 was recently determined (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The RuvB monomer consists of three domains (I, II, and III) that form a crescent-shaped configuration (Fig.1 B). The RuvB-specific region (L135–L152) forms β-hairpin 1, which is composed of the fourth and fifth β-strands. This β-hairpin protrudes from the AAA+ ATPase motif in domain I (18Yamada K. Kunishima N.

Leu148 and Leu150 are located in the fifth β-strand (β5). Electron microscopic studies demonstrated that the RuvB hexameric ring includes a large tier and a small tier, and the large tier faces RuvA (4Stasiak A. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Benson C.J., Yu, X.

Biol. 2000; 131: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A tentative model of the hexameric ring based on the crystal structure shows that all six β-hairpin 1 motifs are located on the top of the large tier (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the idea that β-hairpin 1 is involved in the interface between RuvB and RuvA.It is particularly intriguing that ruvA mutations in hydrophobic residues such as Leu167, Leu170, Tyr172, and Leu199 cause a defect in the RuvA-RuvB interaction. These residues are in mobile domain III of RuvA, which interacts specifically with RuvB (7Nishino T. Ariyoshi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K.

Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, the protruding β-hairpin 1 in the AAA+ ATPase domain of RuvB may interact with hydrophobic residues in domain III of RuvA.The mobile domain III of RuvA has also been shown not only to interact physically with RuvB but also to modulate RuvB ATPase activity. This suggests that the signal by RuvA for interaction with DNA may be transduced through the NH2 region (domains I + II) to domain III of RuvA, resulting in continuous cycling of RuvB ATP hydrolysis (7Nishino T. Ariyoshi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Structure. 1998; 6: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Kataoka M. Ariyoshi M. Fujita T. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Likewise, such a signal may also be transduced through domain III of RuvA to β-hairpin 1 in domain I of RuvB. β-Hairpin 1 of RuvB is situated between the fourth α-helix and the sixth β-sheet (18Yamada K. Kunishima N. Mayanagi K. Ohnishi T. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the fourth α-helix is involved in intersubunit interaction, which may couple ATP binding or hydrolysis, and that the sixth β-sheet is involved in sensing the ATP hydrolysis status of its own subunit (17Iwasaki H. Han Y.-W. Okamoto T. Ohnishi T. Yoshikawa M. Yamada K. Toh H. Daiyasu H. Ogura T. Shinagawa H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 528-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Yamada K. Kunishima N.

Therefore, not only is β-hairpin 1 involved in the physical interaction per se with RuvA, but also the interaction with RuvA via β-hairpin 1 may cause a structural change of the ATPase domain of RuvB leading to efficient ATPase cycling. These physical and functional interactions may result in the regulation of RuvB motor activity to drive branch migration of the Holliday junction processively. We propose that β-hairpin 1 interacts with RuvA in a structural and regulatory manner: this interaction may change the structure and activity of the RuvB ATPase domain and drive processive branch migration of Holliday junctions. This study examined the properties of RuvB I148T and I150T, which have mutations in β-hairpin 1. DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of the mutant and wild-type RuvB proteins similarly, but RuvA (or RuvA and DNA) stimulated the ATPase activity of the mutants to a much lower extent than it stimulated that of wild-type RuvB (Table I).

The differentiation of HL-60 cells allowed the mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and p44/p42 to be rapidly and transiently activated upon stimulation withN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Western blot analysis using phosphospecific p38 and p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies showed that increasing concentrations of ethanol or 1-butanol but not 2-butanol (0.05–0.5%) inhibited fMLP-induced p38 activation but did not inhibit p44/p42 activation. These data indicated that activation of phospholipase D (PLD) was required for activation of p38 but not p44/p42. We compared the effect of fMLP with those of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We found that ethanol did not inhibit p38 phosphorylation upon stimulation with either GM-CSF or TNFα. These results suggested that in cells stimulated with fMLP, PLD was upstream of p38. To further test the involvement of PLD, we used antisense inhibition of human PLD1 expression. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited p38 but not p44/p42 phosphorylation. These data supported a role for human PLD1 in fMLP-induced p38 activation in neutrophil-like HL-60 cells. In addition, the results obtained with TNFα and GM-CSF demonstrated that p38 activation occurred independently of PLD activation."

We evaluated the effect of different lipids on the protein-protein interactions between MTP and apoB100 or its C-terminally truncated forms. Negatively charged lipids decreased protein-protein interactions between apoB and MTP. In contrast, zwitterionic phospholipids enhanced (2–4-fold) the binding of apoB100 to MTP by increasing affinity (1.5–3-fold) between these proteins without affecting the number of binding sites. Similarly, phospholipids augmented (1.5–4-fold) the binding of various C-terminally truncated apoB peptides to MTP. The increased binding was greater for apoB peptides containing lipid-binding domains, such as apoB28 and apoB42. Surprisingly, preincubation of apoB28 with lipid vesicles had no effect on MTP binding. In contrast, incubation of MTP with lipid vesicles resulted in a stable association of MTP with vesicles, and MTP-lipid vesicles bound better (5-fold increase) to LDL than did lipid-free MTP. To determine whether MTP exists stably associated with lipids in cells, microsomal contents from COS cells expressing MTP, HepG2 cells, and mouse liver were ultracentrifuged, and MTP was visualized in different density fractions. MTP was found associated and unassociated with lipids. In contrast, apoB17 and apoB:270–570 were present unassociated with lipids in COS cells. These studies show that the binding of MTP to lipids results in increased affinity for apoB and that stable MTP-lipid complexes exist in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein-protein interactions between apoB and MTP may juxtapose lipids associated with MTP to lipid-binding domains of apoB and facilitate hydrophobic interactions leading to enhance affinity. We speculate that MTP-lipid complexes may serve as nuclei to form ""primordial lipoproteins"" and may also play a role in the bulk addition of lipids during the ""core expansion"" of these lipoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W2014594620,"We have isolated a novel isoform of phospholipase A2. This enzyme was designated srPLA2because it was discovered while analyzing the proteins interacting with different forms of the v-Src oncoproteins isolated from Rous sarcoma virus-transformed hamster cells. It contains all the functional regions of the PLA2 group IIA proteins but differs at its C-terminal end where there is an additional stretch of 8 amino acids. The SrPLA2 isoform was detected as a 17-kDa precursor in cells and as a mature 14-kDa form secreted in culture medium. A direct interaction of the 17-kDa precursor with the Src protein was observed in lysates of transformed cells. Both the 17- and 14-kDa forms were found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a PLA2 group II protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated. We surmise that srPLA2 interacts with the Src protein at the cell membrane during the process of its maturation. We have isolated a novel isoform of phospholipase A2.

Rous sarcoma virus experimental metastatic activity spontaneous metastatic activity phospholipase A2 prostaglandin E glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid monoclonal antibody Previous work in our laboratories has focused on several transformed hamster cell lines named HET-SR, HET-SR-1, and HET-SR-8. Those lines were isolated as a result of independent infection of primary hamster fibroblasts with different stocks of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV).1 All lines displayed high EMA (experimental metastatic activity) when injected intravenously in adult hamsters, but differed remarkably in SMA (spontaneous metastatic activity) when injected subcutaneously. HET-SR-1 and HET-SR-8 cells were highly metastatic (HM) and HET-SR cells were low metastatic (LM) (1Deichman G.I. Kashleva H.A. Klushareva T.E. Matveeva V.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 908-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Each line has one integrated RSV provirus and express the Src-specific tyrosine kinase (2Brashishkite D.A. Tatosyan A.G.

Those lines secrete prostaglandin E (PgE), which inactivates the cytotoxic activity of NK cells (1Deichman G.I. Kashleva H.A. Klushareva T.E. Matveeva V.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 908-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The production of PgE is in strict correlation withv-src gene expression, with tumor growth, and with the EMA potential of the transformed cells (3Topol L.Z. Kisseljova N.P. Guttierrez M.L. Deichman G.I. Musatkina E.A. Shtutman M.S. Zakamaldina T.Z. Blair D.G. Tatosyan A.G. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Deichman G.I. Kashkina L.M.

Cancer. 1996; 66: 747-752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). src genes from both cell lines were cloned and sequenced. It was found that v-src genes in both HM and LM cells had significant structural changes that were not previously observed in other members of the src family. The most interesting feature was that v-SrcHM and v-SrcLM differed from each other by several amino acids. Cells transformed with retroviral vectors carryingsrcHM and srcLM display differences in morphology and in vivo metastatic activities, and we showed that structural changes in the C-terminal region of the v-Src proteins account for these differences in the metastatic properties of the corresponding transformed cells (5Tatosyan A. Yatsula B. Shtutmam M. Moinova E. Kaverina I. Musatkina E. Leskov K. Mizenina O. Zueva E. Calothy G. Dezelee P. Virology. 1996; 216: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To assess the molecular mechanisms underlying thev-srcHM-dependent high metastatic activity (or lack of such an activity) in v-srcLM-transformed cells, we tried to identify the products of cellular genes associated with the unique C-terminal regions of both v-Src variants, using a two-hybrid approach and a cDNA library made from low metastatic parental hamster fibroblasts. Several proteins interacting with v-Src via its C-terminal fragments were identified that were not characterized previously as v-Src protein partners. We describe here one of these proteins related to the IIA group of phospholipase A2 enzymes, srPLA2(Src-associated phospholipase A2). This protein contains all the conserved functional residues typical for IIA PLA2enzymes and, in addition, 8 amino acids at its C terminus. In vitro, srPLA2 protein interacts with v-SrcHM as well as with v-SrcLM oncoproteins. The 17-kDa precursor version of srPLA2 was identified by co-immunoprecipitation in lysates of RSV-transformed cells in a complex with the v-Src protein; it was found to be phosphorylated on a tyrosine. Spontaneously transformed Syrian hamster fibroblasts and Syrian hamster embryo fibroblasts transformed independently in vitro by different stocks of RSV SR-D (from the Russian Cancer Research Center viral collection) were used (1Deichman G.I. Kashleva H.A. Klushareva T.E. Matveeva V.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 908-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RSV-transformed lines had a typical transformed phenotype, were highly tumorigenic in syngenic hamsters, but differed in their SMA levels: HET-SR cells, low metastatic cell line; HET-SR-1 and HET-SR-8, high metastatic cell lines; HET-SR-2SC, high metastatic line selected from metastatic nodule in vivo. Transfectants HET-SR-N-Ras cl.6 and HET-SR N-Ras cl.34 lines were obtained by supertransfection of HET-SR and HET-SR-2SC, respectively with an activated N-rasgene mutated in the 12th codon (Gly→Asp). Transfection of the cells by the N-ras oncogene was shown to induce the suppression of v-Src activity, coinciding with the decrease of prostaglandin secretion (4Deichman G.I. Kashkina L.M. Mizenina O.A. Gorojanskaya E.G. Nikiforov M.A. Gudkov A.V. Dyakova N.A. Komelkov A.V. Prilutskaya M.O. Kushlinsky N.E. Tatosyan A.G. Int. J.

NIH3T3-c-Src cells expressing the c-src gene were obtained after NIH3T3 cell transfection with a vector containing avianc-src (7David-Pfeuty T. Nouvian-Dooghe Y. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3097-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 mm glutamine in the presence of 5% CO2at 37 °C. mRNA was isolated from Syrian hamster fibroblasts HET-SR cell line using an RNA extraction kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA was synthesized using TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and cloned into a pGAD3S2X vector, a derivative of pGAD-GH with a modified polylinker. The complexity of the library was 1.3 × 106 with 75% of the clones containing an insert (8Mizenina O. Yanushevich Yu. Musatkina E. Rodina A. Camonis J. Tavitian A. Tatosyan A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Several plasmids containing the coding sequence of different parts of v-SrcHM and v-SrcLM, inserted in frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain coding sequence, were constructed in the bait plasmid pVJL11 (a derivative of pBTM116 with a modified polylinker): pLexA-v-SrcHM, pLexA-v-SrcLM, pLexA-v-SrcHMN (corresponding to the N-terminal part of v-SrcHM: amino acids 1–521) and pLexA-v-SrcHMC (C-terminal part of v-SrcHM: amino acids 522–546) and pLexA-v-SrcLMC (C-terminal part of v-SrcLM). The hamster cDNA library was screened as described (8Mizenina O. Yanushevich Yu. Musatkina E. Rodina A. Camonis J. Tavitian A. Tatosyan A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 reporter strain (Mat a his 3D200 trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ade 2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ GAL4) was used. Yeast growth and two-hybrid procedures were handled according to standard protocols (9Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr.

Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Total DNA from His+/LacZ+ colonies was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with custom primers for each cDNA insert. Positive cDNA plasmids were recovered in Escherichia coli strain HB101 as a recipient strain and selected on M9 minimal plates for Leu prototrophy (13Bartel J.V. Chien C-T. Strenglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993: 153-179Google Scholar). To test for target specificity, a mating procedure was used. Strain AMR70 (Mat a, leu2, trp1, his3, ade 2, URA::lexAop-lacZ), transformed with positive clones from the primary screen of the library, was mated with strain L40 transformed with pLexA-v-SrcHMC or pLexA-v-SrcHMN or pLexA-lamin (negative control). The cDNAs from His+/LacZ+ clones were sequenced. cDNA inserts from selected yeast clones were sequenced using custom primers. Sequences were analyzed using the Sequenase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or on an automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., model 373A). Sequences were analyzed in GenBankTM/EBI using the Fasta 3.0t76 search program. Total RNA was extracted from different hamster fibroblast cell lines by the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol method (14Chomczynski P. Succi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar), separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose/formamide gel in 40 mm MOPS, 10 mmsodium acetate, and 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed using α-32P-labeled DNA ofsrPLA2 or v-src as described previously (15Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battley J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier, New York1986Google Scholar). Following autoradiography, blots were stripped by heating them at 90 °C for 2 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.2 mm EDTA and 1.0% SDS and rehybridized for control with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Hamster cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on ice in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 10 mm EDTA; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 0.1 mmNa3VO4; 1 mg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml leupeptin; 1% Nonidet P-40; and clarified by centrifugation. Total protein extracts (100–200 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) according to standard techniques (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), transferred onto nitrocellulose (BA83, Schleicher & Schuell), and immunoblotted with one of the following antibodies: (i) anti-v-c-Src mAb (UBI-184); (ii) anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (Signal Transduction); (iii) srPLA2 antiserum. (1:1000). This antiserum was generated in rabbits (Neosystem) against a synthetic peptide YLMGIKKSCEGESPS corresponding to the C terminus of the srPLA2 (amino acids 131–145), coupled via its N terminus to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Detection was performed with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by the chemiluminescencence detection procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein quantification was performed as described (17Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-peptide serum specificity was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with corresponding peptide used as antigen and by immunoblotting of total cell lysates with srPLA2 antiserum, following immunological exhaustion with the same peptide. The hamster cell lysates (1–2 mg of total protein) were obtained as mentioned above. To accumulate proteins in their tyrosine phosphorylated form (for immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies), the cells were incubated before lysis in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 100 μmNa3VO4. Samples were precleared with normal rabbit antiserum and incubated with either anti-Src polyclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or srPLA2 antiserum or anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 (Signal Transduction Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. They were further incubated with protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Bound complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed five times in lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in 15% or 17% polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted with srPLA2 antiserum or with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20, To detect srPLA2 secretion, 5 ml of culture medium from hamster fibroblasts (1 day of culture, ∼80% of confluence) were clarified by centrifugation and incubated in rotating vials either with srPLA2 antiserum or with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20, or with normal rabbit serum as control, previously bound to protein A-Sepharose beads. After washing in lysis buffer, the material bound to beads was separated in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. The C-terminal fragment of srPLA2cDNA, corresponding to amino acids 50–154 (the fragment obtained as a result of two-hybrid screening of hamster cDNA library) and the full-length srPLA2 including the missing 5′-region of the cDNA (93 nucleotides of mature protein-coding region) were subcloned into pGEX4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST (glutathioneS-transferase) and GST·srPLA2 proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expressed proteins were extracted from bacteria by sonication in modified lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 m KCl) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer's procedure. Purity and integrity of GST fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue R staining of proteins. For in vitro binding studies, 2 mg of protein extracts, obtained as described above, were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B-bound proteins GST·srPLA2 or GST in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1% ovalbumin (18Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Wong T.W. Hanafusa H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Following four washes in lysis buffer and boiling in SDS sample buffer, eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. PLA2 activity was assayed directly in the beads prepared as indicated above. Briefly, the beads were resuspended in the reaction mixture containing 140 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm ATP, and 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5. Lipid kinase assays were initiated by addition of the mixture of 10 μm phosphatidylcholine and 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]phosphatidylcholine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 40 min, then lipids were extracted by a chloroform/methanol mixture (1:1), and subsequently dotted onto silica gel plates. [14C]arachidonic acid was separated from [14C]phosphatidylcholine by thin-layer chromatography in chloroform, methanol, 11% ammonium hydroxide, water (65:35:6:3). The solvent was run up to 2 cm from the top of the plate. Plates were air dried, fixed, and autoradiographed to detect labeled lipids. Lipids were located by autoradiography or visualized with iodine vapor. Band intensities were quantified by scanning several autoradiograms obtained in independent experiments. Autographs scanned in an optical wavelength area using the three-dimensional scanner Extel, and grayscale images were obtained in TIFF files. These images were evaluated using Image Quant and TotalLab programs. This analysis produced quantitative data, in graphic format, for each band of the blot. Integration of each peak represented the relative quantities of material in the corresponding bands. A two-hybrid system was used to search for novel cellular proteins associated with the v-SrcHM and v-SrcLM (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Full-length v-SrcHM and v-SrcLM and their C-terminal parts (v-SrcHMC and v-SrcLMC) were used as “baits” to screen the hamster cDNA library (8Mizenina O. Yanushevich Yu. Musatkina E. Rodina A. Camonis J. Tavitian A. Tatosyan A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The majority of the specific clones contained cDNA-encoding proteins not known as v-Src partners. Here we present detailed analysis of one gene identified as a result of screening with v-SrcHMC. The ability of this clone to interact with two different regions of Src proteins, v-SrcHMN (v-Src without the HMC region), v-SrcHMC and v-SrcLMC was assessed by a two-hybrid test. The specific plasmid was introduced into yeast cells in the presence of pLexA-v-SrcHMN, pLexA-v-SrcHMC, pLex-v-SrcLMC, or pLexA-lamin (negative control), and β-galactosidase activity was assessed by filter and liquid assays (20Transy C. Legrain P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The interaction was found with v-SrcHMC and v-SrcLMC but not with v-SrcHMN (Table I). We concluded, therefore, that the presence of the C-terminal part of Src was essential for its association with this novel protein.Table IYeast two-hybrid analysis of srPLA2 -src interactionBinding domainActivation domainβ-galactosidase activityarbitrary unitspLexA-laminp GAD-srPLA20.000pLexA-Rasp GAD-Raf1.000pLexA-v-srcHMNp GAD0.000pLexA-v-srcHMCp GAD0.000pLexA-v-srcLMCp GAD0.000pLexA-v-srcHMNp GAD-srPLA20.000pLexA-v-srcHMCp GAD-srPLA20.325pLexA-v-srcLMCp GAD-srPLA20.280N- and C-terminal parts of v-SrcHM fusion to LexA and srPLA2fusion to pGAD were co-expressed in yeast strain L40. β-galactosidase activity reflecting proteins interaction was measured by a quantitative β-galactosidase solution assay. Yeast co-transformed with pLexA-lamin and pGAD-srPLA2 were used as negative controls; yeast co-transformed with pLexA-Ras and pGAD-Raf were used as positive controls, and the data were normalized according to this interaction arbitrarily considered as a standard (value 1).

The cloned cDNA was sequenced. A search in the GenBankTM data base revealed a homology with the 3′ parts of different members of the phospholipase A2 group II genes. The missing 5′ section of the gene (150 nucleotides of coding region) was obtained as a result of polymerase chain reaction, using cDNA library and primers corresponding to the pGAD3S2X polylinker (sense) and to the isolated clone (antisense). The presence of full-length srPLA2 RNA in hamster cells was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent analysis of the amplified DNA product. The complete nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of srPLA2 are shown in Fig.1 A. The highest level of homology (about 85%) was observed with the first 394 coding nucleotides of the rat PLA2 gene from the IIA group of phospholipases A2 (21Komada M. Kudo I. Mizushima H. Kitamura N. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The homology observed between these two proteins was less obvious than the homology found at the DNA level (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the srPLA2 protein structure with amino acid sequences of other known members of II group phospholipase A2, including IIA (21Komada M. Kudo I. Mizushima H. Kitamura N. Inoue K. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31195-31202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) confirms that this protein is related to the group IIA enzymes. The protein encoded by the newly identified gene contains essential structural characteristics typical of the PLA2 group II family of proteins: a signal peptide with a potential transmembrane helix (positions 1–21); the PLA2 histidine (63), and aspartic acid (109) in the active enzyme site; the calcium binding loop (45) and all conserved 14 cysteine residues typical for this group of proteins (Fig. 1, A and B). The amino acid differences are located in almost all regions of the protein except in the functional zones situated in the middle of the protein (Fig. 1 B). The main difference between srPLA2and the majority of the other known PLA2 proteins (with the exception of group IIF) is the existence of an additional 8-amino acid fragment at the C-terminal end of the hamster protein (Fig.1 B). This peptide appears as a result of changes in the last exon of srPLA2 encoding DNA in comparison withPLA2 IIA from phylogenetically related rodent cells. In the hamster cDNA, the stop codon present in the rat and mouse PLA2 genes is missing, and the gene is terminated by a TAG codon localized further downstream. These structural changes were identified in all tested Syrian hamster DNAs isolated from different cell lines and animals (data not shown). Despite differences in the structure, our data strongly suggest that this novel srPLA2 is a member of the so-called “secreted” PLA2 gene family and, most probably, belongs to the IIA group of phospholipases A2. To further demonstrate the interaction existing between srPLA2 and v-Src, binding ability was tested in vitro. A fragment of srPLA2 (srPLA2-(50–154)) isolated by two-hybrid screening was expressed as a GST fusion protein and prepared from E. coli. Protein extracts from low metastatic HET-SR and high metastatic HET-SR-8 RSV-transformed cell lines were incubated with purified GST·srPLA2 or GST proteins bound to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and retained proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE; mAbs against c-Src/v-Src were used for immunodetection. Previously, it was found that the proteins of both the HM and LM v-Src isoforms had a molecular mass of 62 kDa. This unusual molecular size (62 kDa instead of 60 kDa) is due to an insertion of 20 additional amino acids in the unique domain of the oncoproteins (5Tatosyan A. Yatsula B. Shtutmam M. Moinova E. Kaverina I. Musatkina E. Leskov K. Mizenina O. Zueva E. Calothy G. Dezelee P. Virology. 1996; 216: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows approximately the same level of v-Src and c-Src proteins in RSV-transformed cells, independent of their metastatic activity (lanes 1 and2). In both cell lines, GST·srPLA2 binds with the v-Src protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and6), whereas GST does not (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). The truncated srPLA2, isolated by two-hybrid screening, lacked the first amino acids that constitute the N-terminal α-helix and the calcium-binding loop, both regions important structurally and functionally. To test the ability of full-length srPLA2 to interact with the Src product, GST-full-length srPLA2fusion protein was used in protein binding assay in vitro. Fig. 2 B shows that the fusion protein carrying full-length srPLA2 protein also effectively binds v-Src protein from transformed cells. The phospholipase activity of bacterially expressed GST·srPLA2 protein was measured. Fig.3 demonstrates that the purified bacterial fusion protein carrying full-length srPLA2stimulates the formation of arachidonic acid after incubation with phosphatidylcholine substrate: i.e. this fusion protein preserves its enzymatic function. According to quantitative evaluation, 1 mg of total bacterial protein contains approximately 20 units of PLA2 activity. In RSV-transformed hamster cells expressing v-Src, no interaction between the c-Src protein and srPLA2 was found (Fig.2 A, lanes 5 and 6). The interaction of the fusion GST·srPLA2 with c-Src proteins from cells not expressing v-Src, was analyzed (Fig. 2 C). NIH3T3 cells overproducing avian c-Src protein and RSV-transformed hamster cells with depressed v-src gene transcription (HET-SR-N-ras cl.34) were compared (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and2). In cell lines overproducing exogenous avian c-Src, a minimal amount of p60c-src was found to be associated with srPLA2 (Fig. 2 C, lane 5). The binding of p60c-src with GST·srPLA2 from HET-SR-N-ras cl.34 cells producing only the c-Src protein was not observed (Fig. 2 C, lane 6). The interaction between GST·srPLA2 and c-Src from spontaneously transformed hamster fibroblasts (STHE) producing high level of Src kinase activity was also observed (data not shown). The protein binding data suggests that both v-Src and c-Src proteins can potentially interact with the srPLA2 protein, but the affinity of the latter is significantly higher for the viral oncoprotein. To detect the srPLA2 protein and its interaction with Src proteins in cells, rabbit anti-srPLA2 serum elicited against a peptide in the C-terminal part of the protein (amino acids 131–145) was prepared. The chosen peptide includes the residues from the amino acid extension at the C terminus and shares less homology with the same region of other known phospholipases (Fig.1 B). This family of enzymes is referred as “secreted PLA2” (26Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R. Pepinsky R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5768-5775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the srPLA2 protein in HET-SR culture medium and in cell lysates. The molecular mass of srPLA2 in cell lysates corresponds to the precursor forms of the PLA2 II group of proteins (about 17 kDa) (Fig.4 A, lane 5). The extracellular protein has a molecular mass of 14 kDa corresponding to the mature form of PLA2 proteins without the N-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Total cell lysate and culture medium (M) immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit antiserum were used as negative controls (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2). The immunodetection by anti-srPLA2 antibodies was specific because incubation of the serum with the antigenic peptide precluded detection of the 17-kDa band (Fig. 4 B). The absence of detectable 14-kDa srPLA2 in the total cell lysate blot was probably due to low amounts of this protein in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4 A,lane 5). A direct association between the v-Src protein and the precursor form of srPLA2 in transformed cells was detected. After immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-Src antibodies, a protein (17 kDa) recognized by anti-srPLA2 antibodies was observed (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The v-Src protein contains tyrosine kinase activity. We surmised that the interaction between srPLA2 and Src could bring about phosphorylation of srPLA2 on tyrosine. To examine this hypothesis, the blots reacting with srPLA2 anti-serum were stripped and reprobed with the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20. Fig. 4 C shows that both 17- (Fig. 4 C,lane 3) and 14-kDa forms (Fig. 4 C, lane 4) are phosphorylated on tyrosine. The phosphorylation of srPLA2protein was confirmed using the reciprocal procedures: the total phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were precipitated from culture medium and cell lysates by anti-phosphotyrosin"
