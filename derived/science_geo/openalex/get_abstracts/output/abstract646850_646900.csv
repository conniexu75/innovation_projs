https://openalex.org/W3003408469,"Health implications to the population due to the consumption of contaminated vegetables has been a great concern all over the world. In this study, the levels of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Zn, Fe, Pb, As, Mn, Cu, Hg, Ni and Co) in soil and commonly consumed vegetables from Mojo area in central Ethiopia have been determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrophotometer (ICP-OES) and possible health risks due to the consumptions of the vegetables have also been estimated. The levels of As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Hg and Co were exceeded the reference level in agricultural soil. Likewise, As, Pb, Cd, Cr and Hg levels exceeded the recommended values in vegetable samples with concentrations ranging from 1.93-5.73, 3.63-7.56, 0.56-1.56, 1.49-4.63 and 3.43-4.23 mg/kg, respectively. It was observed that leafy vegetable (cabbage) has accumulated heavy metals to greater extent compared with tomato. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of toxic metals due to the consumption of the vegetables were below the maximum tolerable daily intake (MTDI). However, the total health quotient (THQ), calculated based on EDI of the heavy metals were found > 1 for As and Hg due to tomato consumption and for As, Hg and Co due to cabbage consumption, suggesting significant health risk. The health index (HI) due to the intake of toxic metals from the consumption of both vegetables were much > 1, with HI values of 7.205 and 15.078 due to tomato and cabbage consumption, respectively. This clearly suggests the possible adverse health effect to adult population from the consumption of tomato and cabbage from the study area. The total cancer risk (TCR) analysis have also revealed the potential adverse cancer risk induced by As, Cd, Hg, and Ni from the consumption of both tomato and cabbage as their TCR values were above the threshold level. Based on the results of this study, there would be a significant health risk (both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic) to the consumer associated with the consumption of cabbage and tomato being cultivated in Mojo area. Consequently, we recommend a strict regulatory control on the safety of vegetables originated from the study area."
https://openalex.org/W3003542953,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-enclosed vesicles which play important role for cell communication and physiology. EVs are found in many human biological fluids, including blood, breast milk, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ejaculate, saliva etc. These nano-sized vesicles contain proteins, mRNAs, microRNAs, non-coding RNAs and lipids that are derived from producing cells. EVs deliver complex sets of biological information to recipient cells thereby modulating their behaviors by their molecular cargo. In this way EVs are involved in the pathological development and progression of many human disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. In this study EVs purified by ultracentrifugation from CSF of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and individuals of the comparison group were characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis, flow cytometry and cryo-electron microscopy. Vesicular size and the presence of exosomal marker CD9 on the surface provided evidence that most of the EVs were exosome-like vesicles. Cryo-electron microscopy allowed us to visualize a large spectrum of extracellular vesicles of various size and morphology with lipid bilayers and vesicular internal structures. Thus, we described the diversity and new characteristics of the vesicles from CSF suggesting that subpopulations of EVs with different and specific functions may exist."
https://openalex.org/W3003588615,"We report on the genomic characterization of 47 multi-drug resistant, carbapenem resistant and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from the influent (I) and effluent (E) of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and from Romanian hospital units which are discharging the wastewater in the sampled WWTPs. The K. pneumoniae whole genome sequences were analyzed for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes and sequence types (STs) in order to compare their distribution in C, I and E samples. Both clinical and environmental samples harbored prevalent and widely distributed ESBL genes, i.e. blaSHV, blaOXA, blaTEM and blaCTX M. The most prevalent carbapenemase genes were blaNDM-1, blaOXA-48 and blaKPC-2. They were found in all types of isolates, while blaOXA-162, a rare blaOXA-48 variant, was found exclusively in water samples. A higher diversity of carbapenemases genes was seen in wastewater isolates. The aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AME) genes found in all types of samples were aac(6'), ant(2'')Ia, aph(3'), aaD, aac(3) and aph(6). Quinolone resistance gene qnrS1 and the multi-drug resistance oqxA/B pump gene were found in all samples, while qnrD and qnrB were associated to aquatic isolates. The antiseptics resistance gene qacEdelta1 was found in all samples, while qacE was detected exclusively in the clinical ones. Trimethroprim-sulfamethoxazole (dfrA, sul1 and sul2), tetracyclines (tetA and tetD) and fosfomycin (fosA6, known to be located on a transpozon) resistance genes were found in all samples, while for choramphenicol and macrolides some ARGs were detected in all samples (catA1 and catB3 / mphA), while other (catA2, cmIA5 and aac(6')Ib / mphE and msrE) only in wastewater samples. The rifampin resistance genes arr2 and 3 (both carried by class I integrons) were detected only in water samples. The highly prevalent ARGs preferentially associating with aquatic versus clinical samples could ascribe potential markers for the aquatic (blaSHV-145, qacEdelta1, sul1, aadA1, aadA2) and clinical (blaOXA-1, blaSHV-106,blaTEM-150, aac(3)Iia, dfrA14, oqxA10; oqxB17,catB3, tetD) reservoirs of AR. Moreover, some ARGs (oqxA10; blaSHV-145; blaSHV-100, aac(6')Il, aph(3')VI, armA, arr2, cmlA5, blaCMY-4, mphE, msrE, oqxB13, blaOXA-10) showing decreased prevalence in influent versus effluent wastewater samples could be used as markers for the efficiency of the WWTPs in eliminating AR bacteria and ARGs. The highest number of virulence genes (75) was recorded for the I samples, while for E and C samples it was reduced to half. The most prevalent belong to three functional groups: adherence (fim genes), iron acquisition (ent, fep, fyu, irp and ybt genes) and the secretion system (omp genes). However, none of the genes associated with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae have been found. A total of 14 STs were identified. The most prevalent clones were ST101, ST219 in clinical samples and ST258, ST395 in aquatic isolates. These STs were also the most frequently associated with integrons. ST45 and ST485 were exclusively associated with I samples, ST11, ST35, ST364 with E and ST1564 with C samples. The less frequent ST17 and ST307 aquatic isolates harbored blaOXA-162, which was co-expressed in our strains with blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1."
https://openalex.org/W3003669909,"Human-use pharmaceuticals in urban streams link aquatic-ecosystem health to human health. Pharmaceutical mixtures have been widely reported in larger streams due to historical emphasis on wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) sources, with limited investigation of pharmaceutical exposures and potential effects in smaller headwater streams. In 2014-2017, the United States Geological Survey measured 111 pharmaceutical compounds in 308 headwater streams (261 urban-gradient sites sampled 3-5 times, 47 putative low-impact sites sampled once) in 4 regions across the US. Simultaneous exposures to multiple pharmaceutical compounds (pharmaceutical mixtures) were observed in 91% of streams (248 urban-gradient, 32 low-impact), with 88 analytes detected across all sites and cumulative maximum concentrations up to 36,142 ng/L per site. Cumulative detections and concentrations correlated to urban land use and presence/absence of permitted WWTP discharges, but pharmaceutical mixtures also were common in the 75% of sampled streams without WWTP. Cumulative exposure-activity ratios (EAR) indicated widespread transient exposures with high probability of molecular effects to vertebrates. Considering the potential individual and interactive effects of the detected pharmaceuticals and the recognized analytical underestimation of the pharmaceutical-contaminant (unassessed parent compounds, metabolites, degradates) space, these results demonstrate a nation-wide environmental concern and the need for watershed-scale mitigation of in-stream pharmaceutical contamination."
https://openalex.org/W3003442733,"Web-based experimentation with uncompensated and unsupervised samples allows for a larger and more diverse sample population, more generalizable results, and faster theory to experiment cycle. Given that participants are unsupervised, it is still unknown whether the data collected in such settings would be of sufficiently high quality to support robust conclusions. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of conducting such experiments online using virtual environment technologies. We conducted a conceptual replication of two prior experiments that have been conducted in virtual environments. Our results replicate findings previously obtained in conventional laboratory settings. These results hold across different device types of participants (ranging from desktop, through mobile devices to immersive virtual reality headsets), suggesting that experiments can be conducted online with uncompensated samples in virtual environments."
https://openalex.org/W3003882206,"Suicide is a major public health problem globally. Data on the factors influencing suicidal behaviours that can inform prevention policies are limited in Bhutan. This study used the dataset of the nationally-representative Bhutan STEPS Survey conducted in 2014 that assessed the non-communicable disease risk factors. Using a backward elimination approach, multiple logistic regression analysis accounting for the complex survey design was performed to identify the factors associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adults separately. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt was 3.1% and 0.7%, respectively. We found female gender, being unemployed, low and middle household income than high household income, and having a family history of suicide were associated with higher odds of having suicidal ideation. Younger age and alcohol consumption were associated with both suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. While those from the middle-income group compared to those in the high-income group had reduced odds of attempting suicide. The findings can help inform policy investments for suicide prevention. Prevention programs that target young people, females, and low socioeconomic groups, and aimed to reduce harmful alcohol use can help prevent suicidal behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W3004111936,"Nationally representative data on the micronutrient status of Ghanaian women and children are very scarce. We aimed to document the current national prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, anemia, malaria, inflammation, α-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and trait, and under- and over-nutrition in Ghana. In 2017, a two-stage cross-sectional design was applied to enroll pre-school children (6–59 months) and non-pregnant women (15–49 years) from three strata in Ghana: Northern, Middle and Southern Belt. Household and individual questionnaire data were collected along with blood samples. In total, 2123 households completed the household interviews, 1165 children and 973 women provided blood samples. Nationally, 35.6% (95%CI: 31.7,39.6) of children had anemia, 21.5% (18.4,25.0) had iron deficiency, 12.2% (10.1,14.7) had iron deficiency anemia, and 20.8% (18.1,23.9) had vitamin A deficiency; 20.3%(15.2,26.6) tested positive for malaria, 13.9% (11.1,17.3) for sickle trait plus disease, and 30.7% (27.5,34.2) for α-thalassemia. Anemia and micronutrient deficiencies were more prevalent in rural areas, poor households and in the Northern Belt. Stunting and wasting affected 21.4% (18.0,25.2) and 7.0% (5.1,9.5) of children, respectively. Stunting was more common in rural areas and in poor households. Among non-pregnant women, 21.7% (18.7,25.1) were anemic, 13.7% (11.2,16.6) iron deficient, 8.9% (6.7,11.7) had iron deficiency anemia, and 1.5% (0.8,2.9) were vitamin A deficient, 53.8% (47.6,60.0) were folate deficient, and 6.9% (4.8,9.8) were vitamin B12 deficient. Malaria parasitemia in women [8.4% (5.7,12.2)] was lower than in children, but the prevalence of sickle cell disease or trait and α-thalassemia were similar. Overweight [24.7% (21.0,28.8)] and obesity [14.3% (11.5,17.7)] were more common in wealthier, older, and urban women. Our findings demonstrate that anemia and several micronutrient deficiencies are highly present in Ghana calling for the strengthening of Ghana’s food fortification program while overweight and obesity in women are constantly increasing and need to be addressed urgently through governmental policies and programs."
https://openalex.org/W3003328593,"Proprioceptive development relies on a variety of sensory inputs, among which vision is hugely dominant. Focusing on the developmental trajectory underpinning the integration of vision and proprioception, the present research explores how this integration is involved in interactions with Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) by examining how proprioceptive accuracy is affected by Age, Perception, and Environment. Individuals from 4 to 43 years old completed a self-turning task which asked them to manually return to a previous location with different sensory modalities available in both IVR and reality. Results were interpreted from an exploratory perspective using Bayesian model comparison analysis, which allows the phenomena to be described using probabilistic statements rather than simplified reject/not-reject decisions. The most plausible model showed that 4–8-year-old children can generally be expected to make more proprioceptive errors than older children and adults. Across age groups, proprioceptive accuracy is higher when vision is available, and is disrupted in the visual environment provided by the IVR headset. We can conclude that proprioceptive accuracy mostly develops during the first eight years of life and that it relies largely on vision. Moreover, our findings indicate that this proprioceptive accuracy can be disrupted by the use of an IVR headset."
https://openalex.org/W3003204848,"The coexistence of large mammals and humans in the contemporary landscape is a big challenge for conservationists. Wild ungulates that forage on arable fields are exposed to the negative effects of pesticides, and this problem also applies to protected species for which intoxication by pesticides may pose a health risk and directly affect the effectiveness of conservation efforts. In this paper we assessed the threat posed by pesticides to the European bison Bison bonasus, a species successfully restituted after being extinct in the wild. We studied samples of B. bonasus liver from three free-living populations in Poland (Białowieska, Knyszyńska, and Borecka forests) and captive individuals from breeding centres. LC-QTOF-MS/MS two-step analysis for the detection, identification and confirmation of pesticide residues in liver samples, which included MS and targeted MS/MS scans, was conducted. It was found that European bison are exposed to pesticides as a result of crop depredation: the presence of tetraconazole, fluopyram and diazinon residues in 12 liver samples was confirmed. The concentration levels of the detected substances were quite low, but in the liver samples more than one substance was usually found, and the potential health risk to European bison may result from the synergistic interaction of these substances. The place of occurrence of the population, abundance, and the management regime affect the exposure of European bison to pesticides. Due to the high conservation status of the European bison, the monitoring of intoxication by pesticides should be included in the conservation plans of this species. This issue should also be more widely included in the study of other wild ungulates because knowledge about the impact of pesticides on wildlife is still insufficient."
https://openalex.org/W3003634797,"A concerted action on the part of international agencies and national governments has resulted in the near-eradication of poliomyelitis. However, both the oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) have deficiencies which make them suboptimal for use after global eradication. OPV is composed of attenuated Sabin strains and stimulates robust immunity, but may revert to neurovirulent forms in the intestine which can be shed and infect susceptible contacts. The majority of IPV products are manufactured using pathogenic strains inactivated with formalin. Upon eradication, the production of large quantities of pathogenic virus will present an increased biosecurity hazard. A logical ideal endgame vaccine would be an inactivated form of an attenuated strain that could afford protective immunity while safely producing larger numbers of doses per unit of virus stock than current vaccines. We report here the development of an ionizing radiation (IR)-inactivated Sabin-based vaccine using a reconstituted Mn-decapeptide (MDP) antioxidant complex derived from the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. In bacteria, Mn2+-peptide antioxidants protect proteins from oxidative damage caused by extreme radiation exposure. Here we show for the first time, that MDP can protect immunogenic neutralizing epitopes in picornaviruses. MDP protects epitopes in Polio Virus 1 and 2 Sabin strains (PV1-S and PV2-S, respectively), but viral genomic RNA is not protected during supralethal irradiation. IR-inactivated Sabin viruses stimulated equivalent or improved neutralizing antibody responses in Wistar rats compared to the commercially used IPV products. Our approach reduces the biosecurity risk of the current PV vaccine production method by utilizing the Sabin strains instead of the wild type neurovirulent strains. Additionally, the IR-inactivation approach could provide a simpler, faster and less costly process for producing a more immunogenic IPV. Gamma-irradiation is a well-known method of virus inactivation and this vaccine approach could be adapted to any pathogen of interest."
https://openalex.org/W3003506460,"Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cause the protein to aggregate via a prion-like process in which soluble molecules are recruited to aggregates by conformational templating. These misfolded SOD1 proteins can propagate aggregation-inducing conformations across cellular membranes. Prior studies demonstrated that mutation of a Trp (W) residue at position 32 to Ser (S) suppresses the propagation of misfolded conformations between cells, whereas other studies have shown that mutation of Trp 32 to Phe (F), or Cys 111 to Ser, can act in cis to attenuate aggregation of mutant SOD1. By expressing mutant SOD1 fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), we compared the relative ability of these mutations to modulate the formation of inclusions by ALS-mutant SOD1 (G93A and G85R). Only mutation of Trp 32 to Ser persistently reduced the formation of the amorphous inclusions that form in these cells, consistent with the idea that a Ser at position 32 inhibits templated propagation of aggregation prone conformations. To further test this idea, we produced aggregated fibrils of recombinant SOD1-W32S in vitro and injected them into the spinal cords of newborn mice expressing G85R-SOD1: YFP. The injected mice developed an earlier onset paralysis with a frequency similar to mice injected with WT SOD1 fibrils, generating a strain of misfolded SOD1 that produced highly fibrillar inclusion pathology. These findings suggest that the effect of Trp 32 in modulating the propagation of misfolded SOD1 conformations may be dependent upon the “strain” of the conformer that is propagating."
https://openalex.org/W3003373588,"We investigated whether the integration of machine learning (ML) into MRI interpretation can provide accurate decision rules for the management of suspicious breast masses. A total of 173 consecutive patients with suspicious breast masses upon complementary assessment (BI-RADS IV/V: n = 100/76) received standardized breast MRI prior to histological verification. MRI findings were independently assessed by two observers (R1/R2: 5 years of experience/no experience in breast MRI) using six (semi-)quantitative imaging parameters. Interobserver variability was studied by ICC (intraclass correlation coefficient). A polynomial kernel function support vector machine was trained to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions based on the six imaging parameters and patient age. Ten-fold cross-validation was applied to prevent overfitting. Overall diagnostic accuracy and decision rules (rule-out criteria) to accurately exclude malignancy were evaluated. Results were integrated into a web application and published online. Malignant lesions were present in 107 patients (60.8%). Imaging features showed excellent interobserver variability (ICC: 0.81–0.98) with variable diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.65–0.82). Overall performance of the ML algorithm was high (AUC = 90.1%; BI-RADS IV: AUC = 91.6%). The ML algorithm provided decision rules to accurately rule-out malignancy with a false negative rate <1% in 31.3% of the BI-RADS IV cases. Thus, integration of ML into MRI interpretation can provide objective and accurate decision rules for the management of suspicious breast masses, and could help to reduce the number of potentially unnecessary biopsies."
https://openalex.org/W3003333616,"The restoration of mangroves has gained prominence in recent decades. Hydrological rehabilitation has been undertaken to connect impaired mangroves with the sea, lagoons or estuaries. Because mangrove hydrodynamics occurs on the surface and interstitial spaces in the sediment, we propose to determine the hydrological flow paths to restore the hydrological regimes of the impaired mangroves. The hydrological flow paths were determined through a micro basin analysis based on microtopographic data to generate a digital elevation model. Applying this methodological approach, the hydrology of an impaired area on a barrier island in the Gulf of Mexico was restored by excavating, desilting or clearing the channels on the identified hydrological flow paths. This area was compared to one in which impaired mangroves were reconnected to the marine lagoon but disregarding the flow paths. Data collected in both areas were evaluated by flood level analysis, using two methods: (i) a simple linear regression model (SLRM) and (ii) spectral analysis (SA), also known as dominant frequency analysis. The results suggest that restoration based on the hydrological flow paths was more effective than the direct opening to the nearest main water body without accounting for the microtopography. In both areas, soil salinity and sulfides decreased after hydrological reconnection. However, a greater efficiency in the investment of time and human resources was achieved when preferential flow paths were identified and taken into account. The methodological procedures described in this study are of universal application to other mangrove restoration programs."
https://openalex.org/W3003990661,"A hallmark of Niemann-Pick disease, type C (NPC) is the progressive degeneration of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum caused by the accumulation of free cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the lysosome. Recent studies suggest that the state of glycosylation of lysosomal membrane proteins may play a role in disease progression. Our study has identified the presence of a highly glycosylated form of Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) that correlated spatiotemporally with Purkinje neuron loss. This form of LAMP1 was predominantly localized to activated microglia; showing a ~5-fold increase in surface labeling by FACS analysis. This suggests a potential role for LAMP1 in the neuro-inflammatory process in these mice during disease progression. Analysis of other mouse models of neurodegeneration that exhibit neuro-inflammation showed little or no presence of this glycosylated form of LAMP1, suggesting this observation for LAMP1 is specific to NPC disease. Furthermore, early treatment of Npc1-/- mice with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD), significantly prevented the appearance of the glycosylated LAMP1 in the cerebellum of Npc1-/- mice at 7 weeks, consistent with the prevention of neuro-inflammation in mice treated with this drug. Treatment of Npc1-/- mice with HPβCD at 7 weeks, after disease onset, did not reverse or prevent further appearance of the hyperglycosylated LAMP1, demonstrating that once this aspect of neuro-inflammation began, it continued despite the HPβCD treatment. Analysis of LAMP1 in cerebellar tissue of NPC1 patients showed a small level of hyperglycosylated LAMP1 in the tissue, however, this was not seen in the CSF of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3003273689,"The plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) is often used for PVC medical devices, that are also largely used for intensive care medical treatments, like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. Due to the toxicological potential of DEHP, the inner exposure of patients with this plasticizer is a strong matter of concern as many studies have shown a high leaching potential of DEHP into blood. In this study, the inner DEHP exposure of patients undergoing ECMO treatment was investigated. The determined DEHP blood levels of ECMO patients and the patients of the control group ranged from 31.5 to 1009 μg/L (median 156.0 μg/L) and from 19.4 to 75.3 μg/L (median 36.4 μg/L), respectively. MEHP blood levels were determined to range from < LOD to 475 μg/L (median 15.9 μg/L) in ECMO patients and from < LOD to 9.9 μg/L (median 3.7 μg/L) in the control group patients, respectively. Increased DEHP exposure was associated with the number of cannulas and membranes of the ECMO setting, whereas residual diuresis decreased the exposure. Due to the suspected toxicological potential of DEHP, its use in medical devices should be further investigated, in particular for ICU patients with long-term exposure to PVC, like in ECMO therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3004295426,"HIV vaccine trials routinely measure multiple vaccine-elicited immune responses to compare regimens and study their potential associations with protection. Here we employ unsupervised learning tools facilitated by a bidirectional power transformation to explore the multivariate binding antibody and T-cell response patterns of immune responses elicited by two pox-protein HIV vaccine regimens. Both regimens utilized a recombinant canarypox vector (ALVAC-HIV) prime and a bivalent recombinant HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein 120 subunit boost. We hypothesized that within each trial, there were participant subgroups sharing similar immune responses and that their frequencies differed across trials.We analyzed data from three trials-RV144 (NCT00223080), HVTN 097 (NCT02109354), and HVTN 100 (NCT02404311), the latter of which was pivotal in advancing the tested pox-protein HIV vaccine regimen to the HVTN 702 Phase 2b/3 efficacy trial. We found that bivariate CD4+ T-cell and anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 antibody response patterns were similar by age, sex-at-birth, and body mass index, but differed for the pox-protein clade AE/B alum-adjuvanted regimen studied in RV144 and HVTN 097 (PAE/B/alum) compared to the pox-protein clade C/C MF59-adjuvanted regimen studied in HVTN 100 (PC/MF59). Specifically, more PAE/B/alum recipients had low CD4+ T-cell and high anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 responses, and more PC/MF59 recipients had broad responses of both types. Analyses limited to ""vaccine-matched"" antigens suggested that some of the differences in responses between the regimens could have been due to antigens in the assays that did not match the vaccine immunogens. Our approach was also useful in identifying subgroups with unusually absent or high co-responses across assay types, flagging individuals for further characterization by functional assays. We also found that co-responses of anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 and CD4+ T cells had broad variability. As additional immune response assays are standardized and validated, we anticipate our framework will be increasingly valuable for multivariate analysis.Our approach can be used to advance vaccine development objectives, including the characterization and comparison of candidate vaccine multivariate immune responses and improved design of studies to identify correlates of protection. For instance, results suggested that HVTN 702 will have adequate power to interrogate immune correlates involving anti-V1V2 IgG/IgG3 and CD4+ T-cell co-readouts, but will have lower power to study anti-gp120/gp140 IgG/IgG3 due to their lower dynamic ranges. The findings also generate hypotheses for future testing in experimental and computational analyses aimed at achieving a mechanistic understanding of vaccine-elicited immune response heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W3003494784,"As South Africa embarks on the implementation of the community health care worker (CHW) 2018 policy, quantifying the resource requirements to effectively manage the programme across different geographical communities is essential. This study was conducted to quantify and compare costs associated with travel and service delivery demands on CHWs between area types in two districts.This economic analysis adopted a provider perspective to cost CHW services between January and November 2016. A total of 221 CHWs completed diaries for 10 days to document their activities. Quintile regression and the Kruskall Wallis test were used to test for differences in time and activities across urban and rural sites.While travel time across rural and urban settings within each district did differ it was not the most significant predictor of differences in time utilization. Time on activities showed more significant differences with overall median time by unit of activity being 15% longer in rural than urban areas in Sedibeng and 10% longer in uMzinyathi respectively. Most CHW time was spent conducting home visits (57% in rural,66% in peri-urban/urban). Median time per home visit in uMzinyathi was 50% longer in deep-rural areas than urban areas and 20% longer in rural than urban areas in Sedibeng. Referrals and number of home visits per capita (0.4 visits in rural and 0.7 in urban/peri-urban areas) were low in both districts. Expenditure on the programme translated to under 4% of PHC expenditure per capita and remains under 5% if despite the new national minimum wage (R3,500/$245).Because home visits take longer and CHWs spend a lower share of time on visits, a higher number is required in rural and deep rural areas (33% and 66% respectively) than in urban areas. Effective budget planning will therefore need to recognize the different geographical needs."
https://openalex.org/W3003307339,"Background It is important to achieve the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal recommended by clinical guidelines in managing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events, however, the current management of LDL-C in actual clinical settings is suboptimal. We examined the LDL-C level among patients with dyslipidemia against the 2015 Korean guidelines, the crude rates of CV events based on LDL-C goal achievement, and the factors associated with LDL-C goal achievement. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance Service–National Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) database from 2006 to 2013. Patients who had a health examination with LDL-C measurement between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2011 were identified. Patients were required to have at least one diagnosis of dyslipidemia during the 1 year before the index date, defined as the first date of LDL-C measurement. The 2015 Korean guidelines were used to measure LDL-C goal achievement based on the CV risk level. Crude CV event rates were calculated for total and individual CV events as the number of events divided by person-years (PYs) during the follow-up period. CV events included acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, CV death, and all-cause death. Factors associated with LDL-C goal achievement were assessed using logistic regression. Results In the NHIS-HEALS database, 69,942 patients met the eligibility criteria: 36.7%, 22.5%, 20.1%, and 20.6% were among the very high-, high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups for the CV events, respectively, as defined by the 2015 Korean guidelines. Approximately half of the patients with dyslipidemia (47.6%) achieved their recommended LDL-C goal, but the achievement rates were substantially different across CV risk levels (17.6%, 47.2%, 66.9%, and 82.4% for very high-, high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups, respectively; P<0.0001). The crude event rate of total CV events during the follow-up period in the LDL-C goal non-achievers was higher than that in the LDL-C goal achievers (24.35/100 PYs vs. 11.93/100 PYs; P<0.0001). LDL-C goal achievement was significantly associated with patient characteristics, including age, sex, body mass index, lipid-modifying therapy, and CV risk level. Conclusions In South Korea, LDL-C goal achievement among patients with very high or high CV risk was suboptimal. Patients who did not achieve the goal showed a higher rate of CV events during the follow-up period than patients who achieved the goal. LDL-C management strategies should be highlighted in dyslipidemia patients who are less likely to achieve the goal, such as female, overweight or obese patients, patients not adherent to statin, or patients with very high or high CV risk."
https://openalex.org/W3003420230,"Background Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is a zoonotic infection that affects humans, dogs and many other mammalian species. Virtually any mammalian species can act as asymptomatic reservoir, characterized by chronic renal carriage and shedding of a host-adapted leptospiral serovar. Environmental contamination by chronic shedders results in acquisition of infection by humans and susceptible animals. Methods In this study, we investigated if clinically normal shelter dogs and cats harbor leptospires in their kidneys by screening urine samples for the presence of leptospiral DNA by a TaqMan based-quantitative PCR (qPCR) that targets pathogen-associated lipl32 gene. To identify the infecting leptospiral species, a fragment of leptospiral rpoB gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. Additionally, we measured Leptospira-specific serum antibodies using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a gold standard in leptospiral serology. Results A total of 269 shelter animals (219 dogs and 50 cats) from seven shelters located in the tri-state area of western Virginia, eastern Tennessee, and southeastern Kentucky were included in this study. All cats tested negative by both qPCR and MAT. Of the 219 dogs tested in the study, 26/198 (13.1%, 95% CI: 8.4–17.8%) were positive for leptospiral DNA in urine by qPCR and 38/211 (18.0%, 95% CI: 12.8–23.2%) were seropositive by MAT. Twelve dogs were positive for both qPCR and MAT. Fourteen dogs were positive by qPCR but not by MAT. Additionally, leptospiral rpoB gene sequencing from a sub-set of qPCR-positive urine samples (n = 21) revealed L. interrogans to be the leptospiral species shed by dogs. Conclusions These findings have significant implications regarding animal and public health in the Cumberland Gap Region and possibly outside where these animals may be adopted."
https://openalex.org/W3003863074,"Automatic optic disc (OD) localization and segmentation is not a simple process as the OD appearance and size may significantly vary from person to person. This paper presents a novel approach for OD localization and segmentation which is fast as well as robust. In the proposed method, the image is first enhanced by de-hazing and then cropped around the OD region. The cropped image is converted to HSV domain and then V channel is used for OD detection. The vessels are extracted from the Green channel in the cropped region by multi-scale line detector and then removed by the Laplace Transform. Local adaptive thresholding and region growing are applied for binarization. Furthermore, two region properties, eccentricity, and area are then used to detect the true OD region. Finally, ellipse fitting is used to fill the region. Several datasets are used for testing the proposed method. Test results show that the accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed method are much higher than the existing state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W3003597672,"Background and aims Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and problem gambling are highly comorbid disorders. This study aims to explore the role of four aspects of impulsivity (trait concept of impulsivity, choice impulsivity, impulsive aggression and response inhibition/decision-making) in long-term chronic AUD patients with and without problem or pathological gambling symptoms. Methods Cognitively intact chronic AUD patients were enrolled with (n = 32) and without (n = 71) problem gambling symptoms in an inpatient clinic for chronic alcohol users. Multiple facets of impulsivity, cognitive ability, psychopathological symptoms, alcohol and gambling severity were measured. Results Chronic AUD patients with gambling disorder symptoms showed longer lifetime alcohol consumption, more severe alcohol use and higher psychopathological symptom severity than AUD patients without gambling symptoms. Gambling severity correlated with overall trait impulsivity, but not with choice impulsivity, impulsive aggression or cognitive impulsivity with controlling for lifetime alcohol consumption, lifetime alcohol use and psychopathological symptom severity. High trait impulsivity and non-planning was associated with comorbid gambling symptoms in AUD patients, which was independent of the level of intelligence, age and psychopathological symptoms. Conclusion Comorbid gambling disorder symptoms in chronic AUD was connected to more severe alcohol-related variables. Higher trait impulsivity was also linked with gambling disorder symptoms in patients with chronic AUD. This accents the need of special focus on comorbid GD symptoms in AUD, since prognosis and treatment for them may vary."
https://openalex.org/W3003216687,"Identification of changes of phospholipid (PL) composition occurring during colorectal cancer (CRC) development may help us to better understand their roles in CRC cells. Here, we used LC-MS/MS-based PL profiling of cell lines derived from normal colon mucosa, or isolated at distinct stages of CRC development, in order to study alterations of PL species potentially linked with cell transformation. We found that a detailed evaluation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS) classes allowed us to cluster the studied epithelial cell lines according to their origin: i) cells originally derived from normal colon tissue (NCM460, FHC); ii) cell lines derived from colon adenoma or less advanced differentiating adenocarcinoma cells (AA/C1, HT-29); or, iii) cells obtained by in vitro transformation of adenoma cells and advanced colon adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-116, AA/C1/SB10, SW480, SW620). Although we tentatively identified several PS and PI species contributing to cell line clustering, full PI and PS profiles appeared to be a key to the successful cell line discrimination. In parallel, we compared PL composition of primary epithelial (EpCAM-positive) cells, isolated from tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues of colon cancer patients, with PL profiles of cell lines derived from normal colon mucosa (NCM460) and from colon adenocarcinoma (HCT-116, SW480) cells, respectively. In general, higher total levels of all PL classes were observed in tumor cells. The overall PL profiles of the cell lines, when compared with the respective patient-derived cells, exhibited similarities. Nevertheless, there were also some notable differences in levels of individual PL species. This indicated that epithelial cell lines, derived either from normal colon tissue or from CRC cells, could be employed as models for functional lipidomic analyses of colon cells, albeit with some caution. The biological significance of the observed PL deregulation, or their potential links with specific CRC stages, deserve further investigation."

Based on the three-phase voltage and current waveforms which are monitored through a single measurement in the network, several features are extracted using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The extracted features are then fed into the optimized artificial neural network (ANN) to estimate the HIF impedance and its distance. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is employed to optimize the parameters of the ANN to enhance the performance of fault impedance and distance estimations. Based on the simulation results, the proposed method records encouraging results compared to other methods of similar complexity for both HIF impedance values and estimated distances."
https://openalex.org/W3004347236,"Magnesium-based biomaterials are attracting increasingly more attention for orthopedic applications based on their appropriate mechanical properties, biodegradability, and favorable biocompatibility. However, the high corrosion rate of these materials remains to be addressed. In this study, porous β-Ca3(PO4)2/Mg-Zn (β-TCP/Mg-Zn) composites were fabricated via a powder metallurgy method. The β-TCP/Mg-Zn composites with 6% porosity exhibited optimal mechanical properties, and thus, they were selected for surface modification. A novel dopamine/gelatin/recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) coating with demonstrated stability was prepared to further improve the corrosion resistance of the composite and enhance early osteoinductivity. The homogeneously coated β-TCP/Mg-Zn composite showed significantly improved corrosion resistance according to electrochemical and immersion tests. In addition, extracts from the dopamine/gelatin/rhBMP-2–coated β-TCP/Mg-Zn composite not only facilitated cell proliferation but also significantly enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of Sprague–Dawley rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the biodegradation, histocompatibility, and osteoinductive potential of the coated composite. No obvious pathological changes in the vital visceral organs were observed after implantation, and radiography and hematoxylin-eosin staining showed strong promotion of new bone formation, matched composite degradation and bone regeneration rates, and complete absorption of the released hydrogen gas. Collectively, these results indicate that the dopamine/gelatin/rhBMP-2–coated β-TCP/Mg-Zn composite offers improved corrosion resistance, favorable biocompatibility, and enhanced osteoinductive potential for use in the fabrication of orthopedic implants."
https://openalex.org/W3003429224,"Objective One of the common complications occurring after cranioplasty (CP) is aseptic bone-flap resorption (ABFR). Reoperation necessary because of the development of ABFR can lead to unfavorable complications during subsequent surgery using a synthetic skull implant, and also necessarily leads to higher costs. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors that may help to predict the development of ABFR. Methods In this study, 303 CP surgeries performed between 2002 and 2017 were examined retrospectively to identify factors predicting the occurrence of ABFR. A number of these factors (e.g., time lapse between decompressive craniectomy (DC) and CP, bone-flap size, specific laboratory signs, and the reason for the original DC) were analyzed as possibly influencing the risk of developing ABFR. Results ABFR of an autologous bone flap that subsequently required a CP with synthetic skull implants occurred in 10 of 303 patients (3.0%). CP timing and patients' Karnofsky Performance Scores (KPS) (p = 0.008; p = 0.012) were identified as significant factors with an impact on the development of ABRF. Age did not reveal a significant value, but statistical analysis shows a clear trend. The younger the age, the more likely it was that an ABFR would develop. Conclusion The risk of ABFR lessens the longer the period of time elapsed between DC and CP. Age does not reveal a significant value, but statistical analysis shows that there is a clear trend."
https://openalex.org/W3003926603,"The taxonomy of foot shapes or other parts of the body is important, especially for design purposes. We propose a methodology based on archetypoid analysis (ADA) that overcomes the weaknesses of previous methodologies used to establish typologies. ADA is an objective, data-driven methodology that seeks extreme patterns, the archetypal profiles in the data. ADA also explains the data as percentages of the archetypal patterns, which makes this technique understandable and accessible even for non-experts. Clustering techniques are usually considered for establishing taxonomies, but we will show that finding the purest or most extreme patterns is more appropriate than using the central points returned by clustering techniques. We apply the methodology to an anthropometric database of 775 3D right foot scans representing the Spanish adult female and male population for footwear design. Each foot is described by a 5626 × 3 configuration matrix of landmarks. No multivariate features are used for establishing the taxonomy, but all the information gathered from the 3D scanning is employed. We use ADA for shapes described by landmarks. Women’s and men’s feet are analyzed separately. We have analyzed 3 archetypal feet for both men and women. These archetypal feet could not have been recovered using multivariate techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3003987895,"Novel bio-imaging techniques such as micro-Computed Tomography provide an opportunity to investigate animal anatomy and morphology by overcoming limitations imposed by traditional anatomical drawings. The primate genital bones are complex anatomical structures whose occurrence in both male penis (baculum) and female clitoris (baubellum) may be difficult to assess in individual cadavers. We tested a 3-step methodological protocol, including different techniques ranging from inexpensive/simple to more expensive/sophisticated ones, by applying it to a sample of primate species, and resulting in different levels of data complexity: (1) presence/absence manual palpation method; (2) 2D X-ray plates; 3) 3D micro-CT scans. Manual palpation failed on 2 out of 23 specimens by detecting 1 false negative and 1 false positive; radiography failed once confirming the false positive, however firmly disproved by micro-CT; micro-CT analysis reported the presence of 9 bacula out of 11 male specimens and 1 baubellum out of 12 female specimens. A different baculum position was identified between strepsirrhine and haplorrhine species. We also aim to assess micro-CT as a non-invasive technique providing updated anatomical descriptions of primate ossa genitalia. Micro-CT 3D volumes showed the surface of some bones as rough, with a jagged appearance, whereas in others the surface appeared very smooth and coherent. In addition, four main types of bone internal structure were identified: 1) totally hollow; 2) hollow epiphyses and solid diaphysis with few or several channels inside; 3) totally solid with intricate Haversian channels; 4) totally solid with some channels (structure of single baubellum scanned). Ossa genitalia appeared as a living tissue having its own Haversian-like channels. The high resolution of micro-CT 3D-images of primate genital bones disclosed additional form variability to that available from genital bone 2D images of previous studies, and showed for the first time new internal and external morphological characters. Moreover, micro-CT non-invasive approach proved appropriate to recover much of scientific knowledge still hidden and often neglected in both museum specimens and primate cadavers only destined to necropsy."
https://openalex.org/W3004116341,"DNA from formalin-preserved tissue could unlock a vast repository of genetic information stored in museums worldwide. However, formaldehyde crosslinks proteins and DNA, and prevents ready amplification and DNA sequencing. Formaldehyde acylation also fragments the DNA. Treatment with proteinase K proteolyzes crosslinked proteins to rescue the DNA, though the process is quite slow. To reduce processing time and improve rescue efficiency, we applied the mechanical energy of a vortex fluidic device (VFD) to drive the catalytic activity of proteinase K and recover DNA from American lobster tissue (Homarus americanus) fixed in 3.7% formalin for >1-year. A scan of VFD rotational speeds identified the optimal rotational speed for recovery of PCR-amplifiable DNA and while 500+ base pairs were sequenced, shorter read lengths were more consistently obtained. This VFD-based method also effectively recovered DNA from formalin-preserved samples. The results provide a roadmap for exploring DNA from millions of historical and even extinct species."
https://openalex.org/W3003421818,"Glottal insufficiency due to vocal fold paralysis, paresis, or atrophy often leads to degraded voice quality. One of the primary surgical intervention procedures to treat glottal insufficiency is medialization laryngoplasty, in which an implant is inserted through a lateral window on the thyroid cartilage to medialize the vocal folds. While the goal of medialization is to modify the vocal fold structure to restore normal phonation, few studies have attempted to quantify such structural changes of the vocal folds. The goal of this study is to quantify the three-dimensional structural changes of the vocal folds due to implant insertion in medialization laryngoplasty, and evaluate its potential effect on voice production. Medialization laryngoplasty were performed in excised human larynges using implants of different stiffness. Magnetic resonance images of the larynges were obtained with and without implant insertion. The results showed that implant insertion significantly changed the original body-cover structure of the vocal folds, with the implant taking over the large space used to be occupied by the original body layer and the vocal fold being stretched into a thin layer wrapped around the implant. The medial-lateral dimension of the vocal fold was significantly reduced from about 4 mm to 1 mm, and the vocal fold was stretched in the coronal plane by about 70%. It is hypothesized that use of implants with stiffness comparable to that of the vocal folds is beneficial because the degree of medialization can be adjusted without much negative effects on phonation frequency, phonation threshold pressure, or vibration amplitude."

Although the distribution of major multilocus sequence types (STs) was similar between the studies, there were changes in both the abundance of minority STs associated with the T86I mutation, and the abundance of clones within single STs associated with the T86I mutation.Four population-based studies of community diarrhoea over a 25 year period revealed an increase over time in the prevalence of the T86I amongst isolates of C. jejuni associated with human gastrointestinal disease in the UK. Although associated with many STs, much of the increase is due to the expansion of clones associated with the resistance mutation."
https://openalex.org/W3003248276,"Chemoprophylaxis (antibiotic prophylaxis) is a long relied-upon means of opportunistic infection management among HIV/AIDS patients, but its use represents an evolutionary tradeoff: Despite the benefits of chemoprophylaxis, widespread use of antibiotics creates a selective advantage for drug-resistant bacterial strains. Especially in the developing world, with combined resource limitations, antibiotic misuse, and often-poor infection control, the emergence of antibiotic resistance may pose a critical health risk. Extending previous work that demonstrated that this risk is heightened when a significant proportion of the population is HIV/AIDS-immunocompromised, we work to address the relationship between HIV/AIDS patients’ use of antibiotic chemoprophylaxis and the emergence of resistance. We apply an SEIR compartmental model, parameterized to reflect varying percentages of chemoprophylaxis use among HIV/AIDS+ patients in a resource-limited setting, to investigate the magnitude of the risk of prophylaxis-associated emergence versus the individual-level benefits it is presumed to provide. The results from this model suggest that, while still providing tangible benefits to the individual, chemoprophylaxis is associated with negligible decreases in population-wide morbidity and mortality from bacterial infection, and may also fail to provide assumed efficacy in reduction of TB prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W3003376105,"Social organizations, especially human society, rely on egalitarian social norm, which can be characterized by high levels of fairness, empathy and collective conformity. Nevertheless, the evolution of egalitarian social norm remains a conundrum, as it suffers the persistent challenge from individual self-interest. To address this issue, we construct an evolutionary game theoretical model by employing the Ultimatum Game, in which rational individuals are able to perform resource management. We show that resource management drives a population evolving into an oscillatory state with high equilibrium degrees of fairness, empathy and collective conformity and thus constitutes a key mechanism for the evolution of egalitarian social norm in social dilemma situations. Specifically, it results in (1) the formation of egalitarian social norm from diverse individual norms, (2) the emergence of egalitarian social norm in a selfish and unfair world, and (3) the maintenance of egalitarian social norm despite the presence of norm violators. The constructive role of resource management is explained by a mean-field analysis revealing that resource management can effectively enlarge the attraction basin of egalitarian norms or even change the dynamical property of the mini Ultimatum Game from bistability between egalitarian norms and less egalitarian norms to complete-dominance of egalitarian norms over less egalitarian norms. Furthermore, we find that the capacity of resource management can be evolutionarily selected by a coevolution between egalitarian social norm and resource management. Our study suggests that efficiency and equity are linked to each other."
https://openalex.org/W3003514983,"The notion that death represents a passing to an afterlife, where we are reunited with loved ones and live eternally in a utopian paradise, is common in the reports of people who have encountered a “Near-Death Experience” (NDE). NDEs are thoroughly portrayed by the media but empirical studies are rather recent. The definition of the phenomenon as well as the identification of NDE experiencers is still a matter of debate. To date, NDEs’ identification and description in studies have mostly derived from answered items in questionnaires. However, questionnaires’ content could be restricting and subject to personal interpretation. We believe that in addition to their use, user-independent statistical text examination of freely expressed NDEs narratives is of prior importance to help capture the phenomenology of such a subjective and complex phenomenon. Towards that aim, we included 158 participants with a firsthand retrospective narrative of their self-reported NDE that we analyzed using an automated text-mining method. The output revealed the top words expressed by experiencers. In a second step, a hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted to visualize the relationships between these words. It revealed three main clusters of features: visual perceptions, emotions and spatial components. We believe the user-independent and data-driven text mining approach used in this study is promising by contributing to the building a rigorous description and definition of NDEs."
https://openalex.org/W3003567371,"Factors governing the distribution of organisms in the pelagic ocean are understudied. In this paper we describe environmental parameters and macrofouling assemblages on 11 buoys deployed in the Arabian Sea for an average duration of 322 days. Macrofoulants on all the mooring components extending from the sea-surface to a depth of 1800-4300 m were documented. Role of temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biological productivity and zooplankton community in governing the macrofoulant distribution are described. Species composition, vertical zonation and wet biomass exhibited significant spatial variations. Lepas anatifera constituted more than 90% of foulant wet biomass on all moorings. Assemblages in the southeastern (SEAS), east-central (ECAS) and northeast (NEAS) regions were distinct. Density of L. anatifera on surface buoys were low in SEAS (0.2±0.09 no./cm2), high in ECAS (0.32±0.11 no./cm2) and moderate in NEAS (0.23±0.04no./cm2). Macrofoulants were observed up to a depth of 75 m in SEAS, 130 m in ECAS and 120 m in NEAS. The depth profile of macrofoulant assemblages on moorings could be related to the prevalent hypoxic condition. Vertical profiles of wet biomass on all moorings exhibited subsurface maxima at depth ranging from 10 to 20 m, consequent to the abundance of L. anatifera in a thermally stable depth of water column, wherein diurnal and semidiurnal temperature variability was minimal. We attribute the observed variation in fouling assemblages to dissolved oxygen levels, salinity and diurnal variability in temperature and salinity."
https://openalex.org/W3003788348,"Fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone is a complex disease of the skeleton caused by dominant activating mutations of the GNAS locus encoding for the α subunit of the G protein-coupled receptor complex (Gsα). The mutation involves a substitution of arginine at position 201 by histidine or cysteine (GsαR201H or R201C), which leads to overproduction of cAMP. Several signaling pathways are implicated downstream of excess cAMP in the manifestation of disease. However, the pathogenesis of FD remains largely unknown. The overall FD phenotype can be attributed to alterations of skeletal stem/progenitor cells which normally develop into osteogenic or adipogenic cells (in cis), and are also known to provide support to angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and osteoclastogenesis (in trans). In order to dissect the molecular pathways rooted in skeletal stem/progenitor cells by FD mutations, we engineered human skeletal stem/progenitor cells with the GsαR201C mutation and performed transcriptomic analysis. Our data suggest that this FD mutation profoundly alters the properties of skeletal stem/progenitor cells by pushing them towards formation of disorganized bone with a concomitant alteration of adipogenic differentiation. In addition, the mutation creates an altered in trans environment that induces neovascularization, cytokine/chemokine changes and osteoclastogenesis. In silico comparison of our data with the signature of FD craniofacial samples highlighted common traits, such as the upregulation of ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) proteins and other matrix-related factors, and of PDE7B (Phosphodiesterase 7B), which can be considered as a buffering process, activated to compensate for excess cAMP. We also observed high levels of CEBPs (CCAAT-Enhancer Binding Proteins) in both data sets, factors related to browning of white fat. This is the first analysis of the reaction of human skeletal stem/progenitor cells to the introduction of the FD mutation and we believe it provides a useful background for further studies on the molecular basis of the disease and for the identification of novel potential therapeutic targets."

A total of 130 lepidopteran larvae were selected from 37 fogging samples at the Panguana station, district Yuyapichis, province Puerto Inca, department Huánuco, Peru. Target trees were pre-identified and subsequently submitted to molecular confirmation of identity with three markers (rbcL, psbA and trnL-F). The COI gene of 119 lepidopteran larvae was successfully sequenced and found to belong to 92 species: Comparison of DNA barcodes with the reference database of adult moths resulted in 65 (55%) matches at species level, 32 (27%) at genus level, 19 (16%) at subfamily or family level, three just to order level. Three larvae could not be assigned to a family. For these larvae the fogged target tree now suggests a potential host-plant relationship. Molecular gut content analysis, based on High-Throughput-Sequencing was successfully tested for ten larvae corroborating feeding on the target plant in some cases but elucidating several other cases of potential ‘alternative feeding’. We propose a larger-scale approach using this rapid and efficient method including molecular gut-content analyses for comprehensively testing the ratio of ‘alternative feeders’ and pitfalls caused by collateral fogging of larvae from neighboring trees."
https://openalex.org/W3003909659,"Evidence from neuroimaging and brain stimulation studies suggest that visual information about objects in the periphery is fed back to foveal retinotopic cortex in a separate representation that is essential for peripheral perception. The characteristics of this phenomenon have important theoretical implications for the role fovea-specific feedback might play in perception. In this work, we employed a recently developed behavioral paradigm to explore whether late disruption to central visual space impaired perception of color. In the first experiment, participants performed a shape discrimination task on colored novel objects in the periphery while fixating centrally. Consistent with the results from previous work, a visual distractor presented at fixation ~100ms after presentation of the peripheral stimuli impaired sensitivity to differences in peripheral shapes more than a visual distractor presented at other stimulus onset asynchronies. In a second experiment, participants performed a color discrimination task on the same colored objects. In a third experiment, we further tested for this foveal distractor effect with stimuli restricted to a low-level feature by using homogenous color patches. These two latter experiments resulted in a similar pattern of behavior: a central distractor presented at the critical stimulus onset asynchrony impaired sensitivity to peripheral color differences, but, importantly, the magnitude of the effect was stronger when peripheral objects contained complex shape information. These results show a behavioral effect consistent with disrupting feedback to the fovea, in line with the foveal feedback suggested by previous neuroimaging studies."
https://openalex.org/W3003606181,"Background Studies demonstrate an association between severe depression and overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). However, mild depression is constantly overlooked. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with mild depression in women with OAB. Methods Cross-sectional study involving 241 women over 60 years old in Brasilia, Brazil. All patients were subjected to an interview followed by questionnaires and physical examination. The clinical and sociodemographic variables analyzed were age, body mass index, physical activity level, OAB symptoms, presence of gynecological surgery, fecal incontinence, systemic arterial hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, anxiety (Beck Anxiety Scale). The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) was used to identify depression. Univariate logistic regression was used to assess the correlation between mild depression and the variables chosen. Variables with a p-value less than 0.2 were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The level of confidence was set at 95%. Results 121 volunteers suffered from mild depression. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that gynecological surgery (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .001) are factors associated with mild depression. Older women with a history of gynecological surgery and a GDS-15 score of 2.04 were 1.08 times more likely to develop mild depression compared to older women with no history of gynecological surgery. Conclusion Anxiety and a history of gynecological surgery are factors that need to be taken into account and may influence the development of mild depression in older women with OAB. Psychological treatment should be considered an important adjunct in the treatment of women with symptoms of Overactive Bladder Syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3003894093,"The Src substrate Tks5 helps scaffold matrix-remodeling invadopodia in invasive cancer cells. Focus was directed here on how the five SH3 domains of Tks5 impact that activity. Mutations designed to inhibit protein-protein interactions were created in the individual SH3 domains of Tks5, and the constructs were introduced into the LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell line, a model system with intrinsically low Tks5 expression and which our lab had previously showed the dependence of Src-dependent Tks5 phosphorylation on invadopodia development. In LNCaP cells, acute increases in wild-type Tks5 led to increased gelatin matrix degradation. A similar result was observed when Tks5 was mutated in its 4th or 5th SH3 domains. This was in contrast to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd SH3 domain mutations of Tks5 where each had a remarkable accentuating effect on gelatin degradation. Conversely, in the invadopodia-competent Src-3T3 model system, mutations in any one of the first three SH3 domains had a dominant negative effect that largely eliminated the presence of invadopodia, inhibited gelatin degradation activity, and redistributed both Src, cortactin, and Tks5 to what are likely endosomal compartments. A hypothesis involving Tks5 conformational states and the regulation of endosomal trafficking is presented as an explanation for these seemingly disparate results."
https://openalex.org/W3003958811,"Effective management of marine systems requires quantitative tools that can assess the state of the marine social-ecological system and are responsive to management actions and pressures. We applied the Ocean Health Index (OHI) framework to retrospectively assess ocean health in British Columbia annually from 2001 to 2016 for eight goals that represent the values of British Columbia’s coastal communities. We found overall ocean health improved over the study period, from 75 (out of 100) in 2001 to 83 in 2016, with scores for inhabited regions ranging from 68 (North Coast, 2002) to 87 (West Vancouver Island, 2011). Highest-scoring goals were Tourism & Recreation (average 94 over the period) and Habitat Services (100); lowest-scoring goals were Sense of Place (61) and Food Provision (64). Significant increases in scores over the time period occurred for Food Provision (+1.7 per year), Sense of Place (+1.4 per year), and Coastal Livelihoods (+0.6 per year), while Habitat Services (-0.01 per year) and Biodiversity (-0.09 per year) showed modest but statistically significant declines. From the results of our time-series analysis, we used the OHI framework to evaluate impacts of a range of management actions. Despite challenges in data availability, we found evidence for the ability of management to reduce pressures on several goals, suggesting the potential of OHI as a tool for assessing the effectiveness of marine resource management to improve ocean health. Our OHI assessment provides an important comprehensive evaluation of ocean health in British Columbia, and our open and transparent process highlights opportunities for improving accessibility of social and ecological data to inform future assessment and management of ocean health."

The objective of the current research was to investigate the impact of CS on the three heads of the triceps brachii (TB) muscle.Twenty-five young and healthy university students performed a triceps push-down exercise at 45% one repetition maximum (1RM) with and without CS until task failure, and the rate of fatigue (ROF), endurance time (ET) and number of repetitions (NR) for both exercises were analyzed. In addition, the first and last six repetitions of each exercise were considered non-fatiguing (NF) and fatiguing (Fa), respectively, and the root mean square (RMS), mean power frequency (MPF) and median frequency (MDF) for each exercise repetition were evaluated.The lateral and long head showed significant differences (P<0.05) in the ROF between the two exercises, and all the heads showed significant (P<0.05) differences in the RMS between the two exercises under NF conditions. Only the long head showed a significant difference (P<0.05) in the MPF and MDF between the two exercises. CS increases the ET (24.74%) and NR (27%) of the exercise. The three heads showed significant differences (P<0.05) in the RMS, MPF and MDF under all exercise conditions.A lower ROF was obtained with CS. In addition, the RMS was found to be better approximator of CS, whereas MPF and MDF were more resistant to the effect of CS. The results showed that the three heads worked independently under all conditions, and the non-synergist and synergist head pairs showed similar behavior under Fa conditions. The findings from this study provide additional insights regarding the functioning of each TB head."

Following an interpretive phenomenological content analysis, we were able to identify two central themes arising from the interviews: musicking as an intra-subjective experience and musicking as mediator of inter-subjective relationships. A further analysis revealed three superordinate themes: musicking as a secure place, musicking as a dialectic experience, and musicking as a means for identity reconstruction (bridging between past, present, and future). From this we concluded that for our interviewees musicking is a secure place for their wounded self, which allows the reconstruction of a coherent personal narrative while conducting a dialectic encounter with the trauma and its symptoms via nonverbal language. Consequently, we recommend musicking as a therapeutic tool for people coping with war-induced PTSD from both intrapersonal and interpersonal perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W3003770321,"Educational success measured by retention leading to graduation is an essential component of any academic institution. As such, identifying the factors that contribute significantly to success and addressing those factors that result in poor performances are important exercises. By success, we mean obtaining a semester GPA of 3.0 or better and a GPA of 2.0 or better. We identified these factors and related challenges through analytical models based on student performance. A large dataset obtained from a large state university over three consecutive semesters was utilized. At each semester, GPAs were nested within students and students were taking classes from multiple instructors and pursuing a specific major. Thus, we used multiple membership multiple classification (MMMC) Bayesian logistic regression models with random effects for instructors and majors to model success. The complexity of the analysis due to multiple membership modeling and a large number of random effects necessitated the use of Bayesian analysis. These Bayesian models identified factors affecting academic performance of college students while accounting for university instructors and majors as random effects. In particular, the models adjust for residency status, academic level, number of classes, student athletes, and disability residence services. Instructors and majors accounted for a significant proportion of students’ academic success, and served as key indicators of retention and graduation rates. They are embedded within the processes of university recruitment and competition for the best students."

Previous studies have shown that the use of small molecule drugs could be an efficient method to increase the efficacy of delivery of oligonucleotides by cell-penetrating peptides either as targeting agents that can be used in formulation with the cell-penetrating peptide and its cargo or as cell signaling modulators that facilitates the cellular uptake of the treatment. This study presents two aims. The first aim is the identification of small molecule drugs that would induce a synergic effect on the transfection of splice correcting oligonucleotides assisted by PepFect14. The second aim is to identify the mechanisms behind the effect of small molecule drugs modulation of cell-penetrating peptide assisted transfection of oligonucleotides. Through an optimized, high-throughput luciferase assay for short oligonucleotide delivery using cell-penetrating peptides, and the simultaneous addition of a small molecule drug library, we show that three small molecule drugs (MPEP, VU0357121 and Ciproxifan) induced an increase in the transfection efficacy of PepFect14 in complex with a short single-stranded oligonucleotide in HeLa pLuc705 cells. These three drugs are described in the literature to be highly specific for their respective target receptors. However, none of those receptors are expressed in our cell line, indicating a yet non-described pathway of action for these small molecules. We show that the indicated small molecules, without interfering with the particles formed by PepFect14 and the oligonucleotide, interfere via still unidentified interactions in cell signaling, leading to an up-regulation of endocytosis and a higher efficacy in the delivery of short splice correcting oligonucleotides in complex with PepFect14."

Given well documented challenges faced by pregnant women living with HIV taking lifetime ART, it is critical to understand the impact of short-term ART exposure followed by treatment interruption on maternal health outcomes.


Methods 
HIV+ breastfeeding (BF) and Formula Feeding (FF) women with CD4 counts > 350 cells/mm3, enrolled in the 1077BF/1077FF PROMISE trial were followed to assess the effect of ART during pregnancy and breastfeeding respectively. The first analysis compared ART use limited to the antepartum period (AP-only) relative to women randomized to Zidovudine. The second analysis included women with no pregnancy combination ART exposure; and compared women randomized to either ART or no ART during postpartum (PP-only). Both analyses included follow-up time beyond breastfeeding period. The primary outcome was progression to AIDS and/or death. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and HIV-related events.


Results 
3490 and 1137 HIV+ women were enrolled from 14 sites in Africa and India from April 2011 through September 2014 in cohort AP-only and PP-only, respectively. Most were Black African (96%); median age was 27 years; 97% were WHO Clinical Stage I; and most had a screening CD4 count ≥500 cells/mm3 (78%). The rate of progression to AIDS and/or death was similar and low across all comparison arms (AP comparison, HR = 1.14, 95%CI (0.44, 2.96), p-value = 0.79). In the PP-only cohort, the rate of WHO stage 2–3 events was lower for women randomized to ART(HR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.42, 1.01, p-value = 0.05).


Conclusion 
The incidence of AIDS and/or death was low in pregnant/postpartum HIV+ women with highCD4 cell counts for all comparison arms. This provides some reassurance that there were limited consequences for short term ART interruption in this group of asymptomatic HIV+ women during up to 4 years of follow up; and underscores that even short term ART exposure postpartum may reduce the risk of WHO grade 2–3 disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W3004396643,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among HIV-positive patients. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of including lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) in TB diagnostic algorithms for severely ill or immunosuppressed HIV-positive patients with symptoms of TB in Kenya. Methods From a decision-analysis tree, ten diagnostic algorithms were elaborated and compared. All algorithms included clinical exam. The costs of each algorithm were calculated using a ‘micro-costing’ method. The efficacy was estimated through a prospective study that included severely ill or immunosuppressed (CD4<200cells/μL) HIV-positive adults with symptoms of TB. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted as effectiveness outcome. A 4% discount rate was applied. Results The algorithm that added LF-LAM alone to the clinical exam lead to the least average cost per TB case detected (€47) and was the most cost-effective with a cost/DALY averted of €4.6. The algorithms including LF-LAM, microscopy and X-ray, and LF-LAM and Xpert in sputum, detected a high number of TB cases with a cost/DALY averted of €6.1 for each of them. In the comparisons of the algorithms two by two, using LF-LAM instead of microscopy (clinic&LAM vs clinic&microscopy) and using LF-LAM along with GeneXpert in sputum instead of GeneXpert in urine along with GeneXpert in sputum, (clinic&LAM&Xpert_sputum vs clinic&Xpert_sputum&Xpert_urine) led to the highest increase in the cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): €-7.2 and €-12.6 respectively. In these two comparisons, using LF-LAM increased the number of TB patients detected while reducing costs. Adding LF-LAM to smear microscopy alone or to smear microscopy and Xray led to the highest increase in the additional number of TB cases detected (31 and 25 respectively) with an incremental efficiency estimated at 134 and 344 DALYs respectively. The ICERs were €22.0 and €8.6 respectively. Conclusion Including LF-LAM in TB diagnostic algorithms is cost-effective for severely ill or immunosuppressed HIV-positive patients."

We investigated whether GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletion was associated with DTC risk and explored interaction with non-genetic risk factors of DTC.The study included 661 DTC cases and 736 controls from two case-control studies conducted in France and New Caledonia. Odds ratios (OR) and their confidence interval (CI) for DTC associated with GST genotypes, alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, body mass index and hormonal factors were calculated using logistic regression models.Results are presented for Europeans and Melanesians combined, as no heterogeneity between groups was detected. We found that DTC risk increased with obesity and decrease with alcohol drinking. After stratification by gene deletion status, the OR for obesity was 5.75, (95%CI 2.25-14.7) among individuals with GSTT1 and GSTM1-deleted genotype, and 1.26, (95%CI 0.89-1.77) in carriers of both genes (p-interaction = 0.02). The OR for drinking ≥1 glass/week was 0.33 (95%CI 0.15-0.74) in GSTT1-null individuals while it was 1.01 (95%CI 0.67-1.52) in non-null carriers of the gene (p-interaction = 0.01). No interaction between GST genotypes and other non-genetic risk factors was detected.GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes may modulate the DTC risk associated with BMI and alcohol consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3003587853,"Across the world, certain schools struggle to recruit and retain qualified teachers. This study explores teacher mobility across schools in rural China. Using a dataset from the Gansu Survey of Children and Families, this study investigates how teacher’s initial job placement relates to teacher mobility across schools. The findings show that non-local teachers whose initial placements were not in their hometowns were more likely to switch schools. Non-local teachers were also more likely to move for family reasons, compared to moving for personal development or due to involuntary transfer by the local government. The findings suggest that localized recruitment and deployment of teachers can be valuable for reducing teacher mobility rate and retaining teachers in hard-to-staff areas."
https://openalex.org/W3004383186,"To solve the issues and difficulties in the high-coupling modelling of beam pumping units and high-slip motors, external characteristic experiments of high-slip motors were performed where the external database and characteristic correlation equations of the motors were obtained through data regression analysis. Based on the analysis of the kinematics, dynamics and driving characteristics of the beam pumping unit, a fully coupled mathematical model of a motor, pumping unit, sucker rod and oil pump was established. The differential pumping equation system of the pumping unit used a cyclic iteration method to solve the problem of high coupling among the motor, pumping unit, sucker rod and the pumping pump. The model was verified by experimental data of field l pumping wells. Theoretical calculations and experimental tests showed that the soft characteristic of the high-slip motor can reduce the peak suspension load of the sucker rod, peak net torque of the gearbox and peak power of the motor. In addition, the results show that the soft characteristic can also decrease the high-frequency fluctuation of the motor power curve and the torque curve of the gearbox. The high-slip motor can improve the smoothness and safety of the pumping well system."
