https://openalex.org/W2108198510,"Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis and have recently been shown to modulate autophagy. The tumor suppressor Beclin 1 has been proposed to coordinate both apoptosis and autophagy through direct interaction with anti-apoptotic family members Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-XL. However, the molecular basis for this interaction remains enigmatic. Here we report that Beclin 1 contains a conserved BH3 domain, which is both necessary and sufficient for its interaction with Bcl-XL. We also report the crystal structure of a Beclin BH3 peptide in complex with Bcl-XL at 2.5Å resolution. Reminiscent of previously determined Bcl-XL-BH3 structures, the amphipathic BH3 helix of Beclin 1 bound to a conserved hydrophobic groove of Bcl-XL. These results define Beclin 1 as a novel BH3-only protein, implying that Beclin 1 may have a direct role in initiating apoptotic signaling. We propose that this putative apoptotic function may be linked to the ability of Beclin 1 to suppress tumor formation in mammals.

Insect Physiol. 1965; 11: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) is a critical process in metazoans responsible for basic tissue homeostasis, selective elimination of damaged cells, and structural reorganization during development. Apoptosis, the most clearly defined form of programmed cell death, is initiated by an array of intracellular and extracellular signals (e.g. DNA damage, cytokine removal, anoikis, etc.) and is characterized by a canonical morphology exhibiting chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and membrane blebbing (2Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar, 3Wyllie A.H. J. Clin. Pathol. Suppl. (R Coll Pathol). 1974; 7: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for this morphology involve the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria, and the subsequent activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that dismantle the cell in a precise and systematic manner (4Yuan J.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins integrate apoptotic signal transduction upstream of and at the mitochondrial membrane (7Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 8Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Three classes of Bcl-2 family proteins have been extensively described in the literature: anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, and Mcl-1, A1) containing three or four Bcl-2 homology (BH) 2The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; Bcl-2BD, Beclin 1 Bcl-2 binding domain; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Rh, hydrodynamic radius; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. domains; pro-apoptotic Bax-like proteins (Bax, Bak, and Bok) containing BH1, -2, and -3 domains; and pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g. Bim, Bad, Bid, PUMA, and Noxa) containing only the BH3 domain. Upon receipt of an apoptotic stimulus, BH3-only proteins are then “activated,” repress anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and activate pro-apoptotic Bax-like proteins via direct protein-protein interaction (9Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 10Fletcher J.I. Huang D.C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Labi V. Erlacher M. Kiessling S. Villunger A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1325-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This leads to oligomerization of Bax and Bak at the mitochondrial membrane, release of cytochrome c, and subsequent activation of caspases. Thus, BH3-only proteins form a family of critical cell death ligands, which initiate a canonical death pathway and the resultant apoptotic morphology. Autophagy, a highly conserved stress response, may function as an alternative, non-apoptotic death mechanism under certain conditions, for which it is sometimes referred to as type II programmed cell death (12Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 14Gozuacik D. Kimchi A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2891-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Under most conditions, autophagy is thought to function as a catabolic recycling mechanism involving the sequestration of cytoplasm and/or entire organelles into double-membraned vacuoles, termed autophagosomes, and their subsequent delivery to the lytic compartment (15Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). This type of autophagy, termed macroautophagy, functions to facilitate bioenergetic buffering during metabolic stress and turnover of long-lived proteins and organelles (15Levine B. Klionsky D.J. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). During nutrient limitation, autophagy serves as a survival mechanism, maintaining a reserve of macromolecular building blocks and ATP in both wild-type (16Lum J.J. Bauer D.E. Kong M. Harris M.H. Li C. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 2005; 120: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar) and transformed (17Degenhardt K. Mathew R. Beaudoin B. Bray K.

White E. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) cells. Interestingly, abnormal induction of autophagic vacuoles, a signature of type II programmed cell death, has been observed in dying cells from many diverse species (12Baehrecke E.H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 940-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 19Clarke P.G. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 195-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), which has led some to believe that autophagy may have a direct role in such a death process. Consistent with this hypothesis, molecular evidence for autophagy-dependent cell death has recently been observed in mouse L929 cells treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (20Yu L. Alva A. Su H. Dutt P. Freundt E. Welsh S. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2004; 304: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) and apoptosis-deficient bax-/-, bak-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with etoposide or staurosporine (21Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). In both cases, RNA interference directed toward components of the general autophagy machinery reverses the death phenotype. These studies bolster the notion that autophagy, an intrinsically self-limiting process, can, at least in some situations, act as a bona fide cell death program. Additionally, Bcl-2 itself has been shown to directly inhibit autophagic cell death via interaction with the mammalian autophagy gene beclin 1, demonstrating functional cross-talk between the apoptotic and autophagic pathways (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Beclin 1, the first identified mammalian autophagy protein (23Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar), can function as a tumor suppressor in mammals (24Aita V.M. Liang X.H. Murty V.V. Pincus D.L. Yu W. Cayanis E. Kalachikov S.

Cell Res. 2005; 307: 26-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A litany of human cell lines, each expressing a mutant Beclin 1 deficient in binding to Bcl-2, all display increased levels of type II cell death, which is suppressed by small interfering RNA of the essential autophagy gene atg5 (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Bcl-2, in addition to its hallmark ability to block type I-programmed cell death, can also block type II-programmed cell death, perhaps multiplying its oncogenic potential (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 29Pattingre S. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2885-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). They also imply that anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, acting upstream of Beclin 1, may serve as master cell death regulators, able to coordinate both apoptotic and autophagic signals. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of autophagy by Bcl-2 family proteins remain poorly understood. For example, it is unclear how Beclin 1 interacts with Bcl-XL or Bcl-2. Such lack of mechanistic understanding is further confounded by unpredictable cell biology observations. For example, overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with etoposide appears to stimulate, rather than inhibit, Beclin 1-dependent autophagic cell death (21Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). The cause of this reversal of phenotype in the presence of an apoptotic stimulus remains unclear (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the regulation of Beclin 1 by Bcl-2 family proteins, we have performed biochemical experiments using purified proteins. In this study, we have defined the minimal interaction domains between Bcl-XL and Beclin 1. We have discovered that Beclin 1 contains a conserved BH3 domain and determined the crystal structure of the Beclin 1 BH3 peptide in complex with Bcl-XL. The structure, combined with in vitro binding analysis, reveals that the Beclin 1 BH3 domain is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-XL and proves that Beclin 1 is an authentic BH3-only protein. The classification of Beclin 1 as a BH3-only family member implies that, at least under certain circumstances, Beclin 1 may act upstream of Bcl-2, mediating a cryptic apoptotic signaling function. We speculate that this putative pro-apoptotic function may partially explain the ability of Beclin 1 to suppress tumor formation in mammals. Expression and Purification of Proteins—The Beclin 1 cDNA was generously provided by Dr. Dan Klionsky (University of Michigan). All constructs were generated using a standard PCR-based cloning strategy and confirmed by sequencing. The Bcl-2 binding domain of human Beclin 1 (Bcl-2BD, residues 86-158) as well the human Beclin 1 BH3 domain (BeclinBH3, residues 107-135) were expressed as N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions from the vector pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Corporation). Human Bcl-XLΔloopΔTM (deletion of residues 27-82 and the C-terminal 24 residues) was cloned into pRSF (Novagen) and coexpressed with GST-BeclinBH3 in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) at 15 °C. The soluble fraction of the E. coli lysate was passed over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) affinity column, and the BeclinBH3-Bcl-XL complex was cleaved from the column using thrombin. The complex was then further purified using ion exchange (Source 15Q, Amersham Biosciences) and size exclusion (Superdex-200, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. Wild-type and mutant GST-Bcl-2BD were expressed individually at room temperature and purified using a similar purification procedure, except that intact GST fusions were eluted from the affinity resin using reduced glutathione. A variant of Bcl-XLΔTM (N52D,N66D) was expressed as a C-terminal His6 fusion from pET29b (Novagen) and purified to homogeneity using affinity (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen), ion exchange (Source 15Q), and size exclusion (Superdex-200) chromatography. Crystallization and Data Collection—BeclinBH3-Bcl-XL co-crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 22 °C by mixing equal volumes of protein (5 mg/ml) with a well buffer containing 19-24% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m tri-sodium citrate dihydrate. Crystals appeared overnight and were harvested after 10 days of maturation. The crystals belong to the space group P21212 and contain two domain-swapped dimers (four complexes) per asymmetric unit. The unit cell dimensions are a = 107.94 Å, b = 110.59 Å, and c = 100.52 Å. Crystals were equilibrated in a cryoprotectant buffer containing 15% glycerol (v/v) plus well buffer and flash frozen in a -170 °C nitrogen stream. Native data were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X-25 and processed using Denzo and Scalepack software (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structural Determination—The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the program PHASER (31McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) and coordinates from the Bim-Bcl-XL crystal structure (accession code 1PQ1), excluding the Bim peptide. The atomic model was built using O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and refined using crystallography NMR software (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Weak non-crystallography symmetry restraints (5-15 kcal/mol) were used in refinement. Electron density for the Beclin 1 peptide and the domain-swapped helices were unambiguous after preliminary refinement. The final, refined atomic model contains residues 107-127 of human Beclin 1 and residues 2-198 of human Bcl-XL with amino acids 26 and 83 contiguous. The Beclin 1 peptide contains two additional N-terminal residues (Gly and Ser) carried over from the thrombin cleavage site of pGEX-2T. GST-mediated Pulldown Assay—1 mg of wild-type or mutant GST-Bcl-2BD protein was immobilized on a 0.3-ml glutathione S-Sepharose 4B column and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol) to remove unbound protein. 2 mg of Bcl-XLΔTM was then bound to the resin followed by two 10-column volume washes with buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer A plus 5 mm reduced glutathione, applied to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Wild-type or mutant Bcl-2BD or a synthetic peptide identical to the BeclinBH3 peptide used for crystallization was titrated into the reaction cell of a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal) containing 20 μm Bcl-XLΔTM. The sequence of the synthetic peptide is NH2-GTMENLSRRLKVTGDLFDIMSGQTDVDHPCOOH. Thermodynamic constants were determined by least squares fitting using Origin version 7.0 software (Origen Laboratories). For all analyses, n was forced to equal 1, and the initial ligand concentration (Bcl-2BD) was varied until a best fit was achieved. This operation was necessary, because the initial concentration of Bcl-2BD could not be determined spectroscopically due to a lack of UV light-absorbing amino acids (Trp or Tyr). Bcl-XL concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Dynamic Light-scattering and Gel Filtration Analysis—Dynamic light-scattering data were collected on a Wyatt Technologies MiniDAWN instrument at 23 °C. All samples were diluted to 2 mg/ml in buffer A and passed through a 0.1-μm filter to remove particulate matter. Analytical gel filtration was performed using a Superdex-200 size exclusion column. For interaction assays between Bcl-XLΔTM and Beclin Bcl-2BD, proteins were mixed at a 2:1 molar ratio, respectively, and injected onto a Superdex-200 size exclusion column equilibrated with buffer A. The elution profile of Bcl-XLΔTM was monitored at 280 nm. In control experiments, the elution profile of wild-type and mutant Beclin Bcl-2BD proteins were determined by monitoring phenylalanine at 254 nm. Beclin 1 Contains a Conserved BH3 Domain—Previous studies have identified amino acids 88-150 of Beclin 1 as the minimal Bcl-2 binding domain (Bcl-2BD) (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 27Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2BD was shown to be necessary and sufficient for interaction with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL both in vivo and in vitro (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 27Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B.

The only surface on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins known to mediate protein-protein interactions is a conserved hydrophobic groove responsible for binding the BH3 helix of BH3-only proteins (34Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W.

By performing primary sequence alignments between an array of BH3 domains from known Bcl-2 family members and Bcl-2BD, we were able to identify a putative BH3 domain near the N terminus of Beclin 1 just prior to the coiled coil domain (Fig. 1). The Beclin 1 BH3 (BeclinBH3) domain shows a high degree of conservation at amino acids previously shown to be buried in the hydrophobic groove of Bcl-XL in the Bak (34Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar), Bad (35Petros A.M. Nettesheim D.G. Wang Y. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Mack J. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Zhang H. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2528-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and Bim (36Liu X. Dai S. Zhu Y. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. Immunity. 2003; 19: 341-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) peptide structures. These amino acids include Leu-112, Leu-116, Thr-119, Gly-120, and Phe-123 in human Beclin 1 (Fig. 1B). The BeclinBH3 domain also contains a signature glycine-aspartate dyad (Gly-120 and Asp-121), the aspartate of which forms a pair of conserved hydrogen bonds with Arg-139 lining the Bcl-XL groove. Using a similar strategy, we searched for homology to other Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1, BH2, and BH3) but were unable to identify any significant similarity to such sequences. The presence of a BH3 domain, and only a BH3 domain, defines Beclin 1 as a novel member of the BH3-only family of proteins. Mutations in BeclinBH3 Helical Contacts Disrupt Binding to Bcl-XL—To show that the putative BeclinBH3 is required for the interaction with pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, several conserved BH3 residues (Leu-116, Thr-119, and Gly-120) were individually mutated to glutamate, and the resulting mutant proteins were assayed for their ability to bind to Bcl-XL. Because of the poor solubility of full-length Beclin 1, Bcl-2BD was used for these experiments. Two assays, GST-mediated pulldown (Fig. 2A) and analytical gel filtration (Fig. 2B), consistently demonstrated that the missense mutations L116E or G120E led to abrogation of the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-XL. A double mutant containing both the L116E and G120E mutations similarly lost binding to Bcl-XL. In contrast, the mutant T119E appeared to retain some binding to Bcl-XL in both assays. Next, we determined the binding affinities using ITC, in which various Beclin 1 mutants (Bcl-2BD) were titrated into a sample chamber containing Bcl-XL protein. This analysis revealed an apparent binding affinity of 2.3 μm between wild-type Beclin 1 and Bcl-XL (Fig. 2C, left panel). A similar binding affinity, 1.1 μm, was attained using a synthetic BeclinBH3 peptide (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the extra sequences flanking the BH3 domain in Bcl-2BD do not make any significant contribution to Bcl-XL binding. Consistent with the pulldown and gel filtration assays, no interaction with Bcl-XL was observed for the mutant Beclin 1 Bcl-2BD-L116E (Fig. 2C, middle panel). Furthermore, in agreement with the observation that the Beclin 1 mutant T119E retained some binding to Bcl-XL in the pull-down and gel filtration assays (Fig. 2, A and B), T119E exhibited a decreased binding affinity (14.8 μm) for Bcl-XL by ITC (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results demonstrate that the BeclinBH3 domain itself is specifically required for the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-XL in vitro. They also demonstrate that the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 can form a “stable” complex with Bcl-XL. A Beclin missense mutant, F123A in human Beclin 1, has recently been shown to disrupt binding to Bcl-2 in vivo (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). This mutation serendipitously maps to the C terminus of the BH3 helix in Beclin 1 (Fig. 1B). Yeast two-hybrid analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells suggest that this mutation disrupts the interaction between Beclin 1 and cellular Bcl-2 (22Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Based on the Bim and Bad peptide structures, the benzene ring of this phenylalanine makes critical van der Waals contacts with amino acids in the conserved groove of Bcl-XL. These contacts are predicted to be significantly weakened or disrupted by mutation of Phe to the much smaller Ala. These results are consistent with our in vitro observations and suggest that the BeclinBH3 domain is responsible for interaction with Bcl-2 family proteins in vivo in the context of a fulllength protein. Thus, the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 is the minimal element necessary for interaction with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins both in vitro and in vivo. Overall Structure of the Bcl-XL-BeclinBH3 Heterodimer—BH3 domains may have been misidentified in a number of proteins (37Aouacheria A. Brunet F. Gouy M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 2395-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) presumably because of the low complexity of the consensus sequence. This prompted us to examine the interaction between the BeclinBH3 domain and Bcl-XL in more detail. Accordingly, we co-crystallized a heterodimeric complex containing a BeclinBH3 peptide (hBeclin-(107-135)) and a deletion variant of Bcl-XL (Bcl-XLΔloopΔTM; see “Experimental Procedures”). The structure was determined at a 2.5 Å resolution by molecular replacement using the Bcl-XL-Bim structure (Table 1).TABLE 1Statistics from crystallographic analysisDataProteinBcl-XL-BeclinBH3 complexBeamlineNSLS-X25Space groupP21212Resolution (outer shell) (Å)50.0-2.4 (2.49-2.40)Total observations186,833Unique observations46,829Data coverage (outer shell)97.7% (98.8%)I/σ (outer shell)10.6 (2.34)Rsym (outer shell)0.071 (0.413)RefinementResolution range (Å)50.0-2.5Number of reflections (|F| > 0)41,260Data coverage (test set)97.6% (5%)Rworking0.226Rfree0.263Total number of atoms5,312Number of waters16Root mean square deviation bond length (Å)0.010Root mean square deviation bond angles (degree)1.36Ramachandran PlotMost favored (%)92.9Additionally allowed (%)6.3Generously allowed (%)0.9Disallowed (%)0 Open table in a new tab Unexpectedly, the heterodimer crystallized as a domainswapped tetramer, with each Bcl-XL monomer bound to an independent BeclinBH3 peptide and each Bcl-XL helix α1 intermolecularly “swapped” with its neighbor (Fig. 3A). Two lines of experimental evidence suggest that this domain swap was induced during crystallization, likely as a result of a crystallization artifact. First, dynamic light-scattering experiments revealed that the BeclinBH3-Bcl-XL complex reproducibly displayed a virtually identical hydrodynamic radius (Rh), 3.1 ± 0.2 nm, as unbound Bcl-XL in solution. Second, both the complex and unbound Bcl-XL showed identical elution volumes by analytical gel filtration, suggesting similar apparent molecular weights (data not shown). Bcl-XLΔTM is monomeric in solution on the basis of reported NMR structure and analytical ultracentrifugation analysis (38Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S.

Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, by extension, the virtually identical solution properties we observed between the BeclinBH3 complex and Bcl-XLΔTM indicates that the complex exists as a single heterodimer in solution, which only becomes domain-swapped during crystallization. It is important to note that the domain swap in Bcl-XL does not impact in any way the interactions between the BeclinBH3 peptide and Bcl-XL (Fig. 3A) and thus does not compromise the understanding of the molecular recognition between BeclinBH3 peptide and Bcl-XL. Irrespective of the domain swapping, each dimeric unit aligns extremely well with the Bcl-XL-Bim structure, with a root mean square deviation of 0.531 Å over 584 backbone atoms (Fig. 3B). Helix α1 swapped into the exact position and orientation as it is normally found in the crystal structures of the BimBH3-Bcl-XL complex (root mean square deviation of 0.339 Å over 140 backbone atoms in helix α1) and Bcl-XL (root mean square deviation of 0.520 Å over 136 atoms in helix α1"

Inflammatory cytokines and non-laminar blood flow induce endothelial dysfunction and confer a pro-adhesive and pro-thrombotic phenotype. Therefore, identification of factors that mediate the effects of these stimuli on endothelial function is of considerable interest. Kruppel-like factor 4 expression has been documented in endothelial cells, but a function has not been described. In this communication we describe the expression in vitro and in vivo of Kruppel-like factor 4 in human and mouse endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endothelial Kruppel-like factor 4 is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and shear stress. Overexpression of Kruppel-like factor 4 induces expression of multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic factors including endothelial nitric-oxide synthase and thrombomodulin, whereas knockdown of Kruppellike factor 4 leads to enhancement of tumor necrosis factor α-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and tissue factor expression. The functional importance of Kruppel-like factor 4 is verified by demonstrating that Kruppel-like factor 4 expression markedly decreases inflammatory cell adhesion to the endothelial surface and prolongs clotting time under inflammatory states. Kruppel-like factor 4 differentially regulates the promoter activity of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in a manner consistent with its anti-inflammatory function. These data implicate Kruppel-like factor 4 as a novel regulator of endothelial activation in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.

The net effect of NF-κB activation is the disruption of the non-inflammatory, non-thrombogenic endothelial surface.

Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are a subclass of the zinc-finger family of transcription factors characterized by the DNA binding domain containing the conserved sequence CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H(X is any amino acid; underlined cysteine and histidine residues coordinate zinc) (17Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The zinc fingers are usually found at the C terminus of the protein and bind to the consensus sequence 5′-CNCCC-3′. The N terminus is involved in transcriptional activation and repression as well as protein-protein interaction (17Bieker J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrate that KLF proteins typically regulate critical aspects of cellular differentiation and tissue development. For example, KLF1 (EKLF, erythroid Kruppel-like factor) has been shown by gene targeting experiments to be essential for red blood cell maturation (18Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H.

In this work we demonstrate for the first time that KLF4 regulates critical aspects of endothelial cell inflammatory and thrombotic function. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human aortic endothelial cells were acquired from Cambrex Bioscience and cultured in endothelial cell basal medium-2 media according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bovine aortic endothelial cells were from Cell Applications and were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. COS7 were from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in the same medium as bovine aortic endothelial cells. THP-1 cells were from American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Where indicated, HUVECs were treated with human IL1-β, human TNFα (R&D systems), interferon γ (Pierce), and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) at final concentrations of 2.5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 0.1 ng/ml, and 100 ng/ml, respectively, for 4 h. Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemistry—C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized, and tissues were harvested, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, and imbedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were cut. Immunohistochemical analysis of formalin-fixed tissues from mice was performed with standard procedures in the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Histopathology Core using a polyclonal antibody against KLF4 (Santa Cruz, sc-12538). Human tissue was obtained from cardiac transplantation donors under protocols approved by the Human Investigation Review Committee at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (IRB 1999-P-001348). This tissue was frozen, fixed with acetone, and stained with an anti-KLF4 antibody as previously described (40Katz J.P. Perreault N. Goldstein B.G. Actman L. McNally S.R. Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Kaestner K.H. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 935-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), except that a 1:5000 dilution of the antibody was used. Adjacent sections were stained with nonimmune IgG as a negative control. RNA Extraction and RNA Blot Analysis—HUVECs were infected with adenovirus expressing green fluorescence protein (Ad-GFP) or adenovirus expressing (via a bicistronic promoter) both GFP and KLF4 (Ad-K4) for 48 h, exposed to the indicated stimulus, and then harvested for total RNA analysis. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells with Trizol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Human lung messenger RNA (mRNA) was purchased from Stratagene. RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled, random-primed cDNA probes, washed, and exposed as described previously (41Feinberg M.W. Jain M.K. Werner F. Sibinga N.E. Wiesel P. Wang H. Topper J.N.

TM, tissue plasminogen activator, VCAM-1, TF, and KLF4 cDNA were generated by reverse transcription-PCR. eNOS cDNA was a kind gift from Dr. J. K. Liao (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Quantitative PCR—Total RNA (2-5 μg) was reverse-transcribed using 1× reverse transcriptase buffer, MgCl2 (2.2 mm), dNTP (2.0 mm), RNasin (0.2 units/μl), and oligo-dT primers (0.5 mm)in20-μl reactions. Reactions were incubated at 70 °C for 2 min and put on ice. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (0.3 units/μl) was then added, and cDNA was prepared using a 2-step cycle, 48 °C for 1 h and 94 °C for 5 min. Reverse transcription reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The resulting cDNA was diluted to 100 μl and used in subsequent real time PCR reactions. Real time fluorescence detection was carried out using a Stratagene Mx3005P real-time PCR system. Reactions were carried out in micro 96-well reaction plates using 18 μl of Brilliant Sybr Green Master Mix (Stratagene), forward and reverse primers (0.2 μm each, Invitrogen), and cDNA (2 μl) in a final PCR reaction volume of 20 μl. Amplification parameters were denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 62 °C for 60 s (except for TM where extension temperature was 57 °C). Samples were analyzed in duplicate, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an endogenous control. -Fold induction was calculated after normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using the MX3005P software. Dissociation curves indicated that a single amplification product was made in each reaction. Amplification products using Syber green detection were initially checked by electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. The estimated size of the amplified products matched the calculated size for transcript by visual inspection.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. For Western analysis for KLF4-knockdown studies, 150 μg of total cell protein was loaded per lane. Adenoviral and Retroviral Infections—Adenoviral constructs for KLF4 or the “empty virus” control both encode GFP and were generated by the Harvard Gene Therapy Group. The GFP and KLF4 are expressed as separate proteins driven by a bidirectional cytomegalovirus promoter. For adenoviral infection of HUVECs, cells were seeded at 2 × 106/10-cm2 dish, infected with the adenoviral vectors at 15-20 multiplicity of infection, and incubated for 48 h. Transduction efficiencies were typically >85% as measured by GFP positivity and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. For retroviral small interfering RNA studies, the sequence GGACGGCTGTGGATGGAAA (32Rowland B.D. Bernards R. Peeper D.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) was cloned into the retroviral vector pSUPER.retro (oligo engine), and retroviruses containing the small interfering RNA hairpin and a puromycin resistance gene were generated using the Phoenix packaging cells according to Dr. Nolan’s online protocol. For retroviral infection of target cells, retroviral supernatant and culture medium (10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium plus 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Specialty Media)) were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and added to pre-confluent cells. Infected cells were selected with 3 μg/ml puromycin. A negative control oligonucleotide (gift from B. Spiegelman) was processed in a similar manner. Laminar Shear Stress Experiments—HUVECs were seeded onto the inner surface of sterilized fibronectin-coated gaspermeable Silastic laboratory tubes by axially rotating the tubes at 10 rotations per hour at 37 °C for 24 h as previously described (46Balcells M. Fernandez Suarez M. Vazquez M. Edelman E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Closed loops of tubing were created using the section with the confluent HUVEC monolayer and placed in a perfusion bioreactor at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were exposed to static conditions or shear stress of 2, 5, or 20 dynes/cm2 for 24 h before harvest by trypsinization (46Balcells M. Fernandez Suarez M. Vazquez M. Edelman E.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 204: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Precipitated cells were resuspended in Trizol for total RNA isolation as described above. cDNA was prepared from RNA using standard techniques. Multiplex Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—HUVECs were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-K4 for 48 h and treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 5 h, and supernatants were collected for analysis of secreted factors. Analysis was performed with the SearchLight Proteome Arrays multiplex sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pierce). Each sample was evaluated in duplicate from three independent experiments. Thrombomodulin and Tissue Factor Activity Assays—TM (luminal surface) activity was measured in HUVECs infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-K4 using a chromogenic assay (47Cadroy Y. Diquelou A. Dupouy D.

Cell Res. 1998; 238: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Endothelial TM enzymatic activity was measured by the production of activated protein C from protein C. Briefly, HUVECs were washed with cold TBS (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 120 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.7 mmol/liter KCl, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) three times and then immediately incubated with 150 nmol/liter human protein C (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and 0.5 units/ml thrombin for 1 h at 37°C. The reactions were quenched by adding hirudin (Sigma-Aldrich), and activated protein C activity was measured using a chromogenic substrate (S2366, Chromogenix). The reaction was stopped after 10 min by the addition of acetic acid, and the amidolytic activity of activated protein C generated was read at 405 nm with a spectrophotometer. The TM activity was expressed in arbitrary units using reference curves determined with purified human activated protein C (Enzyme Research Laboratories). For TF activity assays, uninfected and Ad-GFP- and Ad-K4-infected HUVECs were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml of TNFα for an additional 5 h. The cells were assayed for total cell-associated TF activity per the manufacturer’s instructions using the Actichrome TF kit (American Diagnostica). eNOS Activity Assays—eNOS enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine to l-[3H]citrulline in labeled cells as described previously (49Greif D.M. Kou R. Michel T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15845-15853Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs were incubated in Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 109 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm glucose) for 1 h at 37 °C and then labeled with l-[3H]arginine (10Ci/ml) and stimulated with 1 m calcium ionophore A23187 for 10 min at 37 °C. Immediately thereafter, cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm l-arginine, scraped into 2 ml of stop buffer (20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 1 mm l-citrulline, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA), and sonicated. Aliquots of these lysates were withdrawn to determine total cellular protein abundance and 3H incorporation. l-[3H]Citrulline was isolated from the remaining lysate by anion exchange chromatography with AG 50W-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Clotting Assay—HUVEC were plated in 96-well dishes and infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-K4 for 48 h, then incubated for another 5 h in the absence or presence of TNFα. Cells were then rinsed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl of 37 °C human plasma (Sigma-Aldrich) added to each well. Immediately thereafter, 100 μl of 25 mm CaCl2 was added, and plates were placed in a Vmax kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices) and read at 405 nm every 20 s for 30 min (50Rose S.L. Babensee J.E. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. A. 2005; 72: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fibrin clot formation is indicated when a maximum absorbance is reached. Clotting times are reported at half-maximal absorbance. Adhesion Assays under Flow—HUVEC monolayers were grown to confluency on fibronectin-coated coverslips, infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-K4 for 48 h, then treated for a further 5 h in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml TNFα. A parallel plate laminar flow chamber (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA) was used to perfuse the monolayer with perfusion medium containing 106 cells/ml THP-1 at an estimated shear stress of 2.0 dynes/cm2 as described previously (51Gerszten R.E.

Monocyte adhesion (>3s) was quantified for three high-powered fields per coverslip. The entire period of perfusion was recorded on videotape. HUVEC Immunostaining—HUVEC monolayers (prepared in parallel with those used for adhesion assays) were released from coverslips with Hepes-buffered solution containing EDTA and EGTA. Staining for VCAM-1, E-selectin, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 was performed as described previously (52Gerszten R.E. Luscinskas F.W. Ding H.T. Dichek D.A. Stoolman L.M.

Transient Transfections—HUVECs, bovine aortic endothelial cells, or COS7 were plated at a density of 5 × 104/well in 12-well plates 1 day before transfection. Transient transfection studies were performed using FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA was used per well. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection at which time they were nearly confluent. In some experiments cells were treated with human TNFα (10 ng/ml) for"
https://openalex.org/W2150382231,"Background A large number of dry-preserved insect specimens exist in collections around the world that might be useful for genetic analyses. However, until now, the recovery of nucleic acids from such specimens has involved at least the partial destruction of the specimen. This is clearly undesirable when dealing with rare species or otherwise important specimens, such as type specimens. Methodology We describe a method for the extraction of PCR-amplifiable mitochondrial and nuclear DNA from dry insects without causing external morphological damage. Using PCR to amplify ≈220 bp of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I, and 250–345 bp fragments of the multi-copy, nuclear 28s ribosomal DNA gene, we demonstrate the efficacy of this method on beetles collected up to 50 years ago. Conclusions This method offers a means of obtaining useful genetic information from rare insects without conferring external morphological damage."

The neurotrophin couples synaptic activation to changes in gene expression underlying long term potentiation and short term plasticity. Here we show that BDNF acutely up-regulates GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunits in 7-day tropomyosin-related kinase in vitro cultured hippocampal neurons. The increase in GluR1 and GluR2 protein levels in developing cultures was impaired by K252a, a Trk inhibitor, and by translation (emetine and anisomycin) and transcription (α-amanitine and actinomycin D) inhibitors. Accordingly, BDNF increased the mRNA levels for GluR1 and GluR2 subunits. Biotinylation studies showed that stimulation with BDNF for 30 min selectively increased the amount of GluR1 associated with the plasma membrane, and this effect was abrogated by emetine. Under the same conditions, BDNF induced GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser-831 through activation of protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Chelation of endogenous extracellular BDNF with TrkB-IgG selectively decreased GluR1 protein levels in 14-day in vitro cultures of hippocampal neurons. Moreover, BDNF promoted synaptic delivery of homomeric GluR1 AMPA receptors in cultured organotypic slices, by a mechanism independent of NMDA receptor activation. Taken together, the results indicate that BDNF up-regulates the protein levels of AMPA receptor subunits in hippocampal neurons and induces the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse.

Neurotrophins are essential for the development of the vertebrate nervous system, modulate synaptic function, and play an important role in synaptic plasticity (1Poo M.M. Nat. Rev.

Accordingly, LTP is impaired in the hippocampal CA1 region of animals deficient in BDNF, but it can be rescued by supplying the neurotrophin (3Korte M. Carroll P. Wolf E. Brem G. Thoenen H.

Chelation of endogenous BDNF also prevents the induction of LTP by theta burst stimulation and reduces late phase LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (6Figurov A. Pozzo-Miller L.D. Olafsson P. Wang T. Lu B. Nature. 1996; 381: 706-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 7Kang H. Welcher A.A. Shelton D. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the late phase LTP induced by tetanic stimulation was not observed in slices from BDNF knock-out mice and was also abrogated when TrkB receptors were blocked (8Korte M. Kang H. Bonhoeffer T. Schuman E. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Taken together, the available evidences point to a direct role of BDNF in the early and late phases of LTP. Binding of BDNF to TrkB receptors is followed by activation of intracellular signaling pathways, including the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt, and Src pathways (9Narisawa-Saito M.

TrkB receptors are located on axon terminals and in the post-synaptic density of glutamatergic synapses (12Drake C.T. Milner T.A. Patterson S.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8009-8026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Aoki C. Wu K. Elste A. Len G. Lin S. McAuliffe G. Black I.B. J. Neurosci.

Res. 2006; 83: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but whether the effects of BDNF on synaptic plasticity are mediated by pre- and/or post-synaptic receptors is not fully elucidated. BDNF was originally shown to induce a long lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 region, acting at a presynaptic site (15Kang H. Schuman E.M. Science. 1995; 267: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) (for conflicting results see Refs. 4Patterson S.L. Abel T. Deuel T.A.S. Martin K.C. Rose J.C. Kandel E.R.

Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 3383-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and subsequent studies showed that BDNF was selectively required for those forms of LTP that recruit a presynaptic component (19Zakharenko S.S.

However, activation of post-synaptic TrkB receptors generates intracellular Ca2+ concentration transients in dentate granule cells, which induce LTP when paired with weak synaptic stimulation (20Kovalchuk Y. Hanse E. Kafitz K.W. Konnerth A. Science. 2002; 295: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The enhancement of synaptic transmission by BDNF observed in the dentate gyrus in vivo (21Messaoudi E. Bardsen K. Srebro B. Bramham C.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) may also be due, at least in part, to the activation of post-synaptic receptors (22Messaoudi E. Ying S.W. Kanhema T. Croll S.D. Bramham C.R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7453-7461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ying S.W. Futter M. Rosenblum K. Webber M.J. Hunt S.P. Bliss T.V. Bramham C.R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1532-1540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a post-synaptic role of BDNF in synaptic plasticity, and the potential mechanisms involved, remain controversial. The number, composition, and location of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in neurons, together with receptor phosphorylation, are critically important factors in determining the neuronal response to glutamate, and play an important role in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity (24Gomes A.R. Correia S.S. Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. Neurochem. Res. 2003; 28: 1459-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). AMPA receptors are formed by the association of GluR1-GluR4 subunits, and their delivery to the synapse is tightly controlled by the intracellular signaling activity. In this work, we characterized the effect of BDNF on the abundance of AMPA receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons and on their cellular distribution. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of BDNF on the synaptic delivery of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors in CA1 hippocampal neurons, which could account for the postsynaptic effects of the neurotrophin in the early phase of LTP. Hippocampal Cultures—Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were prepared from the hippocampi of E18–E19 Wistar rat embryos, after treatment with trypsin (0.06%, 15 min, and 37 °C, Invitrogen) and deoxyribonuclease I (5.36 mg/ml), in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (5.36 mm KCl, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 4.16 mm NaHCO3, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4·2H2O, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.001% phenol red). The hippocampi were then washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker), to stop trypsin activity, and transferred to Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 supplement (1:50 dilution, Invitrogen), 25 μm glutamate, 0.5 mm glutamine, and 0.12 mg/ml gentamycin. The cells were dissociated in this solution and were then plated in 6-well plates (91.6 × 103 cells/cm2), coated with poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). The cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2/95% air, at 37 °C, for 7 or 14 days. Cultures were stimulated with 100 ng/ml BDNF (kind gift from Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY) for the indicated periods of time. When appropriate, 200 nm K252a, 2.0 μm emetine, 2.0 μm anisomycin, 1.5 μm α-amanitine, 1.5 μm actinomycin D (Calbiochem), 5 μm chelerythrine (Sigma), or 10 μm KN-93 (Sigma) were added 30 min before stimulation, as indicated. Scavenging of endogenous extracellular BDNF was performed with TrkB-IgG (1 μg/ml, Sigma) for 24 h. Hippocampal slices were prepared from young rats (postnatal days 5 and 6) and cultured on semiporous membranes as previously described (25Gahwiler B.H. Capogna M. Debanne D. McKinney R.A. Thompson S.M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Preparation of Extracts—Hippocampal neurons were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once more with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS at a final pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, and the mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min, protein in the supernatants was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method, and the samples were diluted with a 2× concentrated denaturating buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm glycine, 4% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, 3 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Extracts from treated hippocampal slices were prepared in homogenization buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 μm microcystin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 1% Triton X-100). Samples were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 4 min, and the protein present in the supernatant was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method and denaturated with denaturating buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The proteins of interest were then analyzed by Western blot. Total RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription for Real-time PCR—Total RNA from cultured hippocampal neurons was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The full content of a 6-well cell cluster plate, with 870,000 cells/well (7 DIV), was collected for each experimental condition. For first strand cDNA synthesis, 3 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science) using random primer p(dN)6 (3.2 μg), dNTPs (1 mm each), MgCl2 (25 mm), RNase inhibitor (50 units) and gelatin (0.01 μg/μl) in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.3) in a total volume of 40 μl. The reaction was performed at 25 °C for 10 min, followed by 60 min at 42 °C, for primer annealing to the RNA template and cDNA synthesis, respectively. The reverse transcriptase was then denatured during 5 min at 99 °C, and the sample was cooled to 4 °C for 5 min and finally stored at -80 °C until further use. Real-time PCR—Real-Time PCR analysis of gene expression was performed using the LightCycler System II (Roche Applied Science). The PCR reactions were performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (26Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) in 20-μl capillaries. The primers used for amplification of genes encoding AMPA receptor subunits were, respectively, RGR1F2271, 5′-GAA CCA TCC GTG TTT GTT CG-3′ and RGR1R2937, 5′-TTC CTG TCT GCT CCA GTT AC-3′ for GluR1; RGR2F2522, 5′-GAA GCC TTG TGA CAC CAT GA-3′ and RGR2R3008, 5′-AGC CTT GCC TTG CTC CTC AT-3′ for GluR2; RGR3F2431, 5′-CAA AGG CTA TGG TGT GGC AA-3′ and RGR3R2927, 5′-ACA CCA GGG AGA GTG AAA TC-3′ for GluR3; S2288, 5′-TGG AGG GCG TGG CTC GTG TC-3′ and R2800, 5′-TTG GGG CAG TCA GGG GTA AG-3′ for GluR4. The primers used for the amplification of endogenous control gene 18 S rRNA were those included in the Applied Biosystems TaqMan Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents Kit (Porto, Portugal). Each primer of a pair was added to the reaction mixture (10 μl) at a final concentration of 0.8 μm with 3 mm MgCl2, in addition to the “Hot Start” LightCycler Fast Start DNA Master SYBR Green I mix (1×) and 1.2 μl of cDNA sample. Thermal cycling was initiated with activation of the FastStart TaqDNA polymerase by denaturation during 10 min at 95 °C followed by 45 cycles of a 30-s melting step at 95 °C, a 5-s annealing step at 58 °C, and a 25-s elongation step at 72 °C. All temperature transition rates used were at 20 °C/s. After amplification for 45 cycles, at least 10 cycles beyond the beginning of the linear phase of amplification, samples were subjected to a melting curve analysis according to the instructions of the manufacturer to confirm the absence of unspecific amplification products and primer-dimers. In all experiments, samples containing no template were included as negative controls. mRNA Quantitative Analysis—The mRNA levels of the constitutively expressed housekeeping gene encoding 18 S ribosomal RNA were used as a control, in all experiments. The relative changes in the mRNA levels of glutamate receptor subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons were determined using the ΔΔCp method. Accordingly, for each experimental condition (unstimulated neurons and neurons treated with 100 ng/ml BDNF for 30 min or 3 h) the “crossing point” (Cp) values given by the LightCycler system II software, for each target gene, were subtracted by the respective Cp value determined for the 18 S gene from the same sample and condition (ΔCp). This allows normalizing changes in target gene expression. Afterward, the ΔCp values were subtracted by the respective values of the control for the target gene giving ΔΔCp. The derivation to the value of 2-(ΔΔCp) sets each control at the unity (or 100%), because ΔΔCp (control) = 0, and the stimuli conditions used were at a percentage relative to the control. Surface Biotinylation and Precipitation—Hippocampal cell cultures were treated or not with 100 ng/ml BDNF and then incubated with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link™ Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, for 30 min (27Gomes A.R. Cunha P. Nuriya M. Faro C.J. Huganir R.L. Pires E.V. Carvalho A.L. Duarte C.B. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The non-bound biotin was removed by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm glycine. Cell lysates were obtained as described above and were incubated with UltraLink Plus™ immobilized streptavidin or UltraLink® immobilized NeutrAvidin™ plus beads (Pierce), for 2 h at 4 °C, under constant agitation. Non-biotinylated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 3 min, and the beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Biotinylated proteins were then eluted with denaturating buffer at 95 °C for 5 min (Fig. 7, A, C, and D) or at 65 °C for 15 min (Fig. 7B). Samples were then processed for Western blotting analysis. Western Blotting—Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, in 6% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene membranes (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies (overnight at 4 °C), washed, and exposed to alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:20,000 dilution; 1 h at room temperature). Alkaline phosphatase activity was visualized by enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF) on the Storm 860 Gel and Blot Imaging System (Amersham Biosciences) or by ECL (Fig. 9A). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-GluR1 (1:1,500, Upstate, Waltham, MA), anti-GluR2 (1:600, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), anti-GluR3 (1:200, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), anti-GluR4 (1:200, Chemicon International), anti-pGluR1 Ser-831 (1:1,000, Chemicon International or 1:1,500, Tocris, UK), anti-pGluR1 Ser-845 (1:1,000, Chemicon International), anti-pGluR2 Ser-880 (1:1,000, Chemicon International), anti-pTrk (1:1,000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and anti-TrkB (clone 47, 1:1,000, BD Biosciences). Anti-α-tubulin (1:1,000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-β-tubulin I (1:150,000, Sigma), anti-actin (1:20,000, Chemicon), and anti-transferrin receptor (1:3,000, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) antibodies were used as loading controls. Electrophysiology—After 3–5 days in culture, the organotypic cultures of rat hippocampal slices, prepared as previously described (25Gahwiler B.H. Capogna M. Debanne D. McKinney R.A. Thompson S.M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), were infected (36 h) with the Sindbis virus expressing recombinant GluR1 or GluR1 plus the constitutive active αCaMKII (as indicated), tagged to GFP. Voltage clamp whole cell recordings were obtained from infected and uninfected CA1 pyramidal neurons, under visual guidance using fluorescence and transmitted light illumination. The recording chamber was perfused with 119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 11 mm glucose, 0.1 mm picrotoxin, 0.1 mm dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), and 2 μm 2-chloroadenosine (pH 7.4), gassed with 5% CO2/95% O2. Patch recording pipettes (4–7 MΩ) were filled with the 115 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 0.4 mm Na3GTP, 10 mm sodium phosphocreatine, 0.6 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm spermine (pH 7.25). Whole cell recordings were carried out with a MultiClamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Synaptic responses were evoked with two bipolar electrodes with single voltage pulses (duration of 0.3 ms, up to 20 V). The stimulating electrodes were placed over Schaffer collateral fibers between 200 and 300 μm from the recorded cells. Synaptic AMPA receptor-mediated responses were collected at -60 mV and +40 mV with glass electrodes placed in CA1 stratum radiatum and averaged over 50–60 trials; their ratio was used as an index of rectification. All electrophysiological data were collected with pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). When the effect of K252a (200 nm) was tested, the drug was added to the perfusion medium 30 min prior to incubation with 100 ng/ml BDNF. Incubation with BDNF was performed from 30 min to 2.5 h. When the effect of NMDA receptor activity on AMPA delivery to the synapse was studied, NMDA receptor-mediated responses were blocked pharmacologically using 0.1 mm APV. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett test or Bonferroni test, or using the Student's t test, as indicated in the figure captions. Effect of BDNF on the Total Protein Levels of AMPA Receptor Subunits—To determine whether acute stimulation with BDNF affects the abundance of glutamate receptor subunits, 7 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons were incubated with or without 100 ng/ml BDNF, for various periods of time (15 min to 24 h). The AMPA receptor subunit (GluR1, GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4) protein levels were determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1). BDNF rapidly up-regulated GluR1-GluR3 protein levels, in a transient manner, with small effects observed already after 15 min of stimulation with the neurotrophin (Fig. 1, A, C, and E). In contrast, BDNF did not change GluR4 protein levels (Fig. 1F). The increases in GluR1, GluR2, and GluR3 had distinct kinetics, and the maximal effects were observed after incubation with BDNF for 1 h, 2 h, and 30 min, respectively. For longer periods of BDNF stimulation (12–24 h), the abundance of GluR1-GluR3 subunits decreased to values similar to the control. Because there was little GluR3 immunoreactivity with the antibody used, the effect of BDNF on this subunit was not further examined. In contrast with the results obtained using 7 DIV hippocampal neurons, BDNF did not affect GluR1 and GluR2 protein levels in neurons cultured for 14 DIV, for incubation periods with the neurotrophin of 2–24 h (Fig. 1, B and D). However, when the endogenous extracellular BDNF was chelated with the fusion protein TrkB-IgG for 24 h, the levels of GluR1 significantly decreased (Fig. 2A), whereas no changes were observed for the GluR2 subunit (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that endogenous BDNF regulates the GluR1 protein levels in 14 DIV cultures of hippocampal neurons. Activation of Trk neurotrophin receptors was required for up-regulation of GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits by BDNF in 7 DIV cultures, because no effect of the neurotrophin was observed when the experiments were conducted in the presence of K252a (200 nm), an inhibitor of this family of receptors (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Inhibition of Trk activity blocks the BDNF-induced up-regulation of GluR1 and GluR2 protein levels. Neurons (7 DIV) were incubated with or without 100 ng/ml BDNF for 2 h, in the presence or in the absence of K252a (200 nm). When the inhibitor was present it was preincubated 30 min before stimulation with BDNF. Total GluR1 and GluR2 protein levels were measured by Western blot. Control (unstimulated) protein levels of AMPA receptor subunits were set to 100%. Actin was used as loading control. The results are the average ± S.E. of 7–18 independent experiments, performed in independent preparations. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni test. ***, p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether the effect of BDNF was due to an increase in protein synthesis, we used two translation inhibitors, emetine and anisomycin. Hippocampal neurons were stimulated with BDNF for 3 h, in the presence or in the absence of the translation inhibitors. Emetine (2 μm) and anisomycin (2 μm) abrogated the effect of BDNF on GluR1 and GluR2 subunits (Fig. 4). None of the protein synthesis inhibitors reduced the GluR1 or GluR2 protein levels under control conditions, in agreement with the long half-life of AMPA receptor subunits (28O'Brien R.J. Kamboj S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Taken together, our findings indicate that the effect of BDNF on AMPA receptor subunits is mediated by activation of TrkB receptor and is due to an up-regulation of protein synthesis instead of a reduction in protein degradation. BDNF Up-regulates AMPA Receptor Subunits by Promoting Transcription Activity—BDNF may stimulate either transcription of genes (22Messaoudi E. Ying S.W. Kanhema T. Croll S.D. Bramham C.R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7453-7461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or stimulate protein synthesis by activating translation cascades (31Takei N. Kawamura M. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Nawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42818-42825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test for the role of transcription in the up-regulation of glutamate receptor subunits by BDNF we used two different transcription inhibitors, α-amanitine (1.5 μm) and actinomycin D (1.5 μm). Both transcription inhibitors blocked the effect of BDNF on GluR1 and GluR2 protein levels, but were without effect on the abundance of the receptor subunits in the absence of the neurotrophin (Fig. 5). In agreement with these observations, real-time PCR using the SYBR green assay showed that BDNF stimulation for 30 min increased significantly the mRNA levels for GluR1, and when the cells were incubated with the neurotrophin for3 h a significant increase in the mRNA for GluR1 and GluR2 was also observed (Fig. 6). Taken together, the results indicate that BDNF regulates GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits at the transcription level. In contrast with the results obtained for GluR1 and GluR2, no effect of BDNF was observed on the mRNA levels for GluR3 and GluR4.FIGURE 6BDNF increases the mRNA levels of the GluR1 and GluR2 AMPA receptor subunits. The variation of GluR1 and GluR2 mRNA levels was assayed by SYBR Green real-time PCR of total RNA samples, converted to cDNA in reactions normalized to contain equal amounts of mRNA. The cells (7 DIV) were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml BDNF, during 30 min (gray columns) or 3 h (black columns). The results are presented as mean percentage ± S.E. compared with the control (unstimulated), and normalized to the reference gene 18 S, and are the average ± S.E. of 3–7 independent experiments, performed in independent preparations.

To study the effect of BDNF on the cell surface distribution of the AMPA receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2, 7 DIV cultured hippocampal neurons were treated with or without 100 ng/ml BDNF (30 min, 3 h, and 24 h). Following treatment, proteins on the cell surface were biotinylated, collected with streptavidin- or NeutrAvidin-coupled beads, and subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 7).

https://openalex.org/W2157095212,"The two lectin receptors, CLEC-2 and Dectin-1, have been shown to signal through a Syk-dependent pathway, despite the presence of only a single YXXL in their cytosolic tails. In this study, we show that stimulation of CLEC-2 in platelets and in two mutant cell lines is dependent on the YXXL motif and on proteins that participate in signaling by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif receptors, including Src, Syk, and Tec family kinases, and on phospholipase Cgamma. Strikingly, mutation of either Src homology (SH) 2 domain of Syk blocks signaling by CLEC-2 despite the fact that it has only a single YXXL motif. Furthermore, signaling by CLEC-2 is only partially dependent on the BLNK/SLP-76 family of adapter proteins in contrast to that of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif receptors. The C-type lectin receptor, Dectin-1, which contains a YXXL motif preceded by the same four amino acids as for CLEC-2 (DEDG), signals like CLEC-2 and also requires the two SH2 domains of Syk and is only partially dependent on the BLNK/SLP-76 family of adapters. In marked contrast, the C-type lectin receptor, DC-SIGN, which has a distinct series of amino acids preceding a single YXXL, signals independent of this motif. A mutational analysis of the DEDG sequence of CLEC-2 revealed that the glycine residue directly upstream of the YXXL tyrosine is important for CLEC-2 signaling. These results demonstrate that CLEC-2 and Dectin-1 signal through a single YXXL motif that requires the tandem SH2 domains of Syk but is only partially dependent on the SLP-76/BLNK family of adapters."
https://openalex.org/W2052078289,"The adipostat is the mechanism by which the brain detects and maintains constant levels of energy stored in adipocytes in the form of lipids. Key elements of the adipostat include the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin that is expressed in proportion to energy levels and serves to communicate this information to the central nervous system and the central circuits, which sense and respond to leptin. Blockade of one of these circuits, the central melanocortin system, disrupts leptin action and causes a distinct obesity syndrome in mice and humans, characterized by increased adiposity as well as increased linear growth. We show here that transgenic zebrafish overexpressing the endogenous melanocortin antagonist agouti-related protein (AgRP) also exhibit obesity, increased linear growth, and adipocyte hypertrophy. These findings demonstrate that key elements of the adipostat originated before the evolution of mammals. Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of AgRP in zebrafish yields a new model system for the genetic analysis of energy homeostasis in a simple vertebrate system."
https://openalex.org/W2081184877,"Apelin and its G-protein-coupled receptor APJ have various beneficial effects on cardiac function and blood pressure. The mechanisms that regulate apelin gene expression are not known. Because apelin gene expression has been shown to increase in cardiac ischemia, we investigated if apelin (Apln) gene expression was sensitive to hypoxia. Here we show that hypoxia increases the apelin expression in rat myocardium and in cultured cardiomyocytes. Pharmacological activation of hypoxia inducible factor by desferrioxamine (DFO) or expression of a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha increased apelin expression in cardiomyocyte cultures. The induction of apelin by hypoxia was abolished on transient expression of the HIF inhibitory PAS protein in cardiomyocytes. Increased apelin expression induced by hypoxia or DFO was accompanied by the processing of the cellular storage form proapelin into smaller apelin peptides and increased secretion of these biologically active forms of apelin. In a rat in vivo model, acute myocardial infarction (24 h) led to a transient increase in ventricular apelin mRNA levels. Our results indicate that apelin gene is regulated by hypoxia in cardiac myocytes via the HIF pathway, suggesting a role for apelin as a potential marker for acute cardiac hypoxia with a possible compensatory role in myocardial tissue suffering from oxygen deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W1999136265,"Elevated non-esterified fatty acids, triglyceride, diacylglycerol, and ceramide have all been associated with insulin resistance in muscle. We set out to investigate the role of intramyocellular lipid metabolites in the induction of insulin resistance in human primary myoblast cultures. Muscle cells were subjected to adenovirus-mediated expression of perilipin or incubated with fatty acids for 18 h, prior to insulin stimulation and measurement of lipid metabolites and rates of glycogen synthesis. Adenovirus-driven perilipin expression lead to significant accumulation of triacylglycerol in myoblasts, without any detectable effect on insulin sensitivity, as judged by the ability of insulin to stimulate glycogen synthesis. Similarly, incubation of cells with the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate resulted in triacylglycerol accumulation without inhibiting insulin action. By contrast, the saturated fatty acid palmitate induced insulin resistance. Palmitate treatment caused less accumulation of triacylglycerol than did oleate but also induced significant accumulation of both diacylglycerol and ceramide. Insulin resistance was also caused by cell-permeable analogues of ceramide, and palmitate-induced resistance was blocked in the presence of inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis. Oleate co-incubation completely prevented the insulin resistance induced by palmitate. Our data are consistent with ceramide being the agent responsible for insulin resistance caused by palmitate exposure. Furthermore, the triacylglycerol derived from oleate was able to exert a protective role in sequestering palmitate, thus preventing its conversion to ceramide. Elevated non-esterified fatty acids, triglyceride, diacylglycerol, and ceramide have all been associated with insulin resistance in muscle.

Obesity exerts a major impact on insulin resistance and is closely associated with type 2 diabetes (1Ohlson L.O. Larsson B. Svardsudd K. Welin L. Eriksson H. Wilhelmsen L. Bjorntorp P. Tibblin G. Diabetes. 1985; 34: 1055-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are overweight, and almost half are clinically obese (2Arch. Intern. Med. 2000; 160: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), furthermore the risk of developing diabetes increases dramatically with the degree of obesity. The relationship between obesity and insulin resistance has led to the hypothesis that ectopic storage of fat in non-adipose tissues such as skeletal muscle under conditions of lipid oversupply is causal in the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance, and elevated intramyocellular triacylglycerol (IMTG) 3The abbreviations used are: IMTG, intramyocellular triacylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; FA, fatty acid; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PKB, protein kinase B; TG, triacylglycerol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 3The abbreviations used are: IMTG, intramyocellular triacylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol; FA, fatty acid; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PKB, protein kinase B; TG, triacylglycerol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. levels have been identified as a potential link between increased non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) availability and insulin resistance. The molecular mechanism behind the coupling of IMTG content and insulin resistance is unclear, although it appears unlikely that a neutral lipid metabolite such as triacylglycerol (TG) directly impairs insulin action. Indeed, there is evidence that IMTG stores are elevated not only in insulin resistance but also in insulin-sensitive athletes (3Thamer C. Machann J. Bachmann O. Haap M. Dahl D. Wietek B. Tschritter O. Niess A. Brechtel K. Fritsche A. Claussen C. Jacob S. Schick F. Haring H.U. Stumvoll M. J. Clin Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Hence it is generally believed that IMTG represents a surrogate for other lipid metabolites in muscle. This includes an increasing body of evidence that lipid intermediates such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramides have direct effects on insulin signaling and glucose utilization.DAG has been identified as a potential mediator of lipid-induced insulin resistance. DAG has been shown to accumulate, together with triacylglycerol, in peripheral tissues from insulin-resistant rodents (4Turinsky J. O'Sullivan D.M. Bayly B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16880-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and to inhibit insulin action in various isolated tissues or cultured cells (5Chen K.S. Heydrick S. Kurowski T.

However, other studies have reported that DAG is dispensable to the development of insulin resistance. Specifically, in one study in C2C12 myotubes, the saturated fatty acid (FA), myristate induced significant DAG synthesis while having no effect on insulin sensitivity (10Chavez J.A. Summers S.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).The sphingomyelin derivative, ceramide, is another signaling molecule that has been implicated in several physiological events. Ceramide levels are elevated in muscle of insulin-resistant animals (4Turinsky J. O'Sullivan D.M. Bayly B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16880-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in skeletal muscle from obese, insulin-resistant humans (11Adams II, J.M. Pratipanawatr T. Berria R. Wang E. DeFronzo R.A. Sullards M.C. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Ceramide has also been shown to induce insulin resistance in a variety of cultured cells (6Hajduch E. Balendran A. Batty I.H. Litherland G.J. Blair A.S. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Ceramide can become elevated in muscle both by activation of sphingomyelinase, which produces ceramide from the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (15Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), and by de novo synthesis from palmitate (16Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In C2C12 myotubes, palmitate increases ceramide content and inhibits downstream insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (PKB) phosphorylation (14Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Incubation of these cells with short-chain ceramide analogues (C2-ceramide) mimics the effects of palmitate on insulin signaling, suggesting that ceramide generation from saturated fatty acids is sufficient to account for inhibition of insulin signaling. Furthermore, blocking de novo ceramide synthesis in palmitate-treated C2C12 myotubes negates the inhibitory effect of saturated NEFA toward PKB activation by insulin, while inducing ceramide accumulation augments the inhibitory effect of saturated NEFA (17Chavez J.A.

Similar inhibition of PKB phosphorylation has been observed in other cell types exposed to C2-ceramide, resulting in diminished insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle and fat cells (6Hajduch E.

Infinity™ Triglyceride reagent was from Sigma and 1,2-sn-diacylglyceride reagent kit was from GE Healthcare (Buckinghamshire, UK). [U-14C]-d-Glucose (10 GBq/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.11 TBq/mmol) were from GE Healthcare.Cell Culture—Human myoblasts were grown as described previously (21Halse R. Bonavaud S.M. Armstrong J.L. McCormack J.G. Yeaman S.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) from needle biopsies taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of healthy subjects with no family history of Type 2 diabetes and normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. All subjects gave informed consent and the study was approved by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Joint Ethics Committee. Myoblasts were maintained in Ham's F-10 supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) chick embryo extract, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All experiments were performed using cells between the 5th and 15th pass, at ∼90% confluence. Immunocytochemical staining with anti-desmin antibody confirmed that the cultures were predominantly myoblasts.Adenoviral Infection of Human Myoblasts—Myoblasts were infected at ∼70% confluence. Cells were incubated in 500 μl serum-free Ham's F-10 (containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 20–100 virus particles/cell for 2 h. Medium was replaced with growth medium and assays were performed, or cell extracts prepared, after 48 h.Fatty Acid Preparation and Treatment—Stock solutions (10 mm) of oleate and palmitate, complexed to 12% (w/v) BSA, were prepared. Fatty acids were dissolved in 4 ml of ethanol supplemented with 100 μl of 5 m NaCl and dried under nitrogen prior to resuspension in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. An optically clear solution was obtained upon heating to 60 °C with continuous agitation and an equal volume of ice-cold 24% FA-free BSA was immediately added. Samples were stored at -20 °C until required. Fatty acid stocks were diluted to appropriate concentrations in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium. Cells were washed three times with PBS prior to the addition of fatty acid-containing medium. Control cells were incubated in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium containing an equivalent concentration of BSA.Preparation of Cell Extracts for Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm KF, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Extracts were sonicated for 5 s at 3 μm amplitude (Soniprep 150, Sanyo). Protein concentration was determined using a dye binding method (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213426) Google Scholar). Samples (10 μg of protein) were mixed with 4× sample buffer (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% (w/v) SDS, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and dispersed by sonication for 5 min (Sonibath, Dawe). Extracts were resolved on 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described previously (21Halse R. Bonavaud S.M. Armstrong J.L. McCormack J.G. Yeaman S.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Oil Red O Staining—Lipids in myoblasts were visualized by histochemical staining with Oil Red O. Cells were rinsed and fixed in 60% isopropyl alcohol for 10 min then stained in 2% (w/v) Oil Red O for 5 min at room temperature. Excess stain was removed by washing in 60% isopropyl alcohol, followed by several changes of distilled water. Stained cells were visualized under a light microscope.Measurement of Glycogen Synthesis—The rate of glycogen synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [U-14C]glucose into glycogen as described previously (21Halse R. Bonavaud S.M. Armstrong J.L. McCormack J.G. Yeaman S.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FA-treated cells were incubated in serum-free Ham's F-10 supplemented with 400 μm of fatty acid, 0.5% (w/v) BSA for 18 h.Lipid Quantification—TG content was determined in cell extracts in a buffer of 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm KF, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) Lubrol PX, pH 7.9, sonicated three times for 5 s (Soniprep 150). Homogenates were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 15 min and supernatants collected. Total TG was measured enzymatically with Infinity™ Triglyceride kit, using trioleolylglycerol as standard. For measurement of DAG and ceramide concentrations, myoblasts were scraped into ice-cold PBS and standardized for protein concentration. Samples (100 μg protein) were transferred to polypropylene tubes and lipids extracted by adding 3 ml of ice-cold chloroform:methanol (1:2 v/v) and vortexing vigorously. NaCl (1 m) was added to bring the aqueous volume to 0.8 ml. Chloroform (1 ml) and 1 m NaCl (1 ml) were added to separate the phases. Following centrifugation at 5000 × g for 2 min, the lower chloroform phase was assayed for DAG and ceramide content using a radiometric DAG assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were applied to silica gel thin-layer plates, along with DAG and ceramide standards. Plates were developed in a tank presaturated with developing solvent (chloroform:acetic acid:acetone:methanol: water; 50:40:20:20:5). Plates were dried, and the zone corresponding to [32P] phosphatidic acid and [32P]ceramide 1-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography. Lipids were stained in iodine vapor, and spots corresponding to phosphatidic acid and ceramide 1-phosphate were scraped into scintillation vials and radioactivity determined.Statistical Analyses—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. Significance was assessed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test following analysis of variance. Sample sizes and p values for particular experiments are given in figure legends.RESULTSPerilipin, originally described as an adipocyte-specific protein, has now been detected in a number of tissues, located primarily on the surface of intracellular lipid droplets (23Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T.

It has been demonstrated that perilipin promotes lipid accumulation by protecting nascent lipid from hydrolysis by endogenous lipases (18Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 25Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In view of this, recombinant adenovirus encoding mouse perilipin A was used to infect myoblasts, to promote lipid accumulation. Perilipin A expression was detected 48 h after infection, with the level of protein expression increasing with increasing m.o.i. (Fig. 1A). Using an m.o.i. of 50 virus particles/cell, the effect of ectopic perilipin expression on lipid accumulation was studied. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, expression of perilipin A led to significant accumulation of intracellular lipid, as visualized by staining with Oil Red O. Enzymatic analysis of lipid extracted from these cells showed that they contained ∼3 times more triacylglycerol than cells infected with a control adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase (Fig. 1C). There was no detectable increase in the content of diacylglycerol or ceramide (Fig. 1C).The effect of insulin on the rate of glycogen synthesis in these cells was then examined, since this is the key physiological end point response for glucose disposal in muscle (Fig. 2). In untreated cells, insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis ∼4-fold. Following infection with adenovirus encoding β-galactosidase, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis was essentially unchanged. In the cells expressing perilipin A and with increased triacylglycerol content, again the effect of insulin on rate of glycogen synthesis was undiminished, with both basal and insulin-stimulated rates being unaltered. These data indicate clearly that intracellular triacylglycerol accumulation per se does not cause insulin resistance in this experimental system.FIGURE 2Effect of perilipin overexpression on glycogen synthesis. Myoblasts were infected with either Ad-Perilipin or Ad-β-gal at MOI of 50 virus particles per cell for 2 h. After 46 h cells were serum-starved for 2 h before glycogen synthesis was measured in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin over 1 h. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments in cells from three different subjects.

Both oleate and palmitate (respectively the major monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids in serum) caused significant accumulation of triacylglycerol. However, the levels in response to oleate were ∼4-fold higher that those formed in response to palmitate. The insulin sensitivity of these lipid-loaded cells was then investigated (Fig. 3B). Insulin stimulated glycogen synthesis ∼4-fold in control cells, and this effect was maintained in cells pretreated with oleate. Neither basal nor insulin-stimulated rates of glycogen synthesis were altered, despite the high levels of intracellular triacylglycerol. In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with palmitate caused a significant diminution in the response to insulin (the basal rate of glycogen synthesis was unaltered), despite the fact that the levels of triacylglycerol were lower than these formed in response to oleate. Taken together, these findings again indicate that intracellular triacylglycerol does not induce insulin resistance. However, incubation of cells with palmitate did render cells insulin-resistant, likely via the action of a metabolite derived from this fatty acid.FIGURE 3Effect of fatty acids on glycogen synthesis and lipid accumulation. Myoblasts were incubated in serum free medium supplemented with either 400 μm oleate or 400 μm palmitate for 18 h. Control wells contained 0.5% (w/v) BSA. A, fatty acids were washed away prior to determination of glycogen synthesis in the absence or presence of 100 nm insulin over 1 h.

Furthermore, palmitate is a precursor of ceramides. As both DAG and ceramides have known signaling functions, activating for example different isoforms of protein kinase C (26Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y.M. Seibenhener M.L. Vandenplas M.L. Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Way K.J. Katai N. King G.L. Diabet. Med. 2001; 18: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), their levels were investigated in cells preincubated with oleate and palmitate. As seen in Fig. 3, C and D, oleate treatment caused little, if any, alteration in the levels of DAG and ceramide, consistent with a preference for triacylglycerol synthesis from this fatty acid. In contrast, palmitate caused marked elevation in the amounts of DAG and ceramide, increasing them 6- and 3.5-fold, respectively. The observation that oleate, which causes mainly TG accumulation, does not induce insulin-resistance is again consistent with TG not being responsible for insulin resistance. In contrast, the finding that palmitate causes insulin resistance indicates that this may be due to one or both of its major lipid metabolites, namely DAG and ceramide.De novo ceramide synthesis occurs via palmitoyl-CoA and requires the activity of two enzymes, i.e. serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase (16Merrill Jr., A.H. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), which can be specifically inhibited by myriocin and fumonisin B1, respectively. To investigate therefore whether DAG or ceramide was the active agent in inducing insulin resistance, cells were incubated with palmitate in the presence or absence of each inhibitor. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, palmitate again induced insulin resistance, causing a dramatic decrease in the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by the hormone. The stimulation by insulin was unaffected by either inhibitor alone. However, when either inhibitor was present during palmitate treatment, insulin resistance was prevented. As expected, each inhibitor also prevented palmitate-induced ceramide accumulation (Fig. 4B) but did not prevent DAG accumulation caused by the fatty acid (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that ceramide was the agent responsible for inducing insulin resistance. This conclusion was further supported by use of C2-ceramide, a short-chain cell-permeable ceramide analogue. As seen in Fig. 5, treatment of myoblasts with this analogue completely abolished the stimulatory effect of insulin on the rate of glycogen synthesis. Use of the corresponding biologically inert analogue, C2-dihydroceramide, had no effect on the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin.FIGURE 4Effect of inhibiting de novo ceramide synthesis on inhibition of glycogen synthesis by palmitate.

https://openalex.org/W2135082924,"Immunotherapy with Abeta is expected to bring great improvement for Alzheimer disease (AD). However, clinical trials have been suspended because of meningoencephalitics, which accompanied lymphocytic infiltration. We have developed an oral vaccine for AD with a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector carrying Abeta cDNA (AAV/Abeta). The vaccine reduces the amount of Abeta deposited without lymphocytic infiltration in APP transgenic (Tg2576) mice. In the present study, Tg2576 mice showed progressive cognitive impairments in the novel object recognition test, Y-maze test, water maze test, and contextual conditioned fear learning test. A single oral administration of AAV/Abeta to Tg2576 mice at the age of 10 months alleviated progressive cognitive impairment with decreased Abeta deposition, insoluble Abeta, soluble Abeta oligomer (Abeta*56), microglial attraction, and synaptic degeneration induced in the brain regions at the age of 13 months. A histological analysis with hematoxylin and eosin and an immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 suggested there was no lymphocytic infiltration or microhemorrhage in the brain of AAV/Abeta-vaccinated Tg2576 mice at 13 months of age. Taken together, these results suggest that immunotherapy with AAV/Abeta is a safe and effective treatment for AD."

Selenoprotein H (SelH) is a recently discovered 14-kDa mammalian protein with no sequence homology to functionally characterized proteins. By sensitive sequence and structure analyses, we identified SelH as a thioredoxin fold-like protein in which a conserved CXXU motif (cysteine separated by two other residues from selenocysteine) corresponds to the CXXC motif in thioredoxins. These data suggest a redox function of SelH. Indeed, a recombinant SelH shows significant glutathione peroxidase activity. In addition, SelH has a conserved RKRK motif in the N-terminal sequence. We cloned wild-type and cysteine mutant forms of SelH either upstream or downstream of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and localized this fusion protein to the nucleus in transfected mammalian cells, whereas mutations in the RKRK motif resulted in the cytosolic protein. Interestingly, the full-length SelH-GFP fusion protein localized specifically to nucleoli, whereas the N-terminal sequence of SelH fused to GFP had a diffuse nucleoplasm location. Northern blot analyses revealed low expression levels of SelH mRNA in various mouse tissues, but it was elevated in the early stages of embryonic development. In addition, SelH mRNA was overexpressed in human prostate cancer LNCaP and mouse lung cancer LCC1 cells. Down-regulation of SelH by RNA interference made LCC1 cells more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but not to other peroxides tested. Overall, these data establish SelH as a novel nucleolar oxidoreductase and suggest that some functions in this compartment are regulated by redox and dependent on the trace element selenium.

Both proteins possess a thioredoxin-like domain and reside in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that these two proteins are thioldisulfide isomerases with a role in disulfide bond formation.Among other CXXU-containing selenoproteins, SelW is a better characterized protein, but its function also has not been defined (26Whanger P.D. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1846-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is the smallest mammalian selenoprotein existing in the form of several isoforms that differ by post-translational modifications (27Beilstein M.A. Vendeland S.C. Barofsky E. Jensen O.N. Whanger P.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 61: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Gu Q.P. Beilstein M.A. Barofsky E. Ream W. Whanger P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SelW is expressed in various tissues and is abundant in muscle. Reduced levels of SelW have been attributed to white muscle disease (29Gu Q.P. Sun Y. Ream L.W. Whanger P.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 204: 49-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SelV is a testis-specific distant homolog of SelW having an additional domain of unknown function (20Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google Scholar). Here we used computational, molecular, and cell biology techniques to characterize SelH, which revealed that this protein is a nucleolar oxidoreductase with an unusual expression pattern.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals were from Sigma, restriction enzymes from Amersham Biosciences, DNA purification kits from Qiagen, and mammalian cell culture reagents from Invitrogen. Primers used in the study are shown in supplemental Table S1.Multiple Sequence Alignment, Topology Prediction, and Structural Motif Search for SelH—All detected SelH sequences were extracted from GenBank™ nonredundant and EST databases and analyzed by BLAST (30Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69088) Google Scholar) and ClustalW software (31Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar). Localization of SelH was predicted using PSORT II (32Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar). PSI-BLAST/PHI-BLAST (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) searches with the default setting were carried out to detect conserved protein domains. The HHpred web-based program (34Soding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) was used for fold prediction.Recombinant Protein Expression in Escherichia coli and Antibody Production—Mouse SelH cDNA clone was purchased from Research Genetics. The Sec codon was substituted with that coding for Cys using QuikChange II kit (Stratagene) and the coding sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned into pET28a (Novagen). The resulting expression construct was further mutated to obtain CXXS and SXXC variants.Expression in E. coli BL21 DE3 cells (Novagen) and purification of the recombinant His-tagged protein using TALON resin (Clontech) was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocols. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant protein were produced by Covance.Activity Assays—Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was measured by a coupled reaction with glutathione (35Paglia D.E. Valentine W.N. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 70: 158-169PubMed Google Scholar) using hydrogen peroxide or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) as substrates and monitoring the decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm according to the manufacturer's protocol (BOIXYTECH GPx-340 assay kit, Oxis Research). The enzyme unit was defined as the amount of protein needed to catalyze the oxidation of 1 μmol NADPH/min. We assayed both Cys and Ser mutant forms of recombinant SelH and used mouse liver lysate as control.Identification of Target Proteins—Targets of SelH were identified by trapping mixed disulfides formed between affinity resins containing mutant SelH forms and proteins from a nuclear fraction of LCC1 cells. The affinity resins were prepared by cross-linking recombinant SelH proteins (CXXS and SXXC forms) to N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Nuclear fraction of LCC1 cells was prepared by differential centrifugation, homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and incubated with SelH-immobilized NHS-Sepharose resins for 1 h at 25 °C. The resins were extensively washed with PBS to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The resins were then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. The eluted samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were silver-stained. The stained bands were excised and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Data base searches of the acquired tandem mass spectra were performed using Mascot (Matrix Science, version 1.9.0, London, UK).Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Fusion Constructs—A set of chimera proteins included SelH fused C- or N-terminally with GFP. In brief, we amplified wild-type mouse SelH cDNA (construct number 5), prepared its Sec38Cys mutant, and cloned it into pEGFPN2 and pEGFP-C3 vectors (Clontech). We also prepared a construct by cloning a sequence coding for a 3-kDa N-terminal portion of SelH upstream of GFP (construct number 3). A putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) was disrupted by mutating arginines 6 and 8 to serines using the QuikChange II kit (Stratagene), and for each chimera, the corresponding mutant with disrupted NLS was obtained. Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and the images were captured using an Olympus FV500 inverted focal microscope at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Microscopy Core Facility.Immunohistochemistry—NIH 3T3 cells were seeded on coverslips and transfected with SelH-GFP fusion constructs. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed by flashing with ice-cold methanol containing 0.1% Triton X-100 followed by a 5-min treatment with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then treated with blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with rabbit anti-nucleolin antibodies (Novus Biologicals) and mouse monoclonal anti-UB2 antibodies (RDI Research Diagnostics) concurrently followed by washing with PBS and treatment with donkey anti-mouse Cy5-conjugated and monkey anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The samples were then washed with PBS and distilled water and mounted with Gel/Mount (Biomeda). Dilutions of all commercial antibodies were as suggested by the manufacturers.Gene Expression Analyses—An in silico expression analysis was performed using the SAGE Genie web resource (cgap.nci.nih.gov/SAGE) (36Boon K. Osorio E.C. Greenhut S.F. Schaefer C.F. Shoemaker J. Polyak K. Morin P.J. Buetow K.H. Strausberg R.L. De Souza S.J. Riggins G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11287-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Pre-made Northern blot membranes (mouse adult tissue blot and mouse conceptus embryonic tissue blot) were purchased from Seegene and probed with 0.3-kb 32P-labeled (Redivue [32P]dCTP, Amersham Biosciences) SelH cDNA. The probe was generated using the Rediprime II random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. To analyze the expression in cell lines, total RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion), separated on an agarose gel, transferred onto a Zeta-Probe blotting membrane (Bio-Rad, protocol from (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989: 16.33-16.37Google Scholar)), and probed as described above.Western Blot Analyses—Tissues were extracted from euthanized mice, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until the day of analysis. The tissues were homogenized in PBS containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and the lysates were normalized with regard to protein concentration. 10% BisTris NOVEX gels (Invitrogen) were used, and each well was loaded with 25 μg of protein. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen) and probed with anti-SelH antibodies. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences, and chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate was from Sigma. Lysates from various human cancer cell lines (a generous gift from Dr. Katerina Gurova, Cleveland BioLabs) were examined as described above.Cell Culture Labeling, Subcellular Fractionation, and Nucleoli Preparation—Experiments involving metabolic labeling of selenoproteins were carried out by adding 75Se ([75Se]selenious acid; specific activity 1,000 Ci/mmol, Research Reactor Facility, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) to the culture medium as described previously (38Kryukov G.V. Kryukov V.M. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33888-33897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Separation of cytoplasm and nuclear fractions was performed as described elsewhere (39Berrios M. Nuclear Structure and Function (Methods in Cell Biology). Academic Press, New York1997: 6-15Google Scholar). In brief, following labeling for 48 h, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, homogenized using a tight pestle in 0.25 m sucrose buffer containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and cytosolic and nuclear fractions were separated by differential centrifugation. The resulting cellular fractions were normalized in regard to protein concentration, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and then 75Se-labeled proteins were visualized with a Storm PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). Further subfractionation of nuclear compartments to obtain nucleoli and nucleoplasm fractions was conducted as described previously (40Busch H. Muramatsu M. Adams H. Steele W.J. Liau M.C. Smetana K. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 24: 150-163Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with modifications (41Andersen J.S. Lam Y.W. Leung A.K. Ong S.E. Lyon C.E. Lamond A.I. Mann M. Nature. 2005; 433: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar).RNA Interference in LCC1 Cell Line and Oxidative Stress— To knock down SelH gene expression, five separate 21-nucleotide sequences were selected from SelH cDNA as being unique using the online service “siDESIGN” of Dharmacon Research, Inc. These small interfering RNA constructs of pU6-m3 were prepared as described previously (42Xu X.M. Mix H. Carlson B.A. Grabowski P.J. Gladyshev V.N. Berry M.J. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41568-41575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The sequences of all five SelH small interfering RNA constructs were confirmed. The five constructs and the pU6-m3 negative control plasmids were separately transfected into LLC1 cells. After stabilizing the transfected cells with 0.8 mg/ml hygromycin, SelH mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. Based on mRNA levels, the best small interfering RNA target sequences of SelH were identified as 5′-GAA TTG AAG AAG TAC CTT TCA-3′. These small interfering RNA constructs were used in subsequent experiments.Sensitivity of LCC1 cells to oxidative stress was analyzed by the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). 5 × 103 cells were seeded into each well in 96-well plates and grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 100 μl of serum/phenol red-free medium containing the indicated (Fig. 6B) concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or 0–1 mm t-BOOH, cumyl hydroperoxide or paraquat for 1 h at 37 °C. To examine sensitivity to menadione, we used 0–30 μm treatment with this compound for 6 h. 20 μl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent were added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. The A490 value was recorded using an ELx808 Ultra microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of untreated controls, and the wells without cells were used as a blank.Evolutionary Analysis—Amino acid sequence alignment of SelH sequences was generated using the PileUP program. The distances between sequences were calculated from these alignments using the DISTANCE program with the Kimura distance-measuring method, and then the unrooted phylogenetic tree with unscaled distance branches was generated using the GrowTree program with the unweighted pair-group method. All programs were part of the Wisconsin Package, Genetic Computer Group, Madison, WI (43Senger M. Flores T. Glatting K. Ernst P. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Suhai S. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSelH Is a Putative Nuclear Oxidoreductase—Available SelH sequences were collected and assembled into a multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 1A). SelH sequences contain a conserved CXXU motif, which is flanked upstream by a predicted β-strand and downstream by a predicted α-helix. This arrangement is highly similar to thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin fold; however, the latter proteins have a CXXC motif instead of CXXU (44Martin J.L. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 45Kinch L.N. Baker D. Grishin N.V. Proteins. 2003; 52: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The use of advanced BLAST programs (PSI-BLAST/PHI-BLAST) (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59138) Google Scholar) with several iterations revealed a distant homology to thioredoxin fold proteins. Indeed, further analysis with HHPred identified a thioredoxin-like fold in SelH. Structural alignment places the CXXU motif in SelH in the same place as the CXXC motif in thioredoxin. These data suggest that SelH is an oxidoreductase that uses its CXXU motif as the reversible thiolselenol/selenenylsulfide redox group.FIGURE 1Redox properties of SelH. A, multiple sequence alignment of SelH sequences. The locations of CXXU (which corresponds to the CXXC motif in thioredoxins) and NLS motifs are indicated by boxes, respectively. The predicted secondary structure is shown above the sequence. B, glutathione peroxidase activity of SelH. The indicated recombinant forms of SelH (CXXS and CXXC forms) or mouse liver lysate were assayed for GPx activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions were initiated by adding 300 μm H2O2 or 233 μm t-BOOH as the substrate. mU, milliunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence analysis also revealed nuclear localization signals (46Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) in SelH sequences. Remarkably, SelH proteins have a high content of basic residues (18.3% in mouse and 22.2% in zebrafish) due to the high occurrence of arginines and lysines. By using PSORT II, we found six putative NLSs in the SelH sequences of chickens (all monopartite), three in zebrafish (all monopartite), and eight in mice and humans (six monopartite and two bipartite). Comparison of NLS location and conservations using the multiple sequence alignment showed that only two NLS were conserved, of which one was in the N-terminal and one in C-terminal sequences. Within the N-terminal NLS, the two strictly conserved residues were Arg-6 and Arg-8 (Fig. 1A) (numbering based on the mouse SelH sequence), suggesting that these residues have a critical role in nuclear import as a part of NLS.Peroxidase Activity of Recombinant SelH—To further elucidate whether SelH is an oxidoreductase, we performed several biochemical tests with recombinant mutant forms of the protein in which the Sec residue was substituted with Cys or Ser. Specifically, these mutants were assayed for thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, and GPx activities. In the thioredoxin assay, mammalian thioredoxin reductase 1 was used as the reductant and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as the oxidant (47Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Krause G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4056-4066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a separate assay involved insulin reduction, as in the corresponding assay of thioredoxin function (49Bjornstedt M. Hamberg M. Kumar S. Xue J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11761-11764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We could detect no thioredoxin activity of SelH (data not shown). The peroxiredoxin activity was examined in an assay of protection of glutamine synthetase activity (47Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SelH also showed no activity in this assay. Interestingly, SelH had a significant GPx activity (Fig. 1B). This activity was detected only with hydrogen peroxide, whereas t-BOOH was not active as a substrate. The Cys mutant had four times higher activity than the Ser mutant of SelH. We further compared the GPx activity of SelH with that of mammalian GPx1 using mouse liver lysate and quantitative Western blot analysis of GPx1 amounts in the sample (not shown). This comparison revealed that the GPx activity of the Cys mutant was 2,000–4,000-fold lower than that of natural mouse liver GPx1 under the conditions used in the assay. It should be pointed out that, although SelH had a much lower activity than GPx1, we assayed the Cys form of the natural Sec-containing SelH. In addition, the peroxidase activity detected was similar to the activities of peroxiredoxins in the reduction of hydroperoxides. Thus, these data provided further evidence for the oxidoreductase activity of SelH. The natural oxidoreductase activity of SelH, however, remains unknown, and further studies will be needed to identify specific substrates/targets of this protein.Identification of Target Proteins— The finding that SelH possesses a thioredoxin fold and has a putative CXXU redox motif suggests analogy with thioredoxin-like proteins that form transient disulfides with target proteins. Mutation of a resolving Cys in the CXXC motif of thioredoxin often results in stabilization of such complexes (51Holmgren A. Johansson C. Ber"
https://openalex.org/W2119381959,"Background The basic idea of tag-based models for cooperation is that individuals recognize each other via arbitrary signals, so-called tags. If there are tags of different colors, then cooperators can always establish new signals of recognition. The resulting “chromodynamics” is a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Cooperators use a secret tag until they are discovered by defectors who then destroy cooperation based on this tag. Subsequently, a fraction of the population manages to establish cooperation based on a new tag. Methodology/Principal Findings We derive a mathematical description of stochastic evolutionary dynamics of tag-based cooperation in populations of finite size. Benefit and cost of cooperation are given by b and c. We find that cooperators are more abundant than defectors if b/c > 1+2u/v, where u is the mutation rate changing only the strategy and v is the mutation rate changing strategy and tag. We study specific assumptions for u and v in two genetic models and one cultural model. Conclusions/Significance In a genetic model, tag-based cooperation only evolves if a gene encodes both strategy and tag. In a cultural model with equal mutation rates between all possible phenotypes (tags and behaviors), the crucial condition is b/c > (K+1)/(K−1), where K is the number of tags. A larger number of tags requires a smaller benefit-to-cost ratio. In the limit of many different tags, the condition for cooperators to have a higher average abundance than defectors becomes b > c."

The proteolytic maturation of the 375-kDa viral polyprotein is one target for antiviral development. The flavivirus serine protease consists of the N-terminal domain of the multifunctional nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) and an essential 40-residue cofactor (NS2B40) within viral protein NS2B. The NS2B-NS3 protease is responsible for all cytoplasmic cleavage events in viral polyprotein maturation. This study describes the first biochemical characterization of flavivirus protease activity using full-length NS3. Recombinant proteases were created by fusion of West Nile virus (WNV) NS2B40 to full-length WNV NS3. The protease catalyzed two autolytic cleavages. The NS2B/NS3 junction was cleaved before protein purification. A second site at Arg459↓Gly460 within the C-terminal helicase region of NS3 was cleaved more slowly. Autolytic cleavage reactions also occurred in NS2B-NS3 recombinant proteins from yellow fever virus, dengue virus types 2 and 4, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Cis and trans cleavages were distinguished using a noncleavable WNV protease variant and two types of substrates as follows: an inactive variant of recombinant WNV NS2B-NS3, and cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins fused by a dodecamer peptide encompassing a natural cleavage site. With these materials, the autolytic cleavages were found to be intramolecular only. Autolytic cleavage of the helicase site was insensitive to protein dilution, confirming that autolysis is intramolecular. Formation of an active protease was found to require neither cleavage of NS2B from NS3 nor a free NS3 N terminus.

The NS2B40 cofactor contributes to the binding site for the P2 residue of the substrate, based on the structure of WNV NS2B-NS3 protease domain in complex with a substrate-based inhibitor (24Erbel P. Schiering N. D'Arcy A. Renatus M. Kroemer M. Lim S.P. Yin Z. Keller T.H. Vasudevan S.G. Hommel U. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Here we report single polypeptide variants of NS2B-NS3 protease from five flaviviruses. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing flavivirus protease activity using the NS2B40 cofactor and full-length NS3. Detailed experiments on the WNV protease demonstrated that the NS2B/NS3 junction and the internal NS3 site are cleaved in cis only. In some variants, product inhibition by the NS2B C terminus was also observed. Plasmid Construction—Constructs encoding WNV (strain NY99) proteins were derived from pWN-CG (27Beasley D.W. Whiteman M.C. Zhang S. Huang C.Y. Schneider B.S. Smith D.R. Gromowski G.D. Higgs S. Kinney R.M. Barrett A.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8339-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Richard Kinney, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the fusion of the C-terminal 79 residues (residues 53-131) of NS2B with full-length NS3, a 2154-nucleotide fragment was amplified from pWN-CG, using primers WNV-NS2B53-F and WNV-NS3FL619STOP-R (supplemental Table 1), and cloned between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites in pET28 (Strat-agene) to generate pNS2B53-131-NS3FL (simply pWNV-NS2B79-NS3FL). Other WNV plasmids were constructed in two steps. First, an 1857-nucleotide fragment was amplified from pWN-CG by primers WNV-NS31-F and WNV-NS3619STOP-R and cloned into pET28 between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites to generate pWNV-NS3FL encoding full-length NS3. Then fragments encoding the 41-residue protease cofactor within NS2B (residues 53-93) were amplified from pWN-CG using primers WN-NS2B53-F and either WNV-NS2B93-R or WNV-NS2B95-G4SG4-R. The fragments were digested with NdeI and cloned into NdeI-restricted pWNV-NS3FL to generate either pWNV-NS2B53-93-HM-NS3FL (simply pWNV-NS2B40-HM-NS3FL) or pWNV-NS2B53-95-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL (simply pWNV-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL). Plasmids encoding the active proteases for YFV (pYFV-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL), DV2 (pDV2-NS2B40-G4SG4-ASR-NS3FL), dengue virus type 4 (DV4, pDV4-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL), and JEV (pJEV-NS2B40-G4SG4-ASR-NS3FL) were constructed in two steps, as described for the WNV protease. PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table 1. For the YFV, and DV4 constructs, an NdeI site between the sequences for the NS2B cofactor and NS3 encoded the amino acids His-Met. For the DV2 and JEV constructs, an NheI site was used, corresponding to Ala-Ser and followed by a basic residue “R,” corresponding to the C-terminal residue of NS2B. The plasmid for YFV, pACNR/FLYF (28Bredenbeek P.J. Kooi E.A. Lindenbach B. Huijkman N. Rice C.M. Spaan W.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 1261-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), was provided by Charles Rice, Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, and plasmids for DV2 and DV4 were from Richard Kinney, and a partial cDNA clone of JEV was from Tsutomu Takegami, Medical Research Institute of Kanazawa Medical University. Inactive proteases with alanine substitutions at Ser135 (WNV, DV2, DV4, and JEV) or Ser138 (YFV) in the catalytic triad of NS3 were made by site-directed mutagenesis. For WNV, the substitution was generated by PCR from pWNV-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL and primers WNV-S135A-F and WNV-S135A-R, yielding pWNV-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/S135A. The PCR product was digested with DpnI before transformation. The plasmid pCYFP28 encoding cyan (CFP) and yellow fluorescent proteins (YFP) separated by multiple restriction sites was provided by Todd W. Geders (from our laboratory), in the pET28 vector with a C-terminal His tag. The annealed product of S-WNV-2B/3-1 and S-WNV-2B/3-2 (supplemental Table 1) encoding the sequence LQYTKR/GGVLWD between BamHI and HindIII restriction sites was ligated into pCYFP28 to generate pWNV-CFP-LQYTKR/GGVLWD-YFP (or simply pWNV-CFP-2B/3-YFP). Constructs encoding other substrates were made similarly using primers listed in supplemental Table 1. The composition of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Gene Expression and Protein Purification—The plasmid, pWNV-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL, was used for high level, inducible expression of N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged recombinant proteins. Cultures of Escherichia coli strain Rosetta2 (Novagen) transformed with the expression plasmids were grown in 1 liter of LB medium containing 35 μg/ml chlor-amphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until the A600 = 0.5. The temperature was reduced to 18 °C, and expression of the recombinant protein was induced by addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranose to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, cultures were incubated for an additional 12 h at 18 °C, and cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol), lysed by three passes through a French press at a pressure of 1000 pascals, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) containing 50 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 50-300 mm imidazole in Buffer A. Fractions containing NS2B-NS3 proteins, determined by 12% SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A, first with and then without 2 mm EDTA, concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Centriprep-50 (Millipore), increased to 15% glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. Yields for all WNV protease variants that included 40 residues of the NS2B cofactor were reproducibly 12 mg of purified protein per liter of E. coli culture. The variant with 79 residues of NS2B was produced in lower yield. Some proteins (using plasmids pWNV-NS2B79-NS3FL, pDV2-NS2B40-G4SG4-ASR-NS3FL, and pYFV-NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL) were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. Proteins were dialyzed in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 75 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol, loaded into a 1-ml HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a linear gradient of 75-300 mm NaCl. Protease Assay—For self-cleavage reactions, purified proteins were diluted to the stated concentration (0.25-5.0 mg/ml) in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 35% glycerol (v/v)), incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times, and quenched by addition of an SDS-PAGE loading buffer to a final concentration of 2% SDS. For intermolecular cleavage reactions, substrate and enzyme were diluted separately to 1 mg/ml in assay buffer, mixed in a 1:4 ratio (enzyme:substrate), unless indicated otherwise, and incubated for the indicated time. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometric results were obtained in the Purdue Campus-wide Mass Spectrometry Facility using an Applied Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager DE PRO mass spectrometer, which uses a nitrogen laser (337 nm) for ionization with a time-of-flight mass analyzer. The positive-ion mass spectra were obtained in the linear mode with an accelerating voltage of 25 kV, a grid voltage of 85%, an extraction delay time of 98 ns, and 150 laser shots per spectrum. The matrix was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (1 mg/ml in 75% ethanol). Equal volumes of the sample and matrix were mixed and air-dried prior to analysis. The acquisition mass range was 500-10,000 daltons with an instrument error of 0.1%. Design and Production of Recombinant Flavivirus NS2B-NS3—Flavivirus protease activity is dependent on the association of NS3 with a cofactor (NS2B40), a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain within the largely hydrophobic NS2B protein. To produce active NS2B-NS3 proteases from five flaviviruses, we engineered proteins in which the 40-residue cofactor from NS2B (NS2B40, residues 54-93 of WNV NS2B) was fused to the N terminus of full-length NS3 (NS3FL) by a flexible 9-residue linker followed by a noncleavable dipeptide, Gly4-Ser-Gly4-His-Met (G4SG4-HM) (Fig. 2). A hexahistidine tag was engineered at the N terminus to facilitate purification of NS2B-NS3 protease. Similar recombinant forms of NS2B-NS3 protease were engineered by fusion of the respective NS2B cofactors with NS3 from YFV, DV2, DV4, and JEV. All recombinant proteins were produced in an E. coli expression system at 18 °C. The major proportion of the expressed protein was present in the soluble fractions of cell lysate, indicating that recombinant proteins were likely to be folded correctly. The proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography via the His6 tags (in some cases followed by anion-exchange chromatography). SDS-PAGE analysis of purified proteins revealed fragments of lower molecular weight in addition to the expected products (Fig. 3, lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14). These lower molecular weight products increased upon longer incubation at 37 °C (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15), indicative of proteolysis. However, none of the lower molecular weight fragments was detected in preparations of recombinant proteins in which the protease catalytic serine was substituted with alanine (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16) and in which each protein was produced in identical yield to its corresponding parent. Thus, the recombinant NS2B-NS3 protease is subject to autolytic cleavage. At least two sites of autolysis are apparent in most of the NS2B-NS3 proteins, although the five proteases differ in their susceptibility to autolytic cleavage. Further analysis of cleavage was performed using the WNV NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL protein.FIGURE 3Analysis of five purified recombinant flavivirus NS2B-NS3 proteases. SDS-PAGE of purified NS2B-NS3 from West Nile virus (lanes 2-4), yellow fever virus (lanes 5-7), dengue virus type 2 (lanes 8-10), dengue virus type 4 (lanes 11-13), and Japanese encephalitis virus (lanes 14-16). For each recombinant protein, the 1st lane is freshly purified protein, the 2nd lane is protein following a 2-h incubation at 37 °C; the 3rd lane is the purified protease-inactive mutant (S135A or S138A). The active and inactive forms of each protease were produced in equivalent yields. Equivalent amounts of total protein were loaded in all lanes of the gel. The predicted size of the intact recombinant protein is 77 kDa. Molecular mass markers are in lane 1. Autolytic cleavage of each of the proteases is apparent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sites of Autolytic Cleavage of WNV NS2B-NS3—Fragments of 8, 18.5, 50.5, and 69 kDa were detected in the recombinant NS2B-NS3 protein from WNV, indicative of two cleavage sites in the full-length protein of 77 kDa (Figs. 3 and 4). These sites were cleaved at different rates. One site was cleaved completely prior to purification, yielding fragments of 69 and 8 kDa (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Cleavage of the 69-kDa fragment at a second site was slower, as seen at time points during incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-6). All fragments were associated with the natively folded protein because they did not dissociate upon additional steps of nickel-affinity, anion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography of the monomeric protein (supplemental Fig. 1). To identify the site of rapid cleavage, NS2B-NS3 was analyzed by mass spectrometry. A fragment of 7870 ± 8Dawas identified, which corresponds to cleavage at the “noncleavable” junction following the Gly4-Ser-Gly4-His-Met linker between NS2B and NS3 (compared with 7863 Da, calculated mass; data not shown). The cleavage site was also identified by N-terminal sequencing of the 69-kDa fragment, which yielded the sequence Gly-Gly-Val-Leu-Trp-Asp, corresponding to the N terminus of NS3, indicating that cleavage occurs at the site G4SG4HM↓GGVLWD. Mutagenesis at this site, for experiments described below, provided further confirmation of the site identity. We designate this cleavage as an “N-terminal cleavage.” Cleavage at this site was unexpected because the sequence at the site, HM↓GG, is unlike the natural cleavage sequences at the critical P1 residue (Met versus Arg, see Fig. 1B), and substitution of Leu for Arg in the P1 position of the YFV NS2B-NS3 protease domain led to no detectable cleavage (29Chambers T.J. Nestorowicz A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1600-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, autolytic cleavage of a similar NS2B40-fused construct of WNV NS3pro was reported at NS3 residue Lys15 (22Shiryaev S.A. Ratnikov B.I. Chekanov A.V. Sikora S. Rozanov D.V. Godzik A. Wang J. Smith J.W. Huang Z. Lindberg I. Samuel M.A. Diamond M.S. Strongin A.Y. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), in a sequence (KK↓G) similar to natural flavivirus protease sites. We anticipated cleavage at Lys15-Gly16 when we detected the 8-kDa fragment, and we engineered a protein in which the nonconserved Gly16 was substituted with Leu. This substitution had no impact on appearance of the 8-kDa fragment (data not shown). We conclude that the Lys15-Gly16 site is less accessible to the protease active site in full-length NS3 than it is in the isolated protease domain (NS3pro). We also attempted to isolate the full-length NS2B-NS3 protein by including protease inhibitors in the lysis buffer for cells from a fresh culture, but the protein was fully cleaved when it emerged from E. coli (supplemental Fig. 2). The second, slower autolytic cleavage was presumed to occur within the helicase domain, where NS3 cleavage has been reported in cells infected with DV2 (10Arias C.F. Preugschat F. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1993; 193: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 12Teo K.F. Wright P.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), at a site corresponding to Arg459-Gly460 in WNV NS3. Cleavage at this site was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the C-terminal fragment. The resulting sequence, Gly-Arg-Ile-Gly-Arg, corresponded to NS3 residues 460-464. The cleavage site was also confirmed by mutagenesis to produce the G460L substitution. The 8- and 69-kDa fragments were present in the purified proteins, but the 18.5- and 50.5-kDa fragments were not detected for NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/G460L (Fig. 4C, lanes 14-18), confirming that the slower cleavage occurs in the helicase region at Arg459↓Gly460. We designate this as the internal helicase site. No autolytic cleavages were observed with enzymatically inactive NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/S135A (Fig. 4B, lane 8-12). An Artificial Substrate to Study Cleavage Specificity—To examine the unexpected N-terminal cleavage, we created an artificial substrate containing several variants of the natural NS2B-NS3 cleavage sequence (Fig. 1B). In this construct, a dodecapeptide encompassing the natural NS2B/NS3 junction was engineered between two fluorescent proteins, CFP and YFP, to create “CFP-2B/3-YFP” (LQYTKRP1↓GP1′ GVLWD). Proteolytic activity with this substrate was assayed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the reaction mixture, in which substrate (59.3 kDa, Fig. 5, lane 3), enzyme (lane 2), and two products (29.5 and 29.8 kDa, Fig. 5, lane 4) were easily distinguished, or by cleavage-induced loss of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between CFP and YFP (data not shown). We also made several artificial substrates containing substitutions in the NS2B/NS3 junction to check cleavage specificity. The artificial substrate (CFP-LQYTKR↓GGVLWD-YFP) containing the natural sequence of the NS2B/NS3 junction was cleaved efficiently (Fig. 5, lane 4). Substitution of Asp for Arg at the P1 position (Fig. 5, lane 5) or Asp for Gly at the P1′ position (lane 6) abolished the cleavage activity. Two artificial substrates containing HM↓GG, the site that was cleaved rapidly in the full-length enzyme, were also tested. Neither CFP-LQYTHMGGVLWD-YFP, containing the natural NS2B/NS3 junction with KR replaced by HM, nor CFP-GGGGHMGGVLWD-YFP, containing the junction sequence from our recombinant enzyme, was cleaved in the artificial substrate (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that either HM↓GG is not a substrate for intermolecular cleavage or that a cleavage-competent conformation of HM↓GG is not accessible in the context of the artificial substrate. The natural cleavage sites (Fig. 1B) for flavivirus NS2B-NS3 proteases generally have two basic residues (Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys or Lys-Arg) at the P2 and P1 positions and a small amino acid (Gly, Ser, or Ala) at the P1′ position. In contrast to the N-terminal HM↓GG cleavage site, the internal helicase cleavage site has a sequence very similar to the natural inter-protein sites (Fig. 1B). We also made an artificial substrate, CFP-SAAQRR↓GRIGRN-YFP, containing the Arg459↓Gly460 cleavage site observed in the recombinant protein. However, cleavage of this artificial substrate was barely detectable (Fig. 5, lane 9). In the context of the artificial substrate, efficient cleavage of the natural NS2B-NS3 site is in striking contrast to the lack of cleavage of the two sites of autolysis, suggesting that the autolytic reactions may occur in cis. Thus we designed materials to test this possibility explicitly. Intramolecular Proteolytic Cleavage of WNV NS2B-NS3—To determine whether the autolytic cleavage is intramolecular (cis) or intermolecular (trans), we designed, expressed, and purified a natural substrate for trans cleavage (Fig. 6A). The protein, NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/S135A, has intact N-terminal and helicase cleavage sites but lacks the protease catalytic side chain (Ser135). NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/S135A undergoes no autolytic cleavage (Fig. 6, lane 3) in 2 h at 37 °C, whereas autolysis by the parent enzyme (NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL) results in complete cleavage at the N-terminal site and more than 50% cleavage at the internal helicase site under the same conditions (lane 9). We also designed, expressed, and purified an enzyme lacking both of the N-terminal and internal cleavage sites (NS2B40-G4SG4-HD-NS3FL/G460L). This protein undergoes no autolytic cleavage (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7), as expected, but is an efficient enzyme against the artificial substrate CFP-LQYTKR↓GGVLWD-YFP (lanes 17 and 18). To detect intermolecular hydrolysis, the substrate, NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/S135A, was incubated with the enzyme, NS2B40-G4SG4-HD-NS3FL/G460L. We observed no trans cleavage of substrate NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL/S135A (Fig. 6, lanes 10 and 11) by enzyme NS2B40-G4SG4-HD-NS3FL/G460L under conditions in which this enzyme completely hydrolyzed the artificial substrate (lanes 17 and 18). These results clearly indicate intramolecular cleavage of both the N-terminal site (GGGGHM↓GGVLWD) and the internal helicase site (SAAQRR↓ GRIGRN) of recombinant NS2B-NS3. The natural cleavage sequence at the NS2B/NS3 junction was also tested for trans cleavage by construction of the substrate NS2B40-G4SG4-KR-NS3FL/S135A. A low level of N-terminal cleavage was seen using the trans substrate (Fig. 6, lanes 12 and 13), but this was far below the rate of cis cleavage of the parent construct (lanes 8 and 9). Further confirmation of cis cleavage was provided by a dilution experiment using purified NS2B40-G4SG4-HM-NS3FL. The rate of cleavage"

Alternative splicing is the process by which exons from a primary transcript (pre-mRNA) can be spliced in different arrangements to yield mRNAs that will produce functionally different protein variants. The sequencing of the human genome has revealed that up to 75% of multiexon genes are alternatively spliced (1Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z. Loerch P.M. Armour C.D. Santos R. Schadt E.E. Stoughton R. Shoemaker D.D. Science. 2003; 302: 2141-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). A clear understanding of the mechanisms regulating splicing is key to our comprehension of the complex regulation of the eukaryotic genome and can provide us with new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The spliceosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex that removes non-coding intervening sequences called introns from precursor mRNA. Within the intron, a 3′ splice site, 5′ splice site, and branch site are required for splicing. These are short, loosely conserved sequences that alone are not sufficient for the proper recognition of exonic and intronic sequences and regulation of splicing. Additional regulatory elements are classified according to their location and function, because either exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs) 2The abbreviations used are: ESE, exonic splicing enhancer; ISE, intronic splicing enhancer; ESS, exonic splicing silencer; ISS, intronic splicing silencer; SR family, serine/arginine-rich family; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; Ni-NTA, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid; RAC, RNA-affinity chromatography; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. or exonic and intronic splicing silencers (ESSs and ISSs). These regulatory sequences can interact with factors that promote proper recognition of the splice sites and regulate splicing in response to physiological stimuli. Among the best characterized ESEs are purine-rich sequences that recruit members of the serine/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing activators (2Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The best known ESSs are dependent on interaction with members of the heterogenous ribonucleoprotein A/B family (hnRNPs A/B). Dissection of the mechanisms regulating alternative splicing in several genes has shown that positive and negative cis-acting sequences are organized in multipartite control elements where SR proteins and hnRNPs often play counteracting roles (3Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol.

PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). hnRNPs H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1 constitute a family of highly homologous, ubiquitously expressed proteins that have been implicated in splicing, polyadenylation, capping, export, and translation of cellular and viral mRNAs. hnRNPs H, H′, 2H9, and F have been shown to interact with both splicing enhancers and silencers. The binding of these proteins to intronic sequences activates neural-specific splicing of the c-src mRNA (6Min H. Chan R.C. Black D.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar), and promotes inclusion of the CI exon of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-type glutamate R1 receptor (GRIN1) (5Han K. Yeo G. An P. Burge C.B. Grabowski P.J. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the HIV-1 exon 6D (10Caputi M. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Binding of hnRNPs H and F to a regulatory element within the alternatively spliced coding exon 1 of the bcl-x gene promotes splicing to the bcl-xs-specific 5′ splice site (11Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). hnRNP H has also been shown to inhibit both splicing of the rat β-tropomyosin gene, by binding an exonic silencer (12Chen C.D. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and Rous sarcoma virus splicing by binding an intronic element (13Fogel B.L. McNally M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32371-32378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Little is known of the mechanisms by which hnRNP H family members act in splicing silencing or activation, and it is not understood whether the basal splicing machinery requires such proteins to function (14Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). In this work, we identified the minimal RNA motif recognized by hnRNPs H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1 as the consensus sequence DGGGD. To evaluate whether the consensus DGGGD binding motif affects splicing independently from its location in respect to the splice sites and other splicing control elements, we systematically mutated the consensus motifs of a splicing substrate derived from the HIV-1 tat gene. Surprisingly, only two out of eight motifs appeared to be regulating splicing, suggesting that interaction with other regulatory elements and/or proper positioning within a higher order RNA structure may be required for splicing control by hnRNPs of the H family. Furthermore, in vitro splicing assays and analysis of spliceosome complex formation, following depletion add-back of individual hnRNP H proteins, indicated that members of this family play a key role in ATP-dependent spliceosome formation. Plasmid Construction and Protein Preparation—Splicing reporter plasmids were derived from the plasmids pTat12 and pTat12ESSMut previously described as pHS1-X and pΔESS10, respectively (15Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3960-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Constructs carrying the mutations of the G-runs were obtained by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. Construct pTat12ESSMut-5′M was obtained by mutating the conserved GT dinucleotide of the pTat12ESSMut 5′ splice site by site-directed mutagenesis. The hnRNP H, hnRNP F, and hnRNP 2H9 cDNAs were cloned into the expression vector PrsetB (Invitrogen). The recombinant N-terminal histidine-tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The bacterial cells were grown to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopy-ranoside for 3 h. Induced cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 m NaCl. Pellets were dissolved in the same 6 m urea buffer, lysed, and loaded onto a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. Proteins were refolded with a linear urea gradient from 6 to 1 m. The proteins were then eluted and dialyzed. In Vitro Pre-mRNA Splicing Assays—Capped, 32P-labeled run-off transcripts were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described (16Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro splicing reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 15 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract as described (16Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 309-314PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1.5 h. RNAs were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with a Kodak 200R Image Station. Splicing ratios were calculated adjusting for the relative length of the spliced and unspliced RNA products. RNA-affinity Chromatography Assays and Nuclear Extract Depletion—Substrate RNAs for RNA-affinity chromatography (RAC) were synthesized utilizing T7 RNA polymerase. RNAs were covalently linked to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose beads as previously described (17Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The beads containing immobilized RNA were incubated in a reaction mixture containing 250 μl of HeLa cell nuclear extract in a final volume of 400 μl (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2). Beads were then washed, and the proteins specifically bound to the immobilized RNA were eluted in 2% SDS, separated on polyacrylamide SDS gels, electroblotted, and probed with antibodies against the following proteins: SR proteins, hnRNP A1, hnRNP K/J, and hnRNP L (provided by Dr. G. Dreyfuss, University of Pennsylvania), SF2/ASF (provided by Dr. A. R. Krainer, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY), SC-35 and 9G8 (provided by Dr. J. Stevenin, INSERM, Strasbourg, France), hnRNP 2H9 (provided by Dr. J. P. Fuchs, INSERM, Strasbourg, France), hnRNP H/H1, hnRNP F, and PTB (provided by Dr. D. L. Black, University of California), and GRSF-1 (provided by Dr. J. Wilusz, Colorado State University). hnRNPs of the H family were depleted from nuclear extracts by RAC utilizing the high affinity RNA oligonucleotide (AGGGA)7 and the control C(AGUC)4AGUCCU(CAGU)3 RNA oligonucleotide. Splicing reaction mixtures containing 250 μl of nuclear extract in a final volume of 400 μl (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm creatine phosphate) were incubated with the RNA-bound beads to deplete >80% of hnRNP H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1. Pull-down Assays—100 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose beads were incubate with variable amounts of histidine-tagged hnRNP F and H for 30 min at 4 °C in 250 ml of incubation buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2). The Ni-NTA beads were washed of unbound hnRNPs and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 250 ml of HeLa nuclear extracts in incubation buffer. Ni-NTA-agarose beads were then washed four times, and the proteins were eluted in 2% SDS, separated on polyacrylamide SDS gels, electroblotted, and probed with specific antibodies. Spliceosome Assembly Reactions—Spliceosome assembly reactions were carried out as previously described (18Das R. Reed R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For assembly of the E complex, pre-mRNAs were incubated in 20-μl splicing reactions lacking ATP and MgCl2. For assembly of the ATP-dependent complexes pre-mRNAs were incubated in nuclear extracts under splicing conditions. Where indicated, 4 μl of 4 mg/ml heparin was added prior to loading on gels. Reactions were loaded on 1.5% low melting point agarose (Invitrogen) gels. The running buffer was 50 mm Tris and 50 mm glycine. Gels were dried down under vacuum at room temperature. Sequence analysis showed that hnRNP H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1 are closely related and that the identity between any two members of the family is between 44 and 96% (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that hnRNPs H, H′, F, and 2H9 assemble on cellular and viral substrates containing the sequence GGGA (19Caputi M. Zahler A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43850-43859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This result was achieved by incubating short substrate RNAs with HeLa nuclear extracts, and proteins specifically bound to the bait RNAs were than eluted and analyzed. This RAC allows for the detection of RNA-protein interactions within functional nuclear extracts that mimic the complex cellular environment. Utilizing this technique we extended our previous observations to define a precise RNA sequence recognized by the members of the hnRNP H family. All the members of the hnRNP H family appear to share similar specificities for the consensus DGGGD sequence (where D is A, G, or U) (Table 1). C residues preceding or following the stretch of three Gs decreased the recruitment of hnRNPs to the substrate. Interestingly, a poly-G stretch constituted by eight Gs recruits hnRNPs H less efficiently than short G stretches (3Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 4Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) interrupted by A or U residues. Thus, although the proteins of this family recognize runs of three or more Gs, residues that flank the G-runs can modulate their binding. Accordingly substrates constituted exclusively by DGGGD repeats (AGGGA7) recruit all the members of the hnRNP H family with the highest efficiency.TABLE 1hnRNP H protein family members assemble onto a consensus DGGGD motif Open table in a new tab Because the RAC assays are performed utilizing nuclear extracts it was unclear whether each hnRNP binds the consensus DGGGD sequence directly or as part of a multiprotein complex. We performed an RAC assay utilizing the single recombinant hnRNP H, F, and 2H9 proteins. The recombinant proteins were recruited to the DGGGD-containing RNA but not to the control sequence (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) indicating that each hnRNP of the H family has the ability to independently bind the consensus sequence. Next we examined the possibility that in native conditions the members of the hnRNP H family interact through protein-protein interaction. To this end we incubated nuclear extracts with the recombinant histidine-tagged hnRNP H and hnRNP F coupled with Ni-NTA-agarose (Fig. 2B). hnRNPs H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1 were pulled down by the resin coupled with hnRNP H (lanes 3 and 4) and hnRNP F (lanes 5 and 6) but not by the resin alone (lane 7). To eliminate the possibility that these proteins were interacting with an intervening RNA, the nuclear extracts have been treated with RNase A. These data are in agreement with previous work showing that hnRNPs H and F have the ability to form heterodimers (7Chou M.Y. Rooke N. Turck C.W. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and suggest that the members of the hnRNP H family form a multiprotein complex. Because recent work has suggested a possible interaction between hnRNPs H and F and other splicing factors (5Han K. Yeo G. An P. Burge C.B. Grabowski P.J. PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Martinez-Contreras R. Fisette J.F. Nasim F.U. Madden R. Cordeau M. Chabot B. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the fraction eluted from the his-tagged hnRNP F and H bound to the Ni-NTA beads was analyzed for the presence of several hnRNPs (A1, K/J, L, and PTB), SR proteins, and spliceosomal components. No proteins other than the members of the hnRNP H family appeared to be associated with the hnRNP H family complex (data not shown). Nevertheless, it is conceivable that interactions between members of the hnRNP H family and other components of the spliceosomal machinery may occur in vivo within the dynamic pre-RNA-spliceosomal complex. To determine the extent to which protein-protein interactions contribute to recruitment of H family members to a substrate RNA incubated with nuclear extracts, we compared the relative amounts of hnRNPs eluted from the his-tagged hnRNP F and H pull-down assays with the ones eluted from the RAC assay. Because the same incubation and washing conditions were utilized for both assays and the amount of his-tagged hnRNP F and H loaded onto the beads was roughly equivalent to the amount of those proteins recovered by the DGGGD-containing RNA (see Fig. 2B blots for hnRNP H and F, lanes 1, 3, and 5) the RNA substrate was ∼6 times more efficient in recruiting the members of the hnRNP H family than the hnRNP H or F Ni-NTA-bound proteins (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Thus, the recruitment of the hnRNP H family members to the agarose (21)-bound RNA is due mainly to direct RNA-protein interactions. To investigate the role of the DGGGD consensus motif in splicing regulation, we utilized the pTat12 substrate, which contains two exons and one intron, and is derived from the HIV-1 tat gene (Fig. 3, A and B). Splicing of the tat gene is regulated by several ESEs and ESSs that have been mapped and characterized (4Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell.

The substrate pTat12 is weakly spliced unless the ESS2, located within tat exon 2, is mutated (pTat12-ESS2M, Fig. 3, A and B). Mutation of the ESS activates splicing by disrupting the binding of hnRNP A1, which, in turn, antagonizes the activity of SR proteins binding to nearby ESE sequences (4Zahler A.M. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Caputi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10077-10084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Amendt B.A. Hesslein D. Chang L.J. Stoltzfus C.M. Mol. Cell.

We mutated the eight DGGGD motifs that are present within the pTat12 and pTat12-Ess2M splicing substrates (Fig. 3B, mutations S1-S8). In vitro splicing reactions were carried out in HeLa nuclear extracts; splicing efficiency was measured as the ratio of spliced versus unspliced RNA. In general, mutations of the G-runs did not increase splicing in the wild-type substrates, with the exception being the mutation of the S8 G-run, which increased splicing efficiency from <0.05 to 0.15 (Fig. 3C, lane 9). The S8 G-run is located within a previously characterized splicing silencer (ESS2p), and it appears to regulate splicing by binding hnRNP A1 and hnRNP H, which decreases accessibility to the upstream 3′ splice site (23Jacquenet S. Mereau A. Bilodeau P.S. Damier L. Stoltzfus C.M. Branlant C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40464-40475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mutation of the G-runs in the pTat12-ESS2M substrates revealed that one of the putative hnRNP H family binding sites, the S3 G-run, is required for efficient splicing. The S3 mutation decreases splicing efficiency from 0.8 to 0.2. Mutations of the other intronic G-runs did not appear to alter splicing efficiency (Fig. 3C, lanes 11, 12, and 17-19). The location of the S3 G-run seems crucial for its activity, because its repositioning just up- or downstream of its original location (Fig. 3B, S3-U and S3-D) did not restore splicing (pTatE12-S3-U and pTatE12-S3-D, Fig. 3C, lanes 15 and 16). Given its location within the HIV-1 genome the S3 G-run could play a role in the regulation of not only the tat gene but other viral genes as well. All HIV-1-spliced mRNAs include the first exon and the 5′ splice site present in the pTat12 construct, referred to as the major 5′ splice site. In the viral genome the S3 G-run is located in close proximity of the major HIV-1 5′ splice site. Thus, the mechanism regulating splicing via the S3 G-run can potentially control the expression of most viral gene products. All the G-runs present within the pTat12-ESS2M substrate have the potential to recruit members of the hnRNPs of the H family. Because splicing is down-regulated by mutation of the S3 G-run, it is conceivable that hnRNPs of the H family can activate splicing of the substrate by binding this specific G-run via imposing spatial and functional constraints in respect to other cis- or trans-acting regulatory elements. Alternatively, it is possible that the S3 mutation impairs the assembly of other factors or disrupts an RNA secondary structure required for proper splicing of the substrate. To further investigate these possibilities, we first confirmed by RAC analysis that recruitment of hnRNP H family members to a short RNA region derived from the splicing substrate is inhibited by the S3 G-run mutation. Fig. 4A shows that hnRNPs H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1 are recruited to the wild type but not to the mutated substrate (lanes 1 and 2). Analysis of the proteins eluted from the substrates indicates that, aside from members of the hnRNP H family, no other factors show altered recruitment in response to the S3 mutation (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Next we sought to determine whether members of the hnRNP H family were required for efficient splicing of the pTat12-ESS2M substrate. HeLa nuclear extracts were depleted from the members of the hnRNP H family by RAC utilizing a high affinity substrate (AGGGA)7 (Fig. 4B). More than 80% of hnRNPs H, H′, F, 2H9, and GRSF-1 were depleted from the extracts, whereas other hnRNPs or essential splicing factors, such as SR proteins, were retained (hnRNP A1, SF2/ASF, and SC35; Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Mock depletions were done by utilizing a control RNA substrate and did not result in the substantial depletion of hnRNPs from the splicing extract (Fig. 4B, lane 3). The pTat12-ESS2M substrate was spliced utilizing the mock depleted (Fig. 4C, lane 1) and hnRNP H family-depleted nuclear extract (Fig. 4C, lanes 2-10). The substrate RNA was spliced efficiently in the mock depleted extract, whereas a splicing product was barely detectable in the depleted extract. Addition of the single recombinants hnRNPs H, F, and 2H9 increased splicing efficiency in the depleted extract, although not to the same level of the mock depleted extract. Higher splicing efficiency was achieved by adding a mixture of hnNRPs H, F, and 2H9 to the depleted extract; nevertheless, splicing activity was not completely restored. This could have been due to the lack of GRSF-1 in the complemented extracts; unfortunately, we were unable to obtain a recombinant plasmid containing the full GRSF-1 sequence. It is also plausible that protein isoforms, other than the ones utilized in the recombination assay, are required to fully restore splicing efficiency. These data indicate that hnRNP H family member assembly at the S3 G-run is required for efficient splicing of the pTat12-ESS2M substrate and that the functions of the members of this protein family in splicing activation are not redundant. Spliceosomal complexes assemble in a stepwise manner in vitro; the nonspecific complex H, which consists of several hnRNP family members, assembles first, and its formation is independent of the presence of functional splice sites. This is followed by formation of the ATP-independent pre-spliceosomal early (E) complex, which requires functional 5′ and 3′ splice sites. The A complex is the first ATP-dependent complex to enter the assembly, followed by the B complex. The two catalytic steps of splicing take place after the final C complex is assembled. To investigate what step was affected by the S3 G-run mutation, we compared spliceosomal complex formation in the substrates pTatE12-ESS2M, pTat12-S3-ESS2M, and pTatE12-ESS2M-5′M. pTatE12-ESS2M-5′M carries a mutation in the 5′ splice site, which prevents the formation of functional pre-spliceosomal complexes, and therefore it is not spliced efficiently (Fig. 5A). The intact 5′ splice site is required for binding of the essential U1 snRNP component of the ATP-independent pre-spliceosomal complex. Analysis of spliceosomal complex formation utilized native agarose gel electrophoresis (18Das R. Reed R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ATP-independent E complex can be identified due to its sensitivity to heparin; as shown in Fig. 5B the E complex is efficiently assembled by pTatE12-ESS2M and pTat12-S3-ESS2M but not by pTatE12-ESS2M-5′M carrying the 5′ splice site mutation, which prevents snRNPU1 binding. In Fig. 5C, we analyzed the formation of the ATP-dependent A, B, and C complexes. A time course shows that the pTat12-ESS2M substrate can assemble the three spliceosomal complexes efficiently. The pTat12-S3-ESS2M substrate shows less A and B complex formation, whereas no C complex can be clearly detected after a longer exposure. The decrease in complex formation correlates with the decrease in splicing efficiency seen in Fig. 3C. Because binding of the members of the hnRNP H family to the S3 G-run was essential for splicing, we sought to determine whether these proteins are required for efficient spliceosomal formation as well. The pTat12-ESS2M substrate was incubated with the hnRNPs H family-depleted and mock depleted nuclear extracts. E complex formation was not inhibited by depletion of the hnRNPs H family (Fig. 5D), whereas the A, B, and C complexes assembled in the mock depleted but not in the hnRNPs H family-depleted extracts (Fig. 5E, lanes 1-8). After a 40-min incubation, only complex A was visible, and its presence might have been due to residual amounts of hnRNP H proteins left in the nuclear extracts after depletion. Reconstitution of the depleted extracts with recombinant hnRNP H proteins showed that a mixture of hnRNPs H, F, and 2H9 could restore formation of spliceosomal complexes A and B, but not C, to a level close to the one obtained with the mock depleted extracts (Fig. 5E, lanes 9-12). These results indicate that members of the hnRNP H family are required for formation of ATP-dependent spliceosomal complexes but not for the ATP-independent E complex. In this work, we studied the roles of the five members of the hnRNP H family in splicing regulation. Previous research has implicated the involvement of hnRNPs H, H′, 2H9, and F in the utilization of both splicing enhancers and silencers, and different models for their functions in splicing regulation have been proposed. Binding of hnRNP H to the 5′ splice site of the NF-1 exon 3 and TSHβ exon 2 has been shown to regulate splicing by restricting the ability of the U1 snRNP to interact with the 5′ splice site (28Buratti E. Baralle M. De Conti L. Baralle D. Romano M. Ayala Y.M. Baralle F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the consensus DGGGD binding motif we characterized can be found at the 5′ splice site of several constitutively spliced exons. Thus, it is unlikely that the interplay between hnRNP H and the U1 snRNP at the 5′ splice site is the sole mechanism regulating splicing of these proteins. Genomic studies have shown that G-runs are found preferentially in intronic sequences immediately flanking the splice sites and appear to facilitate splicing of the intron (29McCullough A.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4562-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Yeo G. Hoon S. Venkatesh B. Burge C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15700-15705Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a recent report proposed that splicing of longer introns could be regulated by a looping-out mechanism in which hnRNP A1 and hnRNPs H/F may function by binding sequences proximal to the 5′ and"

Here we define a family of PH domain proteins, including Tiam1 and ArhGAP9, that demonstrates specificity for PI(4,5)P2, as well as for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, the products of PI 3-kinase.

Crystal structures of the PH domain of ArhGAP9 in complex with the headgroups of Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and Ins(1,3,5)P3 reveal how two adjacent phosphate positions in PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 are accommodated through flipped conformations of the bound phospholipid. We validate the non-canonical site of phosphoinositide interaction by showing that binding pocket mutations, which disrupt phosphoinositide binding in vitro, also disrupt membrane localization of Tiam1 in cells.

Crystal structures of the PH domain of ArhGAP9 in complex with the headgroups of Ins(1,3,4)P3, Ins(1,4,5)P3, and Ins(1,3,5)P3 reveal how two adjacent phosphate positions in PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 are accommodated through flipped conformations of the bound phospholipid. We validate the non-canonical site of phosphoinositide interaction by showing that binding pocket mutations, which disrupt phosphoinositide binding in vitro, also disrupt membrane localization of Tiam1 in cells. We posit that the diversity in PI interaction modes displayed by PH domains contributes to their versatility of use in biological systems. The spatial and temporal regulation of protein localization plays an important role in the transduction of signals between sub-cellular compartments.

De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides are lipid components of cellular membranes that function as signaling molecules. The inositol headgroups of phosphoinositides are differentially phosphorylated, and selectively bound by a variety of protein modules, including PH, FERM, ENTH, FYVE, and PX domains (2DiNitto J.

Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and serve important roles in kinase signaling and cytoskeletal organization (6Lemmon M. Ferguson K. Biochem.

The PI binding properties of PH domains are diverse, ranging from family members that display no detectable interaction to domains that bind one or more headgroups with nanomolar binding affinity (8Yu J.W.

Acta. 2006; 1761: 850-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Generally, PH domains that possess weak affinity for phosphoinositides are inefficient at PI-dependent membrane localization. These PH domains may require multimerization or cooperation with other factors for their targeting function (11Maffucci T. Falasca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Carlton J. Cullen P. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 540-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, PH domains that bind with high affinity and selectivity to either PI(4,5)P2 or the PI 3-kinase products PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 are efficiently targeted to membrane surfaces. The PH domain of PLCδ is a specific sensor of PI(4,5)P2, whereas those of Akt, Btk, and Grp1 exemplify domains that selectively bind with high affinity to PI(3,4)P2 and/or PI(3,4,5)P3 (10DiNitto J. Lambright D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 850-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).A basic consensus motif within the β1-β2 loop region is characteristic of PH domains that bind phosphoinositides with high affinity and specificity (13Isakoff S. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K. Abagyan R. Lemmon M. Aronheim A. Skolnik E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This motif defines the core of the canonical PI binding pocket, and mutations therein disrupt both phosphoinositide binding and membrane localization functions (14Lemmon M. Ferguson K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To date, eight protein crystal structures of PI-bound PH domains demonstrate direct interactions between phosphates on the inositol ring and residues of this phosphoinositide recognition motif (15Lietzke S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Additional interactions with the bound phosphoinositide are contributed by more variable regions of the PH domain, including residues within the β3-β4 and β6-β7 loop regions. This PI-recognition motif has facilitated identification of additional PH domain containing proteins that bind phosphoinositides within the canonical binding pocket (22Dowler S. Currie R. Campbell D. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C. Alessi D. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar).Despite its power in predicting PI-binding properties, the conventional phosphoinositide recognition motif is not apparent in proteins such as Tiam1 that nonetheless require a functional PH domain for membrane localization (23Michiels F. Stam J. Hordijk P. van der Kammen R. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C. Collard J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Tiam1 is a multidomain protein involved in reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton (24Mertens A. Roovers R. Collard J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Tiam1 contains a DH-PH region with guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity specific for Rac1 (25Michiels F. Habets G. Stam J. van der Kammen R. Collard J. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal PH domain (PHn) of Tiam1 is required for localization to the plasma membrane through its apparent binding preference for PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(4,5)P2 ligands (23Michiels F.

J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The unique PI-binding profile displayed by Tiam1, together with the absence of sequence motifs characteristic of PH domains that bind phosphoinositides with high affinity and selectivity, suggests a novel mode of phospholipid recognition. Here we show that the PH domain of Tiam1 is representative of a larger subfamily of PH domains that share similar lipid binding preferences and bind phosphoinositides through a non-canonical mechanism related to that employed by the PH domain of β-spectrin. Strikingly, structural analysis of one subfamily member, the ArhGAP9 PH domain, shows that its PI-binding properties are expanded by the ability to recognize distinct ligands in flipped orientations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruct Generation—Murine TIAM1 constructs C1199 and C1199ΔPH in the vector pEGFP were obtained from Peter Downes (U. Dundee, UK). Point mutations of R459A and R460A within the PHn domain were generated by QuikChange PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PHn (aa 432-553) and PHn-cc-Ex (aa 432-669) fragments of wild-type and RR/AA Tiam1 were subcloned into modified pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) and pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs) vectors for bacterial expression. The PH domain (residues 1-122) of human PKBα/AKT1 was cloned into pMAL-C2. The PH domain of human ArhGAP9 (aa 321-440) was amplified by PCR from cDNA (MGC:12959) and subcloned into pGEX-2T and pMAL-C2. Site-specific mutants of AG9 were generated by QuikChange PCR and verified by DNA sequencing.Protein Expression and Purification—The GST-AG9 PH fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus cells by addition of 0.25 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to cultures at A600 = 0.6 for 15 h at 18 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and sonicated in the presence of 10 μg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Filtered supernatant applied to a glutathione-Sepharose column was eluted with 25 mm reduced glutathione. The PH domain was cleaved from GST by incubation with thrombin (200 units, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Following dialysis in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, AG9 was further purified by anion exchange on HiTrap Q HP (Amersham Biosciences) and size exclusion chromatography over Superdex-75 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing the PH domain were concentrated to 12-14 mg/ml and stored at -70 °C.The maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins MBP-TIAM1 PHn, MBP-Tiam1 PHn-cc-Ex, MBP-Akt, and MBP-AG9, and point mutants thereof were expressed per GST-AG9 as above except the bacterial cell supernatant was applied to amylose resin (New England Biolabs). MBP proteins were eluted with 20 mm maltose, concentrated, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography over a Superdex S200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, concentrated, and stored at -70 °C.Phosphoinositide Binding Assay—PI-binding affinities were determined by a fluorescence polarization-based assay. The phosphoinositide ligands possess short C6-acyl chains with a fluorescent moiety, BODIPY TMR-X, covalently linked through the carboxylic acid of one acyl chain, distal to the phosphate-binding determinants on the inositol ring (Invitrogen). Increasing concentrations of purified protein were added to 12.5 nm fluorescent phosphoinositide in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Following 20-min incubation at room temperature, anisotropy measurements of 100-μl samples were taken at 21 °C using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization instrument. Polarization filters were selected that matched the excitation and emission spectra (542 nm/574 nm, respectively) for the TMR-X fluorescence label. Binding curves and dissociation constants from a minimum of four independent experiments were determined using the GraphPad Prism software (Graph-Pad Software Inc.).Tiam1 Subcellular Localization—HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 .2 × 105 cells were seeded onto coverslips in a 6-well plate, and polyethyleneimine-mediated transfection was performed with GFP-Tiam1 wt, ΔPH, and RR/AA mutants. Cells were fixed 24 h later in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were visualized using a Leica DM IRE2 fluorescence microscope. Images were representative of numerous fields and at least three independent transfections.Western Blotting—Transfected HEK 293T cells expressing GFP-Tiam1, ΔPH, and RR/AA mutants (as above) were lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were then probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies (ab290, Abcam) followed by a goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). The proteins were then detected using ECL SuperSignal (Pierce).Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Crystals of the AG9 PH domain were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops obtained by mixing 1 μl of a solution containing 0.5-0.8 mm protein and 1 mm Ins(1,4,5)P3, Ins(1,3,4)P3, or Ins(1,3,5)P3 with 0.5 ml of a reservoir solution containing 20-26% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals of AG9 bound to each inositol headgroup appeared within 1-3 days and were frozen in cryoprotectant consisting of 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol. AG9145 crystallized in the space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 41.5 Å, b = 95.1 Å, c = 29.7 Å (Table 3). Diffraction data from a single crystal in a liquid nitrogen cryostream at 100 K was collected to 1.8-Å resolution at APS beamline 14-BMD and processed using HKL2000 (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar). AG9134 crystals have P212121 symmetry and unit cell dimensions of a = 29.2 Å, b = 36.9 Å, c = 113.3 Å.

Crystals of AG9135 have P212121 symmetry with unit cell dimensions of a = 28.8 Å, b = 36.6 Å, c = 113.7 Å. Diffraction data to 1.9-Å resolution was collected at APS beamline 14-BMC and processed using HKL2000.TABLE 3Data collection and refinement statistics for ArhGAP9 PH domainAG9145AG9134AG9135Data collectionBeamlineAPS 14-BMDAPS 14-IDBAPS 14-BMCWavelength (Å)0.92021.127140.90020Space groupP21212P212121P212121Unit cell41.52 95.16 29.7128.92 36.55 112.0228.75 36.60 113.71Resolution (Å)1.811.91.90Reflections total/unique137,924/11,480132,389/9,92153,912/9,333Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.99.2 (93.6)99.4 (99.3)93.1 (91.3)Rsym (%)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.,bRmerge = ∑h∑i|I(h,i) - 〈I(h) 〉|/∑h∑iI(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of h and <I(h)> is the corresponding average value for all i measurements.0.048 (0.361)0.044 (0.225)0.055 (0.291)<I/σ>aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.46.8 (4.5)12.6 (3.3)24.6 (5.1)RefinementResolution range (Å)30-1.8130-1.920-1.90Reflections (work/test)10,652/5349,443/4769,773/484Rwork/Rfree (%)cRwork and Rfree = ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo| for the working set and test set (5%) of reflections.19.1/22.019.2/25.022.4/23.8Protein atoms860914921Water molecules768648r.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.0100.0080.010r.m.s.d. bond angles (deg)1.471.161.30Average B-factors (Å2)Protein20.219.422.8Phosphoinositide16.324.334.1Water30.030.632.9Ramachandran plotMost favored regions (%)93.591.892.9Allowed regions (%)6.58.27.1Disallowed regions (%)000a Values in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.b Rmerge = ∑h∑i|I(h,i) - 〈I(h) 〉|/∑h∑iI(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of h and <I(h)> is the corresponding average value for all i measurements.c Rwork and Rfree = ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑|Fo| for the working set and test set (5%) of reflections.

Final statistics for each AG9 structure are listed in Table 3.RESULTSTiam1 PHn Region Recognizes a Unique Profile of Phosphoinositides—To better characterize the PI-binding specificity of the Tiam1 PH domain, we quantitated the affinity of its isolated N-terminal PH domain against a comprehensive panel of different phosphoinositide isoforms. Because a region of Tiam1 immediately C-terminal to PHn, termed cc-Ex, is additionally required for efficient membrane targeting in cells (36Stam J. Sander E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F. Kain H. van der Kammen R. Collard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we also characterized the PI-binding specificity of a larger PH domain construct. For this purpose, the minimal PHn domain of Tiam1 (aa 432-553) and an extended fragment, including the PH domain and adjacent cc-Ex region (aa 432-669), were expressed in E. coli as MBP fusions, purified, and tested for PI binding using a fluorescence polarization-based assay. For solubility purposes, we employed phosphoinositides with short C6-acyl chains covalently linked to the fluorescent BODIPY-TMR moiety (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).As shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1, Tiam1 PHn and PHn-cc-Ex bound phosphoinositides with a strong preference for PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(4,5)P2. Both constructs displayed significantly reduced binding affinities for PI(3,5)P2 (Table 1) and for monophosphate inositol species (data not shown). PHn-cc-Ex displayed greater overall affinity for phosphoinositides (∼4-fold for each species tested) as compared with PHn (Table 1). This may reflect the fact that the isolated PHn domain is prone to aggregation. The preference of the Tiam1 PHn domain for PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(4,5)P2 over other phosphoinositides, as quantified in these experiments, is in agreement with previously determined qualitative lipid overlay studies (27Fleming I. Gray A. Downes C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our quantitative measurements also reveals that both Tiam1 constructs displayed a small preference for PI(3,4,5)P3 over PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2. This PI binding profile is very different from that of the Akt PH domain, which exhibits a well established preference for PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 (Fig. 1C and Table 1), and from the PH domain of PLCδ, which exclusively binds PI(4,5)P2 (10DiNitto J. Lambright D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 850-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We considered that the unique PI binding profile of Tiam1 might reflect a variation of the Akt/PLCδ PH domain lipid-binding mode, or alternatively the use of an entirely distinct PI-binding mechanism.TABLE 1Dissociation constants of TIAM1 PH domain constructs for phosphoinositidesMBP fusion protein constructIns(3,4,5)P3Ins(3,4)P2Ins(4,5)P2Ins(3,5)P2InositolμmTiam1-(432-669)a± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Tiam1 Belongs to a Class of Spectrin-like PH Domains—Sequence alignment (Fig. 2) revealed that Tiam1 PHn lacks the β1-β2 linker motif, Lys-Xn-Lys/Arg-X-Arg, characteristic of high affinity binding PH domains such as Akt, Btk, Grp1, and PLCδ (13Isakoff S.

Tiam1, however, shares five of seven PI-interacting residues identified in a crystal structure of the spectrin-β2 PH domain in complex with the inositol headgroup of PI(4,5)P2 (37Hyvonen M. Macias M. Nilges M. Oschkinat H. Saraste M. Wilmanns M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4676-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The PH domain of spectrin employs a non-canonical PI-binding mechanism mediated by two short sequence elements, Lys-Xn-Arg-Ser-Trp and Tyr-X-Lys within the β1-β2 and β5-β6 loop regions, respectively. To date, no other PH domain has been shown to bind phosphoinositides using a spectrin-like mechanism.FIGURE 2Structure-based sequence alignment of PH domains. Sequences are grouped according to conservation of residues within the non-canonical spectrin-like (upper list) and canonical Akt/Btk/PLCγ-like binding pockets (lower list). Secondary structure elements of the AG9 PH domain are indicated in green with corresponding sequences of all PH domains highlighted below in yellow and highly conserved basic residues colored blue.

Phosphoinositide binding residues within the β1-β2, β3-β4, and β6-β7 loop regions of Akt1 (PDB: 1H10), DAPP1 (PDB: 1FAO), PEPP1 (PDB: 1UPR), Grp1 (PDB: 1FHX and 1FGY), ARNO (PDB: 1U27), Btk (PDB: 1B55), PDK1 (PDB: 1W1D), and PLCδ (PDB: 1MAI) are indicated with blue boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if a spectrin-like binding pocket within the Tiam1 PHn domain is responsible for its ability to preferentially bind both PI(4,5)P2 and the PI 3-kinase products PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2, we mutated spectrin-conserved residues within Tiam1 and tested their effect on PI-binding function. We substituted both Arg-459 and Arg-460 with alanine (denoted Tiam-RR/AA) within the β1-β2 loop region of Tiam1 for this propose. A mutant form of the Tiam1 PHn-cc-Ex region was purified and PI-binding activity was compared with the wild-type protein. Tiam-RR/AA demonstrated a 25- to 65-fold reduction in binding affinity for each phosphoinositide examined (Fig. 3, A-D, and Table 1). During purification by size exclusion chromatography, Tiam-RR/AA eluted at the same volume as wild-type Tiam1 suggesting the mutant protein was fully folded (data not shown).FIGURE 3Mutational analysis of PI-binding residues in Tiam1. The binding of BODIPY-labeled phosphoinositides to MBP-Tiam1-(432-669) (WT) and the R459A/R460A (RR/AA) point mutant was measured by fluorescence polarization. Binding curves for wt (blue, ▪) and RR/AA mutant (red, ▴) proteins were determined for PI(3,4,5)P3 (A), PI(3,4)P2 (B), PI(4,5)P2 (C), and PI ligands (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To assess the effect of spectrin-like binding pocket mutations on Tiam1 membrane localization in cells, the same RR/AA mutant was generated in the context of full-length Tiam1. GFP-tagged versions of wild-type and Tiam1 mutants were examined for membrane localization in HEK-293T cells. An internal deletion that removes the entire PHn domain and disrupts membrane localization in NIH-3T3 cells was also tested as a negative localization control (27Fleming I. Gray A. Downes C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Wild-type GFP-Tiam1 expression was most prominent at the boundary between cells with actin-rich protrusions (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1A). As previously reported (27Fleming I. Gray A. Downes C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38TenKlooster J. Evers E. Janssen L. Machesky L. Michiels F. Hordijk P. Collard J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), deletion of the entire PHn domain (ΔPH) of Tiam1 resulted in diffuse cytoplasmic staining with greatly reduced actin-rich protrusions (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S1A). Consistent with a loss of PI-binding function, the Tiam-RR/AA mutant was predominantly diffuse within the cell (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the extent of actin-rich protrusions extended by cells expressing the RR/AA point mutations was not significantly reduced relative to wild-type Tiam1 (supplemental Fig. S1A). In addition, unlike the PH deletion that demonstrated a significant reduction of Rac1 activation, the RR/AA mutation activated Rac1 to similar levels as wild-type Tiam1 (supplemental Fig. S1B). Both wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed to equivalent levels as determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4D). These results suggest the intact Tiam1 PH domain may contribute phosphoinositide-independent functions such as mediating a direct interaction with the Arp2/3 complex (38TenKlooster J. Evers E. Janssen L. Machesky L. Michiels F. Hordijk P. Collard J. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on our mutational studies, we conclude that a spectrin-like binding pocket of Tiam1 is responsible for high affinity and selective phosphoinositide binding and for the proper localization of the Tiam1 protein in cells.FIGURE 4A non-canonical pocket within the Tiam1 PHn domain is required for membrane localization.

https://openalex.org/W2030618676,"IRAK-4 is an essential component of the signal transduction complex downstream of the IL-1- and Toll-like receptors. Although regarded as the first kinase in the signaling cascade, the role of IRAK-4 kinase activity versus its scaffold function is still controversial. To investigate the role of IRAK-4 kinase function in vivo, “knock-in” mice were generated by replacing the wild type IRAK-4 gene with a mutant gene encoding kinase-deficient IRAK-4 protein (IRAK-4 KD). IRAK-4 kinase was rendered inactive by mutating the conserved lysine residues in the ATP pocket essential for coordinating ATP. Analyses of embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages obtained from IRAK-4 KD mice demonstrate lack of cellular responsiveness to stimulation with IL-1β or a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist. IRAK-4 kinase deficiency prevents the recruitment of IRAK-1 to the IL-1 receptor complex and its subsequent phosphorylation and degradation. IRAK-4 KD cells are severely impaired in NFκB, JNK, and p38 activation in response to IL-1β or TLR7 ligand. As a consequence, IL-1 receptor/TLR7-mediated production of cytokines and chemokines is largely absent in these cells. Additionally, microarray analysis identified IL-1β response genes and revealed that the induction of IL-1β-responsive mRNAs is largely ablated in IRAK-4 KD cells. In summary, our results suggest that IRAK-4 kinase activity plays a critical role in IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)/TLR7-mediated induction of inflammatory responses.

IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), 4The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; IRAK, IL-1R-associated kinase; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TIR, Toll/IL-1R; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; ES, embyronic stem; WT, wild type; RT, reverse transcription; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; KD, kinase-deficient; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. IL-18 receptor (IL-18R), and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important mediators of innate immune responses (1Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). The signaling cascades initiated by these receptors are involved in host defense mechanisms, fever induction, acute and chronic inflammation, obesity, and immune modulation. IL-1β-mediated activation of IL-1R leads to induction of cellular signaling pathways, involving a cascade of adaptor molecules, kinases, and transcription factors. Although IL-1R and TLRs exhibit structurally distinct extracellular domains, they share an intracellular Toll/IL-1R (TIR) homology domain essential for interactions with downstream signaling components (2Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the IL-1R triggers engagement of the IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RacP) followed by binding of the intracellular adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) via interactions of TIR domains. This leads to recruitment of IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs), IRAK-4, IRAK-1, and tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to the receptor complex (3Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 4Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). As a consequence, IRAK-1 is phosphorylated (5Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 6Kollewe C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylated IRAK-1 together with TRAF6 leaves the receptor complex and interacts with the transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) multiprotein signalosome (8Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this new complex triggers induction of downstream signaling events, including IκB kinases (IKKs), p38, and Jun-N-terminal kinases (JNK) (9Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), leading to activation of transcription factors such as NFκB and AP-1. These transcription factors are involved in control of expression of many pro-inflammatory genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and proteolytic enzymes (10Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar, 11Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). As TLRs also signal via TIR domains, their signaling is entirely or in part dependent upon IRAK-4 (12Takeda K. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). IRAK-4 has been reported to be pivotal for IL-1R-, IL-18R-, and TLR-induced signaling (13Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 503-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Analysis of IRAK-4-deficient mice (-/-) revealed that IRAK-4 is essential for mediating the majority of innate immune responses (14Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from IRAK-4-/- mice exhibit severe defects in cellular signaling in response to IL-1β and TLRs ligands, namely suppression of IκBα degradation and NFκB activation and inhibition of c-Jun and p38 phosphorylation. Consequently, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), is reduced. The animals that lack IRAK-4 also fail to produce cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide challenge (14Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In addition, these mice are sensitive to bacterial infections. Recently, patients with recurrent infections and devoid of IRAK-4 protein due to gene mutations have been described (15Medvedev A.E. Thomas K. Awomoyi A. Kuhns D.B. Gallin J.I. Li X. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 6587-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Picard C. Puel A. Bonnet M. Ku C.L. Bustamante J. Yang K. Soudais C. Dupuis S. Feinberg J. Fieschi C. Elbim C. Hitchcock R.

Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Ozinsky A. Casanova J.L. Science. 2003; 299: 2076-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Their phenotype is reminiscent of the phenotype observed in mice devoid of TLR signaling in regard to increased susceptibility for bacterial infections. Although the crucial function of IRAK-4 protein in signaling has been demonstrated, controversial data exist concerning the nature of its kinase activity. On one hand, reconstitution of mouse-derived IRAK-4-/- cells with kinase-inactive IRAK-4 has been insufficient to rescue IL-1β-induced activation of NFκB and JNK as compared with overexpression of wild type IRAK-4 (17Lye E. Mirtsos C. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40653-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This implies that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 is a key requirement for the optimal transduction of IL-1β-induced signals and production of inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, similar experiments, but using human IRAK-4-/- cells derived from IRAK-4-deficient patients, have demonstrated that IRAK-4 kinase-inactive mutant effectively restored IL-1β-mediated signaling, suggesting that IRAK-4 acts more as an adaptor protein rather than an essential kinase (18Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26748-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The latter finding is reminiscent of the observation that IRAK-1, a kinase similar in structure and also present in the signaling complex together with IRAK-4 and MyD88, does not require its kinase activity for signal transduction (19Knop J. Martin M.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Maschera B. Ray K. Burns K. Volpe F. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As it is thought that IRAK-4 phosphorylates IRAK-1 (5Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 6Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) to activate IRAK-1 kinase, the concept of an essential role of the kinase activity of IRAK-4 in TIR domain-mediated signaling is not obvious. To clarify the biochemical function of IRAK-4 kinase, we have generated genetically engineered mice expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of this protein (IRAK-4 KD). MEFs and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) isolated from these mice were characterized for their ability to respond to stimulation via the IL-1R or TLR7. Our analysis demonstrated that IRAK-4 kinase activity is crucial for IL-1R- and TLR7-mediated signaling and expression of pro-inflammatory genes in these cells. Additionally, we identified a set of genes whose expression is dependent upon the presence of IRAK-4 kinase activity. Generation of IRAK-4 KD Mice—To generate a targeting construct for homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, the mouse IRAK-4 genomic sequence spanning the region from intron 4 to intron 6 (Ensembl ID: ENS-MUSG00000059883) was amplified and subcloned into vector pRAY2 (accession number U63120). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to change K213A,K214A in exon 5. The targeting plasmid was transfected into ES cells from Balb/c mice. Transfected ES cells were selected for neomycin resistance. Homologous recombination was identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern hybridization. The loxP-flanked neomycin cassette was eliminated by co-expression of Cre recombinase. The neomycin-sensitive ES cell clones were amplified and analyzed by PCR and Southern blot. ES cells with homologous recombination were injected into C57Bl/6 host blastocysts. Germline transmission in F1 heterozygous offspring was verified by PCR analysis, and F1 heterozygotes were interbred to obtain homozygous mutant mice. F2 animals were genotyped by PCR using two sets of primers IRAK4/IRAK4 AA and IRAK4/IRAK4 KK (IRAK4, 5′-TTGAGCAGATGTCAGTCATGGA-3′; IRAK4 KK, 5′-TTACCGCTCCGAGCTTCTTC-3′; IRAK4 AA, 5′-TTACCGCTCCGAGCGCCG-3′). Cell Culture—Wild type (WT) and IRAK-4 KD MEFs isolated from Balb/c mice were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Amimed Produkte AG) at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. BMDMs were isolated as described previously (21Comalada M. Xaus J. Valledor A.F. Lopez-Lopez C. Pennington D.J. Celada A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C1235-C1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and maintained in macrophage-SFM medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 30% L-929R-cell-conditioned medium as a source of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. IRAK-4-/- BMDM were derived from respective mice described by Suzuki et al. (14Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The plasmids IL-6 and IL-6 (-AP1) were obtained by inserting the PCR-amplified -495 and -225 bp, respectively, human IL-6 promoter fragments into the HindIII/XhoI-digested pGL4.14 luciferase vector (Promega). The IL-6 (-NFκB) construct was made by site-directed mutagenesis on the IL-6 plasmid using an oligonucleotide mutated in the consensus NFκB binding site (5′-AATGTAATATTTTCCCATG-3′, underlined are mutated nucleotides) and QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The NFκB promoter plasmid was constructed by inserting five repeats of the NFκB consensus binding site into NheI/BglII of pGL4.14. The pRL-SV40 plasmid was obtained from Promega. Transfection-based Reporter Gene Assays—MEF cells were seeded in 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Transfections of 1 μg/well of one of the pGL4.14 plasmids were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the standard protocol. In each transfection, 10 ng of pRL-SV40 was added. The cells were then serum-starved overnight and subsequently stimulated with 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β or 10 ng/ml TNFα for 8 h. Cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo LabSystems). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—MEF or BMDM cells were plated, and 24 h later, the cultures were serum-starved for 5 h and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β (R&D Systems) or 10 ng/ml TNFα (human recombinant TNFα produced within Novartis Pharma AG) or 0.5 μg/ml resiquimod (R-848; Alexis Corp.) and harvested in standard Laemmli buffer. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation analyses were carried out as described previously (22Davis C.N. Tabarean I. Gaidarova S. Behrens M.M. Bartfai T. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 1379-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were done by standard procedures as described elsewhere (23Lane H.A. Beuvink I. Motoyama A.B. Daly J.M. Neve R.M. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3210-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and signals were detected by chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The IRAK-4 antibody was purchased from ProSci Inc., the IL-1RI antibody was from R&D Systems, the IRAK-1 and IL-1RI antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., and antibodies to IκBα, phospho-NFκB p65 (Ser-536), phospho-SEK1/MKK4 (Thr-261), phospho-stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) (3D7), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and p44/42 MAPK were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Gene Expression Analysis Using DNA Microarrays—MEF cell cultures were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β (R&D Systems). Total RNA was prepared from duplicate samples according to the Qiagen RNeasy protocol (Qiagen). Total RNA was converted to biotin-labeled cRNA according to the NuGEN Ovation protocol (NuGEN Technologies). After purification with Qiagen RNeasy spin columns and chemical fragmentation, the cRNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix). Hybridization, washing, and staining of the microarrays were done according to Affymetrix standard protocols. The arrays were scanned using an Agilent Technologies GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Agilent Technologies), and the images were converted to expression values using the Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 software. Further data analysis was done on per chip normalized expression values using the Silicon Genetics software GeneSpring (version 7.2). When searching for genes with relevant expression profiles, only those probe sets that had absolute expression calls of “Present” in both duplicates of at least one of the conditions examined were taken into consideration. A further requirement was that the duplicate average had to reach an expression value of at least 0.5 in at least one of the conditions examined (chip normalization was to a trimmed average of 1.0). The resulting initial gene lists were further analyzed by filtering for -fold change differences as appropriate. The array data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus at National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with GEO accession number GSE6789. Quantitative RT-PCR—MEFs were treated, and RNA was prepared as above. cDNA was synthesized using 750 ng of total RNA samples with the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). PCR was done using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen). 2 μl of diluted cDNA (in three serial dilutions; 1:5, 1:15, and 1:45) were used for each PCR in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. Each primer was used at 200 nm. The PCR was run on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) with the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min hold (uracil-DNA-glycosylase incubation), 95 °C for 2 min hold, 95 °C, 3 s, and 60 °C, 30 s (40 cycles). The assays were run using the absolute quantification profile (standard curve) in the 7500 Fast System SDS software. The three serial dilutions of the non-stimulated WT cDNA were used with arbitrary copy numbers to create the standard curve. The following primers were used: for IRAK-4, 5′-CCTGGATGTCCTGGAACTTG-3′ and 5′-CAACACGCAGTAGGCAGAGA-3′; for Ccl2, 5′-TGGCTCAGCCAGATGCAGTTA-3′ and 5′-TGCTGCTGGTGATCCTCTTGT; for Ccl7, 5′-TGCTGCTCATAGCCGCTGCTT-3′ and 5′-CCGACTACTGGTGATCCTTCT-3′; for Cxcl1, 5′-AATGAGCTGCGCTGTCAGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTCGCGACCATTCTTGAGT-3′; for IκBζ, 5′-CTGCATGTCTGTGCGGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GAGTCAGGCCATCATAGTTCG-3′; for Fos, 5′-GGGCAAAGTAGAGCAGCTATC-3′ and 5′-CTCCGCTTGGAGTGTATCTGT-3′; for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-AGGTTGTCTCCTGCGACTTC-3′ and 5′-ACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAG-3′; for IL-10, 5′-GCTGAGGCGCTGTCATCGATT-3′ and 5′-CATGGCCTTGTAGACACCTTG-3′; for IL-6, Mm_IL6_1_SG QuantiTect Primer Assay (Qiagen catalog number QT00098875). Cytokine Analysis—MEF or BMDM cells were seeded in 12-well plates. The following day, cells were serum-starved for 5 h before stimulation with 1 ng/ml mouse IL-1β (R&D Systems). After the indicated periods of time, supernatant was collected, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation (14 000 × g, 1 min). For detection of secreted IL-6, TNFα, Ccl2, and Cxcl1, cellular supernatants were analyzed using the Bio-Plex cytokine assay method (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Kinase Activity of IRAK-4 Is Essential for IL-1β-mediated Signaling Pathways—To investigate the physiological role of IRAK-4 kinase activity, “knock-in” mice were generated by replacing the WT gene with a gene containing a mutation in the IRAK-4 kinase domain (Fig. 1A). The previously described K213A,K214A mutation replaces two conserved lysine residues in the ATP binding site that are essential for the hydrolysis of ATP (5Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 24Zheng J. Knighton D.R. ten Eyck L.F. Karlsson R. Xuong N. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This mutation abolishes IRAK-4 kinase activity without affecting other protein features, namely interaction with the receptor complex via MyD88 adaptor protein (5Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The genotype of mice carrying this mutation in the IRAK-4 gene was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B), and the respective homozygous mutant mice (IRAK-4 KD) were used in further studies. IRAK-4 KD mice were viable and reproduced as WT mice. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the presence of IRAK-4 mRNA in equal amounts in MEF, BMDM, and spleen cells isolated from both WT and IRAK-4 KD mice (Fig. 1C). To determine the effect of IRAK-4 kinase deficiency on the signaling pathways, analysis of receptor complex formation, expression, and phosphorylation of signaling components in response to cytokine stimulation were performed on cellular extracts of MEFs isolated from WT and IRAK-4 KD mice. The analyses clearly demonstrated that the absence of IRAK-4 kinase activity affected the IL-1β-induced pathways. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that IRAK-1 protein interacts with IRAK-4 in both cell lines, even in non-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2A). However, IL-1β promotes increased binding of IRAK-1 to IRAK-4 only in WT but not IRAK-4 KD MEFs. Additionally, the phosphorylated higher molecular weight form and decreased protein levels of IRAK-1 occurred exclusively in WT MEFs as opposed to IRAK-4 KD MEFs upon IL-1β stimulation (Figs. 2A and 3A). Thus, only hyperphosphorylated IRAK-1, present in WT cells, could stably interact with IL-1RI (Fig. 2B). Further, the degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of p65 NFκB did not occur in IRAK-4 KD MEFs but was apparent in WT MEFs (Fig. 3A). Similarly, phosphorylation of the other IL-1β-induced signaling molecules of the MAPK pathway, namely MKK4, JNK, and p38, was absent only in IRAK-4 KD MEFs. On the other hand, IL-1β-stimulated protein kinase B (PKB) and ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation was induced equally in both WT and IRAK-4 KD cells, suggesting IRAK-4 kinase-independent regulation of these pathways downstream of IL-1R (Fig. 3B). As expected, the TNFα pathway was not affected by the kinase deficiency of IRAK-4 (Fig. 3, C and 3D).FIGURE 3Effect of IRAK-4 kinase deficiency on IL-1β- and TNFα-mediated signaling. WT and IRAK-4 KD MEF cells were left untreated or stimulated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) (A and B) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) (C and D), and cell lysates were prepared after the indicated periods of time. Protein levels were assayed by immunoblotting with IRAK-4, IRAK-1, and IκBα-specific antibodies. The phosphorylation status of p65 NFκB(NFκB_P), MKK4 (MKK4_P), JNK (JNK_P), p38 (p38_P), protein kinase B (PKB_P), and ERK1/2 (ERK1/2_P) was evaluated by immunoblotting with phosphopeptide-specific antibodies. Equivalent loading was confirmed by reprobing with anti-ERK1/2 antibody. The results are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Kinase Activity of IRAK-4 Is Important for IL-1β-mediated Transcriptional Regulation—Immunoblot analysis showed that IL-1β-mediated NFκB activation was absent in IRAK-4 KD MEFs. To further examine the consequences of disrupting this activity, we compared the responsiveness of the NFκB reporter gene to different stimuli in WT and IRAK-4 KD MEFs. The activation of the promoter by both IL-1β and TNFα via the NFκB element was apparent in WT cells (Fig. 4A). However, the kinase deficiency of IRAK-4 prevented IL-1β-mediated, but not TNFα-mediated, stimulation of the promoter. These data confirmed that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 is essential for NFκB induction and that the effect we observed is specific for IL-1β-stimulated pathways. IL-6 cytokine is known to be one of the main targets of IL-1β-mediated NFκB-dependent transcriptional regulation (25Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore the induction of the IL-6 reporter gene was also assessed in both WT and IRAK-4 KD MEFs (Fig. 4B). In these experiments, wild type IL-6 promoter (-495 bp) as well as different mutants were analyzed. The results showed that IL-1β only significantly activated the IL-6 promoter when the kinase activity of IRAK-4 was intact. Furthermore, the functional mutation of NFκB or deletion of AP-1 elements inhibited IL-6 gene transcription in both WT and IRAK-4 KD MEFs, indicating that both elements are essential in regulation downstream of IRAK-4 kinase activity. IRAK-4 KD Affects Expression of Pro-inflammatory Genes— Based on the fact that IL-1β-induced transcriptional activity was disrupted in IRAK-4 KD MEFs, we anticipated that RNA expression of IL-1β-induced genes will also be affected. To identify these genes, we performed a cDNA microarray experiment. After 1 h of IL-1β stimulation as compared with no treatment, expression of 41 genes and expressed sequence tags was induced at least 5-fold in WT cells. In contrast, in IRAK-4 KD cells, 36 of these genes were not induced at all or had a minor increase in expression, less than 50% of WT induction (Fig. 5A and supplemental Table 1). The other five IL-1β-stimulated genes were affected to lesser extend in IRAK-4 KD. Interestingly, the strongly affected genes belong to a group encoding proteins with known relevance to inflammation, including cytokines (IL-6, Lif), chemokines (Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl5, Ccl2, Ccl7, Ccl20), receptors (interferon γ receptor 1 (IFNγR1)), other signaling molecules (Gem, Rasa2, Rgs16, Map3k8, IκBα, TNFaip3, Pde4b, Plscr1), transcription factors (Atf3, Irf1, IκBζ, FosB), and mRNA stability regulators (Zfp36). Also, NFκB-dependent anti-apoptotic Birc3 and Btg2 were not induced in IRAK-4 KD cells in contrast to WT cells. Moreover, expression of a further 54, mainly pro-inflammatory, genes was strongly elevated in WT but not in IRAK-4 KD cells after prolonged IL-1β stimulation, measured at 4 h (supplemental Table 2). To validate the results of microarray hybridization in independent samples, quantitative PCR analyses were performed on six representative mRNAs identified by microarray. IL-6, Cxcl1, Ccl2, Ccl7, IκBζ, and Fos mRNA expression levels in response to IL-1β stimulation, detected by PCR analysis (Fig. 5B), were similar to those observed in microarray experiments (Fig. 5A and supplemental Tables 1 and 2). It is noteworthy that most of the mRNAs appeared not at all or only marginally induced in IRAK-4 KD MEFs at later time points after IL-1β stimulation, whereas e.g. the Ccl7 mRNA was significantly elevated starting at 2 h of stimulation. Additionally, PCR analyses of expression of Fos mRNA showed that early induced genes, identified in microarray experiment as insignificantly affected in IRAK-4 KD cells, in fact show a considerable difference in expression between WT and IRAK-4 KD when measured at earlier time point. Thus, all these RNA expression analyses allowed us to identify a number of genes whose expression is IRAK-4 kinase activity-regulated. To confirm results obtained from mRNA quantification, protein levels of IL-6, Cxcl1, and Ccl2 were measured in the supernatants of IL-1β-stimulated cell cultures (Fig. 6A). As expected, the production of these cytokines was significantly up-regulated in WT MEFs. However, the kinase deficiency of IRAK-4 dramatically reduced the protein expression of these cytokines. The kinase deficiency of IRAK-4 did not affect the TNFα-activated cytokine production (Fig. 6B). Taken together, all these analyses demonstrate that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 is essential for the IL-1β-mediated production of most of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in MEFs. The IRAK-4 Kinase Activity Regulates Signaling Pathways Downstream of TLR7—Macrophages are reactive to microbial products that activate pro-inflammatory responses via TLR-mediated signaling. Individual TLRs transduce signals via divergent pathways: MyD88-dependent pathways, highly similar to the IL-1β-mediated pathway, or/and MyD88-independent pathways (1Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). As IRAK-1/4-mediated signaling is confined to the MyD88-dependent pathway, we assessed the role of IRAK-4 kinase activity in TLR-mediated signaling using resiquimod, a known inducer of TLR7, that signals only via MyD88-dependent pathway (1Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). Stimulation of TLR7 in WT cells led to activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways, reflected by a decrease in levels of IRAK-1 and IκBα, and an increase in JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7). Conversely, these effects were significantly abolished in IRAK-4 KD and IRAK-4-/-"
https://openalex.org/W1982604124,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid produced by sphingosine kinase (SphK1 and 2). We previously showed that S1P receptors (S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3) are expressed in hepatic myofibroblasts (hMF), a population of cells that triggers matrix remodeling during liver injury. Here we investigated the function of these receptors in the wound healing response to acute liver injury elicited by carbon tetrachloride, a process that associates hepatocyte proliferation and matrix remodeling. Acute liver injury was associated with the induction of S1P2, S1P3, SphK1, and SphK2 mRNAs and increased SphK activity, with no change in S1P1 expression. Necrosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte regeneration were similar in S1P2-/- and wild-type (WT) mice. However, compared with WT mice, S1P2-/- mice displayed reduced accumulation of hMF, as shown by lower induction of smooth muscle alpha-actin mRNA and lower induction of TIMP-1, TGF-beta1, and PDGF-BB mRNAs, overall reflecting reduced activation of remodeling in response to liver injury. The wound healing response was similar in S1P3-/- and WT mice. In vitro, S1P enhanced proliferation of cultured WT hMF, and PDGF-BB further enhanced the mitogenic effect of S1P. In keeping with these findings, PDGF-BB up-regulated S1P2 and SphK1 mRNAs, increased SphK activity, and S1P2 induced PDGF-BB mRNA. These effects were blunted in S1P2-/- cells, and S1P2-/- hMF exhibited reduced mitogenic and comitogenic responses to S1P. These results unravel a novel major role of S1P2 in the wound healing response to acute liver injury by a mechanism involving enhanced proliferation of hMF."

In mouse embryos deficient of Disabled-2 (Dab2), the primitive endoderm cells lose the ability to position on the surface, resulting in defective morphogenesis. Embryonic stem cells lacking Dab2 are also unable to position on the surface of cell aggregates and fail to form a primitive endoderm outer layer in the embryoid bodies. The cellular function of Dab2, a cargo-selective adaptor, in mediating endocytic trafficking of clathrin-coated vesicles is well established. We show here that Dab2 mediates directional trafficking and polarized distribution of cell surface proteins such as megalin and E-cadherin and propose that loss of polarity is the underlying mechanism for the loss of epithelial cell surface positioning in Dab2-deficient embryos and embryoid bodies.

Thus, the findings indicate that Dab2 is a surface positioning gene and suggest a novel mechanism of epithelial cell surface targeting. Epithelial cells are positioned on the outer surface of organs or the inner surface of glandular structures and are involved in diverse physiological functions. Simple epithelia consist of monolayered cells that form a sheet through cell-cell adherens junctions and attach to a basement membrane that lies underneath (1Birchmeier W. Birchmeier C. Epithelial Morphogenesis in Development and Disease. Hardwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1999Google Scholar). Epithelial cells are polarized with the apical surface exposed, or free from cell-cell contact and the basal side lying in contact with a basement membrane or stromal cells. The cell-free apical space and basal contact are unique hallmarks of an epithelium and are likely positioning cues for the surface localization of the epithelial cells (2Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 335-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar), although the molecular details and genes critical for epithelial cell surface positioning are yet uncertain and undefined. The concept that cues are required for epithelial surface positioning is also reinforced by observations of the disorganized growth of carcinomas. Carcinoma cells can be viewed as epithelial cells that have lost their ability to perceive surface positioning cues, and the neoplastic cells no longer obey the constraint imposed by tissue organization (3Clark Jr., W.H. Acta Oncol. 1995; 34: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The early embryos of vertebrates, especially mammalian species, have great plasticity, and significant cell dispersal, movement, and migration occur before their final positioning and acquisition of cell fates (4Wolpert L. Beddington R. Jessell T. Lawrence P. Meyweroitz E. Smith J. Principles of Development. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002Google Scholar). Shown in the classical cell sorting experiments by Townes and Holtfreter (5Townes P.L. Holtfreter J. J. Exp. Zool. 1955; 128: 53-120Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar), early embryonic amphibian cells of epidermis, endoderm, mesoderm, and neural plate, if dispersed, are able to segregate spontaneously upon aggregation, indicating cell positioning is an autonomous property. The primitive endoderm of mammalian early embryos is the first typical epithelial cell type derived that is capable of producing a basement membrane (6Adamson E.D. Ayers S.E. Cell. 1979; 16: 953-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Recent understanding is that the primitive endoderm cells arise from the differentiation of the pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass and migrate out to the surface to form the primitive endoderm layer (7Rossant J. Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 8Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y. Pawson T. Rossant J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The mechanism for how the primitive endoderm cells actually perceive this cell surface positioning cue is not yet understood. Disabled-1 is a gene recognized to have a role in “positioning” of brain cells in development (9Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A.

The other mammalian ortholog, Disabled-2 (Dab2), 3The abbreviations used are: Dab2, disabled-2; ES, embryonic stem; PAS, periodic acid-Schiff; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is highly expressed in many epithelial cell types but is lost in cancer cells (11Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Dab2 interacts with several components of the endocytic apparatus including the α-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein AP-2, clathrin, the cytoplasmic domain of lipoprotein receptor-related protein family members, and the endocytic motor protein myosin VI (12Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Dab2 functions as a cargo-selective endocytic adaptor linking clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles to the actin-based myosin VI, traveling unidirectionally along cellular microfilaments. Although the cellular function of the endocytic adaptor Dab2 has been well studied in vitro, no significant biological phenotypes related to its role in endocytosis were identified in cultured cells (12Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The important biological role of the dab2 gene was revealed by the early embryonic lethality of dab2(-/-) mouse embryos (15Morris S.M. Tallquist M.D. Rock C.O. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Yang D.H. Smith E.R. Roland I.H. Sheng Z. He J. Martin W.D. Hamilton T.C. Lambeth J.D. Xu X.X. Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). From the analysis of the dab2-deficient phenotypes in mice, embryoid bodies, and cultured cells, we realized Dab2 may be a critical determinant for the formation and maintenance of epithelial polarity, and the ability of epithelial cells to generate polarity may be the mechanism for their surface positioning. Dab2-deficient Mice—Two lines of dab2 knock-out mice were established previously (16Yang D.H. Smith E.R. Roland I.H. Sheng Z. He J. Martin W.D. Hamilton T.C. Lambeth J.D. Xu X.X. Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and the colonies were maintained in the C57BL6 background by inbreeding in the animal facility of Fox Chase Cancer Center. The two lines have given identical phenotypes and will not be distinguished here. Genotyping—At earlier stages (earlier than E6.5), dab2 genotyping was performed by examining the morphology and/or Dab2 immunostaining of the embryos. dab2(+/+) or (+/-) and (-/-) genotypes were distinguished by immunostaining of Dab2 in neighboring sections. Dab2-positive littermates in the same uterus were used as positive controls. For adult mice, DNA was extracted from tails to amplify simultaneously in PCR reactions both the wild-type (850 bp) and targeted (1100 bp) allele. The PCR reaction was set up by addition to the template DNA a common master mix of PCR reagents including three primers: a sense primer P1 (5′-CACATATGAGAGAGAACGGGC-3′) in the dab2 gene, an antisense primer for the wild-type dab2 gene P2 (3′-CGGGGCAGCCTGTTGGCCT-5′), and another antisense primer P3 (3′-CCGTGCATCTGCCAGTTTGAG-5′) specific for the recombinant mutant allele. Histology and Histochemistry—Uteri containing embryos at different developmental stages were collected, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded. Sections (5 μm) were cut and adhered to positively charged slides (Fisher). Standard H&E staining was applied. Immunohistochemistry using a primary antibody to Dab2 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) diluted 1:400 was performed as described previously (16Yang D.H. Smith E.R. Roland I.H. Sheng Z. He J. Martin W.D. Hamilton T.C. Lambeth J.D. Xu X.X. Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). For GATA4 staining, the sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by steaming for 20 min in citrate buffer (10 mm). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GATA4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used at 1:800 dilution. For periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, slides were first subjected to deparaffinization and hydration, submerged in PAS solution (Sigma) for 20 min and then counterstained with hematoxylin. For lectin histochemistry, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin from Sigma was used to stain primitive endoderm cells. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Generally, cells were cultured on glass coverslips or in slide chambers and analyzed using CCD or laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Antibodies, both mouse monoclonals and rabbit polyclonals, for Dab2, megalin laminin (Sigma), and rat E-cadherin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used. For immunofluorescence microscopy, anti-megalin and Dab2 antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The cellular localization of the antigens was revealed by fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at 1:200 dilution. The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Texas Red and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Rabbit anti-megalin antibodies were used with mouse anti-Dab2 anti-bodies for double labeling. Nuclei were marked by DAPI staining. A Nikon Eclipse E 800 epifluorescence microscope with 60× oil immersion objective linked to a Roper Quantix CCD (charged-coupled device) camera was used to examine the slides. siRNA Down-regulation of Dab2 in Cell Culture—We have established a siRNA approach to down-regulate Dab2 expression in both human and mouse cells using a sequence of 21-bp oligonucleotides 367 bp downstream from the ATG site (Dab2siRNA367) (see below) that effectively down-regulates the Dab2 protein level when transfected into cells. A Dab2-siRNA expression vector (GeneSuppressor, Imgenex) was constructed based on this sequence. The transcript is under the control of the U6 promoter, and the vector contains a neomycin resistance gene as a selectable marker. Dab2 Is Required for Endoderm Organization in Early Mouse Embryos—The early embryonic lethality of dab2(-/-) mouse embryos (15Morris S.M. Tallquist M.D. Rock C.O. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1555-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 16Yang D.H. Smith E.R. Roland I.H. Sheng Z. He J. Martin W.D. Hamilton T.C. Lambeth J.D. Xu X.X. Dev. Biol. 2002; 251: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) is not well explained by the lack of a prominent cellular phenotype related to its role in endocytosis, which is revealed by studies in cultured cells (12Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Morris S.M. Arden S.D. Roberts R.C. Kendrick-Jones J. Cooper J.A. Luzio J.P. Buss F. Traffic. 2002; 3: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We therefore further characterized the dab2(-/-) embryos to determine the link between the known cellular function of Dab2 and the mechanism leading to the phenotype presented in knock-out mice. Dab2 is expressed in the peripheral endoderm layer of E4.5-5.5 embryos. In all E4.0-4.5 embryos from the crossing of dab2(+/-) parents, primitive endoderm cells indicated by positive D. biflorus agglutinin staining were located throughout the inner cell mass, which is relatively small at this stage (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the reported “salt and pepper” pattern of GATA6 staining of the embryos at this stage (8Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y. Pawson T. Rossant J. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Thus, the phenotype of Dab2 loss is not apparent at E4.0-4.5 since Dab2-positive and -negative embryos are indistinguishable by primitive endoderm markers. By E5.5, the effect of Dab2 loss is clear: the dab2(-/-) embryos, identified by the absence of Dab2 staining, appear disorganized and lack a recognizable endoderm layer (Fig. 1B). In wild-type embryos, the Dab2-expressing primitive endoderm cells form a polarized epithelium and further differentiate into visceral (Fig. 1B, arrow) and parietal (Fig. 1B, double arrows) endoderm cells at this stage. The visceral endoderm cells are organized into an epithelium at the periphery of the egg cylinder (Fig. 1B, arrow). These cells are polarized with a microvillous apical surface facing the yolk sac cavity (17Bielinska M. Narita N. Wilson D.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 183-205PubMed Google Scholar, 18Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 195-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The parietal endoderm cells migrate to cover the inner surface of the trophoblast layer and are responsible for producing the thick, multilayered basement membrane (Reichert's membrane) found between parietal endoderm and trophectoderm cells (17Bielinska M. Narita N. Wilson D.B. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 183-205PubMed Google Scholar, 18Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 195-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). GATA4 is a specific endoderm marker in early embryos (19Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its expression is restricted to the visceral endoderm cells forming an epithelial layer covering the surface of the primitive egg cylinder (Fig. 1C, arrow) and the parietal endoderm cells outlining the embryo (Fig. 1C, double arrows), as shown in an example of an E5.5 embryo. In the dab2(-/-) embryos, however, GATA4-positive cells (nuclei stained dark brown, arrowhead) are present but are disorganized and distributed throughout the mass of the embryonic cells (Fig. 1C, arrowhead). One property of parietal endoderm cells is the ability to actively express and produce laminin and collagen IV for the construction of Reichert's membrane (20Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 21Fowler K.J. Mitrangas K. Dziadek M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 194-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Parietal cells can be distinguished by their strong laminin staining (Fig. 1D, arrow), whereas the visceral endoderm cells are negative or very weak for laminin staining (Fig. 1D, double arrows). In the dab2(-/-) E5.5 embryos, no laminin-positive parietal endoderm layer can be detected (Fig. 1D). Instead, laminin-positive, presumably parietal endoderm cells remain in the interior of the embryonic cells of an E5.5 dab2(-/-) embryo (Fig. 1D, arrowhead), and dab2(-/-) parietal endoderm cells fail to position on the surface and migrate to cover the blasto-coel surface. This result suggests that Dab2 deficiency does not block primitive endoderm differentiation and subsequent derivation of visceral and parietal endoderm cells but rather leads to the loss of surface positioning and epithelial organization of the differentiated parietal and visceral endoderm cells. Loss of Apical Localization of Glycoproteins in Visceral Endoderm Cells of Dab2-deficient Embryos—The glycoprotein/transmembrane receptor megalin, which binds Dab2 (22Oleinikov A.V. Zhao J. Makker S.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is located on the apical surface of epithelial cells and is a marker for apical-basal polarity (23Gueth-Hallonet C. Santa-Maria A. Verroust P. Maro B. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 3289-3299PubMed Google Scholar). In an immunostaining of an E5.5 embryo, megalin is detected only at the apical edge of visceral endoderm cells (Fig. 2A and B, arrow). In a representative dab2(-/-) E5.5 embryo, megalin-positive, presumptive visceral endoderm cells are found in the interior of the embryonic cell mass. Close inspection indicates that megalin is no longer restricted to one side of the cell surface but is distributed diffusely along the entire cell surface as well as in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A, arrowhead). The distribution of megalin and Dab2 in E5.5 embryos was further characterized by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B). In the Dab2-positive E5.5 embryo, megalin (green) is restricted to the apical membrane of the surface endoderm epithelial cells, and Dab2 (red) is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the visceral endoderm cells (Fig. 2B). The polarized distribution of megalin is lost in Dab2 knock-out embryos (Fig. 2B). Thus, the Dab2 protein is required to establish the polarity of megalin distribution in the visceral endoderm cells. The PAS reaction stains carbohydrates and carbohydrate-rich macromolecules, including megalin, and stains the apical surface of the visceral endodermal cells (Fig. 2C, arrowhead). As shown in a higher magnification of the indicated areas (Fig. 2D), the PAS staining of the visceral endoderm cells in the normal embryos is restricted to the glycoproteins of the brush border, the outermost layer of the cells on the apical side of the membranes that enclose the vacuoles. In contrast, although PAS-stained cells are present in E5.5 embryos identified as dab2(-/-) by the absence of Dab2 staining (Fig. 2, C and D), no endoderm layer with a distinct brush border can be observed. The PAS staining is more diffuse or cytoplasmic (Fig. 2C, arrow, also shown in a higher magnification in Fig. 2D), and the staining in some cells (arrow) appears to be in cellular structures located more interior than the vacuoles of the cells. Thus, the loss of Dab2 influences apical localization not only of megalin but also of the majority of the apical glycoproteins. Dab2 Is Required for the Surface Positioning of Endoderm Epithelial Cells in Embryoid Bodies—We used embryoid bodies from the aggregation of embryonic stem (ES) cells as models (24Coucouvanis E.

Dev. Biol. 2005; 286: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to investigate the role of Dab2 in the formation of the endoderm structure. The siRNA approach was used to down-regulate Dab2 expression in cells in cultures. A siRNA targeting sequence for strong Dab2 suppression was found following testing of three mouse dab2 cDNA sequences in transient transfection experiments, and this optimal sequence (Dab2siRNA367) was inserted into a neo-selectable siRNA expression vector. Dab2 expression in pooled G418-selected clones was greatly suppressed compared with vector-transfected controls (Fig. 3A). The Dab2-suppressed ES cells were no longer capable of forming embryoid bodies with a primitive endoderm outer layer as seen in wildtype ES cells following aggregation (Fig. 3B, arrow). GATA4 and Dab2 staining indicates the lining of primitive endoderm cells on the surface of embryoid bodies derived from wildtype ES cells (Fig. 3C, arrow). However, the GATA4-positive presumptive primitive endoderm cells are not localized on the surface but are distributed throughout the interior of the spheroids derived from Dab2-suppressed ES cells (Fig. 3C, arrowhead). In two independent experiments, of over 50 embryoid bodies derived from Dab2-suppressed ES cells examined, all lack an endoderm structure on the surface. Among these, two embryoid bodies were observed to contain a few Dab2-positive cells (presumably those lost siRNA suppression). Another two examples of the random distribution of GATA4-positive cells in spheroids formed from Dab2-suppressed ES cells are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Thus, Dab2 is required for the surface positioning of endoderm epithelial cells in embryoid bodies. Dab2 Is Required for Apical Localization of Megalin in Cultured Cells—An obvious question is whether the observed loss of endoderm cell polarity in dab2 knock-out embryos is the cause or the consequence of the disorganization of the embryos and embryoid bodies. Thus, we examined the phenotype of Dab2 loss in cultured cells. When treated with retinoic acid for 4 days in monolayer culture, the majority of mouse ES cells differentiated into primitive endoderm-like cells (19Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Capo-Chichi C.D. Rula M.E. Smedberg J.L. Vanderveer L. Parmacek M.S. Morrisey E.E. Godwin A.K. Xu X.X. Dev. Biol. 2005; 286: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These cells are an epithelial type and express collagen IV, laminin, megalin, and Dab2. In the endoderm-like cells derived from wild-type ES cells, megalin is largely confined to the outer ring of multiple cell aggregates, defining a compartment in these cultured cells corresponding to the apical surface of an epithelium (Fig. 4A, arrow), and megalin is absent in the cell-cell contact surface (arrowhead). In Dab2 downregulated cells, the megalin-stained outer rim disappears and the megalin staining displays a punctate cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 4B). Generally in the wild-type cells, the cytoplasmic Dab2 and the apical membrane megalin have minimal colocalization. Likely the megalin-containing endocytic cargos recycle back to the apical membrane rapidly and linger in the cytoplasm only in the absence of Dab2. It has been reported, however, that Dab2 is required for internalization of megalin (26Maurer M.E. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5345-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Such a discrepancy may due to different systems and remains to be resolved. Dab2 Is Required for Apical Exclusion of E-cadherin in Cultured Cells—In the Dab2-down-regulated cells, we observed a dramatic loss of polarized distribution of surface E-cadherin. The cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin is a principal component of the epithelial adherens junction, and its function is critical for cell organization and the development of blastocysts (27Riethmacher D. Brinkmann V. Birchmeier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Targeting and restricting E-cadherin molecules to the bilateral domain where adherens junctions are organized is an early and necessary step in establishing epithelial polarity (28Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 29Wodarz A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E39-E44Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In undifferentiated ES cells, E-cadherin, though present in the junction surfaces between cells that make contact, distributed in the cytoplasm in a speckled pattern (Fig. 5A). In retinoic acid-treated/differentiated cells, E-cadherin was restricted to the cell-cell junctions with little cytoplasmic staining. Presumably this E-cadherin staining pattern reflects the apical-basal polarity of an epithelium, with E-cadherin expression restricted to bilateral domains (Fig. 5A, arrowhead) and absent from the apical surface (Fig. 5A, arrow). When Dab2 was down-regulated in the cells, however, the polarized cellular distribution of E-cadherin was abolished: although most of the protein was still membranous, E-cadherin aligned along the entire cellular membrane including the apical surface (Fig. 5A, arrowhead). This apical localization of E-cadherin depends on cell-cell contacts. In Dab2-suppressed cells that were isolated and lacked contact with neighboring cells (Fig. 5B), E-cadherin had a spotted distribution in the cytoplasm (arrowhead). No surface E-cadherin staining was ever observed in single cells, and apical E-cadherin staining (arrow) was only observed in a group of two or more Dab2-down-regulated cells (Fig. 5B). The dotted E-cadherin cellular staining pattern likely represents E-cadherin localized in endocytic vesicles. In Dab2-positive cells, such E-cadherin-containing endocytic vesicles often could be observed in single/isolated cells or in a group of two contacting cells, as shown in an example in Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. 2. Most of the E-cadherin-containing vesicles are also Dab2-positive (Fig. 5C, arrow), indicating the localization to the same population of endocytic cargos. The loss of E-cadherin polarized surface distribution in Dab2-suppressed cells suggests that Dab2 is involved either in the bilateral targeting or more likely in the apical removal of E-cadherin. In mouse embryos, E-cadherin is also present in dab2(-/-) cells, although presumably the distribution is not polarized (supplemental Fig. 3). Thus, Dab2 has a crucial role in regulating the cellular trafficking and polarized distribution of E-cadherin. Although E-cadherin is known to traffic in clathrin-coated cargos (30Bryant D.M. Stow J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), with which Dab2 also associates (12Morris S.M. Cooper J.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 14Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C. Traub L.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), it is not known if additional direct or indirect interactions exist between E-cadherin and Dab2 for the recruitment of E-cadherin into Dab2-positive cargos. The finding from the Dab2-suppressed ES cells is that removal of E-cadherin from the apical domain, in addition to bilateral targeting, is also important in the polarized distribution of E-cadherin. These cell culture experiments indicate that loss of Dab2 influences targeting cell surface proteins such as megalin and E-cadherin to the apical cell surface. This study leads to the identification of dab2 as a gene required for positioning of epithelial cells on surface. We propose that the activity of Dab2 in the coupling of selective cargos to unidirectional cellular trafficking results in the genesis and maintenance of epithelial polarity. Subsequently, we suggest that a consequence of epithelial apical-basal polarity may be the surface positioning and monolayered structure of epithelium. The finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the early embryonic phenotype of Dab2 knock-out embryos. Thus, the study reveals a novel mechanism for the positioning of cells on the surface, as demonstrated for the development of the first embryonic epithelium, the primitive endoderm, in mammals. Role of Dab2 in Generation and Maintenance of Epithelial Polarity—The generation and maintenance of epithelial polarity is a fascinating question in cell biology (2Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J.

Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, trHbs can be further divided into three subgroups as follows: trHbI, trHbII, and trHbIII (32Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). trHbI and trHbII have been studied extensively (see Refs. 1Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 72-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 33Milani M. Pesce A. Nardini M. Ouellet H. Ouellet Y. Dewilde S. Bocedi A. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Moens L. Friedman J.M. Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and references therein). In contrast, little is known about trHbIII. Campylobacter jejuni is a microaerophilic bacterium present in the gut of many food-supply animals and birds. It is one of the most important causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Like several other pathogenic bacteria, C. jejuni contains more than one Hb, Cgb and Ctb, which belong to the group two and trHbIII class of Hbs, respectively. Neither of them is essential for growth under laboratory conditions, but both are up-regulated as components of a regulon responsive to NO and other nitrosative stresses (34Elvers K.T. Turner S.M. Wainwright L.M. Marsden G. Hinds J. Cole J.A. Poole R.K. Penn C.W. Park S.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 735-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When cgb is knocked out in C. jejuni, the bacterium becomes hypersensitive to reactive nitrogen species. As such, Cgb has been proposed to protect the bacterium against NO attack (35Elvers K.T. Wu G. Gilberthorpe N.J. Poole R.K. Park S.F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5332-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), perhaps via an NO dioxygenase reaction. On the other hand, when ctb is knocked out in C. jejuni, the bacterium does not show extra sensitivity to nitrosative stress, but it is disadvantaged and has lowered respiration rates when grown under conditions of high aeration, suggesting a role of Ctb in moderating intracellular O2 flux (35Elvers K.T. Wu G. Gilberthorpe N.J. Poole R.K. Park S.F. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5332-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The proximal heme ligand of Ctb is a His at the F8 position (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 81Nardini M. Pesce A. Labarre M. Richard C. Bolli A. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 281: 37803-37812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which is perfectly conserved in the Hb superfamily. The amino acid residues at the B10, E7, E11, and G8 positions, which have been recognized as critical residues in stabilizing heme ligands in other Hbs, are occupied by Tyr, His, Ile, and Trp, respectively. In previous resonance Raman studies (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the proximal iron-histidine stretching mode (νFe-His) of Ctb was identified at 226 cm-1, indicating a structurally nonconstrained proximal His ligand that was confirmed by the crystal structure (81Nardini M. Pesce A. Labarre M. Richard C. Bolli A. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 281: 37803-37812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the CO derivative, the νFe-CO was found at 514 cm-1, 7 cm-1 higher than that of the sperm whale myoglobin (swMb), suggesting the presence of H-bonding interactions between the CO and the distal polar residue(s), Tyr(B10), His(E7), and/or Trp(G8) (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Trp(G8) is highly conserved in the trHbII and trHbIII classes of proteins. In the crystal structure of the trHbII from either Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB code 1NGK) or Bacillus subtilis (PDB code 1UX8), the Trp(G8) side chain lies parallel and in contact with the heme plane; in addition, it forms an H-bond with the heme-bound ligand (31Milani M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5766-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Giangiacomo L. Ilari A. Boffi A. Morea V. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9192-9202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the His(E7)-Tyr(B10) pair is rarely observed in Hbs, because of possible steric interference of the two bulky side chains in the typically crowded distal heme pocket, as suggested by the studies of the B10LY mutant of swMb (38Draghi F. Miele A.E. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vallone B. Brunori M. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7509-7519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Noticeably, in addition to the Tyr(B10)-His(E7) pair and Trp(G8), the E4, B9, and CD1 positions in Ctb are also occupied by bulky aromatic residues (Trp, Phe, and Phe, respectively), which are all highly conserved in trHbIII. As a first step to investigate this peculiar distal heme environment of Ctb and how it may impact its function, we have systematically studied the structural properties of the CO and O2 derivatives of Ctb as a function of distal mutations, including B10YF,E7HL, and B10YF/E7HL, with resonance Raman spectroscopy. The functional implications were further evaluated by examining the oxygen dissociation and association kinetics of the mutants with respect to the wild type protein. Ctb was expressed and purified as described previously (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The E7HL and B10YF single mutants and B10YF/E7HL double mutant were prepared by using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. Primers were designed with the codon for the mutated amino acid in the center. They were as follows: B10YF, forward primer (5′-GCATAGCAAAACTCATGGAAATATTTTTTGAAAAAGTTAGAAAAGATAAGGATTTAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CTAAATCCTTATCTTTTCTAACTTTTTCAAAAAATATTTCCAATGAGTTTTGCTATGC-3′); E7HA, forward primer (5′-CAAGCGATGAAGAATGGAAAGAAGCTAAAGCAAAAATAGGAAATTTTTGGG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CCCAAAAATTTCCTATTTTTGCTTTAGCTTCTTTCCATTCTTCATCGCTTG-3′). A PCR was carried out on pBAD/His (Invitrogen) carrying the ctb gene using primers appropriate for the desired mutation. The PCR was then incubated with DpnI, an endonuclease specific for methylated DNA. The remaining nonparental mutated DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli XL1-Blue super-competent cells. The constructs were checked by sequencing. The mutants were purified in the same way as for wild type Ctb (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To prepare pure ferric derivatives, the protein samples were first treated with 3-5 eq of potassium ferricyanide (Aldrich) and then purified by G-25 column chromatography. To form the CO-bound ferrous complexes, 12C16O (Tech Air, NY) or 13C18O (Icon Isotopes, Summit, NJ) was injected into sodium dithionite-reduced Ctb under anaerobic conditions. The 16O2-bound derivative was prepared by passing the CO-bound protein through a G-25 column to allow the exchange of CO with atmospheric 16O2 and to remove the excess of dithionite. The 18O2-bound sample, on the other hand, was prepared by injecting 18O2 into an 16O2-bound protein solution, which was freshly purged with argon, followed by spontaneous exchange of heme-bound 16O2 with 18O2. The concentration of the protein samples used for the Raman measurements was ∼30 μm in pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer (100 mm). Optical absorption spectra were taken on a spectrophotometer (UV2100U from Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Columbia, MD) with a spectral slit width of 1 nm. The resonance Raman spectra were taken on instruments described elsewhere (1Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 72-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, 413.1 nm excitation from a Kr ion laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) was focused to an ∼30 μm spot on the spinning sample cell. The scattered light was collected by a camera lens, dispersed through a polychromator (Spex, Metuchen, NJ), which is equipped with a 1200 grooves/mm grating, and detected by a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Princeton, NJ). A holographic notch filter (Kaiser, Ann Arbor, MI) was used to remove the laser scattering. Typically the laser power was kept at ∼1 milliwatt, and the spectral acquisition time was 60 min. The cosmic ray spikes were removed by a standard software routine (CCD spectrometric multichannel analysis, Princeton Instruments, NJ). The Raman shift was calibrated by using indene (Sigma) and an acetone/ferrocyanide (Sigma) mixture as the references for the 200-1700 and 1600-2200 cm-1 spectral window, respectively. For the O2 dissociation kinetic measurements, the reaction was initiated by injecting a small volume (∼50-60 μl) of concentrated O2-bound protein into a sealed quartz cuvette containing ∼850-900 μl of pH 7.4 buffer (50 mm Tris and 50 μm EDTA) with 500 or 1000 μm CO. The final concentrations of O2-bound protein and free oxygen were ∼4-10 and 60 μm, respectively. The spontaneous replacement of the heme-bound O2 with CO, which was rate-limited by the dissociation of the O2, was monitored as a function of time at 422 and 405 nm. The reaction rates thus obtained were independent of CO concentration applied or wavelength monitored. The O2 association kinetics were measured with a nanosecond laser flash photolysis system (LKS.60 from Applied Photo-physics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK). In this system, the 532 nm output (∼5 ns, 110 mJ) from a Nd:YAG laser (Brilliant B from Big Sky Laser Technologies, Inc) was employed as the photolysis beam. The output from a 150-watt xenon arc lamp, at right angles to the photolysis beam, was used as the probe beam. The probe beam passed through a monochromator prior to reaching the quartz cuvette (4 × 10 mm with a 10-mm optical path) containing the sample. The light transmitted through the sample entered a second monochromator, which was synchronized with the first monochromator and was detected by a photomultiplier tube (1P28 from Hamamatsu Corp.). The signal from the photomultiplier tube was transferred to a digital oscilloscope (Infinium from Agilent Technologies) and then to a personal computer for subsequent analysis. Typically, five or six kinetic traces were averaged to obtain a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. The O2 association reactions were initiated by flashing off CO with the photolysis beam in a freshly prepared mixture of a dithionite-free CO-bound complex (with ∼0.2 mm CO) in the presence of various concentration of O2. The dithionite-free CO-bound complex was prepared by spontaneous replacement of the O2 in the oxy derivatives with CO by extensive purging with CO gas. Under the conditions applied, the rebinding of the CO to the heme iron was much slower than the O2 association reactions, which was monitored at 440 nm following the photolysis. Fig. 1 shows the optical absorption spectra of the exogenous ligand-free ferric as well as the CO- and O2-bound ferrous derivatives of the wild type Ctb. These spectra, which are typical for the Hb family of proteins, are not significantly affected by the mutations in the B10 and/or E7 residues (data not shown). In contrast, resonance Raman spectroscopy, which has been demonstrated to be much more sensitive to small structural perturbations in heme proteins (39Yeh S.R. Couture M. Ouellet Y. Guertin M.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12638-12646Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar), reveals several unique structural features of Ctb that are sensitive to the distal mutations and are distinct from other Hbs. CO Derivatives—The top trace in Fig. 2 shows the resonance Raman spectrum of the CO derivative of the wild type Ctb. The 515 cm-1 band shifted to lower frequency when 12C16O was substituted by 13C18O, as manifested by the isotope difference spectrum shown in the insert. This band was assigned to the Fe-CO stretching mode (νFe-CO) as reported previously (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Likewise, an isotope-sensitive band at 1936 cm-1 was assigned to the C-O stretching mode (νC-O) (36Wainwright L.M. Wang Y. Park S.F. Yeh S.R. Poole R.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6003-6011Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is well accepted that when CO is coordinated to the ferrous heme iron, the Fe-CO moiety exists in the following two resonance forms because of the π-back bonding from the iron to the CO, which donates electron density from the dπ orbital of the iron back to the π* orbital of the CO as shown in Reaction 1. Fe5--C≡Oδ+(I)↔Fe=C=O(II)REACTION1 In general, a positive polar environment destabilizes form (I) and facilitates the π back-bonding interaction, leading to a stronger Fe-CO bond and a weaker C-O bond (see Ref. 42Yu N.-T. Kerr E.A. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy: Resonance Raman Spectra of Hemes and Metalloproteins. Vol. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 39-95Google Scholar and references therein). On this basis, the νFe-CO and νC-O typically follow a well known inverse correlation as illustrated in Fig. 3A (43Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 44Vogel K.M. Kozlowski P.M. Zgierski M.Z. Spiro T.G. Inorg. Chim.

Along these lines, it has been shown that the electrostatic field in the distal pocket of Mb quantitatively correlates with νFe-CO and inversely with νC-O (46Phillips Jr., G.N. Teodoro M.L. Li T. Smith B. Olson J.S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8817-8829Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In swMb, the heme-bound CO is stabilized by an H-bond donated from the His(E7), which leads to a νFe-CO at 507 cm-1. On the other hand, the Hbs from microorganisms studied to date can be divided into two groups based on the electrostatic environment of the CO as follows:1) those adopting two conformations with νFe-CO at ∼490 and ∼535 cm-1, and 2) those displaying a single fixed conformation with νFe-CO varying from ∼490 to 525 cm-1 (see Ref. 1Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 72-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and references therein). Remarkably, all the Hbs belonging to the first group, including Hmp from E. coli, Vgb from Vitreoscilla, and trHbN from M. tuberculosis, have been suggested to perform NO dioxygenase reactions physiologically to protect the corresponding organisms from nitrosative stress (2Wu G. Wainwright L.M. Poole R.K. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2003; 47: 255-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 27Couture M. Yeh S.R. Wittenberg B.A. Wittenberg J.B. Ouellet Y. Rousseau D.L. Guertin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11223-11228Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 47Kaur R. Pathania R. Sharma V. Mande S.C. Dikshit K.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The two νFe-CO modes in this group of Hbs are attributed to an open and a closed conformation, respectively (1Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 72-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the closed conformation, the heme-bound CO is stabilized by H-bonding interactions with a Tyr residue at the B10 position and a Gln residue at the E7 (e.g. Hmp) or E11 position (e.g. trHbN), whereas in the open conformation these H-bonding interactions are absent. We have postulated that the conformational flexibility of these microbial Hbs, as reflected by their ability to adopt the two conformations, is a structural feature that is important for the catalysis of the isomerization of the peroxynitrite intermediate to nitrate and/or the facilitation of the release of the nitrate product during the turnover of the NO dioxygenase reaction (1Egawa T. Yeh S.R. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 72-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Mukai M. Savard P.Y. Ouellet H. Guertin M. Yeh S.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3897-3905Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 78Mukai M. Mills C.E. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Evidently, Ctb belongs to the second group of Hbs with a fixed single conformation. The location of the data point in the inverse correlation line (Fig. 3A) suggests a distal environment with a medium positive electrostatic potential. Intriguingly, the mutation of the His(E7) to Leu causes the protein to convert to a structure with two conformations as follows: a wild type-like conformation with the νFe-CO/νC-O at 517/1938 cm-1 and a new conformation with a distal pocket exhibiting extremely high positive electrostatic potential as indicated by the νFe-CO/νC-O at 557/1893 cm-1 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the B10YF single mutant and the B10YF/E7HL double mutant display a single conformation with νFe-CO/νC-O at 524/1914 and 521/1926 cm-1, respectively. The fact that these data points stay on the same inverse correlation line (Fig. 3A) indicates that the structural changes in the distal pocket do not affect the electronic properties of the proximal His. The νFe-CO of the B10YF/E7HL double mutant at 521 cm-1 is significantly higher than that of the wild type protein (515 cm-1), indicating that the heme-bound CO in the mutant is stabilized by an H-bonding interaction with the Trp(G8), the only polar residue remaining in the vicinity of the ligand as suggested by the recently published crystal structure of the cyano-met derivative of Ctb (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the presence of a wild type-like conformation in the E7HL mutant indicates that the His(E7) in the wild type protein does not directly interact with the heme-bound CO. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that in the wild type protein the His(E7) forms an H-bond with the Tyr(B10) that limits the conformational freedom of the phenolic side chain of the Tyr(B10) and inhibits its direct interaction with the heme ligand as illustrated in Fig. 3C. The mutation of the His(E7) to Leu disrupts this H-bonding interaction and frees up the Tyr(B10) side chain, which can either stay in the native location (E7I) or move to a new position (E7II) to form a new H-bond with the heme-bound CO, along with the Trp(G8). The new H-bonding network in E7II leads to the astonishingly high electrostatic potential surrounding the CO, as indicated by the extremely high νFe-CO at 557 cm-1. To our knowledge, this frequency represents the highest νFe-CO ever reported for heme proteins with His as the proximal heme ligand! Similarly, in the B10YF mutant the disruption of the H-bond between the Tyr(B10) and His(E7) frees up the His to form a new H-bond with the heme-bound CO (Fig. 3C), thereby accounting for the 9-cm-1 up-shift in the νFe-CO with respect to the wild type protein. Likewise, the 6-cm-1 up-shift in the νFe-CO of the B10YF/E7HL double mutant is attributed to the rearrangement of the Trp(G8) side chain to a new stereo orientation that favors the formation of a more stable H-bond with the heme-bound CO (Fig. 3C). In the B10LY mutant of swMb, the simultaneous presence of the Tyr(B10) and His(E7) has been shown to introduce conformational heterogeneity to the protein because of steric interference between the side chains in the crowded distal pocket (38Draghi F.

In contrast, the naturally occurring Tyr(B10)-His(E7) pair in the leghemoglobin (LegHb) from the roots of leguminous plants avoids the steric problem by forming H-bonds with each other (49Hargrove M.S. Barry J.K. Brucker E.A. Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Arredondo-Peter R. Dean J.M. Klucas R.V. Sarath G. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, the data reported here indicate that the H-bond between the His(E7) and the Tyr(B10) in Ctb (Fig. 3C) reduces the unfavorable steric interactions between the two residues and positions the Tyr(B10) in a proper stereo orientation for O2 stabilization as will be discussed in more detail below. It is important to note that although the H-bonds between the heme-bound CO an"

Exactly how pVHL functions as a tumor suppressor remains unclear but, in part, involves its action in an E3 ligase complex that targets prolyl-hydroxylated α-subunits of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for degradation (2Maxwell P.H.

Although the precise mode of tumor promotion is unclear, HIF target gene products play a central role in a wide range of functions in tumor biology (5Semenza G.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (5248) Google Scholar), and genetic studies have demonstrated a clear positive role for the HIF-2α isoform at least in the later stages of tumor development (6Kondo K.

Nevertheless, the mutational spectrum associated with VHL disease exhibits genotype/phenotype correlations that suggest more than one tumor suppressor action (1Kaelin W.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Specific patterns of mutations are associated with type 1 disease (hemangioblastoma, CCRC), type 2A (hemangioblastoma, phaeochromocytoma), type 2B (hemangioblastoma, phaeochromocytoma, CCRC), and type 2C (phaeochromocytoma only). Mutational dysregulation of HIF does not concord precisely with tumor predisposition (9Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Maher E.R. Hum.

Importantly a number of these are disrupted by tumor-associated mutations, suggesting a causal role in tumor suppressor function. One well studied but as yet poorly understood effect is the defective assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM) that is displayed by VHL-deficient CCRC cells (10Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several lines of investigation have suggested that this defect reflects a distinct HIF-independent function, and a link to the interaction of pVHL with an intracellular fraction of the ECM protein fibronectin has been proposed (12Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol.

First, mutations associated with type 2C VHL disease are competent for HIF regulation, but not ECM assembly (9Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H.

Second, comparative gene expression studies in Caenorhabditis elegans mutants that are defective for the single HIF-α homologue hif-1, or doubly defective for hif-1 and the VHL homologue vhl-1, have provided genetic evidence for a HIF-1-independent VHL-1 pathway that also appears connected with an ECM function (15Bishop T. Lau K.W. Epstein A.C. Kim S.K. Jiang M. O'Rourke D. Pugh C.W. Gleadle J.M. Taylor M.S. Hodgkin J. Ratcliffe P.J. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 1549-1560Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Third, studies of human CCRC cells expressing a non-degradable form of HIF-2α support the HIF independence of the VHL-associated ECM defect, also linking this pathway (as opposed to HIF activation) to enhanced angiogenesis (14Kurban G. Hudon V. Duplan E. Ohh M. Pause A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To better understand this HIF-independent function, we have continued to screen for pVHL-associated proteins using co-immunoprecipitation and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The structure of pVHL bound to hydroxylated HIF-α peptides reveals a discrete hydroxyproline binding pocket in the β-domain of pVHL that forms specific hydrogen bonds with hydroxylated, but not nonhydroxylated, HIF-α (16Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 17Min J.-H.

These studies predict that other proteins directly binding pVHL might contain sites of prolyl hydroxylation. Interestingly, the transcriptionally active hyperphosphorylated large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rbp1) has been identified as a second hydroxylation-dependent binding partner of pVHL (18Kuznetsova A.V. Meller J. Schnell P.O. Nash J.A. Ignacak M.L. Sanchez Y. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2706-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that this interaction is responsible for the observed effects on matrix assembly, suggesting that there might be other hydroxylated species that account for this function. Here we report the identification of collagen IV chains as pVHL-binding proteins and the characterization of a specific, direct, hydroxylation-dependent interaction between pVHL and unfolded collagen chains that is suppressed by tumor-associated mutations in a manner that is concordant with effects on ECM assembly.

Purified collagens were from Abcam and purified fibronectin from Chemicon. HA peptide was from Roche Applied Science, and biotinylated HIF-1α peptides (residues 556–574) were a gift from K. S. Hewitson. Extract Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cell extracts were prepared in Igepal lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.5% v/v Igepal CA630 with “Complete” Protease inhibitor (Roche) and 25 μm MG132). For immunoblotting of “Input” 8 μg of cell extract was used, representing 5 or 10% (as indicated) of the total protein used for immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation cell extract was precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with Protein A-agarose beads (Upstate) followed by 16 h of incubation (preparative scale) or 2 h (standard) with the appropriate antibody and affinity resin. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with Igepal buffer and either analyzed directly or subjected to glycine elution and trichloroacetic acid precipitation (for anti-pVHL and preparative scale anti-HA immunoprecipitates) prior to addition of Laemmli sample buffer, heat denaturation (5 min at 95 °C), and SDS-PAGE. For HIF-1α, V5 (PK tag), collagen I, and collagen IV immunoblotting, samples were first resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. For VHL, HA, FLAG, and β tubulin immunoblotting 15% SDS-PAGE was used. Immunoblotting signals were visualized with Lumigen™ PS-3 detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For denatured, non-reduced conditions, samples were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer without dithiothreitol and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Far Western Analysis—Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane, blocked using 4% (w/v) dried skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 (PBS/T) for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h with recombinant pVHL-elongin C-elongin B complex (VCB) (16Hon W.C.

VCB was omitted in mock far Western. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and excised gel fragments were digested with trypsin. Peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (20Batycka M. Inglis N.F. Cook K. Adam A. Fraser-Pitt D. Smith D.G. Main L. Lubben A. Kessler B.M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2006; 20: 2074-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MS/MS spectra were matched to the SwissProt data base using the Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science). Collagen IV Binds pVHL—Following large-scale anti-HA immunoprecipitation of extract from a stably transfected CCRC cell line expressing VHLHA (RCC4-VHLHA), several co-immunoprecipitating species were identified by MS/MS. Most corresponded to known pVHL-binding proteins (Elongin B, Cullin 2, TRiC chaperonin components (TCP-1α, ɛ, η), HIF-1α, HIF-2α), verifying the fidelity of the analysis. An additional species migrating with an apparent molecular mass of ∼220 kDa was newly assigned as containing the α1- and α2-chains of collagen IV (Fig. 1, A and B). A similar pVHL binding species has previously been visualized by 35S labeling in RCC4 and 786-O cells (9Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J.

To clarify the relationship between this species and the newly defined pVHL-collagen IV interaction, we performed further HA immunoprecipitations from 35S-labeled RCC4-VHLHA cells 3N. Masson, unpublished data. and similar transfectants expressing an HA-tagged internally initiated pVHL (RCC4-p19VHLHA) (Fig. 1C). Comparison of anti-HA, anti-collagen IV, and anti-fibronectin immunoprecipitates demonstrated exact co-migration of the major high molecular mass p19VHLHA-co-immunoprecipitating species with collagen IV, but not with fibronectin (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 markedly increased capture of HIF-1α but had no effect on this species. To confirm the identity of the ∼220-kDa species we eluted the anti-HA immunoprecipitates using HA peptide and re-immunoprecipitated the eluates with anti-collagen IV, anti-fibronectin, or anti-HIF-1α antibodies (Fig. 1C). Collagen IV was detected in the eluates in all conditions, whereas HIF-1α was only detected after MG132 treatment. These results confirm a specific association between collagen IV and pVHL that is independent of HIF. Collagen IV Binding Correlates with pVHL Tumor Suppressor Function—Previous studies of pVHL tumor suppressor action have examined 35S-labeled protein interaction profiles of disease-causing pVHL mutants (9Clifford S.C. Cockman M.E. Smallwood A.C. Mole D.R. Woodward E.R. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Maher E.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M.

We therefore wished to test whether capture of collagen IV is indeed reduced by tumor-associated VHL mutations. We first tested RCC4 stable transfectants expressing HA-tagged pVHL mutants associated with sporadic CCRC, type 2A VHL disease, or type 2B VHL disease in anti-HA co-immunoprecipitation assays and found that all these mutations ablate the interaction of pVHL with collagen IV (Fig. 2A). We next assayed further mutations associated with types 2B and 2C VHL disease in similar co-immunoprecipitation assays following transient transfection into 293T cells and found that they also impaired collagen IV binding (Fig. 2B). Although the 2C mutants V84L and L188V retained some interaction with collagen IV, capture was substantially less than with wild type pVHL. Thus, consistent with previous observations on capture of the ∼220-kDa 35S-labeled pVHL-associated species (10Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), collagen IV capture was reduced by all types of tumor-associated VHL mutation. Because the interaction of wild type pVHL with collagen IV was clearly observed in 293T cells and was also demonstrated in 786-O and U2OS cells, 4A. Grosfeld and I. Stolze, unpublished data. these findings also indicate that the pVHL-collagen IV interaction is not restricted to RCC4 cells. VCB Complex Binds Directly to Collagen Chains—To determine whether VCB and collagen IV interact directly, we performed Far Western assays using purified recombinant VCB complex. Collagen IV and HA immunoprecipitates from RCC4-p19VHLHA cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, incubated with either VCB complex or control buffer (mock), and detected with anti-pVHL antibody (Fig. 3). The integrity of the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by immunoblotting (left panel). This experiment also demonstrated the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation of either partner. In the Far Western assay (right panels), the VCB complex interacted with a species present in collagen IV and HA (p19VHLHA), but not control immunoprecipitates. The species also co-migrated exactly with immunodetectable collagen IV (left panel) and is thus assigned as collagen IV on the basis of both mobility and immunoactivity. Hydroxylation-dependent Interaction between pVHL and Collagen IV—Given the dependence of pVHL-HIF-α interaction on prolyl hydroxylation and the extensive prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation of collagens, including collagen IV (for review see Ref. 22Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), we next tested whether the pVHL-collagen IV interaction was regulated by hydroxylation. RCC4-p19VHLHA cells were exposed to hydroxylase inhibitors and tested for effects on collagen IV capture in anti-HA immunoprecipitates (or on HA (p19VHLHA) capture in anti-collagen IV immunoprecipitates). To provide an internal positive control, effects were compared with those on capture of HIF-1α in MG132-exposed cells (Fig. 4A). Both the 2-oxoglutarate analogue DMOG and the iron chelator DFO reduced the association of pVHL with collagen IV as well as with HIF-1α. Note that these treatments also altered the mobility of collagen IV (both in the Input and collagen IV immunoprecipitates) consistent with inhibition of post-translational modification (Fig. 4A). In addition, the VCB Far Western reactivity of the collagen IV immunoprecipitates was altered by treatment of cells with DMOG and DFO (Fig. 4A), confirming the expected dependence on hydroxylation. Taken together, these findings suggest that hydroxylated collagen IV binds to VCB. To determine whether binding is competitive with HIF-α, we tested the ability of synthetic HIF-1α peptides to block the interaction of VCB with collagen IV by Far Western. Results illustrated in Fig. 4B show that the VCB-collagen IV interaction was competed by hydroxylated (HyPHIF19), but not unmodified (ProHIF19) HIF-1α peptides, suggesting that the hydroxyproline binding pocket in the β-domain of pVHL is required for the interaction (16Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J. Pugh C.W. Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Nature. 2002; 417: 975-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). pVHL Interaction with Fibrillar Collagen Chains—Collagen IV is the principal (non-fibrillar) basement membrane collagen. In common with fibrillar collagens it contains a collagenous domain of Gly-X-Y triplets, where X and Y can be any amino acid residue but are commonly proline and hydroxyproline, respectively (22Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 23Canty E.G. Kadler K.E. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1341-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Following hydroxylation this domain folds into the triple helical conformation that is found in mature collagens. We next sought to determine whether pVHL binding was restricted to collagen IV or whether it could bind other collagens, including the folded triple helix. To address this, 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing either complete or truncated collagen chains and VHLHA. Interactions were tested by anti-HA immunoprecipitation, revealing association with full-length α-chains of collagen I as well as collagen IV, but not with an isolated non-collagenous domain from collagen IV (Fig. 5A). To test for interaction with folded collagens, VCB Far Western analysis was used to screen purified preparations of ECM, including collagen IV and the fibrillar collagens type I, II, and V (Fig. 5B). Interaction with all three collagen types was detected, but only when the samples were denatured. Taken together, these findings suggest that a variety of collagen chains, but not the folded triple helix, bind pVHL directly. Interaction of Endogenous pVHL and Collagen IV—Finally, to verify the interaction between native proteins we immunoprecipitated endogenous pVHL from 293T cells and analyzed complexes using anti-collagen IV and anti-HIF-1α antibodies (Fig. 6). Specific pVHL-collagen IV and pVHL-HIF-1α interactions were observed, both of which were ablated by treatment of cells with the hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG. Interestingly, although MG132 treatment increased the abundance of pVHL-HIF-1α complexes (consistent with blocked proteasomal degradation), pVHLcollagen IV complexes were less abundant in MG132-treated cells. These results suggest that pVHL binding to collagen IV has a different function and that, at least under the conditions of elevation of hydroxylated HIF-α levels following proteasomal blockade, there is competition for cellular pVHL. Our data reveal a HIF-independent interaction between pVHL and collagen IV α-chains that is affected by a wide range of tumor-associated mutations. Although type 2C mutants retain some collagen IV binding, capture was substantially less than with wild type pVHL. These findings fit well with literature describing abnormal extracellular matrix assembly in VHL-defective cells (12Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 14Kurban G. Hudon V. Duplan E. Ohh M. Pause A. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and concordance between the mutational disruption of collagen IV binding and the ECM defect strongly suggests a causal link. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism remains unclear. pVHL does not contain a secretory leader sequence, and we found no extracellular immunoreactivity. Furthermore, pVHL does not appear to interact with native extracellular (triple helical) collagen but with unassembled intracellular collagen IV chains. Several different intracellular routes of degradation for unassembled collagen chains have been described, including proteasomal degradation (24Fitzgerald J. Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27392-27398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Gotkin M.G. Ripley C.R. Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. Bienkowski R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, despite the established function in degradation of HIF-α, we have so far been unable to demonstrate similar pVHL-dependent processing of collagen IV chains. 5N. Masson and A. Grosfeld, unpublished data. Nevertheless, our findings should provide a new lead in understanding tumor suppressor mechanisms. They also suggest that hydroxylated α-chains of collagen IV and HIF may compete for pVHL binding, potentially providing a mechanism by which cellular stresses that might enhance production of unassembled collagen chains could induce normoxic expression of HIF. Previous studies of 786-O cells have identified an interaction between pVHL and fibronectin (12Ohh M. Yauch R.L. Lonergan K.M. Whaley J.M. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Gavin B.J. Kley N. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Iliopoulos O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and it has been assumed that 35S-labeled pVHL-associated species in CCRC cells migrating at a similar (∼220 kDa) position are fibronectin. Our data indicate that, at least in RCC4 cells, the major pVHL-associated species in this region are in fact collagen IV α-chains. Interestingly, we found that 786-O cells express more fibronectin and less collagen IV than RCC4, perhaps explaining why fibronectin was identified as a pVHL-interacting protein in earlier studies of 786-O, but not in our current MS/MS analysis in RCC4 cells. Whether fibronectin interacts directly or indirectly with pVHL has been controversial (10Hoffman M.A. Ohh M. Yang H. Klco J.M. Ivan M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). However, using purified fibronectin we were able to demonstrate an interaction with VCB by Far Western specifically under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 4B). The structural and physiological implications of this finding and whether it explains previous discrepancies will require further investigation. In the MS analysis we identified peptides representing the α1- and α2-chains of collagen IV, but not other collagens. However, in further experiments using either denatured purified fibrillar collagens (I, II, and V) in VCB Far Western analysis or co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed α-chains of collagen I with VHLHA, we found interaction, suggesting that pVHL binding might not be restricted to collagen IV. Because we were unable to demonstrate interaction with the non-collagenous domain of a collagen IV α-chain and both co-immunoprecipitation and Far Western interactions were reduced by two different procollagen hydroxylase inhibitors, our results suggest that the interaction most likely occurs through the heavily hydroxylated collagenous domain. Though competition with prolyl-hydroxylated, but not unmodified, HIF peptide would be consistent with the interaction involving sites of prolyl hydroxylation within collagen, this is not proven, as both DFO and DMOG affect lysyl as well as prolyl hydroxylation. Modeling the structure of the triple helical folded collagenous domain onto the hydroxyproline binding site in the β-domain of pVHL (16Hon W.C. Wilson M.I. Harlos K. Claridge T.D. Schofield C.J.

Science. 2002; 296: 1886-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) reveals a major steric clash that would be predicted to prevent binding. In keeping with this, recombinant VCB complex did not bind native folded collagen of either fibrillar or non-fibrillar forms. In future studies it will be interesting to map the binding determinants more precisely. Notably, unlike the hydroxylated HIF-1α 19-mer peptides, a denatured (Gly-Pro-Hyp)10 peptide did not compete the interaction with collagen IV, 6A. Grosfeld, unpublished data. suggesting that the interaction determinants are more complex than the simple presence of hydroxyproline in the triplet repeat. In the wider context of tumor biology many lines of investigation have implicated collagen IV proteolysis both in tumor growth and angiogenic regulation (26Xu J. Rodriguez D. Petitclerc E. Kim J.J.

https://openalex.org/W1983993803,"The cell's failure to refold or break down abnormal polypeptides often leads to their aggregation, which could cause toxicity and various pathologies. Here we investigated cellular factors involved in protein aggregation in yeast and mammalian cells using model polypeptides containing polyglutamine domains. In yeast, a number of mutations affecting the complex responsible for formation of the endocytic vesicle reduced the aggregation. Components of the endocytic complex (EC) Sla1, Sla2, and Pan1 were seen as clusters in the polyglutamine aggregates. These proteins associate with EC at the later stages of its maturation. In contrast, Ede1 and Ent1, the elements of EC at the earlier stages, were not found in the aggregates, suggesting that late ECs are involved in polyglutamine aggregation. Indeed, stabilization of the late complexes by inhibition of actin polymerization enhanced aggregation of polypeptides with polyglutamine domains. Similarly, in mammalian cells, inhibitors of actin polymerization, as well as depletion of a mediator of actin polymerization, Arp2, strongly enhanced the aggregation. In contrast, destabilization of EC by depletion or inhibition of a scaffolding protein N-WASP effectively suppressed the aggregation. Therefore, EC appears to play a pivotal role in aggregation of cytosolic polypeptides with polyglutamine domains in both yeast and mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2106077379,"Differential isoform expression and phosphorylation of protein tau are believed to regulate the assembly and stabilization of microtubuli in fetal and adult neurons. To define the functions of tau in the developing and adult brain, we generated transgenic mice expressing the human tau-4R/2N (htau-4R) isoform on a murine tau null background, by a knockout/knockin approach (tau-KOKI). The main findings in these mice were the significant increases in hippocampal volume and neuronal number, which were sustained throughout adult life and paralleled by improved cognitive functioning. The increase in hippocampal size was found to be due to increased neurogenesis and neuronal survival. Proliferation and neuronal differentiation were further analyzed in primary hippocampal cultures from tau-KOKI mice, before and after htau-4R expression onset. In absence of tau, proliferation increased and both neurite and axonal outgrowth were reduced. Htau-4R expression suppressed proliferation, promoted neuronal differentiation, and restored neurite and axonal outgrowth. We suggest that the tau-4R isoform essentially contributes to hippocampal development by controlling proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursors."

Germline BRIP1 mutations are associated with breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. Thus, common variants in the BRIP1 are candidates for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.We used a SNP tagging approach to evaluate the association between common variants (minor allele frequency>or=0.05) in BRIP1 and the risks of breast cancer and invasive ovarian cancer. 12 tagging SNPs (tSNPs) in the gene were identified and genotyped in up to 2,270 breast cancer cases and 2,280 controls from the UK and up to 1,513 invasive ovarian cancer cases and 2,515 controls from the UK, Denmark and USA. Genotype frequencies in cases and controls were compared using logistic regression.Two tSNPs showed a marginal significant association with ovarian cancer: Carriers of the minor allele of rs2191249 were at reduced risk compared with the common homozygotes (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82-1.0), P-trend = 0.045) and the minor allele of rs4988344 was associated with increased risk (OR = 1.15 (95%CI, 1.02-1.30), P-trend = 0.02). When the analyses were restricted to serous ovarian cancers, these effects became slightly stronger. These results were not significant at the 5% level after adjusting for multiple testing. None of the tSNPs was associated with breast cancer.It is unlikely that common variants in BRIP1 contribute significantly to breast cancer susceptibility. The possible association of rs2191249 and rs4988344 with ovarian cancer risks warrant confirmation in independent case-control studies."

These MAPKs are responsible for transmitting extracellular signals from the membrane to the nucleus, which leads to the phosphorylation of several transcription factors and the regulation of genes involved in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, apoptosis, motility, and metabolism (1Yang S.H.

Although MAPKs are conserved evolutionary pathways present in eukaryotic cells, the kinetics of activation and their subcellular compartmentalization is cell type-specific, and they orchestrate differential cellular responses. For example, in neuronal cells, sustained MAPK activation of even days is required for cellular activation or differentiation, whereas in fibroblasts activation of this kinase family is very short. In contrast, to achieve proliferation, extended activation of MAPKs is required in these cells (2Kolch W. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Macrophages differentiate and proliferate in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). However, the proliferation of these cells is blocked when they are activated by Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or by IFN-γ (4Xaus J. Cardo M. Valledor A.F. Soler C. Lloberas J. Celada A.

Macrophage response to M-CSF and LPS involves the phosphorylation of the three members of the MAPK family (5Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). The correct spatiotemporal regulation of MAPK signaling activation is crucial in determining cellular responses to growth or activating factors (6Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar, 7Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In our cellular model, an early peak of ERK activity (5 min) correlated with cellular proliferation, whereas a later peak (15 min) was associated with the activation program (7Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Also, the length of ERK activation is critical. For proliferation, ERK must be dephosphorylated ∼15 min after activation (7Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A number of conditions that elongate ERK activity, for example extracellular matrix proteins such as decorin or fibrinogen or treatment with cyclosporin A or FK506, reduce proliferation (8Xaus J. Comalada M. Cardo M. Valledor A.F. Celada A. Blood. 2001; 98: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Comalada M. Valledor A.F. Sanchez-Tillo E. Umbert I. Xaus J. Celada A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MAPK phosphatases (MKPs or DUSP) are responsible for dephosphorylating tyrosine and threonine residues of MAPKs. Eleven MKP family members have been identified thus far, these differing in tissue-specific expression, subcellular localization, post-translational regulation, and substrate specificity within the MAPK family (10Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Of these, nuclear MKP1, also termed DUSP1, is encoded by an immediate-early response gene induced in macrophages upon stimulation with M-CSF (11Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar) or LPS (12Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Comalada M. Soler C. Celada A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although MKP1 was initially identified as an in vitro ERK-specific phosphatase, depending on the cell type it also dephosphorylates other members of the MAPK family such as JNK and p38, thus suppressing signaling downstream of these kinases (10Farooq A. Zhou M.M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of Mkp1 has shown that this phosphatase is a pivotal feedback control regulator of the innate immune response (13Chi H. Barry S.P. Roth R.J. Wu J.J. Jones E.A. Bennett A.M.

Consequently, the mechanisms responsible for regulating Mkp1 expression are determinant for controlling the length of MAPK responses in macrophages. In some cell types, such as fibroblasts, Mkp1 induction is dependent on ERK-1/2 activation (17Brondello J.M. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1368-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 18Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 639-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Results from our group show that the activation of the MEK/ERK-1/2 cascade is not required for the induction of Mkp1 in macrophages (11Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar, 12Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Comalada M. Soler C. Celada A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In those studies, we also found that of all the protein kinase C isoforms expressed in macrophages, only PKCϵ was involved in Mkp1 transcriptional induction by M-CSF or LPS and, consequently, in the negative control of ERK activity (11Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar, 12Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Comalada M. Soler C. Celada A. J.

Commun. 2003; 303: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that Raf-1 activation is required for Mkp1 expression in macrophages and follows the different kinetics of induction by M-CSF and LPS in these cells (21Sanchez-Tillo E. Comalada M. Farrera C. Valledor A.F. Lloberas J. Celada A. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 6594-6602Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we studied the role of all MAPK family members in the regulation of MKP1 in primary cultures of macrophages. Only JNK, and specifically the JNK1 isoform, was involved in Mkp1 induction by both M-CSF and LPS, thus regulating the activation profile of the other MAPKs. In addition, we demonstrate that JNK1 mediates the expression of NOS2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines during LPS and TNF-α activation. Our results show that the JNK1 isoform plays a crucial role in macrophage biology. Reagents—LPS, actinomycin D, propidium iodide, wortmannin, LY294002, anti-ERKP Thr-183/Tyr-185, and anti-β-actin antibodies (Abs) were from Sigma. In several experiments, the results obtained with commercial LPS were compared with highly purified LPS from Salmonella abortus equi, kindly donated by Dr. C. Galanos (Max Planck Institute, Freiburg, Germany (22Huber M. Kalis C. Keck S. Jiang Z. Georgel P. Du X. Shamel L. Sovath S. Mudd S. Beutler B. Galanos C. Freudenberg M.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) and no differences were found. Recombinant M-CSF and IFN-γ were from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Murine TNF-α was obtained from Peprotech (London, UK). The p38P (Thr-180/Tyr-182) MAPK Ab was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The anti-JNK1, JNK, and MKP1 Abs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD98059, GF109203X, SB2030580, SP600125, JNK inhibitor II, and NOS2 Abs were from Calbiochem. Secondary horseradish peroxidase anti-mouse (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and anti-rabbit (Sigma) Abs were also used. Cell Culture—Bone marrow macrophages were obtained from 6-week-old BALB/c mice (Harlan Ibérica, Barcelona, Spain) and cultured as described previously (23Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Macrophages were cultured for 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker-Cambrex, Emerainville, France), supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30% L-cell conditioned media. Macrophages (80–90% confluent) were synchronized by culture with 10% fetal calf serum for 18 h (23Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Macrophages from Jnk1, Jnk2, and Mkp1 knock-out (KO) mice (24Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) were obtained in the same way. For the experiments with these mice, we used the corresponding background mouse controls. Animal use was approved by the Animal Research Committee of the University of Barcelona (Approval Number 2523). Cell Surface Staining—Analysis of cell surface receptors was performed as described (26Herrero C. Marques L. Lloberas J. Celada A. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with primary antibodies against Ly-71 (F4/80) and CD11b (Mac-1) fluorescein isothiocyanate Abs (eBioscience, San Diego) after blocking Fcγ receptors with anti-CD16/CD32 (FcγIII/II receptor) Ab (Pharmingen). Detection was done directly or after incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde solution before flow cytometry analysis (Epics XL, Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Each figure is representative of three independent experiments with triplicates expressed as the mean ± S.D. Dead cells, detected through low forward and side light scatter, were excluded. Blocking and direct incubation with secondary Ab was used as negative control. Apoptosis Assay—Cell viability was assessed by particle counting using FACS (Coulter Multisizer II, Midland, Canada) and confirmed by trypan blue exclusion. Cell death was also assessed by FACS analysis using the rAnnex V-FITC kit (Bender MedSystems, Burlingame, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Actinomycin D was used as a positive control of apoptosis. Each point was performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean value ± S.D. Proliferation Assay—After 24 h of treatment, cells were pulsed with [3H]dThd (1 μCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) for 6 h as described previously (27Celada A. Maki R.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1102-1105PubMed Google Scholar). Each point was performed in triplicate, and the results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle was analyzed as described (4Xaus J. Cardo M. Valledor A.F. Soler C. Lloberas J. Celada A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with EtOH 95%, incubated with propidium iodide plus RNase A, and then analyzed by FACS. Cell cycle distributions were analyzed with the Multicycle program (Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc., San Diego). Western Blot Analysis—Total cytoplasmic extracts were made by lysing cells as described previously (4Xaus J. Cardo M. Valledor A.F. Soler C. Lloberas J. Celada A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences). After blocking, incubation with primary Abs and secondary Ab was performed. The detection of the bands was done using the EZ-ECL kit (Biological Industries, Kibbutz beit Haemek, Israel) and by exposure to x-ray films (Agfa, Mortsel, Belgium). β-Actin was used as a loading control. Analysis of maximal expression was determined with a molecular analyst system (Bio-Rad). In-gel Kinase Assay—ERK activity was analyzed as described previously using 50–100 μg of total protein obtained as described above and separated by 12.5% SPD-PAGE containing 0.1 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate co-polymerized in the gel (7Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After several washes, denaturing, and renaturing, a phosphorylation assay was performed with 50 μm ATP and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). JNK Activity Assay—JNK activity was measured as described previously (28Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose and anti-JNK1 or anti-JNK2 Ab. After several washes, the reaction was performed with 1 μg of GST·c-Jun-(1–169) (MBL, Woburn, MA) as JNK substrate, 20 μm ATP and 1μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. SDS-PAGE was performed and the gel exposed to Agfa x-ray films. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted with the RNA kit EZ-RNA (Biological Industries). 10–15 μg of the RNA extract was separated in agarose gel containing formaldehyde and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Probes for Mkp1, IL-6, IL-1β, Tnf-α, and 18S were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) using the random prime labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). 18S was used as the loading control. Real-time PCR—cDNA was obtained from 1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV, Promega, Madison, WI) as described (29Marques L. Brucet M. Lloberas J. Celada A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for Mkp1, Tnf-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NOS2 were designed with the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems). The primers were the following: for β-actin, 5′-ACTATTGGCAACGACCGGTTT-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAGGCTGGAAAAGAGGG-3′; for NOS2, 5′-GCCACCAACAATGGCAACA-3′ and 5′-CGTACCGGATGAGCTGTGAATT-3′; for c-jun, 5′-TGAAAGCGCAAAACTCCGAG-3′ and 5′-GCACCCACTGTTAACGTGGTTTC-3′; for Tnf-α, 5′-CCTTGTTGCCTCCTCTTTTGC-3′ and 5′-TCAGTGATGTAGCGACAGCCTG-3′; for IL-1β, 5′-CCTGTGTTTTCCTCCTTGCCT-3′ and 5′-GCCTAATGTCCCCTTGAATCAA-3′; for IL-6, 5′-CAGAAGGAGTGGCTAAGGACCA-3′ and 5′-ACGCACTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAG-3′; for Jnk1, 5′-GATTTTGGACTGGCGAGGACT-3′ and 5′-TAGCCCATGCCGAGAATGA-3′; for Jnk2, 5′-TGATTGATCCAGACAAGCGG-3′ and 5′-AAATTTGAGGTGGTGGCGC-3′; for Jnk-3, 5′-AAACTACGTGGAGAATGCGCC-3′ and 5′-TGGCTTGGCTGGCTTTAAGT-3′ and for Mkp1, 5′-GGACAACCACAAGGCAGACATC-3′ and 5′-GGCCTGGCAATGACAAACA-3′. Real-time PCR was carried out with 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix using the ABI Prism 7900 detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA). Thermal cycling conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 35 cycles. Data were expressed as relative mRNA values normalized to β-actin expression levels in each sample. Statistical Analysis—To calculate the statistical differences between control and treated samples, we used the Student's paired t test. Values of p < 0.05 or lower were considered significant. JNK Is Required for the Induction of Mkp1 Expression by M-CSF or LPS—Although ERK-1/2 activation is required for both macrophage proliferation and activation, the differential kinetics of their phosphorylation/dephosphorylation correlates with specific macrophage responses (7Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In macrophages stimulated with M-CSF or LPS, the induction of MKP1 correlates with the dephosphorylation of ERK-1/2 (11Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar, 12Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Comalada M. Soler C. Celada A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because of inefficient transfection of primary cultures of macrophages (30Celada A. Borras F.E. Soler C. Lloberas J. Klemsz M. van Beveren C. McKercher S. Maki R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of MAPK activation on MKP1 induction by means of specific inhibitors. PD098059, SB203580, and SP600125 have been used extensively as selective inhibitors of the activation of MEK/ERK, p38, and all JNK isoforms, respectively (31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar, 32Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar, 33Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). These compounds also inhibited MAPKs in our macrophage model (data not shown). To test the effect of MAPKs on Mkp1 induction by M-CSF or LPS, we inhibited each MAPK separately. No effect was found when p38 or ERK-1/2 was inhibited (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, JNK activation was required for MKP1 protein expression (Fig. 1C and 1D). Northern blot analysis showed that the inhibition of JNK blocked the induction of Mkp1 mRNA (Fig. 1, E and F). Similar results were obtained by real-time PCR (data not shown). Because the half-life of Mkp1 mRNA is short (34Lin Y.W. Yang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we examined whether the decrease in the level of mRNA was due to inhibition of mRNA production or to an increase in its degradation. For this purpose, we measured the rate of mRNA degradation in the presence or absence of JNK inhibitors. Cells were treated for 30 min with M-CSF or LPS, and actinomycin D was then added at a concentration (5 μg/ml) sufficient to block all further RNA synthesis as determined by [3H]UTP incorporation (35Celada A. Maki R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated at 15, 30, and 60 min after the addition of actinomycin D, which allowed us to estimate the half-life of Mkp1. These mRNAs are highly unstable, and JNK inhibition did not alter the half-life (Fig. 1, G and H), which indicates that the reduction in mRNA levels was due to a decrease at the transcriptional level. To determine the nonselective effects of SP600125, we used the inactive analogue JNK inhibitor II (33Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar). At the same concentration (25 μm) at which SP600125 inhibited the expression of Mkp1, no effect was observed when we used the JNK inhibitor II (data not shown). Inhibition of JNK Activation Causes an Elongation of Phosphorylation of other MAPKs—In macrophages treated with either M-CSF or LPS, SP600125 did not modify the induction of ERK-1/2 activation, as determined by in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 2A) and by Western blot using specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form (Fig. 2B). Although the initial activation of these kinases was not modified, the length of activation was prolonged, thereby showing an effect of JNK inhibition on the other MAPKs. Similar effects were observed on p38 phosphorylation induced by M-CSF (Fig. 2C). For LPS, the SP600125 treatment modified the kinetics of activation by slowly delaying and prolonging activation of p38 (Fig. 2D). Cell incubation with SP600125 alone did not induce activation of ERK or p38 (data not shown). However, when we tested the involvement of ERK or p38 in JNK activation, no modifications were detected (Fig. 2, E and F). Taken together, these results indicate that JNK activity is not required for the initial activation of the other MAPKs, but it does control the duration of their activity through induction of Mkp1. JNK Is Required for LPS-dependent Activation—We also studied the role of JNK during LPS activation. Total RNA of macrophages pretreated with SP600125 and then stimulated with LPS was analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (Fig. 3A). The expression of Tnf-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 was severely compromised when JNK activity was inhibited. These results were confirmed using real-time PCR (data not show). Furthermore, SP600125 treatment caused a substantial reduction of LPS-induced NOS2 protein expression (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that JNK activation mediates several events in the macrophage inflammatory response to LPS. To establish whether the role of JNK in cytokine induction was a direct effect or was mediated through MKP1 regulation, we used macrophages from mice with disrupted Mkp1 (24Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, JNK activation in response to LPS was not impaired (Fig. 3C). The LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was analyzed using Northern blots (Fig. 3D). An increased expression of Tnf-α was detected in Mkp1 KO macrophages, thereby confirming the results of other authors (13Chi H. Barry S.P. Roth R.J. Wu J.J. Jones E.A. Bennett A.M. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2274-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 14Salojin K.V. Owusu I.B. Millerchip K.A. Potter M. Platt K.A. Oravecz T. J.

Med. 2006; 203: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This observation demonstrates that the effects of JNK during LPS activation are not due to impaired Mkp1 regulation. JNK1 Is Required for Mkp1 Induction by LPS or M-CSF—To date, 10 isoforms resulting from three encoding genes of Jnk, namely Jnk1, Jnk2, and Jnk3, have been characterized (36Barr R.K. Bogoyevitch M.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 1047-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 37Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Jnk1 and Jnk2 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas Jnk3 is restricted to brain, testis, and heart (37Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar, 39Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). We studied the JNK isoforms predominantly expressed when macrophages proliferate or become activated by LPS. Using PCR with specific primer pairs, the mRNA levels of each isoform were determined. Jnk1 and Jnk2 were constitutively expressed (Fig. 4A). However, Jnk3 was not detected in macrophages even after treatment with M-CSF (Fig. 4A) or LPS (data not shown). Therefore, we focused our studies on the activation of these isoforms. The specificity of the antibodies was tested using the KOs for Jnk1, Jnk2, and Jnk3. For JNK1, two distinct protein products were detected. Although p46 was constitutively present, p54 was detected preferentially after stimulation with M-CSF (Fig. 4B). For JNK2, only p54 was detected, and this protein was not modified by treatments with M-CSF, LPS, or TNF-α (Fig. 4C). To evaluate the JNK isoform that is active during proliferation or activation, we immunoprecipitated the anti-JNK isoform and then performed phosphorylation assays using c-Jun as substrate. Both stimuli, LPS and M-CSF, induced strong activation of the JNK1 isoform with a similar time course (Fig. 4D). Under these experimental conditions no JNK2 activity was detected. The results thus far have suggested that the JNK1 isoform is involved in the transcription of Mkp1 induced by M-CSF and LPS. To corroborate these results, we performed studies with Jnk1 and Jnk2 single KO mice. First, the maturation of bone marrow-derived macrophages was characterized measuring F4/80 and Mac-1 surface expression as markers of macrophage terminal differentiation (40McKnight A.J.

https://openalex.org/W2031586267,"K(ATP) channels are involved in regulating coronary function, but the contribution of endothelial K(ATP) channels remains largely uncharacterized. We generated a transgenic mouse model to specifically target endothelial K(ATP) channels by expressing a dominant negative Kir6.1 subunit only in the endothelium. These animals had no obvious overt phenotype and no early mortality. Histologically, the coronary endothelium in these animals was preserved. There was no evidence of increased susceptibility to ergonovine-induced coronary vasospasm. However, isolated hearts from these animals had a substantially elevated basal coronary perfusion pressure. The K(ATP) channel openers, adenosine and levcromakalim, decreased the perfusion pressure whereas the K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide failed to produce a vasoconstrictive response. The inducible endothelial nitric oxide pathway was intact, as evidenced by vasodilation caused by bradykinin. In contrast, basal endothelin-1 release was significantly elevated in the coronary effluent from these hearts. Treatment of mice with bosentan (endothelin-1 receptor antagonist) normalized the coronary perfusion pressure, demonstrating that the elevated endothelin-1 release was sufficient to account for the increased coronary perfusion pressure. Pharmacological blockade of K(ATP) channels led to elevated endothelin-1 levels in the coronary effluent of isolated mouse and rat hearts as well as enhanced endothelin-1 secretion from isolated human coronary endothelial cells. These data are consistent with a role for endothelial K(ATP) channels to control the coronary blood flow by modulating the release of the vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1."
https://openalex.org/W2157007010,"Background Chemo- and radiotherapeutic responses of leukemia cells are modified by integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms by which β1 integrins confer radiation and chemoresistance, HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells stably transfected with β1 integrin and A3 Jurkat T-lymphoma cells deficient for Fas-associated death domain protein or procaspase-8 were examined. Methodology/Principal Findings Upon exposure to X-rays, Ara-C or FasL, suspension and adhesion (fibronectin (FN), laminin, collagen-1; 5–100 µg/cm2 coating concentration) cultures were processed for measurement of apoptosis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), caspase activation, and protein analysis. Overexpression of β1 integrins enhanced the cellular sensitivity to X-rays and Ara-C, which was counteracted by increasing concentrations of matrix proteins in association with reduced caspase-3 and -8 activation and MTP breakdown. Usage of stimulatory or inhibitory anti β1 integrin antibodies, pharmacological caspase or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, coprecipitation experiments and siRNA-mediated β1 integrin silencing provided further data showing an interaction between FN-ligated β1 integrin and PI3K/Akt for inhibiting procaspase-8 cleavage. Conclusions/Significance The presented data suggest that the ligand status of β1 integrins is critical for their antiapoptotic effect in leukemia cells treated with Ara-C, FasL or ionizing radiation. The antiapoptotic actions involve formation of a β1 integrin/Akt complex, which signals to prevent procaspase-8-mediated induction of apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent manner. Antagonizing agents targeting β1 integrin and PI3K/Akt signaling in conjunction with conventional therapies might effectively reduce radiation- and drug-resistant tumor populations and treatment failure in hematological malignancies."

By inference from the crystal structure of psToc34, a homologue in pea, the arginine at residue 130 (Arg130) has been implicated in the formation of the atToc33 dimer and in intermolecular GTPase activation within the dimer. Here we report the crystal structure at 3.2-Å resolution of an atToc33 mutant, atToc33(R130A), in which Arg130 was mutated to alanine. Both in solution and in crystals, atToc33(R130A) was present in its monomeric form.

Soll J. Plant J. 1995; 7: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Toc159 consists of an acidic N-terminal domain, followed by a GTPase domain homologous to that of Toc34, and a membrane-protected C-terminal domain (11Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Toc159 and Toc34 function as the initial receptors for incoming precursor molecules. Non-hydrolyzable GTP analogues severely inhibit precursor binding to chloroplasts (12Young M.E. Keegstra K. Froehlich J.E. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has also been shown in vitro that the sequential transfer of precursors between these two receptors is regulated by GTP hydrolysis (14Becker T. Jelic M. Vojta A. Radunz A. Soll J. Schleiff E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 520-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Targeting of the two receptors themselves to chloroplasts is also dependent on GTP (15Tsai L.-Y. Tu S.-L. Li H.-m. J. Biol.

Therefore activation and regulation of the GTPase activity of these two receptors are critical for protein import into chloroplasts. Previously we have reported the crystal structure of the GTPase domain of psToc34 (20Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li Hm H.M. Tu S.L. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have shown that psToc34 forms a dimeric structure resembling a small GTPase complexed with a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), with arginine 133 of one monomer contacting the β-phosphate of the other monomer. We therefore proposed that arginine 133 functions as a GTPase-activating “arginine finger.” However, it has recently been shown that a mutant form of atToc33, atToc33(R130A), in which the arginine 130 residue (corresponding to psToc34 arginine 133) was mutated to alanine, had a reduced dimerization ability but the same GTPase activity as wild-type atToc33 (21Weibel P. Hiltbrunner A. Brand L. Kessler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37321-37329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It was therefore concluded that the GTPase activity of atToc33 was not activated by dimerization, and Arg130 did not function as an arginine finger. Here we report the crystal structure of atToc33(R130A) and show that it indeed formed a monomeric structure. No significant amount of dimer could be detected in solution. In contrast, wild-type atToc33 and psToc159 GTPase domain were able to form dimers in solution whose GTPase activity was much higher than that of either their monomeric forms or atToc33(R130A). Therefore dimer formation is important for GTPase activity of atToc33 and psToc159. We also report the important role of magnesium ion in preserving the quaternary structure of these Toc GTPases. Construction of Plasmids Encoding atToc33, psToc159, and atToc33(R130A) GTPase Domain—The coding regions for residues 1-256 of atToc33 and residues 700-1057 of psToc159, which correspond to their GTPase domain, were amplified from their cDNA clones (22Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. von Heijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Vidi P.A. Infanger S. Weibel P. Hohwy M. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using primers with an NdeI site at the N terminus and a HindIII site at the C terminus. Amplified fragments were digested with NdeI and HindIII and subcloned into the NdeI/HindIII site of pET22b, resulting in translational fusion of the His6 tag to the C terminus of atToc33-(1-256) and psToc159-(700-1057). The atToc33-(1-256)R130A mutant was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) on the plasmid encoding atToc33-(1-256). The three proteins produced, wild-type atToc33-(1-256)-His6, psToc159-(700-1057)-His6, and atToc33-(1-256)R130A-His6, are herein referred to as atToc33wt, psToc159G, and atToc33(R130A), respectively. Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmids for protein expression were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Expression of proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside after A600 of the culture reached ≈0.6. The cells were further cultured at 37 °C for another 3 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in Ni-NTA column binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole), and lysed under high pressure using a microfluidizer. The clear cell lysate obtained after centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Novagen). Proteins were eluted from the affinity resin by an elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, and 150 mm imidazole (for atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A)) or 100 mm imidazole (for psToc159G), at pH 7.9. A yield of ∼20 mg/liter culture was obtained for both atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A) and 50 mg/liter culture for psToc159G. Gel Filtration—Gel filtration experiments were performed on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex™ 75 preparation grade columns connected to an AKTA-Purifier FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to protein loading, the column was equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES and 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.0) without MgCl2 or with 2 mm or 100 mm MgCl2. Before loading, protein solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm filters. Small peaks are sometime observed in the void volume and might be caused by aggregation of small quantity of proteins. Molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences) previously run in the same column were used to determine molecular masses of sample proteins by elution comparison. GTPase Assays—GTPase assays were performed as described elsewhere (24DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Parham P. Hill B.L. Cell. 1990; 62: 875-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.0 μg of proteins, 1.7 nm [γ-32P]GTP (1 μCi) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and 200 μm GTP with 0, 2, or 100 mm MgCl2 as specified for each figure. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by addition of 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA. A fraction of the stopped reaction (0.35 μl) from each sample was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Sigma-Aldrich) and developed in 1.0 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. The plates were air-dried, and spots corresponding to GTP and Pi were quantified using a phosphorimager (Fuji FLA-5000). For comparison of the GTPase activity of atToc33wt and psToc159G in different quaternary structures, peak fractions separated by gel filtration were used. Crystallization of the atToc33(R130A)-GDP Complex—Solubility of atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A) was very low, and both proteins tended to precipitate at a concentration above 2 mg/ml. We found that adding 50 mm imidazole to the buffer could raised the solubility of atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A) to concentrations of 8 mg/ml and 6 mg/ml, respectively. Prior to crystallization trials, atToc33(R130A) protein was dialyzed against a buffer of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 50 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, under slow equilibration without stirring and was concentrated using Amicon Ultra® (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) concentrators. Crystallization trials were setup with 6 mg/ml protein in the above buffer condition using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Initial screening was performed with sparse-matrix screen from Hampton Research. Preliminary crystals, which only diffracted to about 8.0 Å, appeared in the Hampton crystal screen condition containing 30% PEG 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8. To improve crystal quality, various additives were used. Addition of nicotinamide nucleotide (NAD) at 100 μm resulted in greatly improved crystal quality. The crystal grown with this additive diffracted to 3.2 Å and was used for collecting data for this report. Simultaneous attempts to crystallize atToc33wt were not successful. Data Collection and Refinement—A complete data set was collected to a resolution of 3.2 Å on a ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector using a synchrotron radiation x-ray source at Beamline 17B2 of the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan. The data were indexed and processed with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. W M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Initial phase estimates for tetragonal data were determined by molecular replacement (MR), using the previously determined psToc34 GTPase domain structure (PDB code: 1H65) as a search model. We removed Mg2+, GDP, and water molecules from the search model to calculate the phases. The program MolRep, from the CCP4 suite package, was used for molecular replacement (26Collaborative Computational Project, NActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The sequence homology between the model and atToc33(R130A) was 60%. The final molecular replacement solution that was obtained included one subunit of the asymmetric unit with an R-value of 51.0% and a correlation factor of 34.0%. The initial refinement of atToc33(R130A) was performed using CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) with standard refinement procedures, including rigid body, minimization, simulated annealing, positional, and individual temperature factor (B-factor) refinements. A total of 10% reflections were used to calculate Rfree, and all remaining reflections were used in the refinement. The iterative model improvement was carried out using the graphics programs XtalView 4.1 (28McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar), followed by further rounds of CNS refinement. Several rounds of refinement adding one GDP molecule, one Mg2+ ion, and 22 water molecules resulted in a final Rfree of 29.1% and an R-value of 22.8%.

Open table in a new tab Quaternary Structure Evaluation—The GTPase domain of wild-type atToc33, atToc33(R130A) and psToc159 was overexpressed with a C-terminal His6 tag and purified from E. coli. Hereafter, these three recombinant proteins are referred to as atToc33wt, atToc33(R130A), and psToc159G. Protein purity is shown in Fig. 1A. Gel filtration was used for initial examination of the quaternary structure. In the presence of 100 mm MgCl2, freshly prepared (see below) atToc33wt was eluted in two major peaks (Fig. 1B). By reference to molecular mass markers, peak I was determined to be the dimer form, peak II was the monomers (the shoulder of peak II might be caused by the high Mg2+ concentration, see below). In contrast, under the same condition, atToc33(R130A) was present predominantly as monomers (Fig. 1B). These gel filtration results indicated that Arg130 indeed plays an important role in the dimerization of atToc33 (20Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li Hm H.M. Tu S.L. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37321-37329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The gel filtration profile of psToc159G was similar to that of atToc33wt except the dimer:monomer ratio of psToc159G was close to 1:1 (Fig. 1C), which was higher than that observed for atToc33. GTPase Activities of atToc33, atToc33(R130A), and psToc159G—GTP hydrolysis measurements of atToc33(R130A) and different forms of atToc33wt and psToc159G separated by gel filtration were carried out to determine the effect of dimerization on their GTPase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, GTPase activity of atToc33wt dimers (peak I of Fig. 1B) was about 2-3-fold that of atToc33wt monomers (peak II of Fig. 1B). When assays were performed with unfractionated atToc33wt (i.e. atToc33wt without going through the gel filtration step), the GTPase activity was slightly higher than atToc33wt monomers. The GTPase activity of atToc33(R130A) was the same as that of atToc33wt monomers. The differences in GTPase activities were not caused by difference in protein loading, because equal amounts of proteins were used as judged from protein concentration measurements and SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 2B). Similarly, as shown in Fig. 2C, the GTPase activity of psToc159G dimers (peak I of Fig. 1C) was 2-3-fold that of psToc159G monomers (peak II of Fig. 1C). Unfractionated psToc159G had an intermediate GTPase activity. These results indicated that dimerization was important for the GTPase activity of atToc33 and psToc159G. Role of Magnesium in atToc33 Dimerization and GTPase Activity—During our GTPase assays, we noticed that atToc33wt prepared and assayed in the absence of Mg2+ had very low GTPase activities. We, therefore, further explored the relationships among Mg2+ concentrations, dimer formation, and GTPase activity of atToc33. As shown in Fig. 3A, atToc33wt prepared and assayed in the absence of Mg2+ had a very low GTPase activity. When 100 mm MgCl2 was added to the assays, the GTPase activity increased. Interestingly, when only 2 mm MgCl2 was added, which was the Mg2+ concentration Weibel et al. (21Weibel P. Hiltbrunner A. Brand L. Kessler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37321-37329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) used for GTPase assays, the atToc33wt GTPase activity was even higher (Fig. 3A). This result suggested that Mg2+ was important for atToc33wt GTPase activity but excess Mg2+ might have an inhibitory effect. Inhibition by excess Mg2+ has been observed for other GTPases (29Manne V. Kung H.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1440-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Hillebrand S. Garcia W. Delmar Cantu M. de Araujo A.P. Tanaka M. Tanaka T. Garratt R.C. Carrilho E. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2005; 383: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When analyzed by gel filtration, while atToc33wt analyzed in the presence of 2 or 100 mm MgCl2 eluted with similar dimer and monomer peaks, atToc33wt analyzed in the absence of Mg2+ eluted entirely as monomers (Fig. 3B). psToc159 was also present only as monomers in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1C). When the dimer and monomer fractions atToc33wt were further separated and assayed individually, the GTPase activities of dimers were again much higher than those of monomers (Fig. 3C). In 2 mm MgCl2, the dimer GTPase activity was almost 6-fold that of monomers. Because of the possible inhibitory effect of 100 mm MgCl2, we re-compared the GTPase activities of atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Unlike in the presence 100 mm MgCl2, in which only a small difference in the GTPase activities of unfractionated atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A) could be detected (Figs. 2A and 3D), the GTPase activity of atToc33wt was clearly higher than that of atToc33(R130A) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 3D). atToc33wt Lost the Dimer Conformation and GTPase Activity upon Storage—It needs to be pointed out that, for unknown reasons, atToc33wt dimers were observed only when the protein was fresh. To further analyze the influence of aging on atToc33wt dimer formation and GTPase activity, assays were carried out with atToc33wt stored at 4 °C or -20 °C for 1 week. Upon storage at 4 °C or -20 °C, the GTPase activity of atToc33wt was reduced to a level similar to that of monomers (Fig. 4A). Gel filtration analyses indeed showed that storage at 4 °C or -20 °C resulted in complete loss of the dimer peak (Fig. 4B). These results provided further support for the importance of dimer formation for atToc33 GTPase activity. Overall Structure of atToc33(R130A)—To provide insight into the structure/function relationship of atToc33, we performed structural studies of atToc33wt and atToc33(R130A). However, crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction were only obtained from atToc33(R130A). Failure to obtain crystals of atToc33wt may be because of its presence in dual conformations in solution as shown in Fig. 1B, in which one conformation may act as a biological contaminant to the other, leading to failures during the crystallization trials. The atToc33(R130A) crystal belonged to the P43212 space group, with cell dimensions a = b = 71.52 Å and c = 106.27 Å, and diffracted to 3.2 Å. Unlike psToc34, which belongs to the C2 space group with three molecules per asymmetric unit and forms a dimer each with adjacent monomer (20Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li Hm H.M. Tu S.L. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the crystal of atToc33(R130A) contained single molecules packed as a monomer in an asymmetric unit. Other than being a monomer, atToc33(R130A) shared major characteristics with psToc34 in terms of overall structure since the two proteins have a 59% amino acid sequence identity (Figs. 5 and 6A). The atToc33(R130A) structure we report here comprises amino acids 2-250. For comparison purpose, secondary structural elements of atToc33(R130A) were numbered according to the structure of psToc34 (20Sun Y.J. Forouhar F. Li Hm H.M. Tu S.L. Yeh Y.H. Kao S. Shr H.L. Chou C.C. Chen C. Hsiao C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The atToc33(R130A) structure is composed of eight β-strands flanked by nine α-helices. The C-terminal helix α7 (residues 252-256), which is present in the psToc34 structure, is absent in atToc33(R130A).FIGURE 6Ribbon structure of the GDP-bound atToc33(R130A) monomer and stereo view of the superposition of the Cα position of atToc33(R130A) and psToc34 G domains.

C, magnified view of the GDP binding pocket region of B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the monomer structure of atToc33(R130A) highly resembles the monomer structure of psToc34, there are some structural variations between the two proteins. According to the structure of psToc34, the dimer interface is composed of four elements: switch I, switch II, the loop (residues 129-134) between the β4-strand and the α3-helix, and the α4′-helix (residues 163-169). The superimposition of atToc33(R130A) and psToc34 shows significant differences in all of these regions (Fig. 6B). The α4′-helix of psToc34 was present in atToc33(R130A) as an extended coil rather than a helix. These differences in interface structure may force atToc33(R130A) to exist as a monomer, rather than a dimer. In addition, we did not observe the β3′-strand that was present in the psToc34 structure. Instead this region is an extended coil in atToc33(R130A). Another small variation was observed in the region of residues 200 to 202, which forms the small 310 helix (α5′) in psToc34, but forms an extended α-helix (α6) in atToc33(R130A) (Figs. 5 and 6A). We also observed that switch I in atToc33(R130A) lies closer to the GDP moiety than it does in psToc34. However, without the atToc33wt structure, it is not clear whether these differences were caused by the overall sequence differences between psToc34 and atToc33, or caused by the R130A mutation. Structural Comparison of atToc33(R130A) and psToc34 in the GDP Binding Region—In the psToc34 dimer structure, the guanine group of GDP is strengthened by the dimer interface. The sugar ring of GDP in one monomer is supported by residues Pro169, Asp170, and Tyr132 from the other monomer via van der Waals and hydrophobic forces. In the atToc33(R130A) monomer structure, significant variations were observed in the conformation of GDP. The guanosine group of GDP acquires a different orientation (Fig. 6C) to interact more with interior residues of the monomer by hydrogen bonding. For instance, the guanine group interacts with Asn209 by one hydrogen bond. However, the α- and β-phosphates of GDP in atToc33(R130A) are organized in a similar way as that of GDP in psToc34. In psToc34, six residues (Gly49, Gly51, Lys52, Ser53, Ser54, and Ser68) are involved in stabilization of the phosphate groups, whereby five residues hydrogen bond with GDP, and Lys52 stabilizes the negative charge of the phosphates by forming salt bridges. Similarly, in atToc33(R130A) all the corresponding residues (Gly46, Gly48, Lys49, Ser50, Ser51, and Ser65 in atToc33) are engaged in stabilizing the phosphate groups. Aronsson et al. (31Aronsson H. Combe J. Jarvis P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) has shown that the atToc33(E208Q) mutant, in which the glutamic acid at residue 208 was mutated to glutamine, had the same nucleotide specificity and GTPase activity, but weaker nucleotide binding, compared with wildtype atToc33. In agreement with these results, in the crystal structure of atToc33(R130A) we observed that Glu208 forms a strong hydrogen bond with the O6 of the guanine group of GDP, suggesting that, while this residue may not influence the GTPase activity or nucleotide specificity, it may still play some role in the stabilization of GDP in the binding site. Molecular Modeling of atToc33 Dimers—Because the structure of atToc33wt was not obtained, we performed molecular modeling to generate an architectural dimer of atToc33wt using the psToc34 dimer structure as a probe. The monomer of atToc33(R130A) was superimposed onto each monomer in the psToc34 dimer, alanine at residue 130 was replaced with an arginine, and energy minimization was performed using CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). Around the GDP binding site of the atToc33wt architectural dimer (Fig. 7), Arg130 from one monomer interacts with the β-phosphate of GDP in the other monomer by a strong hydrogen bond. This interaction is the same as seen with Arg133 in psToc34. We also observed stabilization of the hydrophobic binding pocket by Tyr129 and hydrophobic stacking force by His158. In addition, the buried surface area of the psToc34 dimer and the atToc33 architectural dimer is ∼2750 Å2 and ∼2570 Å2, respectively. The similar buried surface area suggests that atToc33wt in its dimer conformation may resemble the psToc34 dimer. However, despite the similarity, psToc34 dimers have more hydrogen bonds between the two monomers than atToc33. For example, in the psToc34 dimer structure, Arg63 forms a salt bridge with Asp170 from the other monomer, and Arg214 interacts with Ser167 from the other monomer by forming a strong hydrogen bond. In contrast, we did not observe these interactions from the corresponding positions in the atToc33wt modeled dimer structure. It is possible that the sequence and local conformational differences result in less contact in the real atToc33wt dimer. This may be one of the reasons that atToc33wt seems less stable than psToc34 since psToc34 did not lose its dimer conformation upon storage and could remain soluble under a higher protein concentration (data not shown). psToc159G was present with a higher proportion of dimers in solution than atToc33wt (Fig. 1C), and psToc159G also did not lose the dimer conformation upon storage (data not shown). To investigate the reason for the increased stability of psToc159, a psToc159 architectural dimer was also calculated based on the psToc34 structure. The buried surface area of psToc159 was calculated to be ∼3066 Å2 using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. The larger buried surface area of the psToc159G dimers might be one of the reasons for its enhanced stability in solution. Weibel et al. (21Weibel P. Hiltbrunner A. Brand L. Kessler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37321-37329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have shown that atToc33 and atToc33(R130A) hydrolyzed GTP with almost the same efficiency. Recombinant atToc33(R130A) had a reduced ability to bind in vitro-translated, 35S-labeled wild-type atToc33, atToc159, and atToc33(R130A). They therefore concluded that Arg130 merely functioned in establishing monomer-monomer interactions but did not function as a GTPase activating “arginine finger.” Our gel filtration results (Fig. 1B) showed that Arg130, in the presence of exogenous Mg2+ and in freshly prepared samples, indeed played an important role in the dimerization of atToc33wt. However when the dimer population was separated from the monomer population, both atToc33wt and psToc159G had a significantly higher GTPase activity in their dimeric form (Fig. 2). Even in unfractionated samples, atToc33wt had a significantly higher GTPase activity than atToc33(R130A) in 2 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 3D). It is possible that Weibel et al. did not assay freshly prepared samples so most of the dimers had dissociated into monomers. Although direct evidence that Arg130 functions as an arginine finger is still lacking, our data show that dimer formation is important for the GTPase activity of atToc33wt and psToc159G. In the architectural dimer of atToc33, Arg130 from one monomer contacts the β-phosphate of GDP in the other monomer. Therefore Arg130 as an arginine finger provides a logical explanation for the higher GTPase activity of atToc33 dimers. We observed that atToc33wt and psToc159G could not form dimers in the absence of exogenous Mg2+ (Figs. 1C and 3B). This is not because of depletion of Mg2+ from the GDP binding pocket of each atToc33 molecule since Mg2+ was still present in the atToc33(R130A) monomer structure (Fig. 6A). In a recent study (32Scrima A. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2940-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with MnmE, a GTPase involved in the modification of tRNA, it has been found that G-domains of MnmE dimerize in a potassium-dependent manner and induce GTP hydrolysis. In our study although potassium ion was absent in the buffer we still observed the presence of atToc33wt and psToc159G dimers in the presence of MgCl2, indicating that Mg2+ alone can influence dimerization without the help of potassium ions. It is possible that there is a second Mg2+ binding site in the atToc33 dimer, and this second Mg2+ may play a similar role as that of K+ in MnmE to enhance dimer formation. It has been shown that GTP, when added as the sodium salt, could support precursor binding to chloroplasts at low GTP concentrations (50-100 μm), but binding decreased at higher GTP concentrations (33Olsen L. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was then suspected that GTP was acting as a chelator for some required cation. Indeed when Mg2+ was added at the same concentration as GTP, precursor binding remained high even at 1 mm GTP (33Olsen L. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 433-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicate that, in vitro, Mg2+ promotes atToc33wt dimerization and psToc159G dimerization, which in turn is critical for their GTPase activities. It is likely that Mg2+ plays the same role in vivo during precursor import into chloroplasts. Therefore when Mg2+ is chelated away, dimerization and GTPase activity of atToc33 and Toc159 is inhibited, and precursors are then unable to bind to these receptor proteins. We propose that during protein import into chloroplasts, atToc33 and Toc159 may both form dimers. Their GTPase activity is then activated by this dimerization with the aid of Arg130 as the arginine finger. Although we have only shown homo-dimerization of atToc33wt, psToc159G, and psToc34 in vitro, it has been shown that atToc33 is required for targeting of atToc159 to chloroplasts (17Bauer J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44289-44297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the Toc34 and Toc159 family proteins have homologous GTPase domains. It is therefore also possible that atToc33 and atToc159 could form heterodimers. How the GTPase activity of the Toc34 and Toc159 family proteins is regulated in vivo, and whether atToc33 and Toc159 form homodimers, heterodimers or even both, all require further investigations.

Although the structure of the GluR2 binding domain (S1S2) is well known (agonist binding site between two lobes), little is known about the time scales of conformational transitions or the relationship between dynamics and function. 19F NMR (19F-labeled tryptophan) spectroscopy was used to monitor motions in the S1S2 domain bound to ligands with varying efficacy and in the apo state. One tryptophan (Trp-671) undergoes chemical exchange in some but not all agonists, consistent with μs-ms motion. The dynamics can be correlated to ligand affinity, and a likely source of the motion is a peptide bond capable of transiently forming hydrogen bonds across the lobe interface. Another tryptophan (Trp-767) appears to monitor motions of the relative positions of the lobes and suggests that the relative orientation in the apo- and antagonist-bound forms can exchange between at least two conformations on the ms time scale.

Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar) and play important roles in the formation of synaptic plasticity underlying higher order processes such as learning and memory as well as in neuronal development (2Asztely F. Gustafsson B. Mol. Neurobiol. 1996; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, ionotropic GluRs have been implicated in various neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, Huntington chorea, and neurologic disorders including epilepsy and ischemic brain damage. Antagonists of glutamate receptors have been shown to limit tumor growth in a variety of human tumors and to inhibit tumor cell migration (3Rzeski W. Turski L. Ikonomidou C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6372-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In recent years many advances in characterizing the relationship between ionotropic GluR structure and function have been made. Ionotropic GluRs are membrane-bound receptor ion channels composed of multiple subunits arranged as a rosette, forming a central ion channel in which each subunit contributes to pore formation. Individual subunits are categorized by pharmacological properties, sequence, functionality, and biological roles into those that are sensitive 1) to the synthetic agonist N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NR1, NR2A-D, NR3A-B), 2) to the synthetic agonist α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA; GluR1–4), and 3) to the naturally occurring neurotoxin kainate (GluR5–7, KA1,2). The structural analysis of glutamate receptors was dramatically advanced by the finding that the extracellular agonist binding domain (S1S2 domain) could be expressed in isolation as a soluble protein (4Arvola M. Keinänen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15527-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and by the subsequent solution of the crystal structure bound to kainate (5Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). As predicted by homology models (6Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Wo Z.G. Oswald R.E. Method Enzymol. 1998; 293: 589-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the S1S2 domain was found to be a bilobed structure with the agonist binding pocket located between the two lobes. The first glimpse of the structural basis of channel activation was the finding by Armstrong and Gouaux (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) that the apo state exhibited a considerably larger angle between the two lobes than the full agonist-bound state, and at least for kainate relative to full agonists, the degree of lobe closure correlates with agonist efficacy. Furthermore, the dimer interface, and in particular the stability of the interface, seems to control desensitization. That is, the dissociation of the dimer interface leads to desensitization (8Armstrong N. Jasti J. Beich-Frandsen M. Gouaux E. Cell. 2006; 127: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), suggesting that the receptor works as a dimer of dimers, with Lobe 2 moving relative to Lobe 1 to promote channel activation (9Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Although the simplistic idea would be that the degree of lobe closure dictates the single channel conductance, numerous studies have shown that multiple conductance levels are present with both partial and full agonists (10Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 11Swanson G.T. Kamboj S.K. Cull-Candy S.G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 58-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the conductance levels are independent of the efficacy of the agonist (12Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, at saturating concentrations, high efficacy agonists preferentially exhibit the higher conductance levels, whereas partial agonists preferentially populate the lower conductance levels. This has led to the suggestion that other dynamic processes either within the S1S2 domain or downstream of the agonist binding domain are involved in controlling the channel gate (13Oswald R.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 313-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the availability of numerous crystal structures has provided many clues to the details of the coupling between binding and channel opening, little is known about the time scales of conformational transitions. This is particularly important since ligand binding and/or the control of channel function may be related to dynamic processes within S1S2. 19F NMR spectroscopy was employed as a monitor of conformational transitions in the GluR2 S1S2 domain in the presence of a variety of ligands with varying efficacy. We find that two of the four tryptophans in S1S2 (labeled with 19F) sense motions that may be related to conformational transitions associated with binding and lobe closure. Estimates of the time scales of these motions suggest that contacts across the interlobe interface can exchange on the order of μs-ms for the glutamate-, bromowillardiine-, and iodowillardiine-bound forms and that chemical exchange, likely related to dynamics of lobe closure, can occur on the time scale of ms for the apo form and the antagonist-bound form. Materials—5-Fluorotryptophan was obtained from Sigma and Fisher. Glutamate was obtained from Sigma. Quisqualate, aniracetam, AMPA, and CNQX were obtained from Tocris. The willardiine compounds were synthesized as described previously (41Jane D.E. Hoo K. Kamboj R. Deverill M. Bleakman D. Mandelzys A. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 3645-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The GluR2 S1S2J construct was obtained from Eric Gouaux (Vollum Institute; Ref. 7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Protein Preparation and Purification—The S1S2 protein was prepared as described by Furukawa and Gouaux (42Furukawa H. Gouaux E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2873-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) with modifications to incorporate fluorotryptophan as described by Salopek-Sondi and Luck (43Salopek-Sondi B. Luck L.A. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild type and mutant pET-b22(+) plasmids were transformed in Escherichia coli strain Origami B (DE3) cells and were grown at 37 °C to A600 of 0.8 in LB medium supplemented with the antibiotic. Cells were harvested, washed with M9 medium, and resuspended in M9 medium supplemented with 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% NH4Cl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.04% glucose, 1% casamino acids, 0.1% thiamine, 1% glycerol, 1 g of 19F-labeled Trp, and the antibiotics. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C to exhaust the residual Trp in the medium for 1 h (or reach A600 between 0.9 and 1.0). The cultures were cooled to 20 °C, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cultures were allowed to grow at 20 °C for 20 h. The cells were then pelleted, and the S1S2 protein was purified using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column followed by a HT-SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Glutamate (10 mm) was maintained in all buffers throughout purification. For NMR experiments, the protein was concentrated to 0.2–0.5 mm using a Centricon 10 centrifugal filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Ligands were exchanged by multiple steps of dilution and centrifugation in the Centricon filter until no peaks characteristic of the glutamate-bound form were observed in the NMR spectrum. Glutamate and kainate were used at 10 mm, and all other ligands were used at 2 mm. To produce mutants in which the tryptophans were replaced by phenylalanine leucine or valine, two primers for each mutant were custom-synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). For Trp-463 and Trp-671, site-directed mutagenesis employed the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The site-directed mutagenesis for residues 766 and 767 was carried out according to Ho et al. (44Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the BRC Biotechnology Resource Center at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY). NMR Spectroscopy—All measurements were made on Varian Inova 500 and 600 spectrometers (470 and 564 MHz for 19F). 19F measurements were made using a broadband probe (at 470 MHz) or a triple resonance gradient probe (at 564 MHz) with the proton channel down-tuned to fluorine. Unless otherwise indicated, spectra were collected at 25 °C. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe Version 1.6 (45Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar). The first five points were back-predicted using linear prediction to remove the background signal from the probe. The data were apodized with a mixed exponential-Gauss window function and zerofilled to double the original number of data points before Fourier transform. For quantitation, the peaks were fit with Gaussian functions. 19F T1 and T2 measurements were obtained by acquiring one-dimensional spectra obtained with standard Varian pulse sequences. The T2 measurements were made with a standard CPMG echo sequence (46Meiboom S. Gill D. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1958; 29: 688-691Crossref Scopus (4885) Google Scholar), and the delay was set to 0.2, 0.5, 1, or 2 ms. If chemical exchange was present and the exchange rate is in the time scale of the delays, then one would expect the T2 to vary with CPMG delay (16Luz Z. Meiboom S. J. Chem. Phys. 1963; 39: 366-370Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although the protein concentration was well below the dimerization dissociation constant (6 mm, 9), the monomeric form of the protein was verified in the NMR tube using diffusion measurements which employed pulsed field gradients (21Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Incorporation of 19F into each of the four sites was equal to within 10% as measured by integration of the peaks in the AMPA-bound spectrum. Analysis of Exchange Data—The data from the CPMG experiments for Trp-671 were analyzed using the general expression for the transverse relaxation rate for two-site exchange, which is applicable to all chemical exchange time scales (47Carver J.P.

R02A and R02B were assumed to be identical and were tested for a range of values approximating 1/T2 for Trp-766, Trp-767, and Trp-460, which did not appear to undergo chemical exchange. The fitting procedure was developed in the laboratory and used a Simplex algorithm to optimize the fit to the data. For the CNQX-bound form, the Trp-671 resonance showed clear decoalescence at lower temperatures The time constant for exchange (τ) at the decoalescence temperature can be estimated from the frequency splitting (νA - νB) at the stopped-exchange limit using Equation 6. τ(νA−νB)=(π2)−1(Eq. 6) A more detailed analysis of the line shape as a function of temperature allows for extraction of rate constants for exchange using a slightly simplified version of the McConnell equation (25McConnell H.M.

Phys. 1958; 28: 430-431Crossref Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), g(ν)=k(1+2τ/T2)P+QRP2+R2(Eq. 7) P=2τ{(1T2)2−4π2(νA−ν)(νB−ν)}+1T2(Eq. 8) Q=2πτ(νA+νB−2ν)(Eq. 9) R=π(νA+νB−2ν)(1+4τT2)(Eq. 10) where K is a constant describing maximum amplitude, τ is the average time in seconds between isomerizations (= 1/k), νA and νB are the frequencies (in Hz) of the two resonances in the absence of exchange (the “stopped exchange limit”), and T2 is the spin-spin relaxation time. To maintain the Lorentzian line shape, the data were apodized with a matched exponential before Fourier transform. The line-shape analysis was performed using IGORPro (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). The peak for Trp-671 was fit to a Lorentzian line shape and subtracted from the spectra before fitting Trp-767. The splitting between peaks was similar between 3 and 7 °C, so that the data for 3 °C was assumed to be stopped exchange (in the stopped exchange limit, τ→∞). To determine the values of νA and νB, the 3 °C spectrum was fit by fixing τ at values of 1, 0.1, and 0.03 s while allowing the other parameters to vary. Similar results for νA and νB were obtained from all three cases, with νA - νB = 98 Hz. For the higher temperature data, νA and νB were held fixed, whereas τ and the remaining parameters were allowed to vary. An additional parameter (Δν) was used in the higher temperature fits to account for chemical shift changes as a function of temperature. The Arrhenius plot was prepared from the resulting best-fit values of τ using k = 1/τ. Errors in the y axis (ln k) are given by σ=1τστ=kστ(Eq. 11) where στ is the error in τ from the fit. Values of T2 from the fits were consistent with those measured directly (Table 1) and were weakly temperature-dependent.TABLE 1Relaxation parameters (ms) All values are given in ms. Except where otherwise noted, all measurements were made at 25 °C. The values in parentheses after T2 refer to the CPMG delay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Trp-767 for the CNQX-bound form showed decoalescence and could not be fit by a single Gaussian.LigandT1T2 (0.2 ms)T2 (0.5 ms)T2 (1 ms)T2 (2 ms)msmsmsmsmsTrp-460 Glutamate7216.747.137.497.97 Glutamate (aniracetam)6547.849.0710.349.85 Glutamate (15 °C)10456.757.108.037.49 Glutamate (5 °C)10785.765.626.325.71 AMPA6247.847.939.379.62 Quisqualate6958.418.479.4110.06 Kainate7128.958.639.759.49 Bromowillardiine6688.338.299.367.587 Iodowillardiine6758.828.7610.3910.64 Iodowillardiine (aniracetam)6799.638.5110.4010.53 CNQX7068.218.979.949.72Trp-671 Glutamate7995.335.544.355.56 Glutamate (aniracetam)67710.817.688.387.67 Glutamate (15 °C)11197.116.075.755.44 Glutamate (5 °C)14236.005.845.743.76 AMPA7138.378.098.918.06 Quisqualate7278.797.977.447.52 Kainate7208.158.118.889.12 Bromowillardiine7445.985.466.213.59 Iodowillardiine7188.195.325.364.98 Iodowillardiine (aniracetam)7717.156.215.145.29 CNQX7658.489.2110.5910.38Trp-766 Glutamate10467.479.268.368.32 Glutamate (aniracetam)9127.658.469.188.53 Glutamate (15 °C)13876.287.286.977.39 Glutamate (5 °C)15345.315.175.105.71 AMPA9748.517.137.767.83 Quisqualate9678.817.798.698.65 Kainate9228.208.138.589.60 Bromowillardiine10236.317.948.236.82 Iodowillardiine9518.558.188.738.10 Iodowillardiine (aniracetam)9198.408.527.917.65 CNQX9147.897.998.858.26Trp-767 Glutamate7397.826.128.907.72 Glutamate (aniracetam)6549.008.0110.629.85 Glutamate (15 °C)10416.436.477.867.38 Glutamate (5 °C)12376.225.626.415.89 AMPA6718.308.098.527.51 Quisqualate6208.218.718.809.17 Kainate6168.929.548.688.94 Bromowillardiine6418.079.377.867.33 Iodowillardiine5948.398.638.218.85 Iodowillardiine (aniracetam)5848.938.058.698.97 Open table in a new tab Assignments—There are four Trp residues in wild type S1S2 (Fig. 1); one in Lobe 1 (Trp-460), one in Lobe 2 (Trp-671), and two in helix K (Trp-766, Trp-767) near the C terminus. Wild type S1S2 was prepared with 5-fluoro-Trp (19F-labeled Trp) amino acids substituted for natural Trp. Assignment of the 19F-labeled resonances was achieved using a combination of mutations and experiments using line-broadening agents. Four mutant constructs, each with a single 19F-labeled Trp → Phe mutation, were initially prepared. Only two mutants (W460F and W671F) produced well folded protein. Spectra of these mutants in the glutamate-bound form are shown in Fig. 2A, where the missing 19F signal relative to wild type corresponds to the mutated Trp residue. The W766F and W767F point mutations in helix K failed to produce well folded protein. However, W766V did produce a stable, well folded protein, but chemical shift changes precluded its use in assignments. No mutations of Trp-767 produced useable protein. Therefore, to assign the two 19F-labeled resonances from helix K, the differential exposure of the fluorine atoms to water was exploited. The fluorine atom of Trp-766 is solvent-exposed, whereas the fluorine atom of Trp-767 is completely buried. Thus, the addition of a paramagnetic substance such as Gd-DTPA should result in preferential broadening of the Trp-766 resonance over the Trp-767 resonance. Spectra of wild type 19F-labeled are shown in Fig. 2B as a function of Gd-DTPA concentration. Only one resonance broadens significantly; this is assigned to Trp-766. The remaining unassigned resonance is then assigned to Trp-767. The Trp-671 resonance also broadens somewhat more than those of Trp-460 and Trp-767, as its fluorine is slightly more solvent-exposed. A similar procedure was used to assign resonances in the presence of other glutamatergic ligands.FIGURE 2The strategy for assigning the 19F resonances. A, Trp-460 (top spectrum) and Trp-671 (middle spectrum) were mutated to phenylalanine. Only minor changes in the spectra were observed so that the peak that is lost can be assigned to the mutated residue. B, gadolinium is paramagnetic and increases relaxation in resonances for which it comes in close proximity. Gd:DTPA selectively broadens the resonance at –47.6 ppm. Because the crystal structure of the glutamate-bound form of S1S2 (PDB code 1ftj (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar)) indicates the Trp-766 is the tryptophan most exposed to solvent, this resonance was assigned to Trp-766. The remaining resonance at –48.2 ppm was assigned to Trp-767.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Full Agonists—19F resonances are sensitive reporters of protein structure and dynamics (14Luck L.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4248-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In particular, the 19F chemical shift is very sensitive to changes in the electronic environment due to nearby hydrogen bonds, electrostatic fields, and van der Waals contacts (15Zemsky J. Rusinova E. Nemerson Y. Luck L.A. Ross J.B. Proteins. 1999; 37: 709-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the line-shape and relaxation parameters are good reporters of subtle changes in local dynamics. The fluorine spectra at 470 MHz of 19F-labeled S1S2 bound to AMPA, quisqualate, and glutamate are shown in Fig. 3, A–C. The substitution of quisqualate or glutamate for AMPA (Fig. 3, A versus B and C) results in a significant up-field change (∼0.7 ppm) in chemical shift for Trp-767 relative to the other resonances. This is most likely because of the orientation of the isoxazole group of AMPA, which occupies subsite G, leading to the rearrangement of side chains (Tyr-405 and Met-708) in proximity to Trp-767 (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The line widths for Trp-460, Trp-766, and Trp-767 are similar regardless of the bound agonist, but that of Trp-671 is broadened only in S1S2 glutamate (Fig. 3, C and E). This broadening relative to the AMPA- and quisqualate-bound forms is consistent with the measured T2 values (Table 1), which are ∼40% lower for the glutamate-bound than for the quisqualate- and AMPA-bound forms. The line-shape and T2 differences between the glutamate-bound and the quisqualate- and AMPA-bound forms suggest a change in dynamics of either the tryptophan itself or the environment of the tryptophan. To explore this further, the T2 was measured using a CPMG sequence with delays ranging from 0.2 to 2 ms. If exchange occurs on this time scale, then the measurement of T2 should vary with the delay (16Luz Z. Meiboom S. J. Chem. Phys. 1963; 39: 366-370Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3F, no systematic variation in T2 was observed at 25 °C. An alternative explanation is that the line broadening is because of processes on the ns-ps time scale. Given the large contribution of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) to 19F relaxation, line broadening could arise from variations in the CSA on this faster time scale. If, however, the line-broadening arises from chemical exchange, variation in T2 as a function of CPMG delay could possibly be seen if the exchange rate slows sufficiently at a lower temperature. For that reason, the relaxation experiments were repeated at 15 and 5 °C. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3F, the T2 values decrease as expected for all four resonances at the lower temperatures. However, the value of T2 for Trp-671 at both 15 and 5 °C decreases as a function of CPMG delay. This behavior is consistent with chemical exchange at or near Trp-671 rather than with processes occurring on the ns-ps time scale. Although calculation of precise kinetic parameters is difficult from these data (due largely to the relatively rapid relaxation of the 19F nucleus in this protein), the time scale of motion can be estimated by assuming a two-site exchange model between two putative conformers. Using the Equation 1 (“Experimental Procedures”) for two-site exchange, which is valid in all time scales, and assuming equal populations (fits were only marginally sensitive to changing the relative populations), the time constant for the exchange would be ∼0.02 ms at 25 °C, increasing to 0.1 ms at 15 °C and 1.8 ms at 5 °C. To the extent that these assumptions are valid, this would suggest a very high activation energy for exchange (on the order of 40 kcal/mol). In any event, the variable dependence of T2 on CPMG delay is consistent with the presence of chemical exchange on the order of 10s of μs to ms, depending upon the temperature. Given that the line broadening in the glutamate-bound form is very likely because of chemical exchange, the next question would be the origin of the exchange process. One possible candidate is a flip of the peptide backbone described originally by Armstrong and Gouaux (Ref. 7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1, B and C). Relative to the apo form, all crystal forms of AMPA bound S1S2, and four of the five protomers of quisqualate-bound S1S2 show the peptide bond between Asp-651 and Ser-652 flipped by 180°. This conformational change makes it possible to form two additional hydrogen bonds across the interface between the two lobes (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, of the three copies in the asymmetric unit of the glutamate-bound form, one is flipped, one is unflipped, and one is intermediate (Fig. 1B). This suggests that a dynamic equilibrium exists at least in the glutamate-bound form. In a study of the backbone NH dynamics of S1S2 bound to quisqualate, AMPA, and glutamate, Valentine and Palmer (17Valentine E.R. Palmer III, A.G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3410-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found that exchange on the ms time scale occurred near the flip region and that exchange was less evident in the AMPA- and quisqualate-bound forms than in the glutamate-bound form. Given these findings, our initial hypothesis is that the broadening of the Trp-671 line shape is a result of the peptide flip and that the flip occurs on a time scale of 0.02 to 2 ms in the glutamate-bound form. Hydrogen bonding across the interface between the two lobes has been postulated to affect the dissociation rate of the ligand (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 18Robert A. Armstrong N. Gouaux J.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). If this is true, then agents that slow deactivation (a process reflecting channel closure and/or dissociation of the ligand from the active state) may affect the dynamics of the peptide flip, which should in turn affect the line width of the Trp-671 signal in the presence of glutamate. Aniracetam has been shown to slow deactivation (as well as having a small effect on desensitization) in the flop form of GluR2 (19Jin R. Clark S. Weeks A.M. Dudman J.T. Gouaux E. Partin K.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9027-9036Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and has similar effects on GluR1 (20Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the line width of Trp-671 narrows in the presence of 2 mm aniracetam, consistent with a measured increase in the T2 value (Table 1). No changes were observed in any of the other fluorine resonances. These observations are consistent with decreased dynamics near Trp-671 and presumably the peptide flip region. Although aniracetam binds at the dimer interface and can marginally promote the dimerization of the GluR2 S1S2 domain (19Jin R. Clark S. Weeks A.M. Dudman J.T. Gouaux E. Partin K.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9027-9036Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the effect here is presumably on the monomer as the T2 values of the fluorine resonances were not decreased, and gradient diffusion measurements (21Altieri A.S. Hinton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar) indicated no change in the diffusion rate of the protein (data not shown). To explore the dynamics of Trp-671 further, a series of partial agonists was investigated that is expected to differ in the degree and perhaps kinetics of the peptide flip conformational transition. Partial Agonists—Partial agonists are characterized by lower integrated currents at saturating concentrations, suggesting a lower efficacy. Armstrong and Gouaux (7Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) showed that S1S2 bound to the partial agonist, kainate, exhibits a smaller degree of lobe closure than when bound to full agonists. Likewise, the structures of the"

Reduced fertility observed in SULT1E1 knockout (KO) female mice has previously been attributed to the deleterious effect of chronic exposure to high levels of circulating estrogen on placental function. We herein suggest that, in addition to placental dysfunction, this phenotype demonstrates that an excess of estrogen impairs ovulation. The role of SULT1E1 in ovulation is suggested by the substantially low ovulatory response in hCG-treated SULT1E1 KO mice; a similar effect was observed when 17beta-estradiol was administered to wild-type (WT) females. The normal rate of ovulation in SULT1E1 KO females may be restored by PGE2. Along this line, ovaries of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)-treated SULT1E1 KO mice expressed low levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its downstream TSG6; moreover, their ovaries contained a reduced number of expanded cumuli. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that estrogen inactivation may allow the expression of COX-2 and subsequent cumulus expansion, enabling normal ovulation. Our findings may be applied to novel treatments of human ovulatory failure."

Here, we investigated their influence on rat heart ischemia-mediated injury using the Langendorff ex vivo model. EPs, i.e., kappa elastin, at 1.32- and 660-nM concentrations, when administered before the ischemia period, elicited a beneficial influence against ischemia by accelerating the recovery rate of heart contractile parameters and by decreasing significantly creatine kinase release and heart necrosis area when measured at the onset of the reperfusion. All effects were S-Gal-dependent, as being reproduced by (VGVAPG)3 and as being inhibited by receptor antagonists, such as lactose and V14 peptide (VVGSPSAQDEASPL). EPs interaction with S-Gal triggered NO release and activation of PI3-kinase/Akt and ERK1/2 in human coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (RCs). This signaling pathway, as designated as RISK, for reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway, was shown to be responsible for the beneficial influence of EPs on ischemia/reperfusion injury on the basis of its inhibition by specific pharmacological inhibitors. EPs survival activity was attained at a concentration averaging that present into the blood circulation, supporting the contention that these matrikines might offer a natural protection against cardiac injury in young and adult individuals. Such protective effect might be lost with aging, since we found that hearts from 24-month-old rats did not respond to EPs."

We demonstrate that 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF, the predominant folate in plasma) is also a potent, near diffusion limited, scavenger of singlet oxygen and quencher of excited photosensitizers. Both pathways result in decomposition of 5-MTHF, although ascorbate can protect against this loss. In the absence of photosensitizers, 5-MTHF is directly decomposed only very slowly by UVA or UVB. Although synthetic folic acid can promote DNA damage by UVA, submicromolar 5-MTHF inhibits photosensitization-induced strand breaks.

RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are the best understood of the 22 human Rho-family GTPases, which comprise one of five branches of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases (1Wennerberg K. Der C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Like Ras, Rho proteins function as binary switches that alternate between inactive, GDP-bound states and active, GTP-bound states. Once activated, Rho GTPases directly engage numerous downstream effectors to modulate their functions. Active Rho GTPases and their effectors orchestrate actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and gene transcription to coordinate diverse cellular processes including adhesion, migration, phagocytosis, cytokinesis, neurite extension and retraction, polarization, growth, and survival (2Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, aberrant activation of Rho GTPases promotes various developmental, immunological, and proliferative disorders (3Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev.

Dbl-family proteins are characterized by a Dbl-homology (DH) domain, which contacts the Rho GTPase to catalyze nucleotide exchange, and an associated pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which fine-tunes the exchange process by a variety of mechanisms related to the binding of phosphoinositides. The 69 human Dbl-family proteins are divergent in regions outside the DH/PH module, and contain additional domains that presumably dictate unique cellular functions (4Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

However, despite this large spectrum of regulatory mechanisms, in most cases, truncation of Dbl-family proteins often potently activates their exchange activities (9Schmidt A. Hall A.

Currently, there is no general understanding for why truncation promotes unregulated exchange.To better understand potential mechanisms that regulate Dbl-family proteins, we have chosen to study the relatively small, human Dbl-member, Tim (transforming immortalized mammary).

Signal. 2005; 17: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), endogenous Tim is expressed as a 60-kDa protein, consisting of a short N-terminal region (∼70 residues) followed by a DH/PH cassette and an adjacent C-terminal SH3 domain. All conserved homologs of Tim preserve this domain architecture. mRNA transcripts encoding Tim are expressed in numerous tissues and cancer-derived cell lines; corresponding protein expression has been verified in various cell lines (10Chan A.M. McGovern E.S. Catalano G. Fleming T.P. Miki T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1057-1063PubMed Google Scholar, 11Xie X. Chang S.W. Tatsumoto T. Chan A.M. Miki T. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The gene encoding human Tim has been localized to chromosomal region 7q33-7q35, which has been implicated in rearrangements contributing to both acute myelogenous leukemia and breast carcinoma (12Takai S. Chan A.M. Yamada K. Miki T. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1995; 83: 87-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, whereas Tim was originally identified as an oncogene, its in vivo functions and regulation are unknown. Indeed, although Tim was cloned from a cDNA expression library derived from a human mammary epithelial cell line, Tim expression is down-regulated in breast carcinoma cell lines and aggressive primary breast carcinoma cells express versions of Tim in which the catalytic DH domain is either truncated or mutated, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor function for Tim (13Debily M.A. Camarca A. Ciullo M. Mayer C. El Marhomy S. Ba I. Jalil A. Anzisi A. Guardiola J. Piatier-Tonneau D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Here we show that the exchange potential of Tim toward RhoA is inhibited by a short N-terminal region with high helical propensity that directly interacts with the DH domain to prevent access of Rho GTPases to the DH domain. Truncation, mutation, or phosphorylation of this putative helix fully relieves this auto-inhibition. Addition of the putative helix in trans to truncated Tim restores inhibition. Furthermore, a substitution within the DH domain designed to disrupt interactions with the N-terminal helix also relieves auto-inhibition. These results show that Tim, like the distantly related Vav isozymes, is activated by unintentional truncation and regulated phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Full-length and truncated versions of human Tim were PCR-amplified and ligated into pET-21a (Novagen) between NdeI and XhoI. The cDNA for Tim was a gift of Dr. David Siderovski (University of North Carolina).Tim constructs were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen). Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB/ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h at 27 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (buffer A) containing 20 mm NaCl, lysed using an Emulsiflex C5 cell homogenizer (Avestin), and clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Clarified supernatant was loaded on a Fast Flow S column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 20-500 mm NaCl. Tim protein eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl and was loaded onto an S-200 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing monomeric Tim were pooled, concentrated, and stored at -80 °C. Mutations were introduced into wild-type Tim using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and these mutant proteins were expressed and purified as described above. DNA sequences of all expression constructs were verified by automated sequencing. RhoA was purified as described (14Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J.

High Five insect cells were infected with the baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. After 48 h of incubation at 27 °C, cells were harvested by low speed centrifugation, resuspended, and lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol (buffer B) with 10 mm imidazole, and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The clarified supernatants were diluted to a final volume of 150 ml and loaded onto a nickel-charged metal chelating column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole, washed with buffer B containing 50 mm imidazole and eluted with buffer B containing 400 mm imidazole. Eluted Src was extensively dialyzed versus buffer B with 150 mm NaCl and 1mm EGTA, concentrated, and stored at -80 °C.The kinase domain of EphA4 was PCR amplified from the full-length cDNA (gift of N. Mochizuki, National Cardiovascular Center Research Institute, Suita, Osaka, Japan), ligated into pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) in frame with an N-terminal GST tag, and expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli as described above. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (buffer C), lysed, and clarified as described above. Clarified lysate was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). EphA4 protein was washed and eluted in buffer C containing 10 mm glutathione. The GST tag was removed with TEV protease and protein was loaded on an S-200 column equilibrated with buffer C. Eluted EphA4 was concentrated and stored at -80 °C.Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assays—Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP incorporation into RhoA was carried out as described (17Rojas R.J. Kimple R.J. Rossman K.L. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, assay mixtures containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm mant-GTP (Molecular Probes) and 2 μm RhoA were allowed to equilibrate with continuous stirring. After equilibration, 50 nm Tim was added and nucleotide loading was monitored as the decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 295 nm, λem = 335 nm) of RhoA or the increase in the mant-GTP fluorescence (λex = 360 nm, λem = 440 nm) as a function of time using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 spectrophotometer. Rates of guanine nucleotide exchange were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential decay model with GraphPad Prizm. Data were normalized to yield percent GDP released and assays were performed in duplicate.Cell Culture and Transformation Assays—NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% calf serum (Hyclone). HEK 293T cells and SYF fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). PCR-amplified Tim constructs were ligated into pcDNA 3.1 Hygro (Invitrogen) between EcoRI and XhoI such that an expressed HA-tag was encoded at the N terminus of each construct. Mutations were introduced into wild-type Tim as described above.Cell lines stably expressing Tim were established by transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with 1 μg of each pcDNA construct using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three days post-transfection the cells were subcultured into growth medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml of hygromycin B. Mass populations of multiple, drug-resistant colonies (>50) were pooled together for focus formation analyses. Western blot analysis with an anti-HA antibody (Covance) was performed to verify Tim expression in the cell lines.For the secondary focus formation assays, equal numbers of cells from each cell line were seeded into 60-mm dishes. The growth medium of each dish was replaced with fresh hygromycin-supplemented medium every 3 days. 14 days after seeding, the dishes were stained with crystal violet and the foci were quantified by visual inspection. Individual experiments were performed in duplicate and independently carried out three times.GTPase Activation Assays—Affinity purifications of RhoA were carried out as described (18Solski P.A.

In brief, the Rho binding domain of Rhotekin (amino acids 7-89) was expressed as a GST fusion protein in BL21(DE3) cells and immobilized on glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of various pcDNA-Tim constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immediately posttransfection, these cells were serum starved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 16 h. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered serum and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Total protein concentration of the lysates was determined by a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). 1 mg of clarified HEK 293T lysate was incubated with 120 μg of GST-Rhotekin-Rho binding domain beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl and protease inhibitors). Total and affinity purified lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using an anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibody. Each experiment was performed a minimum of three times. Precipitation of Tim with recombinant G17A RhoA was performed essentially as described (19Arthur W.T. Ellerbroek S.M. Der C.J. Burridge K. Wennerberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42964-42972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).In Vitro Kinase Assay—30 μg of purified Tim protein was incubated with 250 ng of recombinant Src or EphA4 kinase domain in kinase buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 125 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 100 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 60 min at 30 °C. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Control substrate peptide was obtained from Upstate.Immunoprecipitation—The cDNAs for various Src constructs in pUSEamp were obtained from Upstate. SYF fibroblasts were transfected with 10 μg of Src and 5 μg of Tim using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were serum starved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum and incubated for 16 h. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered serum and lysed in lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. 1 mg of clarified SYF lysate was incubated with 25 μg of anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in lysis buffer. Total and affinity purified lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Src (Upstate), anti-HA (Covance), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) antibodies. The experiment was performed three times.RESULTSSpecificity of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Activity of Tim—Previous studies by our laboratory have shown that Tim catalyzes exchange of guanine nucleotides on RhoA, but not on Rac1 or Cdc42 (16Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This specificity of exchange activity is due to the fact that Tim possesses a basic residue in helix α5 of the DH domain, which is able to form an energetically favorable salt-bridge interaction with glutamate 54 of RhoA. Rac1 and Cdc42 does not have an acidic residue in the position analogous to Glu-54 of RhoA, and thus cannot make this contact with Tim (16Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, recent work in which Tim is overexpressed in various mammalian cell types suggests that Tim may catalyze exchange on more than one Rho family GTPase. For example, expression of Tim in COS-7 or NIH 3T3 cells leads to a loss of actin stress fibers and the formation of membrane ruffles, dorsal ruffles, and filopodia, suggesting that Tim may activate Rac1, RhoG, or Cdc42 but not RhoA in these cell types (13Debily M.A. Camarca A. Ciullo M. Mayer C. El Marhomy S. Ba I. Jalil A. Anzisi A. Guardiola J. Piatier-Tonneau D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, expression of Tim in COS-7 cells leads to activation of RhoA, and not Rac1 or Cdc42, in pulldown experiments using GST-tagged versions of the Rho-binding domains of the Rho effector, Rhotekin, and the Rac1 and Cdc42 effector, Pak (11Xie X. Chang S.W. Tatsumoto T. Chan A.M. Miki T. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the same study, Tim expression in NIH 3T3 cells led to activation of JNK, SRF, and AP-1-regulated transcription, suggesting that Tim activates multiple GTPases in this cell type. However, in the same work, Tim expression in Swiss 3T3 cells led to cell rounding, whereas Tim expression in HeLa cells led to an increase in vinculin-enriched focal adhesions, suggesting that Tim activates RhoA in these cell types.In an attempt to resolve these conflicting data, and to test the hypothesis that Tim activates multiple GTPases, we performed a fluorescence-based guanine nucleotide exchange assay on a library of Rho-family GTPases (Fig. 1). In this assay, Tim robustly activated each of the members of the RhoA subfamily of Rho GTPases, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. However, Tim failed to activate members of the Rac1 (Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, and RhoG) or Cdc42 (Cdc42, TCL, and TC10) subfamilies. These data suggest that Tim directly activates members of the RhoA subfamily of GTPases, but may indirectly activate additional GTPases when overexpressed in various cell types.Regulation of Tim by Regions Preceding Its DH Domain—Tim was originally identified by its capacity to transform NIH 3T3 cells upon N-terminal truncation (10Chan A.M. McGovern E.S. Catalano G. Fleming T.P. Miki T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1057-1063PubMed Google Scholar). Because many Dbl-family proteins are activated by similar truncations, we undertook a detailed analysis of the structural determinants within the N-terminal region of Tim required for its auto-inhibition. Using purified proteins, full-length Tim (wt, Fig. 2A) enhanced the rate of exchange of guanine nucleotide bound to RhoA by a modest 5-fold relative to the equivalent, spontaneous reaction (-). In contrast, truncation of the first 22 residues of Tim (Δ22) greatly enhanced the normalized loading of nucleotide by more than 30-fold.FIGURE 2Full-length Tim is auto-inhibited by its N-terminal region. A, the exchange of GDP bound to RhoA and catalyzed by Tim was measured using a standard fluorescence-based assay (14Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Rojas R.J. Kimple R.J. Rossman K.L. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). -Fold activation is relative to the spontaneous loading of guanine nucleotide and represents the average of two independent reactions for each trace. Equal amounts (2 μg) of purified proteins used in the exchange assays are shown at the right following SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Also shown is a schematic of the domain architecture of Tim with the site of N-terminal truncation indicated. B, N-terminal truncated Tim potentiates transformation of NIH 3T3 cells.

The combined results from the in vitro exchange assays and cellular transformation assays indicate that Tim is auto-inhibited by its N terminus and that deletion of the first 22 residues of Tim relieves this auto-inhibition to promote robust guanine nucleotide exchange on RhoA in vitro as well as significant transformation of NIH 3T3 cells.To produce a high-resolution map of the residues within the N-terminal portion of Tim necessary for auto-inhibition, this region was subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis and the resulting purified mutant proteins were tested for their capacity to activate RhoA in vitro (Fig. 3A). This analysis identified residues 15-22 of Tim as necessary for its auto-inhibition in vitro. Stable expression of these substituted forms of Tim in NIH 3T3 cells indicated an approximate direct correlation between the capacity of Tim to activate RhoA in vitro and the transformation potential of the mutated forms of Tim (Fig. 3B). One exception to this rule, Y22A, significantly relieved the auto-inhibition of Tim in vitro, but failed to activate the transforming potential of Tim. It was reasoned that in the cellular environment secondary intermolecular interactions might serve to stabilize the auto-inhibited state. These secondary stabilizing interactions would be lacking in the in vitro exchange assays using purified components such that even modest perturbation to the auto-inhibition of Tim (e.g. Y22A) would appear relatively enhanced. To explore this possibility, Tyr-22 was subsequently mutated to Glu (Y22E) with the anticipation that the added negative charge would further perturb auto-inhibitory interactions. The identical substitution was separately created at Tyr-19, and the resulting mutant proteins were analyzed as above. Both potentially phosphomimetic substitutions led to robust in vitro activation of RhoA and correspondingly large increases in the transformation potential of Tim. To the best of our knowledge, these data represent the first report of a full-length Dbl-family protein that is activated by single substitutions to the same extent as activation by N-terminal truncation.FIGURE 3A short region within Tim is responsible for auto-inhibition. A, the N-terminal portion of Tim was subjected to scanning mutagenesis and the purified proteins were assayed for their capacity to catalyze the exchange of guanine nucleotides on RhoA. -Fold activation is relative to the spontaneous loading of nucleotide onto RhoA (-) and represents the average of two independent assays for each mutant. Equal amounts (2 μg) of purified proteins used in the exchange assays are shown in the lower panel following SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (a composite of several gels is shown). B, equivalent forms of Tim were stably expressed in NIH 3T3 cells (lower panel, composite Western blot) and assayed for foci formation (upper panel).

The exchange activity of Tim (Δ22) alone was greatly enhanced with respect to full-length Tim, as was also shown in Fig. 1A. However, the exchange activity of Tim (Δ22) in the presence of the wild-type peptide was reduced to that of full-length, auto-inhibited Tim. To determine whether the observed inhibition was specific for this peptide, we also created a peptide in which the tyrosine residue corresponding to Tyr-19 in full-length Tim was converted to glutamic acid (MT, Fig. 4A). Substitution of Tyr-19 with glutamic acid in the context of full-length Tim led to Tim activation in both the in vitro exchange assay and the cellular transformation assay (Fig. 3). We therefore expected that a peptide incorporating this substitution would have no effect on the exchange potential of Tim (Δ22). This hypothesis was borne out experimentally, because the exchange potential of Tim (Δ22) in the presence of the mutant peptide was identical to that of Tim (Δ22) alone. Importantly, neither peptide had an effect on the intrinsic rate of exchange on RhoA. These data strongly suggest that residues 15-22 are both necessary and sufficient for Tim auto-inhibition.FIGURE 4The N-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for Tim auto-inhibition. A, Tim (Δ22) was incubated with either a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal auto-inhibitory region (WT, biotin-SQLLYQEYSDV-amide) or a mutant peptide (MT, biotin-SQLLEQEYSDV-amide) at room temperature for 20 min. The resulting complexes were assayed for their ability to stimulate loading of mant-GTP onto RhoA. The peptide concentrations were 100 μm. B, the activity of Tim constructs transiently expressed in quiescent HEK 293T cells was assessed by a pulldown assay using GST-tagged nucleotide-free RhoA as the affinity purification matrix. Levels of active Tim were determined by immunoblotting the pulldown samples. Immunoblots (IB) of the total cell lysate (2.5% input shown) show approximately equal expression of the Tim constructs. C, the ability of Tim constructs to stimulate GTP loading on RhoA in HEK 293T cells was ass"

Abnormal tumor vasculature impairs oxygen and drug delivery and results in radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance, respectively. Alpha particles are extraordinarily potent, short-ranged radiations with geometry uniquely suitable for selectively killing neovasculature.Actinium-225 ((225)Ac)-E4G10, an alpha-emitting antibody construct reactive with the unengaged form of vascular endothelial cadherin, is capable of potent, selective killing of tumor neovascular endothelium and late endothelial progenitors in bone-marrow and blood. No specific normal-tissue uptake of E4G10 was seen by imaging or post-mortem biodistribution studies in mice. In a mouse-model of prostatic carcinoma, (225)Ac-E4G10 treatment resulted in inhibition of tumor growth, lower serum prostate specific antigen level and markedly prolonged survival, which was further enhanced by subsequent administration of paclitaxel. Immunohistochemistry revealed lower vessel density and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis in (225)Ac-E4G10 treated tumors. Additionally, the residual tumor vasculature appeared normalized as evident by enhanced pericyte coverage following (225)Ac-E4G10 therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2082818407,"The insulin receptor is a homodimer composed of two αβ half receptors. Scanning mutagenesis studies have identified key residues important for insulin binding in the L1 domain (amino acids 1-150) and C-terminal region (amino acids 704-719) of the α subunit. However, it has not been shown whether insulin interacts with these two sites within the same α chain or whether it cross-links a site from each α subunit in the dimer to achieve high affinity binding. Here we have tested the contralateral binding mechanism by analyzing truncated insulin receptor dimers (midi-hIRs) that contain complementary mutations in each α subunit. Midi-hIRs containing Ala14, Ala64, or Gly714 mutations were fused with Myc or FLAG epitopes at the C terminus and were expressed separately by transient transfection. Immunoblots showed that R14A+FLAG, F64A+FLAG, and F714G+Myc mutant midi-hIRs were expressed in the medium but insulin binding activity was not detected. However, after co-transfection with R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc or F64A+FLAG/F714G+Myc, hybrid dimers were obtained with a marked increase in insulin binding activity. Competitive displacement assays revealed that the hybrid mutant receptors bound insulin with the same affinity as wild type and also displayed curvilinear Scatchard plots. In addition, when hybrid mutant midi-hIR was covalently cross-linked with 125I(A14)-insulin and reduced, radiolabeled monomer was immunoprecipitated only with anti-FLAG, demonstrating that insulin was bound asymmetrically.

Taken together, these results suggest that insulin interacts simultaneously with these two regions on the α subunit to achieve high affinity binding. However, it has not been determined whether insulin binds to these regions derived from the same α chain (cis binding mechanism) or from adjacent α subunits in the IR dimer (contralateral binding). To address this issue, we have expressed truncated IR dimers (midi-hIR) with inactivating mutations at Arg14, Phe64, and Phe714. When expressed as homodimers, the mutant midi-hIRs did not bind insulin, but hybrid mutant midi-hIR formed by co-transfection of two midi-hIR containing complementary mutations exhibited high affinity insulin binding indistinguishable from wild type. Materials—Oligonucleotide primers were prepared using an Applied Biosystems DNA Synthesizer. PCR amplification and ligation of DNA fragments, preparation of plasmid DNA, and DNA sequence analyses were performed using standard techniques. Cultured 293H cells were purchased from Invitrogen. 125I(A14)-insulin was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All chemicals were molecular biology or reagent grade. Construction and Expression of midi-hIR—The midi-hIR cDNA corresponds to mIR.Fn0/Ex10 as described by Brandt et al. (6Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and was constructed by PCR amplification and ligation of DNA fragments using a cloned hIR cDNA available in our laboratory as the template. The resultant WT+FLAG and WT+Myc cDNAs encoded hIR signal peptide and residues 1-601 fused to residues 650-719 together with an epitope tag sequence FLAG (DYKDDDK) or Myc (EQKLISEEDL) at the C terminus and were inserted into mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing confirmed the plasmids contained the canonical hIR sequence (9Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tzubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rozen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar) except for coding mutations H144Y and K224R due to allelic variations present in our cloned hIR cDNA (sequences available upon request). Mutant receptors R14A+FLAG (CGG mutated to GCG at residue 14), F64A +FLAG (TTC mutated to GCC at residue 64), and F714G+Myc (TTC mutated to GGC at residue 714) were generated by in vitro mutagenesis of the WT midi-hIR plasmid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The entire cDNA insert in each mutant midi-hIR was verified by DNA sequencing. The midi-hIR constructs were transiently expressed by transfection into 293H cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Medium was collected 72 and 144 h post-transfection, concentrated 7-fold by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra 15; Millipore), adjusted to 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.02% NaN3, and stored at 4 °C until used. Insulin Binding Assay—Binding of 125I(A14)-insulin by the midi receptors was assayed by the polyethylene glycol precipitation method (10Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1980-1991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing midi-hIR were incubated in 200 μl of binding buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.025% (w/v) Triton X-100) containing 30,000 cpm (∼10 pm) 125I(A14)-insulin overnight at 4 °C. 500 μl of 0.2% γ-globulin and 500 μl of 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol Mr 8000 were added to co-precipitate the insulin-receptor complex, the sample was microfuged for 10 min, the supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the pellet was counted in a γ counter. Specific binding was determined by subtracting background radioactivity obtained with only binding buffer. For competitive displacement assays, unlabeled human insulin was added to the samples in the concentrations indicated. Chemical Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was used to covalently cross-link 125I(A14)-insulin to the midi-hIR. After an overnight incubation in binding buffer at 4 °C, samples containing the insulinreceptor complex were treated with 10 mm DSS (freshly dissolved in Me2SO) added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm and held on ice for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to 20 mm, and an aliquot was mixed with 4× loading buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. For immunoprecipitation, the cross-linked 125I(A14)-insulin-receptor complex was diluted in binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 3 μg of anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibody. After 2 h of incubation, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was added, and the mixture was rocked on a mixing platform for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then pelleted by centrifugation in a microfuge for 2 min, rinsed with ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, resuspended in 1× Laemmli loading buffer (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples were dissolved in Laemmli loading buffer in the presence (reducing) or absence (non-reducing) of 2% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and electrophoresed on 6% acrylamide slab gels. For autoradiography, gels were fixed for 20 min in 10% acetic acid/25% isopropanol (v/v), dried onto Whatman 3MM paper, and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Biomax MS) or a phosphor screen (Packard Cyclone) for autoradiography. For immunoblotting, proteins in gels were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon P; Millipore). The membrane was blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (10 mm NaHPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4) and probed with rabbit anti-human IRα N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes residues 1-20 in the IR α subunit, mouse monoclonal antibody anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), or rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc (Santa Cruz). The membrane was washed two times with PBST, reacted with secondary antibodies anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The expressed midi-hIR sequence corresponded to the mIR. Fno/Ex10 construct as described by Brandt et al. (6Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and contained the hIR signal peptide plus aa 1-601 fused to aa 650-719 of the α subunit. In addition, a Myc (EQKLISEEDL) or FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope tag sequence was fused to the C terminus to uniquely label each receptor. After transfection with WT+FLAG or WT+Myc into 293H cells, immunoblot analysis showed that a predominately 260-kDa truncated IR dimer was secreted into the medium, which was reduced by mercaptoethanol to the 130-kDa monomeric form. The medium also contained high affinity insulin binding activity with a calculated IC50 = 0.27 nm (see Fig. 5), consistent with results presented by Brandt et al. (6Brandt J. Andersen A.S. Kristensen C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12378-12384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mutant midi-hIRs R14A+FLAG, F64A+FLAG, and F714G+Myc were prepared by in vitro mutagenesis and analyzed for expression after transient transfection. Immunoblots revealed that each mutant receptor was expressed as a 260-kDa dimer in similar amounts to WT, but no insulin binding was detected (Fig. 1). These results show that alanine mutations at Arg14, Phe64, and glycine mutation at Phe714 that markedly reduced insulin binding in the holo-IR (7Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Whittaker J. Whittaker L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20932-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also inactivated insulin binding in the midi-hIR. However, when 293H cells were co-transfected with two complementary constructs, R14A+FLAG and F714G+Myc or F64A+FLAG and F714G+Myc, insulin binding activity was recovered in the medium. A control co-transfection performed with two non-complementary mutants, R14A+FLAG and F64A+FLAG, yielded no detectable insulin binding activity, and this provided evidence that the midi-hIRs must contain complementary mutations (Fig. 1). However, we always obtained 2-6-fold less insulin binding activity than would be expected from the amount of hybrid receptor formed by random dimerization of each mutant α subunit. The explanation for this discrepancy is not known, but one possibility is that mutant receptors may preferentially form homodimers due to subtle conformational changes introduced by the presence of different epitope tags at the C terminus or to the presence of the mutated residues. Thus, the amount of hybrid receptor present in the medium after co-transfection with two mutant midi-hIR may be less than expected based on the immunoblot result. To demonstrate that the recovery of insulin binding activity was due to the formation of hybrid mutant receptors, several experiments were performed to characterize these receptors. First, when media from single mutant transfections were combined, no insulin binding activity was recovered, indicating that co-expression of the complementary mutant receptors in the same cell was necessary as would be the case in order to form the class I (α-α) disulfide bonds present in a hybrid dimer (data not shown). In addition, it has been shown that the hIR holo-receptor can be converted to αβ half receptors by reduction of the class I disulfide bonds with low concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT) and the half receptor retains insulin binding activity (12Boni-Schnetzler M. Rubin J.B. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15281-15287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Boni-Schnetzler M. Scott W. Waugh S.M. DiBella E. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8395-8401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, incubation of WT midi-hIR dimer with 2 mm DTT efficiently produced the monomeric α chain that bound and chemically cross-linked 125I(A14)-insulin. However, all binding activity was lost when medium from complementary mutants was similarly treated (Fig. 2). We also analyzed the hybrid mutant midi-hIR by performing successive immunoprecipitations with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc. In this experiment, 125I(A14)-insulin was covalently cross-linked to R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc with DSS and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG. The immunoprecipitated receptor was dissolved in 1% SDS, and an aliquot was re-immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc. Analysis of the samples by SDS-PAGE revealed that substantially all of the insulin-labeled receptors were immunoreactive with both antibodies, and this provides strong evidence that the active receptor is a covalent hybrid dimer (Fig. 3). However, if the 125I(A14)-insulin-labeled R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc receptor was first reduced to monomeric form by incubation with 2 mm DTT and subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc, only the R14A+FLAG α subunit was detected (Fig. 4). This result demonstrates that DSS cross-links 125I(A14)-insulin specifically to the R14A+FLAG α subunit and therefore insulin was bound asymmetrically to the hybrid receptor. We have recently performed the same analysis with a hybrid midi-hIR in which the epitope tags were reversed, i.e. R14A+Myc/F714G+FLAG, and in this case the cross-linked insulin was immunoprecipitated only with anti-Myc (data not shown). This result demonstrates that insulin cross-linking was not dependent on the epitope tag sequence.FIGURE 4Immunoprecipitation of 125I(A14)-insulin-labeled R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc after reduction with 2 mm DTT. Media from 293H cells cotransfected with R14A+FLAG and F714G+Myc were incubated with 125I(A14)-insulin and cross-linked with DSS as described in Fig. 3. After partial reduction with 2 mm DTT, aliquots were analyzed directly (-) or were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc, separated on a 6% SDS/PAGE, and autoradiographed. Molecular masses (kDa) of protein markers are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Competitive displacement assays were performed to compare the binding affinity of the hybrid mutant receptors with that of WT. Fig. 5 shows representative competitive assays performed with WT, R14+FLAG/F714A+Myc, and F64A+FLAG/F714G+Myc. There were no significant differences in the calculated values for affinity binding constants with WT = 0.27 nm ± 0.38, R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc = 0.13 nm ± 0.09, and F64A+FLAG/F714G+Myc = 0.38 nm ± 0.37. In addition, Fig. 5 shows that curvilinear Scatchard plots were also obtained for both WT and hybrid receptors. These results demonstrate that the hybrid mutant receptors bound insulin with complex kinetic properties similar to WT midi-hIR. Utilizing alanine-scanning mutagenesis, Whittaker et al. (7Whittaker J. Sorensen H. Gadboll V.L. Hinrichsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47380-47384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Whittaker J. Whittaker L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20932-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have reported that mutations at Arg14, Phe64, and Phe714 in the holo-IR resulted in a marked loss of insulin binding activity. Here we have shown that secreted truncated IR dimer constructs (midi-hIRs) with an alanine or glycine mutation at Arg14, Phe64, or Phe714 were efficiently expressed and correctly folded but also exhibited no detectable insulin binding activity. However, by co-expressing two midi-hIRs with complementary mutations, R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc or F64A+FLAG/F714G+Myc, a hybrid receptor was obtained that bound insulin with high affinity similar to wild type midi-hIR and yielded a curvilinear Scatchard plot. Several control experiments were performed to ensure that the insulin binding activity was attributable to the formation of a hybrid receptor. Thus, we showed that treatment with 2 mm DTT reduced the α-α disulfide bond in the dimer to yield inactive midi-hIR monomer. Similarly, insulin binding activity was not recovered when two preformed mutant midi-hIRs were incubated in vitro, and the co-expression of two noncomplementary mutants, i.e. R14A+FLAG and F64A+FLAG, did not yield active hybrid receptor. We have also shown that 125I(A14)-insulin is bound asymmetrically to the hybrid midi-hIRs containing R14A+FLAG/F714G+Myc or F64A+FLAG/F714G+Myc. After cross-linking with DSS and reduction, the labeled A-chain was selectively immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG. Because DSS can crosslink with the primary amine at GlyA1, this implies that the insulin N-terminal A-chain binds to the C-terminal region of the α-subunit. This result is consistent with the recent finding reported by Wan et al. (14Wan Z. Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.-Q. Wang S. Chu Y.-C. Katsoyannis P. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5000-5016Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), who used photo-affinity-labeled insulin analogue to identify that ValA3 interacts with the C-terminal region of the IR α chain. The recovery of high affinity insulin binding activity in the hybrid mutant midi-hIR suggests that insulin can bind contralaterally to the two α subunits in the holo-IR and this property may be important for IR signaling. It is now clear that the signaling mechanisms for a number of hormones, including growth hormone and the epidermal growth factors, involve ligand-mediated receptor dimerization (15de Vos A.M.

In the case of insulin, the conundrum has been that the IR already exists as a covalently linked dimer. Nonetheless, several models have been proposed in which a single insulin molecule is shown to bind both α subunits, and this binding induces a conformational change in the IR to activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase (18Shaffer L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19De Meyts P. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S135-S148Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20Ottensmeyer F.P.

Our results suggest that by constructing a hybrid holo-IR with a complementary mutation in each α subunit using sequences analogous to those described here, the validity of a cross-linking mechanism can be tested by characterizing hybrid holo-IR insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activities."

To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms utilized by PCI we developed a robust expression system in Escherichia coli and solved the crystal structure of PCI in its native state. The five monomers obtained from our two crystal forms provide an NMR-like ensemble revealing regions of inherent flexibility. The reactive center loop (RCL) of PCI is long and highly flexible with no evidence of hinge region incorporation into β-sheet A, as seen for other heparin-binding serpins. We adapted an extrinsic fluorescence method for determining dissociation constants for heparin and find that the N-terminal tail of PCI and residues adjacent to helix H are not involved in heparin binding. The minimal heparin length capable of tight binding to PCI was determined to be chains of eight monosaccharide units. A large hydrophobic pocket occupied by hydrophobic crystal contacts was found in an analogous position to the hormone-binding site in thyroxine-binding globulin. In conclusion, the data presented here provide important insights into the mechanisms by which PCI exercises its multiple inhibitory and non-inhibitory functions.

It is a glycoprotein of 387 residues produced by several cell types and found in many tissues. In humans, PCI is produced in the liver and secreted into the blood where it circulates at ∼100 nm (1Geiger M. Zechmeister-Machhart M. Uhrin P. Hufnagl P. Ecke S. Priglinger U. Xu J. Zheng X.

PCI is named after its ability to inhibit the proteases which comprise the protein C anticoagulant pathway, activated protein C (APC) (4Marlar R.A. Griffin J.H. J. Clin.

Immunopharmacology. 1997; 36: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, identifying the true targets of PCI is made difficult by its inhibitory promiscuity. PCI utilizes the conserved serpin mechanism (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), where specificity is determined by kinetics of formation of the Michaelis complex (10Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11742-11756Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After which, the protease proceeds with attack of the scissile bond (P1-P1′, nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (12Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4783) Google Scholar)), and at the acyl-enzyme intermediate stage the serpin undergoes a rapid conformational change which distorts the structure of the protease to prohibit deacylation (9Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 14Dementiev A. Dobo J. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3452-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This mechanism lends itself to promiscuous inhibition of proteases, and has been found to support the inhibition of subtilisin-type serine proteases (15Komiyama T. Gron H. Pemberton P.A. Salvesen G.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and some cysteine proteases (16Komiyama T. Ray C.A. Pickup D.J. Howard A.D. Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P.

Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Normally serpins have a single reactive center residue (P1) which significantly determines inhibitory specificity. An arginine in the P1 position of PCI makes it an inhibitor of trypsin-like proteases including uPA, tPA, thrombin, factors IXa, Xa, and XIa, plasmin, kallikrein, etc.; however PCI is also capable of inhibiting chymotrypsin-like proteases, presumably through the Phe at the P2 position (18Pratt C.W. Church F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8789-8794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, exosites (residues which do not belong to the RCL) can also critically influence specificity (11Huntington J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 450-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The general nature of the serpin mechanism combined with dual reactive centers renders PCI especially promiscuous, thus expanding the breadth of possible biological functions. PCI belongs to a subclass of serpins known as the heparinbinding serpins, which includes antithrombin (AT), heparin cofactor II (HCII), protease nexin 1, and PAI-1 (for recent review see Ref. 19Garg H.G.

Elsevier, Oxford2005: 367-398Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but once again PCI stands out from the crowd. Whereas all other members utilize basic residues along the face of helix D for heparin binding, PCI is thought to utilize helix H and a basic N-terminal extension (20Kuhn L.A. Griffin J.H.

Biophys. 1998; 355: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the importance of the N-terminal region (5HRHHPREMKKR15) remains unresolved. It is, however, important to note that affinity of PCI for GAGs has never been measured directly, and that all inferences drawn concerning the importance of basic regions, GAG selectivity, or response to conformational change are drawn from elution from heparin-Sepharose or the effect on GAG acceleration of protease inhibition. Another feature, which is commonly observed for heparin-binding serpins, is a heparin-induced conformational change (23Huntington J.A. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of native AT (24Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and HCII (25Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) revealed the incorporation of the N terminus of the RCL (the hinge region) into β-sheet A. Heparin activation is effected, in part, by liberating the RCL from its contacts with the body of the serpin (26Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 27O'Keeffe D. Olson S.T. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Baglin T.P. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50267-50273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although PCI does not utilize helix D for heparin binding, a heparin-induced conformational change in PCI is possible, although it would presumably depend on the native structure of PCI resembling that of AT and HCII (i.e. hinge region inserted). As for the other heparin-binding serpins, heparin acceleration of protease inhibition by PCI involves heparin binding to both the protease and PCI, thus implying a bridging mechanism (28Shen L. Villoutreix B.O. Dahlback B. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to other heparin-binding serpins, heparin binding to PCI can also decrease the rate of protease inhibition, as seen with tissue kallikrein (29Ecke S. Geiger M. Resch I. Jerabek I. Sting L. Maier M. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7048-7052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, heparin-like GAGs can alter PCI specificity by either promoting or preventing protease inhibition, a unique feature that may play a key role in determining the tissue-specific activities of PCI. The serpin architecture has also evolved to carry out some non-inhibitory functions such as hormone transport (30Hammond G.L. Smith C.L. Goping I.S. Underhill D.A. Harley M.J. Reventos J. Musto N.A. Gunsalus G.L. Bardin C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5153-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) bind tightly to hydrophobic hormones and are thought to exploit the serpin conformational change for delivery to specific sites (e.g. sites of inflammation) (31Pemberton P.A. Stein P.E. Pepys M.B. Potter J.M. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1988; 336: 257-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 32Suda S.A. Gettins P.G. Patston P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PCI is also capable of interacting with hydrophobic molecules such as estradiol, testosterone, and retinoic acid (33Jerabek I. Zechmeister-Machhart M. Binder B.R. Geiger M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and although the functional relevance of this ability remains unclear, the mechanism of binding may be related to that utilized by CBG and TBG. Our structure of RCL-cleaved PCI revealed an unexpected shift in the position of helix H and a two-turn shortening of helix A, which created a large hydrophobic pocket, termed the helix A gap (34Huntington J.A. Kjellberg M. Stenflo J. Structure. 2003; 11: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The helix A gap was proposed to be the binding site for hydrophobic compounds, but it was not clear if this feature is preserved in native PCI. Unlike many members of the serpin family, PCI has not been studied extensively at the biochemical and structural level, due in part, to the difficulty in obtaining large amounts of pure native protein. We have established an efficient method for the production of milligram quantities of wild-type and N-terminal truncated PCI from E. coli, which has allowed us to obtain diffraction quality crystals of native PCI under different conditions. Here we describe five native PCI structures obtained from two separate crystallization conditions, providing an NMR-like ensemble of structures. The ensemble reveals the flexible regions in native PCI including the RCL, helix F, helix D, the loop between helices C and D, and the N terminus. The RCL is highly flexible with no evidence of hinge region incorporation into β-sheet A, as seen in other heparin-binding serpins. However, in one of the five structures of PCI we observed a small opening at the top of the sheet which suggested a mechanism for the initial insertion event shared by other members of the serpin family. To determine the extent of the heparin-binding site of PCI we developed an extrinsic fluorescence method for determining dissociation constants for heparin. We find that the N-terminal tail of PCI and residues adjacent to helix H do not contribute significantly to heparin binding affinity, as previously proposed. In addition, we determined the effect of heparin length on affinity and discovered that an eight monosaccharide chain is the shortest which can fully occupy the heparin-binding site on PCI. The helix A gap was observed in native PCI and hydrophobic crystal contacts were found in this region. In conclusion, the data presented here provide important insights into the mechanisms by which PCI exercises its multiple inhibitory and non-inhibitory functions. Materials—pET19b and the Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strain were purchased from Novagen. Heparin with an average molecular weight of 15 kDa was obtained from Rovi Pharmaceutical Laboratories (Madrid, Spain). Human thrombin and APC were purchased from Hematologic Technologies. Crystallization reagents were purchased from Hampton Research, and chromogenic substrates S2238 and S2366 were purchased from Chromogenix. 2-(p-Toluidinyl)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (TNS) was purchased from Molecular Probes, and was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide. Depolymerized heparins of lengths varying from 6 to 16 monosaccharide units were purchased from Iduron. RCL-cleaved (Ala356-Arg357) plasma and recombinant PCI was produced essentially as described previously (34Huntington J.A. Kjellberg M. Stenflo J. Structure. 2003; 11: 205-215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to cleavage in the RCL, N-terminal sequencing showed a cleavage site at either residue 19 or 20 on the N terminus (data not shown), effectively removing the A+ helix. Cloning and Mutagenesis of Recombinant PCI—The human PCI gene, starting from His1 (without signal peptide), or Val17 (Δ16), was cloned into pET19b between NdeI and BamHI sites. This vector generated a fusion protein with a 10His tag at the N terminus of PCI followed by an enterokinase cleavage site. After purifying the protein, we found that PCI inhibits enterokinase to form an SDS-stable complex. We therefore left the tag in place for crystallization and biochemical characterizations. The R229A mutation was generated according to the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis protocol on the Δ16 background. Correct sequences for all clones were verified by DNA sequencing at Gene Service or Lark Technologies. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PCI—PCIpET19b vectors were transformed into Rosetta DE3 pLysS strain for protein expression. Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase followed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction at 30 °C overnight. Purification was achieved with a Ni-NTA column (Amersham Biosciences), heparin-Sepharose, and S-75 gel filtration. We typically ran a final heparin Sepharose column after gel filtration in order to concentrate the protein, and to remove cleaved PCI, which eluted slightly later than native PCI. Typical yields of pure native PCI (wild-type and variants) were 2-3 mg per liter of culture. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement for C2 Crystal Form—Initial screens using both full-length and Δ16 PCI generated many leads. Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained for Δ16 PCI (2.6 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 550 mm NaCl) after seeding into drops containing 66.7 mm tripotassium citrate, 6.7% PEG3350, at room temperature. The crystal was cryoprotected in 12% PEG3350, 20% glycerol (increased in 5% steps), and 120 mm potassium citrate, and flash-cooled in vapor nitrogen to 100 K. Data were collected at Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (Warrington, Cheshire, UK) station 14.1 from a single crystal, and processed using Mosflm, Scala, and Truncate (35Leslie A.W.G. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography.Vol. 26. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program Phaser (36McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) with 1QLP (N terminus and RCL removed) as the initial search model. After rigid body refinement with five fragments per monomer, strict NCS was used for several rounds of refinement. Restrained NCS was used in subsequent rounds and later removed entirely. Refinement was conducted using the programs CNS (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement for P21 Crystal Form—Diffraction quality crystals of Δ16 PCI (2 mg/ml in 50% glycerol) were obtained from drops containing 6% PEG3350, 40 mm ammonium citrate, and 10% glycerol. Crystals were cryoprotected in 10% PEG3350, 20% glycerol, 40 mm ammonium citrate, and flash-cooled to 100 K. Data were collected at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) station 14-3 from a single crystal and processed as above. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the refined model from the first crystal form, and refined with CNS. Data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Although quality data were obtained to 1.9-Å resolution, completeness was low because of the position of the detector. We therefore truncated the data to 2 Å, although fully complete data were only obtained to 2.2-Å resolution. Figures were created using Pymol, Spock, and Raster3D (40Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P.

Briefly, PCI and its variants were loaded ontoa 1 m l of HiTrap heparin Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. The bound protein was then eluted with a 10-column volume gradient from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl, and the conductivity of the peak was measured by the FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Accurate dissociation constants were obtained using TNS as an extrinsic fluorescence probe, essentially as described previously for HCII (27O'Keeffe D. Olson S.T. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Baglin T.P. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50267-50273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, precisely size-fractionated heparin (41Goger B. Halden Y. Rek A. Mosl R. Pye D. Gallagher J. Kungl A.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1640-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was added to buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG8000, and 1 mm EDTA) containing PCI (200-400 nm) and TNS (10 μm). The change in fluorescence was monitored on a PerkinElmer LS 50B fluorometer with excitation wavelength of 330 nm. Typically, heparin binding resulted in a 6-10% fluorescence quench at the maximum emission wavelength (∼448 nm). When the background TNS fluorescence was subtracted, we observed a 39% quench with a 2-3 nm blue-shift, consistent with previous studies (supplemental Fig. S1) (27O'Keeffe D. Olson S.T. Gasiunas N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2698-2704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cleaved PCI had a significantly lower starting fluorescence and a smaller fluorescence change upon titration with heparin (2%). Dissociation constants were determined from the titration data through non-linear regression, as described previously (27O'Keeffe D. Olson S.T. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Baglin T.P. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50267-50273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The dependence of binding affinity on heparin length was determined as previously (22Neese L.L. Wolfe C.A. Church F.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using Equation 1, KA,app.=KA,int.×(N-L+1)(Eq.1) where KA,app. is the measured association constant for heparin chains of N monosaccharide units, and KA,int. is the intrinsic association constant for a heparin chain of minimal binding site size L. The slope of the linear fit of the dependence of equilibrium association constant versus heparin length gives the intrinsic association constant, and the x-intercept is the minimal binding chain length minus one monosaccharide unit. Protease Inhibition Assays—All assays were carried out at room temperature in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% PEG8000, with 5 mm CaCl2 in the APC assay. For thrombin assays, 5 nm thrombin was incubated with 100 nm PCI and at time intervals, reactions were stopped by adding 300 μm S2238 in the same buffer. For APC assays, 10 nm APC and 100 nm PCI were used, with and without 16.7 μg/ml heparin. Reactions were stopped by adding 600 μm S2366 in the assay buffer, with 0.2 mg/ml polybrene included for assays in the presence of heparin. Residual protease activity was determined by change in A405 on a 96-well plate reader, as before (27O'Keeffe D. Olson S.T. Gasiunas N. Gallagher J. Baglin T.P. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50267-50273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Expression and Characterization of Recombinant PCI—Using plasma-derived native PCI we obtained crystals that diffracted to only 3.4-Å resolution. Further optimization was hindered because the RCL of PCI became cleaved after about 2 weeks, which might have been caused by residual protease activity from the plasma preparation. We thus decided to generate recombinant PCI in E. coli. The PCI gene was cloned into pET19b vector and expressed in Rosetta (DE3) pLysS strain, which provides rare codon tRNAs. During purification of recombinant wild-type PCI we discovered a proteolytically susceptible site between His16 and Val17 (data not shown), so we also expressed an N-terminal-truncated version of PCI starting at Val17 (Δ16 PCI). In creating the Δ16 PCI construct, the basic N-terminal region, known as the A+ helix, was removed, allowing us to test the importance of this region for heparin binding and protease recognition. We were eventually able to purify full-length wild-type and the Δ16 PCI variant to homogeneity, and both formed SDS-stable complexes with thrombin and APC (data not shown). The rates of thrombin and APC inhibition by wild-type and Δ16 PCI were essentially identical in the absence and presence of catalytic amounts of heparin (data not shown). However, both recombinant forms inhibited thrombin at a rate slightly higher than plasma-derived PCI, as observed previously for E. coli-derived PCI (43Rehault S.M. Zechmeister-Machhart M. Fortenberry Y.M. Malleier J. Binz N.M. Cooper S.T. Geiger M. Church F.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1748: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Heparin binding affinity, as assessed by elution from heparin-Sepharose, showed a small increase in affinity for the recombinant forms over plasma PCI because of the lack of glycosylation (58Fujita M. Izutani W. Takahashi K. Nishizawa K. Shirono H. Koga J. Thromb. Res. 2002; 105: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and a marginal decrease in affinity for Δ16 relative to wild-type PCI (Table 2). Based on these initial studies, both forms of recombinant PCI were judged to be active and essentially indistinguishable from native PCI obtained from plasma.TABLE 2Heparin affinity of the various forms of PCIPCIConductivityKd with 8mermS/cm×10−7 MNative plasma40.84.6 ± 0.9Native rWT53.71.6 ± 0.2Native Δ1649.62.7 ± 0.5Native R229A43.03.5 ± 0.4Cleaved plasma43.65.7 ± 1.5Cleaved rWT57.41.7 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab General Structural Features—Using native PCI from the Δ16 construct we obtained two different crystal forms. The first form (space group C2) contained three molecules of native PCI per asymmetric unit. This structure was solved to 2.3-Å resolution, and statistics are given in Table 1. Subsequently, a second crystal form (space group P21) was obtained, leading to a 2.0-Å structure with two copies of native PCI in the asymmetric unit (Table 1). Monomers from the first crystal form are denoted C2_A, B, and C, and those from the second form are denoted P21_A and B. The five structures were quite similar (average Cα R.m.s.d. ∼1 Å), and superposition of the monomers provided an NMR-like ensemble of structures to reveal the regions of inherent flexibility (Fig. 1A). Flexibility is notable in the RCL, the helix D region and the very N terminus. The localized flexibility apparent from this superposition is supported by higher average temperature factors in these regions. The overall fold is that of a typical serpin, with a superposition of α1-antitrypsin resulting in a Cα R.m.s.d. of ∼1.5 Å for 321 equivalent atoms; however, some significant differences are observed (Fig. 1B). Of particular interest is the relative accessibility of the RCL and the reactive center P1 Arg residue, the rotation of helices D and H, and the two turn shortening of helix A. A similar superposition with TBG (44Zhou A. Wei Z. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13321-13326Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 1C, and although the sequence identity is lower, the structures are more similar, with the positions of helices D and H preserved. The functional consequence of this structural feature is discussed below. The RCL—Based on structural alignment with the prototypical serpin α1-antitrypsin, the RCL of PCI is 3-4 residues longer (depending on the assignment of the first residue in s1C) through an insertion C-terminal to the P1 residue. While this is also true for some other serpins such as AT, in PCI the extra residues confer a degree of flexibility never before seen in a native serpin. Of the five molecules of native PCI in our two crystal forms, the RCL is only fully modeled in one (P21_A), however, the density is poo"
https://openalex.org/W2050241400,"Mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins form ring-like hexameric complexes that are commonly believed to act as the replicative DNA helicase at the eukaryotic/archaeal DNA replication fork. Because of their simplified composition with respect to the eukaryotic counterparts, the archaeal MCM complexes represent a good model system to use in analyzing the structural/functional relationships of these important replication factors. In this study the domain organization of the MCM-like protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso MCM) has been dissected by trypsin partial proteolysis. Three truncated derivatives of Sso MCM corresponding to protease-resistant domains were produced as soluble recombinant proteins and purified: the N-terminal domain (N-ter, residues 1–268); a fragment comprising the AAA+ and C-terminal domains (AAA+-C-ter, residues 269–686); and the C-terminal domain (C-ter, residues 504–686). All of the purified recombinant proteins behaved as monomers in solution as determined by analytical gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the polypeptide chain integrity is required for stable oligomerization of Sso MCM. However, the AAA+-C-ter derivative, which includes the AAA+ motor domain and retains ATPase activity, was able to form dimers in solution when ATP was present, as analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation analyses. Interestingly, the AAA+-C-ter protein could displace oligonucleotides annealed to M13 single-stranded DNA although with a reduced efficiency in comparison with the full-sized Sso MCM.

The eukaryotic MCM complex consists of six paralogous polypeptides (MCM 2–7) belonging to the AAA+ (ATPases with other associated cellular activities) superfamily (5Erzberger J.P. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2006; 85: 91-114Google Scholar). More recently, an additional MCM paralogous protein, named MCM 8, has been characterized from Xenopus laevis and found to form homohexamers in solution endowed with ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity (6Maiorano D. Cuvier O. Danis G. Mechali M. Cell. 2005; 120: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MCM 8 orthologous genes have been identified in other metazoan, but the biological function of this protein complex has not yet been clarified. All of the MCM proteins contain the highly conserved ATPase sequence boxes in their central region, which is the most conserved portion of their polypeptide chain. They have been purified from cell extracts of several eukaryotic organisms as stable complexes of various composition (7Thommes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J.

A. 2001; 98: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This is likely due to the absence in these highly purified samples of additional protein factors responsible for the activation of the DNA unwinding function of the MCM complex in vivo (12Moyer S.E. Lewis P.W. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 10236-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Consistently, genetic analyses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has demonstrated that all six components of the MCM 2–7 complex are required not only in the initiation but also in the elongation phase of DNA replication (13Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Despite this notion, the most important piece of evidence that the MCM hexameric complex is responsible for DNA unwinding at the replication fork came from the biochemical characterization of the MCM proteins of Archaea (14Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of the MCM complex from Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum (Mth MCM, 15–17), Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso MCM, 18), and Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Afu MCM, 19) revealed that these enzymes have 3′–5′ helicase, double-stranded and single-stranded (ss)DNA binding and ATPase activity. Because of their simplified composition, higher stability, and robust and processive in vitro DNA helicase activity, archaeal MCM complexes were found to be useful models to analyze structure/function relationships of these important AAA+ superfamily members. Structural studies by electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography of the Mth MCM protein revealed that it can exist as a hexamer (20Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1078-1083Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), heptamer (21Yu X. vanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H.

Biol. 2005; 346: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sso MCM and Afu MCM were both found to form hexamers in solution (18Carpentieri F. De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M.

Here we have analyzed the modular organization of Sso MCM by limited proteolysis of the full-sized protein and biochemical analysis of deleted forms corresponding to protease-resistant domains. Interestingly, we have demonstrated for the first time that a N-terminally deleted form of the protein (residues 268–686), which includes the AAA+ motor domain, retains DNA helicase activity and the extreme C-terminal domain (residues 504–686) displays DNA binding capability. The results of this analysis provide further insights into the structure/function relationship of the MCM protein. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade. Restriction and modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from GE Healthcare. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Proligo (Paris, France). Construction of the Plasmid Vectors for the Expression of the His-tagged Sso MCM and Its Truncated Derivatives—The construct for the expression of Sso MCM with a His6 tag at the C-terminal end was generated by a PCR-based approach using the pET19b-SsoMCM vector as the template (18Carpentieri F. De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotide MCM-Nco-for (5′-GGTTGGCCATGGTTGGAAATTCCTAGTAAACAGATT-3′) as the forward primer (the NcoI restriction site is underlined in the reported sequence) and the oligonucleotide MCM-686-Xho-rev (5′-GGTTGGCTCGAGGACTTTTTTGTAACATTCTGGTTTTGCTTCAT-3′) as the reverse primer (the XhoI restriction site is underlined in the reported sequence). The amplified MCM gene was subcloned into NcoI/XhoI-linearized pET28a vector (Novagen) to create the pET28a-SsoMCM-His plasmid. The Sso MCM truncated derivatives were generated with a PCR-based approach using the plasmid containing the Sso MCM full-length gene as the template. Sso MCM N-ter was constructed with the oligonucleotide MCM-Nde-for (5′-GTTTGTTTCATATGTTGGAAATTCCTAGTAAACA-3′) as the forward primer (the NdeI restriction site is underlined in the sequence) and the oligonucleotide MCM-268-Eco-rev (5′-GTTTGTTTGAATTCCTATTTTTGTGAAACTTCTATACT-3′) as the reverse primer. This latter oligonucleotide introduces a translational stop after codon 268 of the Sso MCM gene followed by an EcoRI restriction site, which is underlined in the reported sequence. Sso MCM AAA+-C-ter was generated using the oligonucleotide MCM-NheI-for (5′-GTTGTTGTTAGCTAGCGTATTAGATGAGGTAATC-3′) as the forward primer (the NheI restriction site is underlined in the reported sequence) and the oligonucleotide MCM-686-Eco-rev (5′-ATTGGAATTCCTAGACTTTTTTGTAACATTC-3′) as the reverse primer. This latter oligonucleotide introduces a translational stop after codon 686 of the Sso MCM gene, followed by an EcoRI restriction site, which is underlined in the reported sequence. Sso MCM C-ter was generated with the oligonucleotide MCM-Cter-Nco-for (5′-TTGGCCATGGGCGATGTACATTCAGGAAAATCC-3′) as the forward primer (the NcoI restriction site is underlined in the reported sequence) and the oligonucleotide MCM-686-Xho-rev as the reverse primer. The PCR products were cloned into the pET28a vector digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes to create the following constructs: pET28a-AAA+-C-ter, pET28a-C-ter, and pET28a-N-ter, which direct the expression of the Sso MCM AAA+-C-ter protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, the Sso MCM C-ter protein with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag, and the Sso MCM N-ter protein with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, respectively. The insert of each plasmid construct was sequenced to verify that mutations had not been introduced during PCR. Production of the Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli—All recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta cells (Novagen) transformed with the corresponding expression vectors. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in 4 liters of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.8, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.2 mm. The bacterial culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -20 °C until use. Determination of Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was estimated by the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) from titration curves made with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purification of Full-sized His-tagged Sso MCM and Its Truncated Derivatives—The recombinant E. coli cells pellet was thawed and resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cells were broken by two consecutive passages through a French pressure cell apparatus (Aminco, Silver Spring, MD) at 2000 p.s.i. (1 p.s.i. = 6.9 kilopascals). The resulting cell extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 rpm (Beckman 70 Ti rotor) at 10 °C. The supernatant of the wild type protein was treated at 80 °C for 10 min and then incubated in ice for 10 min. The thermoprecipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 rpm (Beckman 70 Ti rotor) at 10 °C. The supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore) and loaded onto a 5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate Superflow-agarose column (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated in buffer A. After a washing step with buffer A, the elution was carried out with 70 ml of an imidazole stepwise gradient (25–500 mm) in buffer A. 1.0-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect the Sso MCM polypeptide. Fractions containing the recombinant protein (elution step with 100 and 200 mm imidazole) were pooled. The pool (volume, 20 ml) was dialyzed overnight against buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled dialyzed against buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). The dialyzed sample was concentrated up to a volume of 2 ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration apparatus (Millipore) equipped with a YM-30 membrane. The final yield of the recombinant protein after this purification procedure was about 1.5 mg. The Sso MCM deleted proteins were purified from E. coli cell extracts essentially as described for the full-sized His-tagged protein, except that the heat treatment was omitted and, for the N-ter and AAA+-C-ter proteins, the nickel-chelate chromatography was followed by gel filtration onto a Superdex G 75 HR 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol). A detailed description of the purification procedures is available upon request. Gel Filtration Chromatography Experiments—Samples of the purified wild type His-tagged Sso MCM (100 μg in 250 μl) were subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was calibrated by running a set of gel filtration markers that included thyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). A sample of the purified Sso MCM AAA+-Cter protein (100 μg in 250 μl) was subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was calibrated by running a set of gel filtration markers that included ferritin (440 kDa, 61 Å, Ve = 10.23 ml), catalase (232 kDa, 52.2 Å, Ve = 11.89 ml), aldolase (158 kDa, 48.1 Å, Ve = 12.28 ml), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 35.5 Å, Ve = 13.28 ml), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 30.5 Å, Ve = 14.28 ml), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, 20.09 Å, Ve = 16.47 ml). Samples of the purified Sso MCM N-ter and C-ter proteins (100 μg in 250 μl) were subjected to analytical gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer C. The column was calibrated as described previously for the Superdex 200 column. To determine the oligomeric state of the AAA+-C-ter protein in the presence of ATP, analytical gel filtration experiments were carried out using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30, which was equilibrated and developed in buffer C containing 5 mm ATP. In all gel filtration experiments the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blot with anti-Sso MCM polyclonal antibodies as described previously (18Carpentieri F. De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation was performed by applying the AAA+-C-ter protein (45 μg in 150 μl) to an 8-ml 20–40% glycerol gradient in buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm Mg Cl2, 100 mm NaCl with or without 5 mm ATP. A parallel gradient was used to fractionate a mixture of standard proteins, which included the following: catalase (232 kDa, 11.3 S), aldolase (158 kDa, 7.3 S), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 4.6 S), ovalbumin (43 kDa, 3.5 S), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, 2.5 S). After centrifugation at 38,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 10 °C, fractions (250 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed by Western blot to determine the distribution of the AAA+-C-ter protein or by Coomassie Blue staining to detect the standard proteins. Limited Proteolysis Analyses—A sample of purified His-tagged Sso MCM protein (70 μg in 360 μl) was incubated at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 153 μm CaCl2, and 100 ng of trypsin (Worthington). Aliquots (40 μl) were withdrawn at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE stop solution (1.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 600 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS and 0.06% (w/v) bromphenol blue) to each aliquot. Samples were then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and run on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Sigma). For the N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses, a sample of the purified Sso MCM (70 μg in 360 μl) was digested with trypsin (100 ng) at 37 °C for 75 min as described previously. The proteolytic products were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane Pro-Blott (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as described (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Precise gas-phase sequencer (model 494, Applied Biosystems). ATPase Assay—ATPase assay reaction buffer contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. ATP was mixed with [γ-32P]ATP and titrated into 20-μl reactions containing the indicated amounts of protein. Initial velocity values were determined by analyzing aliquots taken from each reaction mixture after incubation for 0.5 and 1 min at 60 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped in ice. 1 μl of each aliquot was spotted on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plate (Merck), which was prerun with 1 m formic acid and developed in 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The amounts of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolyzed to [32P]orthophosphate were quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The amount of spontaneously hydrolyzed ATP was determined using blank reactions without enzyme and subtracted from the reaction rate values calculated as described above. Kinetic data were analyzed using the GraFit program (version 5.1). Assays were performed in triplicate, and the results were averaged. The error bars on the graphs are the standard error of the mean. DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After the labeling reaction, oligonucleotides were purified using Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Tris chromatography columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Bub-20T-Top oligonucleotide (5′-TCTACCTGGACGACCGGG(T)20GGGCCAGCAGGTCCATCA-3′) was used as a single-stranded DNA in the band-shift experiments. For the preparation of the DNA helicase substrate, an 85-mer synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-TTGAACCACCCCCTTGTTAAATCACTTCTACTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCG-3′) was used. This oligonucleotide is complementary to the M13mp18(+) strand with the exception of a 30-nucleotide 5′-tail (the tail is underlined). The oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and after the labeling reaction it was purified using a Quantum Prep PCR Kleen spin column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare partial duplex DNA molecules, mixtures containing equal molar amounts of each oligonucleotide and the M13mp18(+) strand were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then slowly cooled at room temperature. DNA Band-shift Assays—For each substrates, 10 μl-mixtures were prepared, which contained 200 fmol of [32P]-labeled DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the indicated amounts of protein. Following incubation for 10–15 min at room temperature, complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 5% poly(bisacrylamide) gels (37.5:1) in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were dried down and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were averaged. The error bars on the graphs are the standard error of the mean. Where saturation was reached, dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by fitting data to a single-site saturation curve with the following equation: [bound protein] = capacity[free protein]/Kd + [free protein]. The program GraFit (version 5.1) was used for these calculations. DNA Helicase Assay—Helicase assay reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm ATP, and 50 fmol of 32P-labeled substrate (about 1 × 103 cpm/fmol). The reactions were incubated for 30 min at 70 °C in a heated-top PCR machine to prevent evaporation and stopped by addition of 5 ml of 5× stop solution (0.5% SDS, 40 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue); then they were run on an 8% poly(bisacrylamide) gel (29:1) in Tris borate-EDTA buffer containing 0.1% SDS at constant voltage of 150 V. After electrophoresis the gel was soaked in 20% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by phosphorimaging. The reaction products were quantified, and any free oligonucleotide in the absence of enzyme was subtracted. Limited Tryptic Digestion of Sso MCM—The availability of highly purified recombinant Sso MCM made it feasible to utilize partial trypsin digestion under native conditions to investigate the domain structure of this protein. Limited proteolysis experiments are based on the observation that endoproteases prefer unstructured substrates that are flexible and able to adopt a conformation that fits their catalytic sites. Thus, under mild conditions, preferential sites of proteolytic attack within a folded protein are segments with the highest conformational mobility, hydrophilicity, and exposure to the solvent. Because interdomain linkers usually possess the features noted above, controlled proteolysis experiments allow us to locate domain boundaries of multimodular proteins. In an initial set of experiments, we analyzed the proteolytic products obtained by varying either the trypsin/Sso MCM ratio or the digestion time at a fixed protease/protein ratio. This analysis was used to determine the best conditions for identifying stable proteolytc products. A typical example of a limited digestion time course experiment is given in Fig. 1A. Purified recombinant His-tagged Sso MCM was subjected to partial proteolysis with trypsin for 120 min at a protease/protein ratio of 1/700 (w/w). The 78-kDa band corresponding to the full-sized protein gradually disappeared and was almost completely cleaved at the end of the experiment. Two major protein bands of about 50 and 31 kDa rapidly increased within the first 45 min of incubation. Then, the intensity of the 50-kDa band was slightly reduced, and at the same time, a band of about 22 kDa was detected, the intensity of which gradually increased. The Sso MCM fragments, which were obtained after a 75-min incubation with trypsin, were identified by sequential Edman degradation analysis after separation by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (the partial N-terminal sequences are reported in Fig. 1A). This analysis revealed that the proteolytic product of about 50 kDa starts with Ala251 and is likely to include the C-terminal end of the Sso MCM His-tagged polypeptide chain (residues 251–686, expected molecular size of 50 kDa). The 31-kDa protein band was found to contain two polypeptides, one starting with the N-terminal Met residue and the other one with Ala251. Based on these findings, we argue that the polypeptide chain around residue 251 is flexible and easily accessible to the proteolytic attack, because cleavage at this site takes place with a very fast kinetic. Trypsin cleavage at Ala251 produces an N-terminal fragment of about 31 kDa (amino acid residues 1–250) and a larger C-terminal proteolytic product of about 50 kDa (amino acid residues 251–686). N-terminal sequence analysis of the 22-kDa proteolytic fragment revealed that it starts with residue 503. Cleavage at this site takes place with a slower kinetic with respect to that at residue 251, as indicated by the later appearance of the 22-kDa protein band. This analysis suggests that Sso MCM consists of the protease-resistant modules that are depicted schematically in Fig. 1B: the N-terminal domain, which corresponds to the polypeptide chain N-terminal third; the domain named AAA+-C-ter, which contains the remaining C-terminal portion of the protein; and the C-terminal domain, which includes the protein C-terminal third. Production of Sso MCM Truncated Forms—To investigate whether Sso MCM had a modular organization, as suggested by the results of the partial proteolysis experiments, we produced deleted forms of this protein and analyzed their biochemical properties. Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of the polypeptide chain of Sso MCM and the truncated derivatives produced for this study. The protein named N-ter was designed to include residues 1–268 (molecular size of about 31 kDa) and not residues 1–251, because Sso MCM primary sequence analysis revealed that residue 251 (where trypsin cleavage takes place) is located between the loop and the C-terminal β-strand of the N-terminal β-hairpin finger (26Pucci B. De Felice M. Rossi M. Onesti S. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49222-49228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The AAA+-C-ter derivative (residues 269–686, molecular size of about 46 kDa) contains the entire AAA+ motor domain and the C-terminal third of the Sso MCM protein. C-ter includes this latter portion of the polypeptide chain (residues 504–686, molecular size of about 21 kDa) which contains a putative HTH (helix-turn-helix) DNA-binding motif (23Costa A. Pape T. van Heel M. Brick P. Patwardhan A. Onesti S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5829-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also attempted to produce the Sso MCM fragment, which includes residues 269–503 in E. coli, but the recombinant protein was found to be chronically insoluble. 3B. Pucci and F. M. Pisani, unpublished observations. As a matter of fact, multiple sequence alignments revealed that Sso MCM residue 503 is located between the Sensor 1 and Sensor 2 conserved sequence motifs; and a larger fragment of the Sso MCM protein, which also includes the putative Sensor 2 (residues 269–510), turned out to be soluble when produced in recombinant form. 3B. Pucci and F. M. Pisani, unpublished observations. The N-ter and AAA+-C-ter derivatives were produced in E. coli as N-terminally His-tagged proteins, whereas the C-ter form bears a His tag at the C-terminal end. All of these truncated proteins were found to be overexpressed in soluble form in E. coli cells and were purified using a procedure that included a chromatographic step on a Ni2+-chelate column followed by ionic exchange chromatography. To assess the oligomeric state of these proteins, gel filtration experiments were carried out on a Superose 6 column (for the full-length Sso MCM protein), a Superdex 200 column (for the AAA+-C-ter derivative), and a Superdex 75 column (for the N-ter and C-ter proteins) as shown in Fig. 3.

https://openalex.org/W2007648437,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an integral regulator of many cellular functions. EGFR also acts as a central conduit for extracellular signals involving direct activation of the receptor by EGFR ligands or indirect activation by G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-stimulated transactivation of the EGFR. We have previously shown that EGFR negatively regulates epithelial chloride secretion as a result of transforming growth factor-α-mediated EGFR transactivation in response to muscarinic GPCR activation. Here we show that direct activation of the EGFR by EGFR ligands produces a different pattern of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase recruitment than GPCR-stimulated transactivation of the EGFR occurring via paracrine EGFR ligand release. Moreover, we demonstrate that this differential signaling and its consequences depend on protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity. Thus protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B governs differential recruitment of signaling pathways involved in EGFR regulation of epithelial ion transport. Our findings furthermore establish how divergent signaling outcomes can arise from the activation of a single receptor.

Our findings furthermore establish how divergent signaling outcomes can arise from the activation of a single receptor. All cell types rely on a limited set of receptors and signaling intermediates to translate extracellular information into appropriate acute and chronic changes in cellular behavior. Furthermore, many receptors mediate their effects via the secondary recruitment of other receptor types, including by stimulating the release of ligands for the downstream receptor (1Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 2Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). A well studied example of this paradigm relates to cross-talk between G-protein-coupled receptors and a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. In some cases this receptor-tyrosine kinase “transactivation” results in different downstream consequences than does direct activation of the receptor with its endogenous ligand (3Barrett K.E. Smitham J. Traynor-Kaplan A. Uribe J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C958-CC965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, a fundamental question remains as to how a single receptor, after activation by binding of either exogenous or endogenous ligand, can recruit distinct sets of downstream effectors and associated physiological outcomes. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 2The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor; CCh, carbachol; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PAO, phenylarsine oxide; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TGF-α, transforming growth factor α; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. is one of four members of the ErbB receptor family, the other members being ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Although ErbB2 has no known ligand of its own, it possesses the greatest enzymatic activity of the four isoforms and is the preferred dimerization partner for the other three receptors (5Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). The complexity of ErbB receptor activity is amplified by the large number of peptide ligands described for these receptors. All of these peptides originate as transmembrane precursors that are then enzymatically cleaved, thus releasing mature soluble ligands, including the EGFR ligands, EGF, and transforming growth factor α (TGF-α). The latter is the most abundant EGFR ligand found in the gastrointestinal tract (6Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 7Cartlidge S.A. Elder J.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 60: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, ErbB receptors undergo autophosphorylation and dimerization to form catalytically active homo- or heterodimers (8Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2006; 125: 1137-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). The composition of these receptor dimers dictates the recruitment of signaling pathways, adding another level of complexity to transduction of extracellular signals by this receptor family (5Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 9Lenferink A.E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. van De Poll M.L. van Vugt M.J. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E.

Downstream interaction with SH2 domain-containing molecules depends on the type of dimer formed, reflected in the ultimate recruitment of different signaling effectors such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In addition, after binding to the EGFR, different EGFR ligands have variable effects on the ErbB receptor isoforms that are recruited and activated. This diversifies dimer formation and subsequent downstream signaling even though the ligands bind to the same receptor (6Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 10Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Intestinal epithelial cells form a continuous monolayer that lines the intestinal tract. These cells are responsible for the uptake of nutrients, for forming a barrier against pathogens and environmental toxins, and for the tightly regulated absorption and secretion of ions and water. The active secretion of chloride ions provides the driving force for intestinal fluid secretion. The critical importance of regulatory mechanisms governing fluid secretory processes is highlighted by pathological conditions where regulation is impaired. The most dramatic example of excessive chloride and fluid secretion is cholera (11Barrett K.E. Keely S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 535-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Complex mechanisms regulate intestinal ion transport, and our laboratory has identified a critical role for the EGFR as a central regulator that limits ion transport stimulated by calcium-dependent agents such as the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (CCh). We have previously shown that the G protein-coupled receptor agonist, CCh, which stimulates chloride secretion across monolayers of T84 colonic epithelial cells, also transactivates the EGFR. This leads in turn to activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and a later reduction in the level of chloride secretion (4Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Exogenously added EGF can also inhibit CCh-stimulated chloride secretion (4Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of CCh-stimulated transactivation versus EGF-dependent activation of the EGFR are, however, attributable to different downstream mechanisms. Divergent signaling evoked by these two stimuli appears to occur at the level of the EGFR, since direct binding of EGF to EGFR causes recruitment of the ErbB2 receptor to form a heterodimer with the EGFR, whereas CCh-stimulated transactivation does not recruit ErbB2 (4Keely S.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33449-33454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibitory effect of EGF on CCh-stimulated Cl– secretion is mediated by activation of PI3K; however, CCh-induced activation of the EGFR does not cause an increase in the lipid kinase activity of PI3K (14Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have also shown that CCh transactivation of EGFR is mediated by the extracellular release of TGF-α (15McCole D.F. Keely S.J. Coffey R.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42603-42612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that TGF-α and EGF may have different signaling properties in colonic epithelial cells despite both being ligands for EGFR. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate whether differences between EGF- and TGF-α-stimulated ErbB activation and downstream signal recruitment explain the previously observed signaling divergence between direct and indirect activation of the EGFR by EGF and CCh. respectively. In fact, we find that EGFR responses to TGF-α and their downstream signaling consequences are modified by the signaling milieu that exists in CCh-stimulated cells. Materials—Carbachol (Sigma), LY294002, recombinant human transforming growth factor α, Tyrphostin AG825, wortmannin (Calbiochem), recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt1, rabbit anti-Akt1, mouse anti-human EGF receptor (clone LA1) and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), phosphorylation site-specific EGFR tyrosine antibodies (BioSource, Camarillo, CA), and Tris-glycine electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) were obtained from the sources noted. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Neu (ErbB2) and rabbit polyclonal anti-human EGFR (1005) antibody, used to measure total EGFR, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained commercially. Cell Culture—All experiments were performed using monolayers of the T84 human colonic crypt carcinoma cell line. Methods for maintenance of T84 cells in culture were described previously (14Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, T84 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s/F-12 medium (JRH, Lenexa, Kansas) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum. For voltage clamp experiments, 5 × 105 cells were seeded onto 12-mm Millicell-HA filters. For Western blotting experiments, 106 cells were seeded onto 30-mm Millicell-HA filters. Cells were cultured for 10–15 days before use. When grown on filters, T84 cells are known to acquire the polarized phenotype of native colonic epithelia (16Madara J.L. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2124-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In accordance with the known distribution of their receptors on intestinal epithelia, CCh, EGF, and TGF-α were added basolaterally in all experiments (17Wahawisan R. Wallace L.J. Gaginella T.S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1986; 38: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Playford R.J. Hanby A.M. Gschmeissner S. Peiffer L.P. Wright N.A. McGarrity T. Gut. 1996; 39: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological Studies—T84 cell monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers (window area = 0.6 cm2) and bathed in oxygenated (95% O2, 5%CO2) Ringers’ solution at 37 °C. The composition of the Ringer’s solution was 140 mm Na+, 5.2 mm K+, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 0.8 mm Mg2+, 120 mm Cl–, 25 mm HCO3-, 2.4 mm H2PO4-, 0.4 mm HPO42-, and 10 mm glucose. Monolayers were voltage-clamped to zero potential difference by the application of short-circuit current (Isc). Under these conditions, changes in Isc (ΔIsc) in response to agonists are wholly reflective of electrogenic chloride secretion (19Cartwright C.A. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Dharmsathaphorn K. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting—T84 cell monolayers were washed (×3) with Ringer’s solution, equilibrated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then stimulated with agonists (with and without antagonists) as appropriate. The reaction was stopped by washing in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysing in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA in PBS) for 45 min. Cells were then scraped from the filters into microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Cell lysate supernatants were assayed for protein content (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) and adjusted so that each sample contained an equal amount of protein. For immunoprecipitation studies, cell lysate supernatants were incubated with immunoprecipitating antibody for 1 h at 4 °C followed by 1 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (×3) and resuspended in 2× gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, 0.2 bromphenol blue). Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science) of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Densitometric analysis of Western blots was carried out using NIH Image software. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—T84 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells in T75 flasks 72 h before the first transfection and allowed to reach 50–70% confluency. Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B SMARTpool siRNA reagent containing 4 pooled siRNA duplexes was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology/Dharmacon (Chicago, IL), and 100 pmol of siRNA was transfected into T84 cell suspension using the Amaxa nucleofector system (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded onto permeable supports and incubated for 66 h. After culture, cells were stimulated with CCh, EGF, or Ringer’s solution for the indicated periods of time. A nonspecific control siRNA SMARTpool (100 pmol) was used as negative control (Upstate). Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as the means ± S.E. for a series of n experiments. Student’s t tests or analysis of variance with the Student-Newman-Keul’s post hoc test were used to compare mean values as appropriate. p values <0.05 were considered to represent significant differences. EGF and TGF-α Have Different Potencies in Stimulating Phosphorylation of the EGFR and ErbB2 in the Colonic Epithelial Cell Line, T84—We first set out to investigate whether the EGFR agonists EGF and TGF-α were equipotent in inducing EGFR phosphorylation in T84 human colonic epithelial cells. Polarized T84 cells, grown on permeable supports, were treated basolaterally with CCh (100 μm; 2 min), EGF (16.7 nm; 5 min), or a range of concentrations of TGF-α (1.67–50.1 nm; 5 min). The duration of CCh or growth factor treatment has previously been shown by our group to be optimal for stimulation of EGFR phosphorylation in this system (12Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, the concentration of CCh used is physiologically relevant and is well established as the prototypic stimulus of GPCR-induced calcium-dependent chloride secretion across intestinal epithelial cells by our group and others (13Uribe J.M. Gelbmann C.M. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C914-C922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Laburthe M. Augeron C. Rouyer-Fessard C. Roumagnac I. Maoret J.J. Grasset E.

Investig. 1995; 96: 386-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cell lysate supernatants immunoprecipitated with an anti-EGFR antibody and probed for phosphotyrosine showed that CCh and EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation as expected (Fig. 1A). Total EGFR levels are shown in Fig. 1B. TGF-α also induced EGFR phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, with 8.35 nm being the lowest effective dose. However, densitometric analysis revealed that a 3-fold higher dose of TGF-α (50.1 nm) was required to induce EGFR phosphorylation at levels equivalent to that induced by EGF (16.7 nm)(p < 0.05; n = 4; Fig. 1C). This observation was further explored in a separate set of experiments where T84 cells were treated basolaterally with CCh (100 μm; 2 min), TGF-α (33.4 nm; 5 min), or a range of EGF concentrations (0.167–16.7 nm; 5 min) (Fig. 1D). EGF was not tested at concentrations higher than 16.7 nm due to the marked potency of this concentration compared with higher concentrations of TGF-α, as shown in Fig. 1C. EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Total EGFR levels are shown in Fig. 1E. Densitometric analysis showed that EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation stimulated by EGF at 8.35 nm was comparable with that induced by a 4-fold higher concentration of TGF-α (33.4 nm) (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, EGF induced significant EGFR phosphorylation at 1.67 nm (p < 0.05; n = 4; Fig. 1F), whereas the lowest concentration of TGF-α that stimulated EGFR phosphorylation was 8.35 nm. These data indicate that EGF is significantly more potent than TGF-α at inducing EGFR phosphorylation in colonic epithelial cells. Having shown that EGF is a more potent inducer of EGFR activation than TGF-α, we next investigated whether this difference in potency also applied to ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation. Confluent monolayers of polarized T84 cells were treated basolaterally with CCh (100 μm; 2 min), EGF (16.7 nm; 5 min), or a range of concentrations of TGF-α (8.35–167 nm). As reported previously, EGF, but not CCh, induced ErbB2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, TGF-α was unable to cause ErbB2 phosphorylation at concentrations below 33.4 nm (Figs. 1, G and I). Thus, concentrations of TGF-α that were capable of inducing EGFR phosphorylation (cf. Fig. 1C) did not phosphorylate ErbB2 (Fig. 2I). This apparent difference in potency was more fully investigated by testing the ability of a range of EGF concentrations to induce ErbB2 phosphorylation in T84 cells (representative blots for phosphorylated and total ErbB2 shown in Figs. 1, J and K). EGF induced significant ErbB2 phosphorylation at a concentration of 8.35 nm (p < 0.05 versus control; n = 4; Fig. 1L). The level of phosphorylation induced by EGF at this concentration was significantly greater than that induced by 33.4 nm TGF-α (p < 0.05; n = 4). These data suggest that EGF is also markedly more potent than TGF-α at inducing ErbB2 phosphorylation. TGF-α Inhibition of Ca2+-dependent Cl– Secretion Does Not Require ErbB2 Activation—We next explored the significance of our data for regulation of Ca2+-dependent transepithelial chloride secretion. We investigated whether EGFR-mediated inhibition of Ca2+-dependent chloride secretion and, specifically, inhibition produced by TGF-α required activation of the ErbB2 receptor. Confluent monolayers of T84 cells were mounted in Ussing chambers. Basolateral application of CCh (100 μm) stimulated a rapid transepithelial Cl– transport response (Fig. 2A). Maximal inhibition of CCh-stimulated Isc was achieved after pretreatment with TGF-α at a concentration of 1.67 nm (p < 0.001; n = 4). This concentration of TGF-α is well below the concentration required to stimulate ErbB2 receptor phosphorylation (cf. Fig. 1I), suggesting that ErbB2 is unlikely to be involved in TGF-α-stimulated inhibition of Cl– secretion. Having shown that TGF-α could maximally inhibit CCh-stimulated Isc at concentrations below those required to activate the ErbB2 receptor, we set out to confirm these findings by blocking ErbB2 activation and examining any effect on the ability of TGF-α to inhibit secretory responses to CCh in T84 cells. Our approach was to use a pharmacologic inhibitor of ErbB2 activation, tyrphostin AG825 (22Osherov N. Gazit A. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11134-11142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we confirmed that AG825 could block TGF-α stimulation of ErbB2 phosphorylation. Fig. 2B shows a representative Western blot of immunoprecipitated ErbB2 prepared from cell lysate supernatants of cells stimulated with TGF-α (33.4 nm) with or without pretreatment with AG825 (1 or 10 μm; 30 min) and probed for phosphotyrosine. AG825 inhibited TGF-α-induced ErbB2 phosphorylation at both 1 μm (42 ± 12% inhibition; p < 0.01; n = 4) and 10 μm (65 ± 13% inhibition; p < 0.001; n = 4; Fig. 2E). AG825 had no effect on the ability of TGF-α to induce EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, AG825 did not affect the ability of EGF to induce phosphorylation of the EGFR itself (Fig. 2F). Because AG825 can effectively block TGF-α stimulation of ErbB2 activation, we next investigated whether ErbB2 activation is required for the inhibitory effect of a high concentration of TGF-α on CCh-stimulated Isc.T84 cell monolayers were mounted in Ussing chambers and preincubated bilaterally for 30 min with AG825 at 1 or 10 μm or with vehicle control. TGF-α significantly inhibited the Isc response to CCh whether or not AG825 was present (Fig. 2G). These data combined with the data in Fig. 2A suggest that ErbB2 activation is not required for TGF-α-mediated inhibition of the chloride secretory response to CCh. ErbB2 Activation Is Not Required for Activation of PI3K Signaling—Although CCh transactivates the EGFR via the release of TGF-α (15McCole D.F. Keely S.J. Coffey R.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42603-42612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the differential potency of EGF and TGF-α could account for the ability of EGF and CCh to recruit different signals downstream of EGFR. We have previously observed that inhibition of calcium-dependent Cl– secretion by exogenous EGF involves PI3K activation, whereas inhibition of Cl– secretion mediated by CCh-stimulated transactivation of the EGFR likely does not (14Uribe J.M. Keely S.J. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26588-26595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether ErbB2 activation was required for PI3K recruitment, we next investigated whether inhibition of Cl– secretion by exogenous TGF-α, at concentrations that do not activate ErbB2, involved PI3K activation. Western blot analysis showed that TGF-α could activate PI3K signaling, as measured by phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream target, Akt1, on threonine 308. This effect occurred at TGF-α concentrations below those required to phosphorylate ErbB2 (Fig. 3, A and B). These data indicate that TGF-α can likely activate PI3K independent of ErbB2. The involvement of PI3K in TGF-α induced inhibition of Cl– secretion was confirmed by studies demonstrating that the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (50 nm) and LY294002 (20 μm) partially reversed the inhibitory effect of a low concentration of TGF-α, 1.67 nm, on chloride secretion (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, because TGF-α inhibits Cl– secretion via PI3K activation, albeit in an ErbB2-independent fashion, differences in ErbB2 activation likely do not account for differential recruitment of PI3K in the negative regulation of Cl– secretion by direct versus indirect activation of EGFR. Indirect Activation of EGFR Induces a Different Pattern of Tyrosine Phosphorylation than Direct Activation—Because the signaling divergence between direct versus indirect EGFR activation was apparently not mediated at the level of ErbB2 kinase recruitment, we investigated whether the basis for differential signal recruitment by direct versus indirect EGFR activation occurred at the level of EGFR itself. EGFR activation and recruitment of downstream signaling pathways is dependent on phosphorylation of key EGFR tyrosine residues (10Olayioye M.A. Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Rohrer J. Gay B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). EGFR contains four major autophosphorylation sites, Tyr-1173, Tyr-1148, Tyr-1086, and Tyr-1068. EGFR Tyr-1086 and Tyr-1068 are also binding sites for the adaptor protein, Grb2, which is involved in recruitment of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (23Margolis B.L. Lax I. Kris R.

Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously shown that Grb2 associates with the EGFR during CCh-stimulated transactivation (12Keely S.J. Uribe J.M. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27111-27117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Tyr-992 is a minor autophosphorylation site and also serves as a binding site for phospholipase-γ (25Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Tyr-845 is directly phosphorylated by Src kinase and is located in the kinase domain of EGFR (27Sato K. Sato A. Aoto M. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We characterized EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation patterns after stimulation with EGF, CCh, or TGF-α to determine whether differences in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation could account for differential recruitment of ion transport regulatory pathways by EGF versus CCh. T84 monolayers were treated with CCh, EGF, or TGF-α, and lysate supernatants were run on gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were probed with antibodies directed against the phosphorylated forms of EGFR tyrosine residues. EGF, CCh, and TGF-α all increased phosphorylation of the major autophosphorylation sites, Tyr-1173, Tyr-1086, and Tyr-1148, although EGF was a more potent stimulus than TGF-α (Fig. 4, A, B, C, E, and F). However, although both EGF and TGF-α increased phosphorylation of the other major autophosphorylation residue, Tyr-1068, CCh failed to significantly increase phosphorylation of this residue (Fig. 4D). Similarly, treatment of cells with EGF and TGF-α, but not CCh, increased phosphorylation of Tyr-992 (Fig. 4G). On the other hand, all three stimuli increased phosphorylation of Tyr-845, indicating Src recruitment (Fig. 4H). Table 1 summarizes these findings. They indicate that both EGF and TGF-α, albeit with different potencies, are capable of phosphorylating all six of the EGFR tyrosines probed, whereas CCh increases phosphorylation of only four of these residues with no significant increase in the phosphorylation of EGFR residues Tyr-1068 or Tyr-992. We, therefore, investigated whether CCh activates some other regulatory component that modifies EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation produced by autocrine TGF-α. This could account for differential activation of PI3K, since both Tyr-992 and Tyr-1068 of EGFR have been implicated in activation of this enzyme (28Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H.

https://openalex.org/W2075816570,"The environmental pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, dioxin) causes numerous and diverse toxic events via activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, including atrophy of the thymus. Exposure to TCDD induces acute thymocyte cell loss, which occurs concomitantly with proliferation arrest and premature emigration of triple negative (TN; CD4-, CD8-, CD3-) T cell progenitors. In this report, we demonstrate that TCDD exposure results in dysregulation of KLF2 (Kruppel-like factor 2) expression in developing thymocytes. The Klf2 gene encodes an Sp1-like zinc finger transcription factor that functions as a central regulator of T lymphocyte proliferation and trafficking. During normal thymocyte development, KLF2 is expressed exclusively in CD4 and CD8 single positive T cells and promotes a nonproliferative, promigratory phenotype. In mice exposed to TCDD, however, the Klf2 gene is prematurely expressed in TN thymocytes. Administration of a 100 μg/kg dose of TCDD results in a ∼15-fold induction of KLF2 as early as the TN2 (CD44+, CD25+) stage of development and immediately precedes acute cell loss in the TN3, TN4, and double positive (CD4+, CD8+) cell stages. Induction of KLF2 occurs within 12 h of TCDD exposure and is fully dependent on expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. In addition, TCDD exposure alters the expression of several factors comprising the KLF2 regulon, including Edg1/S1P1, β7 integrin, CD52, Cdkn2d (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2D), s100a4, and IL10Rα.

These findings indicate that the pollutant TCDD interferes with early thymopoeisis via ectopic expression of the KLF2 regulon. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) 2The abbreviations used are: TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; DP, double positive; SP, single positive; TCR, T cell receptor; TN, triple negative; TNX, triple negative X; PE, phycoerythrin; RT, reverse transcription; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription. 2The abbreviations used are: TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; DP, double positive; SP, single positive; TCR, T cell receptor; TN, triple negative; TNX, triple negative X; PE, phycoerythrin; RT, reverse transcription; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription. is the most toxic congener of a family of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons produced by common industrial processes (1Schecter A. Birnbaum L. Ryan J.J. Constable J.D. Environ. Res. 2006; 101: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Exposure to TCDD induces thymic atrophy, immune suppression, hepatocellular carcinoma, cleft palate, chloracne, hepatomegaly, cachexia, and several other diverse toxic end points (1Schecter A. Birnbaum L. Ryan J.J. Constable J.D. Environ. Res. 2006; 101: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 2Birnbaum L.S. Tuomisto J. Food Addit. Contam. 2000; 17: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Extensive pharmacological and genetic research has demonstrated that TCDD toxicity is mediated through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR or Ah receptor), a ligand-activated member of the PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) family of environmental sensors (3Poland A. Glover E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 17: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Toxicol. Appl.

Due to widespread human and animal exposure to environmental agonists of the AHR (1Schecter A. Birnbaum L. Ryan J.J. Constable J.D. Environ. Res. 2006; 101: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), these compounds pose a serious threat to public health. In the current study, we investigate how exogenous activation of the AHR provokes atrophy of the thymus. The thymus is the primary source of the T cell repertoire and thus a critical part of the adaptive immune system. Within this organ, T cell development occurs in a series of highly regulated differentiation events (7Gill J. Malin M. Sutherland J. Gray D. Hollander G. Boyd R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 195: 28-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). At the beginning of this developmental process, the thymus is seeded with pluripotent bone marrow progenitors. Interactions with resident stromal cells then induce T lineage commitment and V(D)J rearrangement of the genes encoding the α and β chains of the T cell receptor (TCR) (7Gill J. Malin M. Sutherland J. Gray D. Hollander G. Boyd R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 195: 28-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several surface markers are coordinately regulated during this developmental process and are commonly used to represent specific stages of thymopoeisis (see Fig. 1A). The earliest progenitors within the thymus are negative for the mature surface markers CD4, CD8, and CD3 (8Godfrey D. Kennedy J. Suda T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). These “triple negative” (TN) cells can be further categorized into four ordered developmental stages during which the TCRβ gene is rearranged and then expressed at the cell surface: TN1 (CD44+, CD25-) → TN2 (CD44+, CD25+) → TN3 (CD44-, CD25+) → TN4 (CD44-, CD25-) (8Godfrey D. Kennedy J. Suda T. Zlotnik A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4244-4252PubMed Google Scholar). If TCRβ rearrangement is successful, thymocytes then initiate recombination of TCRα as well as CD4 and CD8 expression (7Gill J. Malin M. Sutherland J. Gray D. Hollander G. Boyd R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 195: 28-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although “double positive” (DP; CD4+, CD8+) cells comprise ∼80% of all thymocytes, the vast majority of these cells fail to generate an appropriate TCRαβ signaling complex (7Gill J. Malin M. Sutherland J. Gray D. Hollander G. Boyd R. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 195: 28-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Only cells that pass both positive and negative TCR selection are released into the bloodstream as CD4 helper or CD8 cytotoxic single positive (SP) T cells. The process of TN development is highly sensitive to TCDD. Exposure to this environmental pollutant results in proliferation arrest of the TN3 and TN4 stages of development (9Laiosa M.D. Wyman A. Murante F.G. Fiore N.C. Staples J.E. Gasiewicz T.A. Silverstone A.E. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as premature emigration of TN3-like thymocytes (10Temchura V.V. Frericks M. Nacken W. Esser C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2738-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that these TN defects are due to cell autonomous changes in gene transcription. Prior research has demonstrated that thymocyte, but not stromal, expression of the AHR signaling pathway is required for TCDD-induced atrophy (9Laiosa M.D. Wyman A. Murante F.G. Fiore N.C. Staples J.E. Gasiewicz T.A. Silverstone A.E. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4582-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Staples J.E. Murante F.G. Fiore N.C. Gasiewicz T.A. Silverstone A.E. J.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant constructs of the Ah receptor have demonstrated that AHR/DNA interactions are required for thymic toxicity (13Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Overall, these results are consistent with the idea that TCDD dysregulates TN expression of a gene, or genes, with a critical role in thymocyte proliferation and/or emigration. In this report, we demonstrate that TCDD triggers misexpression of the KLF2 (Kruppel-like factor 2) regulon in an AHR-dependent manner. During normal thymocyte development, KLF2 is expressed exclusively in the mature SP populations and enforces (i) egress to the peripheral lymphoid organs and (ii) peripheral T cell quiescence (14Puthier D.

Here, we show that the environmental contaminant TCDD induces ectopic expression of the KLF2 transcription factor and its associated regulon during TN thymopoeisis. Mice—“Wild-type” C57BL/6 and Rag-1tm1Mom (Rag-1 null) mice (20Mombaerts P.I.J. Johnson R.S. Herrup K. Tonegawa S. Papaioannoi V.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). AHR null mice (21Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) were obtained from a colony maintained at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). The AHR and Rag-1 null lines were backcrossed to the C57BL/6 genotype for at least 10 generations. Animals were housed in a selective pathogen-free environment and supplied with food and water ad libitum, according to the rules and guidelines of the University of Wisconsin. TCDD Treatment—5–7-week-old males were injected once intraperitoneally with 100 μg/kg body weight TCDD. Me2SO was used as vehicle control at a dose of 1.25 ml/kg body weight. Animals from age-matched litters were used for each experiment. Thymocyte Preparation—Each thymus was homogenized by gentle grinding in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and passage through a 20-gauge needle. Red blood cells were lysed in ammonium chloride buffer (0.17 m NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) for 5 min on ice. Thymocyte samples were then pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide (both from Sigma). Cell Counting—Thymus cell count was determined using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Each thymocyte sample was acquired for 15 s at a 0.2 μl/s flow rate, gated based on forward and side scatter, and then enumerated. Antibodies—The following monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Ebioscience (San Diego, CA) or Pharmingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ) and used at a saturating concentration: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD4 (clone GK1.5; Ebioscience) and CD44 (IM7; Ebioscience); PE-conjugated CD8α (53-6.7; Pharmingen) and CD25 (3C7; Pharmingen); PE-Cy5-conjugated CD3ϵ (145-2C11; Pharmingen) and β7 integrin (FIB504; Pharmingen); APC-conjugated CD3ϵ (145-2C11; Ebioscience), CD11β (M1/70; Ebioscience), CD8α (53-6.7; Ebioscience), CD4 (RM4-5; Ebioscience). Flow Cytometry—Thymocytes were incubated in staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% NaN3) with the appropriate antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C. Each thymocyte sample was stained using two independent antibody mixtures. The CD4/CD8 double positive and single positive cells were analyzed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-CD4 and PE-CD8 antibodies. Triple negative cells were analyzed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-CD44, PE-CD8, PE-Cy5 or APC-CD3ϵ, APC-CD8α, APC-CD4, APC-CD45R, and APC-CD11β antibodies. All cells negative for CD4/8/3/11β/CD45R staining were used for triple negative gating based on CD44 and CD25 expression. After antibody incubation, each sample was washed once with staining buffer and resuspended in staining buffer plus 1% (w/v) formaldehyde. Data were acquired using a FACSCalibur cytometer after calibrating for fluorescence channel overlap using the appropriate staining controls. Quantitation analysis was completed on BD Biosciences Cellquest software. The flow cytometry figures used in this publication were created using WinMDI 2.8 (Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA) or FloJo (Ashland, OR) software. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR—Unfixed cells were sorted at 4 °C using a BD Biosciences FacsVantage SE flow cytometer. Sorting accuracy was determined to be greater than 98% in each experiment. Total RNA was isolated from each cell sample using RNeasy kits with DNase treatment (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantitect RT-PCR kits (Qiagen) were then used for combined reverse transcription and amplification of samples with gene-specific primers (IDT (Coralville, IA) and Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA)). At least three replicate reactions were assayed for each sample using the ABI Prism 7900 system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Equal amounts of total RNA were added to each well as measured by the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Foster City, CA); RNA loading was further normalized to endogenous levels of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase. -Fold change was calculated as 2(ΔCT). RT-PCR primers are provided in the supplemental materials. Microarray Profiling—Total RNA (∼100 ng) was isolated from TN2/TNX (CD44int, CD25high/int) cells, which were sorted from a pool of Rag-1 null mice treated with TCDD or Me2SO for 48 h (n = 8 for each treatment). Microarray comparisons were performed by the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (San Diego, CA), as previously described (see Refs. 22Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I.

Briefly, each RNA was split into duplicate samples, linearly amplified, and then hybridized to GeneAtlas GNF1M high density oligonucleotide arrays (22Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I.

Experimental variations due to differences in RNA amplification or hybridization were assessed using a two-tailed t test between each microarray data set. Expression changes with a p value greater than 0.05 were discarded. Statistics—The analysis of β7 integrin expression (Fig. 4B) was performed using a two-tailed t test. Time course data (Fig. 2) were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni posttest for differences between treatment groups.FIGURE 2Exposure to TCDD induces acute, early cell loss in the TN3, TN4, and DP cell stages. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5) were treated with TCDD or Me2SO over a 7-day time course.

Toward this end, we first set out to identify which stages of thymocyte development were subject to overt TCDD toxicity. As an initial step, all thymocytes were classified into developmental stages based upon surface expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, and CD44 (see Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, we observed that TCDD dramatically altered the canonical pattern of CD44/CD25 expression. Treatment with TCDD consistently induced a novel TN phenotype, which was intermediate in both CD44 and CD25 expression (CD44int, CD25int) (Fig. 1B, boxed region). Due to its unknown relationship to classical thymocyte development, we named this population triple negative X (TNX). In addition to TNX formation, we observed a subtle loss of the late TN2 (CD44int, CD25high) phenotype in mice treated with TCDD (Fig. 1B, arrowhead; note the concave pattern of CD25 expression during TN2 to TN3 development in TCDD-treated mice). We hypothesized that the TN2 and TNX phenotypes were related phenomena (i.e. TN2 stage cells (CD44int, CD25high) were diverted to the TNX phenotype (CD44int, CD25int) by TCDD exposure. To test this hypothesis, we treated Rag-1 null mice, which have a profound developmental block at the TN3 stage of development (20Mombaerts P.I.J. Johnson R.S. Herrup K. Tonegawa S. Papaioannoi V.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 869-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2320) Google Scholar), for 24 h with TCDD or Me2SO. We observed that TCDD treatment markedly attenuated surface expression of CD25 in TN2 stage cells (Fig. 1C). The geometric mean of CD25 expression in control and TCDD-treated TN2 cells was 11,804 and 5028 units, respectively. These results were consistent with the idea that TNX phenotype cells are a TCDD-induced derivative of the late TN2 (CD44int, CD25high) stage of development. We next set out to determine the relationship between TNX formation and TCDD-induced thymic cell loss. Toward this end, we first determined total thymus cellularity over a time course of TCDD exposure. We found that thymocyte cell number was significantly decreased within 72 h in TCDD treated animals; a ∼90% loss of control cell number was observed by 7 days (Fig. 2A). We then asked if cell loss occurred across all thymocyte populations or was specific to select developmental stages. In order to accurately enumerate each population, we designed our fluorescence gating to exclude TNX cells from all other TN populations (Fig. 2B). We then calculated the relative number of cells in each developmental stage by multiplying the percentage of cells in each stage by the previously determined total thymus cell count. Using this method, we observed that TCDD does not significantly affect the cellularity of the TN1 and early TN2 (CD44high) stages of development (Fig. 2C). The cell populations developmentally subsequent to the TN2/TNX stage, however, were significantly reduced in cell number. The TN3, TN4, and DP cell populations each exhibited acute cell loss within 48 h of TCDD exposure. In order to elucidate the molecular events that lead to cell loss, we set out to determine the transcriptional profile of the late TN2 (CD44int) population in both its normal and TCDD-exposed states. To obtain enough RNA for microarray analysis, we sorted TN2/TNX cells from a pool of mice, which were treated with TCDD or Me2SO for 48 h (n = 8 for each treatment). The Rag-1 null genotype was utilized for these experiments due to fluorescence overlap between the TNX and TN4 population, which is present in wild type but not Rag-1 null mice. Total RNA was isolated from each cell population and used to determine global gene expression using high density oligonucleotide microarrays (22Panda S. Antoch M.P. Miller B.H. Su A.I. Schook A.B.

Treatment with TCDD was found to alter the expression of ∼2000 genes greater than 1.5-fold and ∼350 genes greater than 5-fold in each of two arrays.

In order to verify induction of KLF2, we sorted an independent sample of TN2/TNX cells from Rag-1 null mice, which were treated with TCDD or Me2SO for 12 h. Quantitative RT-PCR was then used to measure mRNA expression of KLF2 as well as several genes previously shown to be TCDD-inducible in the thymus, such as Cyp1b1, Scinderin, and Lgals3 (24Frericks M. Temchura V.V. Majora M. Stutte S. Esser C. Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Svensson C. Silverstone A.E. Lai Z.W. Lundberg K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed a robust increase (>5-fold) in each of these mRNA transcripts in response to TCDD, including a 15-fold increase of KLF2 (Fig. 3A). Next, we utilized AHR null mice to determine if the KLF2 response to TCDD was mediated by the AHR and independent of the Rag-1 null genotype. Toward this end, we isolated TN3 stage cells from a pool of C57BL/6 or AHR null mice treated with TCDD or Me2SO for 24 h. The levels of KLF2 and Cyp1b1 mRNA in each treatment group were then measured via qRT-PCR. The Ahr+/+ cell population exhibited a >19-fold increase in both KLF2 and Cyp1b1 mRNA in response to TCDD (Fig. 3B). The cells isolated from AHR null mice, however, did not exhibit induction of either mRNA following TCDD treatment (Fig. 3B). TCDD Induces Misexpression of the KLF2 Regulon—The KLF2 protein is a member of the Sp1 family of transcription factors and a promiscuous regulator of gene expression (26Kaczynski J. Cook T. Urrutia R. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Due to the observed level of KLF2 induction, we reasoned that genes regulated by KLF2 might also be significantly altered by TCDD exposure. In order to test this hypothesis, we surveyed the literature for genes which have been shown to be highly altered (>2.5-fold) by KLF2 overexpression (19Haaland R.E. Yu W. Rice A.P. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 627-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or deficiency (18Carlson C.M. Endrizzi B.T. Wu J. Ding X. Weinreich M.A. Walsh E.R. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Hogquist K.A.

Using this approach, we identified several members of the KLF2 regulon as putative TCDD-inducible genes (Table 3).TABLE 3Exposure to TCDD alters expression of the KLF2 regulon The literature was surveyed for genes that are highly altered (>2.5-fold) by KLF2 overexpression (17Wu J.

https://openalex.org/W2060620101,"The ""Equilibrium Model"" has provided new tools for describing and investigating enzyme thermal adaptation. It has been shown that the effect of temperature on enzyme activity is not only governed by deltaG(double dagger)(cat) and deltaG(double dagger)(inact) but also by two new intrinsic parameters, deltaH(eq) and T(eq), which describe the enthalpy and midpoint, respectively, of a reversible equilibrium between active and inactive (but not denatured) forms of enzyme. Twenty-one enzymes from organisms with a wide range of growth temperatures were characterized using the Equilibrium Model. Statistical analysis indicates that T(eq) is a better predictor of growth temperature than enzyme stability (deltaG(double dagger)(inact)). As expected from the Equilibrium Model, deltaH(eq) correlates with catalytic temperature tolerance of enzymes and thus can be declared the first intrinsic and quantitative measure of enzyme eurythermalism. Other findings shed light on the evolution of psychrophilic and thermophilic enzymes. The findings suggest that the description of the Equilibrium Model of the effect of temperature on enzyme activity applies to all enzymes regardless of their temperature origins and that its associated parameters, deltaH(eq) and T(eq), are intrinsic and necessary parameters for characterizing the thermal properties of enzymes and their temperature adaptation and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1989074039,"Human apoE is a multifunctional and polymorphic protein synthesized and secreted by liver, brain, and tissue macrophages. Here we show that apoE isoforms and mutants expressed through lentiviral transduction display cell-specific differences in secretion efficiency. Whereas apoE3, apoE4, and a natural mutant of apoE4 (apoE-Cys(142)) were efficiently secreted from macrophages, apoE2 and a non-natural apoE mutant (apoE-Cys(112)/Cys(142)) were retained in the perinuclear region and only minimally secreted. The secretory block for apoE2 in macrophages was not affected by the ablation of LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor), ABCA-1, or SR-BI (scavenger receptor class B type I) but was released in the absence of low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP). In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, an anti-apoE antibody pulled down two times more LRP in apoE2-transduced macrophages than in apoE3-expressing macrophages. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE/Western blot analyses showed that macrophage apoE2 is mostly dimeric and multimeric, whereas apoE3 is predominantly monomeric. ApoE2 retention and multimer formation also occurred in human macrophages derived from the monocyte cell line THP-1. These results were specific for macrophages, as in transduced mouse primary hepatocytes: 1) ApoE2 was secreted as efficiently as apoE3 and apoE4; 2) all isoforms were exclusively in monomeric form; 3) there was no co-immunoprecipitation of apoE and LRP. A microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor nearly deleted apoB100 secretion from hepatocytes without affecting apoE secretion. These data show that macrophages retain apoE2, a highly expressed protein carried by about 8% of the human population. Given the role of locally produced apoE in regulating cholesterol efflux, modulating inflammation, and controlling oxidative stress, this unique property of apoE2 may have important impacts on atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2046247581,"The COP9 signalosome is a large multiprotein complex that consists of eight subunits termed CSN1–CSN8. The diverse functions of the COP9 complex include regulation of several important intracellular pathways, including the ubiquitin/proteasome system, DNA repair, cell cycle, developmental changes, and some aspects of immune responses. Nod1 is also thought to be an important cytoplasmic receptor involved in innate immune responses. It detects specific motifs of bacterial peptidoglycan, and this results in activation of multiple signaling pathways and changes in cell function. In this report, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and discovered that Nod1 interacts with several components of the COP9 signalosome through its CARD domain. Moreover, we observed that activation of the Nod1 apoptotic pathway leads to specific cleavage of the subunit CSN6. This cleavage is concomitant with caspase processing and generates a short amino-terminal peptide of 3 kDa. A complete inhibition of this cleavage was achieved in the presence of the broad spectrum pharmacological inhibitor of apoptosis, Z-VAD. Furthermore, overexpression of CLARP, a specific caspase 8 inhibitor, completely blocked cleavage of CSN6. Taken together, these results suggest a critical role of caspase 8 in the processing of CSN6. Moreover, these findings suggest that CSN6 cleavage may result in modifications of functions of the COP9 complex that are involved in apoptosis.

However, there are limited studies linking the COP9 complex to immune pathways in mammals. Here we describe studies that begin to bridge this gap in our knowledge. Nod1 is a cytoplasmic protein that belongs to the Nod/NLR/CATERPILLER protein family. Like many members of this family, Nod1 has been implicated in innate immune responses (20Inohara N.

The minimal structural requirement for Nod1 activators derived from peptidoglycan is the presence of mesodiaminopimelic acid (DAP) 2The abbreviations used are: DAP, mesodiaminopimelic acid; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; CHX, cycloheximide; IFNγ, interferon-γ; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; MEF, murine embryo fibroblasts; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; γTriDAP, Ala-γGlu-diaminopimelic acid; γTC, γTriDAP/TNFα/CHX; CEB, cell extract buffer; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 2The abbreviations used are: DAP, mesodiaminopimelic acid; CARD, caspase recruitment domain; CHX, cycloheximide; IFNγ, interferon-γ; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; MEF, murine embryo fibroblasts; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; γTriDAP, Ala-γGlu-diaminopimelic acid; γTC, γTriDAP/TNFα/CHX; CEB, cell extract buffer; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. linked to the γ-position of glutamic acid (22Girardin S.E.

Nod1 is a tripartite protein with an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a central nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Nod1 has structural homologies to the cytosolic disease-resistant R proteins of plants, with both containing NBD and LRR domains. A large number of R genes have been identified in plants and are notable for their roles in the regulation of the defense against invading pathogens. Now there is accumulating evidence that Nod1 mediates host defense responses to a variety of intracellular pathogens, suggesting that there may be common pathways when R proteins and Nod1 are compared (24Girardin S.E.

As part of our efforts to understand Nod1-dependent activation pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and identified several proteins of the COP9 complex that interact with Nod1. This prompted us to further characterize the interactions identified in the screen and to determine whether activation of Nod1 results in biochemical changes in the COP9 complex. A number of studies link Nod1 activation to apoptotic pathways. For example, among the first studies of Nod1, it was noted that Nod1 interacted with caspase 9 and enhanced caspase 9-mediated apoptosis (29Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S.

More recently, we showed that caspase 8 controlled Nod1-induced apoptosis in two breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and SK-BR3 cells (30da Silva Correia J. Miranda Y. Austin-Brown N. Hsu J. Mathison J.

These data provided us with cell-based model systems to further dissect Nod1-dependent apoptotic pathways. Thus, we addressed the question of whether activation of Nod1 in cells that are undergoing apoptosis results in changes in any of the subunits of the COP9 signalosome. Here we report unanticipated findings showing that proteolysis of one COP9 complex subunit, CSN6, is induced by activation of Nod1 as well as by a number of other proapoptotic signals.

Caspase 9 was cloned into p3XFLAG-CMV-24 (Sigma). CSN6 D23A, D53A, D101A, and D132A/D135A were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with the overlapping extension method by PCR using CSN6 WT DNA template. The nucleotide sequences were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Nod1 fragment (amino acids 1–465) containing the CARD and NBD domains was cloned in pGADT7 vector. Screening was performed according to the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System Protocol (Clontech) in the presence of 5 mm 3-aminotriazole. A GAL4-AD/leukocyte cDNA fusion library in pACT2 vector was screened as recommended by the manufacturer. Positive clones were selected and sequenced for further investigation. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells were washed extensively and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 14 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm leupeptin, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 100 mm sodium fluoride. After incubation for 30 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were recovered. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were precleared once for 20 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and mixed with 0.2 μg of M2 monoclonal antibody for 3 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Immune complexes were allowed to bind to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads overnight, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 7 min. Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline: 50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, or anti-Myc antibody for 2 h and with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at ambient temperature. Specific bands were revealed using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences). Preparation of Cell-free Extracts and Cell-free Reactions—Cell-free extracts were generated from Jurkat cells and 293 cells as described previously (32Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J.

Cells were allowed to swell under hypotonic conditions in CEB for 30 min on ice and were disrupted by homogenization with 30 strokes. Crude extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and other debris. Cell-free reactions were typically set in a 20-μl reaction volume. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of bovine heart cytochrome c to extracts at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml in the presence of 1 mm dATP. Extracts were incubated at 37 °C for up to 2 h. Extracts were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting for determination of caspase activation. In Vitro Cleavage of Recombinant CSN6—Purified recombinant CSN6 protein (200 ng) was diluted in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm dithiothreitol and was incubated with active recombinant caspases (200 units/reaction; Calbiochem) in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Gel Filtration Columns—SK-BR3 cells (1 × 108) were lysed by freeze-thaw in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 14 μm pepstatin A, 100 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to nuclease digestion for 90 min (Benzonase; Sigma). Crude cell extracts were fractionated through a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 500 μl each were collected and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Nod1 Interacts with the COP9 Signalosome—To identify proteins involved in regulation of apoptosis induced by Nod1, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening. The amino-terminal region of Nod1 containing the CARD and the NBD domains (amino acids 1–465) was fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 and used as bait against a human leukocyte cDNA library fused to the activation domain of GAL4. From the 6 × 106 transfectants, two interacting clones were identified. These clones interacted with full-length Nod1 as well as with the CARD-NBD domain of Nod1 in yeast. The sequence of the clones was identical to two subunits of the COP9 signalosome complex, CSN3 and CSN1. When we substituted the LRR domain of Nod1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, neither clone interacted, suggesting a specific interaction between CSN1 and CSN3 with the amino-terminal Nod1 sequences used here (data not shown). The COP9 signalosome is a multiprotein complex that consists of eight subunits that show similarity to components of the 19 S proteasome lid complex (2Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The exact functions of the COP9 signalosome are not clear. The fact that we obtained two proteins from the COP9 signalosome complex prompted us to investigate whether other components of the complex interact with Nod1. We first amplified coding sequences for each CSN component using a cDNA library obtained from HeLa cells. The resultant clones were fused to a vector encoding a FLAG epitope. To demonstrate an interaction between Nod1 and the various COP9 subunits, 293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Nod1 and FLAG-tagged CSN subunits, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Following transfection, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody, and purified proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). As expected, purification of CSN1 and CSN3 led to co-purification of Nod1. Interestingly, subunits CSN5, CSN6, CSN7, and CSN8 also associated with Nod1. Surprisingly, CSN5 and CSN6 showed the strongest interaction of all subunits. No interaction between Nod1 and CSN2 or CSN4 could be detected. Nod1 contains three distinct domains, including a CARD domain that functions as a protein-protein interaction domain triggering intracellular signaling. We therefore tested which of Nod1 domain was involved in association with the COP9 signalosome. We first constructed various deletion mutants, Nod1 ΔCARD, Nod1 ΔLRR, and Nod1 LRR. Fig. 1A shows that Nod1 mutants lacking the N-terminal CARD domain lost the ability to recruit proteins of the COP9 complex. Both Nod1 ΔCARD and Nod1 LRR failed to associate with COP9 proteins, demonstrating that the CARD domain is necessary for association with COP9 components. Fig. 1B shows the association between Nod1 and CSN6 through its CARD domain. We then examined if the endogenous COP9 subunits and Nod1 could be immunoprecipitated together using anti-CSN1 and anti-CSN6 antibodies in HeLa cells overexpressing Myc-Nod1. Nod1 associated with both endogenous CSN6 and CSN1 (Fig. 1C). We next examined the ability of the COP9 complex to interact with Nod2, another member of the NLR family closely related to Nod1. 293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged CSN6 and Myc-tagged Nod2, and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out. Fig. 1D shows that CSN6 was detected in Nod2 immunoprecipitates to the same extent as Nod1. Endogenous CSN6 Is Cleaved following Nod1 Activation, Leading to Apoptosis—We next asked whether the COP9 complex undergoes any modifications following Nod1 activation by γTriDAP. Previously, we showed that the addition of γTriDAP and TNFα to SK-BR3 cells resulted in enhanced Nod1-dependent cellular responses, including apoptosis (30da Silva Correia J. Miranda Y. Austin-Brown N. Hsu J. Mathison J. Xiang R. Zhou H. Li Q. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, we treated SK-BR3 cells with a mixture of γTriDAP/TNFα/CHX (γTC) to induce apoptosis. Cell lysates were prepared following the addition of this mixture, and changes in the structure of COP9 complex subunits were monitored by Western blotting using specific antibodies directed against each CSN subunit. We observed proteolysis of the CSN6 subunit (Fig. 2A). The polyclonal anti-CSN6 antibody we used detected a strong band at 36 kDa. Within 4 h of γTC treatment, the disappearance of CSN6 was clearly visible and concomitant with the appearance of a 33 kDa band. By 8 h, no intact CSN6 was visible in SK-BR3 cells. In contrast, we failed to observe any changes in the apparent molecular weight of any of the other COP9 complex components. To define whether the cleavage of CSN6 resulted from caspase activation, we used three different approaches. First, cells were incubated with cell-permeable caspase inhibitor Z-VAD coincidentally with γTC. This pharmacologic inhibitor effectively blocked the cleavage of CSN6 (Fig. 2B). Second, we observed that SK-BR3 cells stably expressing the caspase 8 inhibitor c-FLIP/CLARP were totally resistant to γTC-induced cell death, and under these conditions we failed to observe cleavage of CSN6 (Fig. 2C). Third, it has been established that the addition of cytochrome c and dATP to Jurkat cell-free extracts triggers a cascade of caspase activation events, a model system that mimics APAF1-dependent caspase activation (32Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). We used this system to confirm the cleavage of CSN6. A specific cleavage of CSN6 upon exposure of Jurkat cell extracts to cytochrome c/dATP could be observed (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the time course of activation of CSN6 was similar to the time course of caspases and PARP cleavage, strongly suggesting that cleavage of CSN6 is dependent on the onset of apoptosis and is likely to be mediated by caspases (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that activation of caspases is required for cleavage and degradation of CSN6. To determine whether CSN6 cleavage is limited to SK-BR3 cells, we examined other cell types undergoing apoptosis in response to γTriDAP, TNFα, or a combination of the two agonists. Cleavage of CSN6 was observed in MCF-7 cells treated with γTriDAP in the presence of CHX (Fig. 3A) as well as in HT-29 cells and primary MEFs treated with TNFα (Fig. 3, B and C). The pattern of CSN6 cleavage observed in all cell lines was identical. We recently reported that the combination of γTriDAP or MDP with IFNγ induced extensive cell death in MCF-7 cells stably expressing Nod1 or Nod2, respectively (31da Silva Correia J. Miranda Y. Leonard N. Hsu J. Ulevitch R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed cleavage of CSN6 in MCF-7 Nod1 and MCF-7 Nod2 cells treated with γTriDAP/IFNγ or MDP/IFNγ. Fig. 3D shows that CSN6, but not CSN5, is cleaved in response to γTriDAP and MDP in the presence of IFNγ. Cleavage of two markers of apoptosis, PARP and caspase 8, was also observed in these conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CSN6 is the only subunit of the COP9 complex to undergo cleavage during Nod1-induced apoptosis. Since this also occurred when cells were treated with different apoptotic stimuli, CSN6 cleavage may reflect a specific mechanism of apoptosis. To further examine this possibility, we exposed SK-BR3 cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs known to induce apoptosis. This included staurosporine, etoposide, camptothecin, doxorubicin, curcumin, and taxol. CSN6 cleavage was evident in cells treated with camptothecin and doxorubicin but not when treated with other compounds (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, some of these compounds, such as staurosporine, etoposide, and curcumin, induced cell death in SK-BR3 cells but did not induce CSN6 cleavage. We also studied cleavage of PARP and caspases induced by these agents. Interestingly, CSN6 correlates with PARP and caspase activation induced by camptothecin and doxorubicin. Finally, we studied CSN6 cleavage in primary MEFs. As observed with human cell lines, CSN6 was cleaved in response to doxorubicin (Fig. 4B). These results show that CSN6 cleavage occurs in cell lines as well as in primary cell cultures. Furthermore, this effect can be reproduced in cells of mouse origin.FIGURE 4CSN6 cleavage is stimulus-dependent. A, SK-BR3 cells were stimulated with various chemotherapeutic drugs, such as staurosporine (500 nm), etoposide (100 μm), camptothecin (10 μm), doxorubicin (10 μm), curcumin (5 μm), or taxol (100 μm) for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using anti-CSN, anti-PARP, anti-caspase 3, and anti-caspase 8 antibodies. The numbers shown below the panels indicate the percentage of apoptotic cells as measured by PI staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. B, MEFs were stimulated as indicated for 24 h.

To ask whether CSN6 was a target of ubiquitin, we performed an in vivo ubiquitination assay using CSN6 as substrate. FLAG-CSN6 was co-transfected in 293 cells together with a vector encoding HA-ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 5, co-transfection of CSN6 and ubiquitin resulted in the appearance of a ladder indicating the presence of polyubiquitin CSN6 species. Co-transfection of CSN8 and ubiquitin did not result in CSN8 ubiquitination, since CSN8 could not be detected by anti-HA antibody and no ladder could be observed, suggesting the specificity of ubiquitination for CSN6. We next studied ubiquitination of endogenous CSN6 during apoptotic conditions. MCF-7 cells were treated with TNFα for different times in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Treatment of cells with MG-132 only allowed stabilization of ubiquitin"

https://openalex.org/W1983874820,"The RNase H activity of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) cleaves the viral genome concomitant with minus strand synthesis. We previously analyzed RT-mediated pausing and RNase H cleavage on a hairpin-containing RNA template system and reported that RT generated 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cuts while paused at the base of the hairpin during synthesis. Here, we report that all of the prominent cleavage products observed during primer extension on this template correlated with pause induced cuts. Products that persisted throughout the reaction corresponded to secondary cuts, about eight nucleotides in from the DNA primer terminus. This distance allows little overlap of intact template with the primer terminus. We considered whether secondary cuts could inactivate further synthesis by promoting dissociation of the primer from the template. As anticipated, 3′ end-directed secondary cuts decreased primer extendibility. This provides a plausible mechanism to explain the persistence of secondary cut products in our hairpin template system. Improving the efficiency of synthesis by increasing the concentration of dNTPs or addition of nucleocapsid protein (NC) reduced pausing and the generation of pause related secondary cuts on this template. Further studies reveal that 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cleavages were also generated when synthesis was stalled by the presence of 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine at the primer terminus, possibly contributing to 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine inhibition. Considered together, the data reveal a role for NC and other factors that enhance DNA synthesis in the prevention of RNase H cleavages that could be detrimental to viral replication.

Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) 3The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; RT, reverse transcriptase; AZT, 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; EIAV, equine infectious anemia virus; nt, nucleotide; EP, extension product; SP, self-priming product; NC, nucleocapsid protein. reverse transcriptase (RT) is the virally encoded enzyme responsible for conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome of HIV-1 to a double-stranded DNA form that can be integrated into the host genome (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). RT can utilize both RNA and DNA as a template for DNA synthesis. In addition, RT possesses RNase H activity, meaning that it can cleave RNA within a RNA:DNA hybrid. Both the polymerase and RNase H activities of RT are essential for the reverse transcription of the viral genome. RT is a p66/p51 heterodimer with both the polymerase and RNase H activities residing in the p66 subunit. When RT binds the primer terminus within the polymerase active site, the RNase H active site is positioned 18 nt upstream of the primer terminus (2Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Concomitant with synthesis of the first, or minus DNA strand, the polymerizing RT generates cuts on the RNA template ∼18 nt upstream, designated “polymerase-dependent” cuts. However, the polymerase and RNase H activities of RT are uncoupled and cuts occur less frequently than nucleotide incorporation (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in vitro indicate that RNase H cleavage by the polymerizing RT is not sufficient to fully degrade the RNA template and some fragments of RNA are left bound to the cDNA during minus strand synthesis (7DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7423-7431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that these fragments are degraded by excess RT in the virion through a “polymerase independent” mechanism. In support, RT has been shown to have alternate modes of nucleic acid binding that do not require a 3′ primer terminus. For example, RT preferentially cleaves ∼18 and ∼8 nt from the 5′ end of an RNA fragment recessed on a longer DNA substrate (8DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 9Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Designated as 5′ end-directed primary and secondary cuts, respectively, these ∼18 and ∼8 nt cuts are created independently of each other and at distinctly different rates (10Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the RT has been shown to make internal cuts that are not directed by primer termini (11Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These internal and 5′ end-directed RNase H cleavages by RT are believed to contribute to clearing away the RNA template during minus strand synthesis. Because of its critical role in the viral life cycle, RT is a drug target for treatment of HIV infection. Administration of nucleoside analogs, which are incorporated onto the elongating primer during viral replication but lack a 3′ hydroxyl group essential for further chain elongation, provides an efficient strategy to inhibit RT (12Emini E.A. Fan H.Y. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1997: 637-708Google Scholar). A widely used drug that employs this strategy is 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT). Following prolonged administration of AZT to patients, mutations that confer resistance arise (6Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Several studies point to a resistance mechanism involving RT-mediated removal of AZT-terminated primers (14Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 15Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RT was shown to excise an AZT residue from the primer terminus in the presence of an acceptor such as pyrophosphate (PPi) or ATP (14Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 17Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Moreover, compared with wild type RT, AZT-resistant RT is more efficient at ATP-mediated excision (16Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In vivo, reverse transcription takes place in the presence of virally encoded nucleocapsid protein (NC). NC has been shown to facilitate reverse transcription at multiple steps, including tRNA primer binding and removal, and minus and plus strand transfer (reviewed in Ref. 18Levin J.G. Guo J. Rouzina I. Musier-Forsyth K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 217-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). NC is a chaperone protein that promotes the folding of nucleic acids into more stable conformations and can enhance strand annealing (19Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 20Tsuchihashi Z. Brown P.O. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5863-5870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21You J.C.

Mounts P. Gorelick R.J. Casas-Finet J.R. Bosche W.J. Henderson L.E. Waters D.J. Arthur L.O. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Ji X.

Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pause sites are positions where RT synthesis is stalled, often by the presence of a secondary structure such as a hairpin. NC has also been suggested to influence the RNase H activity of RT. In several studies, NC was observed to increase overall RNase H cleavage during primer extension (26Chen Y. Balakrishnan M.

Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, NC has been shown to enhance secondary cleavages on blunt end substrates (29Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J.

Two of these strand transfer events are required at the ends of the genome for the completion of viral replication (1Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). In addition, RT has been shown to mediate strand transfer within internal regions of the genome (32Clavel F. Hoggan M.D. Willey R.L. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Repaske R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Goodrich D.W. Duesberg P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These events can produce recombinant progeny virus if the template regions involved in switching are not identical. By modeling template switching during minus strand synthesis in vitro, several mechanisms that promote strand transfer have been elucidated (reviewed in Ref. 35Negroni M. Buc H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). RNase H activity of RT is required for strand transfer in vitro (36DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J.

In addition, several groups have reported enhancement of strand transfer upon the addition of NC (29Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J.

However, templates with relatively less stable structures and less pausing also allow efficient strand transfer (45Balakrishnan M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

In this system, pausing at the base of the hairpin on the first, or donor, template enhances RNase H cleavage by the RT. This locally clears away the donor RNA and allows the second, or acceptor, template to interact with the cDNA before the hairpin base. The cDNA/acceptor hybrid propagates toward the cDNA primer 3′ terminus. Strand transfer is complete once the hybrid reaches the primer terminus and the acceptor serves as the template for DNA synthesis. Analysis of several other template systems provided further evidence that this multistep strand transfer mechanism that involves initial acceptor invasion upstream of the point of terminus transfer is a major pathway for strand transfer in HIV-1 (26Chen Y.

In a previous study examining RNase H mutants and strand transfer using the EIAV template, we identified prominent cleavages at the hairpin base of the EIAV RNA template generated during primer extension (49Purohit V.

We presented evidence indicating that they were created by a DNA 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cleavage mechanism mediated by RT while paused during synthesis. Because of their prominence in the degradation pattern of the donor template and their location at the hairpin base, we suggested that these 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cuts helped to create an acceptor invasion site for strand transfer. The generation of primary cuts at a pause site during synthesis was in agreement with the findings of Suo and Johnson (50Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12468-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Other studies also identified 3′ end-directed secondary cuts in the absence of synthesis (31Wisniewski M. Chen Y.

In the current study we further examined cleavages during primer extension on the EIAV template. We specifically addressed whether secondary cleavages made during synthesis lead to template disruption, and, if so, how the virus suppresses disruption to prevent inactivation of synthesis.

DNA oligonucleotides and RNA templates T2 and T3 were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). AZTTP was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Poly(rA)-oligo(dT) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. For 5′ end labeling, [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. NotI, HindIII, and Escherichia coli RNase H were purchased from Invitrogen. All other enzymes and dNTP solutions were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Preparation of Substrates—RNA template T1 (DI from pEIAV-Donor) was generated and purified as previously described (42Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

To prepare RNA templates for 5′ end labeling, RNA was first treated with calf alkaline phosphatase to remove the 5′ phosphate. RNA and DNA were radiolabeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled samples were purified using a Bio-Rad P-30 microbiospin column to remove unincorporated ATP. To anneal substrates for reactions, the templates were mixed in the appropriate ratio, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and then cooled slowly to room temperature. Primer Extension and Template Degradation with RNA T1—Reactions were performed as previously described (42Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

A labeled RNA template was used in reactions to monitor template degradation. For both types of reactions the substrates were annealed as described above in a ratio of 2:1 primer to template. The substrates were incubated with RT for 5 min at 37 °C prior to initiation of the reaction by the addition of MgCl2 and dNTPs. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and were terminated at appropriate times by the addition of 2× termination dye (20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide, 0.1% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanole). Unless otherwise specified, final reaction conditions were 4 nm primer, 2 nm template, 32 nm RT, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dNTPs, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. For primer extension control reactions, dCTP was replaced with ddCTP. To assess the amount of substrate available for RNase H cleavage in degradation assays, the substrate was incubated with 2 units of E. coli RNase H for 10 min. For reactions containing NC, 800% NC coating (expecting that 1 NC covers 7 nt) was added at 37 °C, 5 min prior to the addition of RT. The reaction products were separated by PAGE and visualized and quantitated by Storm PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software version 1.2 (GE Healthcare). The primers used were: P1, 5′-TACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′;O-A, 5′-ACACTATAGAATATGCATCACTAGTAAGCTTCAGGTATGGTCTGC-3′, O-B, 5′-GGTATGGTCTGCGGGCCTCTCA-3′; O-C, 5′-CGGGCCTCTCAGGTCCCTGTTC-3′; O-D, 5′-CCCTGTTCGGGCGCCAACTGTA-3′, O-E, 5′-GGATCTCGAACAGACAAACTAGAGACA-3′. Assay to Determine the Effect of RNase H Cleavage on Primer Extendibility—DNA primer P2 and RNA template T2, both radiolabeled, were annealed together in a 1:1 ratio. The substrate was incubated with RT for 5 min at 37 °C and then MgCl2 was added to initiate RT cleavage of the template. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and two aliquots were taken at appropriate times. To the aliquot identified as “quench” termination dye was added. To the other aliquot, identified as “extend,” dNTPs were added for an additional 5 min before addition of termination dye. The final reaction conditions were 4 nm primer, 4 nm template, 32 nm RT, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. The extend reactions contained 50 μm dNTPs. The reaction products were separated by PAGE and quantitated as described below. The primer extension control was performed under the same conditions as the other extend reactions, except without preincubation with MgCl2. The cleavage control was performed by the addition of 2 units of E. coli RNase H for 10 min. These controls were used to determine the maximum amount of substrate available for extension or cleavage. The percent of substrate that was extended or cleaved at each time point of the experiment was normalized to these control values. The substrates used were: P2, 5′-CTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAAT-3′ and T2, 5′-GGGCGAAUUCGAGCUCGGUACCCGGGGAUCCUCUAGAGUCG-3′. Assay to Determine the Ability of RT to Generate 3′ End-directed RNase H Cuts on an AZT-terminated Substrate—5′ End-labeled DNA primers P3 and P4 were annealed to 5′ end-labeled RNA template T3 at a ratio of 1 to 1. The substrates were incubated with RT for 5 min at 37 °C before initiation. Following initiation, the reactions were incubated at 37 °C and terminated at appropriate times by the addition of 2× termination dye. The final reaction conditions were 4 nm primer, 4 nm template, 32 nm RT, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Certain reactions contained 50 μm dNTPs, 3 mm ATP, and 100 μm PPi, as specified. For reactions with 3 mm ATP, an additional 3 mm MgCl2 was added. The reaction products were separated by PAGE and visualized and quantitated as described above. The templates used were: T3, 5′-GUAAACUUGAUCAGUCAGUACGUGGAAUGCUUAAUCAGUGAGGCCUAUCU-3′ and P3 and P4, 5′-GGCCTCACTGATTAAGCATTCCACGX-3′, where X is T or AZT, respectively. The P4 primer was generated as previously described (57Gotte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′ end-labeled VP52 was annealed to VP49 and incubated with RT and 50 μm dCTP, dATP, dGTP, and AZTTP. Extension of VP52 yielded P4, which was subsequently purified by PAGE. The templates used were: VP52, 5′-GCCCTCACTGATTAAGCATTCC-3′ and VP49, 5′-GTAAACTTGATCAGTCAGTACGTGGAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCCTATCT-3′. In a previous study we showed that during primer extension the RT created a series of prominent cleavages on the EIAV RNA template T1 before the base of the major hairpin in this substrate. The positioning of these cuts correlated with cuts produced by the RT in the absence of synthesis (no dNTPs) using a primer positioned at the base of the hairpin. Considered together, the data indicated that the RT generated 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cuts at this major pause site during primer extension. This study further defines the generation and consequences of the prominent cleavages created during primer extension on this template. Paused Intermediates of Primer Extension That Persisted Throughout the Reaction Correlated with Secondary Cuts at the Sites of Pausing—We wanted to determine whether all the prominent template cleavage bands observed during primer extension on the EIAV template T1 would correspond to pause related cuts. Fig. 1A shows the extension profile observed when synthesis on this template was monitored by use of a 5′ end-labeled primer. Extension of the P1 primer (22 nt) produced two completed products: extension product (EP) and self-priming product (SP). The extension product is 136 nt long and is generated by extension of the P1 primer to the end of the T1 template. The self-priming product is 194 nt long and is generated from a completed extension product that folds back onto itself and is extended an additional 58 nt using the remaining 5′ region of cDNA as a template for further synthesis (see schematic in Fig. 1A). After 1 min of extension, stalling of the RT at the base of the major hairpin produced a pause product at +58 (identified as A in the figure). At subsequent time points pausing at +68, +79, +93, and +120, identified as B, C, D, and E, respectively, were observed. Use of a 5′ end-labeled template instead of a labeled primer allowed for the monitoring of template cleavage during primer extension (see lanes labeled P1 in Fig. 1B). As the primer was extended, regions closer to the 5′ label became hybrid and available for RT-mediated RNase H cleavage. This explains the template cleavage pattern that was observed: cleavage fragments shifted from long products at early time points to shorter products at later time points. The prominent cleavage bands created during primer extension (positioned at +93, +83, +80, +75, +68, +60, +50, and +27) are labeled and indicated by circles to the left of the bands. In addition to these cleavage bands, prominent cleavage bands representing products less than 20 nt long were observed. Because these bands correspond to cuts at the 5′ terminus, they were not considered in our analysis of cuts during extension. To correlate pausing and cleavage, we designed a series of short DNA oligonucleotides (O-A, O-B, O-C, O-D, and O-E) complementary to the T1 RNA template with 3′ termini positioned at pause sites A, B, C, D, and E, respectively (+58, +68, +79, +93, and +120). When these oligonucleotides are annealed to the T1 RNA template, the resul"

Several compounds have been identified that antagonize the effects of cytokinins. Based on structural similarities and competitive inhibition, it has been assumed that these anticytokinins act through a common cellular target, namely the cytokinin receptor. Here, we examined directly the possibility that various representative classical anticytokinins inhibit the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors CRE1/AHK4 (cytokinin response 1/Arabidopsis histidine kinase 4) and AHK3 (Arabidopsis histidine kinase 3). We show that pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine and pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine anticytokinins do not act as competitors of cytokinins at the receptor level. Flow cytometry and microscopic analyses revealed that anticytokinins inhibit the cell cycle and cause disorganization of the microtubular cytoskeleton and apoptosis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that they inhibit regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) enzymes. Biochemical studies demonstrated inhibition by selected anti-cytokinins of both Arabidopsis and human CDKs. X-ray determination of the crystal structure of a human CDK2-anticytokinin complex demonstrated that the antagonist occupies the ATP-binding site of CDK2. Finally, treatment of human cancer cell lines with anticytokinins demonstrated their ability to kill human cells with similar effectiveness as known CDK inhibitors.

Cytokinins are plant hormones that play essential roles in the regulation of various aspects of plant growth and development (1Mok D-W. Mok M.-C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 89-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). They include a variety of chemicals with different degrees of structural similarity, some of which occur naturally in plants, and others that are known only as synthetic compounds. The natural cytokinins are adenine derivatives that can be classified according to the nature of their N6-side chain as either isoprenoid (zeatin) or aromatic (benzyladenine) cytokinins.Cytokinins are key regulators of the plant cell cycle, and the induction of cell division is considered diagnostic for this class of plant hormones. The molecular basis of this activity is only partially understood and may differ in different cell types. Cytokinins have been found to control tyrosine dephosphorylation and activation of p34cdc2-like H1 histone kinase (2Zhang K. Letham D-S. John P.-C. Planta. 1996; 200: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as well as the transcriptional activation of cyclin D3 (3Riou-Khamlichi C. Huntley R. Jacqmard A. Murray J.A.

AHK3, and CRE1/AHK4. All are membrane-located sensor histidine kinases with a predicted extracellular ligand-binding domain and cytoplasmic His kinase and receiver domains. It has been shown that the cytokinin signal is transmitted by a multistep phospho-relay system through a complex form of the two-component signaling pathway that has long been known in prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes. Among higher eukaryotes, the two-component signaling pathway is only found in plants (reviewed by Refs. 14Hwang I. Sheen J. Nature. 2001; 413: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 15Heyl A. Schmuölling T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 16Ferreira F-J.

Plant Hormone Signaling Annual Plant Reviews. 2006: 93-123Google Scholar).The development of agonists and antagonists of a particular physiological effect is useful in mechanism-of-action studies of biologically active natural products. The design of potential cytokinin antagonists has been based on the assumptions that 1) active cytokinins bind to one or more cellular receptor sites and 2) it should be possible to prepare compounds that have minimal cytokinin activity but retain sufficient structural similarity to the cytokinins to permit them to compete for available cytokinin receptor sites, thereby diminishing the biological activity of cytokinins. The potent naturally occurring cytokinin N6-isopentenyladenine served as the basis for initial structure-activity studies. Modification of the heterocyclic purine system yielded the first analogues with antagonistic activity that greatly reduced cytokinin activity in bioassays (18Skoog F. Armstrong D-J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1970; 21: 359-384Crossref Google Scholar, 19Skoog F. Hamzi Q-H. Szweykowska A.-M. Leonard N.-J. Carraway K.-L. Fujii T. Helgeson J.-P. Loeppky R.-N. Phytochemistry. 1967; 6: 1169-1192Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Consequently, a number of substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines, pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidines, s-triazines, N-benzyl-N′-phenylureas, and N-arylcarbamates were subsequently prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit cytokinin-promoted processes in various bioassays, and a number of them were identified as potential anticytokinins (reviewed by 20). Because of their structural similarity to natural cytokinins and because their antagonistic effects were reversible by increasing the cytokinin concentration, it was hypothesized that these compounds work through interaction with a common cellular target, viz the cytokinin receptor (20Iwamura H. Mok D.-W.-S. Mok M.-C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity and Function. 1994; (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL): 43-55Google Scholar). However, until recently, direct proof that cytokinin receptors are the sites of cytokinin-anticytokinin interactions was lacking because no cytokinin receptors had been identified. Recent advances in our understanding of cytokinin signaling motivated us to re-examine anticytokinin modes of action.Here we show that representative anticytokinins are not competitive inhibitors of two Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors. Furthermore, using mainly the potent anticytokinin 3-methyl-7-pentylaminopyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine (ANCYT1) as a representative example, we also show that anticytokinins inhibit cell cycle progression and cause cellular changes consistent with responses to known CDK inhibitors. We demonstrate CDK inhibition by anticytokinins in plants and humans and reveal the binding of ANCYT1 to the ATP-binding pocket of human CDK2. The observed activity of anticytokinins in human cancer cells makes them new candidates for drug research and development.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—trans-zeatin was obtained from Olchemim Ltd.

Mok D.-W.-S. Mok M.-C. Cytokinins: Chemistry, Activity and Function. 1994; (CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL): 43-55Google Scholar).We initially tested the activity of the compounds in the classical tobacco callus growth assay for cytokinins, using an experimental design similar to that described by Hecht (21Hecht S-M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2608-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and Skoog et al. (36Skoog F. Schmitz R-Y. Bock R.-M. Hecht S.-M. Phytochemistry. 1973; 12: 25-37Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Callus growth increased with increasing cytokinin (trans-zeatin) concentration, reaching a maximum at 0.5-1 μm (see supplemental Fig. S1). Growth was inhibited by increasing concentrations of anticytokinin, and ANCYT1 almost completely inhibited callus growth at a concentration of 10 μm (see supplemental Fig. S1).To investigate whether or not the growth inhibitory effect of anticytokinins results from the blocking of cytokinin receptors, we studied their interactions with the CRE1/AHK4 and AHK3 receptors of Arabidopsis. For this, we used E. coli reporter strains expressing single cytokinin receptors and the cytokinin-activated reporter gene cps::lacZ (10Suzuki T. Miwa K. Ishikawa K. Yamada H. Aiba H. Mizuno T.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Competitive inhibition of in vitro binding of trans-zeatin to CRE1/AHK4 and AHK3 by the proposed antagonists was investigated. After fractionation of E. coli cells, the presence of the CRE1/AHK4 and AHK3 proteins in isolated membranes, but not in the periplasm and cytoplasm fractions, was verified by equilibrium dialysis using [2-3H]zeatin (not shown). A competitive binding assay of the representative anticytokinins was then carried out, employing unlabeled trans-zeatin and adenine as positive and negative controls, respectively. Binding of radioactively labeled trans-zeatin to CRE1/AHK4 and AHK3 was inhibited competitively by unlabeled trans-zeatin (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, neither adenine nor any of the anticytokinins competed with trans-zeatin for receptor binding, even at 1,000-fold excess.To support our observation that representative anticytokinins do not compete with cytokinin for binding to the cytokinin receptors, we next determined whether the anticytokinins are able to block cytokinin primary signal transduction. ARR5 is a member of the type-A response regulators identified as cytokinin primary response genes (26D'Agostino I.B. Deruere J. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiology. 2000; 124: 1706-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We used transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings harboring the PARR5::GUS reporter (26D'Agostino I.B. Deruere J. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiology. 2000; 124: 1706-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 27Romanov G.A. Kieber J.J. Schmuölling T. FEBS. Lett. 2002; 515: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to test the effects of ANCYT1, ANCYT2, and ANCYT3 on induction of ARR5 triggered by the cytokinin benzyladenine. Data presented in Fig. 2E show that none of the anticytokinins was able to reduce the level of ARR5::GUS.The activity that is measured by most cytokinin bioassays is the induction of cell division. To explore the activity of anticytokinins on this process, we measured their inhibitory activity on the cell cycle directly, choosing ANCYT1 as a typical example. The effect of ANCYT1 on cell division was studied in Arabidopsis cell suspension cultures and V. faba root meristems. In several independent experiments, the MI was about 5-7% in the control Arabidopsis cells, whereas a significant decrease in MI to 1.5% was observed after treatment with 100 μm ANCYT1. No significant mitotic activity was detected in cells treated with a higher concentration (200 μm) of ANCYT1.In asynchronous root meristems of V. faba, the MI decreased from 8% in the control to 2% after a 12-h treatment with 400 μm ANCYT1. To characterize further the inhibitory effect of ANCYT1 on cell cycling, root meristem cells of V. faba were synchronized with hydroxyurea (HU). Synchronization of root meristems increased MI from 8 to 55% as counted 7 h after HU removal in control cells. ANCYT1 was applied immediately after HU removal. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the proportion of cells in G1 increased 10 h after release from the HU block in the untreated control, indicating that control cells progressed completely through mitosis (Fig. 3A); in contrast, a significantly larger proportion of the cells treated with 400 μm ANCYT1 still retained the G2/M DNA content at this time point (Fig. 3B). Together with the observed decrease in MI, these data indicate that ANCYT1 treatment inhibited the G2/M transition.FIGURE 3Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content in control and ANCYT1-treated cells. V. faba root meristem cells were synchronized with HU. ANCYT1 (400 μm) was applied immediately after HU removal, and 10 h later, the DNA content of both control cells (A) and ANCYT1-treated cells (B) was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Microscopic observation of both Arabidopsis and V. faba cells revealed that aberrant mitotic chromosome arrangements rather than regular metaphases were frequently present in mitotic cells that had been treated with ANCYT1. Immunofluorescent labeling of tubulin showed that abnormalities of cell cycle-specific arrays of microtubules were induced by ANCYT1 in Arabidopsis cells after treatment with a dose of 100 μm and were more pronounced at 200 μm (Fig. 4, A-F). Normal mitotic microtubule arrays typical of metaphase spindles, anaphase spindles, and cytokinetic apparatus phragmoplasts were observed in control Arabidopsis cells (Fig. 4, A-C, respectively). In contrast, ANCYT1-treated Arabidopsis cultures contained cells in pre-prophase, with microtubules randomly arranged in the nuclei and with highly condensed chromatin and persistent nuclear envelopes. These results are consistent with our observation that ANCYT1 blocked or delayed the G2/M transition (Fig. 4D). ANCYT1 also affected the organization of mitotic microtubules, causing a collapse of the microtubular cytoskeleton, accompanied by a strong affinity of the randomly arranged microtubules for chromatin and by the formation of irregular microtubule arrays, such as circles in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4E). The microtubules were also clustered randomly around newly forming daughter nuclei in telophase of ANCYT1-treated cells (Fig. 4F). Further significant cellular effects induced by ANCYT1 included apoptotic nuclear changes. Although in the control Arabidosis cells, only 1.5-2% of cells showed apoptotic DNA double strand breaks, up to 30% of the cells were apoptotic following a 3-h treatment with 50-100 μm ANCYT1 (Fig. 4, G and H). Similar changes in microtubule organization and induction of apoptosis were also observed after treatment of V. faba root meristems with ANCYT1 (not shown).FIGURE 4Changes at the cellular level after ANCYT1 treatment.

Doležel J. Heberle-Bors E. Strnad M. Boögre L. Plant J. 1998; 16: 697-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the influence of anticytokinins on CDK activity of a key plant cell cycle regulator, CDKA;1. CDKs were purified from an Arabidopsis suspension cell culture by two different methods, viz by immunoprecipitation with an anti-CDKA;1 antibody and by affinity chromatography with p13suc1-Sepharose. Fig. 5A shows that all three anticytokinins significantly inhibited phosphorylation of histone H1 by immunopurified CDKs of Arabidopsis at concentrations between 10 and 100 μm. However, ANCYT3 was less effective and showed inhibitory activity only at 100 μm (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, G2/M kinase CDKB1;1, immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, proved to be much less sensitive to roscovitine and ANCYT1 (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained with human CDKs, where mitotic CDK1 is less sensitive to roscovitine and ANCYT3 than CDK2 (see below and Ref. 38Schulze-Gahmen U. Brandsen J. Jones H-D.

https://openalex.org/W2034753964,"Many viruses have the ability to rapidly develop resistance against antiviral drugs and escape from the host immune system. To which extent the host environment affects this adaptive potential of viruses is largely unknown. Here we show that for HIV-1, the host-cell environment is key to the adaptive potential of the virus. We performed a large-scale selection experiment with two HIV-1 strains in two different T-cell lines (MT4 and C8166). Over 110 days of culture, both virus strains adapted rapidly to the MT4 T-cell line. In contrast, when cultured on the C8166 T-cell line, the same strains did not show any increase in fitness. By sequence analyses and infections with viruses expressing either yellow or cyan fluorescent protein, we were able to show that the absence of adaptation was linked to a lower recombination rate in the C8166 T-cell line. Our findings suggest that if we can manipulate the host-cellular factors that mediate viral evolution, we may be able to significantly retard viral adaptability."

The high affinity pathway (Reaction 1) is catalyzed by Acs (Ac-CoA synthetase; EC 6.2.1.1). Acetate+ATP↔Acetyl−AMP+PPi Acetyl−AMP+CoASH↔Ac−CoA+AMP(REACTION 1) The low affinity pathway is catalyzed by AckA (acetate kinase, EC 2.7.2.1) (Reaction 2), Acetate + ATP↔Ac−P+ADP(REACTION 2) where ΔG0′obs =-13 kJ/mol (1Thauer R.K.

Surveys of sequenced microbial genomes reveal two classes of Pta enzymes. Class I enzymes (PtaI) are ∼350 residues in length, whereas class II enzymes (PtaII) are twice as long as PtaI (∼700 residues) (26Brinsmade S.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1890-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Lundie Jr., L.L. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18392-18396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pduL gene of S. enterica was recently shown to encode an additional, evolutionarily distinct class of phosphotransacetylase enzymes (33Liu Y. Leal N.A. Sampson E.M. Johnson C.L. Havemann G.D. Bobik T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PtaI enzymes share end-to-end homology with the C-terminal domain of PtaII enzymes; hence, it is inferred that the active site of PtaII enzymes is located within their C-terminal domain. This assignment leaves open the question of what the function of the N-terminal domain of PtaII might be. Earlier biochemical characterizations of the Pta enzyme of Escherichia coli (a class II enzyme) showed that its forward Ac-CoA-forming activity was allosterically regulated by nucleotides, including ADP, ATP, and NADH (negative effectors), and by pyruvate (positive effector) (34Suzuki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 191: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These authors hypothesized that the N-terminal of the PtaII enzyme had a regulatory role. However, this idea was not pursued any further. We set out to investigate the function of the N-terminal domain of the PtaII enzyme of S. enterica (encoded by pta+). Our initial approach was genetic. A positive selection was used to isolate alleles of the pta gene that encoded variant proteins with improved catalytic properties. We isolated 10 single-amino acid variants, all of which had the mutation within the N-terminal domain of the protein. We report here the kinetic analysis of three variant Pta proteins and discuss the implications of these findings. All strains used in this study were derivatives of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT2 (hereafter referred to as S. enterica). The genotypes of bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in supplemental Table 4. S. enterica strains were grown in no-carbon essential minimal medium (35Berkowitz D. Hushon J.M. Whitfield H.J. Roth J. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 96: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with potassium acetate (10 mm), MgSO4 (1 mm), l-methionine (0.5 mm), and trace metals (36Atlas R. Handbook of Media for Environmental Microbiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 5Google Scholar). Nutrient broth (NB) (37Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 78-79Google Scholar) and lysogeny broth (LB) (38Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 1951; 62: 293-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bertani G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) were used as rich media to cultivate S. enterica and E. coli strains, respectively. Working concentrations of antibiotics were 100 μg/ml for ampicillin (Ap) and 20 μg/ml for tetracycline (Tc) in rich medium and 2 μg/ml for tetracycline in minimal medium. Growth behavior was analyzed using a 96-well microtiter dish (BD Biosciences) format using a computer-controlled Ultra Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) equipped with the KC4 software package. The temperature of the incubation chamber was set at 37 °C. Each well of the plate contained 195 μl of fresh minimal medium supplemented with 10 mm potassium acetate, pH 7. Each well was inoculated with 5 μl of a culture of S. enterica grown in NB medium for ∼24 h. Growth was monitored as the increase in the optical density at 650 nm (OD650). Cultures were shaken for 870 s between readings, pausing for 10 s before each reading. Each experiment consisted of seven replicates per strain, and the experiment was performed at least four times from four independent sets of cultures to ensure reproducibility and statistical significance. All P22-mediated transduction crosses were performed using established protocols (37Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 78-79Google Scholar) using phage P22 HT105/1 int-210 (40Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1971; 100: 378-381Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 41Schmieger H. Bakhaus H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transductants were freed of phage as described (42Chan R.K. Botstein D. Watanabe T. Ogata Y. Virology. 1972; 50: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Localized mutagenesis (43Hong J.-S. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3158-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was performed to isolate chromosomal pta alleles encoding variant Pta proteins that would support growth on 10 mm acetate. Briefly, phage was propagated on strain JE7807, which harbored a mini-Tn10 element (44Way J.C. Davis M.A. Morisato D. Roberts D.E. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) in an open reading frame proximal to pta (i.e. open reading frame stm2340). Phage P22 was concentrated by centrifugation at 39,191 × g for 2 h at 4 °C using a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-25I centrifuge equipped with a JA-25.50 rotor. Hydroxylamine mutagenesis of the phage was monitored by a plaque assay (37Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. A Manual for Genetic Engineering: Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, pp. , Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 78-79Google Scholar) using strain TR6583 as an indicator strain. Recipient strain JE4312 (Δacs) was transduced to TcR using mutagenized phage as donor. TcR recombinants were replica-printed onto minimal medium plates containing 10 mm acetate as the sole source of carbon and energy, tetracycline, and the calcium chelator EGTA. TcR recombinants that grew on 10 mm acetate were purified on the selective minimal medium and reconstructed using P22 phage grown on them as donor and strain JE4312 as recipient. Strains carrying pta alleles encoding Pta variants capable of supporting growth on low acetate (10 mm) were grown overnight in 2 ml of NB. A 10-1 dilution of cells was boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 min at 18,000 × g in a Microfuge® 18 centrifuge (Beckman-Coulter). The resulting DNA preparation was used as template during PCR amplification using forward primer 5′-TGTAACCCGGGCCCAAAAGACTGTAACGA-3′, reverse primer 5′-TCACCTCTAGACCTGACAAGGCGTTCAC-3′, TripleMaster polymerase (Eppendorf). The resulting 2.2-kb fragment was purified using a QiaQuick® gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and was used as template for DNA sequencing using nonradioactive Big-Dye® (ABI PRISM) protocols (University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center). Primers used to generate site-directed mutant alleles are shown in supplemental Table 5. The Internet-based program PrimerX (available on the World Wide Web at bioinformatics.org/primerx/) was used to help design mutagenic primers. Plasmid pPTA21—Allele pta+ from S. enterica was amplified from strain TR6583 using the forward primer 5′-TGTAACCCGGGCCCAAAAGACTGTAACGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCACCTCTAGACCTGACAAGGCGTTCAC-3′. The underlined bases denote the engineered 5′ SmaI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The 2.2-kb DNA fragment was bluntended, phosphorylated, and ligated into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of plasmid pCC1 (Epicenter). The presence and orientation of the insert (opposing the PT7 promoter) was verified by restriction analysis. This plasmid (named pPTA3) was cut with restriction enzymes SmaI and XbaI. The released pta+ fragment was extracted from the gel and ligated into the same sites of plasmid pBAD30 (45Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pPTA11. The sequence encoding N-terminal domain amino residues 1–401 was amplified from pPTA11 using the forward primer 5′-GAGGATAAACCATGGCCCGTATTATTATGCTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTTCCCGGGTTTACGCGCCAGCTCAGTCA-3′. Underlined bases denote the engineered 5′ NcoI and 3′ SmaI restriction sites, respectively. Construction of the 5′ NcoI site incorporated the amino acid substitution S2A. The 1.1-kb DNA fragment was A-tailed with Vent (exo-) (New England Biolabs), gel-extracted, and ligated into the MCS of pGEM-T-Easy (Promega). The presence of the insert was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis, and this plasmid was named pPTA19. The 1.1-kb DNA containing the Pta N-terminal domain coding sequence was released from pPTA19 using NcoI and SmaI. Following gel extraction, the fragment was ligated into the same restriction sites of cloning vector pTYB4 (New England Biolabs). The resulting plasmid encoded the N-terminal 401 amino acid residues of Pta fused to a chitin binding domain tag at the C terminus of the protein. We used restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing to verify that the plasmid was constructed correctly. The resulting plasmid was 8.6 kb long and was named pPTA21. Plasmid pPTA69—The pta+ gene was amplified from pPTA11 using the forward primer 5′-GTAACGAAAGAGGAGCTAGCATGTCCCGTA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCACCTCTAGACCTGACAAGGCGTTCAC-3′. The underlined bases denote the engineered 5′ NheI and 3′ XbaI restriction sites, respectively. The 2.2-kb DNA fragment was A-tailed with Vent (exo-), gel-extracted, and ligated into the MCS of plasmid pGEM-T-Easy, opposite to the direction of transcription of PlacZ. This 2.2-kb pta+ DNA fragment was released by cutting with restriction enzyme NheI and was ligated into the same dephosphorylated site of plasmid pKLD37. The resulting plasmid encoded a Pta protein fused to a recombinant tobacco etch virus (rTEV)-protease-cleavable His6 tag at the N terminus of the protein. Restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing were used to verify the orientation of pta+. The resulting plasmid was 7.7-kb long and was named pPTA69. Plasmids pPTA73-75 and pPTA83-84—Plasmid pPTA69 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® XL kit (Stratagene) to construct allele pta105 encoding variant protein PtaG273D (plasmid pPTA73), allele pta104 encoding variant PtaM294I (plasmid pPTA74), allele pta106 encoding variant PtaR252H (plasmid pPTA75), allele pta107 encoding PtaG31D (plasmid pPTA83), and allele pta108 encoding PtaR113H (plasmid pPTA84); all plasmids were 7.7 kb long. The presence of the mutations was individually verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were visualized after SDS-PAGE (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar) and Coomassie Blue staining (47Sasse J. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1991: 10.6.1-10.6.3Google Scholar). Protein quantification was performed using the method of Bradford (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by band densitometry using a computer-controlled Fotodyne imaging system with Foto/Analyst version 5.00 software (Fotodyne Incorporated) for image acquisition and TotalLab version 2005 software for analysis (Nonlinear Dynamics). Reported activities were adjusted to reflect enzyme purity. Overproduction and Purification of Recombinant His6-Pta Proteins—E. coli strain BL21(λDE3) was used as the overexpression strain. Following transformation of E. coli strain BL21(λDE3) with the appropriate plasmid, a 5-ml culture was grown overnight at 30 °C and was used to inoculate 500 ml (1:100, v/v) of LB supplemented with ampicillin. Cultures were grown to an OD650 of ∼0.6–0.8 and placed on ice for at least 10 min. pta gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (250 μm), followed by overnight incubation (∼16 h) at 30 °C with shaking (∼175 rpm). Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 7,354 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman-Coulter Avanti J25-I centrifuge equipped with a JA-25.50 rotor. Cell pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of cold His-Bind buffer (buffer A) (Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.9, at 4 °C) containing NaCl (500 mm), imidazole (5 mm), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)) and passed thrice through a chilled French pressure cell at 1.05 × 106 kilopascals. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 39,191 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Wild-type and variant Pta proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography on His-Bind Quick 900 cartridges (Novagen). Cartridges were equilibrated and developed with ice-cold buffers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target proteins were first dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer B (Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 4 °C) containing NaCl (200 mm) and EDTA (10 mm)) for 2 h, followed by an overnight dialysis against buffer C (Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5, at 4 °C) containing NaCl (200 mm) and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and a second 2-h dialysis against buffer C. Dialyzed proteins were flash-frozen into liquid nitrogen in ∼50-μl pellets. Proteins were stored at -80 °C until used. The average purity of protein preparations was ∼70%. When necessary, protein production was scaled up to 8-liter cultures. Cell paste was resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A, cells were broken by French pressing, and cell extracts were manipulated as above except that extracts were loaded onto a His-TrapFF 5-ml column connected to a computer-controlled ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system. Unbound proteins were eluted off of the column after extensive washing with buffer A (≥50 ml). A 30-ml wash with 94% buffer A and 6% buffer D (Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.9, at 4 °C) containing NaCl (500 mm) and imidazole (1 m)) was applied to the column prior to application of a 50-ml linear gradient (6–100%) of buffer D. A single protein peak containing His6-Pta protein was recorded at ∼25% buffer D. Fractions containing His6-Pta were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B (containing 250 mm NaCl) for 2 h. Samples were dialyzed overnight (∼16 h), and again for 2 h against buffer C (containing 250 mm NaCl). The concentration of protein was determined before freezing and storage at -80 °C. Protein purity was ≥90%. Cleavage of the Hexahistidine Tag of His6-Pta Proteins by rTEV Protease—We used rTEV protease isolated in house (>60% homogeneity; data not shown) as described elsewhere (see, on the World Wide Web, www.cf.ac.uk/biosi/staff/ehrmann/tools/TEVprot.html). Extended incubation of His6-Pta proteins with rTEV protease (2 days at 4 °C) was needed to remove the His6 tag of 40% of the Pta proteins. After elution of His6-Pta proteins from the affinity column, they were mixed with rTEV (1:50 rTEV:His6-Pta (w/w)) and extensively dialyzed, first against buffer E (Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0, at 4 °C) containing NaCl (250 mm) and EDTA (10 mm)) for 2 h, followed by a 4-h dialysis against buffer F (buffer E containing EDTA at 0.5 mm). His6-Pta/rTEV mixtures were further dialyzed overnight against buffer G (buffer F plus dithiothreitol (3 mm)). Dialysis was then performed using buffer H (Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8.0, at 4 °C) containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and dithiothreitol (2 mm) for 8 h, with a second overnight dialysis against the same buffer. After cleavage, the protein mixtures were dialyzed into buffer A and passed over the His-Trap FF 5-ml column following the protocol described above. Protein that did not bind to the column was analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing Pta protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer B (containing 250 mm NaCl). A second dialysis was performed twice against buffer C (containing 250 mm NaCl) for at least 2 h each. Tagless Pta protein was quantified via Bradford assay, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until used. Overproduction and Purification of the N-terminal Domain of S. enterica PtaII Enzyme—The N-terminal domain of the S. enterica PtaII enzyme (residues 1–401) was overproduced in E. coli strain BL21(λDE3) and purified using the IMPACT® system (New England Biolabs). After transforming plasmid pPTA21 pta+ into the host, a single colony was used to inoculate 10 ml of LB broth supplemented with Ap and grown overnight at 30 °C. The culture was subcultured 1:100 (v/v) into 1 liter of LB supplemented with Ap. Cultures were grown to an OD650 of ∼0.6–0.8 and placed on ice for 10 min. pta gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (250 μm), followed by overnight incubation (∼16 h) at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,543 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman-Coulter Avanti J-20 XPI centrifuge equipped with a JLA-8.100 rotor. The cell pellet was resuspended in 35 ml of cold buffer I (HEPES (20 mm, pH 7.9, at 4 °C) containing NaCl (500 mm), EDTA (1 mm)) and passed three times through a chilled French pressure cell at 1.05 × 106 kilopascals. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 39,191 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Extract was loaded onto a chitin column (20-ml bed volume) equilibrated with buffer I and developed according to the manufacturer's instructions with a flow rate of 200 ml h-1. Overnight, on-column cleavage of the tag was achieved with dl-dithiothreitol (dithiothreitol, 50 mm). Fractions containing Pta N-terminal domain purified to >97% homogeneity (data not shown) were pooled and dialyzed against buffer I lacking EDTA and at pH 7.5 (4 °C) overnight. Protein was dialyzed extensively against buffer J (Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.5, at 4 °C) containing 10% glycerol (v/v)). Protein was quantified and flash-frozen as ∼50-μl drops in liquid nitrogen before storage at -80 °C. Polyclonal antibodies were elicited by subcutaneous injection of 270 μg of purified N-terminal domain as primary antigen into a New Zealand White female rabbit (Laboratory Animal Resources, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Subsequent antigen boosts were performed with ∼250 μgof protein. Western blots were performed using standard protocols (49Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.G.R. Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E.

Signal was detected using the SuperSignal® West Dura trial chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) and a computer-controlled Cyclone phosphor imager furnished with OptiQuant version 4.00 imaging software (Packard Instruments). Pta in vitro activity assays of the forward reaction (Reaction 3, Ac-CoA-forming direction) were performed by monitoring the formation of the thioester bond as the increase in absorbance at 233 nm. The amount of product formed was quantified using the extinction coefficient (ϵ) of 5.55 mm-1 cm-1 (26Brinsmade S.R. Escalante-Semerena J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 1890-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32Lundie Jr., L.L. Ferry J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18392-18396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only modification to the reported protocol was the final volume of the reaction mixture, which was increased to 1 ml; dithiothreitol was not required for Pta activity. Assays of the back reaction (Reaction 3, Ac-P-forming direction) monitored the release of free CoASH as the increase in absorbance at 412 nm observed when the thiolate anion of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (ϵ412 = 13,600 m-1 cm-1) was formed upon reaction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and the sulfhydryl group of CoA (50Habeeb A.F.S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2154915219,"The FK506-binding proteins (FKBs) represent ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze the rate-limiting peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerization step in protein folding. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has eight FKBs, three of which (FKB-3, -4, and -5) have dual peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domains, signal peptides and ER retention signals. PPIase activity has been detected for recombinant FKB-3. Both FKB-3 and -5 are expressed in the exoskeleton-synthesizing hypodermis with transcript peaks that correspond to the molting and collagen synthesis cycles. FKB-4 is expressed at a low level throughout development. No phenotypes were observed in deletion mutants in each of the secretory pathway FKBs. Combined triple and fkb-4, -5 double deletion mutants were however found to arrest at 12 degrees C, but developed normally at 15-25 degrees C. This cold-sensitive larval lethal effect was not maternally derived, occurred during embryogenesis, and could be rescued following the transgenic introduction of a wild type copy of either fkb-4 or fkb-5. The temperature-sensitive defects also affected molting, cuticle collagen expression, hypodermal seam cell morphology, and the structural integrity of the cuticular extracellular matrix. This study establishes that the secretory pathway FK506-binding PPIase enzymes are essential for normal nematode development, collagen biogenesis, and the formation of an intact exoskeleton under adverse physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1999215126,"Toxic compounds such as carcinogens are removed from the body by the action of a series of detoxifying enzymes and transporters expressed in the liver and the small intestine. We have found that intestinal epithelial cells expressing the SV40 large T antigen (TAg) contain significantly lower levels of mRNAs, encoding several drug metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes and transporters compared to their non-transgenic littermates. In addition, TAg blocks the induction of these mRNAs by xenobiotics. The repression depends on an intact LXCXE motif in TAg, suggesting that inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family of tumor suppressors plays a role in the process. These results imply that a functional Rb pathway in the intestine is necessary for the expression of the detoxification system used to clear carcinogens, and suggest that loss of this tumor suppressor might alter susceptibility to chemical injury. In addition, the effect of TAg on the detoxification pathway appears to be tissue-specific, as its ectopic expression in the liver failed to suppress the P450 enzymes. The TAg-mediated suppression of drug metabolizing/detoxifying enzymes may have broad implications in the metabolism and mechanism of action of both carcinogens and prescription drugs."
