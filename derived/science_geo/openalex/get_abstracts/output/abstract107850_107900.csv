https://openalex.org/W1517251498,"The tumor suppressor p53 is a potent transcriptional activator that has been shown to regulate its own expression. In earlier studies, deletion analysis and site-specific mutagenesis identified the p53-responsive element that fits the p53 consensus sequence. In addition, the p53-responsive element was predicted to be a binding site for NF-kappa B. In this study, we showed that NF-kappa B present in HeLa nuclear extracts could bind the same DNA element in a sequence-specific manner. Co-transfection experiments showed that the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, but not the p50 subunit, could activate the p53 promoter. In HeLa cells, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced NF-kappa B activity. The p53 promoter was also induced by TNF-alpha under the same conditions. Both p65 transactivation and TNF-alpha induction of the p53 promoter depended on an intact NF-kappa B site. Detailed mutational analysis of the p53 and NF-kappa B responsive elements allowed differentiation of these two responses. Thus, we show that NF-kappa B activates p53 and that this activation is inducible by TNF-alpha. Since NF-kappa B induction occurs as a response to stress and p53 arrests cells in G1/S, where repair may be initiated, activation of p53 by NF-kappa B could be a mechanism by which cells can recover from stress."
https://openalex.org/W1550566612,"Transposon Tn5-GM-induced mutant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which are unable to produce rhamnolipid biosurfactants and lack rhamnosyltransferase activity have been isolated. The DNA regions flanking the transposon were cloned and used as specific probes for the isolation of the corresponding wild-type genes from a P. aeruginosa wild-type cosmid gene library. Single cosmid clones capable of restoring rhamnolipid synthesis in the mutant strains were isolated and further subcloned and sequenced, resulting in the identification of two genes (rhlAB) which are organized as an operon upstream of the previously identified rhlR regulatory gene. The RhlA protein (32.5 kDa) harbors a putative signal sequence, suggesting that this protein is located in the periplasm, while the RhlB protein (47 kDa) contains at least two putative membrane-spanning domains. The expression of the rhlAB genes was found to be enhanced 20-fold during the stationary phase of growth under conditions of nitrogen limitation, as measured by using rhlA::lacZ fusions. Moreover, the transcriptional activation of the rhlAB genes appears to depend on a functional RhlR regulatory protein. The sequence upstream of the rhlA promoter contains two inverted repeats which define putative binding sites for the RhlR regulator. The controlled expression of the rhlAB genes in Escherichia coli led to the formation of active rhamnosyltransferase. This provides direct evidence for the fact that the rhamnosyltransferase encoding genes have been identified."

To determine the stoichiometry of this complex we used analysis by affinity labeling with 125I-TGF-beta 1 and covalent cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate and immunoprecipitation using T beta R-I- or T beta R-II-specific antisera, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under nonreducing (first dimension) and reducing (second dimension) conditions. Dimers composed of T beta R-I and/or T beta R-II were observed on mink lung epithelial cells as well as COS-1 cells transfected with T beta R-I and T beta R-II cDNAs. Homodimers of T beta R-I could be demonstrated on these cells after dissociation of T beta R-II by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. On the cell surface of mink lung epithelial cell mutants that express only T beta R-II and do not respond to TGF-beta, and on COS-1 cells transfected with only T beta R-II, only homodimers of T beta R-II were seen. The facts that T beta R-I does not bind TGF-beta in the absence of T beta R-II and that T beta R-II forms a signaling complex with T beta R-I, together with our observations that homodimers of T beta R-I and T beta R-II are seen on responsive cells, support the notion that TGF-beta induces the formation of hetero-oligomeric receptor complexes, most likely a heterotetramer containing two molecules each of T beta R-I and T beta R-II."
https://openalex.org/W1595716544,"Since heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family and binds to EGF receptor, we tested recombinant HB-EGF for its ability to stimulate human keratinocyte proliferation. The effect of HB-EGF on human keratinocytes was dependent on the cell density. HB-EGF optimally increased the cell number by 1.8-fold at 1.0 ng/ml for a 4-day incubation period under subconfluent culture. In contrast, under confluent culture, 10 ng/ml HB-EGF optimally increased the DNA synthesis 2.1-fold. To examine the production of HB-EGF by human keratinocytes, the analysis of human keratinocyte-conditioned medium was undertaken by a combination of heparin affinity column chromatography, EGF receptor-stimulating assay, immunoblotting, and neutralization. Heparin column chromatography fractionated three activities, peaks 1, 2, and 3, which contained immunoreactive 30- and 27-, 19-, and 14.5-kDa bands, respectively. The anti-HB-EGF-blocking antibody neutralized the activities of peaks 2 and 3 by 38 and 22%, respectively, but did not neutralize the activity of peak 1 at all. The antibody reduced the cell growth by 37% for a 4-day incubation period. Northern blot analysis detected a 2.5-kilobase transcript of HB-EGF. The addition of 1 ng/ml HB-EGF optimally increased the levels of HB-EGF mRNA 5.4-fold at 1 h and TGF-alpha mRNA 3.1-fold at 3 h. Interestingly, the addition of TGF-alpha at 1 ng/ml to keratinocyte cultures enhanced the level of HB-EGF mRNA 10.2-fold at 6 h. 1 ng/ml EGF also increased HB-EGF mRNA levels 10.9-fold at 1 h. These results suggest that HB-EGF is an autocrine growth factor for human keratinocytes, and HB-EGF and TGF-alpha act not only by an autoinductive mechanism but also by mutual amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1543736549,"Before cells can invade the extracellular matrix, they must alter their expression of adhesion receptors. Syndecan-1 is a cell surface proteoglycan that binds cells to matrix and undergoes changes in expression during development, during differentiation of some cell types, and following malignant transformation in some tumors. To determine if changes in syndecan-1 expression influence cell invasion, we employed a model system in which human B lymphoid cells invade type I collagen gels. Examination of a panel of cell lines reveals that those lines not expressing syndecan-1 invade and migrate within collagen. In contrast, cell lines expressing syndecan-1 fail to invade. To directly assess the effect of syndecan-1 on invasion, ARH-77 cells, which do not express syndecan-1 and readily invade collagen, were transfected with a cDNA for syndecan-1. The syndecan-1-positive transfectants exhibit a drastically reduced ability to invade as compared to parental cells. This inhibition of invasion by syndecan-1 is reversed by preincubating gels with heparin or by growing cells in chlorate, an inhibitor of glycosaminoglycan sulfation. These results demonstrate that expression of syndecan-1 inhibits cell invasion into collagen and that loss of syndecan-1 expression may be necessary prior to the migration of normal or metastatic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1771723362,"The transcription of the ars operon is negatively controlled by the ArsR repressor and induced by arsenite and antimonite. Using hydroxylamine mutagenesis, four arsR mutants were isolated; three were selected for inability to respond to inducers: C32Y, C32F, and C34Y. Each of the three altered proteins still bound specifically to the ars operator, but inducers were less effective in effecting the release of the altered proteins from the DNA. Each of the mutant arsR genes in trans with a reporter gene controlled by the ars promoter repressed expression of the reporter gene, and addition of inducer did not relieve repression. These results suggest that the altered ArsR proteins are defective in the inducer binding site. The fourth arsR mutation, resulting in a H50Y alteration, produced constitutive expression. His-50 is located within a putative helix-turn-helix region of the ArsR protein. We propose that cysteines Cys-32 and Cys-34 in the ArsR protein comprise part of a metal binding motif found in members of the ArsR family of metalloregulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1507620414,"To identify the binding domain for brevetoxins, a family of lipid-soluble neurotoxins acting at Na+ channel receptor site 5, purified and reconstituted rat brain Na+ channels were photolabeled with p-azidobenzoyl tritium-labeled brevetoxin, and the labeled peptides were identified. A radiolabeled band with an apparent molecular mass of 250 kDa corresponding to the Na+ channel alpha-subunit was revealed using both gel slicing and fluorography techniques. Regions of the alpha-subunit specifically photolabeled by this ligand were then identified by antibody mapping of proteolytic fragments. Even after extensive proteolysis, anti-peptide antibodies recognizing amino acid sequences within or adjacent to Na+ channel transmembrane segments IS6 and IVS5 were each able to immunoprecipitate up to 40% of the labeled peptides. A more extensive tryptic digest was obtained with a preparation in which the brevetoxin photolabel was incorporated into the alpha-subunit of purified Na+ channel in detergent solution. The identification of a specifically immunoprecipitated 6-kDa peptide containing transmembrane segment S6 from domain I restricted the labeled peptide fragment to residues Thr-400 to Lys-443 if tryptic digestion was complete or Ala-396 to Lys-455 if tryptic cleavage was incomplete. Similarly, the identification of a specifically immunoprecipitated 6-kDa peptide from domain IV restricted the labeled peptide to residues Glu-1738 to Lys-1785 or Glu-1738 to Lys-1793 on the extracellular side of transmembrane segment S5. These results provide direct evidence for close association of transmembrane segments IS6 and IVS5 in the native conformation of the Na+ channel alpha-subunit and implicate their region of interaction as an important component of the brevetoxin receptor site."
https://openalex.org/W1591746786,"The photoreceptor G-protein, transducin, belongs to the class of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins that transfer information from activated seven-span membrane receptors to effector enzymes or ion channels. Like other G-proteins, transducin acts as a molecular clock. It is activated by photoexcited rhodopsin which catalyzes the exchange of transducin-bound GDP for GTP and then stays active until bound GTP is hydrolyzed by an intrinsic GTPase activity. Our previous study on the components of the amphibian phototransduction cascade (Arshavsky, V. Y., and Bownds, M. D. (1992) Nature 357, 416-417) has shown that transducin GTPase can be significantly accelerated by the target enzyme, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE), and more specifically its gamma-subunit (PDE gamma). Here we report that an analogous mechanism is present in bovine photoreceptors. Addition of recombinant PDE gamma to the test photoreceptor membranes which retain transducin but are depleted of endogenous PDE causes a significant acceleration of transducin GTPase activity. A similar effect was observed with the PDE holoenzyme, but not with the complex of PDE alpha- and beta-subunits prepared by a limited proteolysis of PDE with trypsin. The activating effect of PDE gamma is increased as test membrane concentration increases, exceeding 20-fold at rhodopsin concentrations over 80 microM and approaching the rate of the photoresponse turnoff. This suggests either that photoreceptor membranes contain a further factor which is essential for PDE-dependent regulation of transducin-bound GTP hydrolysis or that components of the phototransduction cascade interact in a cooperative manner. We also report that the GTPase-activating epitope is located within the C-terminal third of PDE gamma: the peptide corresponding to the 25 C-terminal amino acid residues of PDE gamma can accelerate transducin GTPase almost as well as the full-length PDE gamma. A part of the GTPase activating epitope is located within the 3 C-terminal amino acid residues: the truncation PDE gamma mutant lacking these residues accelerates transducin GTPase considerably less than the whole length PDE gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1607633625,"Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHS)-1 and -2 are integral membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The luminal versus cytoplasmic orientations of several epitopes of PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 were determined by immunocytofluorescent staining of cells following treatment with membrane-selective permeants. With serum-stimulated, murine NIH/3T3 cells expressing PGHS-2, an anti-peptide antibody directed against a domain near the COOH terminus of this isozyme caused staining only after all membranes were permeabilized with 0.2% saponin; no staining occurred with 3T3 cells treated with digitonin to permeabilize only the plasma membrane. Similarly, cos-1 cells expressing ovine PGHS-1 were stained with anti-peptide antibodies directed against (a) the amino terminus (residues 25-35), (b) a domain containing the tryptic cleavage site at Arg277 (residues 272-284), or (c) a region near the carboxyl terminus (residues 583-594) following permeabilization with saponin but not with digitonin or streptolysin O. The results obtained with the antibodies against the Arg277-containing domain of PGHS-1 were surprising because the enzyme is susceptible to tryptic cleavage at Arg277 in microsomal preparations. However, enzymatic and immunochemical analyses of microsomes prepared from ovine vesicular glands and cos-1 cells indicated that these microsomes are not intact. Accordingly, our results indicate that the trypsin cleavage site (Arg277) as well as the NH2 and COOH termini of ovine PGHS-1 are on the luminal side of the ER. The NH2 terminus, the Arg277 domain, and the N-glycosylation sites of ovine PGHS-1 are part of a large soluble, globular structure in crystalline ovine PGHS-1 (Picot, D., Loll, P. J., and Garavito, M. (1994) Nature, 367, 243-249). We conclude that PGHS-1 and, by analogy, the highly homologous PGHS-2 are luminal ER proteins. Assuming that the PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 present in the ER are functional in intact cells, our results indicate that PGH2 synthesis from arachidonate occurs in the lumen of the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1524778875,"Prostacyclin synthase catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostacyclin, which is a powerful vasodilator and the most potent natural occurring inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In the present study, we determined the amino acid sequence of bovine prostacyclin synthase by combined protein chemical and molecular cloning techniques. The enzyme was purified and characterized from bovine aorta microsomes, and the partial amino acid sequences were determined with the native enzyme and endoproteinase Lys-C-cleaved peptides. Using primers synthesized according to the amino acid sequences, cDNA coding for prostacyclin synthase was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with bovine endothelial cell poly(A)+ RNA and cloned into pBluescript II. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the cloned cDNA inserts revealed that cDNA for this enzyme contained a 1500-base pair open reading frame coding for a 500-amino acid polypeptide with a M(r) of 56,628. COS-7 cells transfected with an expression plasmid harboring this cDNA clone expressed prostacyclin synthase activity. The primary structure of the enzyme showed structural characteristics of cytochrome P450 and exhibited a 32% identity to that of human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. However, the identity between the amino acid sequences of bovine prostacyclin synthase and human thromboxane synthase was only 16%, and no P450 showed an identity higher than 40%, suggesting that prostacyclin synthase represents a new family in the P450 superfamily. RNA blot analysis indicated that the mRNA for prostacyclin synthase from bovine endothelial cells showed a size of approximately 2.7 kilobases and that the mRNA level increased about 3-fold by treatment of tumor necrosis factor-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1555294060,"Factor VIII functions as an essential cofactor in the blood coagulation cascade for the factor IXa-mediated activation of factor X. Factor VIII contains 6 tyrosine residues at positions 346, 718, 719, 723, 1664, and 1680 that are modified by post-translational sulfation. This modification is required for full factor VIII procoagulant activity. We have employed site-directed mutagenesis to identify the individual sulfated tyrosines within factor VIII that influence activity. The molecules were expressed in COS-1 monkey cells by transient transfection, and the resultant proteins were characterized. Metabolic incorporation of [35S]sulfate demonstrated that all 6 tyrosine residues are sulfated in factor VIII. Sulfation at residues 346 and 1664 was required for full activity in a factor VIII clotting assay but did not affect factor VIII activity monitored by a factor Xa generation assay. The Tyr346-->Phe and Tyr1664-->Phe mutants displayed delayed thrombin activation that correlated with delayed cleavage at residues 372 and 1689, respectively. In contrast, these mutants were efficiently activated by factor Xa. A triple Tyr to Phe mutant at residues 718, 719, and 723 displayed both reduced factor VIII clotting activity and factor Xa generation activity. Finally, a Tyr1680-->Phe mutant factor VIII displayed a 5-fold reduced affinity for von Willebrand factor. The results demonstrate that 1) sulfation at tyrosine residues 346 and 1664 increases factor VIII activity by increasing the rate of thrombin activation and cleavage; 2) sulfation at tyrosine residues 718, 719, and 723 increases the intrinsic activity of factor VIIIa; and 3) sulfation at tyrosine residue 1680 increases the affinity for vWF. In addition, the results implicate that thrombin interacts with three distinct sites within factor VIII, two of which are required for proteolytic activation. The results demonstrate that the six sites of tyrosine sulfation modulate factor VIII activity through different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1640618846,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is phosphorylated and activated by an upstream activator kinase, MEK (MAPK or ERK kinase), in response to mitogenic growth factors. ERKs translocate into the nucleus upon mitogen stimulation, suggesting that the subcellular redistribution of ERK may play a critical role in signal transfer from cytoplasm to the nucleus. We demonstrated in this report that MEK was exclusively localized in cytoplasm in several cell lines, including Swiss 3T3, HeLa, COS, and PC12. Immunofluorescence analysis of both native and transiently expressed MEK with a MEK-specific antibody revealed that both MEK1 and MEK2 were localized only in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization of MEK was further supported by subcellular fractionations as well as detergent permeabilization experiments. In contrast to ERK, mitogen stimulation did not cause any nuclear accumulation of MEK. These data suggest that ERK is phosphorylated and activated in the cytoplasm. The activated ERK could subsequently translocate into the nucleus and phosphorylate its nuclear substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1653126782,"Transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes is controlled primarily by the promoter, which contains several conserved cis-acting elements, including the X, X2, and Y boxes. We show here that RFX, the X box-binding protein that is deficient in certain MHC class II regulatory mutants, binds cooperatively with an X2 box-binding protein (X2bp) to form an RFX.X2bp.DNA complex in which the interaction of the two factors with their target sites is strongly stabilized. A functional role of this RFX.X2bp complex is consistent with mutational analysis of the X and X2 boxes of the DRA and DRB1 class II promoters. Together with previous results demonstrating cooperative binding between RFX and the Y box-binding protein NF-Y, our results indicate that RFX plays a central role in promoting cooperative binding interactions required for stable occupation of the MHC class II promoter. This may explain why the highly specific defect in binding of RFX observed in certain MHC class II regulatory mutants is associated in vivo with a bare promoter in which all of the cis-acting elements, including the X, X2, and Y boxes, are unoccupied."
https://openalex.org/W1523931010,"Oral administration of tungstate for 15 days normalized glycemia in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Simultaneously, the alterations in hepatic glucose metabolism due to diabetes were almost completely counteracted by this treatment. Thus, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase, L-pyruvate kinase, and glycogen phosphorylase alpha activities reached levels similar to those observed in healthy animals. Hepatic levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and glycogen also recovered. However, the recovery of glucokinase activity and hepatic levels of glucose 6-phosphate was only partial. The total activity of glycogen synthase increased, although the activation state was not recovered. Moreover, mRNA levels of hepatic glucokinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase were also normalized. Tungstate administration in healthy animals also affected all these parameters, although to a much lesser extent. All these effects were similar to those previously reported for vanadate, suggesting a common mechanism of action in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1535389484,"The regulatory domain of protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma) contains the following functional elements which can interact with lipids: the pseudosubstrate motif within the first variable region (V1), cysteine-rich domains, Cys1 and Cys2 which contain zinc and bind phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu)/diacylglycerol, and the calcium-dependent lipid binding domain (CaLB). The function of individual or combined segments of the regulatory domain was investigated, using glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and mixed micellar or liposomal assays. GST-Cys1 and GST-Cys2 bound PDBu with comparable affinity (Kd = 14-17 nM). GST-Cys1Cys2 yielded a protein with a PDBu binding affinity of 3.4 nM, in the presence of calcium, similar to that of intact PKC gamma (Kd = 2.6 nM). The phosphatidylserine (PS) dependence of PDBu binding was highly cooperative for all fusion proteins tested with Hill numbers (n) lying in the range of 3.5-4.8, similar to values obtained for intact PKC gamma. While Hill numbers were similar under all conditions, the PS concentration necessary for half-maximal PDBu binding was dependent upon the nature and presence of divalent cations. The PS requirement was lowest in the presence of calcium for GST-Cys1, GST-Cys2, and GST-Cys1Cys2 (Km for PS = 11, 14, and 12 mol %, respectively) but still significantly above the value for intact PKC gamma (5.4 mol %). The data establish Cys1 and Cys2 as independent PDBu binding domains that are modulated by divalent cations. While PDBu binding affinity to a GST-V1Cys1 fusion protein (Kd = 36 nM) was comparable to that of GST-Cys1, the CaLB domain dramatically reduced PDBu binding affinity of GST-Cys2CaLB (Kd = 912 nM). This effect of the CaLB domain on PDBu binding to Cys2 suggests that PDBu/diacylglycerol binding to native PKC gamma may occur at Cys1 and that the Cys2 domain may serve another regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W1622275246,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) comprise a homologous group of transcriptional regulators that control liver and fat differentiation and are involved in regulating the expression of acute phase reactants during the host response to inflammation. GADD153, a unique member of the C/EBP family, has been proposed to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of other C/EBPs, but little is known about its expression in liver or its role in the processes described above. We have examined its expression during the acute phase response (APR) and have shown that like C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta, GADD153 mRNA is markedly induced in livers of rats treated with lipopolysaccharide to initiate the APR. Interestingly, its induction is temporally delayed relative to that of C/EBP beta and C/EBP delta but is similar to that of acute phase reactants shown to be regulated by C/EBPs. Footprint analysis of the GADD153 promoter showed binding of proteins in liver extracts of both untreated and lipopolysaccharide-injected rats to a putative C/EBP regulatory site. Gel shift analysis showed that although present constitutively, binding activity was increased in extracts from lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. Both C/EBP alpha and C/EBP beta were shown to contribute to the binding activity with the contribution by C/EBP beta increasing during the APR. Support for the functional role of this C/EBP-binding site and its interaction with C/EBPs in regulating GADD153 expression was obtained with cultured HepG2 hepatoma cells in which overexpression of C/EBP beta was found to transactivate expression of a plasmid containing the GADD153 promoter linked to a reporter gene. These findings suggest that the GADD153 gene is itself regulated by C/EBPs during the host response to inflammation and that GADD153 is likely to contribute to the regulation of other genes whose expression is altered during the APR."
https://openalex.org/W1504847282,"Previously, we found that deletion of the integrin alpha 4 and alpha 2 subunit cytoplasmic domains, just after the conserved GFFKR motif, causes a loss of adhesive activity mediated by VLA-4 or VLA-2, respectively (Kassner, P.D., and Hemler, M. E. (1993) J. Exp. Med. 178, 649-60; Kawaguchi, S., and Hemler, M. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16279-12685). Here, we show for alpha 4 and alpha 2 chains (expressed in MIP101 and Chinese hamster ovary cells) that adding only 3-4 amino acids after the GFFKR motif restores substantial adhesive activity and that 5-7 amino acids confers maximal adhesive activity (to VCAM-1, CS1 peptide, or collagen, respectively). Point mutations within the most critical 5 alpha 4 residues had no effect on alpha 4 adhesive activity, nor did exchange of the alpha 4 tail with that of alpha 2. Thus, only a short and relatively nonspecific stretch of alpha chain cytoplasmic domain amino acids may be required to achieve maximal integrin adhesive activity. Also, comprehensive divalent cation titration assays revealed (i) that deletion of alpha chain cytoplasmic domains caused a marked decrease in the efficiency of divalent cation utilization during cell adhesion assays and (ii) that cytoplasmic domain deletion effects could be either suppressed or accentuated depending on the type and amount of divalent cation and the cellular environment utilized. Notably, integrin alpha chain tail deletions did not appear to alter the intrinsic ability to interact with ligand because deletion effects were minimal in the presence of metabolic energy inhibitors and were absent during cell-free ligand binding assays."
https://openalex.org/W1640714761,"Fungal (Penicillium chrysogenum) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) ATP sulfurylases were shown to have very similar kinetic and chemical properties except that the fungal enzyme (a) contains a highly reactive Cys residue (SH-1) whose modification results in sigmoidal velocity curves (Renosto, F., Martin, R. L., and Segel, I. H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16279-16288) and (b) is allosterically inhibited by 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), while the yeast enzyme displays neither of these properties. The fungal enzyme subunit (64.3 kDa, 572 amino acids) is also larger than the yeast enzyme subunit (59.3 kDa, 521 amino acids). To correlate the unique allosteric properties of the fungal enzyme with specific structural features, we cloned and sequenced the ATP sulfurylase gene (aps) from P. chrysogenum. The yeast and fungal enzymes are homologous over the first 400 amino acids and contain two regions high in basic residues which are conserved in sulfurylases from Arabidopsis and the Riftia pachyptila (hydrothermal vent tube worm) chemolithotrophic symbiont. These regions may participate in forming the binding sites for MgATP2- and SO4(2-). The fungal enzyme has no sites for MgATP2- and SO4(2-). The fungal enzyme has no significant sequence homology to the yeast enzyme in the C-terminal 172 amino acids. This C-terminal region contains SH-1 (Cys-508) and has homology to MET14 (S. cerevisiae), CYSC (E. coli), and NODQ (Rhizobium meliloti), i.e. adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase. The cumulative results suggest that (a) the allosteric PAPS binding site of P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase is located in the C-terminal domain of the protein and (b) that this domain may have evolved from APS kinase. In spite of the homology, this C-terminal region does not account for the APS kinase activity of P. chrysogenum. Fungal ATP sulfurylase has no significant homology to (or regulatory properties in common with) CYSD or CYSN, proteins reported to comprise E. coli ATP sulfurylase (Leyh, T., Vogt, T. F., and Suo, Y. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 10405-10410)."
https://openalex.org/W1574617342,"Specific antisera were produced to peptides representing the carboxyl terminus of alpha 13, a recently identified alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Immunodetection with the antisera indicated that the 43-kDa protein is expressed ubiquitously at low levels (0.005-0.05% of membrane protein) in tissues and cultured cells. A combination of conventional and immunoaffinity chromatographic techniques was used to purify small quantities of alpha 13 from bovine brain. Quantities of protein sufficient for biochemical analysis could be produced by concurrent expression of alpha 13 with G protein beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits using a baculovirus system. The rate of dissociation of GDP from recombinant alpha 13 (r alpha 13) is slow (0.01-0.02 min-1 at 30 degrees C), and relatively high concentrations of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) are required to observe nucleotide binding. This binding was reduced significantly in the presence of 20 mM Mg2+. Rates of hydrolysis of GTP by alpha 13 were limited by nucleotide exchange; attempts to measure the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis indicate that it is greater than 0.2 min-1. Stoichiometric concentrations of beta gamma subunits inhibited binding of GTP gamma S to and hydrolysis of GTP by alpha 13. By reconstitution, the purified alpha 13 did not affect the activity of several known effector enzymes. The availability of purified r alpha 13 and knowledge of its biochemical properties will allow further characterization of its interactions with receptors and effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1551967777,"Raf-1, a serine/threonine kinase, is required for the mitogenic action of ras p21. It has been recently demonstrated that ras p21 directly associates with Raf-1. The C-terminal region of ras p21 is modified by farnesylation and carboxyl methylation. This modification is necessary for ras p21 function. To elucidate the role of post-translational modification of ras p21 in Raf-1 activation, we examined ras p21-dependent Raf-1 activity in baculovirus/Sf9 cells overexpressing Raf-1 and ras p21. Coexpression of Raf-1 with v-ras p21 in Sf9 cells stimulated the autophosphorylating activity of Raf-1. The activity of Raf-1, as assessed by its ability to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) in vitro, was also increased when Raf-1 was coexpressed with v-ras p21. However, neither the autophosphorylating activity of Raf-1 nor its ability to activate MEK was stimulated by v-ras p21 mutants which are not post-translationally modified. Raf-1 formed a complex with v-ras p21 and the v-ras p21 mutants in Sf9 cells. These results indicate that the post-translational modification of ras p21 is necessary for Raf-1 activation but that the association of Raf-1 with ras p21 is not sufficient to activate Raf-1."
https://openalex.org/W1506088451,"We have examined by in vitro footprinting a region located downstream of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) promoter found to be hypersensitive to DNase I digestion in vivo.

Three AP-1 binding sites and an AP-3-like motif were situated within the R-U5 region of the long terminal repeat. A novel purine-rich motif (5'-GAAAGC-GAAAGDD-3' (D represents G, A, or T residues)), which interacts with a nuclear factor designated downstream binding factor 1 (DBF1), and two juxtaposed Sp-1 binding sites were located in the untranslated sequence immediately downstream of the 5'-long terminal repeat. Genomic footprinting of these sequence elements in the HIV-1 chronically infected cell lines revealed that the DBF1 and Sp-1 sites are occupied in vivo. Furthermore, transient transfection assays showed that point mutations in the DBF1 binding site decreased significantly the HIV-1 basal promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the DBF1 play a role in the HIV-1 transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2266912970,"Cultured rat brain capillary endothelial cells expressed a large 86Rb+ uptake component that was dependent on external Na+ and Cl- and that was inhibited by loop diuretics with unusual pharmacological properties: benzmetanide (IC50 = 1-5 microM) = bumetanide (IC50 = 1-5 microM) > piretanide (IC50 = 3-16 microM) = furosemide (IC50 = 7-11 microM). It was activated 2-fold by endothelin-1 (EC50 = 1 nM) and endothelin-3 (EC50 = 9 nM). The actions of endothelins were prevented by BQ-123 (cyclo-(D-Trp-D-Asp-Pro-D-Val-Leu)) in a competitive manner and with a high affinity, thus indicating the involvement of an atypical BQ-123-sensitive, ETA-like receptor that had a high affinity for endothelin-3. Neither protein kinase C nor Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinases mediated the actions of endothelins. Cotransport activity was increased 4-fold by hyperosmotic cell shrinkage. Basal Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport activity was partially inhibited by isoproterenol and was unaffected by agents that promoted cGMP formation. Calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, stimulated cotransport activity and potentiated the action of endothelin-1, but not that of cell shrinkage. Basal and stimulated cotransport activities were inhibited by genistein, a protein kinase inhibitor with similar potencies, and by staurosporine, which has different potencies. Finally, endothelin-1-stimulated activity was partially and specifically inhibited by interleukin-1. It is concluded that rat brain capillary endothelial cells express a Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransporter that has unique properties and that is regulated by multiple protein kinase/phosphatase systems. It is a target for low concentrations of endothelins and may play a role in brain-to-blood movements of K+."
https://openalex.org/W1581747947,"The human general transcription factors IIA and IIB bind directly to the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), and modulate transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. RAP30, the small subunit of TFIIF, binds to TFIIB and RNA polymerase II and recruits RNA polymerase II to a preinitiation complex containing TBP and TFIIB. By using the adenovirus 2 major late promoter tagged site-specifically with the photoactivatible cross-linking reagent N3R-dUMP we have localized TBP, two subunits of TFIIA (A35 and A21), TFIIB, and RAP30 along promoter DNA. TFIIA cross-linked to the coding strand opposite TBP at the TATA box and cross-linked upstream of TBP around position -40. RAP30 cross-linked strongly and TFIIB weakly to the coding strand just downstream of TBP at -19. We interpret these data in the context of a molecular structure for the TBP promoter complex."
https://openalex.org/W1553782561,"An RNA editing mechanism converts C to U at nucleotide 6666 in apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA. The catalytic subunit of the editing enzyme, p27, was recently cloned. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, p27 required other proteins to edit apoB mRNA in vitro (Teng, B., Burant, C. F., and Davidson, N. O. (1993) Science 260, 1816-1819). In this study, we expressed p27 in McArdle 7777 cells, which edit apoB mRNA with low efficiency. The levels of editing enzyme increased 10-fold, and editing of the endogenous apoB mRNA increased 2-fold in p27-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that p27 is involved in editing in mammalian cells. p27 was also expressed in COS cells, which do not synthesize apoB and lack editing activity. Extracts from p27-transfected cells acquired the ability to edit apoB mRNA only when extracts from other tissues were added. This reconstituted enzyme had the same sequence specificity as the native enzyme. The activity that complemented p27 function was detected in baboon liver and in tissues that do not synthesize apoB, including kidney and testis. The COS expression system was used to analyze the structure and function of p27, which contains a putative zinc finger (His61, Cys93, and Cys96) similar to other cytidine deaminases. Site-directed mutagenesis of His61 to Arg, Pro92 to Leu, or Cys96 to Ser abolished p27 activity. The zinc finger in p27 may be required for catalysis, protein-protein interactions, or binding to apoB mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1499141978,"Abstract Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) in the plasma are a risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke. Plasma Lp(a) concentrations are highly heritable and predominantly determined by the liver-specific apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) gene. In this report we show by deletion analysis that sequences from -98 to +130 of the apo(a) gene are sufficient to direct liver-specific transcription. DNase I protection analysis of this region using HepG2 nuclear extracts revealed six major protein-binding sites, designated A to F. A mutation within footprint C, situated in the 5'-untranslated region of the gene, resulted in a marked reduction of luciferase expression from a reporter construct to 12% of wild type. This was not due to a decrease in mRNA stability. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that site C binds hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1 alpha), and overexpression of HNF-1 alpha in HepG2 cells resulted in a significant stimulation of transcription from this promoter fragment. Mutation of footprint B resulted in a 2-fold enhancement of transcription. These results show that positive regulation of transcription of the apo(a) gene is dependent on the binding of HNF-1 alpha to a regulatory element situated downstream of the mRNA start site, and suggest that an as yet unidentified protein may negatively regulate apo(a) transcription by binding to a discrete sequence within the 5'-untranslated region."
https://openalex.org/W1666542173,"The 17-kilobase kps gene cluster of Escherichia coli K1 contains all the information necessary for the expression of capsular polysaccharide. Region 3 of the cluster encodes two genes, kpsM and kpsT, whose products belong to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)-transporter protein family. The KpsMT system is involved with the export of capsular polysaccharide in E. coli. Earlier work indicated that interaction between KpsT and ATP is important for transport. In this study, we report that KpsT, a peripheral inner membrane protein, can be photolabeled by the ATP analog, 8-N3[gamma-32P]ATP. The derivatization of KpsT by this reagent is inhibited by cold ATP or ATP gamma S. Furthermore, the protein seems to require a membrane environment for efficient photolabeling, but does not require any other kps gene products. Results obtained from saturation mutagenesis of the ATP-binding consensus sequence of KpsT and the phenotypes of strains with defined mutations in the chromosomal gene, are consistent with the view that ATP-binding by KpsT is required for transport of polymer across the inner membrane. The structure of KpsT was compared to a model developed for other ABC-transport proteins, and important functional regions were determined. The results obtained from chemical mutagenesis of kpsT are consistent with the model and revealed characteristics particular to capsule transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1574332089,"Matrix vesicles (MV) were shown to initiate mineralization in cartilage and other vertebrate tissues. However, the factors that drive this process remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have shown that a preformed nucleational core consisting mainly of a Ca(2+)-phosphatidylserine-Pi complex, is necessary for the accumulation of Ca2+ by MV. In addition, the collagens attached to the MV surface were shown to play an important role in stimulating Ca2+ uptake. In this study, we extend this knowledge by showing that both, the nucleational core and the collagens (types II and X), are co-requirements for rapid influx of Ca2+ into intact MV. MV to which collagen fragments were attached were released from hypertrophic chicken cartilage by trypsin and collagenase digestion (trypsin/collagenase-released MV (TCRMV), while collagen-free MV were released by hyaluronidase and collagenase digestion (hyaluronidase/collagenase-released MV (HCRMV). In contrast to TCRMV which showed active uptake of Ca2+, HCRMV showed only little uptake. However, binding of native type II collagen to HCRMV stimulated uptake of Ca2+. Sucrose gradients separated TCRMV and HCRMV into three different density fractions: a low density top fraction (SI), an intermediate density middle fraction (SII), and a high density pellet fraction (SIII). The SIII fractions of TCRMV and HCRMV contained significantly higher levels of mineral ions than did the SI and SII fractions. Only the SIII fraction of TCRMV which contained a stable nucleational core and surface-attached collagens, showed active Ca2+ uptake; all other sucrose fractions of TCRMV and HCRMV showed little or no uptake. Detergent treatment to purposely rupture the membrane greatly enhanced Ca2+ uptake by the SIII fraction of HCRMV, presumably by exposing the internal nucleational core. Addition of either native type II or type X collagen to the intact SIII fraction of HCRMV stimulated Ca2+ uptake to a level similar to that of the SIII fraction of TCRMV; however, incubation of the SI and SII fractions of either TCRMV or HCRMV with type II or X collagen did not activate Ca2+ uptake. These findings indicate that both a functional nucleational core and surface-attached collagens need to be present to support active mineralization of MV."
https://openalex.org/W1597630334,"Culture supernatants of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor were found to contain Mn(III)-complexing agents able to effectively promote manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP)-mediated oxidation of phenol red. The high molecular weight fractions of these supernatants contained carbohydrate polymers that functioned as effective Mn(III)-complexing agents. Gluconic and glucuronic acids were also found to be effective Mn(III)-complexing ligands capable of supporting MnP-mediated phenol red oxidation, as was the cellobionic acid formed from cellobiose by cellobiose:quinone oxidoreductase (CBQase) (EC 1.1.5.1). The formation of cellulose-derived sugar acid manganese-complexing agents by CBQase increased in the presence of wood pulp and cellulolytic enzymes. CBQase, while oxidizing cellobiose, reduced insoluble Mn(IV)O2 to Mn(II) or Mn(III) by a reaction whose rate is determined by the nature of the manganese-complexing agents present. A model is proposed to explain how oxidation of carbohydrate and reduction of MnO2 and quinones by CBQase may complement oxidation by MnP, thus promoting lignin biodegradation."
https://openalex.org/W1526269844,"Enteropeptidase (EC 3.4.21.9) is a key enzyme in the intestinal digestion cascade responsible for the conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin, which then activates various pancreatic zymogens. In order to structurally characterize the enzyme, we purified the enzyme from porcine duodenal mucosa and showed that it consists of three polypeptide chains, which we named mini chain (M chain), light chain (L chain), and heavy chain (H chain) in order of increasing molecular size. Based on their NH2-terminal sequences, a cDNA clone for porcine enteropeptidase was isolated and analyzed. The clone was 3597 base pairs long, which encoded 1034 amino acid residues of a single-chain precursor form of enteropeptidase. The precursor contained an additional NH2-terminal 51-residue sequence including a putative internal signal sequence, followed by the M chain (66 residues), the H chain (682 residues), and the L chain (235 residues) in that order. The H chain had regions partially homologous in sequence with low density lipoprotein receptor and complement components. On the other hand, the L chain was highly homologous with the catalytic domains of trypsin-like serine proteinases. The structural model of the L chain suggests that the sequence, Arg885-Arg-Arg-Lys888, is probably involved in the unique substrate specificity of the enzyme, preferring acidic amino acid residues at the P2-P5 sites."
https://openalex.org/W1569232414,"We systematically investigated the effect of heterology on RecA-mediated strand exchange between double-stranded linear and single-stranded circular DNA. Strand exchange took place through heterologies of up to 150-200 base pairs when the insertion was at the proximal (initiating) end of the duplex DNA but was completely blocked by an insert of only 22 base pairs placed at the distal end of the duplex. In the case of medial heterology created by insertion either in the duplex or the single-stranded DNA, the ability of RecA to exchange strands decreased as the heterology was shifted toward the distal end of the duplex. These results suggest that two different strand exchange mechanisms operate in the proximal and distal portions of the duplex substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1550738149,"LMWP is the low molecular weight protein which copurifies with alpha-latrotoxin, the main neurotoxin from the black widow venom. It contains 70 residues and three disulfides. We found that its primary structure, including its 6 half-cystines, can be aligned with the amino acid sequences of crustacean hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs) which contain 72-73 residues and three disulfides. To further investigate this structural relationship, we produced a recombinant analog of LMWP in which the unique Met was changed in Leu (LMWPM35L). LMWPM35L was produced as a folded fusion protein in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and was generated in vitro by treating the fusion protein with cyanogen bromide. We showed that LMWPM35L and CHHs have an identical disulfide pairing pattern and possess some alpha-helical structure, as deduced from a comparison of their circular dichroism spectra. In addition, LMWPM35L and CHHs are consensually predicted to possess a helical structure within the region 13-17. Together, the data indicate that CHHs are structurally related to LMWPM35L and presumably also to LMWP. Finally, preliminary studies showed that LMWPM35L is not toxic to mice and does not form channels in lipid bilayers, two well-known properties of alpha-latrotoxin preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1505974331,"A cardiolipin- and protease-activated protein kinase (PAK) has been isolated from cytoplasmic extracts of rat liver. The enzyme (PAK-1) phosphorylates the ribosomal protein S6-(229-239) peptide analogue and can be activated by limited proteolysis. Partial amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from both the purified 116-kDa PAK-1 holoenzyme and its active catalytic fragment reveal that the catalytic domain is most related (50-58% identity) to the protein kinase C family. PAK-1 has protein and peptide substrate specificities distinct from those of known protein kinase C isoforms and is insensitive to inhibition by the protein kinase C-alpha-(19-31) pseudosubstrate peptide. Phosphatidylserine, diacylglycerol, and phorbol ester do not activate PAK-1 toward the S6 peptide substrate. However, other acidic phospholipids, the most effective being cardiolipin, activate PAK-1 to a similar extent as trypsin. The PAK-1 catalytic activities generated through activation by cardiolipin or limited proteolysis were kinetically similar, with Km values of 3.6 and 3.4 microM, respectively, for the S6-(229-239) peptide substrate. However, differences were observed in the catalytic activities with protamine sulfate and the glycogen synthase-(1-12) peptide analogue as substrates. It was concluded that PAK-1 is a phospholipid-regulated protein kinase with a primary structure, substrate specificity, and mechanism of regulation in vitro distinct from those of any known member of the protein kinase C superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1645539664,"A cDNA encoding the long isoform of the rat thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) receptor was expressed stably in HEK-293 cells. Polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed expression of mRNA encoding only the long and not the short isoform. Activation of this receptor with TRH caused a large stimulation in production of inositol phosphates but did not produce either activation of basal or inhibition of forskolin-amplified adenylyl cyclase activity. Sustained exposure of these transfected cells to TRH resulted in a substantial reduction in cellular levels of Gq alpha-like immunoreactivity from some 12 to 5 pmol/mg of membrane protein without significant alterations in cellular levels of the alpha subunits of Gs, Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, or Go. Equivalent experiments in GH3 cells also indicated a marked down-regulation of Gq alpha/G11 alpha. Dose-response curves indicated that 20 nM TRH produced half-maximal down-regulation of cellular Gq-like immunoreactivity in the transfected HEK-293 cells and that half-maximal loss was produced within 3-4 h. Separation of the transfected HEK-293 cell membranes in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis conditions able to resolve individual members of the Gq family of G-proteins demonstrated the presence of two related G-proteins. Both of the expressed Gq-like G-proteins were observed to be down-regulated in parallel by TRH. The similarity of dose-response curves and time-courses for loss of the two G-proteins indicates that the long isoform of the rat TRH receptor does not functionally select between these two transducer proteins. In GH3 cells both Gq alpha and G11 alpha, which are expressed at similar levels, were observed to be down-regulated equivalently by treatment with TRH."
https://openalex.org/W1608826224,"Platelet basic protein (PBP) (94 residues) is naturally processed via N-terminal cleavage to yield connective tissue activating peptide-III (85 residues), beta-thromboglobulin (81 residues), and neutrophil activating peptide-2 (70 residues). Chemical cross-linking and gel filtration data indicate that each homolog can form dimers and tetramers. Subunit association equilibria for dimer (KD) and tetramer (KT) formation have been derived for each species from 1H NMR (600 MHz) spectral analysis of slowly exchanging (NMR time scale) monomer- dimer-tetramer aggregation state populations. In general, raising the pH from about pH 3.5 to pH 6 increases KD by two to three orders in magnitude and decreases KT by some 50-fold. Ionic strength effects also suggest that intersubunit electrostatic interactions are critical to subunit association. Subunit stabilization can be ranked proportional to N-terminal chain length: platelet basic protein > connective tissue activating peptide-III > beta-thromboglobulin > neutrophil activating peptide-2. Under more physiologic conditions, PBP family monomers are favored at normal cytokine protein concentrations and may form the biologically active state. CD and NMR data indicate conservation of alpha-helix and anti-parallel beta-sheet structure among PBP-related species and support the idea that the extended N terminus folds over and masks the neutrophil activation domain and is part of the intersubunit binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1563548332,"Carboxypeptidase E (CPE), a neuropeptide processing enzyme, is present in neuroendocrine tissues in soluble and membrane-associated forms. The membrane-associated forms do not contain a conventional transmembrane-spanning domain; instead, the C-terminal region of CPE has been proposed to form an amphiphilic helix which binds to the membrane. To test this, and to investigate the possible contribution of this C-terminal sequence to the intracellular sorting of CPE into the regulated pathway, the C-terminal region of CPE was attached to albumin and the recombinant proteins expressed in AtT-20 cells. Albumin itself showed little association with membranes under the conditions examined. A construct containing albumin with only 9 residues of CPE, corresponding to a highly charged region immediately preceding the potential amphiphilic helix region, showed generally similar membrane binding and secretion rates as albumin alone. When the C-terminal 51 amino acids of CPE were attached to the C terminus of albumin and the recombinant protein detected with an antisera raised against the C terminus of CPE, virtually all of the protein was membrane-associated. This finding suggests that the C-terminal region of CPE functions as a membrane anchor. The secretion of albumin with the C-terminal region of CPE was stimulated by a phorbol ester and by forskolin, although the magnitude of the stimulation was smaller than the effect of these compounds on the secretion of CPE. These results imply that the C-terminal region of CPE contains the membrane anchor and contributes to the sorting of this protein into the regulated pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1527011120,"We have identified a new spliced leader (SL) in Fasciola hepatica by characterizing the 5'-terminal sequences of its enolase mRNA, an mRNA also trans-spliced in the flatworm Schistosoma mansoni (Rajkovic, A., Davis, R.E., Simonsen, J.N., and Rottman, F.M. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 8879-8883). This 37-nucleotide spliced leader is at the 5' ends of multiple Fasciola mRNAs and is likely to be derived from the 5' terminus of a nonpolyadenylated, 108-nucleotide RNA with a trimethylguanosine cap. The SL RNA gene is present in approximately 100 copies within a 1.1-kilobase genomic tandem repeat. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the Fasciola SL RNA contains three stem loops in contrast to two previously observed in S. mansoni. Fasciola and S. mansoni SLs are likely to be evolutionarily related although their sequence identity is only 65%. In contrast with nematodes, absolute conservation of SL sequences and secondary structure does not occur in trematodes. A spliced leader in Fasciola indicates that trans-splicing is likely to be a common feature in other trematodes and perhaps other flatworms."
https://openalex.org/W1575829284,"We report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA that encodes a novel extracellular epidermal molecule, epidermal surface antigen (ESA), which is thought to play a role in intercellular epidermal adhesion. Sequence analysis reveals that the 379 amino acid ESA has a molecular mass of about 41.7 kDa and an alpha-helix-rich secondary conformation. Much of this also has an heptad substructure, consistent with the formation of several bundles of alpha-helices in a compact globular structure. The ESA protein appears to consist of an NH2-terminal hydrophobic region with mixed alpha and beta structure followed by a more hydrophilic COOH-terminal region which is very rich in alpha-helix. The 2.5-kilobase ESA mRNA is expressed in cultured keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, carcinoma, and melanoma cell lines. The ESA gene is conserved in all mammalian species examined and has been localized to human chromosome 17 (M17S1) in the same region as the gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis. The high level of expression of the ESA mRNA in human skin and in cultured cells derived from the epidermis, the appearance of ESA protein early in human development, and conservation of the ESA gene throughout mammalian evolution suggest that the novel ESA protein plays a vital role in epidermal structure and maintenance."

We have used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot analysis, and enzyme assays to determine the cellular localization of the enzyme. We find that the enzyme is present, but not exclusively, in the nucleus of Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, and also in COS-7 and HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding bovine inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase. DNA synthesis, as measured in COS-7 and HeLa cells transiently over-expressing enzyme, was reduced 50% in cells transfected with wild-type enzyme compared with nontransfected cells or cells transfected with an inactive mutant form of the enzyme. These data demonstrate that this response is mediated by one of the substrates or products of inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase. We propose that overexpressed inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase degrades a stimulatory inositol phosphate(s) and thereby inhibits DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2138995373,"The neurotrophins are members of a family of structurally and functionally related neurotrophic factors that control the development and maintenance of vertebrate neurons. The crystal structure of nerve growth factor (NGF), the prototypic member of this family, contains three pairs of anti-parallel beta-strands connected by beta-hairpin loops, which contain most of the variable residues among the four neurotrophin proteins. Recently, amino acid residues in these variable loop regions have been implicated in the interaction between NGF and its signal-transducing receptor TrkA. In NGF, residues 40-49 (variable region II) span a very flexible and solvent-accessible beta-hairpin loop that is highly variable between different neurotrophins. To investigate the role of this domain in determining biological specificities in the neurotrophin family, we constructed a series of chimeric molecules by exchanging this variable region among three neurotrophins (i.e. NGF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4)) that bind and activate three different Trk receptors (i.e. TrkA, -C, and -B, respectively). The chimeric molecules were analyzed for their ability to activate different Trk receptor subtypes and to promote the survival of subpopulations of peripheral neurons expressing specific types of Trk mRNAs. Exchange of the 40-49 variable loop region between NGF and NT-3 resulted in molecules capable of activating both TrkA and TrkC receptors and of rescuing neurons containing TrkA and TrkC mRNAs, indicating that this loop plays an important role in determining biological specificities in these two neurotrophins. Furthermore, variable region II from NT-4 conferred the ability to differentiate nnr5 PC12-TrkB cells to a chimeric NT-3 molecule that was originally incapable of eliciting a response in these cells. In contrast, exchanges between NGF and NT-4 did not suffice to generate molecules with broader biological specificities, suggesting that other regions in these molecules are also required. Our results support the evolutionary relationships between the three polypeptides deduced from structural comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W1580118319,"In this report we describe a novel chymotrypsin-like serine protease produced by Streptomyces griseus. The enzyme has been tentatively named S. griseus protease C (SGPC). The gene encoding the enzyme (sprC) was identified and isolated on the basis of its homology to the previously characterized S. griseus protease B (SGPB). The sprC gene encodes a 457-amino acid prepro-mature protein of which only the 255 carboxyl-terminal amino acids are present in the mature enzyme. Mature SGPC contains two distinct domains connected by a 19-amino acid linker region rich in threonines and prolines. While the amino-terminal domain is homologous to S. griseus proteases A, B, and E and the alpha-lytic protease of Lysobacter enzymogenes, the carboxyl-terminal domain is not homologous with any known protease. However, the carboxyl-terminal domain shares extensive homology with chitin-binding domains of Bacillus circulans chitinases A1 and D, suggesting that the enzyme is specialized for the degradation of chitin-linked proteins. Recombinant expression and preliminary characterization of the catalytic properties of the enzyme are also reported. The primary specificity of SGPC is similar to that of SGPB; both enzymes preferentially cleave peptide bonds following large hydrophobic side chains."
https://openalex.org/W1937262478,"The a-factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YIIKGVF-WDPAC(Farnesyl)-OCH3) is a peptide pheromone in which post-translational modification with a farnesyl isoprenoid and carboxyl methyl group is required for export and bioactivity. Truncated and carboxyl-terminal modified analogs of the a-factor were synthesized in order to determine the effect of such modifications on bioactivity. Bioactivity studies on carboxyl-terminal analogs in which the chirality, the cysteine thioether, and the carboxyl ester were varied in an attempt to study the influence of topology on a-factor activity indicate that the hydrophobicity conferred by the farnesyl moiety and not its specific spatial orientation is a key determinant of a-factor potency. Analyses on truncated a-factors suggest that sequential removal of NH2-terminal residues leads to a gradient of potency loss, with some amino acids exhibiting a slightly greater contribution to bioactivity than others. Random oligonucleotide-targeted mutagenesis of the gene encoding a-factor was coupled to a biological screen to identify altered a-factor peptides which are secreted yet exhibit a loss of a-factor bioactivity. Transformants exhibiting this phenotype were examined to identify codon changes presumably responsible for the altered phenotype, thus indicating residues that may contribute significantly to a-factor bioactivity."
https://openalex.org/W1564270243,"We developed a screen involving alkaline phosphatase gene fusions to identify mutations altering the membrane topology of a bacterial chemoreceptor (Escherichia coli Tsr). We identified three informative classes of mutations causing increased export of the protein's normally cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain. The first class consisted of deletions eliminating all or most of the membrane-spanning sequence (TM2) immediately amino-terminal to the cytoplasmic domain. The second class consisted of mutations altering a highly amphipathic sequence at the beginning of the domain. The third class of mutation was a deletion of an upstream spanning sequence (TM1). The amphipathic sequence appears to be a novel determinant of membrane topology whose function is not due to its positive residue density. The amphipathic character of the sequence is relatively well-conserved in chemoreceptors and their relatives. Although deletions removing the amphipathic sequence or TM1 alone caused only partial carboxyl-terminal domain export, a double mutation removing both caused efficient export. This result suggests that the two sequences function independently to promote normal membrane insertion. The independent functioning of the two sequences may help ensure that Tsr insertion is normally a high fidelity process."

It consists of mucin-like glycoproteins (designated as cobra venom mucin) in noncovalent association with several lower molecular weight proteins and glycoproteins. The mucin was purified by CsBr density gradient centrifugation under dissociative conditions. The purified venom mucin comprised about 85% carbohydrate and 15% protein and was rich in Thr, Ser, Pro, Gly, Glu, Asp, and Ala. The mucin was resolved into two or more distinct classes of mucin-like glycoproteins which differ in their amino acid compositions and/or carbohydrate content. Unlike other mucins, cobra venom mucin does not form highly viscous solutions. It appears to keep several venom proteins and glycoproteins soluble by noncovalent interactions. Cobra venom mucin contains both O- and N-linked oligosaccharides; 1 N-linked chain for every 8-10 O-linked oligosaccharides. The O-linked chains are novel structures with high molar proportions of fucose, galactose, and N-acetylglucosamine relative to N-acetylgalactosamine; they have a very low sialic acid content and lack sulfate esters. The majority of the O-linked oligosaccharides are unusually large and contain 15 to as many as 50 sugar residues. The O-linked oligosaccharides are poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl chains consisting of -3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1- and -3Gal beta 1-4(Fuc alpha 1-3)GlcNAc beta 1- repeats and thus they contain inner Le(X) antigenic determinants.

We analyzed its structure by determining the expression of mutant M-CSF cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary cells. PG-M-CSF contained two types of molecules, a homodimeric 150-200-kDa subunit and a heterodimeric form of a 43-kDa subunit and the 150-200-kDa subunit. The 150-200-kDa subunit carries a chondroitin sulfate chain, and its amino-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to that of the 43-kDa subunit, which is known to form the conventional M-CSF molecule (85-kDa M-CSF). The results obtained with the carboxyl-terminal deleted mutants showed that the PG-M-CSF-specific 150-200-kDa subunit had a large part of the precursor sequence at its carboxyl terminus removed in the 43-kDa subunit by proteolytic processing. The expression of mutagenized cDNA, in which Arg220 was replaced by an alanine residue, resulted in the disappearance of the 43-kDa subunit but not that of the 150-200-kDa subunit, indicating that Arg220-Pro-Pro-Arg is essential to process PG-M-CSF to 85-kDa M-CSF. Truncated mutation analysis showed that the carboxyl terminus of the 150-200-kDa subunit lay downstream of Arg412. We also showed that the chondroitin sulfate binding site in the 150-200-kDa subunit was Ser277, since conversion of Ser277 to the alanine residue resulted in complete loss of the chondroitin sulfate substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1586283857,"Potential molecular targets of a protective humoral immune response against schistosomiasis have previously been identified based on their enhanced immunogenicity in mice vaccinated with irradiated cercaria as compared to chronically infected mice. One of these antigens, IrV1, has been molecularly cloned and its sequence shown to be similar to the molecular chaperone calnexin. In this investigation, we partially characterized IrV1 from different developmental stages of the schistosome. Immunoprecipitation studies with antibodies raised against a portion of recombinant IrV1 demonstrated its presence in cercaria, schistosomula, and adult worms with an apparent molecular mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 90 kDa. There was an approximate 6-fold increase in protein expression level during the cercaria to schistosomula transformation. Consistent with a potential role as a molecular chaperone, IrV1 was associated with several metabolically labeled proteins in co-immunoprecipitation studies with the adult worm tegumental fraction. Similar to calnexin, IrV1 was metabolically labeled with 32P in adult worms on serine and threonine residues and was one of the major phosphoproteins of this stage. This phosphorylation was developmentally regulated and coincided with the transformation of cercaria into schistosomula. The localization was also stage-specific as IrV1 was transported from internal regions of cercaria to the outer tegumental layer of schistosomula. The presence of IrV1 on the surface of schistosomula, an unprecedented localization for this family of endoplasmic reticulum proteins, supports additional studies of the immunoprophylactic potential of this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1504192565,"Alkylation of Cys-89 of the gamma subunit of the coupling factor portion (CF1) of the chloroplast ATP synthase by N-ethylmaleimide was previously shown to inhibit ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The gamma subunit interacts with the inhibitory epsilon subunit. Alkylation of gamma Cys-89 could cause changes that result in the strengthening of the interactions between the two subunits which would be inhibitory. We show that the inhibition of the ATPase activity of CF1 in solution persists after removal of the epsilon subunit. Additionally, epsilon rebinds to control and alkylated CF1 at very similar CF1 to epsilon concentration ratios. Although the bound nucleotide contents of control and alkylated CF1 were similar, the rate of exchange of nucleotide bound to one site with medium nucleotide was accelerated by more than two orders of magnitude by alkylation. We show that ATP-induced release of bound 2'(3')-O-trinitrophenyl-adenosine 5'-diphosphate can be monitored conveniently by stopped-flow fluorescence. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide modification are likely to be felt over long distances. As determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, no nucleotide binding site so far mapped is closer than 5 nm to Cys-89. The bulky maleimide probably causes structural changes that perturb subunit and catalytic site interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1596534657,"In a search for novel factors that interact with the octamer element, immunoglobulin kappa light chain (V kappa) and heavy chain VH) gene promoters were compared for binding to nuclear proteins from lymphoid cells. Both promoters showed a similar pattern of bound factors, which was entirely different from that seen with the human immunodeficiency virus, type I promoter. Besides OTF-1 (Oct-1) and OTF-2 (Oct-2), at least three additional complexes were observed. Two of these were functionally analyzed: C1, a slowly migrating complex, which was much more abundant in B cells than in non-lymphoid cells, and C4, which appeared to have ubiquitous distribution. As determined by several methods, the protein(s) forming the C1 complex bound on the V kappa gene to a site that partially covers the octamer element, whereas, surprisingly, in the VH gene a region spanning the TATA box up to the transcriptional initiation site was recognized. The ubiquitous C4 complex was analyzed for the light chain promoter. The protein specifically bound to a site immediately 5' to the octamer. By in vitro transcription analysis, we found that C4 augments the octamer-dependent transcription of the V kappa gene. The activation required binding of OTF-1/OTF-2, and C4 could not stimulate transcription by itself, implying a synergistic interaction. Due to the overlapping binding sites, the effect of C1 by itself could not be clearly separated from the C4 effect. However, the specific interaction of C1 with crucial control elements of light chain and heavy chain promoters strongly suggests a functional role in immunoglobulin gene transcription control."
https://openalex.org/W1576438216,"Macrophage activation results in the secretion of various proteins, such as inflammatory cytokines and proteases. In parallel, cell morphology is altered, and the repertoire of cell surface proteins is modified. One of the main functions of macrophages is phagocytosis via Fc gamma-receptors (Fc gamma R). This study explores the modulation of Fc gamma Rs and their mRNAs following activation of macrophages by tumor necrosis factor. It shows that the cell surface expression of Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RIIb is strongly reduced in macrophages cultured in the presence of tumor necrosis factor, whereas the mRNA of the Fc gamma RIIb is strongly increased as the result of an increase in mRNA stability. Thus, Fc gamma RIIb expression is modulated during macrophage activation by a new mechanism involving posttranscriptional regulation."

The two types of analysis give essentially the same results, except that smaller responses to perturbations are observed for the model analyzed by metabolic control theory. The basis for this difference is discussed."
