https://openalex.org/W1557190042,"A significant development in computing has been the discovery that the computational power of quantum computers exceeds that of Turing machines. Central to the experimental realization of quantum information processing is the construction of fault-tolerant quantum logic gates. Their operation requires conditional quantum dynamics, in which one sub-system undergoes a coherent evolution that depends on the quantum state of another sub-system; in particular, the evolving sub-system may acquire a conditional phase shift. Although conventionally dynamic in origin, phase shifts can also be geometric. Conditional geometric (or 'Berry') phases depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and are therefore resilient to certain types of errors; this suggests the possibility of an intrinsically fault-tolerant way of performing quantum gate operations. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have already been used to demonstrate both simple quantum information processing and geometric phase shifts. Here we combine these ideas by performing a nuclear magnetic resonance experiment in which a conditional Berry phase is implemented, demonstrating a controlled phase shift gate."

Several lines of evidence suggest that p53 death signals lead to caspase activation; however, the mechanism of caspase activation by p53 still is unclear. Expressing wild type p53 by means of an adenoviral expression vector, we were able to induce apoptotic cell death, as characterized by morphological changes, phosphatidylserine externalization, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, in p53null Saos-2 cells. This cell death was accompanied by caspase activation as well as by cleavage of caspase substrates and was preceded by mitochondrial cytochrome c release. The addition of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) directly after transduction almost completely prevented p53-induced apoptotic cell death but did not inhibit mitochondrial cytochrome crelease. In contrast, N-acetylcysteine, even at high concentrations, could not prevent induction of programmed cell death by p53 expression. Cytosolic extracts from Saos-2 cells transduced with p53, but not from Saos-2 cells transduced with the empty adenoviral vector, contained a cytochrome c-releasing activityin vitro, which was still active in the presence of zVAD-fmk. When Bax was immunodepleted from the cytosolic extracts of p53-expressing cells before incubation with isolated mitochondria, thein vitro cytochrome c release was abolished. Thus, we could demonstrate in cells and in vitro that p53 activates the apoptotic machinery through induction of the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Furthermore, we provide in vitro evidence for the requirement of cytosolic Bax for this cytochromec-releasing activity of p53 in Saos-2 cells.

The cell cycle regulatory and the DNA repair functions of p53 are largely executed by transactivation of p53-response genes such as p21/WAF1/CIP1 (2.El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B.

In contrast, the tumor-suppressing activity of p53 does not depend on its transactivational function (7.Crook T. Marston N.J. Sara E.A. Vousden K.H.

It has been shown in several cell types that wild type (wt)1 p53 is required for the apoptotic cell death as induced by γ-irradiation or a variety of anticancer drugs (11.Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E.

However, several lines of evidence imply that the proapoptotic activity of p53 is independent of its function as a transcription factor (20.Caelles C. Heimberg A. Karin M.

The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is a central event in the death receptor-independent, “intrinsic,” apoptotic pathway (23.Reed J.C.

Cytochrome c together with ATP and Apaf-1 facilitates activation by caspase 9 of the effector caspases (25.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Furthermore, cytochrome c release can also occur in death receptor-dependent, “extrinsic,” apoptotic pathways by cleavage and activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid through caspase 8 (29.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 30.Li H. Zhou H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

Several studies were undertaken to establish the involvement of caspase activation in p53-mediated cell death (18.Müller M. Wilder S. Bannasch D. Israeli D. Lehlbach K. Li-Weber M. Friedman S.L. Galle P.R. Oren M. Krammer P.H. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar,32.Yu Y. Little J.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 5: 4277-4281Google Scholar, 33.Ding H.-F. McGill G.

Recently, the requirement of Apaf-1 or caspase 9 for the p53-dependent apoptosis of oncogene-transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts has been conclusively demonstrated (36.Soengas M.S. Alarcón R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to address the hypothesis that p53 might induce apoptosis by a death receptor-independent pathway involving the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. We show in Saos-2 cells that p53 evokes cytochrome c release prior to caspase activation and prior to the occurrence of apoptotic cell membrane changes. Furthermore, we biochemically demonstrate the requirement of cytosolic Bax protein for the cytochromec-releasing activity of p53. Thereby, in our experimental system, we provide a link between p53 and the death receptor-independent activation of the apoptotic machinery downstream of mitochondria. The human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 cells was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and was maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Antibodies against cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12), caspase 3 (polyclonal rabbit antiserum), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (clone C2–10), p53 (clones Do-7 and PAb122), p21/WAF1/CIP1 (clone SX118), and Bax (polyclonal rabbit antiserum) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antisera against protein kinase C-δ and JNK1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and an antibody against actin (clone C4) was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). A rabbit antiserum against caspase 9 has been described previously (37.Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Stennicke H.R. Jürgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (zVAD-fmk) and the fluorochromic caspase substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp aminofluoromethylcoumarin (DEVD-afc) were purchased from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). Replication-deficient adenoviral vectors were generous gifts from Drs. D. C. Maneval and I. Atencio, Canji Inc., San Diego, CA. The vectors either encoded the complete human wt p53 cDNA (Ad.p53) or green fluorescent protein (Ad.GFP) under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate/early gene promotor (39.Wills K.N. Maneval D.C. Menzel P. Harris M.P. Sutjipto S. Vaillancourt M.-T. Huang W.-M. Johnson D.E. Anderson S.C. Wen S.F. Bookstein R. Shepard H.M. Gregory R.J. Hum.

Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1403-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The Ad.GFP vector was applied to determine infectibility and maximal tolerated dose of Saos-2 cells, which was found to be 109 particles/ml. For further experiments, the Ad.p53 vector was used for p53 gene transfer, and the empty adenoviral vector (Ad) served as control. Approximately 18 h before transduction, cells were passaged in 10-cm culture dishes or 12-well plates (Fisher) at a density of 200,000/ml or 50,000/ml, respectively. Vectors were diluted in serum-free medium (Optimem I, Life Technologies, Inc.) at the appropriate dose (109particles/ml). Cells were pulsed with the vectors for 60 min, washed, and supplemented with fresh growth medium containing fetal calf serum. For flow cytometry, cells were harvested by mild trypsinization, followed by washing with growth medium and phosphate-buffered saline. Cell death was determined by two-color analysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (CLONTECH Laboratories) binding and propidium iodide (PI) uptake using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Cell cycle analysis and quantitation of subdiploid DNA-containing nuclei was performed by detecting PI staining after lysing the cells in HFS (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml PI) on ice for at least 30 min. Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described previously (41.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 42.Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested by gently scraping and were incubated in a buffer containing 220 mm mannitol and 60 mm sucrose on ice for 30 min. Then cells were broken in a Dounce homogenizer by 70 gentle strokes of a type B pestle. The homogenates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the mitochondria-free supernatants were frozen at −70 °C until further analysis. Extracts of the pellets as well as whole cell extracts were obtained by dissolving in lysis buffer, followed by repetitive vortexing and freeze-thawing. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g, the supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Mitochondria were freshly isolated from the liver of 2-month-old mice as described previously (41.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 42.Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17484-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the mitochondrial preparation were incubated with cytosolic extracts at 37 °C for various time periods. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatants were analyzed for the presence of cytochrome c by Western blotting. Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and were also analyzed by Western blotting. The protein content of cytosolic or whole cell extracts was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For each time point, 25 μg of total protein were boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were subjected to electrophoresis in 8% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus, followed by transfer on nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were exposed to the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C on a shaker. Before and after incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the membranes were washed extensively using phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemoluminescence (Super Signal; Pierce). Activity of effector caspases was determined in whole cell extracts using the fluorochromic caspase substrate DEVD-afc by means of a SPECTRAFluor (Tecan, Research Triangle Park, NC), as described previously (37.Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cleavage of DEVD-afc was assessed kinetically at 37 °C every 60 s for 30 min. The enzymatic activity was expressed as the maximal velocity of the resulting fluorescence-time curve. First we assessed whether adenovirus-mediated p53 expression resulted in apoptotic cell death and caspase activation in Saos-2 cells. Transduction with Ad.p53 induced phosphatidylserine externalization as detected by annexin V binding at 24 h followed by membrane disruption, leading to PI uptake starting at 36 h. No such effects were observed upon transduction with the same particle number of the empty Ad vector cassette (Fig.1 A). Similarly, an increase in subdiploid DNA content, indicating internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, was only observed in Saos-2 cells transduced with Ad.p53 but not in Saos-2 cells transduced with Ad (Fig. 1 B). Caspase activity leading to cleavage of DEVD-afc was detected in extracts from Saos-2 cells obtained at 24, 36, and 48 h after transduction with Ad.p53 (Fig.2 A). Immunoblotting demonstrated loss of procaspase 9, cleavage of procaspase 3, and cleavage of the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and protein kinase C-δ. Expression of p53 protein as well as induction of the p53 target gene p21/WAF1/CIP1 could be detected as early as 12 h after transduction (Fig. 2 B). Next, testing was conducted to determine if the apoptotic cell death observed after p53 expression in Saos-2 cells was dependent on caspase activity. The addition of the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk at a concentration of 100 μm almost completely abrogated cell death (Fig.3 A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3 B), as induced by expression of wt p53 in Saos-2 cells. Several mitochondrial genes potentially generating reactive oxygen species were reported to be induced by p53 overexpression (15.Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2246) Google Scholar), implicating a role of reactive oxygen species as downstream effectors of p53-mediated apoptosis. However, in Saos-2 cells, the addition ofN-acetylcysteine up to concentrations of 10 mmhad no protective effect against p53-induced cell death (Fig.3 A). Moreover, N-acetylcysteine at concentrations of 20 mm or above induced necrotic cell death in Saos-2 cells (data not shown). To assess whether p53 activates caspases by inducing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol (26.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 43.Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar), subcellular fractionation of Saos-2 cells was performed at various time points following transduction with Ad.p53 or with Ad. Cytochrome crelease into the cytosolic fraction of Saos-2 cells could be detected as early as 12 h after transduction with Ad.p53; this corresponded with a depletion of the mitochondria-containing pellet fraction from cytochrome c (Fig.4 A). No such effect could be observed after transduction of Saos-2 cells with vector alone (Fig.4 B). Similar kinetics of mitochondrial cytochromec release were observed after adenoviral expression of wt p53 in the p53null human lung cancer cell line Calu-6 (data not shown). The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, which induces mitochondrial cytochrome c release (44.Jürgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 48.Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), is reported to be transcriptionally activated by p53 in some human cell lines (13.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In concordance, an increase of Bax protein expression was found in Saos-2 cells following p53 overexpression, but significantly elevated Bax levels were detected only after the onset of cytochrome crelease (Fig. 4 A). Ligation of death receptors such as CD95/Fas/APO-1 or tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 also can result in cytochrome c release via activation of caspase 8, followed by cleavage and activation of Bid. Cleaved Bid can then target mitochondria and induce the release of cytochrome c (29.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 30.Li H. Zhou H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar, 31.Gross A. Yin X.-M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). However, Bid cleavage in death receptor-independent apoptosis as induced by etoposide has been shown to occur downstream of mitochondrial cytochrome c release and was prevented by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (46.Sun X.-M. McFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To address whether the p53-mediated cytochrome c release observed in our system was dependent on the caspase 8 cleavage of Bid, we again applied the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, which at a concentration of 1 μm is equally potent against effector caspases such as caspases 3 and 7 and against activator caspases such as caspases 8, 9, and 10 in vitro (47.Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar); the addition of 100 μm zVAD-fmk directly after transduction with Ad.p53 did not prevent mitochondrial cytochrome c release (Fig.4 B). Since caspase activity is required for Bid cleavage and activation via the death receptor FADD-caspase 8 pathway, this rules out a role for this pathway in p53-induced cytochrome crelease from mitochondria in Saos-2 cells. To further characterize the mechanism of p53-induced cytochrome c release, cytosolic extracts from Saos-2 cells either transduced with Ad.p53 or with the empty Ad vector were prepared and incubated with freshly isolated murine liver mitochondria. Only extracts from cells expressing wt p53 contained a cytochrome c-releasing activity in vitro, which was not inhibited by addition of zVAD-fmk (Fig.5 A), also ruling out the requirement of caspase activity for the in vitro cytochromec release by p53. When p53 was immunodepleted from the cytosolic extract, the cytochrome c-releasing activity was still retained (Fig. 5 B). This argued against a direct effect of p53 on mitochondria in our in vitro system. As p53 has been described to transactivate the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax in some cell types (13.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), which was shown to induce cytochrome c release when added to isolated mitochondria (36.Soengas M.S. Alarcón R.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), the role of Bax in this in vitro system of p53-mediated cytochrome c release was further investigated. Immunodepletion of Bax, but not of p53 or of the control antigen JNK1, abolished the cytochrome c-releasing activity from the extract of p53 overexpressing cells. (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the cytochrome c-releasing activity of p53 was dependent on the presence of Bax in the cytosol. From current understanding, there are two pathways transducing a death signal to the apoptotic machinery. The “extrinsic” pathway involves trimerization of death receptors such as CD95/Fas/APO-1 or TNF receptor 1 by binding of their respective ligands, which leads to recruitment of the activator caspase 8 via adapter molecules like FADD and TRADD and to its autoactivation (49.Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). Activated caspase 8 either can directly cleave and activate the effector caspases (50.Muzio M.

This caspase-dependent activation of the mitochondrial pathway may be important in cells with low concentrations of death receptors or caspase 8 and might act as an amplification loop (42.Bossy-Wetzel E.

In contrast, the death receptor-independent, intrinsic, apoptotic pathway is directly activated by a death signal, leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol, which then, in the presence of ATP, facilitates oligomerization and activation of Apaf-1 and caspase 9, leading to activation of caspase 3 and other effector caspases (24.Green D.R.

Many inducers of apoptosis, such as γ-irradiation, anticancer drugs, staurosporine, and growth factor withdrawal, were shown to activate apoptotic cell death independent of death receptor pathways, thus presumably directly activating this intrinsic apoptotic pathway (34.Fuchs E.J.

Furthermore, mice deficient in Apaf-1 or caspase 9, which in the intrinsic pathway act downstream of mitochondrial cytochromec release, show severe developmental defects leading to embryonic lethality, and their cells are resistant to death receptor-independent induction of apoptosis by radiation and a variety of anticancer drugs (58.Cecconi F.

Whereas the mitochondrial and the downstream events in the intrinsic pathway are well elaborated, the understanding of the events upstream of mitochondria in this pathway is incomplete. A number of studies implies a central role of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in the integration of a death signal to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (11.Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 957-967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar, 12.Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T.

Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), using murine embryonic fibroblasts, provided evidence that apoptotic cell death as induced by oncogenic transformation requires wt p53 as well as Apaf-1 and caspase 9 (36.Soengas M.S. Alarcón R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 appears to transduce a signal to the apoptotic machinery downstream of mitochondria. However, the link between p53 activation and the postmitochondrial apoptotic machinery still remained to be clarified. We reasoned that p53 might be able to activate effector caspases by inducing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. To address this hypothesis, we selected the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 based on its p53null status and its ability to undergo cell death upon p53 expression. This allowed us to study whether p53 activation alone may lead to mitochondrial cytochrome c release. An alternative approach could have been to use external triggers of apoptosis, such as anticancer drugs or radiation; however, these might simultaneously initiate several p53-dependent and -independent pathways in cancer cell lines, which could interfere with more detailed analysis of the p53-exclusive pathway. In addition to their p53 deficiency, Saos-2 cells also express a functionally defective, truncated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which might be one explanation for the absence of a pronounced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase following expression of wt p53 (data not shown). Thus, it cannot be excluded that the apoptosis of Saos-2 cells, as induced by p53 expression, in part results from the absence of functional pRb. Solely by expressing wt p53 in a p53null background we could induce classical apoptotic cell death in Saos-2 cells, which was prevented by caspase inhibitors. Cell fractionation experiments for the first time provided biochemical evidence for the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c prior to the activation of caspases by p53. Death receptors such as CD95/Fas/APO-1 or tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, by caspase 8 cleavage of Bid, can also induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release (29.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 30.Li H. Zhou H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

However, in our system the release of cytochrome c as induced by p53 neither in vivo nor in vitro was dependent on caspase activity, thus formally ruling out the involvement of a death receptor pathway. Cleavage and activation of caspase 8 and Bid, which can be observed in response to p53-dependent apoptotic stimuli, therefore must occur downstream of caspase 3 activation via the cytochrome c-Apaf-1-caspase 9 pathway (46.Sun X.-M.

Whereas no evidence was found for a direct effect of p53 itself on isolated mitochondria in vitro, by immunodepletion we could demonstrate the requirement of cytosolic Bax for the cytochromec-releasing activity of p53. Based on our results and the results of others (36.Soengas M.S. Alarcón R.M. Yoshida H. Giaccia A.J. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Lowe S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), we propose the following model for the induction of apoptosis by p53. Upon activation, p53 induces the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c by a pathway involving cytosolic Bax. Cytosolic cytochrome cfacilitates the activation of caspase 3 and other effector caspases by caspase 9 oligomerization with the adapter molecule Apaf-1 in the presence of ATP.

In particular, we find that the mechanism lying at the heart of the synchronization process is the period doubling of the clapping rhythm. The characteristic interplay between synchronized and unsynchronized regimes during the applause is the result of a frustration in the systems.

These kinases mediate cellular responses to stresses such as DNA damage and nutrient deprivation in a variety of eukaryotes from yeast to humans. FRAP regulates G1cell cycle progression and translation initiation in part by controlling the phosphorylation states of a number of translational and cell cycle regulators. Although FRAP is known to be phosphorylatedin vivo and to phosphorylate several proteins (including itself) in vitro, FRAP's phosphorylation sites and substrate specificity are unknown. We report here the identification of a FRAP autophosphorylation site. This site, Ser-2481, is located in a hydrophobic region near the conserved carboxyl-terminal FRAP tail. We demonstrate that the COOH-terminal tail is required for FRAP kinase activity and for signaling to the translational regulator p70s6k (ribosomal subunit S6 kinase).

Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The importance of FRAP in cell cycle progression appears to be conserved in most eukaryotic cells including yeast, where inhibition of FRAP homologs Tor1p and Tor2p by rapamycin treatment also results in G1 cell cycle arrest (1.Dennis P.B. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). FRAP may exert its influence over cell cycle progression by indirect regulation of the phosphorylation states of a number of proteins including translational regulators such as the ribosomal subunit S6 kinase (p70s6k) (2.Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and the eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) (3.Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The binding of FKBP-rapamycin to FRAP causes rapid dephosphorylation of p70s6k and 4E-BP1, resulting in decreased translation of mRNA transcripts possessing polypyrimidine tracts or extensive secondary structure in their 5′- untranslated regions (4.Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Rapamycin treatment also affects translation in yeast, decreasing protein synthesis to about 10% of untreated levels (5.Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).FRAP possesses a kinase domain with significant sequence similarity to the lipid kinases, and the known functions of FRAP depend upon FRAP kinase activity. Rapamycin-resistant FRAP point mutants are able to protect p70s6k and 4E-BP1 from rapamycin-induced, FRAP-responsive dephosphorylation, but rapamycin-resistant mutants that are kinase-inactive do not offer this protection (2.Brown E.J.

In yeast, the known rapamycin-inhibitable functions of Tor1p and Tor2p all depend upon an intact kinase domain, as does the rapamycin-resistant, cell cycle-independent essential function of Tor2p (7.Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Although the FRAP kinase domain is closely related to the phosphatidylinositol kinases (PIKs), no lipid kinase activity has been detected, and it appears that FRAP possesses serine/threonine protein kinase activity. Direct phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by FRAP or an associated kinase has been demonstrated in vitro (6.Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation occurs at Thr-37 and Thr-46, two residues followed by prolines that are known to be phosphorylated in vivo (9.Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). FRAP has also been reported to phosphorylate a bacterially expressed fragment of p70s6k at Thr-389, a site known to be dephosphorylated in vivo upon rapamycin treatment (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Thr-389 is surrounded by bulky, hydrophobic residues, and phosphorylation of Thr-389 is reported to be more efficient than the somewhat weak phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 proline-directed sites (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Because FRAP can phosphorylate these translational regulators in vitro, it has been proposed that FRAP is the mitogen-stimulated kinase responsible for the mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70s6k. However, serum stimulation causes a greater than 20-fold activation of p70s6k, but the in vitro kinase activity of FRAP toward 4E-BP1 is increased only 2–4-fold under similar conditions (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 10.Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A.

The kinases that phosphorylate rapamycin-sensitive sites on p70s6k remain active under conditions of FRAP inhibition (11.Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and PP2A associates with p70s6k but not with a rapamycin-resistant p70s6k mutant (14.Peterson R.T.

Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, it seems likely that regulation of PP2A is a significant part of FRAP's function.Although FRAP kinase activity is critical for FRAP function, little is known about how FRAP activity is regulated. Because mitogenic stimuli, especially those mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), affect p70s6k and 4E-BP1 activity, it has been proposed that mitogens regulate FRAP activity in vivo (6.Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). FRAP is also posited to be a sensor of cellular amino acid levels, permitting translation when amino acids are abundant and preventing translation of specific mRNA transcripts when amino acids are scarce (17.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Like rapamycin treatment, amino acid deprivation causes rapid dephosphorylation of p70s6k and 4E-BP1, and a rapamycin-resistant truncation of p70s6k is also resistant to amino acid deprivation-induced dephosphorylation (17.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Therefore, like other PIK-related kinases including ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, FRAP may serve as a checkpoint protein by sensing intracellular abnormalities and transmitting signals to halt cell cycle progression (18.Kuruvilla F.G. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R129-R136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, identification of the factors that regulate FRAP activity has been complicated by the lack of a robust assay of FRAP activity in vivo. Purified 4E-BP1 has been used as a substrate for assaying FRAP kinase activity in vitro, but cell treatments that cause dramatic changes in p70s6k activity have only minor or negligible effects on the in vitro activity of FRAP (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar,10.Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), possibly because immunoprecipitation and washing of FRAP remove factors that regulate FRAP activity in vivo. A more direct assay of FRAP in vivo activity may prove useful in determining the mechanism of FRAP regulation.FRAP autophosphorylates in vitro and is phosphorylatedin vivo (2.Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation is a common feature of protein kinases, often serving as a marker for kinase activity. Autophosphorylation can also play an important role in kinase regulation, altering not only kinase catalytic activity but also specificity for allosteric effectors, proteolysis, membrane association, and binding to other proteins (19.Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a FRAP autophosphorylation site and generation of phosphospecific antibodies that allow direct detection of FRAP phosphorylation in vivo. We also report initial efforts to assess the phosphorylation of FRAP under various cellular conditions and demonstrate that the Ser-2481 autokinase activity of FRAP is not inhibited under translationally repressive conditions.DISCUSSIONThe PIK-related kinases have emerged as key regulators of cellular responses to DNA damage and nutrient deprivation. Despite indications that the kinase activity of these proteins is required for their cellular functions and that, at least in the case of DNA-PK, phosphorylation regulates function (30.Chan D.W. Lees-Miller S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8936-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), no phosphorylation sites have been identified for any PIK-related kinase, possibly because of technical difficulties caused by their large size. The identification of Ser-2481 as a FRAP autophosphorylation site in vitro andin vivo provides new insight about FRAP kinase activity under growth conditions and under conditions inhibitory to growth. Autophosphorylation has been observed in numerous protein kinases. In some cases, the significance of autophosphorylation remains unknown, whereas in others, autophosphorylation regulates kinase proteolysis, membrane localization, binding to other proteins, substrate specificity, and catalytic activity (19.Smith J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127–128: 51-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of FRAP, the consequences of autophosphorylation are not yet known. Mutation of Ser-2481 to alanine or glutamate does not appear to have any effect on p70s6k activity nor to abolish completely FRAP autokinase activity. However, it is possible that autophosphorylation at this site influences a separate, untested FRAP function. Whether autophosphorylation plays a significant role in FRAP function or simply serves as a marker for FRAP kinase activity in cells (see below), identification of an autophosphorylation site has allowed increased understanding of FRAP's in vivo kinase activity and the regulation of FRAP's function.Ser-2481 is surrounded by bulky, hydrophobic residues, possibly revealing a preference for phosphorylation of such sites by FRAP. The five 4E-BP1 sites reported to be phosphorylated by FRAP in vitro are not bulky, hydrophobic sites but are all Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro sites (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 9.Gingras A.C. Gygi S.P. Raught B. Polakiewicz R.D. Abraham R.T. Hoekstra M.F. Aebersold R. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1422-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 31.Brunn G.J. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32547-32550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, a comparison between FRAP phosphorylation of these sites and a bulky, hydrophobic site derived from p70s6k suggests a strong preference for phosphorylation of bulky, hydrophobic sites in vitro (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). The nature of the FRAP Ser-2481 autophosphorylation site is consistent with this preference. It has been noted that the sequence surrounding Ser-2481 is similar to the sequences surrounding the activation loop phosphorylation sites in the catalytic domains of the AGC kinases (32.Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R248-R250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these kinases, including p70s6k, c-Akt/PKB, and protein kinase C are believed to be involved in the FRAP signaling pathway. The significance, if any, of the sequence similarity between these activation loops and the FRAP autophosphorylation site is unknown. Perhaps these phosphorylated sequences are recognized by a common phosphatase or binding protein, but it appears unlikely that the AGC kinase activation loops are FRAP substrates because another kinase, PDK1, is responsible for AGC kinase activation loop phosphorylation (33.Belham C. Wu S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).FRAP autophosphorylation may share some features with the autophosphorylation of PI3K p110δ reported recently (23.Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both FRAP and PI3K p110δ autophosphorylate on serines located comparable distances COOH-terminal to the catalytic domains; Ser-1039 of PI3K is located 128 amino acids COOH-terminal to the catalytic DFG aspartate of its kinase domain, and Ser-2481 of FRAP is located 124 amino acids COOH-terminal to its homologous catalytic aspartate (Fig.2 C). Autophosphorylation of PI3K has been proposed to inhibit its lipid kinase activity while leaving the protein kinase activity of PI3K p110δ intact (23.Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus autophosphorylation may convert PI3K p110δ from a kinase with lipid and protein specificity to a kinase with specificity for protein substrates only. No lipid kinase activity has yet been observed for any of the PIK-related kinases, despite their homology to the lipid kinases. As more is learned about autophosphorylation of PI3K and FRAP, it will be interesting to discover if the structural similarity of their autophosphorylation sites reflects any functional similarity between the two kinases.PI3K terminates just a few amino acids COOH-terminal to its autophosphorylation site, whereas FRAP extends beyond its autophosphorylation site in a COOH-terminal tail that we demonstrate to be absolutely critical for FRAP kinase activity and function. Other PIK-related kinases appear to be similarly intolerant of COOH-terminal truncations or additions. Naturally occurring mutations resulting in COOH-terminal truncations or additions to the mammalian PIK-related kinases DNA-PK and ATM result in severe combined immune deficiency (34.Blunt T. Gell D. Fox M. Taccioli G.E. Lehmann A.R. Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10285-10290Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and ataxia telangiectasia disease phenotypes (35.Concannon P. Gatti R.A. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), respectively.FRAP is known to mediate rather pronounced changes in the phosphorylation and activity of 4E-BP1 and p70s6k upon rapamycin treatment (4.Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It has been widely accepted that rapamycin inactivates FRAP by inhibiting its kinase activity. FRAP autokinase activity and intermolecular kinase activity have been shown to be inhibited by the FKBP12-rapamycin complex in vitro, although the extent of inhibition has been disputed (2.Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 6.Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). We now show thatin vivo, FRAP autophosphorylation of Ser-2481 is not inhibited detectably by rapamycin treatment. Ser-2481 phosphorylation appears to be completely dependent upon FRAP kinase activity; kinase-inactive FRAP is not phosphorylated at Ser-2481 in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, the absence of change in Ser-2481 phosphorylation after rapamycin treatment suggests that FRAP autokinase activity is intact. (It should be noted that phosphoserine 2481 is a substrate for cellular phosphatases in vivoas judged by our experiments with calyculin A. Therefore, if FKBP12-rapamycin inhibits the kinase activity of FRAP, previously phosphorylated Ser-2481 would be expected to be dephosphorylated.) In contrast, wortmannin treatment causes the complete dephosphorylation of Ser-2481, suggesting that wortmannin disrupts FRAP autokinase activity. Wortmannin-induced FRAP inactivation may be an indirect consequence of PI3K inhibition, but this seems unlikely because wortmannin concentrations in the range of the PI3K IC50 (2–5 nm) do not inhibit FRAP Ser-2481 phosphorylation (data not shown). A more likely possibility is that in vivo, wortmannin inhibits FRAP kinase activity directly as has been shownin vitro (24.Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar).It is not altogether surprising that rapamycin does not significantly inhibit FRAP kinase activity in vivo given the nonequivalence of rapamycin-treated and kinase-inactive Tor2p in yeast. Kinase-inactive Tor2p is unable to carry out its cell cycle-independent essential function, but this function remains intact upon rapamycin treatment (7.Zheng X.F. Florentino D. Chen J. Crabtree G.R. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 121-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Just as rapamycin treatment is not equivalent to kinase inactivation of Tor2p in yeast, rapamycin treatment and amino acid deprivation have effects on Ser-2481 autophosphorylation which are not equivalent to FRAP kinase inactivation. This does not mean, however, that rapamycin does not inhibit FRAP function. Rather, it suggests that rapamycin influences FRAP function through some mechanism other than direct kinase inhibition. Given that rapamycin does not disrupt FRAP's intrinsic kinase activity, how does rapamycin inhibit FRAP function? A number of possibilities exist, including the possibility that the FKBP12-rapamycin complex alters FRAP localization or disrupts association between FRAP and a subset of its regulatory proteins or kinase substrates. If amino acid deprivation inhibits FRAP function as has been proposed (17.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), it is likely to do so by a mechanism similar to that of FKBP12-rapamycin inhibition, likely involving the FRB domain of FRAP, because amino acid deprivation also has little effect on FRAP autophosphorylation.FRAP also retains autokinase activity upon serum deprivation. FRAP autophosphorylation in quiescent HEK293 cells is much greater than that observed from kinase-inactive or wortmannin-treated FRAP and is only increased slightly upon serum stimulation. It is possible that the actual serum-induced increase in FRAP kinase activity is quite pronounced in vivo but is not observed because of saturation of the intramolecular substrate. However, this seems unlikely because this in vivo result is consistent with earlier in vitro results showing that FRAP immunoprecipitated from serum-stimulated cells is only about 2- or 3-fold more active toward 4E-BP1 than FRAP immunoprecipitated from serum-deprived cells (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar,10.Scott P.H. Brunn G.J. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).Serum deprivation inactivates p70s6k almost completely, and serum stimulation activates p70s6k by greater than 20-fold, whereas serum effects on FRAP activity are much less pronounced and seem to occur more slowly than effects on p70s6k (8.Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1432-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that some factor other than FRAP is primarily responsible for direct serum-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70s6k. This idea is supported by the observation that a p70s6k mutant that is unresponsive to FRAP regulation is still sensitive to the effects of serum deprivation and stimulation (12.Cheatham L. Monfar M. Chou M.M. Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11696-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13.Weng Q.P. Andrabi K. Kozlowski M.T. Grove J.R. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDK1, a rapamycin-resistant, serum-responsive, PIP3-dependent protein kinase, has been shown to phosphorylate one of the rapamycin-sensitive sites on p70s6k (36.Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 37.Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar) and may also be responsible for phosphorylation of other rapamycin-sensitive sites (38.Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).If changes in FRAP kinase activity do not correlate directly with 4E-BP1 and p70s6k phosphorylation, how does rapamycin treatment cause such pronounced dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70s6k? It seems that this is achieved to a significant degree through FRAP regulation of a serine/threonine phosphatase. FRAP inhibition increases the activity of the phosphatase PP2A by an unknown mechanism, although FRAP may phosphorylate PP2A directly (14.Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In yeast, Tor2p can phosphorylate the phosphatase regulator Tap42p (16.Jiang Y. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2782-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and rapamycin treatment causes dissociation of Tap42p and the phosphatase Sit4p (39.DiComo C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Association between the mammalian Tap42p homolog (α4) and several phosphatases has been demonstrated and may be rapamycin-sensitive, although this point remains controversial (40.Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,41.Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Whether FRAP regulates phosphatase activity through phosphorylation or by some other means is unknown, but the involvement of a phosphatase in FRAP signaling may explain how FRAP-mediated dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70s6k can occur without inhibition of intrinsic FRAP kinase activity.This study underscores the complexity of the FRAP signaling pathway and the inadequacy of linear kinase cascades in describing FRAP signaling. Although FRAP kinase activity is affected somewhat by mitogenic stimulation, FRAP is not simply a serum-induced kinase whose activity reflects the presence or absence of a given mitogen. Rather, FRAP appears able to mediate protein dephos"
https://openalex.org/W1969388212,"Pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors, particularly SB203580, have been widely used to elucidate the roles of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (p38/HOG/SAPKII) in a wide array of biological systems. Studies by this group and others have shown that SB203580 can have antiproliferative activity on cytokine-activated lymphocytes. However, we recently reported that the antiproliferative effects of SB203580 were unrelated to p38 MAP kinase activity. This present study now shows that SB203580 can inhibit the key cell cycle event of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation in interleukin-2-stimulated T cells. Studies on the proximal regulator of this event, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PKB)(Akt/Rac) kinase pathway, showed that SB203580 blocked the phosphorylation and activation of PKB by inhibiting the PKB kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1. The concentrations of SB203580 required to block PKB phosphorylation (IC50 3–5 μm) are only approximately 10-fold higher than those required to inhibit p38 MAP kinase (IC50 0.3–0.5 μm). These data define a new activity for this drug and would suggest that extreme caution should be taken when interpreting data where SB203580 has been used at concentrations above 1–2 μm.

Several intracellular signaling pathways are known to be activated by IL-2, including the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase, also known as ERK2/1), the p38 and p54 MAP kinases (also called stress kinases, or HOG and JNK, respectively), the phosphatidyl inositol 3′ (PI) 3-kinase pathway and the Jak/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathways.

In contrast, a pyridinyl imidazole inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SB203580, inhibited IL-2-driven T cell proliferation with an IC50 of 3–5 μm, suggesting a possible role for p38 MAP kinase in this process (4.Crawley J.B.

Recently, we have further investigated the role of p38 MAP kinase in proliferation by mapping the subdomains of the IL-2 receptor β chain involved in the activation of the kinase.

Surprisingly, SB203580 was still able to inhibit proliferation in the absence of IL-2 stimulated p38 MAP kinase activation. It has already been reported that SB203580 does inhibit p54 MAP kinase activity (8.Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.H. Su M.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar,9.Clerk A. Sugden P.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but the possibility that the anti-proliferative effects of SB203580 may be mediated by effects on p54 MAP kinase can also be discounted by the studies of Hunt et al. (5.Hunt A.E. Lali F.V. Lord J.D. Nelson B.H. Miyazaki T. Tracey K.J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7591-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The above data suggest the existence of a novel target of SB203580 that is critical for mitogenic signaling. To help understand the mechanism of action and possible targets of SB203580, the effect of this inhibitor on cell cycle-regulated proteins was examined. We found that the IL-2-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rb was greatly reduced in SB203580-treated cells, whereas the drug had no effect on cytokine-induced p27kip degradation or Myc expression. Subsequent studies investigated the effects of SB203580 on PI 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PKB), as these kinases have been implicated in the regulation of Rb phosphorylation (10.Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). We observed that although PI 3-kinase activity was unaffected, the phosphorylation of PKB on Thr308 and Ser473 was inhibited, resulting in an inhibition of IL-2-induced kinase activity. The concentrations of SB203580 required were commensurate with antiproliferative effects of the drug and provide evidence that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1; the Thr308 kinase) is inhibited by SB203580. It has recently been reported that PDK1 also acts as the Ser473 kinase (11.Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These results could provide a mechanism for the antiproliferative effect of SB203580. Furthermore these data will have important implications for the interpretation of results from numerous published studies in which SB203580 has been used at concentrations in excess of 2 μm. IL-2 was a generous gift from Dr. P. Lomedico (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antiphospho-specific Ser473 and Thr308 PKB were from New England Biolabs (Hitchin, Herts, UK), whereas sheep anti-PKB and other reagents for in vitroPKB kinase assay were sold as a kit by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.

Rabbit antisera to p38 MAP kinase was from Professor J. Saklatvala (Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, London). Second-layer antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) were purchased from DAKO (DAKO A/S Denmark). Recombinant PDK1 and recombinant PKB were kindly provided by Dr. L. Stephens (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK) and Dr. D. Alessi (Dundee, UK). CN1-1493 was from Dr. K. Tracey (Picower Institute of Medical Research New York). The IL-2-dependent murine T cell line, CT6, was grown and maintained as described previously (12.Willcocks J.L. Hales A. Page T.H. Foxwell B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These cells were rested by washing three times in RPMI and culturing overnight in RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum in the absence of growth factor, antibiotics, or β-mercaptoethanol supplements. 2–5 × 106 rested CT6 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum and preincubated with inhibitors or vehicle control as indicated in figure legends. Cells were then stimulated with 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-2 for 5 min at 37 °C and pelleted in a minifuge for 30 s, medium was aspirated, and the pellet was lysed in the appropriate buffer. BA/F3 cells stably expressing deletion mutants of IL-2 receptor β chain (a generous gift from Professor T. Taniguchi, Tokyo, Japan) were maintained in glutamine containing RPMI further supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.2 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) as described previously (13.Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were prepared from buffy coat leukophoresis residues (North London Blood Transfusion Service, Colindale, London UK) and activated with 50 ng/ml OKT3 for 48 h. The cells were then washed extensively, rested overnight, and washed again before activating with IL-2; such cell preparations were >90% T cells (14.Page T.H. Lali F.V. Groome N. Foxwell B.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5727-5735PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular proliferation assays were performed by measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (12.Willcocks J.L. Hales A. Page T.H. Foxwell B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Buffer A (see below) for Western blotting and PKB kinase assays. Kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 4 μg of sheep anti-PKBα was immobilized on 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose overnight (or 1.5 h) and washed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and 1 μm microcystin). The immobilized anti-PKB was then incubated with 0.5 ml of lysate (from 5 × 106 cells) for 1.5 h and washed three times in 0.5 ml of Buffer A supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl, two times in 0.5 ml of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (w/v) Brij-35, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), and twice with 100 μl of assay dilution buffer; 5× assay dilution buffer is 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 125 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm DTT. To the PKB enzyme immune complex was added 10 μl of assay dilution buffer, 40 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 100 μm PKB-specific substrate peptide, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, all made up in assay dilution buffer. The reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature with shaking, then samples were pulse spun, and 40 μl of reaction volume were removed into another tube to which was added 20 μl of 40% trichloroacetic acid to stop the reaction. This was mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and 40 μl was transferred onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and allowed to bind for 30 s. The P81 pieces were washed three times in 0.75% phosphoric acid then in acetone at room temperature. γ-32P incorporation was then measured by scintillation counting. Cells were lysed in PI 3-kinase lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin) at 10 × 106cells/ml, and the post-nuclear lysate was precleared with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h then preincubated with 5 μg of monoclonal anti-p85α (U5) and further with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose for the final 1 h. The pellets were washed three times in 0.5 ml of PI 3-kinase assay buffer. The pellet was then resuspended in 25 μl of kinase assay buffer. To this, 10 μl of a 1 mg/ml mixture of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (made up in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and sonicated just before use) was added. The mixture was then preincubated at room temperature for 10 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of 15 μl of ATP mixture (340 μl of water, 4.2 μl of 1 mMgCl2, 16 μl of 100 mm ATP) supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction proceeded for 15 min and was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl and vortexing, adding a further 200 μl of a 1:1 chloroform:methanol and vortexing again, and microfuge-spinning the tubes for 5 min. The lower layer was removed and dried in vacuo (or at 60 °C on dry block) then redissolved in 10 μl of 4:1 chloroform:methanol before spotting onto silica plates. The plate was developed in a preequilibrated vertical tank with chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonium hydroxide, water (180:140:10.8:27.5) for 3 h (or overnight) followed by phosphorimaging analysis (Fuji FLA-2000). Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of p70S6 kinase lysis buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.05, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin), and the postnuclear lysate was precleared with 20 μl of protein A-agarose for 30 min. The precleared supernatant was then preincubated with 5 μl of rabbit antiserum to p70S6 kinase for 1 h and additionally with 25 μl of protein A-agarose with mixing for a further 1 h, all at 4 °C. The final immune complex was washed twice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and twice in 0.5 ml of kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm DTT, 30 mm ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate). To washed immune complex pellet was added 45 μl of assay mixture (made up of 35 μl of kinase assay buffer, 5 μl of 125 mm substrate peptide (KKRNRTLTK), 5 μl of 50 μm protein kinase A inhibitor, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), and the reaction was allowed to continue for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of reducing sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. After separation on a peptide gel as described before (15.Crawley J.B. Williams L.M. Mander T. Brennan F.M. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16357-16362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), radioactivity incorporated into peptide was quantitated by phosphorimaging. Lipid vesicles were made by drying down a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserinein vacuo and reconstituting with lipid buffer (0.2m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA) to a final 5 times working stock (500 μmphosphatidylcholine, 500 μm phosphatidylserine, and 100 μm phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and sonicated before use. EE-tagged recombinant PDK1 and PKBα (both >98% pure) were prediluted in enzyme dilution buffer (1 mm DTT, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES). PDK1 assays were performed with 1 μm EE-PKB and 50 nm EE-PDK1 in the presence of appropriately diluted lipid vesicles, 0.5 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in assay buffer (8 mmMgCl2, 0.12 m NaCl, 1.2 mm DTT, 1.2 mm EGTA, 0.01% azide) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) in a final volume of 5 μl. The reaction was allowed to continue for 5 min at 30 °C and stopped by boiling with 10 μl of 1.5 times SDS sample buffer (with 5 mm EDTA). The PKB autokinase assays were performed as above for PDK1 but in the absence of PDK1 and PIP3. Samples were then resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and quantitated by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA-2000). After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were then blocked with 5% (w/v) milk powder in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (0.1%) for 1 h at room temperature. The blocked membranes were then incubated in 1:1000 dilution of first-stage antibody (made up in Tris-buffered saline Tween, 2% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 0.1% azide) overnight, then washed and incubated with 1:1000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (made up in Tris-buffered saline Tween, 5% (w/v) milk powder) for 1 h at room temperature before developing with ECL. As we have shown previously (4.Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol.

However, as our recent studies (5.Hunt A.E. Lali F.V. Lord J.D. Nelson B.H. Miyazaki T. Tracey K.J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7591-7597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) showed that IL-2-induced proliferation and the inhibitory effects of SB203580 on this event were independent of p38 MAP kinase or even p54 MAP kinase activity in both T cells and B cells, we endeavored to identify other possible targets involved in mediating the anti-proliferative effects. To do this, we investigated events associated with cell cycle progression. SB203580 had no effect on Myc expression, except for a small reduction at 30 μm only (Fig. 2 a). Furthermore, nuclear staining of SB203580-treated CT6 cells with propidium iodide showed no evidence of apoptosis after stimulation with IL-2 for 20 h (data not shown). The expression of hyperphosphorylated Rb and degradation of p27kip1 were also measured as markers of S-phase entry. The addition of IL-2 to resting CT6 cells caused the hyperphosphorylation of Rb as detected by Western blotting (Fig.2 b). The presence of SB203580 in the antiproliferative (0–30 μm) range resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the hyperphosphorylated form (Fig. 2 b). There also appeared to be some reduction in the total levels of Rb protein. Similar inhibitory effects on Rb hyperphosphorylation and protein levels were obtained with wortmannin and LY294002, both inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. The decrease in Rb protein is likely to be due to the IL-1-converting enzyme (ICE)-mediated proteolysis of the hypophosphorylated form, which has been previously reported (16.Janicke R.U. Walker P.A. Lin X.Y. Porter A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 17.Dou Q.P. An B. Antoku K. Johnson D.E. J. Cell.

These results would also agree with previous studies on the role of PI 3-kinase in IL-2-induced Rb hyperphosphorylation and protein by Brennanet al. (10.Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and would support previous indications that PI 3-kinase is a proximal regulator of Rb (10.Brennan P.

The effects of SB203580 on Rb hyperphosphorylation were confirmed in similar studies on activated primary human T cells (Fig. 2 d).Figure 2Effect of SB203580 on cell cycle proteins. Resting CT6 cells (a, b,c) and PBMC (d and e) were preincubated with the indicated doses of SB203580, wortmannin, LY294002, or vehicle control for 1 h before stimulating with 20 ng/ml IL-2 or vehicle control for 3 h (c-Myc) or 20 h (Rb and p27kip). Cells were then lysed and prepared for total cellular c-Myc (a) Rb (b and d) or p27kip (c and e) measurement by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data are representative of three separate experiments. pRb, hypophosphorylated; ppRb, hyperphosphorylated Rb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also investigated a second cell cycle-regulated protein, p27kip1. The addition of IL-2 to resting CT6 cells induces the degradation of p27kip1(Fig. 2 c). This degradation was unaffected by SB203580, which if anything, further reduced levels of the protein. Wortmannin and LY294002 similarly had no inhibitory effect on p27kip1 degradation. Again, these studies on p27kip1 degradation were repeated in activated primary human T cells, with no significant inhibition observed with SB203580 or wortmannin, although LY294002 had some inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 e). The characteristic, S-phase hyperphosphorylation of Rb induced by IL-2 has been reported to be mediated by the PI 3-kinase pathway via the distal effector PKB (10.Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both the mitogenic and survival functions of the PI 3-kinase pathway have, in several reports, been attributed to PKB (10.Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M. Groner B. Reif K.

We were therefore interested in investigating the possibility that SB203580 mediates its effects on Rb by inhibiting these kinases, especially as wortmannin and LY294002 displayed similar effects. The activation of PKB requires the PI 3-kinase-generated second messenger PIP3 as well as phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 mediated by the PIP3-dependent kinases, PDK1 and PDK2, respectively (23.Alessi D.R.

Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of SB203580 on PKB activation by looking at IL-2-induced phosphorylation of residue Ser473 of PKB in whole cell lysates using a phospho-specific antibody. In both CT6 and activated human T cells, SB203580 inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser473 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, a and b). Similar studies on the IL-2-responsive BA/F3 F7 B cells gave the same result (Fig. 3 c). The approximate IC50 for the effect of SB203580 on this parameter is ∼5 μm, similar to the concentration required for the inhibitory effects on proliferation (Fig. 1). As expected, wortmannin (Fig. 3) and LY294002 (not shown) also inhibited Ser473 phosphorylation, whereas rapamycin (not shown) had no effect. The phosphorylation of PKB on Thr308 was similarly investigated. As the antibody was not so effective, PKB was first immunoprecipitated, and phospho-Thr308 was detected by Western blotting. SB203580 inhibited Thr308 phosphorylation in CT6 cells with similar efficacy to the Ser473 phosphorylation (Fig.4). Wortmannin, as expected, also inhibited this Thr308 phosphorylation. To confirm that the effects of SB203580 on PKB phosphorylation correlated with kinase activity, assays were performed on immunoprecipitated PKB from IL-2-stimulated CT6 cells (Fig. 5). The drug inhibited PKB activation with an IC50 of 3–10 μm, in agreement with its effects on phosphorylation of the kinase and cell proliferation.Figure 4Effect of SB203580 on phosphorylation of threonine-308 on PKB. Rested CT6 were preincubated with the indicated doses of SB203580 or vehicle control for 1 h or 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min before stimulating with 20 ng/ml IL-2 or vehicle control for 5 min. Cells were then lysed, and PKB was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-PKBα antiserum or irrelevant control antibody. Threonine 308 phosphorylation was assayed by Western blotting (upper panel). Membranes were stripped and reprobed for total PKB to confirm equal loading (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5SB203580 inhibits IL-2-induced PKB activity.

(n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the above results showed that PKB activation is inhibited, it is still possible that PKB is one of several mitogenic effector molecules downstream of the actual SB203580 target. Therefore the effect of SB203580 on IL-2-induced activation of the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway was examined. Exposure of CT6 cells to IL-2 leads to a reproducible 2-fold increase in anti-p85-precipitable PI 3-kinase activity. This was unaffected by preincubating the cells with SB203580. In contrast, wortmannin totally inhibited this activity (Fig.6). Furthermore, direct addition of SB203580 to PI 3-kinase assays did not have any effect (results not shown), indicating that PI 3-kinase is not the target of the drug. The effect of SB203580 on PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway was also examined indirectly. Several studies have shown that p70S6 kinase is a distal mediator of PI 3-kinase activity in several systems (15.Crawley J.B. Williams L.M. Mander T. Brennan F.M. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol.

As expected, wortmannin (Fig. 6 b) and LY294002 (not shown) inhibited the activation of p70S6 kinase by IL-2, as measured in immunokinase assays.

https://openalex.org/W2059969460,"TAK1, a member of the mitogen-activated kinase kinase kinase family, is activated in vivo by various cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), or when ectopically expressed together with the TAK1-binding protein TAB1. However, this molecular mechanism of activation is not yet understood. We show here that endogenous TAK1 is constitutively associated with TAB1 and phosphorylated following IL-1 stimulation. Furthermore, TAK1 is constitutively phosphorylated when ectopically overexpressed with TAB1. In both cases, dephosphorylation of TAK1 renders it inactive, but it can be reactivated by preincubation with ATP. A mutant of TAK1 that lacks kinase activity is not phosphorylated either following IL-1 treatment or when coexpressed with TAB1, indicating that TAK1 phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation to alanine of a conserved serine residue (Ser-192) in the activation loop between kinase domains VII and VIII abolishes both phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 and ectopic expression of TAB1 both activate TAK1 via autophosphorylation of Ser-192.

Whereas the ERK family is activated by growth factors and is involved in cell proliferation, JNK and p38 are activated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and various types of environmental stresses. ERK family kinases are activated by the MEK1 and MEK2 MAPKKs; JNK by MKK4 and MKK7; and p38 by MKK3 and MKK6. Further upstream, Raf-1 functions as a MAPKKK in the ERK activation pathway. A subgroup of MAPKKKs including the MEKK family (MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEKK4/MTK1), the MLK family (MLK1, MLK2, MLK3, and DLK), ASK1, and TAK1 activate the MAPKKs that phosphorylate JNK and p38, but not the MAPKKs that phosphorylate ERK (5.Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Different mechanisms activate MAPKKKs. Autophosphorylation mediated by an intramolecular reaction has been implicated in the activation of MEKK1 and Ssk2, a MAPKKK in budding yeast (7.Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8.Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol.

ASK1 and MLK3 have been demonstrated to form dimers in response to upstream stimuli, an event important for their catalytic activities (10.Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11.Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This dimerization may facilitate intermolecular autophosphorylation leading to activation, as is the case for receptor tyrosine kinases. In some signaling pathways, MAPKKKs may be activated by the action of upstream MAPKKK kinases (MAPKKKKs). For example, in the budding yeast mating pheromone pathway, MAPKKKK Ste20 functions to activate MAPKKK Ste11 (12.Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Similarly, Ste20-like kinases have been implicated in the activation of MAPKKKs in mammalian cells. For example, Raf-1 is phosphorylated and activated by p21 (Rac/Cdc42)-activated kinase (13.King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Germinal center kinase functions upstream of MEKK1 in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway leading to JNK activation (14.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar); and hematopoietic progenitor kinase and hematopoietic progenitor kinase/germinal center kinase-like kinase (HGK) are involved in the activation of TAK1 that leads to JNK activation (15.Wang W.

TAK1 is a member of the MAPKKK family and is activated by various cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β family ligands and interleukin-1 (IL-1) (17.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 18.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that TAK1 functions in transforming growth factor-β signaling pathways in mammalian cells (17.Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar). In early Xenopus embryos, TAK1 also participates in mesoderm induction and patterning meditated by bone morphogenetic protein, a transforming growth factor-β family ligand (19.Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya T.J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 20.Shibuya H. Iwata H. Masuyama N. Gotoh Y. Yamaguchi K. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Ueno N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that TAK1 is involved in the IL-1 signaling pathway by activating two kinase cascades (21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar); one is a MAPK cascade leading to JNK activation, and the other is a kinase cascade composed of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inducing kinase and IκB kinases, ultimately leading to NF-κB activation. TAB1 is a mammalian protein that interacts with TAK1 and was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen (22.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). When ectopically expressed together with TAK1, TAB1 can augment the kinase activity of TAK1. The C-terminal 68-amino acid portion of TAB1 is sufficient for binding to and activation of TAK1. However, the molecular mechanism for this activation remains to be elucidated. In this report, we sought to determine the mechanism for both IL-1- and TAB1-induced activation of TAK1. We found that endogenous TAK1 associates with TAB1 constitutively and is activated by autophosphorylation following IL-1 stimulation. Similarly, ectopically expressed TAK1, once bound to TAB1, is also activated by autophosphorylation. The primary site of TAK1 autophosphorylation is Ser-192 in the kinase activation loop. Phosphorylation of this residue correlates with activation of TAK1. 293 and 293IL-1RI (23.Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The mammalian expression vectors for TAB1, N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged TAK1, and TAB1 (pEF-TAB1, pEF-HA-TAK1, pEF-HA-TAK1(K63W), and pEF-HA-TAB1) have been described previously (17.Yamaguchi K.

Several TAK1 mutants (TAK1(S192A), TAK1(S192D), and TAK1(S192E)) that contain various substitutions of a serine residue in the activation loop were generated by polymerase chain reaction. First, a 5′-oligonucleotide containing a SacI restriction site (TTGTGGAGCTCCGGCAGTTG) together with a 3′-oligonucleotide containing aNarI restriction site (TTCAGGCGCCATCCAAGCAGCAGCCCC for TAK1(S192A), TTCAGGCGCCATCCAAGCAGCATCCCC for TAK1(S192D), or TTCAGGCGCCATCCAAGCAGCTTCCCC for TAK1(S192E)) were used to generate TAK1 mutant fragments. The resulting DNA fragments were digested with SacI and NarI and subcloned into the SacI and NarI sites of pSP72-HA-TAK1, which contains an N-terminal HA epitope-tagged full-length TAK1 cDNA fragment in the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector pSP72 (Promega). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Next, the EcoRI-BamHI TAK1 mutant fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the vector pEF to generate pEF-HA-TAK1 mutants. To generate the TAK1 C-terminal truncation constructs, EcoRI-PstI fragments from pEF-HA-TAK1 or pEF-HA-TAK1(K63W), containing the N-terminal HA epitope-tagged 402 amino acids of TAK1, were inserted into the EcoRI and PstI sites of the vector pKT10 (24.Tanaka K. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to add a stop codon. Then the EcoRI-SalI fragments from the above-generated pKT10-TAK1ΔC plasmids, containing the HA epitope-tagged truncated TAK1 cDNA and a stop codon, were inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pEF vector, producing pEF-HA-TAK1ΔC and pEF-HA-TAK1ΔC(K63W). 293IL-1RI cells were either left untreated or treated with IL-1 (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. For the transfection studies, 293 or 293IL-1RI cells (1 × 106) were plated in 10-cm dishes, transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA containing various expression vectors, and incubated for 24–36 h. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.3 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μmaprotinin. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10, 000 × g for 5 min. Proteins from cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-TAK1 antibody or anti-HA antibody HA.11 (Babco) and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies to rabbit or mouse IgG using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Endogenous TAK1 or various ectopically expressed versions of HA-TAK1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 or anti-HA antibody, respectively, as described above. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with or without 1 μg of bacterially expressed MKK6 (25.Moriguchi T. Kuroyanagi N. Yamaguchi K. Gotoh Y. Irie K. Kano T. Shirakabe K. Muro Y. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. Hagiwara M. J. Biol.

Samples were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For phosphatase treatment, immunoprecipitates were incubated with λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs Inc.) in phosphatase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, and 2 mm MnCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were then washed twice with the lysis buffer described above and twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Some samples were further incubated with a unlabeled ATP buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm ATP at 37 °C for 20 min. Subsequently, samples were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. All samples were subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation assay as described above. HA-TAK1 was immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated in vitro with [γ-32P]ATP as described above. The labeled immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The phosphorylated HA-TAK1 band was identified by autoradiography, excised, and digested with CNBr (Sigma) (26.Luo K.X. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were analyzed by Tris/Tricine gel electrophoresis (20% polyacrylamide gels) (27.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Polypeptide SDS-PAGE standards (Bio-Rad) and a 1.0-kDa phosphopeptide generated by trypsin digestion of glutathioneS-transferase-tagged IκBN (IκB, amino acids 1–72) phosphorylated in vitro with IκB kinase (21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar) were used as molecular mass standards. Reporter gene activity assays were performed as described (21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). An Ig-κ/luciferase reporter was used to measure NF-κB-dependent transcription. A plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the β-actin promoter was used for normalizing transfection efficiency. To address how TAK1 is activated following IL-1 stimulation, we initially analyzed endogenous TAK1 complexes in untreated and IL-1-treated cells. 293 cells overexpressing the IL-1 receptor (293IL-1RI cells) were stimulated with IL-1, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-TAK1 antibody and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-TAK1 and anti-TAB1 antibodies (Fig.1, upper panel). TAK1 kinase activity was also measured in vitro using bacterially expressed MKK6 as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 1, lower panel). TAK1 was activated upon IL-1 treatment, as observed previously (18.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting revealed that TAB1 coprecipitated with TAK1 in both untreated and IL-1-treated cells (Fig. 1,lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that TAB1 constitutively associates with TAK1. However, TAK1 and TAB1 were found to migrate more slowly on SDS-PAGE when cells were treated with IL-1. Treatment with phosphatase eliminated these more slowly migrating bands, suggesting that they are the result of phosphorylation (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4). Next, to test if TAK1 activity correlates with phosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1, we examined whether dephosphorylation reduces TAK1 kinase activity. Anti-TAK1 immunoprecipitates were treated with phosphatase, extensively washed with a buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors, and measured for TAK1 activity in vitro. Phosphatase treatment of the TAK1 complex abolished the ability of TAK1 to phosphorylate MKK6, indicating that dephosphorylation inactivates TAK1 kinase activity (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). The phosphatase-treated immunoprecipitates were subsequently incubated with excessive amounts of unlabeled ATP and re-assayed for kinase activity. This treatment resulted in the prominent reappearance of the slowly migrating forms of TAK1 and TAB1 in both untreated and IL-1-treated cells. Concomitantly, the kinase activity of TAK1 was greatly increased (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and6). Thus, phosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1 correlates with activation of TAK1. These results suggest that IL-1 activates TAK1 via phosphorylation of a preformed TAK1·TAB1 complex. We have previously shown that TAK1 has no kinase activity when ectopically expressed alone, but is activated when TAB1 is coexpressed (18.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 22.Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed how TAB1 activates ectopically expressed TAK1. We transiently expressed HA-TAK1 alone or together with TAB1 in 293 cells. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, immunoblotting, and then in vitrokinase assay (Fig. 2). When expressed alone, HA-TAK1 appeared as a smeared band on SDS-PAGE, and coexpression with TAB1 caused a noticeable shift in its mobility. This apparent modification of TAK1 by TAB1 was accompanied by the induction of TAK1 kinase activity: activity was not detected when TAK1 was ectopically expressed alone, but was detected when TAK1 and TAB1 were coexpressed (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). These results raise the possibility that TAB1-induced activation of ectopically expressed TAK1 is mediated by phosphorylation, as is activation of endogenous TAK1 by IL-1. Treatment of the TAK1 immunoprecipitates with phosphatase both eliminated the slower migrating forms of TAK1 and abolished its kinase activity (Fig. 2, lane 4). When immunocomplexes prepared from cells coexpressing TAK1 and TAB1 were dephosphorylated and then incubated with excessive amounts of unlabeled ATP, TAK1 was rephosphorylated, and its kinase activity was restored (Fig. 2,lane 6). Thus, TAB1-induced activation of TAK1 correlates with phosphorylation of TAK1. When HA-TAK1 was expressed alone in 293 cells, subjected to immunoprecipitation, dephosphorylated, and then incubated with unlabeled ATP, it was found to be neither modified nor activated (Fig.2, lane 5). In contrast, endogenous TAK1 was modified and activated following similar treatment, even in cells not treated with IL-1 (Fig. 1, lane 5). The critical difference between these two cases is that endogenous TAK1 was found to be constitutively associated with TAB1, whereas most of the ectopically expressed HA-TAK1 was found unassociated. Therefore, association of TAK1 with TAB1 may be required for phosphorylation and activation of TAK1. This association is likely to be sufficient for activation of TAK1 in vitrosince TAK1 is activated when TAB1 is coexpressed. On the other hand, endogenous TAK1 remains inactive even though it constitutively forms a complex with TAB1. One possibility is that overexpression of TAK1 and TAB1 somehow mimics the effect of IL-1 stimulation by overcoming the effect of some repressing factor. As shown in Fig. 1, phosphorylation of endogenous TAB1 correlated with TAK1 activity. Similarly, phosphorylation of ectopically expressed TAB1 also correlated with TAK1 activity (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, and 6). When HA-TAK1 alone was ectopically expressed and immunoprecipitated, a small amount of endogenous TAB1 was found to coprecipitate. This associated TAB1 migrated slowly, although HA-TAK1 showed no detectable kinase activity (Fig. 2, lane 1). One explanation for these results is that the small portion of HA-TAK1 that is bound to endogenous TAB1 is in fact catalytically active, but is too minor to be detected by our kinase assay. Consistent with this possibility, a small portion of HA-TAK1 from cells not expressing TAB1 was also observed to migrate slowly (Fig. 2, lane 1). IL-1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 could be mediated by autophosphorylation or by phosphorylation in trans by another protein kinase. These two possibilities could be distinguished by testing whether a catalytically inactive mutant of TAK1 is phosphorylated upon IL-1 treatment. If another kinase is responsible for TAK1 phosphorylation, catalytically inactive TAK1 should still be phosphorylated in response to IL-1. In contrast, if autophosphorylation is responsible, catalytically inactive TAK1 would not be phosphorylated. We employed a catalytically inactive mutant of TAK1 generated by replacing a lysine in the ATP-binding site with tryptophan (HA-TAK1(K63W)). 293IL-1RI cells expressing wild-type HA-TAK1 or HA-TAK1(K63W) were left untreated or were treated with IL-1, and HA epitope-tagged proteins were immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Treatment with IL-1 resulted in a decrease in the mobility of HA-TAK1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and2), similar to what was observed with endogenous TAK1 (Fig.1). In contrast, IL-1 stimulation had no effect on the mobility of HA-TAK1(K63W), indicating that TAK1 kinase activity is required for its phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and4). These results suggest that TAK1 is autophosphorylated upon IL-1 treatment. We next asked whether the TAB1-induced modification of TAK1 observed earlier is also mediated by autophosphorylation. We transiently expressed HA-TAK1(K63W) together with TAB1 in 293 cells. The HA-TAK1 and TAB1 proteins were detected with anti-HA and anti-TAB1 antibodies, respectively. No slowly migrating form of TAK1 was observed when HA-TAK1(K63W) was coexpressed with TAB1 (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1 and 3). Thus, coexpression with TAB1 stimulates TAK1 autophosphorylation activity. In addition, the slowly migrating forms of TAB1 were not observed when TAB1 was coexpressed with the kinase-inactive TAK1 derivative (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 3). This suggests that phosphorylation of TAB1 is also mediated by TAK1. The activation of many protein kinases, including MAPKKKs, involves the phosphorylation of serine and/or threonine residues in a region termed the kinase activation loop between subdomains VII and VIII (28.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). For example, Thr-1393 of MEKK1 and Thr-1460 of budding yeast Ssk2, both located within the activation loop, are essential for their autophosphorylation and activation (7.Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8.Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7586-7594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9.Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 D, Ser-192 of TAK1 corresponds to Thr-1393 of MEKK1 and Thr-1460 of Ssk2. Therefore, we mutated this residue to alanine and tested whether the resulting mutant protein (TAK1(S192A)) was phosphorylated upon IL-1 treatment or by coexpression with TAB1. HA-TAK1(S192A) was expressed in 293IL-1RI cells, and its mobility on SDS-PAGE was examined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. We found that the mobility of this mutant was unaffected by IL-1 treatment (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and6) or coexpression of TAB1 (Fig. 3 B,lane 2). To test if Ser-192 is essential for TAK1 kinase activity, we examined its ability to phosphorylate MKK6. In contrast to wild-type TAK1, no kinase activity was detected when the S192A mutant was coexpressed with TAB1 (Fig.4 A). These results show that Ser-192 is important for both IL-1- and TAB1-induced autophosphorylation and activation of TAK1 and thus is probably the site for autophosphorylation. To directly confirm the phosphorylation at position 192 in activated TAK1, we used high resolution Tris/Tricine gel electrophoresis to fractionate proteolyzed 32P-labeled TAK1 (Fig.3 C). HA-TAK1 or HA-TAK1(S192A) was coexpressed with TAB1 in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and digested with CNBr. Coexpression of TAB1 increased phosphorylation of multiple phosphopeptides of wild-type TAK1 containing a phosphopeptide of ∼1.0 kDa (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and2). Only two CNBr-cleaved fragments of TAK1 are predicted to migrate around 1.0 kDa; one is peptide 187–196, which contains Thr-187 and Ser-192, and the another is peptide 494–502, which does not contain any serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues. Mutation of Ser-192 abolished phosphorylation of the 1.0-kDa peptide (Fig.3 C, lane 3). Thus, we conclude that Ser-192 is a phosphorylation site of activated TAK1. It has been shown for some kinases that replacing particular residues in the activation loop with negatively charged amino acids results in the generation of a constitutively active mutant (28.Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). We thus generated mutants of TAK1 in which Ser-192 was replaced with aspartic acid or glutamic acid (TAK1(S192D) or TAK1(S192E), respectively) and compared their kinase activities with that of wild-type TAK1. We found that neither mutant exhibited TAK1 kinase activity, even when coexpressed together with TAB1 (Fig. 4 A; data not shown). These results suggest that the molecular environment achieved by phosphorylation of Ser-192 in TAK1 cannot be mimicked by replacement with negatively charged residues. We have previously demonstrated that TAK1 activates NF-κB via the NF-κB-inducing kinase/IκB kinase cascade (21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). To verify that phosphorylation of Ser-192 is critical for NF-κB activation, we examined the effect of TAK1 mutants on activation using an NF-κB-dependent reporter system (Fig. 4 B). We transiently expressed an NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid (Ig-κ/luciferase) together with wild-type or various mutants of TAK1. As observed previously (21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar), wild-type TAK1 strongly stimulated NF-κB-dependent reporter expression when coexpressed with TAB1. In contrast, none of the S192A, S192D, and S192E mutants defective in kinase activity activated NF-κB-dependent transcription, even when coexpressed with TAB1. Thus, Ser-192 is also important for TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB. Autophosphorylation can occur by either an intra- or intermolecular reaction. To distinguish between these, we constructed an HA epitope-tagged deletion mutant of TAK1 (HA-TAK1ΔC) that lacks 176 amino acids of the TAK1 C terminus, but contains the entire kinase domain. HA-TAK1ΔC can be separated from wild-type HA-TAK1 by SDS-PAGE. We transiently expressed HA-TAK1, HA-TAK1(K63W), HA-TAK1ΔC, or the catalytically inactive mutant of HA-TAK1ΔC (HA-TAK1ΔC(K63W)) together with HA-TAB1 as an activator of TAK1. In addition, HA-TAB1 was added to monitor transphosphorylation by TAK1. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody followed byin vitro kinase assay. HA-TAK1, when coexpressed with HA-TAB1, became autophosphorylated and phosphorylated HA-TAB1 intrans (Fig. 5, lane 1). HA-TAK1ΔC was catalytically active, phosphorylating both HA-TAB1 and itself (Fig. 5, lane 2). When HA-TAK1 was coexpressed with the catalytically inactive mutant HA-TAK1ΔC(K63W) and HA-TAB1, HA-TAK1 and HA-TAB1 became phosphorylated, but HA-TAK1ΔC(K63W) did not (Fig. 5, lane 3). Conversely, when HA-TAK1ΔC was coexpressed with the catalytically inactive mutant HA-TAK1(K63W) and TAB1, HA-TAK1ΔC and TAB1 became phosphorylated, but HA-TAK1(K63W) did not (Fig. 5,lane 4). Thus, autophosphorylation of TAK1 is an intramolecular reaction. The mechanisms by which MAPKKKs are activated are now being elucidated. In many cases, activation involves phosphorylation of MAPKKKs. In some signaling pathways, phosphorylation of MAPKKKs is mediated by other protein kinases such as Ste20-like MAPKKKKs. In other cases, autophosphorylation is implicated in the activation of MAPKKKs. In this study, we demonstrated that autophosphorylation of TAK1 is important for IL-1- and TAB1-induced activation of TAK1. Mutation to alanine of Ser-192, which lies in the activation loop between subdomains VII and VIII, abolishes both IL-1- and TAB1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1. Furthermore, this mutation generates a kinase-inactive form of TAK1 that is impaired in its ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrates or to activate NF-κB. Based on these results, we conclude that Ser-192 is the site of TAK1 autophosphorylation and is critical for its catalytic activity. In addition, we also replaced Ser-192 with aspartic acid or glutamic acid in an attempt to mimic the negative charges resulting from phosphorylation. However, these mutations caused the loss of kinase activity. Similar observations have been reported for analogous mutants in MEK5, MKK4, and MEKK1 (8.Siow Y.L. Kalmar G.B. Sanghera J.S. Tai G. Oh S.S. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7586-7594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This further suggests that the molecular environment of phosphorylated Ser-192 in TAK1 is important for its catalytic activity. HGK, a Ste20-like MAPKKKK, has been implicated in the activation of TAK1 leading to JNK activation (16.Yao Z. Zhou G. Wang X.S. Brown A. Diener K. Gan H. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2118-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HGK is a serine/threonine kinase, and HGK-induced JNK activation is blocked by a kinase-negative mutant of TAK1, but not by a kinase-negative mutant of MEKK1. Since HGK is activated by TNF and UV irradiation, HGK may function as an upstream kinase for TAK1 in these signaling pathways. Given that TAK1 is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including transforming growth factor-β, TNF, IL-1, and environmental stresses (18.Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8141-8144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), it should not be surprising that TAK1 is regulated by multiple mechanisms. TNF may activate TAK1 via HGK-mediated phosphorylation, whereas IL-1 activates TAK1 via autophosphorylation. Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether HGK activates TAK1 by phosphorylation of Ser-192, similar to how TAK1 is autophosphorylated in response to IL-1. Autophosphorylation of a kinase may be mediated by either an inter- or intramolecular reaction. One common example of intermolecular autophosphorylation is the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (30.Stock J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 825-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, these receptors form homodimers and phosphorylate their dimerized partner, resulting in activation of the kinase. Similar mechanisms of activation have been described for such MAPKKKs as ASK1 and MLK3 (10.Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11.Gotoh Y. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17477-17482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In response to upstream stimuli, both MLK3 and ASK1 form homodimers and are consequently activated. Furthermore, they are highly active when overexpressed without upstream stimuli, presumably due to spontaneous dimerization resulting from overexpression. This is not the case for TAK1, which has virtually no kinase activity when overexpressed alone. Furthermore, we have shown here that autophosphorylation of TAK1 occurs by an intramolecular reaction. In addition, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays using two different epitope-tagged versions of TAK1 (HA-TAK1 and FLAG-TAK1). HA-TAK1 was not coprecipitated with FLAG-TAK1 in IL-1-treated cells or in cells cotransfected with TAB1. 2K. Kishimoto, unpublished observation. Therefore, it appears that the activation of TAK1 does not involve dimerization. Similarly, autophosphorylation by an intramolecular reaction has been reported for MEKK1 and Ssk2 (7.Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9.Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The potential autophosphorylation sites of TAK1, MEKK1, and Ssk2 are present at homologous positions within their activation loops. In the case of TAK1, we have demonstrated that another protein, TAB1, is required for autophosphorylation and activation. Interestingly, autophosphorylation of Ssk2 also requires the interacting protein Ssk1, which functions as an upstream regulator of Ssk2 (9.Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, TAK1, Ssk2, and possibly MEKK1 may be regulated by a common activation mechanism. Collectively, these observations suggest that there are at least two different mechanisms for MAPKKK activation that involve autophosphorylation, namely dimerization-induced intermolecular autophosphorylation and regulator-dependent intramolecular autophosphorylation. IL-1 plays a central role in proinflammatory responses. Cellular responses to IL-1 are mediated by cascades of intracellular signaling events, including activation of NF-κB as well as activation of JNK (31.Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding of IL-1 to its receptor, the IL-1 signal is transduced from the IL-1 receptor complex to an adapter protein, TNF-associated factor 6 (32.Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Following exposure of the cells to IL-1, TAK1 is recruited to the TNF-associated factor 6 complex, where it becomes activated (21.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Activated TAK1 then stimulates a MAPK cascade leading to JNK activation and an NF-κB-inducing kinase/IκB kinase cascade leading to NF-κB activation. We have demonstrated here that TAK1 is activated via autophosphorylation in response to IL-1. How, then, does IL-1 induce TAK1 autophosphorylation? Although endogenous TAK1 constitutively associates with TAB1, it remains unphosphorylated and inactive in the absence of IL-1 stimulation. Therefore, binding of TAB1 to TAK1 is not sufficient to induce phosphorylation and activation of endogenous TAK1 in vivo. On the other hand, ectopically expressed TAK1 is activated by coexpression with TAB1 even in the absence of IL-1. Furthermore, when endogenous TAK1·TAB1 complexes prepared from unstimulated cells are incubated in vitro with ATP, TAK1 is phosphorylated and activated. Thus, binding of TAB1 to TAK1 seems to be sufficient for activation in vitro. These results raise the possibility that a putative inhibitory factor blocks the activity of the endogenous TAK1·TAB1 complex in the absence of IL-1 stimulation. IL-1 treatment may disrupt this inhibitory regulation and thereby allow autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of TAK1 to proceed. Further study to identify this inhibitory regulation of TAK1 will be needed. We thank E. Nishida for helpful discussions and M. Lamphier and R. Ruggieri for critical reading of the manuscript."

Although mechanisms associated with Aβ generation are not fully understood, it is known that Aβ can be generated within endosomal compartments upon internalization of APP from the cell surface. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) was previously shown to mediate the endocytosis of APP isoforms containing the Kunitz proteinase inhibitor domain (Kounnas, M. Z., Moir, R. D., Rebeck, G. W., Bush, A. I., Argraves, W. S., Tanzi, R. E., Hyman, B. T., and Strickland, D. K. (1995)Cell 82, 331–340; Knauer, M. F., Orlando, R. A., and Glabe, C. G. (1996) Brain Res. 740, 6–14). The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that LRP-mediated internalization of cell surface APP can modulate APP processing and thereby affect Aβ generation. Here, we show that long term culturing of cells in the presence of the LRP-antagonist RAP leads to increased cell surface levels of APP and a significant reduction in Aβ synthesis. Further, restoring LRP function in LRP-deficient cells results in a substantial increase in Aβ production. These findings demonstrate that LRP contributes to Aβ generation and suggest novel pharmacological approaches to reduce Aβ levels based on selective LRP blockade. β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ), which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, is derived from the transmembrane β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing. Although mechanisms associated with Aβ generation are not fully understood, it is known that Aβ can be generated within endosomal compartments upon internalization of APP from the cell surface.

EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2757-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), which are the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (3.Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Aβ is derived from proteolytic processing of a ubiquitous transmembrane protein termed β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) (4.Tanzi R.E. Gusella J.F. Watkins P.C. Bruns G.A.P. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Van Keuren M.L. Paterson D. Pagan S. Kurnit D.M. Neve R.L. Science. 1987; 235: 880-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Although the factors governing production and deposition of Aβ are not fully understood, it has been shown that APP can undergo at least two post-translational processing pathways (3.Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). In a nonamyloidogenic pathway APP is cleaved within the Aβ region by a proteinase activity known as α-secretase. This prevents generation of Aβ and gives rise to a soluble form of APP (sAPPα), which is found in the extracellular milieu and constitutes a marker for nonamyloidogenic processing. Alternatively, APP can undergo proteolytic cleavage by β- and γ-secretases to generate Aβ. This is referred to as the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, which can take place while internalized cell surface APP trafficks through the endocytic pathway (5.Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, binds and mediates the endocytosis of soluble (6.Kounnas M.Z.

Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) isoforms containing a Kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain. LRP is a large, multifunctional endocytic receptor abundantly expressed in liver and brain that mediates the hepatic uptake of circulating chylomicron remnants (8.Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), serpin-enzyme complexes (9.Kounnas M.Z. Church F.C. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J.

LRP is also expressed in fibroblasts, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, neurons, and activated but not resting glial cells (14.Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor is involved in the binding and removal of interstitial ligands (e.g. proteinases and lipoproteins) produced by these cells. Targeted deletion of the LRP gene in mice leads to death of the embryo at day 13.5 (15.Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), demonstrating that LRP plays a critical role during development. A 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) (16.Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Battey F. Behre E. McTigue K. Battey J.F. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (18.Battey F. Gåfvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits ligand binding (19.Herz J. Goldstein J.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP is found primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is thought to function as a molecular chaperone by assisting in receptor folding and processing and by preventing the association of newly synthesized receptors with endogenous ligands (21.Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 22.Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because of its high affinity for LRP and its ability to antagonize ligand binding, RAP constitutes a powerful tool to study LRP-mediated mechanisms. The objective of the present investigation was to test the hypothesis that LRP plays a role in the pathobiology of AD by facilitating delivery of cell surface APP to endosomal compartments, where the Aβ peptide can be generated. To this end, we employed two main experimental strategies. The first one involved culturing cells in the presence of recombinant RAP as a means of preventing cell surface LRP-APP interactions. The results of these experiments demonstrated that long term incubation with RAP results in increased levels of both cell surface APP and sAPPα, along with a significant decrease in Aβ production. As a second strategy the LRP gene was restored in LRP-deficient cells, and the consequences on APP processing were analyzed. These experiments revealed that LRP expression favors the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, leading to decreased sAPPα levels along with a significant increase in Aβ production. Human RAP was expressed in bacteria as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase as described previously (20.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage with thrombin and purification of recombinant RAP was carried out as described (20.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 5A6, which reacts with the LRP β subunit (85 kDa), and monoclonal antibody 8G1, which reacts with the LRP α subunit (515 kDa), have been described previously (23.Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal IgG R777, which reacts with the LRP α subunit, was prepared as described (17.Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody 6E10 (and biotinylated 6E10) raised against residues 1–17 of Aβ (specific for α-secretase cleavage prosite), and monoclonal antibody 4G8, specific for residues 17 to 24 of Aβ were purchased from Senetek PLC (St. Louis, MO). A rabbit polyclonal anti-Aβ that recognizes the C terminus of the peptide, was obtained from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillow, CA). Monoclonal antibody 22C11, raised against an epitope within the N terminus of APP, was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. H4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. For stably transfected H4/APP cells, the medium was supplemented with G418 (200 μg/ml). 13-5-1 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum optimized for Chinese hamster ovary cells, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. In the case of 13-5-1/APP cells, 200 μg/ml zeocine was added to the medium. For the experiments involving RAP treatment, subconfluent cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of 500 nm recombinant RAP (RAP-treated) for 5 days in serum-containing medium and then for 24 h in serum-free medium supplemented with Nutridoma®-NS medium supplement (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Before changing to serum-free medium the cells were thoroughly washed with 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline to rid them of serum proteins. This 24 h conditioned medium was then used to detect both sAPPα and secreted Aβ. During the 5-day period, cell were kept at ≤80% confluency. 13-5-1 cells were stably co-transfected with the cDNA for human APP751 (cloned into pHD plasmid) (24.Muller G. Ruppert S. Schmid E. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and pSec-Tag plasmid, which contained the zeocine resistance gene. 48 h later the selection process was initiated by adding 600 μg/ml zeocine to the growth medium. 13-5-1/APP cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA for full-length human LRP (cloned into a pcDNA3.1 plasmid vector) or with vector alone (mock transfectants), using FuGeneTM6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and following manufacturer's instructions. Cellular uptake of125I-labeled α2-macroglobulin activated with methylamine (125I-α2M*) by 13-5-1/APP cells transiently transfected with LRP or vector alone was measured as described previously (25.Fitzgerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated onto 12-well plates at ∼1 × 105 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were then washed twice with assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Nutridoma medium supplement; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin) and incubated in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with assay medium containing 9 nm125I-α2M* for 5 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the cells were washed three times with assay medium and then detached with 0.5 ml of trypsin/proteinase K (to dissociate LRP-125I-α2M* complexes from the cell surface) and then pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 5 min). The amount of internalized 125I-α2M* was determined upon measuring the radioactivity associated with the cell pellet in a γ-counter. Nonspecific uptake was assessed by measuring125I-α2M* internalization in the presence of excess amounts (1 μm) of the LRP antagonist RAP. For detection of intracellular proteins, whole cell extracts were prepared using an SDS-free lysis buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20) supplemented with proteinase inhibitors. To detect sAPPα and secreted Aβ, 24 h conditioned media were concentrated 5–10× either by using Centricon spin columns (3 kDa molecular mass cut-off) or by lyophilization and resuspension in water. Extracts and conditioned media were subjected to SDS-PAGE using pre-cast Tris-glycine gels from NOVEX (San Diego, CA). In all cases, gel loading was normalized to total protein content in the cell extract (or the corresponding cell extract when medium samples were used). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were then blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) dry skim milk for at least 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibody followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for at least 1 h at room temperature. Both antibodies were diluted in 3% milk/Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20. Immunoblotted proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Aβ present in conditioned medium was detected by sandwich ELISA, using antibody 4G8 (Senetek PLC) to capture Aβ and biotinylated antibody 6E10 (Senetek PLC) to detect it. Alternatively, antibody 6E10 was used to capture Aβ and rabbit polyclonal anti-Aβ (BIOSOURCE International) used for detection. Both assays gave similar results. 100-μl aliquots of concentrated conditioned medium were incubated in 96-well plates previously coated with 100 μl of capturing antibody (4 μg/ml) and blocked with bovine serum albumin-containing buffer, for 2 days at 4 °C. At the completion of this time, the wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of the appropriate detecting antibody i.e. biotinylated 6E10 or polyclonal anti-Aβ, used at a final concentration of 1 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. Finally, depending on whether biotinylated 6E10 or polyclonal anti-Aβ was used as the detecting antibody, the wells were incubated for 2–4 h at room temperature with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate or with goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, respectively. Aβ levels were quantified using a standard curve prepared with synthetic Aβ1–40 (fromBIOSOURCE International); control experiments showed that RAP did not interfere with Aβ detection. The data were normalized to mg of protein in the corresponding cell extract and statistically analyzed using the unpaired version of the Student'st test. Monoclonal antibody 7H5 raised against the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain of APP751/770 (26.Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Marzloff K. Barbour R. Schenk D. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 51: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was 125I-labeled using Iodogen reagent and used to detect surface APP751 in H4-APP cells that had been grown in the absence or presence of RAP (see RAP treatment methods above). The surface binding assay was performed as described previously (20.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with assay medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Nutridoma medium supplement, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1.5% bovine serum albumin) and then incubated in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then chilled by placing them on ice for 1 h (to minimize endocytosis) and incubated with assay medium containing 10 nm125I-labeled 7H5 for 2 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was assessed by incubating cells with 10 nm125I-labeled 7H5 and excess (250 nm) unlabeled 7H5. In addition, the assay medium contained 250 nm mouse IgG to minimize binding to nonspecific IgG-binding sites. The cells were then washed three times with cold 1× Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and removed from the wells by treating with trypsin-versene. The radioactivity associated with the cells was measured in a γ-counter. To test the hypothesis that LRP-mediated internalization of cell surface APP alters the processing of APP, we sought to prevent the association of APP and LRP on the cell surface and study the consequences on APP metabolism and Aβ generation. To this end, we used RAP, a potent LRP antagonist that disrupts interaction of this receptor with all known ligands (20.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including APP. H4 human neuroglioma cells stably transfected with human APP751 (H4-APP cells) were chosen for these experiments as they express significant amounts of LRP (Fig.1 A, right panel) and had previously been used to study APP processing (27.Kuentzel S.L. Ali S.M. Altman R.A. Greenberg B.D. Raub T.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Expression of APP and production of Aβ by H4-APP cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 A, left panel) and sandwich ELISA, respectively (Fig. 1 B). H4-APP cells were cultured for 5 days in the absence (control) or presence of recombinant RAP (RAP-treated). Immunoblotting of cell extracts showed that RAP treatment did not alter the total amount of APP present in cells (Fig.2 A). Additionally, RAP treatment had no noticeable effect on the total levels of LRP as assessed by immunoblotting (data not shown). However, surface binding of an 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular domain of APP (monoclonal antibody 7H5) revealed that RAP treatment caused a significant increase (∼3–4-fold) in cell surface APP levels (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, immunoblotting analysis showed that the conditioned medium from RAP-treated cells contained substantially more sAPPα than that from control cells (Fig.3 A). We next analyzed the effect of RAP treatment on the amount of Aβ secreted by H4-APP cells. Fig. 3 B shows that RAP-treated cells produced and secreted substantially less (∼4–5-fold) Aβ than control cells. Control experiments confirmed that RAP does not interfere with detection of Aβ by ELISA. The effect of RAP treatment on APP metabolism (i.e. surface levels and Aβ generation) was not immediate and required at least 3 days in culture to observe the maximal change. Although it is not clear why prolonged treatment with RAP is required, other studies have found that prolonged treatment of cells with RAP is also necessary to increase cell surface levels of the urokinase receptor (28.Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a receptor system that can also be internalized by LRP. In summary, these data show that blocking LRP function by prolonged treatment of cells with the LRP antagonist RAP favors the nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, resulting in increased levels of both cell surface APP and sAPPα, along with a significant decrease in Aβ production.Figure 2RAP treatment causes accumulation of APP on the cell surface.

In addition, the extent of 7H5 nonspecific binding was assessed by measuring surface binding of125I-labeled 7H5 in the presence of excess unlabeled 7H5.

Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the very low density lipoprotein receptor (18.Battey F. Gåfvels M.E.

To confirm the specificity of an LRP-mediated effect on APP processing, we sought to express the human LRP gene in LRP-deficient cells and analyze the consequences on APP/Aβ metabolism. We predicted that if LRP facilitates the amyloidogenic processing of APP as our experiments with RAP suggested, restoring LRP function in LRP-deficient cells should result in decreased levels of sAPPα and increased generation/secretion of Aβ. To date, only a mouse fibroblast (29.Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, termed 13-5-1 (25.Fitzgerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), have been developed that are genetically deficient in LRP. For these studies we used the Chinese hamster ovary cell line, because these cells are relatively easy to transfect and have been extensively used to study APP processing (30.Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. Selkoe D.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 991-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Citron M. Diehl T.S. Gordon G. Biere A.L. Seubert P. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13170-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). 13-5-1 cells were stably transfected with human APP751 (13-5-1/APP cells); expression of APP was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig.4 A), and Aβ production in control and transfected cells was quantified by sandwich ELISA (Fig.4 B). 13-5-1/APP cells were then transiently transfected with the human LRP gene. LRP is synthesized as a single chain molecule of 600 kDa that is then processed in the trans-Golgi into its α (515 kDa) and β (85 kDa) subunits (32.Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with antibodies specific for the α and β subunits showed that LRP was expressed and appropriately processed in the transiently transfected 13-5-1/APP cells (Fig. 5 A). Normal function of the transfected receptor was confirmed by measuring cellular uptake of 125I-α2M*, a major LRP ligand (23.Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, only the LRP-transfected and not the mock transfected cells were able to internalize125I-α2M* (Fig. 5 B), and this uptake was inhibited in the presence of excess RAP.Figure 5Expression of human LRP in LRP-deficient 13-5-1/APP cells. A, LRP-deficient 13-5-1/APP cells were transiently transfected with vector alone (lanes 1) or the cDNA for human LRP (lanes 2). Whole cell extracts were subjected to nonreducing 4–12% SDS-PAGE (20 μg of protein/lane) and analyzed by immunoblotting for the LRP α subunit (left panel) using R777 and the β subunit (right panel) using monoclonal IgG 5A6. B, cellular uptake of125I-α2M* by mock transfected and LRP-transfected 13-5-1/APP cells was assessed by incubating cells at 37 °C for 5 h in the presence of 125I-labeld α2M* and then measuring the extent of internalized125I-labeld α2M* as described under “Materials and Methods.” Nonspecific uptake was assessed by measuring internalization of α2M* in the presence of excess amounts of the LRP antagonist RAP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Once expression and function of transfected LRP was confirmed, we studied the impact of restoring LRP function on APP processing. The experiments revealed that although LRP expression did not significantly alter total cellular APP levels (Fig.6 A), the conditioned medium from LRP-transfected cells contained substantially less sAPPα than that from mock transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). This finding supported the prediction that LRP function favors the amyloidogenic processing of APP suggested by our RAP treatment experiments. We then investigated whether restoring LRP function had also affected the amount of Aβ produced and secreted by cells. When conditioned medium from mock transfected and LRP-transfected 13-5-1/APP cells was assayed by sandwich ELISA to detect Aβ, it was found that the medium from LRP-transfected cells contained approximately three to four times more Aβ than that of mock transfected cells (Fig. 6 C). In summary, these results indicate that the presence of functional LRP favors the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing, resulting in decreased levels of sAPPα and a dramatic increase in Aβ production. The objective of the current investigation was to determine whether the multifunctional endocytic receptor LRP can modulate APP metabolism and in particular, the production of Aβ peptide. Two different experimental approaches were employed to test this hypothesis. In the first series of experiments we utilized RAP, a potent LRP antagonist, to prevent the association of APP and LRP on the cell surface. Long term culture of cells in the presence of RAP resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of Aβ peptide secreted into the medium. This decrease was associated with an increase in the steady-state level of cell surface APP and an increase in the amount of sAPPα present in the media. Although the need for prolonged treatment with RAP to observe maximal changes in APP metabolism is not understood at this point, it is possible that only a small fraction of the APP present on the cell surface interacts with LRP because APP-proteinase complexes are the preferred ligand for LRP (7.Knauer M.F. Orlando R.A. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Formation of such complexes are likely to be limited by the availability of the proteinases. In fact, studies on the urokinase receptor, another receptor system that interacts with LRP, show that surface levels of this receptor increase significantly only after cells are cultured for at least 3 days in the presence of RAP (28.Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although we have interpreted the effect of RAP treatment as blocking APP/LRP interactions on the cell surface, it cannot be ruled out that exogenously added RAP might also affect interaction of these molecules within intracellular compartments. However, the facts that both of these cell lines express endogenous RAP, which is localized intracellularly, and that RAP treatment caused an increase in cell surface levels of APP are more consistent with the hypothesis that RAP is acting on the cell surface. To further confirm the role of LRP in APP processing, a second series of experiments were performed in which the human LRP gene was introduced into LRP-deficient cells stably expressing human APP. The results indicated that restoring expression and function of LRP in these cells resulted in decreased levels of sAPPα in the medium and a substantial increase in the amount of Aβ produced and secreted by the cells. Together, the results of these experiments show that the lack of LRP activity correlates with a decline in Aβ production, whereas the presence of functional LRP is associated with increased generation and secretion of Aβ. We propose that the interaction of APP with LRP on the cell surface modulates APP trafficking within the endocytic pathway such that its amyloidogenic processing is favored. This could occur if association of APP with LRP increased the resident time of APP within endosomes, where Aβ can be generated (5.Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, binding of APP to LRP could result in conformational changes such that the β- and/or γ-secretase cleavage sites on APP become more accessible. APP exists as multiple isoforms resulting from alternate splicing of its mRNA. The longer isoforms (APP770 and APP751) contain a KPI domain capable of inhibiting proteinases such as factors XIa and IXa (33.Schmaier A.H. Dahl L.D. Rozemuller A.J. Roos R.A. Wagner S.L. Chung R. Van Nostrand W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2540-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and are expressed in neurons as well as other cell types. Studies suggest that the majority of APP in the central nervous system contains the KPI domain (34.Van Nostrand W.E. Farrow J.S. Wagner S.L. Bhasin R. Goldgaber D. Cotman C.W. Cunningham D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10302-10306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, KPI-containing APP isoforms seem to be more amyloidogenic (35.Ho L. Fukuchi K. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30929-30934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and their relative abundance in the brain increases with AD (36.Moir R.D. Lynch T. Bush A.I. Whyte S. Henry A. Portbury S. Multhaup G. Small D.H. Tanzi R.E. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5013-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The fact that the presence of a KPI domain on the extracellular region of APP is required for binding to LRP (6.Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) may represent another clue to why the interaction of LRP with APP on the surface of neurons may contribute to the pathological processes leading to AD. Further, adaptor proteins such as FE65, whose protein interaction domains bind the cytoplasmic portions of both LRP and APP (37.Trommsdorff R. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33556-33560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), may also be involved in linking these two molecules. The dramatic loss of Aβ synthesis observed when LRP function is ablated either pharmacologically or genetically is consistent with a large body of data implicating LRP in the pathogenesis of AD. First, genetic studies reveal that a silent polymorphism in the LRP gene is associated with increased risk for AD (38.Kang D.E. Saitoh T. Chen X. Xia Y. Masliah E. Hansen L.A. Thomas R.G. Thal L.J.

Moreover, LRP expression is up-regulated in both reactive astrocytes and activated microglia (42.Lopes M.B. Bogaev C.A. Gonias S.L. VandenBerg S.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), two components of mature amyloid plaques, and LRP itself is found in senile plaques along with many of its ligands (14.Rebeck G.W. Reiter J.S. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar,43.Rebeck G.W. Harr S.D. Strickland D.K. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition to binding APP, LRP is the primary receptor in the brain for apoE and activated α2M, two proteins shown to form complexes with Aβ (44.LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Narita M. Holtzman D.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1904-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, LRP is a converging point for the metabolism of three proteins (APP, apoE, and α2M) genetically and biochemically associated with AD. The direct link we now demonstrate between LRP activity and Aβ production provides strong biochemical evidence for the involvement of LRP in the pathobiology of AD and suggests new approaches for reducing Aβ levels by preventing the association of full-length APP with LRP.

In common with other mRNAs whose protein products have a major regulatory function, the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of Apaf-1 is long, G-C rich and has the potential to form secondary structure. We have shown that the 5' UTR of Apaf-1 contains an internal ribosome entry segment, located in a 233 nucleotide region towards the 3' end of the leader, and that the translation initiation of this mRNA occurs only by internal ribosome entry. The Apaf-1 IRES is active in almost all human cell types tested, including Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), Human liver carcinoma (HepG2), Human breast carcinoma (MCF7), Human embryonic kidney (HK293), African Green Monkey kidney (COS7) and Human lung (MRC5). The Apaf-1 IRES initiates translation as efficiently as the HRV IRES, but is less active than the c-myc IRES. We propose that the Apaf-1 IRES ensures that a constant cellular level of Apaf-1 protein is maintained even under conditions where cap-dependent translation is compromised.

https://openalex.org/W2061252595,"The congenital fibrosarcoma t(12;15)(p13;q25) rearrangement splices the ETV6 (TEL) gene on chromosome 12p13 in frame with the NTRK3 (TRKC) neurotrophin-3 receptor gene on chromosome 15q25. Resultant ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcripts encode the helix - loop - helix (HLH) dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain of NTRK3. We show here that ETV6-NTRK3 homodimerizes and is capable of forming heterodimers with wild-type ETV6. Moreover, ETV6-NTRK3 has PTK activity and is autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues. To determine if the fusion protein has transforming activity, NIH3T3 cells were infected with recombinant retroviral vectors carrying the full-length ETV6-NTRK3 cDNA. These cells exhibited a transformed phenotype, grew macroscopic colonies in soft agar, and formed tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We hypothesize that chimeric proteins mediate transformation by dysregulating NTRK3 signal transduction pathways via ligand-independent dimerization and PTK activation. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a series of ETV6-NTRK3 mutants in NIH3T3 cells and assessed their transformation activities. Deletion of the ETV6 HLH domain abolished dimer formation with either ETV6 or ETV6-NTRK3, and cells expressing this mutant protein were morphologically non-transformed and failed to grow in soft agar. An ATP-binding mutant failed to autophosphorylate and completely lacked transformation activity. Mutants of the three NTRK3 PTK activation-loop tyrosines had variable PTK activity but had limited to absent transformation activity. Of a series of signaling molecules well known to bind to wild-type NTRK3, only phospholipase-Cgamma (PLCgamma) associated with ETV6-NTRK3. However, a PTK active mutant unable to bind PLCgamma did not show defects in transformation activity. Our studies confirm that ETV6-NTRK3 is a transforming protein that requires both an intact dimerization domain and a functional PTK domain for transformation activity. Oncogene (2000) 19, 906 - 915."

Biochem. 1986; 19: 353-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have shown that cytosolic proteins from parathyroids bind to the 3′-UTR of the rat PTH mRNA and regulate mRNA stability (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). PT proteins from hypocalcemic rats show increased binding to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR by mobility shift and UV cross-linking assays, and this protein-RNA binding is decreased with hypophosphatemic PT proteins. Thus, the level of protein-RNA binding directly correlates with PTH mRNA levels. Since there is no PT cell line, an in vitro PTH RNA stability assay was utilized. This assay showed stabilization of the transcript by hypocalcemic proteins and marked instability with hypophosphatemic proteins (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that there are instability regions in the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR that are protected by RNA-binding proteins. This protein-RNA interaction determines PTH mRNA stability. In the present study, we have isolated one of the proteins that bind to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR by affinity chromatography and characterized its functional role in stabilizing the PTH mRNA. Addition of recombinant AUF1 stabilized the PTH transcript in an in vitro degradation assay with PT proteins. These results suggest an important function for AUF1 in the transduction of changes in serum calcium and phosphate to the stability of the PTH mRNA. Weanling male Sabra rats were fed a normal calcium (0.6%), normal phosphate (0.3%) diet; a low calcium (0.02%), normal phosphate (0.3%) diet; or a low phosphate (0.02%), normal calcium (0.6%) diet (Teklad) for 3 weeks. At 3 weeks, the microdissected parathyroid and other tissues were removed under pentobarbital anesthesia and blood samples were taken for serum calcium and phosphate. The low calcium diet resulted in a serum calcium of 4.6 ± 0.5 mg/dl (control = 10.7 ± 0.5 mg/dl). The low phosphate diet resulted in a serum phosphate of 4.2 ± 0.3 mg/dl (control = 9.7 ± 0.9 mg/dl) and serum calcium of 12.5 ± 0.6 mg/dl (control = 10.7 ± 0.5 mg/dl). S100 extracts were prepared from rat brain tissue. The tissue was removed from the rat under pentobarbital anesthesia and immediately washed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer at 4 °C. The tissue was homogenized with a Polytron in one volume of S100 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h (Beckman type TL-100) at 4 °C. The high speed supernatant (S100) was stored at −80 °C until it was used for protein purification and binding assays. Heparin-Sepharose (6 g) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to prepare a 25-ml bed volume column. The heparin-Sepharose column was washed with 250 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1 m NaCl. S100 brain tissue extract from 20 rats (300 mg) was applied to the column (twice). The column was washed with 550 ml of buffer B containing NaCl (0.1m), and the bound proteins were eluted from the column by a step gradient of buffer B containing increasing NaCl concentrations (0.1–1 m). The fractions were assayed for binding to the PTH 3′-UTR by UV cross-linking. Fractions that showed maximal binding to the PTH 3′-UTR eluted at 230–550 mm NaCl and were pooled. The pooled fractions were then loaded on a CNBr-activated Sepharose column bound to 200 μg of PTH mRNA 3′-UTR that had been synthesized in vitro. The column was washed with buffer B containing 0.1m NaCl and the fractions were eluted with increasing NaCl concentrations (0.1–1 m) and assayed by a UV cross-linking assay. Fractions that showed maximal binding were pooled and concentrated using a Centricon 30 filter (Amicon, Beverly, MA). A sample was used to identify the RNA-binding proteins by Northwestern analysis with PTH 3′-UTR as a labeled probe. The pooled fractions were run on a preparative polyacrylamide gradient gel (7–12%) and stained with Coomassie Blue. A 50-kDa band was excised from the gel, degraded with the endoprotease LysC, and the peptide products were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Five peptides were microsequenced by Edman degradation. UV cross-linking assay was performed using 10 μg of either brain S100 extracts or microdissected PT extracts as described previously. To measure binding activity of eluates from the RNA column, salt concentrations were normalized (as measured by conductivity). Equivalent aliquots of each fraction were tested. In some experiments, recombinant AUF1 protein was used. The proteins were incubated with 32P-labeled RNA for the full-length or the 3′-UTR of the PTH cDNA. After UV cross-linking, the samples were digested by RNase A, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiographed as described previously (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Protein extracts were electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels (13.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). For Northwestern assays, the membranes were pre-soaked in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween) and then incubated in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mg/ml BSA for 15 min at room temperature. The membranes were washed twice in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT), and then incubation was performed in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 8% glycerol) supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase-free tRNA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the RNA probe (1 × 106cpm/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C and then for 2 h at room temp. The membranes were washed twice at room temperature for 5 min with TNE buffer, and RNA binding to the proteins was visualized by autoradiography. The PTH 3′-UTR RNA probe (5000 cpm) was incubated with microdissected PT or brain extracts (10 μg) or rAUF1 as indicated in a final volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mmDTT, 8 units of RNasin, 2 μg of tRNA, 50 μg of heparin, and 1 μg of BSA for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were run on a native polyacrylamide gel (4% polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide; 70:1) in a cold room. RNA-protein binding was visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. Labeled and unlabeled RNA was transcribed from linearized plasmids using an RNA production kit (Promega, WI) and the appropriate RNA polymerases. A linearized plasmid construct containing the full-length PTH cDNA in Bluescript KS (Invitrogen) was used as described previously (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). For the 3′-UTR of the PTH cDNA, a PCR product (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) was subcloned into PCRII (Invitrogen, CA) and used for transcribing labeled and unlabeled RNA. The RNA was used for the affinity column, Northwestern analysis, UV cross-linking, REMSA, and in vitro degradation assays. The 63-nt transcript containing the protein binding sequences in the 3′-UTR (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) was transcribed from a PCR product of the cDNA subcloned into PCRII (Invitrogen). The sequence of the 63-nt transcript is: 5′-GTCTCTTCCAATGATTCCATTTCAATATATTCTTCTTTTTAAAGTATTACACATTTCCA -CTTC-3′. Preparation of S100 parathyroid protein extracts for the RNA degradation assay and the assay itself were performed as before (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Transcripts (0.2 × 106 cpm) were incubated in 10 μg of cytoplasmic extracts and 80 units/ml RNasin (Promega, WI), and at timed intervals samples were removed and extracted by TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center). In some experiments recombinant AUF1, eluate from the RNA column, or Dynein light chain (M r 8000) (LC8) (6.0 μg), or BSA (6.0 μg) were added together with the cytosolic extracts. In some experiments excess of cold RNA was added. Transcript half-lives were calculated by densitometric imaging of the autoradiographs. The data were plotted and the point where there was a 50% reduction in intact transcript determined. Recombinant p40AUF1 was prepared according to Wilson and Brewer (14.Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 74-83Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with some modifications. An Escherichia coli DH5α clone containing pTrcHisB/p40AUF1 was induced to express plasmid encoded protein by culturing with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (MBI, Fermentas). His6-AUF1 fusion polypeptide was purified by resuspending the bacterial pellet with HNTA buffer (1 m NaCl, 50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonication and centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to 2 ml of ProBond resin (Invitrogen) that had been prewashed twice with double distilled water and once with NTA buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were spun down and washed with NTA buffer, and the His6-AUF1 protein was eluted with increasing concentration of imidazole (25–300 mm) in NTA buffer. Lysozyme (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to the eluates containing the His6AUF1 as the main polypeptide, and dialyzed against 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris HCl pH 7.5, 4 °C for 5 h. The eluates were then concentrated by Centricon 30 (Amicon) and the concentration of purified rAUF1 was determined by comparison with known amounts of BSA on Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The figures shown are representative gels of at least three repeat experiments. PTH mRNA levels are determined by RNA-binding proteins that interact with sequences in the 3′-UTR of the PTH mRNA. When there is less binding, then the RNA is more accessible to RNase activity (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Competition for the binding proteins with excess PTH mRNA 3′-UTR should lead to more rapid decay in anin vitro degradation assay of PTH RNA transcript and PT cytosolic extract. Excess PTH RNA 3′-UTR led to a dramatic decrease in PTH RNA stability (t 1/2 10 min, compared to 60 min with no competitor) (Fig. 1). Excess of a smaller transcript of 63 nt which contains the protein binding sequences in the 3′-UTR (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) also led to rapid degradation of the full-length, radiolabeled PTH RNA (t 1/2 <10 min) (Fig. 1). Addition of unlabeled PTH transcript that did not include the 3′-UTR as a control did not lead to a decrease in PTH RNA stability (Fig. 1). In fact, there was a slight increase in PTH RNA stability, which is not readily explainable. These results suggest that the binding region in the 3′-UTR competed for stabilizing factors in the PT protein extract, resulting in their depletion from the extract. This resulted in rapid degradation of the PTH transcript. We therefore performed experiments to characterize the binding proteins. To identify the proteins that bind to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR, we performed affinity chromatography. The proteins that bind the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR are present in all tissues examined (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We therefore used rat brain protein extracts and not the minute parathyroids as the source for the RNA-binding proteins. Rat brain S-100 extracts were chromatographed first on a heparin-Sepharose column to enrich for proteins that bind RNA. The fractions that showed maximum binding to the PTH 3′-UTR on UV cross-linking were then chromatographed on a PTH RNA affinity column. The affinity column consisted of cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose linked to in vitro transcribed PTH RNA 3′-UTR. The proteins that bound the 3′-UTR column were eluted with increasing salt concentrations and studied by UV cross-linking to the PTH 3′-UTR RNA probe (Fig.2 A). There were three protein-RNA bands, at about 50, 60, and 110 kDa, for brain and parathyroid, consistent with our earlier studies (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The proteins that eluted between 220 and 500 mm NaCl exhibited maximum binding (Fig. 2 A) and were combined and concentrated. A sample was run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was stained for protein by Ponceau. The staining revealed several bands (Fig. 2 B). To identify the RNA-binding proteins, the membrane was then incubated with a riboprobe for the PTH 3′-UTR for Northwestern analysis (Fig. 2 B). The PTH 3′-UTR showed the most intense binding to three of the proteins. There was one protein at approximately 60 kDA, two at about 50 kDa, and other less intense bands. To demonstrate the function of the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR-binding proteins on PTH mRNA stability, we performedin vitro degradation assays. In the presence of cytosol, there is gradual degradation of the transcript as seen previously in Fig. 1. We measured the effect of added eluate from the RNA column on the ability of PT protein extracts from hypophosphatemic rats to degrade PTH RNA in vitro. Hypophosphatemic PT proteins showed more rapid degradation of PTH RNA in an in vitrodegradation assay compared with PT proteins of control rats and also less binding to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Proteins from hypophosphatemic PTs are therefore depleted in stabilizing factors. Complete depletion of these factors from PT cytosolic proteins by 3′-UTR affinity chromatography is not practicable because of the small size of the rat PT gland, which would require the use of >150 rats for each experiment. The degradation assay was therefore performed with PT proteins from hypophosphatemic rats and increasing amounts of eluate (∼200 and 400 ng of protein) from the RNA column. The added eluate had no effect upon transcript stability at lower concentrations; however, higher concentrations of added eluate stabilized the PTH transcript throughout the experiment (t 1/2 80 min, compared to 30 min with no eluant) (Fig.3). The same stabilizing effect was also found when the eluate was added to PT cytosolic extracts from control rats (data not shown). These results show that proteins eluted from the RNA column stabilize the PTH transcript in vitroand that the eluate can overcome the degrading effect of the PT proteins from low phosphate rats, whose PT proteins show decreased binding to the PTH 3′-UTR. The eluate from the RNA column contained several proteins. One of the proteins at 50 kDa was present in the highest concentration (Fig.2 B). For this reason the 50-kDa protein was gel-purified and microsequenced generating five peptide sequences of 10–17 residues each. Data base search identified the polypeptide as being identical to AU-rich binding protein (AUF1), which is known to be important to the half-life of other mRNAs (reviewed in Ref. 15.Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The peptide sequences did not identify which of the AUF1 isoforms had been isolated. However, the binding assays suggests that the PTH RNA 3′-UTR bound all isoforms. One of these isoforms, p40AUF1, was further studied. The binding of recombinant AUF1 to the PTH RNA 3′-UTR was demonstrated by REMSA. Recombinant p40AUF1 bound the PTH 3′-UTR labeled transcript resulting in a shift of the RNA probe (Fig.4). The binding was enhanced by increasing concentrations of recombinant p40AUF1 (Fig. 4). Without protein the labeled transcript ran as two bands. These two bands may represent secondary structures of the RNA molecules because denaturing the RNA by heating it to 80 °C and then allowing it to renature at room temperature resulted in a single band on a polyacrylamide gel. This renatured probe bound p40AUF1 the same as the untreated transcript (data not shown). This indicates that p40AUF1 alone can bind the PTH 3′-UTR in the absence of other cytosolic proteins. To demonstrate the function of AUF1 in PTH mRNA stability we performed in vitrodegradation assays. The degradation assay was performed with PT proteins from hypophosphatemic rats and increasing amounts of p40AUF1. When recombinant p40AUF1 was added to the degradation assay in the presence of hypophosphatemic PT proteins, there was stabilization of the PTH transcript, which was dependent upon the amount of recombinant p40AUF1 added (Fig.5 A). At 50 ng, added AUF1 had no effect upon transcript stability; however, at higher concentrations addition of AUF1 stabilized the PTH transcript throughout the experiment (t 1/2 of 90 min with AUF1, and 30 min without AUF1) (Fig. 5 A). Fig. 5 B shows the degradation of the PTH transcript with PT proteins from both normal and hypophosphatemic rats, where there is more rapid degradation with hypophosphatemic parathyroid proteins (t 1/2 of 30 min with hypophosphatemic PT proteins, and 60 min with normal PT proteins). Addition of p40AUF1 to the hypophosphatemic proteins stabilized the transcript (t 1/2 >120 min) even more than when the degradation assay was performed in the presence of proteins from normal rats. Control proteins had no effect (Fig. 5 B). The control proteins used were BSA and LC8. LC8 also binds to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR (16.Epstein E. Sela-Brown A. Ringel I. Kilav R. King S.M. Benashski S. Yisraeli J.K. Silver J. Naveh-Many T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To understand the effect of AUF1 and the other proteins in the eluate on the degradation reaction, we added recombinant p40AUF1and the eluate to the reaction with hypophosphatemic proteins in concentrations where alone they had no effect on PTH RNA degradation (Figs. 3 and 5 A). The PTH RNA was now markedly stabilized (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, there is an additive effect of p40AUF1 and the RNA-binding proteins eluted from the RNA column. The post-transcriptional regulation of PTH gene expression by calcium and phosphate is mediated by the binding of cytosolic proteins to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR (10.Moallem E. Silver J. Kilav R. Naveh-Many T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5253-5259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We have now identified one of the proteins that bind to the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR by RNA affinity chromatography and microsequencing as AUF1. Recombinant p40AUF1 bound the PTH mRNA 3′-UTR by REMSA. There is no PT cell line; therefore, to demonstrate that AUF1 has a functional role in determining PTH mRNA stability, we performed in vitrodegradation assays. Addition of p40AUF1, with PT cytosolic extracts, stabilized the PTH transcript. Surprisingly, immunodepletion of rAUF1 from PT cytosolic extracts had no little or no effect on degradation of the transcript (data not shown). This result may reflect functional redundancy in the PT cytosolic extracts, in that only AUF1 was depleted and not the other PTH mRNA-binding proteins. In hypophosphatemia there are decreased binding in three parathyroid protein-PTH RNA species, and a less stable transcript. This suggests that all three protein-RNA species seen by UV cross-linking are involved in determining the RNA stability. To deplete all the PTH RNA 3′-UTR-binding proteins from the PT cytosolic extract, we added excess PTH RNA 3′-UTR, or a smaller transcript of 63 nt that is sufficient for binding, to the degradation assay of PTH RNA with PT proteins (Fig. 1). This resulted in a rapid degradation of the PTH RNA, suggesting competition for the stabilizing proteins. Polysomal associated in vitro degradation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mRNA was similarly enhanced by AUUUA-containing competitor RNA (17.Rajagopalan L.E. Burkholder J.K. Turner J. Culp J. Yang N.S. Malter J.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Rajagopalan L.E. Malter J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 257-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The addition of the competitor RNA depleted the polysome associated AU-binding protein, which stabilized the GM-CSF mRNA by masking AUUUA motifs. The short half-life of many proto-oncogenes and cytokines is mediated in part by the rapid turnover of their mRNAs (15.Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A+U-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated regions of these mRNAs serve as one recognition signal targeting the mRNAs for rapid degradation. AUF1 is a cytosolic protein that both binds to the proto-oncogene c-myc A+U-rich element (ARE) and specifically destabilized c-myc mRNA in a cell-free mRNA decay system, which reconstituted mRNA decay processes found in cells (19.Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ARE binding affinities of AUF1 correlated with the potency of an ARE to direct degradation of a heterologous mRNA (20.DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These studies established a role for AUF1 in ARE-directed mRNA decay that is based upon its affinity for different AREs. The role of AUF1 in mRNA decay is not restricted to proto-oncogenes. The developmental immaturity of neonatal phagocytic function is associated with a shorter half-life of GM-CSF mRNA.In vitro the decay of the GM-CSF in mononuclear cells is also unstable, and this instability was accelerated by protein fractions enriched for AUF1 (21.Buzby J.S. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, this accelerated ARE-dependent decay of the GM-CSF 3′-UTR was attenuated by immunodepletion of AUF1, thereby demonstrating that the in vitro RNA decay is ARE- and AUF1-dependent (21.Buzby J.S. Brewer G. Nugent D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33973-33978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Anti-AUF1 immunoblotting showed significantly higher levels of two AUF1 protein isoforms and lower levels of one in cord than in adult mononuclear cell extracts. The results suggested that increased levels of specific AUF1 isoforms in cord mononuclear cells destabilized the GM-CSF mRNA by targeting it for increased degradation (22.Buzby J.S. Lee S.M. Van Winkle P. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Cairo M.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ARE destabilizing function in K562 cells was dramatically impeded during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation (23.Loflin P. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of hnRNP D/AUF1 in hemin-treated K562 cells restored the rapid decay directed by the ARE. The extent of destabilizing effect varied among the four isoforms of AUF1, with p37 and p42 displaying the most profound effect. These results demonstrated a specific cytoplasmic function for AUF1 as an RNA-destabilizing protein in ARE-mediated decay pathway. In contrast to the role of AUF1 in the rapid degradation of mRNAs, it may have a role in the stabilization of other mRNAs, such as α-globin mRNA. Kiledjian et al. (24.Kiledjian M. DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. Novick K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified AUF1 as one of the proteins that, together with two other proteins, α CP1 and α CP2, bind to the 3′-UTR of the α-globin mRNA and regulate the erythrocyte-specific accumulation of α-globin mRNA. Alone, none of these proteins can bind the α-globin 3′-UTR, and they only bind when they are complexed with the other proteins of the α-complex. However, Chkheidze et al. (25.Chkheidze A.N. Lyakhov D.L. Makeyev A.V. Morales J. Kong J. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4572-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that in α-globin 3′-UTR the poly(C)-binding proteins, α CPs, were quantitatively incorporated into the α-complex in the absence of AUF1, suggesting that AUF1 may not be essential for the protein-RNA complex formation. We have now shown that AUF1 binds PTH mRNA 3′-UTR and determines PTH mRNA stability. The PTH mRNA 3′-UTR has a region that is rich in A and U but does not have the classical ARE configuration. The PTH mRNA ARE is an example of a regulatory element, which is stabilized by AUF1 and other parathyroid cytosolic RNA-binding proteins. RNA-protein binding regulates PTH mRNA levels in response to changes in serum calcium and phosphate. The role of AUF1 in the regulation of PTH mRNA stability in response to changes in serum calcium and phosphate remains to be determined.

https://openalex.org/W2043544340,"Bone marrow-derived macrophages proliferate in response to specific growth factors, including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). When stimulated with activating factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages stop proliferating and produce proinflammatory cytokines. Although triggering opposed responses, both M-CSF and LPS induce the activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2. However, the time-course of ERK activation is different; maximal activation by M-CSF and LPS occurred after 5 and 15 min of stimulation, respectively. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and TPA, all of which induced macrophage proliferation, also induced ERK activity, which was maximal at 5 min poststimulation. The use of PD98059, which specifically blocks ERK 1 and 2 activation, demonstrated that ERK activity was necessary for macrophage proliferation in response to these factors. The treatment with phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibited macrophage proliferation, induced the expression of cytokines, and triggered a pattern of ERK activation equivalent to that induced by LPS. Moreover, PD98059 inhibited the expression of cytokines induced by LPS or PC-PLC, thus suggesting that ERK activity is also required for macrophage activation by these two agents. Activation of the JNK pathway did not discriminate between proliferative and activating stimuli. In conclusion, our results allow to correlate the differences in the time-course of ERK activity with the macrophagic response toward proliferation or activation. Bone marrow-derived macrophages proliferate in response to specific growth factors, including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). When stimulated with activating factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages stop proliferating and produce proinflammatory cytokines. Although triggering opposed responses, both M-CSF and LPS induce the activation of extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1 and 2. However, the time-course of ERK activation is different; maximal activation by M-CSF and LPS occurred after 5 and 15 min of stimulation, respectively. Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and TPA, all of which induced macrophage proliferation, also induced ERK activity, which was maximal at 5 min poststimulation. The use of PD98059, which specifically blocks ERK 1 and 2 activation, demonstrated that ERK activity was necessary for macrophage proliferation in response to these factors. The treatment with phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibited macrophage proliferation, induced the expression of cytokines, and triggered a pattern of ERK activation equivalent to that induced by LPS. Moreover, PD98059 inhibited the expression of cytokines induced by LPS or PC-PLC, thus suggesting that ERK activity is also required for macrophage activation by these two agents. Activation of the JNK pathway did not discriminate between proliferative and activating stimuli. In conclusion, our results allow to correlate the differences in the time-course of ERK activity with the macrophagic response toward proliferation or activation. macrophage colony-stimulating factor extracellular-regulated kinase granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor interleukin c-Jun N-terminal kinase lipopolysaccharide mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK/ERK kinase phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C tumor necrosis factor-α 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate Macrophages perform critical functions in the immune system. They act as regulators of homeostasis and as effector cells in infection, wounding, and tumor growth (1.Celada A. Nathan C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 15: 100-102Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Macrophages originate in the bone marrow and, through the blood stream, reach all the tissues in the organism. According to the specific needs, tissue macrophages either proliferate, further differentiate to more specialized macrophagic populations, or become activated. When there is no need of macrophages and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)1 is not locally produced, these cells undergo a process of apoptotic death (2.Xaus J. Cardó M. Valledor A.F. Soler C. Lloberas J. Celada A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). M-CSF is the major and the only specific growth factor for this cell type (3.Stanley E.R. Berg K.L. Einstein D.B. Lee P.S.W. Pixley F.J. Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 46: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The receptor for M-CSF is the product of the proto-oncogenec-fms (4.Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 362-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The binding of M-CSF induces the autophosphorylation of the receptor and the subsequent recruitment of different signal transducing molecules (reviewed in Ref. 5.Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 313-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One of the signaling cascades activated by M-CSF is the Raf/MEK/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (6.Büscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7.Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P.P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem.

Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERKs 1 and 2 (9.Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). These are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases, also known as p44- and p42-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), respectively (10.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar). Active ERKs phosphorylate and regulate several cellular proteins, including additional protein kinases, cytoskeletal components, phospholipase A2, and nuclear transcription factors, such as Elk1/TCF and c-Jun, which regulate the expression of immediate early genes (10.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar, 11.Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin, a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, activates macrophages and induces the secretion of arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g.prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor), nitrogen intermediates, and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukins 1 and 6 (12.Adams D.O. Hamilton T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 283-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 13.Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Annu. Rev. Med. 1987; 38: 417-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which play important roles in the immune response. LPS triggers the activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in macrophages (14.Reimann T.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our aim is to determine the mechanism(s) that induces macrophages to either proliferate or become activated. In this study, we have found that both proliferating and activating processes in macrophages require the activation of the ERK cascade. However, the time-course of this activation is markedly different. Because the time-course of ERK activity may determine the fate of certain cellular responses (16.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar, 17.Sarbassov D.D. Jones L.G. Peterson C.A. Mol.

J. 1998; 330: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), we were interested in finding out a correlation between the pattern of ERK activation and the cellular response (proliferationversus activation) induced in macrophages. In this regard, the proliferating agents M-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-3, and TPA induced a peak of ERK activity at 5 min of stimulation. In contrast, the activating agents LPS and exogenous PC-PLC, both of which blocked macrophage proliferation, induced ERK activation more slowly, with maximal induction at 15 min poststimulation. In contrast, we could not correlate the pattern of JNK activity with any particular macrophagic fate. In conclusion, in this report we show that differences in the time-course of ERK activity may be crucial in determining the macrophage response toward proliferation or activation; the macrophage response is the initial peak of ERK activity common to all the proliferative processes and the more delayed peak induced by activating agents. Recombinant M-CSF was provided as a gift by DNAX (Palo Alto, CA). In some experiments, we used L-cell conditioned medium as the source of this growth factor. PC-PLC from Bacillus cereus and TPA were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Recombinant GM-CSF and LPS were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant IL-3 was purchased from R&D systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). All reagents were used following the manufacturer's recommendations. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained from 6–10-week-old Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA) as described (19.Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) and 30% L-cell conditioned medium as a source of M-CSF. Once macrophages were 80% confluent, normally after 6 days of culture, they were deprived of L-cell conditioned medium for 16–18 h and treated with either growth or activating factors in the presence or absence of selective inhibitors/activators. Name of the treatments were not toxic for the cells, as determined by trypan blue exclusion or by flow cytometry analysis. Cell proliferation was measured as described previously (20.Celada A. Maki R.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1102-1105PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Celada A. Borràs F.E. Soler C. Lloberas J. Klemsz M. van Beveren C. McKercher S. Maki R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Quiescent cells (105) were incubated for 24 h in 24-well plates (3424 MARK II; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) in 1 ml of medium with the indicated concentrations of M-CSF. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 0.5 ml of medium containing [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml) (ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). After 4–6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% methanol. After three washes in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, the cells were solubilized in 1% SDS and 0.3m NaOH at room temperature. Radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation using a 1400 Tri-Carb Packard scintillation counter. Each point was performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. The cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extraction of total RNA was performed as described (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). Total RNA samples (15 μg) were separated on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Genescreen, NEN Life Science Products). For TNF-α mRNA detection, we used the EcoRI/HindIII fragment of pSP65/TNF-α (kindly supplied by Dr. M. Nabholz, ISREC, Epalinges, Switzerland). To study the expression of IL-1β, we obtained a probe by digesting the construct pGEM1/IL-1β (kindly provided by Dr. R. Wilson, Glaxo Research and Development Ltd., Greenford, United Kingdom) with EcoRI/PstI. The expression of IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by using as a probe theEcoRI/BglII fragment of pBS/IL-6 (kindly supplied by Dr. S. Rohatgi, Center for Blood Research, Boston, MA). To detect the L32 transcript, we used the EcoRI/HindIII fragment of pGEM1/L32 as a probe (23.Celada A. Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA). After incubating in hybridization solution (20% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSC, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 25 mm Na2HPO4, 25 mmNaH2PO4, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 65 °C, membranes were exposed to Kodak X-AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Bands of interest were quantified with a Molecular Analyst System (Bio-Rad). The cells were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with lysis solution (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml iodacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The analysis of ERK activity was performed as described (24.Chao T.-S.O. Byron K.L. Lee K.-M. Villereal M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19876-19883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of total protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE containing 0.1 mg/ml of myelin basic protein (Sigma) co-polymerized in the gel. After electrophoresis, SDS was removed by washing the gel with two changes of 20% 2-propanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 1 h at room temperature. The gel was then incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) for 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were denatured by incubating the gel with two changes of 6m guanidine-HCl for 1 h at room temperature and then renatured by incubating it with five changes of Buffer A containing 0.04% Tween-20 for 16 h at 4 °C. To perform the phosphorylation assay, the gel was first equilibrated in 40 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) containing 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 15 mmMgCl2, 300 μm sodium orthovanadate for 30 min at 25 °C and then incubated in the same solution but also containing 50 μm ATP and 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN). The reaction was terminated by washing the gel with 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate to inhibit phosphatase activity. The gel was dried, exposed to x-ray films (Kodak), and quantitated with a Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad). This assay was performed as described (25.Caelles C. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Munoz A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3351-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 10 mmEGTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml iodacetamide). 150 μg of total protein were mixed with 75 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose and 1 μl of anti-JNK1 antibody (sc-474, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in a total volume of 500 μl. The samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, once with cold JNK buffer (20 mm Hepes-Na, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol), and resuspended in JNK reaction buffer (JNK buffer supplemented with 1 μg of GST-c-Jun (1–169) (Calbiochem) as a substrate, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and was then stopped by adding 12 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. The samples were incubated for 3 min at 100 °C and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After the electrophoresis, the gels were fixed in isopropanol:water:acetic acid (25:65:10), dried and exposed to Kodak X-AR films. In this work, we have used bone marrow-derived macrophages because they represent a homogeneous population of primary macrophages that can either proliferate efficiently in response to M-CSF or become activated in response to LPS. Both agents induce the activity of ERK kinases. To determine the involvement of ERK activation in the response to M-CSF or LPS, we used PD98059, an inhibitor specific for the ERK kinase (MEK-1) (26.Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). The preincubation with PD98059 inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the activation of ERK 1 and 2 induced by M-CSF (Fig. 1 A). The percentage of inhibition of ERK activity correlated with the capability of PD98059 to block the proliferation of quiescent bone marrow macrophages as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 1 B). The inhibition of macrophage proliferation was also observed by cell counting (Fig. 1 C). The maximal inhibition of both ERK activation and macrophage proliferation was obtained at a PD98059 concentration of 50 μm. We have previously observed that macrophages do not undergo a process of apoptosis upon exposure to this concentration of the inhibitor (29.Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar). In the same studies, we found that PD98059 did not alter certain cellular processes, such as the induction of the phosphatase MAPK phosphatase-1. Taken together, our results indicate that the effect of PD98059 on macrophage proliferation is specifically mediated by the inhibition of ERK activation rather than by a general toxic effect. For subsequent experiments, we used 50 μm PD98059 to fully inhibit ERK activation in macrophages. We further extended our investigations to analyze the involvement of ERK 1 and 2 activity in the macrophage activation by LPS. Preincubation of macrophages with PD98059 also abolished the activation of ERK 1 and 2 by LPS (Fig. 1 D). The treatment with this compound inhibited the LPS-induced expression of IL-1β and IL-6 (Fig. 1,E and F). In addition, the blockage of ERK activation had also an inhibitory effect on the late induction of TNF-α by LPS. These results suggest that activation of ERK 1 and 2 is required for the correct induction of cytokines during the macrophagic response to LPS. We next determined the time-course of ERK activation in response to M-CSF or LPS. Using an in-gel kinase assay, we detected ERK 1 and 2 activity as early as 2 min after the stimulation with M-CSF; it peaked at 5 min and decreased progressively thereafter (Fig.2 A). By contrast to the M-CSF signal transduction, we did not detect ERK activation within the first 5 min of stimulation with LPS (Fig. 2 B). Instead, ERK 1 and 2 activity started to be detected at 10 min and peaked at 15 min of LPS treatment. Therefore, important differences were observed between the time-course of ERK 1 and 2 activity induced by M-CSF and LPS; the former was more rapidly induced by the proliferating factor than by the activating agent. These results were confirmed by mobility shift assays (data not shown). In order to determine whether differences in the time-course of ERK activation had any specific relationship with the macrophagic response toward proliferation versus activation, we tested the effect of other growth factors. Although M-CSF is the major and specific growth factor for macrophages, these cells are also able to proliferate in response to GM-CSF and IL-3 (Fig. 3,A and B). However, the signaling pathways induced after the binding of these growth factors to their specific receptors (27.deGroop R.P. Coffer P.J. Koenderman L. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28.Miyahima A. Kinoshita T. Wakao H. Hara T. Yoshimura A. Nishinakamura R. Murray R. Mui A. Leukemia. 1997; 11 Suppl. 3: 418-422PubMed Google Scholar) is different from that induced by the M-CSF receptor (5.Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 313-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As shown above for the M-CSF-induced response, the macrophage proliferation induced by GM-CSF or IL-3 was also blocked by the use of the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3, A–D). This indicates that ERK activation is required for this process. The inhibition of macrophage proliferation is not due to a general toxic effect of PD98059, because in previous experiments, this compound did not reduce macrophage viability or induce macrophage apoptosis (data not shown). In addition, a number of cellular responses, such as the induction of MAPK phosphatase-1, were not modified by this inhibitor (29.Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine any correlation between the earliest peak of ERK activity and macrophage proliferation, we studied the pattern of ERK activation in response to GM-CSF and IL-3. The treatment of macrophages with either one of these two growth factors induced the activation of ERK 1 and 2 within the first 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 3, Eand F). This activation was extended up for 10 min more and thereafter decayed to basal levels. Moreover, we studied the effect of the phorbol ester TPA. This agent induced the proliferation of quiescent bone marrow macrophages (Fig.4 A). Interestingly, macrophage proliferation induced by TPA was inhibited by the pretreatment with PD98059 (Fig. 4, A and B). We also compared the effect of TPA with that of LPS on macrophage activation and found that in bone marrow macrophages, TPA was a much weaker inducer of the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β (Fig.4 C). Our results suggest that in macrophages, TPA plays a more important role as an inducer of proliferation than as an activating factor. When the time-course of ERK activation was analyzed, a peak of ERK 1 and 2 activity was detected within the first 5 min of stimulation with TPA (Fig. 4 D). Taken together, our results suggest that in macrophages, the earliest peak of ERK activation is a common feature induced by mitogenic factors. Next, we were interested in assessing whether other agents that mimic the effect of LPS also induced a similar pattern of ERK activation. Although IFN-γ is the major macrophage activating factor, it induces different functional activities than LPS. In fact, no ERK activity was detected in macrophages stimulated with IFN-γ (data not shown). Interestingly, the incubation of macrophages with exogenous PC-PLC fromB. cereus induced potently and very quickly the mRNA expression of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β (Fig.5 A). This induction was partially inhibited by the use of PD98059 (Fig. 5 A), thus suggesting that ERK activation was involved in this event. The effect of PC-PLC on macrophage proliferation was also analyzed. The treatment with PC-PLC alone did not induce proliferation on quiescent macrophages (Fig. 5 B). Because macrophage activation is linked to a loss of proliferation, as demonstrated by the treatment of macrophages with M-CSF and LPS simultaneously (Fig. 5 C), the effect of exogenous PC-PLC on the M-CSF-induced proliferation of macrophages was also studied. In fact, PC-PLC significantly inhibited macrophage proliferation in response to M-CSF (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these results indicate that exogenous PC-PLC acts as a macrophage activating agent. This effect was not due to contaminating LPS in the PC-PLC samples because autoclaved PC-PLC aliquots lost their capability to induce macrophage activation (data not shown). Therefore, we analyzed the time-course of ERK activation induced by this agent and compared it with that triggered by LPS. PC-PLC mimicked the time-course of ERK activity induced by LPS, with maximal activation after 15 min of stimulation (Fig. 5 D). These results further supported our hypothesis that the pattern of ERK activation helped to define the macrophage response toward proliferation or activation. We were also interested in analyzing whether the time-course of activation of the JNK pathway could also play a role in determining the macrophage dichotomy between proliferation and activation. Interestingly, both M-CSF and LPS induced JNK activity, as assessed by an in vitro kinase assay (Fig.6). However, the time-course of this activation was virtually identical. JNK1 activity was not detected during the first 5 min of stimulation, peaked at 15 min, remained elevated at 30 min, and thereafter decayed to basal levels. PC-PLC was also observed to induce JNK activity in a similar way. In contrast, TPA did not induce detectable JNK activity in macrophages. Therefore, we found no tight correlation between the capability of a certain agent to induce JNK activity and its effect on macrophage biology. Lymphocytes undergo a clonal expansion when they are activated either after interaction with a peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (T cells) or after the direct recognition of an antigen (B cells) (30.Neuberger M.S. Cell. 1997; 90: 971-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, macrophages cannot simultaneously proliferate and become activated. In fact, macrophage activation is linked to a growth arrest and an enhancement of their ability to perform specialized functions in the immune system. Our goal is to determine the signaling mechanisms that induce macrophages to either proliferate or become activated. In this report, we have used bone marrow-derived macrophages because they constitute a homogeneous population of primary macrophages. An advantage over macrophagic cell lines is that bone marrow macrophages can be rendered quiescent by removing M-CSF from the medium and then induced to proliferate efficiently in response to growth factors. In addition, these cells become activated after exposure to activating agents, such as LPS. One of the main properties of the activation of macrophages by LPS is the production of proinflammatory cytokines that help resolve the immune response against microorganisms. However, although representing a suitable model for studying several aspects of the regulation of macrophage proliferation versusactivation, at present, transfection of these primary cultures is very inefficient (21.Celada A. Borràs F.E. Soler C. Lloberas J. Klemsz M. van Beveren C. McKercher S. Maki R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For this reason, we need to use chemical inhibitors to assay the involvement of specific molecules in macrophage biology. In this report, we have shown that in macrophages, activation of ERK 1 and 2 is necessary for the proliferative processes induced by different growth factors, including M-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3, and by the tumor promoting agent TPA. The activation of these kinases is also necessary for the proliferation of other cell types in response to specific growth factors or serum (31.Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). The inhibition of this pathway led to a growth arrest of macrophages at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, without inducing apoptosis (29.Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that activation of ERK 1 and 2 by LPS is required for the correct induction of the cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and, to a lesser extent, TNF-α. These results complement recent observations in human monocytes, in which blockage of the ERK pathway inhibited the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α (33.Foey A.D. Parry S.L. Williams L.M. Feldmann M. Foxwell B.M. Brennan F.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 920-928PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Scherle P.A. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Daulerio A.J. Covington M.B. Nurnberg S.A. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5681-5686PubMed Google Scholar). We have also found that the treatment with exogenous PC-PLC mimics some of the aspects of the macrophage activation by LPS, including the growth arrest and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Again, ERK activity was required for the normal expression of TNF-α and IL-1β induced by PC-PLC. These observations contrast with the mitogenic effect attributed to the treatment with exogenous PC-PLC in some other cellular system (35.Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although our data do not allow us to conclude that endogenous PC-PLC plays a major role in the context of macrophage activation, the results shown here are in agreement with the findings that mouse septic shock during Gram-negative bacterial infections can be down-modulated by the blockage of PC-PLC activation (36.Tschaikowsky K. Schmidt J. Meisner M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 800-804PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both proliferating and activating agents induced ERK activity in macrophages does not reduce the importance of these kinases in the regulation of these two processes. In fact, we have shown that the time-course of ERK activity was markedly different in one case or the other. Our results confirm previous observations that LPS and M-CSF induced two distinct patterns of ERK activation in macrophages (7.Jaworowski A. Christy E. Yusoff P.P. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For the first time, we have demonstrated that GM-CSF, IL-3, and TPA, which induce macrophage proliferation, trigger a pattern of ERK activation similar to that induced by M-CSF, with an early peak of ERK 1 and 2 activity within the first 5 min of stimulation. In contrast, LPS and PC-PLC, which inhibited macrophage proliferation and induced the expression of cytokines, triggered a more delayed peak of ERK activation, which was maximal after 15 min of stimulation. The mechanisms by which the proliferating agents induce an earlier peak of ERK activation in comparison to that induced by the activating agents may be a consequence of the usage of different pathways to activate the ERK cascade. In BAC1.2F5 macrophages, ERK activation by M-CSF was postulated to be mediated by both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms, whereas the activation by LPS partially involved the action of a PLC isoform specific for phosphatidylcholine (6.Büscher D. Hipskind R.A. Krautwald S. Reimann T. Baccarini M. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1995; 15: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These observations are in agreement with our finding that the treatment of macrophages with exogenous PC-PLC induces a time-course of ERK activation similar to that induced during the macrophage response to LPS. Our results also indicate that although M-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 have been shown to activate different signaling molecules, e.g. signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 in response to M-CSF (5.Hamilton J.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 313-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,38.Hamilton J.A. J. Leuk. Biol. 1997; 62: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) versus signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 in response to GM-CSF (39.Feldman G.M. Rosenthal L.A. Liu X. Hayes M.P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Leonard W.J. Henninghausen L. Flinbloom D.S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1768-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or IL-3 (40.Hara T. Miyajima A. Stem Cells. 1996; 14: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), convergence at the level of ERK activation exists between the different macrophage mitogenic networks. We are currently investigating the mechanisms downstream or in parallel to ERK 1 and 2 that may help define a certain cellular response, depending on the time-course of ERK activation. The fact that a particular pattern of ERK activity correlates with a specific macrophage response does not necessarily mean that ERK 1 and 2 are the unique regulator of that process. In fact, the blockage of ERK activation did not result in a complete inhibition of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in any of the systems tested. Our results point to an involvement of ERK activity in the determination of the fate of the macrophage response rather than on the extent of the final response itself. We should also think on the existence of finely regulated interactions between active ERK 1 and 2 and other signaling molecules, most probably transiently switched on, in order to regulate gene transcription leading to a specific macrophage response. In this regard, other members of the MAPK group of kinases, such as JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, have been also implicated in the control of proliferation (41.Bost F. McKay R. Dean N. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 42.Auer K.L. Contessa J. Brenz-Verca S. Pirola L. Rusconi S. Cooper G. Abo A.

Unfortunately, we have not been able to demonstrate any tight correlation between the activation of the JNK pathway and the macrophage response toward proliferation or activation. However, we are currently assessing whether these kinases play a role in synergy to ERK 1 and 2 in the control of cytokine expression in response to LPS or PC-PLC. Taken together, our results allow us to reach two important conclusions. First, the ERK pathway is required both for macrophage proliferation and for the correct production of cytokines during macrophage activation. And second, a clear correlation exists between the time-course of ERK activation and the decision of macrophages to either proliferate or become activated; this decision is the initial peak of ERK activation common to all the proliferative signals and the more delayed peak induced by activating agents. Our results suggest a crucial role for the ERK pathway in the control of this dichotomy. We thank Drs. Rich A. Maki (Neurocrine, La Jolla, CA), and Jorge Moscat, and M.

https://openalex.org/W2332138840,"The E1B-55K and E4orf6 oncoproteins of adenovirus type 5 are involved in the export of viral mRNAs. Previously, it was suggested that a complex composed of E1B-55K and E4orf6 serves as a nucleocytoplasmic transporter for viral mRNAs in which the E4orf6 protein directs both nuclear import and export. We now demonstrate that the E1B-55K protein itself shuttles efficiently in the absence of E4orf6. In addition, E1B-55K trafficking was independent of the defined shuttle proteins Mdm2 or p53, which interacts with E1B-55K. The identified N-terminal E1B-55K leucine-rich nuclear-export signal (NES) conferred rapid nuclear export even in a heterologous system in contrast to the postulated E4orf6NES. Interestingly, although shuttling was blocked by inhibitors of the CRM1 mediated export pathway, E1B-55K inhibited neither the activity nor the trafficking of the retroviral shuttle proteins HIV-1 Rev and HTLV-1 Rex. In contrast, Rev or Rex blocked the nuclear export of E1B-55K, most likely by competing for essential export factors. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of the adenovirus mRNA export system and the processes of adenovirus mediated transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2329798361,"Mammary tumorigenesis was analysed in transgenic mice which overexpress des(1-3)hIGF-I (WAP-DES) and/or a mutant form of p53 (p53172R-H). Nonlactating, multiparous WAP-DES mice exhibited hyperplastic lesions termed mammary interepithelial neoplasia (MIN) which constitutively expressed WAP-DES. By 23 months of age, 53% of the WAP-DES mice developed mammary adenocarcinomas. A 75% reduction in both apoptosis and proliferation was observed in the normal mammary glands of WAP-DES mice. Mammary tumor incidence in WAP-DES/p53 bitransgenic mice was similar to that of WAP-DES and 2–3-fold greater than that of nontransgenic and p53172R-H females. Tumor latency, however, was reduced by 8 months in bitransgenic mice as compared to mice of the other three genotypes. Aneuploidy was frequently observed in tumors from bitransgenic and p53172R-H mice, but not from mice expressing only the WAP-DES transgene. Expression of IGFBP3 was elevated in tumors from WAP-DES, but not bitransgenic mice, indicating an alteration in the p53/IGF-I axis. These studies indicate that overexpression of des(1-3)hIGF-I increases the frequency of MIN and stochastic mammary tumors and that the appearance of tumors displaying genomic instability is accelerated by mutant p53172R-H."

https://openalex.org/W2050900335,"Oncogenic mutations in ras lead to constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways that modulate the activities of transcription factors. In turn, these factors control the expression of a subset of genes responsible for neoplastic cell transformation. Recent studies suggest that transcription factor NF-kappa B contributes to cell transformation by inhibiting the cell death signal activated by oncogenic Ras. In this study, inhibition of NF-kappa B activity by forced expression of a super-repressor form of I kappa B alpha, the major inhibitor of NF-kappa B, markedly decreased the growth rate, saturation density and tumorigenicity of oncogenic H-Ras transformed rat embryo fibroblasts. Such clonally isolated cells overexpressing I kappa B alpha super-repressor not only were viable but also exhibited no sign of spontaneous apoptosis. Inhibition of NF-kappa B in these cells was functionally demonstrated by both the loss of cytokine induced DNA binding activity and a profoundly increased sensitivity to cell death in response to TNF-alpha treatment. In contrast, inhibition of NF-kappa B activity in non-transformed fibroblasts had minimal effect on growth, but rendered the cells resistant to a subsequent transformation by H-ras oncogene. Similar results were also obtained with rat intestinal epithelial cells harboring an inducible ras oncogene. Taken together, these findings suggest that NF-kappa B activity is essential for abnormal cell proliferation and tumorigenicity activated by the ras oncogene and highlight an alternative functional role for NF-kappa B in oncogenic Ras-mediated cell transformation that is distinct from its anti-apoptotic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2070385982,"The penultimate step in carnitine biosynthesis is mediated by γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (EC1.2.1.47), a cytosolic NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase that converts γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde into γ-butyrobetaine. This enzyme was purified from rat liver, and two internal peptide fragments were sequenced by Edman degradation. The peptide sequences were used to search the Expressed Sequence Tag data base, which led to the identification of a rat cDNA containing an open reading frame of 1485 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 494 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 55 kDa.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 2.McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Furthermore, carnitine is involved in the transfer of the products of peroxisomal β-oxidation, including acetyl-CoA, to the mitochondria for oxidation to CO2 and H2O in the Krebs cycle (3.Jakobs B.S. Wanders R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 4.Verhoeven N.M. Roe D.S. Kok R.M. Wanders R.J. Jakobs C. Roe C.R. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the dietary intake of carnitine, most eukaryotes are able to synthesize this compound from trimethyllysine (5.Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 6.Kaufman R.A. Broquist H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7437-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lindstedt G. Lindstedt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4178-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This trimethyllysine is generated by the hydrolysis of proteins containing lysines that are trimethylated at their ε-amino group by a protein-dependent methyltransferase usingS-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. In the carnitine biosynthetic pathway, trimethyllysine is first hydroxylated at the β-position by ε-trimethyllysine hydroxylase, after which the resulting β-hydroxytrimethyllysine is cleaved by a specific aldolase into γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde and glycine. γ-Trimethylaminobutyraldehyde is subsequently oxidized by γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (TMABA-DH)1 to form γ-butyrobetaine (8.Hulse J.D. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the last step, γ-butyrobetaine is hydroxylated at the β-position by a second hydroxylase, γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, yielding l-carnitine (5.Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 9.Englard S. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,10.Rebouche C.J. Engel A.G. Biochim.

In rat and mouse, γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase is exclusively localized in the liver, whereas in man, the enzyme is present in kidney, liver, and brain. Although most tissues are capable of converting trimethyllysine into γ-butyrobetaine, liver and kidney are the main sites of carnitine biosynthesis in all animals (9.Englard S. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10.Rebouche C.J. Engel A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11.Englard S.

Chem. 1977; 252: 7437-7439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate that γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde is an intermediate in the carnitine biosynthesis of Neurospora crassa using isotope labeling experiments, and they suggested that an aldehyde dehydrogenase mediates its conversion to γ-butyrobetaine. Perfusion experiments showed that γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde is readily absorbed by rat liver and converted to carnitine via γ-butyrobetaine, demonstrating the conservation of the dehydrogenation step in higher eukaryotes (14.Zaspel B.J. Sheridan K.J. Henderson L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 631: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Rebouche and Engel (10.Rebouche C.J. Engel A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) showed that TMABA-DH activity was present in the cytosolic fraction of human liver, kidney, brain, heart, and muscle homogenates. In the same year, Hulse and Henderson (8.Hulse J.D. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified a cytosolic NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase from bovine liver showing maximum activity with γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde, converting it into γ-butyrobetaine. Except for the human γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, which has recently been identified in our laboratory (15.Vaz F.M. van Gool S. Ofman R. Ijlst L. Wanders R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), none of the enzymes of the carnitine biosynthetic route have been characterized at the molecular level. We therefore purified the aldehyde dehydrogenase responsible for the conversion of γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde to γ-butyrobetaine from rat liver and determined part of its amino acid sequence. Using this sequence information we identified the cDNAs encoding TMABA-DH from rat, human, and mouse. Finally, we expressed the cDNAs in Escherichia coli and compared the substrate specificities of the recombinant enzymes with those of the purified rat liver trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase. 4-Aminobutyraldehydediethylacetal, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphtalene, methyliodide, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, methanal, ethanal, propanal, butanal, pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, and betaine aldehyde chloride were from Sigma. NAD+ and NADH were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hexadecanal and octadecanal were synthesized as described earlier (16.Rizzo W.B. Craft D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). SP-Sepharose fast flow and red-Sepharose CL-6B were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and CHT-II hydroxylapatite was from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were of analytical grade. The pMAL-C2X vector was purchased from New England Biolabs (Herts, UK). 4-Aminobutyraldehyde diethylacetal was trimethylated in ethyl acetate using methyliodide in the presence of 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphatalene (proton sponge). The iodide salt of 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde diethylacetal precipitated together with the protonated proton sponge. This precipitate was subsequently dissolved in distilled water by heating the mixture in a boiling water bath. After slow cooling to room temperature, only the protonated proton sponge crystallized, whereas 4-N-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde diethylacetal remained in solution. After removal of the proton sponge by filtration, the process was repeated five times in smaller volumes of distilled water to completely remove the remainder of the proton sponge. Hydrolysis of the resulting acetal in 0.1 m HCl for 30 min at room temperature gave γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. Water and HCl were evaporated in a rotavapor, and the γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde was taken up in distilled water. In solution, γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde was stable for at least three months at −20 °C. TMABA-DH activity was determined either spectrophotometrically or fluorometrically at 37 °C by monitoring the formation of NADH using a centrifugal analyzer (COBAS FARA; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The assay mixture used in both methods contained 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate buffer at pH 9.0, 0.5 mm NAD+, and the enzyme sample in a final volume of 250 μl. The reaction was started by adding γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde to a final concentration of 100 μm, unless otherwise indicated. In the spectrophotometric assay, the increase in absorbance at 340 nm was measured, and the activity was calculated using 6220 m−1cm−1 as the molar extinction coefficient of NADH. In the fluorometric method, NADH formation was detected by measuring the fluorescence at 450 nm after excitation at 340 nm. Standard solutions of NADH were used for calibration. Livers were taken from Wistar rats and homogenized by five strokes of a Teflon pestle in a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer at 500 rpm in a 5 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.25 m sucrose and 2 mm EDTA. The crude homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × gat 4 °C to remove nuclei and whole cells. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged for 3 h at 20.000 × gat 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic fraction. The cytosolic fraction was applied to an SP-Sepharose fast flow column (inner diameter =2.8 cm, length = 10 cm), which was pre-equilibrated with a 10 mmMES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 200 g/liter glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 100 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing high TMABA-DH activity were pooled and loaded onto a red Sepharose CL-6B column (inner diameter = 0.8 cm, length = 7.5 cm), that was pre-equilibrated with a 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 200 g/liter glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 25 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 500 mm NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing TMABA-DH activity were pooled and dialyzed against a 10 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 200 g/liter glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm potassium phosphate. This dialysate was loaded onto an Econo-Pac CHT-II hydroxylapatite column (inner diameter =1 cm, length = 5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 250 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions were tested for TMABA-DH activity and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by silver staining. SDS-PAGE and silver staining were performed as described by Laemmli (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) and Rabilloudet al. (18.Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (19.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. 10 μg of the purified TMABA-DH was digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.05 μg of endoprotease Glu-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.01% SDS. Protein fragments were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, and a Multiphor II Nova Blot electrophoretic transfer unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to transfer proteins onto a polyvinylidene difluoride-sequencing membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described by the manufacturer of the transfer unit. Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed using a Procise 494 protein sequencer. The complete open reading frame (ORF) of TMABA-DH was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from rat liver cDNA using Advantage cDNA polymerase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the following primers: an EcoRI-tagged forward primer 5′-tatagaattc ATGAGCACTGGCACCTTCG-3′ and aSalI-tagged reverse primer 5′-tatagtcgacTTTTCAAAARGCWGAYTCCAC-3′. The degenerate nature of the second primer also allowed the amplification of the ALDH9 ORF from human liver cDNA using the same primer set. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned downstream of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible PTAC promoter into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the bacterial expression vector pMAL-C2X, to express the TMABA-DH and ALDH9 as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP). The ORFs were sequenced to exclude sequence errors introduced by the polymerase chain reaction, after which the constructs were transformed to the E. coli strain BL21. Transformed cells were grown on LB medium to an A 600 of 0.7, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce expression of the fusion protein. After 2 h, cells were pelleted and lysed in one-tenth of the culture volume in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 200 g/liter glycerol, and 1 mm DTT by sonicating 2 times for 15 s at 8 W. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. Fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant following the specifications of the manufacturer of the expression system (New England Biolabs) and stored at −80 °C in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 200 g/liter glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) and maximal velocity (V max) for γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde and several other aldehydes were determined for the purified rat liver enzyme and the purified recombinant fusion proteins using the assay described above. The concentration of γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde was determined with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as described by Ariga (20.Ariga N. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 43: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). γ-Aminobutyraldehyde was freshly prepared from 4-aminobutyraldehyde diethylacetal as described by Kurys et al. (21.Kurys G. Ambroziak W. Pietruszko R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its concentration was determined witho-aminobenzaldehyde as reported by Jakoby and Fredericks (22.Jakoby W.B. Fredericks J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2145-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the instability of γ-aminobutyraldehyde at alkaline pH, activity measurements with this compound as substrate were performed at pH 7.4 using a 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer. For the determination of the K m of NAD+and NADP+, γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde was used at a fixed concentration of 100 μm. In initial experiments, high TMABA-DH activity (∼3 nmol/min·mg) could be measured in crude rat liver homogenates. Subsequent measurement of TMABA-DH activity in subcellular fractions of rat liver showed that the activity was only present in the cytosolic fraction (results not shown). Therefore, rat liver cytosol was used as source of enzyme for the purification of TMABA-DH using liquid chromatography. An overview of the purification scheme is given in TableI. TMABA-DH activity was completely retained by all columns used and eluted as a single peak during all purification steps. Samples obtained after each purification step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (Fig.1). A single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa was observed after the last purification step. The purified enzyme was highly unstable, except when stored at −80 °C in the presence of 1 mm DTT and 200 g/liter glycerol. Even after several months of storage, no loss of activity could be measured.Table IPurification of TMABA-DH from rat liverPurification stepProteinSpecific activityActivityYieldPurificationmgnmol/min·mgnmol/min%-foldPost-nuclear supernatant17603.9686710020,000 × gsupernatant7515.64206611.4SP-Sepharose fast flow8.328823903574Red Sepharose CL-6B1.14835318123Hydroxylapatite CHT-II0.67724637198 Open table in a new tab Attempts to directly sequence the protein by Edman degradation failed, suggesting that the N terminus of TMABA-DH is blocked. Therefore, the purified enzyme was subjected to digestion with the endoprotease Glu-C to generate peptides with a free N terminus. Peptide fragments were separated on SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride-sequencing membrane, and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Two peptide fragments were N-terminally sequenced, which resulted in the following sequences: EXINNGKSIFEA and EARLDVDTS (where X denotes an amino acid that could not be identified unambiguously). When the Swiss-Prot data base was screened with these sequences, the only homology found was with the human ALDH9 (EC 1.2.1.19, Swiss-Prot P49189). Subsequent searches in the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base identified several rat, mouse, and human EST clones with high homology to the peptide sequences. The homologous human ESTs all corresponded to the ALDH9 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U34252) (23.Lin S.W. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Hsieh C.L. Yoshida A. Genomics. 1996; 34: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24.Kurys G. Shah P.C. Kikonygo A. Reed D. Ambroziak W. Pietruszko R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Based on the EST data, primers were selected to amplify the ORFs from rat and mouse liver cDNA. The rat and mouse amplicons both contained an ORF of 1485 base pairs, coding for a polypeptide of 494 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa (GenBank™ accession numbers AF170918 and AF170919, respectively). The translated rat and mouse ORFs both have 92% positional identity with the human ALDH9 protein. The rat and mouse proteins are also highly homologous and share 96% positional identity. The two peptides obtained by Edman degradation were found to overlap, resulting in the following sequence: EXINNGKSIFEARLDVDTS. This sequence is identical to a 19-amino acid stretch in the N-terminal region of the rat sequence (95–114), demonstrating that the rat cDNA encodes TMABA-DH. The entire coding sequence of the rat cDNA was cloned into the pMAL-C2X expression vector and expressed in E. colias a fusion protein with MBP. The fusion protein was purified from theE. coli lysate by affinity chromatography, and TMABA-DH activity was measured. The purified fusion protein exhibited high TMABA-DH activity, which confirmed that the cDNA encodes TMABA-DH. Human ALDH9 has high homology with the identified rat TMABA-DH and has been reported to dehydrogenate γ-aminobutyraldehyde and betaine aldehyde (21.Kurys G. Ambroziak W. Pietruszko R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Chern M.K. Pietruszko R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which are compounds with considerable structural resemblance to γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (Fig.2). Therefore, the ALDH9 ORF was cloned in the pMAL-C2X vector to express ALDH9 as an MBP fusion protein. Sequencing of the ALDH9 ORF revealed three additional nucleotides in a GC-rich stretch of the previously reported ALDH9 cDNA, altering the predicted amino acid sequence. This information can be accessed through the GenBank™ data base, accession number AF172093. The MBP-ALDH9 fusion protein was affinity-purified from E. coli lysate to determine whether ALDH9 was also active toward γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. The fusion protein exhibited high TMABA-DH activity, which indicates that ALDH9 is the human orthologue of rat TMABA-DH. To investigate if the purified rat liver TMABA-DH and the rat MBP-TMABA-DH could also handle the substrates reported for ALDH9 and to further characterize the substrate specificity of the three enzymes, their kinetic properties were determined. Table II shows the kinetic parameters of the purified rat liver TMABA-DH, rat MBP-TMABA-DH, and MBP-ALDH9 with NAD+, NADP+, γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde, γ-aminobutyraldehyde, betaine aldehyde, and a range of aliphatic aldehydes as substrates. TheK m and relative V max values of the purified MBP fusion proteins for the different substrates show a similar profile as the purified rat liver TMABA-DH. NAD+was by far the preferred oxidant for all substrates, although NADP+ could also be used. The three enzymes have the lowestK m for γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde in combination with a high V max value. As a consequence, the V max/K mratio is highest for γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde when compared with the other substrates. The presence of a free amino group in γ-aminobutyraldehyde instead of the trimethylated amino group in γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde results in considerably lower efficiency. Betaine aldehyde, the carbon backbone of which is two atoms shorter than γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde but that contains the trimethylated amino group, is readily oxidized to betaine as reflected in the high V max values. The three enzymes have a high K m for betaine aldehyde, however, which results in a substantially lower efficiency when compared with γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. For the aliphatic aldehydes in the C2-C8 range, the decrease in theK m values is accompanied by a steady increase ofV max, showing that the efficiency of the enzymes is higher when the chain length of the aliphatic aldehyde increases. The efficiency of the enzymes with the longer aldehydes, hexadecanal and octadecanal, is very low if not undetectable.Table IISubstrate specificity of purified TMABA-DH and heterologously expressed enzymesSubstrateRat liver TMABA-DHRat-MBP-TMABA-DHMBP-ALDH9K mV maxV max/K mK mV maxV max/K mK mV maxV max/K mμm%μm%μm%NAD+284968NADP+163042304695γ-Trimethylaminobutyraldehyde1.410071.402.610038.464.810020.83γ-Aminobutyraldehyde24200.8331341.1028200.71Betaine aldehyde1232261.841182502.121821290.71Acetaldehyde (C2)10270.07115160.14175200.11Propionaldehyde (C3)1680.5034210.6248110.23Butyraldehyde (C4)13151.1512393.2513161.23Pentanal (C5)10161.6011363.2710212.10Hexanal (C6)9182.008475.888212.63Heptanal (C7)7182.5746616.507202.86Octanal (C8)6284.677527.437294.14Hexadecanal (C16)8.820.23NDNDNDNDOctadecanal (C18)NDaND, not detectable.NDNDNDNDNDEnzyme assays were performed as described in “Experimental Procedures,” and the results are the means of three independent measurements.

To identify the enzymes of the carnitine biosynthetic pathway at the molecular level, we previously purified rat liver γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, the last enzyme in carnitine biosynthesis and used protein sequence data in combination with the EST data base to identify the corresponding human cDNA (15.Vaz F.M. van Gool S. Ofman R. Ijlst L. Wanders R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study the same approach was used to identify TMABA-DH, which mediates the penultimate step in carnitine biosynthesis. The enzyme was purified from rat liver to apparent homogeneity and used for peptide sequencing. The resulting peptide sequences were subsequently used to search the EST data base, and two ORFs were identified from rat and mouse encoding proteins with high homology to the previously reported human ALDH9. The following observations demonstrated that the identified rat cDNA truly encodes TMABA-DH. First, the peptide sequence obtained by sequencing of the purified rat TMABA-DH exactly matched a 19-amino acid stretch in the translated coding region of the rat cDNA. Second, the cDNA encodes a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 55 kDa, which is in accordance with the apparent molecular mass of the purified rat liver TMABA-DH. Third, heterologously expressed rat cDNA exhibited high TMABA-DH activity. Finally, the kinetic properties of the recombinant rat MBP fusion protein are highly similar to those of TMABA-DH purified from rat liver. Although we did not express the mouse ORF in E. coli, it has 96% positional identity with the rat TMABA-DH and, therefore, most likely represents the mouse orthologue of rat TMABA-DH. The rat TMABA-DH has high positional identity (92%) with human ALDH9. ALDH9 is a cytosolic NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase belonging to the human aldehyde dehydrogenase gene family (26.Yoshida A. Rzhetsky A. Hsu L.C. Chang C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). It has been extensively investigated because of its proposed function in the alternative synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (23.Lin S.W. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Hsieh C.L. Yoshida A. Genomics. 1996; 34: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27.Kikonyogo A. Pietruszko R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28.Ambroziak W. Kurys G. Pietruszko R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 100: 321-327Google Scholar, 29.Ambroziak W. Maslinski C. Agents Actions. 1988; 23: 311-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this pathway, diamine oxidase oxidatively deaminates putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) to γ-aminobutyraldehyde, which is subsequently oxidized to GABA by ALDH9. The majority of the GABA in rat adrenal gland is produced via this alternative pathway, whereas the GABA in brain is predominantly synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase (30.Caron P.C. Cote L.J. Kremzner L.T. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both the physiological importance of the conversion of putrescine to γ-aminobutyric acid and the function of GABA outside the central nervous system is not well understood and remains to be established. More recently, ALDH9 has also been implicated in the synthesis of betaine. Betaine can serve as a methyl donor in the biosynthesis of methionine and has also been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the osmolarity in the kidney during antidiuresis (31.Barak A.J. Beckenhauer H.C. Tuma D.J. Alcohol. 1996; 13: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32.Grunewald R.W. Eckstein A.

J. 1992; 282: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For the synthesis of betaine, choline is oxidized by choline dehydrogenase to betaine aldehyde, which is subsequently converted to betaine by ALDH9 (25.Chern M.K. Pietruszko R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34.Izaguirre G. Kikonyogo A. Pietruszko R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118: 59-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In human tissues, betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity is predominantly found in liver, adrenal gland, and kidney. Northern blot analysis has shown the presence of the ALDH9 mRNA in liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, pancreas, lung, and placenta (23.Lin S.W. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Hsieh C.L. Yoshida A. Genomics. 1996; 34: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27.Kikonyogo A. Pietruszko R. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,34.Izaguirre G. Kikonyogo A. Pietruszko R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118: 59-64Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The high homology with rat TMABA-DH and the structural resemblance of the substrates of ALDH9 with γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde prompted us to study whether human ALDH9 is in fact the human TMABA-DH. The finding that the recombinant human MBP-ALDH9 fusion protein exhibits high TMABA-DH activity suggests that human ALDH9 is, indeed, the human TMABA-DH. Since ALDH9 has been reported to oxidize betaine aldehyde and γ-aminobutyraldehyde, the kinetic properties of the two recombinant MBP fusion proteins and the purified rat liver TMABA-DH were also determined for these and other substrates. Like the ALDH9 MBP fusion protein, both rat liver TMABA-DH and the rat TMABA-DH MBP fusion protein oxidized γ-aminobutyraldehyde and betaine aldehyde. However, when considering both affinity and maximal velocity, γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde is clearly the best substrate for all three enzymes. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of cod liver ALDH9 has been determined at a 2.1-Å resolution by x-ray crystallography (35.Johansson K. El-Ahmad M. Ramaswamy S. Hjelmqvist L. Jornvall H. Eklund H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This protein has 70% positional identity with the human ALDH9 and is considered to be the cod orthologue of human ALDH9. The structural information revealed that the active site of cod ALDH9 is capable of handling larger aldehydes than betaine aldehyde, which is in accordance with our results, which reveal that the three forms of ALDH9 studied in this paper show the highestV max/K m ratio for straight-chain aldehydes with a length of 7/8 carbon atoms. The preference for longer aldehydes also explains the relatively lowK m values for γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde and γ-aminobutyraldehyde opposed to the high K m value for betaine aldehyde. The high V max value of the enzymes for betaine aldehyde is difficult to explain on the basis of the data presented here. Additional research is needed to understand this phenomenon. Further investigation of the active site of cod ALDH9 showed that there is no negatively charged residue in the substrate pocket that interacts with the trimethylated amino group of betaine aldehyde. Instead, a hydrophobic interaction has been proposed between a tryptophan residue and the trimethylamino group of betaine aldehyde (35.Johansson K. El-Ahmad M. Ramaswamy S. Hjelmqvist L. Jornvall H. Eklund H. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2106-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). If the nature of the interaction with the amino group of the substrate is hydrophobic instead of electrostatic, the reason for a higher K mvalue for γ-aminobutyraldehyde than for γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde could be that the positively charged amino group in γ-aminobutyraldehyde is shielded by three methyl groups in γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde. The high activity of the heterologously expressed human ALDH9 with γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde and the highly similar substrate specificity of ALDH9 and rat TMABA-DH strongly suggest that the human ALDH9 is the human TMABA-DH. This is supported by the presence of high betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in human kidney and liver and the ALDH9 mRNA in tissues that contain high TMABA-DH activity (10.Rebouche C.J. Engel A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,23.Lin S.W. Chen J.C. Hsu L.C. Hsieh C.L. Yoshida A.

Although our data do not exclude an additional function of ALDH9 in GABA and/or betaine synthesis, the results presented in this paper indicate that ALDH9 is the predominant, if not exclusive aldehyde dehydrogenase that functions in carnitine biosynthesis.

When compared with normal adult rat liver, the relative cellular content of the mitochondrial β-F1-ATPase and glutamate dehydrogenase, as well as of mitochondrial DNA, was severely reduced in both cell lines. A paradoxical increase in the cellular abundance of β-F1-ATPase mRNA was observed in cancer cells. Run-on transcription assays and the estimation of mRNA half-lives revealed that the increased abundance of β-F1-ATPase mRNA results from the stabilization of the transcript in cancer. In vitro translation assays revealed a specific inhibition of the synthesis of the β-precursor when translation reactions were carried out in the presence of extracts derived from cancer cells. The inhibitory effect was recapitulated using an RNA chimera that contained the 3′-untranslated region of β-F1-ATPase mRNA.

Regulation of translation of the β-F1-ATPase gene in the liver involves two mechanisms that use the 3′-UTR of the transcript as target element (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell.

The 3′-UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA is a translational enhancer sequence required for mRNA translation and, in addition, provides the cis-acting sequence where developmentally regulated inhibitory proteins bind for controlling the expression of the mRNA (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, we suggested that the abnormal biogenesis of mitochondria in hepatomas might represent a reversion to a fetal program of expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes (5.Cuezva J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Ricart J. Lopez de Heredia M. Di Liegro C.M. Izquierdo J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This would imply the activation of the mechanisms controlling the stability and translation of essential mRNAs required for organelle biogenesis in hepatomas. In the present investigation we have studied the feasibility of this hypothesis. To this end, we have analyzed the mitochondrial phenotype of the rat FAO and AS30D hepatoma cell lines. Both hepatomas have a reduced mitochondrial content when compared with the adult rat liver. The results indicate the operation in cancer cells of the same post-transcriptional mechanisms that control the expression of the β-F1-ATPase gene in the liver during fetal development. Remarkably, hepatoma extracts also contained an increased activity of translation-inhibitory proteins that bind the 3′-UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA. The results provide the first mechanistic indications that explain the paradoxical abnormal biogenesis of mitochondria in cancer cells. It is suggested that the reduction in the mitochondrial content of cancer cells derives from the dilution of mitochondrial constituents during cellular proliferation as a result of the translational arrest experienced by essential mitochondrial components required for the biogenesis of mitochondria.DISCUSSIONWe recently hypothesized that the paradoxical reduction in the complement of mitochondria in cancer and transformed cells might result from a reversion to a fetal program of expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes in these cells (5.Cuezva J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Ricart J. Lopez de Heredia M. Di Liegro C.M. Izquierdo J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the present investigation we demonstrate that two hepatomas derived from rat liver have a severe reduction in their mitochondrial complement when compared with normal adult rat liver. The down-regulation of the mitochondrial cellular complement of the hepatomas occurs in a paradoxical situation of an increased abundance of the nuclear transcript encoding the mitochondrial β-F1-ATPase protein. A similar finding has been observed in human hepatocarcinomas when compared with normal human liver. 3M. López de Heredia, C. Ugalde, M. Chamorro, and J. M. Cuezva, manuscript in preparation. These observations are similar to that previously described in the fetal rat liver (15.Luis A.M. Izquierdo J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Salinas M. Santaren J.F. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,16.Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. Ostronoff L.K. Egea G. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10342-10350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in different cell lines in culture that have been transformed with viral and cellular oncogenes (9.Faure Vigny H. Heddi A. Giraud S. Chautard D. Stepien G. Mol. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 16: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12.Torroni A. Stepien G. Hodge J.A. Wallace D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20589-20593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings thus suggest the existence of common determinants between development and carcinogenesis for the control of the biogenesis of mitochondria.The findings indicate that the increased abundance of β-F1-ATPase mRNA in hepatomas is not the result of an increase in the transcription rate of the gene but is rather mediated by an increase in the mRNA half-life. A similar observation explains the augmented cellular representation of the transcript in the fetal liver (16.Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. Ostronoff L.K. Egea G. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10342-10350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In hepatomas, a specific translation repression mechanism operates for the expression of β-F1-ATPase mRNA that has the 3′-UTR of the transcript as cis-acting element of regulation. These findings also agree with the mechanism controlling the expression of the β-F1-ATPase gene during fetal liver development (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, hepatoma extracts have an increased activity of 3′βFBPs. This set of 3′βFBPs have quite the same molecular mass and binding requirements on the 3′-UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA as the set that inhibits the translation of β-F1-ATPase mRNA in the fetal liver (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, the results presented strongly argue that the expression of the β-F1-ATPase gene in hepatomas, and perhaps in other cancer cells, results from a reversion in cancer to the program of expression of the gene that operates in the liver during intrauterine development (5.Cuezva J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Ricart J. Lopez de Heredia M. Di Liegro C.M. Izquierdo J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the observed reversion could also be applied to the expression of other genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and, therefore, in the biogenesis of mitochondria.The nuclear-encoded β-F1-ATPase mRNA has been recently shown to be localized in defined cytoplasmic structures of the hepatocyte that appear to be responsible for controlling the cytoplasmic metabolism of the transcript (31.Egea G. Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. San Martin C. Cuezva J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36.Ricart J. Egea G. Izquierdo J.M. San Martin C. Cuezva J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as well as the delivery of the encoded precursor protein to mitochondria (36.Ricart J. Egea G. Izquierdo J.M. San Martin C. Cuezva J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 37.Lithgow T. Cuezva J.M. Silver P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 110-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Most describedcis-acting sequences involved in the localization and regulation of mRNA turnover are placed within the 3′-UTR of the mRNAs (38.Curtis D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 39.Decker C.J. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 40.Hentze M.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41.Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA is a short 150-base pair AU-rich sequence that also contains the determinants for mRNA translation (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the short 3′-UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA, we suggest the existence of a certain degree of overlap in the function of cis-acting sequences involved in controlling its metabolism (localization, stability, and translation). In fact, the findings in hepatomas provide an additional example, to those previously documented during development (15.Luis A.M. Izquierdo J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Salinas M. Santaren J.F. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. Ostronoff L.K. Egea G. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10342-10350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which changes in the stability and in the cellular representation of the transcript are coupled to changes in its translation rate. In this regard, we suggest that proteins binding the 3′-UTR of β-F1-ATPase mRNA participate in defining both activities of the cytoplasmic fate of the transcript. In other words, the translation masking of the mRNA affects its stability, and concomitantly its cellular representation, because both mechanisms may illustrate the same cellular process that has, as effector molecules, the regulated proteins that bind the 3′-UTR of the transcript (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Remarkably, the findings in hepatomas also provide an additional example in which the stability of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts encoded in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes varied in parallel (16.Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. Ostronoff L.K. Egea G. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10342-10350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17.Ostronoff L.K. Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings thus reinforce the idea that there should be a common mechanism for controlling mRNA decay rates in both genetic compartments of the cell, a mechanism that may be different from that described in HepG2 cells (42.Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z.M. Preiss T. Lightowlers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27322-27328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the observation that the activation of cytoplasmic translation controls the expression of mitochondrially encoded mRNAs (18.Ostronoff L.K. Izquierdo J.M. Enriquez J.A. Montoya J. Cuezva J.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) during organelle differentiation (5.Cuezva J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Ricart J. Lopez de Heredia M. Di Liegro C.M. Izquierdo J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14.Valcarce C. Navarrete R.M. Encabo P. Loeches E. Satrustegui J. Cuezva J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7767-7775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that cytoplasmic translation also controls the expression of mitochondrially encoded mRNAs in cancer cells.The operation of mechanisms of stabilization of oxidative phosphorylation mRNAs and subsequent translation masking for the transcripts generated in both genetic units could most likely be responsible for the progressive decline in the mitochondrial complement of cancer cells as a result of cellular proliferation. The reduction of mtDNA in cancer cells could result directly from the dilution of mitochondrial constituents during cellular proliferation. However, it is also possible that essential components of the replication machinery of mtDNA are also subjected to translational regulation. In this regard, it is interesting to note that both DNA polymerase γ (43.Annex B.H. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 44.Schultz R.A. Swoap S.J. McDaniel L.D. Zhang B. Koon E.C. Garry D.J. Li K. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3447-3451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (45.Larsson N.G. Wang J. Wilhelmsson H. Oldfors A. Rustin P. Lewandoski M. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar) seem to be subjected also to post-transcriptional regulation.In agreement with our previous proposal for the control of β-F1-ATPase mRNA translation in the fetal rat liver (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suggest that the increased activity of 3′βFBPs in hepatomas could be responsible for the inefficient translation of β-F1-ATPase mRNA in cancer. Binding of the repressor proteins to the most 3′-sequence of the 3′-UTR may sterically hamper the 5′-3′ communication required for an efficient reinitiating of β-F1-ATPase mRNA translation (19.Izquierdo J.M. Cuezva J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, the proteins that inhibit β-F1-ATPase mRNA translation in the fetal liver may be the same as those present in FAO hepatomas (Fig. 8, B and D). In fact, there is compelling evidence in the literature that illustrates a switch from the adult-type to fetal-type isozyme patterns in hepatic tumors (46.Weinhouse S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1983; 21: 369-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed, it is possible that the 3′βFBP observed in AS30D hepatomas (Fig. 8, B and D) could result from covalent modification of one of those present in fetal liver and the FAO hepatoma. The phosphorylation of 3′-UTR binding proteins has been described to control the rate of translation of certain mRNAs (47.Kwon Y.K. Hecht N.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6547-6557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Malter J.S. Hong Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3167-3171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Amara F.M. Sun J. Wright J.A. J.

Fed. Proc. 1973; 32: 2162-2167PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Pedersen P.L. Prog. Exp. Tumor Res. 1978; 22: 190-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Cuezva J.M. Ostronoff L.K. Ricart J. Lopez de Heredia M.

It is reasonable to assume that these analogies arise from common genetic determinants between developing liver and carcinogenesis.

Hypoxia also promotes an up-regulation in the cellular representation of certain mRNAs by controlling the stability of the transcripts (55.Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol.

It is possible that the control of the stability and subsequent up-regulation of β-F1-ATPase mRNA levels observed in the fetal rat liver (16.Izquierdo J.M. Ricart J. Ostronoff L.K. Egea G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10342-10350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in the hepatomas (this study) could share the same mechanism and signaling molecule.Finally, recent findings indicated the necessity of a functional H+-ATP synthase (62.Matsuyama S. Xu Q. Velours J. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 327-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) to execute apoptosis. Apoptosis is a genetically encoded program of cell death that is indispensable for normal development of the organism (63.Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2393) Google Scholar) and that can also contribute to lessen the progression of certain disorders (64.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6172) Google Scholar, 65.Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a central role as executioners of apoptotic cell death (66.Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar, 67.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, a frequent characteristic of cancer cells is their resistance to apoptotic stimulus (65.Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1999; 11: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 68.Decaudin D. Marzo I. Brenner C. Kroemer G. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 141-152PubMed Google Scholar). In line with these findings, it appears that cancer cells have developed alternative mechanisms to control the cellular content of this essential mitochondrial protein. In fact, it has been described that the β-F1-ATPase protein has an increased turnover in the Zadjela hepatoma (6.Luciakova K. Kuzela S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Whereas this finding illustrates a mechanism of post-translational regulation for controlling the cellular content of the protein, our findings illustrate a mechanism that is regulated at the level of translation. The final result of the operation of any of these mechanisms is the reduction in the content and/or activity of mitochondria in cancer cells. Recent findings indicated that hypoxia provides a physiologically selective pressure for the clonal expansion of cancer cells that have acquired mutations in genes that are involved in the control of apoptosis (69.Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Due to the pivotal role played by mitochondria as sensors and executioners of apoptosis (66.Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche Rigon M. Annu. Rev.

Signaling interactions between ANP and the G protein-coupled growth factor receptor ligand, endothelin-3 (ET-3), regulate astrocyte proliferation at a very proximal but undefined point. Here, we find that ANP inhibits the ability of ET-3 to activate Gαq and Gαi in these cells. ANP stimulated the translocation of endogenous regulators of G protein-signaling (RGS) proteins 3 and 4 from the cytosol to the cell membrane, and enhanced their association with Gαq and Gαi. ANP effects were significantly blocked by HS-142–1, an inhibitor of guanylate cyclase activation, or by ET-3.

A novel cross-talk between PKG and RGS proteins is stimulated by ANP and leads to the increased translocation and association of RGS proteins with Gα.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase then increases the transcription of Egr-1, which in turn binds to the promoter and stimulates the transcription of the astrocyte growth factor basic fibroblast growth factor gene (6.Biesiada E. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18576-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This sequence leads to glial cell cycle progression (7.Pedram A. Razandi M. Hu R.-M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13966-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and astrocyte division. Equally important, the anti-mitogen, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) inhibits many steps, which are stimulated by ET-3. The interactions between these two peptides probably begin at an undefined but proximal level of signal transduction (8.Prins B.A. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14156-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), perhaps at the level of G protein activation. G protein activation occurs rapidly after ligand binding to GPCRs. Ligation results in the dissociation of GDP from the G protein heterotrimeric complex, whereupon GTP binds to the Gα subunit in its active state, and the βγ subunit complex dissociates; either Gα or Gβγ subunits can stimulate downstream effectors (reviewed in Ref. 9.Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Gα subunits have an intrinsic GTPase activity that hydrolyzes GTP to GDP. Gα·GDP has a higher affinity for Gβγ and their association terminates Gβγ signaling (reviewed in Ref.10.Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The inhibition of G protein activity can arise from several known mechanisms. Increased activity of protein kinases A, C, or G protein receptor kinases results in the phosphorylation/desensitization of GPCR and down-regulation of G protein activity (11.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 12.Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 409-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Increased GαGTPase activity can be stimulated by effectors, such as phosphodiesterase or phospholipase C (13.Arshavsky V.Y. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 14.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 411-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Recently, regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins have been isolated and shown to stimulate GTPase activity, i.e. behave as GTPase-activating proteins for Gα subunits (15.DeVries L.

Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). There are 20 RGS proteins currently identified in eukaryotic cells (20.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and they show some specificity of function; different RGS proteins preferentially bind to different Gα subunits (20.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 21.Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Much of our knowledge of the function of these proteins comes from reconstituted systems and the modulation and roles of endogenous RGS in primary, nontransfected cells is not as well understood. Here we report that ANP inhibits the ET activation of Gαq and Gαi in primary cultures of astrocytes. This action of ANP is potentially mediated in part through alterations of RGS protein localization and function and occurs via the activation of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). This represents a novel cross-communication between signal transduction systems in these cells. Primary cultures of fetal rat diencephalic astrocytes were prepared and maintained as described previously (22.Levin E.R. Frank H.J.L. Gelfand R. Loughlin S. Kaplan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10019-10024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were typically used in their second passage. Antibodies and substrate for kinase activity were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Growth factors were from Calbiochem or Sigma. LipofectAMINE was from Life Technologies, Inc. RGS-specific antiserum was raised in a rabbit against recombinant RGS protein and recognizes a 75-kDa protein that co-migrates with recombinant andin vitro translated RGS3. The RGS4 antibody is also a polyclonal, rabbit antibody raised against the N terminus of RGS4 coupled to limpet hemocyanin. The antibody recognizes a 30-kDa protein that co-migrates with recombinant RGS4, and was kindly provided by Dr. Kirk Druey, NIH. Dishes (100 mm) of cultured astrocytes were incubated with 10 nm ET-3 in the presence or absence of 10 nm ANP or C-ANP4–23 for 2 min. Cell membranes from astrocytes were then prepared and analyzed for lack of cytosol (23.Razandi M. Pedram A. Rubin T. Levin E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1342-H1349PubMed Google Scholar), and G protein activation brought on by the original whole cell incubation conditions was determined as described previously (24.Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Membrane aliquots were resuspended and incubated with 30 nm[35S]GTPγS (NEN Life Science Products) for 5 min at 30 °C. Incubations were terminated, and cell lysates were added to 2 μl of nonimmune serum preincubated with a 10% suspension of pansorbin cells (Calbiochem). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Gq or Gi α subunit antibody (Calbiochem) and preincubated with protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitants were boiled with SDS, and GTPγS binding was quantified by scintillation counting; each condition was prepared in duplicate, and the data were combined from three separate experiments. Cultured astrocytes were synchronized and then labeled with [35S]methionine as described previously (7.Pedram A. Razandi M. Hu R.-M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13966-13972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with 10 nm ANP or C-ANP, or 1 μm 8-Br-cGMP, alone or in combination with 10 nm ET-3, 0.5 μmKT-5823, or 50 nm KT5720 for 2 min. The cells were then lysed, and the membrane fraction was prepared. Equal total cell membrane protein fractions from each experimental condition were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to RGS3 and RGS4 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In additional studies, the astrocytes were transfected with a constituitively active catalytic subunit of PKG I (25.Dey N.B. Boerth N.J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Chang P.L. Prince C.W. Lincoln T.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereby 5 μg of the plasmid cDNA was used for transfecting 100-mm culture dishes of astrocytes. After a 24-h recovery, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, some in the presence of KT5823 or ET-3, and RGS translocation to the membrane was determined. Whole astrocytes were first incubated for 2 min at 37 °C with ANP, ET-3, or both peptides followed by membrane isolation from each experimental condition. Antibodies to RGS3 or -4 (diluted 1:50) were complexed to protein A-Sepharose beads, and 100 μl of membranes from discrete incubation conditions were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. After microcentrifuging, pellets were solubilized with gel-loading buffer, boiled, and then separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The separated protein was transferred to a membrane and blotted with antibodies to Gαq and Gαi, using the ECL Western blot kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GTPase activity measurements in rat astrocyte cell membranes were carried out as described (26.Shenker A. Goldsmith P. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9309-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, whole astrocytes were incubated without (medium alone) or with ET-3, ANP, or both peptides, for 2 min, to affect RGS translocation, and then membranes from each condition were isolated. Some cells were also transfected to express the active catalytic subunit of the PKG I, and these membranes were also isolated in parallel with the other conditions. Equal amounts of cell membrane proteins from each incubation condition were then exposed to the same experimental treatment under which the membranes were isolated, for a time course of GTPase. The PKG membranes were exposed only to medium for the time course assay. The final reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 0.4 uCi of [γ-32P]GTP (1.5–2 × 106 dpm) (NEN Life Science Products) and were carried out over 30 min at 25 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 750 μl of cold 5% (w/v) activated charcoal in 20 mm of phosphoric acid. Tubes were microfuged at 6000 × g at 4 °C, and the released32P in 400 μl of each supernatant was counted in scintillation fluid. GTPase activities were corrected for nonspecific hydrolytic release of 32P in the absence of membrane (very low). Astrocytes were labeled with32Pi for 2 h and incubated with ANP ± ET or KT5823 for 2 min. The cells were lysed, and after protein normalization, RGS3 and -4 were immunoprecipitated from the whole cell and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In separate experiments, astrocytes were transfected with the expression vector for the active catalytic subunit of PKG I. The cells were recovered and similarly labeled with 32Pi and then incubated in the absence or presence of KT5823 or ET-3. RGS3 and -4 phosphorylation was similarly determined. Our previous studies led us to postulate that ET-ANP interactions occur proximally. We now find that in membranes from primary cultures of nonmanipulated astrocytes, ET-3 directly stimulates an increase in Gαqand Gαi activity, determined by enhanced binding of GTPγS to these subunits (Fig. 1). We also found that the antigrowth factor, ANP, significantly inhibits ET-3-stimulation of Gαq or Gαi activity by 51 and 56%, respectively. Furthermore, C-ANP 4–23, a specific ligand for the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPCR) (27.Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), was 50–65% as potent as ANP in inhibiting Gαq and Gαi protein activation by ET-3. ANP binds both guanylate cyclase (GC) receptors and NPCR with equal avidity and hence cannot be used alone to determine which receptor mediates the actions of ANP. These results suggest that both the guanylate cyclase and NPCR receptors contribute to G protein inactivation. Because the NPCR ligand is not as potent as ANP in suppressing G protein inactivation, the two receptor subtypes may utilize different mechanisms to accomplish this. As a potential mechanism, we determined whether ANP could stimulate the translocation of RGS to the cell membrane. RGS proteins are believed to down-regulate G protein activation by increasing the GTPase activity of Gα and Gαq (20.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and for certain RGS proteins this may require the RGS protein to translocate to the cell membrane (28.Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Some RGS proteins may be constituitively associated with the membrane, whereas others are translocated upon the appropriate stimuli. By immunoblot, the astrocytes produce RGS3 and RGS4 proteins (data not shown). We found that ANP significantly stimulated the translocation of both RGS3 and RGS4 to the cell membrane (protein at the membrane (above) and cytosol (below) is shown in Fig.2); the amount of RGS at the membrane increased, whereas the amount of RGS in the cytoplasm decreased. If the membrane to cytoplasm RGS density ratio was arbitrarily designated as 1 in the absence of ANP, this peptide increased the ratio to approximately 3 for each RGS protein. Interestingly, ET-3 blocked the ability of ANP to stimulate RGS translocation (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 4 versus 6). This suggests that ligation of GPCR by ET-3 inhibits a mechanism that could lead to a more rapid or stronger inactivation of G proteins (also see below). In contrast to Fig. 1, only ANP but not C-ANP 4–23 stimulated RGS translocation (lanes 3 versus 4). The translocation of RGS is directly attributed to ANP activation of the GC-A receptor (29.Singh S. Lowe D.G. Thorpe D.S. Rodriguez H. Kuang W.J. Dangott L.J. Chinkers M. Goeddel D.V. Garbers D.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), because only ANP and not C-ANP 4–23 caused this effect. Further, these actions of ANP were blocked by HS-142–1 (lanes 7 versus 4), a specific inhibitor of natriuretic peptide receptor guanylate cyclase activation (30.Matsuda Y. Morishita Y. Cardiovasc. Drugs Rev. 1993; 11: 45-49Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We then found that ANP significantly stimulated in vivo the increased association of RGS 3 with Gαq (Fig.3 A) and Gαi(Fig. 3 B). The natriuretic peptide also stimulated the association of RGS4 with both G protein subunits (Fig. 3, Cand D). These effects were significantly reversed by HS-142–1, supporting the generation of cGMP as effector. Again, ET-3 blocked the association of the RGS with the two Gα subunits, and C-ANP 4–23 had no effect. These data support the idea that increasing association of RGS with Gα contributes to the ANP inhibition of G protein activation. Increasing translocation and association of RGS with Gαq and Gαi is predicted to lead to an increased GTPase activity and down-regulation of G protein activity, based upon results from reconstituted systems (15.DeVries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16.Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 17.Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 18.Koelle M.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19.Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Whole astrocytes were incubated without or with ANP, ET, or both peptides for 2 min, and membranes were prepared from cells subjected to each condition. In parallel, membranes were made from cells that expressed an active catalytic subunit of PKG. The membranes from a given condition were subsequently re-exposed to that condition (medium alone (control) or ANP, ET, or both peptides). Membranes from the catalytic subunit PKG-derived cells were exposed to medium alone, and a time course of GTPase activity was then carried out in all membranes. As seen in Fig. 4, membranes from cells incubated with ANP alone responded to subsequent ANP exposure with a significant increased GTPase compared with control membranes exposed to medium alone; this was seen as early as 1–2 min after initiating the GTPase reaction. Membranes from cells expressing active PKG exhibited comparably stimulated GTPase activity when exposed to medium alone. This is consistent with the ability of ANP or catalytic PKG to cause RGS translocation to the membrane. ET-3, as might be expected, potently stimulated a near 4-fold increase in GTPase activity, which peaked at 5 min. When membranes from astrocytes that were exposed to ANP + ET-3 were subsequently co-exposed to ANP and ET-3, there was a marked acceleration of maximum GTPase activity in this setting, compared with membranes/treatment with ET-3 alone. Maximal activity of GTPase was now seen at 2 min. This novel action of ANP would result in the rapid down-regulation of G protein activation and subsequent downstream signaling; the latter is known to occur in response to ANP (31.Hirata M. Kohse K.P. Chang C-H. Ikebe T. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1268-1273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, because we know that ET prevents ANP or PKG-stimulated RGS translocation at this time (Fig. 2), it is likely that there are two separate and important effects of ANP. The ability of ANP to shift the kinetics of GTPase activity in the setting of ET-3 is not because of increased translocation of RGS but could involve multiple complex mechanisms of ET and ANP action. A second action is seen in response to ANP alone or from the expression of PKG. The stimulation of GTPase above control shown in these two situations may result from the effects of the translocated RGS. To support the latter notion, we also carried out a GTPase time course study in astrocyte membranes from cells that were never exposed to either peptide. Here, subsequent incubation of the naı̈ve membranes with ANP alone did not increase GTPase activity, compared with medium-incubated naı̈ve membranes (data not shown). This indicates that the previous action of ANP alone could have been because of the stimulation of RGS translocation to the membrane. Importantly, the action of ANP to accelerate GTPase in the setting of co-incubation with ET-3 was also seen in the membranes from the naı̈ve cells. This supports the idea that this novel action of ANP is unrelated to the translocation of RGS. We postulated that the ANP effects shown occur when increased cGMP generated from GC-A activation stimulates PKG (reviewed in Ref. 32.Lincoln T.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 479-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As one effector of cGMP, PKG often exists in two forms (Types I and II) (33.Hofmann F. Dostmann W. Keilbach A. Landgraf W. Ruth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 34.Lincoln T.M. Cornwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). PKG-I is produced as two isoforms and has been identified both in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell membrane (35.MacMillan-Crow L.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Lincoln T.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Supporting the role of this kinase, KT5823, at a concentration (0.5 μm) that is known to specifically inhibit PKG activity (36.Grider J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G334-G340PubMed Google Scholar), prevented the ANP-induced translocation of both RGS3 (Fig.5 A) and RGS4 (Fig.5 B). In contrast, KT5720, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase A (37.Gadbois D.M. Crissman H.A. Tobey R.A. Bradbury E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8626-8630Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), had no effect on these actions of ANP. We subsequently used a concentration of KT5720 equivalent to the concentration of KT5823, and there was no reversal of the ANP effect (data not shown). Although protein kinase A is a known target for cGMP in some cells (38.Cornwell T.L. Arnold E. Boerth N.J. Lincoln T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1405-C1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it apparently is not important for ANP-induced translocation of RGS proteins in the astrocyte. We also transfected the astrocytes with a constituitively active catalytic subunit of PKG I. The increased PKG activity stimulated the translocation of RGS3 and RGS4 to the cell membrane, which was blocked by KT5823 (Fig. 5 C). In addition, 8-Br-cGMP comparably stimulated RGS3 and -4 translocation from the cytosol to the membrane compared with PKG (Fig. 5 D). In both instances, ET-3 substantially prevented these actions, indicating several levels of regulation by this peptide. These results demonstrate a novel cross-talk between the two signal transduction systems and considering all the results, indicate that G protein activation can be down-regulated by PKG, at least in part through effects on RGS proteins. We speculated that the ability of PKG to cause the translocation of RGS proteins was related to the ability of this kinase to stimulate the phosphorylation of RGS. To begin to address this, we showed that ANP promoted the increased phosphorylation of RGS in the astrocyte and that this was preventedin vivo by KT5823 (Fig.6 A). Consistently, ET blocked the phosphorylation of RGS in response to ANP. To further support the role of PKG, we examined RGS phosphorylation in astrocytes expressing the active catalytic subunit of PKG I in the absence of ANP. This kinase clearly resulted in the phosphorylation of RGS3 and -4, partially reversed by KT5823 and ET (Fig. 6 B). Because translocation of RGS occurs in a cGMP/PKG-dependent fashion, these additional findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphorylation and translocation of RGS occur in response to PKG and are linked. The inhibition of growth factor-induced signaling is an important mechanism by which antigrowth factors limit cell proliferation. This interaction could occur proximally or distally (39.Sugimoto T. Haneda M. Togawa M. Isono M. Shikano T. Araki S. Nakagawa T. Kashiwagi A. Guan K.L. Kikkawa R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 544-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in signal transduction pathways. We now show that the anti-mitogen, ANP, acts very proximally to inhibit ET-3-induced Gαq and Gαi activation. How does ANP modulate G protein activity? We found that there are several mechanisms potentially involved mediated by either the NPCR or the GC-A receptor. One mechanism likely involves the novel ability of ANP to stimulate the translocation of RGS3 and RGS4 to the cell membrane. It had been previously postulated that membrane translocation is necessary for the ability of RGS to inactivate G proteins (28.Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J. Gerfen C.R. Scheschonka A. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18405-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The increased ANP-induced translocation of RGS proteins shown here resulted in their association with Gαq and Gαi. Translocation and association of RGS3 and -4 with Gα subunits could lead to augmented GTPase activity, based upon many studies that show enhanced GTPase activation results from the interaction of expressed RGS proteins with Gα subunits (15.DeVries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 16.Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H.

Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In fact, we have found that ANP (or catalytically active PKG) can stimulate membrane GTPase activity. Both RGS4 and RGS3 are known inactivators of Gqand Gi (16.Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 40.Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and therefore may contribute to the inhibitory actions of ANP on signal transduction in the astrocyte. This may in turn contribute to the quiescent basal state of the astrocyte or limit activation of proliferation by growth factors (8.Prins B.A. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Daniels M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14156-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, it is also possible that other RGS proteins may contribute. Because RGS4 is known to inhibit Gq-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (16.Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 41.Yan Y. Chi P.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11924-11927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), regulation of this protein is particularly attractive to explain some of he antiproliferative actions of ANP in our model. The ability of ANP to cause the translocation of RGS proteins to the membrane occurs as the result of cGMP generation, because HS-142–1 reversed these effects of the natriuretic peptide. The cGMP second messenger can activate several effectors, but the cross-talk between signal transduction systems demonstrated here largely results from the activation of PKG. Our finding that a specific inhibitor of PKG reversed the actions of ANP on RGS supported this. Furthermore, expressing an active catalytic subunit of PKG in the absence of ANP stimulated RGS translocation to the cell membrane, as did 8-Br-cGMP. We found that inhibition of protein kinase A did not alter the actions of ANP. How does PKG modulate RGS function? RGS3 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vitro, 2A. Scheschonka and J. Kehrl, submitted for publication. and it is speculated that this might be involved in the translocation of RGS to the membrane (28.Druey K.M. Sullivan B.M. Brown D. Fischer E.R. Watson N. Blumer K.J.

We also know that RGS3 is phosphorylated in vivo by an undetermined kinase, based upon 32P cell-labeling studies.2 PKG may be such a kinase, because we show here in vivo that ANP can stimulate the phosphorylation of RGS3 and -4 reversed by the PKG inhibitor KT5823. Furthermore, an active PKG expressed in the absence of ANP, also caused the phosphorylation of RGS. Several target substrate sequences for PKG (RKX(S/T), where X is any amino acid) are found within RGS3 and RGS4, and we have recently found that PKG can directly phosphorylate both these proteins in vitro. 3A. Pedram, M. Razandi, and E. R. Levin, unpublished observations. In cells overexpressing RGS3, it has been recently shown that ET-1 can stimulate the translocation of this protein to the membrane (42.Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could provide a mechanism by which ET eventually restores the G protein inactive state and is consistent with our data, which indicates that ET activates peak GTPase activity at 5 min. Through hastening the activation and subsequent decay of GαGTPase activity, ANP inhibits G protein stimulation and may also contribute to resetting the receptor-G protein interaction at a quiescent level, awaiting the next stimulation by ET. It is likely that ANP accelerates GTPase activity in the setting of ET-3, by a mechanism apart from RGS translocation. This is because ET-3 prevented the ANP, cGMP, or PKG-induced translocation of RGS at 2 min. The exact mechanism of interaction is probably very complex. However, our novel observation that ANP accelerates GTPase activity in this setting is likely to be important in explaining the down-regulation of G protein-activated signal transduction. As additional mechanisms, G protein activation can be negatively modulated by cGMP and/or PKG through the phosphorylation of GPCR or Gi via PKG (43.Wang G.R. Zhu Y. Halushka P.V. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 44.Pfeifer A. Nurnberg B. Kamm S. Uhdel M. Schultz G. Ruth P. Hofman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9052-9059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and may contribute to the overall effects of ANP. In turn, growth factors can down-regulate cGMP production induced by natriuretic peptides (45.Chrisman T.D. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4293-4299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and this probably underlies the antagonism by ET of ANP actions on RGS shown here. Interestingly, our results indicate that ET-3 also blocks the ability of cGMP to stimulate RGS translocation, and the ability of active PKG to stimulate RGS translocation or phosphorylation. Thus, ET-3 seems to be capable of inhibiting several steps in the ANP-induced signal transduction pathway. These results support our additional proposal that down-regulation of the ANP-restraining mechanism might be necessary for full G protein activation by GPCR ligands. Acceleration of GTPase activity and inhibition of G protein activation by ANP could be important for the modulation of vascular smooth muscle vasomotor tone. In vascular smooth muscle and related cells, ET rapidly stimulates whereas ANP inhibits calcium flux and other downstream signaling (46.Suzuki E. Hirata Y. Matsuoka H. Sugimoto T. Hayakawa H. Shin W.S. Toyooka T. Sugimoto T. J. Hyperten. 1991; 9: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,47.Tei M. Horie M. Makita T. Suzuki H. Hazama A. Okada Y. Kawai C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), perhaps resulting from similar G protein interactions. In summary, we have identified that ANP can down-regulate G protein activation in primary cells. Increased GTPase activity in response to ANP alone or active PKG expression is likely to result from the demonstrated novel cross-talk between PKG and RGS proteins. ANP also accelerates GTPase activation in the combined setting with ET-3 by a mechanism that is probably independent of RGS translocation. This latter observation provides a mechanism to understand the previously demonstrated down-regulation of signaling in response to GPCR ligation (8.Prins B.A. Weber M.J. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Daniels M.

Further understanding of these interactions could lead to therapeutic intervention in unwanted proliferation, because several pharmacologic agents that stimulate PKG activation are in clinical use for other purposes. We thank T. M. Lincoln for the expression vector for the constituitively active catalytic subunit of PKG-I and K. Druey for RGS4 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2320060623,"Hormones are specialized mitogens that stimulate proliferation in their differentiated target cells. Thyrotropin (TSH), the physiologic regulator of thyroid cells, stimulates cAMP-mediated proliferation and thyroid-specific gene expression. The mitogenic effects of TSH require Ras, therefore Ras activation should be compatible with the maintenance of thyroid differentiation. However, expression of activated Ras extinguishes the differentiated phenotype of thyroid cells. One explanation for this apparent paradox is the selective utilization of Ras effector pathways. We tested the hypothesis that Ras signaling through PI3K mediates the mitogenic effects of TSH in cells which retain their differentiated character. Expression of a Ras effector mutant (RasV12S35) that signals preferentially through Raf-1, although sufficient to confer TSH-independent proliferation, abolished hormone-regulated expression of thyroglobulin and the sodium/iodide symporter. In contrast, expression of a Ras mutant (RasV12C40) that binds selectively to PI3K conferred TSH-independent proliferation without marked effects on thyroid-specific gene expression. Unlike the inhibitory effects of TSH on the proliferation of RasV12S35-expressing cells, TSH enhanced RasV12C40-stimulated proliferation by further increasing the activity of p70s6k, an important mediator of the mitogenic effects of TSH and RasV12C40. These results demonstrate that channeling Ras-dependent signals to PI3K confers TSH with the ability to stimulate proliferation in differentiated cells."

We use a variety of membrane isolation techniques (subcellular fractionation, plasma membrane vesiculation to isolate pure plasma membrane fractions, and enveloped viruses to sample cellular membranes) to provide direct evidence that free GPIs are not confined to their site of synthesis, the endoplasmic reticulum, but can redistribute to populate other subcellular organelles. Over short labeling periods (2.5 h), radiolabeled GPIs were found at similar concentration in all subcellular fractions with the exception of a mitochondria-enriched fraction where GPI concentration was low. Pulse-chase experiments over extended chase periods showed that although the total amount of cellular radiolabeled GPIs decreased, the plasma membrane complement of labeled GPIs increased. GPIs at the plasma membrane were found to populate primarily the exoplasmic leaflet as detected using periodate oxidation of the cell surface. Transport of GPIs to the cell surface was inhibited by Brefeldin A and blocked at 15 °C, suggesting that GPIs are transported to the plasma membrane via a vesicular mechanism.

Although these glycolipids were originally discovered covalently linked to eukaryotic cell surface glycoproteins, many cells contain large pools of non-protein-linked or “free” GPIs. In mammalian cells, estimates of the pool size of mature free GPIs (potential protein anchor precursors) range from 105 to 107 molecules/cell (4.Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol.

The potential functions of free GPIs are a matter for speculation, although numerous proposals exist that place these molecules in signal transduction pathways (reviewed in Refs. 6.Field M.C.

Indeed, recent data indicate that free GPIs are essential for growth in the protozoan parasite Leishmania mexicana, although their precise mode of action remains to be determined (8.Ilgoutz S.C.

To gain insight into the biological significance of free GPI molecules, it is important to define their subcellular distribution and understand the pathways by which they are biosynthesized, turned over, and transported among various cellular membranes. The sequence of reactions involved in GPI assembly is relatively well defined, and genetic approaches have identified a number of gene products that are required for the assembly process (9.Takeda J.

Synthesis of the first GPI intermediate, GlcNAc-PI, occurs uniformly throughout the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas post-initiation GPI biosynthetic reactions are concentrated in a mitochondria-associated ER domain (13.Vidugiriene J.

Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although the precise membrane topology of GPI assembly remains to be determined, analyses of biosynthesis requirements and transbilayer distribution of GPIs suggest that mannosylated GPI structures, including the anchor precursors, can undergo transbilayer movement (8.Ilgoutz S.C.

Subsequently, free mammalian GPIs were shown to be constituents of the plasma membrane-derived lipid envelope of influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (5.van't Hof W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and were detected at the cell surface using amine-reactive membrane-impermeant reagents (24.Singh N. Liang L.-N. Tykocinski M.L. Tartakoff A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12879-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GPIs were also identified by chemical radiolabeling in a plasma membrane fraction from rat liver (25.Deeg M.A. Murray N.R. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18581-18588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provided the first indications that GPIs are exported from their site of synthesis. However, more detailed analyses are clearly required to obtain a quantitative picture of the subcellular distribution of GPIs and an understanding of GPI transport mechanisms. In this study we use metabolic radiolabeling in conjunction with membrane isolation techniques to provide direct evidence that free GPIs, following their synthesis in the ER, redistribute to all major subcellular organelles, including the Golgi and plasma membrane. We show that although the membrane concentration of metabolically radiolabeled GPIs under short term continuous labeling conditions (2.5 h) is roughly equal in all fractions derived from a post-mitochondrial supernatant, GPIs are slowly concentrated in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane over extended chase periods. Our analyses show that cell surface display of GPIs requires vesicular transport through the Golgi apparatus and occurs at a rate similar to that with which proteins are secreted into the extracellular medium. The accumulation of GPIs at the plasma membrane occurs in concert with catabolic/turnover processes that reduce the total cellular content of radiolabeled GPIs. d-[2-3H]Mannose (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). l-[3-3H]Serine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

MDCK and HeLa cell lines were cultured as cell monolayers under the conditions described for thymoma cells. Thymoma cells (5 × 108) were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in low glucose (0.1 mg/ml) RPMI 1640 medium (107 cells/ml) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were preincubated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin for 30 min at 37 °C and labeled for 2.5 h withd-[2-3H]mannose (5–10 μCi/ml). After labeling, the cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were homogenized using a nitrogen cavitation bomb (Kontes Glass Company, Vineland, NJ), and the resulting homogenate was treated with DNase I (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove large debri and nuclei. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to yield supernatant (S10) and pellet (P10) fractions. P10 and S10 were analyzed directly or subjected to further fractionation as described below. S10 was fractionated as described previously (14.Vidugiriene J. Menon A.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig. 2 A. Briefly, S10 corresponding to 5 × 108 cell equivalents was layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing 1.5 ml of 38% sucrose, 1 ml of 35% sucrose, 1 ml of 30% sucrose, and 0.8 ml of 20% sucrose (all prepared in 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT). Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g (Beckman Ti 50 rotor, 39,000 rpm, 2.5 h), fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A. Fractions were pooled together depending on the distribution of marker enzyme activities. Typically, three major fractions were isolated (Fig. 2 A). Fraction 1 contained the 20% sucrose step, including the 20/30% sucrose interface. Fraction 2 contained the 30/35% sucrose interface, and fraction 3 consisted of the rest of the gradient including the pellet. P10 (10–15 mg/ml protein) was washed twice with buffer A and then resuspended in buffer A for enzyme activity measurement and lipid extraction. For further fractionation, P10 was resuspended in isolation buffer (250 mm mannitol, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA) and resolved into mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) and mitochondria (Mito) following previously established procedures (13.Vidugiriene J.

Briefly, P10 was layered on top of a 20-ml solution of 30% (v/v) Percoll (prepared in 225 mm mannitol, 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA) in a centrifuge tube. Following 30 min of centrifugation at 95,000 × g, a light diffuse upper band and a denser lower band were collected manually and diluted ∼5-fold with buffer A. The diluted denser lower band was subjected to centrifugation for 20 min at 10,000 × g to yield pellet and supernatant fractions. The pellet derived from the dense lower band was resuspended in buffer A; based on marker-enzyme analysis (Fig. 3 B) it was determined to be enriched in mitochondria and termed Mito. The supernatant was combined with the diluted diffuse upper band and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to pellet MAM. The protein content of each fraction was determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Half of each fraction was taken for lipid extraction to determine phospholipid and GPI content. Labeled lipids were extracted and analyzed as described below. Total phospholipid content was determined following hydrolysis and phosphate measurement (29.Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). To determine the lipid profile of each fraction, bulk lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30.Bligh F.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Lipids were analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (35:15:6:2:1, v/v/v/v/v), followed by hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v) (31.Macala L.J., Yu, R.K.

The resulting bands were identified by comigration with standards and were quantitated by digital densitometry using NIH Image program. Fractions were also characterized by measuring organelle-specific marker enzyme activities or by determining the amount of marker proteins via Western blot analysis. The following marker enzyme activities were assayed using procedures described by Storrie and Madden (32.Storrie B. Madden E.

The ER proteins ribophorin I and BiP (GRP78) and the mitochondrial proteins Hsp60 and Hsp70 were quantitated using standard Western blotting procedures. After probing with primary antibodies, blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Western blotting detection system following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Band intensities were determined by densitometry (at least two different amounts of protein (typically 1 and 2.5 μg) were analyzed, and several different film exposures were obtained to verify linearity of the film response for densitometric analysis). The distribution of marker enzyme activities in P10 and S10 fractions has been reported previously (13.Vidugiriene J. Sharma D.K. Smith T.K. Baumann N.A. Menon A.K. J. Biol.

Briefly, approximately 85% of total mitochondrial or lysosomal activity and 90% of total peroxisomal activity present in the cell homogenate was recovered in P10. In addition, the P10 fraction contained ∼20% and 20–40% of major subcellular organelles such as plasma membrane or ER, respectively, but only minor amounts (less than 10%) of Golgi/endosomes. In contrast, the S10 fraction was enriched in ER (60–80%), plasma membrane (∼70%), and Golgi/endosomes (80–90%) and contained only minor amounts of peroxisomal (5%), mitochondrial (15%), or lysosomal (10%) marker enzyme activity.Table IPattern of recovery of organelle-specific markers in subcellular fractions from thymoma cellsSourceaSource for fractionation analysis.

Menon A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24150-24155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The extract was desalted by n-butyl alcohol-water partitioning and analyzed by TLC (silica 60; chloroform/methanol/water, 10:10:3, v/v/v). TLC plates were scanned for radioactivity with a linear scanner (Berthold LB2842), and GPI species, identified by TLC mobility and diagnostic treatment with GPI-specific phospholipase D, were quantitated using the scanner's integration software. MDCK cell monolayers were grown to 80–90% confluence (approximately 107cells/plate). Monolayers were washed several times with PBS followed by the addition of 7 ml of labeling medium consisting of low glucose (0.1 mg/ml) RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. GPIs were metabolically radiolabeled by incubating the cells with 20 μCi/ml d-[2-3H]mannose for 6 h. At the end of the labeling incubation period, the cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with vaccinia virus (VV) or VSV as described below. Typically, 6–12 (150 mm) plates were used for each virus experiment, and mock-treated MDCK cells were used as control samples. GPI extraction and analysis were performed as described above. Cells were infected with 5 plaque-forming units/cell of VV (IHD-J strain) for 24 h. The two intracellular forms of VV were purified essentially as described previously (35.Cluett E.B. Machamer C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2121-2131PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, scraped and pelleted cells were ruptured in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, using a Dounce homogenizer with a large clearance. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove a large portion of cellular membranes, the resulting post-nuclear supernatant was sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 5 min at room temperature. The sonicated supernatant was layered onto a continuous sucrose gradient (25–50%, w/v) and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. A faint band about halfway down the gradient and a denser band further down the gradient (corresponding to the IEV and IMV forms of VV, respectively; cell membranes did not penetrate the gradient and banded at the sucrose/load interface) were collected by hand, diluted 4–5-fold with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 9.0) buffer, and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (20 min, 4 °C) in an SW 28 rotor to collect IEV and IMV particles. The purity of the IMV and IEV fractions was assessed as described (35.Cluett E.B. Machamer C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2121-2131PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1964861274,"We recently reported that E2F1 could transactivate the p21 promoter via cis-acting elements between -119 to +16 bp of the p21 gene. Here we show that activated V12-H-Ras can induce the p21 promoter through the same region of the p21 promoter by a p53-independent mechanism in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, activated Ras was not able to induce the p21 promoter in E2F1-/- fibroblasts, suggesting that E2F1 is required for induction of the p21 promoter by activated Ras. Cotransfection of increasing concentrations of dominant negative E2F1 alone, or with dominant negative DP1 into NIH3T3 cells suppressed induction of the p21 promoter by activated Ras. These data suggest that p53-independent induction of the p21 promoter by activated Ras is mediated at least in part by E2F1. Oncogene (2000) 19, 961 - 964."
https://openalex.org/W2326395413,"Since defects in molecular mechanisms controlling DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis could modify cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, we have conducted a multiparametric molecular analysis for better understanding the regulation pathways leading to cell survival or cell death after irradiation. Using a human lymphoblastoid cell line, we have analysed, following gamma irradiation (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 Gy, at 0.5, 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment), the correlation between proliferation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis and micronuclei frequency with the expression of TP53, WAF1, DNA LIGASE 1, PCNA, BAX, BLC-2, BAK, DAD1, ICH1-Long and -Short forms mRNAs. We have found that whereas TP53, BAK, ICH1-Short form, and DAD1 were expressed at constant levels, WAF1, PCNA, BAX were up-regulated, ICH1-Long form, DNA LIGASE 1, and BCL-2 were down-regulated. These modifications of expression were significantly correlated with doses, survival, proliferation, cell cycle delays, and apoptosis. A positive correlation of WAF1 and BAX, and a borderline negative correlation with BCL-2 expressions were observed with micronuclei frequency for doses ranging from 0.5 to 4 Gy. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that gene expression profiling, which is easier and more rapid to conduct than the assessments of classical phenotypic responses, could be useful to improve knowledge concerning pathways involved in cellular response to irradiation, knowing that such biomarkers could constitute tools to assess radio-sensitivity/radio-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2314948125,"HePTP is a tyrosine specific protein phosphatase that is strongly expressed in activated T-cells. It was recently demonstrated that in transfected T-cells HePTP impairs TCR-mediated activation of the MAP-kinase family members ERK2 and p38 and it was suggested that both ERK and p38 MAP-kinases are substrates of HePTP. The HePTP gene has been mapped to human chromosome 1q32.1. Abnormalities in this region are frequently found in various hematopoietic malignancies. HePTP is highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and its expression in fibroblasts resulted in transformation. To address a possible involvement of HePTP in hematopoietic malignancies we sought to identify HePTP substrate(s) in leukemic cells. Using substrate trapping mutants we have identified the MAP-kinase ERK2 as a specific target of HePTP in the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Tyrosine phosphorylated ERK2, but not ERK1, p38, or JNK1, efficiently bound to catalytically inactive HePTP mutants in which the active site cysteine (HePTP-C/S) or the conserved aspartic acid residue (HePTP-D/A) had been exchanged for serine and alanine, respectively. Moreover, the interaction of ERK2 with HePTP trapping mutants was dependent on ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that HePTP is specifically targeted to activated ERK2. Using a deletion mutant of HePTP (HePTP-dLD), in which 14 amino acid residues within the N-terminus are missing, we show that regions outside the catalytic domain are also required for the interaction. Furthermore, overexpression of HePTP in K562 cells and fibroblasts interfered with PMA or growth factor induced MAP-kinase activation and HePTP efficiently dephosphorylated active ERK2 on the tyrosine residue in the activation loop in vitro. Together, these data identify ERK2 as a specific and direct target of HePTP and are consistent with a model in which HePTP negatively regulates ERK2 activity as part of a feedback mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2063583488,"Radiation resistance is a hallmark of human melanoma, and yet mechanisms underlying this resistance are not well understood. We recently established the role of ATF2 in this process, suggesting that stress kinases, which contribute to regulation of ATF2 stability and activity, play an important role in the acquisition of such resistance. Here we demonstrate that changes in the expression and respective activities of TRAF2/GCK occur during melanoma development and regulate its sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis. Comparing early- and late-stage melanoma cells revealed low expression of TRAF2 and GCK in early-stage melanoma, which coincided with poor resistance to UV-induced, TNF-mediated apoptosis; forced expression of GCK alone or in combination with TRAF2 efficiently increased JNK and NF-κB activities, which coincided with increased protection against apoptosis. Conversely, forced expression of the dominant negative form of TRAF2 or GCK in late-stage melanoma cells reduced NF-κB activity and decreased Fas expression, resulting in a lower degree of UV-induced, Fas-mediated cell death. Our results illustrate a mechanism in which protection from, or promotion of, UV-induced melanoma cell death depends on the nature of the apoptotic cascade (TNF or Fas) and on the availability of TRAF2/GCK, whose expression increases during melanoma progression."

NBs consist of several components, including interferon (IFN)-induced proteins such as PML and the primary biliary cirrhosis autoantigen Sp100 (5.Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. J.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 871-876PubMed Google Scholar). NB components seem to be involved in gene regulation, control of cell growth, and apoptosis. Infection of cells by various viruses influences the composition and integrity of NBs, suggesting a function of NBs in early viral infection and antiviral response (2.Sternsdorf T. Grotzinger T. Jensen K. Will H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 307-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 3.Maul G. Bioassays. 1998; 20: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). For example, the immediate early gene product ICP0 of herpes simplex virus-type I associates with NBs in the early phase of infection and leads to a complete loss of NB-specific staining (7.Maul G.G. Guldner H.H. Spivack J.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2679-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In contrast, infection with influenza A virus (FLUAV) increases the number and staining intensity of NBs in much the same way as does treatment with type I IFN (5.Guldner H.H. Szostecki C. Grotzinger T. Will H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4067-4073PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PML contributes to the antiviral state induced in IFN-treated cells by having selective antiviral activity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and FLUAV but not encephalomyocarditis virus (8.Chelbi-Alix M.K. Quignon F. Pelicano L. Koken M.H. de Thé H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IFN-induced murine Mx1 protein forms nuclear dots (9.Dreiding P.

Mx proteins are large guanine triphosphatases (GTPases) that are tightly regulated by type I IFNs (11.Staeheli P. Pitossi F. Pavlovic J.

Epiz. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The antiviral mechanism of Mx proteins is still poorly understood, and it has been proposed that they require the help of constitutive host cell factors for their function and antiviral specificity (14.Schneider-Schaulies S.

To identify cellular factors possibly involved in antiviral or other functions of Mx proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library, using MxA as a bait. Here we report the identification and characterization of a 127-kDa protein kinase that interacts with Mx protein family members and hence is termed PKM for Mx-interacting protein kinase. A two-hybrid library, representing mRNAs expressed in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells infected with Thogoto virus (THOV strain SiAr126 (17.Albanese M. Bruno-Smiraglia C. Di Cuonzo G. Lavagnino A. Srihongse S. Acta Virol. 1972; 267: 267Google Scholar)), was constructed in the HybriZAP vector (Stratagene). Poly(A)+-selected RNA was used to synthesize the cDNA library following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The resulting library pAD-BHK/THOV consisted of 2.4 × 106independent clones with an average size of 1300 base pairs. The bait plasmid, pBD-MxA, was constructed by cloning nucleotides 236–2243 of human MxA (18.Aebi M. Fäh J. Hurt N. Samuel C.E. Thomis D. Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5062-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) into pBD-GAL4 (Stratagene). The two-hybrid library screen was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Briefly, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain YRG-2 was sequentially transformed with the bait plasmid pBD-MxA and the pAD-BHK/THOV library DNA using the lithium acetate method. MxA-interacting proteins were identified by growth on SD minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Positive clones were verified by assessing their interaction with pBD-MxA versus two control baits, pBD-GAL4 and pBD-NP, the latter encoding a THOV nucleoprotein-GAL4 DNA binding domain hybrid. The 5′-end of clone 512 was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE; Life Technologies, Inc.) with RNA of BHK-21 cells and two internal primers (nucleotides 959–930 and 701–672 of the later PKM cDNA). The 5′-extended open reading frame (ORF) of clone 512 was amplified from BHK-21 RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and was combined with clone 216 using a uniqueApaLI restriction site within the overlapping region. The resulting full-length ORF was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCatch (19.Georgiev O. Bourquin J.P. Gstaiger M. Knoepfel L. Schaffner W. Hovens C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) yielding the plasmid pC-PKM. For expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, the ORF of clone 512 was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) yielding pGEX-PKM-(148–925). Mutant PKM (K221W) was generated by replacing the codon for lysine 221 with the codon for tryptophan utilizing QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The introduced mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Embryonic fibroblast cells of the mouse strains A2G and BALB.A2G-Mx (20.Staeheli P. Sutcliffe J.G. Mol. Cell.

RNA was extracted from BHK-21 cells. Either 15 μg of total RNA or 1 μg of poly(A)+-selected RNA were separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel containing 3.7% formaldehyde and blotted to nylon NY13 membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were probed with radioactively labeled cDNA fragments corresponding either to nucleotide 1–701 or nucleotide 2293–2953 of PKM-cDNA. For high level protein expression of FLAG-tagged PKM, COS-1 cells were transfected with pC-PKM using the calcium phosphate method. After 5 h, cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus vTF7–3 (10 plaque-forming units/cell (22.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PKM was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using anti-FLAG antibodies. For expression of GST fusion proteins, E. coli XL2-Blue cells were transformed with pGEX-PKM-(148–925), and GST fusion proteins were purified using immobilized glutathione (23.Kochs G. Trost M.

The reaction was started by the addition of 4 μl of 1 mm ATP supplemented with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Murine embryonic cells (A2G and BALB.A2G-Mx) were transfected with pC-PKM using the calcium phosphate method. After 5 h, the cells were treated with 2000 units/ml IFN-αB/D (30.Horisberger M.A. Hochkeppel H.K. J. Interferon. Res. 1987; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for 16 h and subsequently stained as described (31.Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged PKM was labeled with a monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Integra Biosciences), and murine Mx1 was detected by a specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum (31.Ponten A. Sick C. Weeber M. Haller O. Kochs G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2591-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antiserum specific for Sp100 was kindly provided by T. Sternsdorf, Heinrich-Pette-Institut, Hamburg, Germany. In a yeast two-hybrid search for cellular and viral interaction partners of human MxA, two overlapping cDNA clones were isolated from a cDNA library of THOV-infected BHK-21 cells. They encode parts of the ORF of a putative serine/threonine kinase. To obtain the full-length ORF, the cDNA was extended by 5′-RACE (32.Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Within this extension, a translational start codon was present at position 174–176. The resulting full-length cDNA had a length of 3909 base pairs and coded for a protein of 127 kDa. Sequence analyses located a conserved protein kinase domain (33.Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 3-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) in the N-terminal half of the protein as well as PEST sequences (34.Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar) in the C terminus (Fig.1 A). The full-length protein, the two original fragments, and their overlapping region showed clear interactions with human MxA and mouse Mx1 protein in the two-hybrid assay, indicating the presence of a putative Mx interaction domain (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, the kinase was named PKM, forprotein kinase interacting with Mx proteins. However, pull-down assays or co-immunoprecipitations failed to reveal a direct biochemical interaction between PKM and MxA (data not shown), indicating that stable complexes are not readily formed under these conditions. It has been notoriously difficult to demonstrate direct binding of MxA with putative cellular or viral interaction partners (23.Kochs G. Trost M. Janzen Ch. Haller O. Methods: Comp. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 15: 255-263Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35.Stranden A. Staeheli P. Pavlovic J. Virology. 1993; 197: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen whether a weak or transient interaction of Mx proteins with PKM will be demonstrable in the future, using more sensitive technologies. A data base search revealed similarities with several protein kinases, some of which are listed in Table I. PKM showed the highest identity (98.1%) to the recently described murine homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) (16.Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S-J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). HIPK2 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen by its ability to interact with NK homeodomain transcription factors. Together with HIPK1 and HIPK3, it constitutes a novel family of HIPKs that modulate the transcriptional activities of homeoproteins (16.Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S-J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HIPK2 differs from PKM in 19 amino acid residues distributed over the C-terminal part of the protein and in having an insertion of 27 amino acids (amino acids 588–614) (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the putative Mx interaction domain has 40 amino acids in common with the homeoprotein interaction domain (Fig. 1 B). Sequence similarities extending beyond the catalytic domain were also found between PKM and the rat androgen receptor-interacting protein kinase (48.8%; (36.Moilanen A.M. Karvonen U. Poukka H. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2527-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) as well as the human YAK1-related protein kinase PKY (46.6% (37.Begley D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Sampson K.E. Abraham I. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 200: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). In addition, the catalytic domain of PKM showed strong similarity to the equivalent domain of the YAK1-related rat kinase DYRK, which is a dual specificity protein kinase catalyzing phosphorylation on both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (38.Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 39.Song W.J. Sternberg L.R. Kasten-Sportes C. Keuren M.L. Chung S.H. Slack A.C. Miller D.E. Glover T.W.

Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The sequence data indicate that PKM is a new member of the growing family of homeodomain-interacting protein kinases.Table IComparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of PKM and related kinasesPercent nucleotide and amino acid identities were determined using the Clustal algorithm (MegAlign program/LASERGENE Software). Open table in a new tab Percent nucleotide and amino acid identities were determined using the Clustal algorithm (MegAlign program/LASERGENE Software). Gene expression of PKM was investigated in BHK-21 cells. Northern blot analysis of total RNA detected three transcripts of 15.0, 6.3, and 4.3 kilobases (Fig. 2). All three bands represented PKM-specific transcripts that were detectable with two independent probes (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). They could not be detected in RNase-treated samples (data not shown), indicating that the 15.0-kilobase signal represented an RNA transcript. When poly(A)+-selected RNA was used instead of total RNA, a single mRNA species corresponding to the 4.3-kilobase transcript was detected (Fig. 2, lane 3). Therefore, we conclude that PKM is expressed in BHK-21 cells and that the 4.3-kilobase band represents the mature polyadenylated mRNA. The larger transcripts most likely represent incompletely processed transcripts lacking a poly(A) tail. The expression level of PKM was not altered by infection with two different orthomyxoviruses, namely FLUAV and THOV, or by treatment with 2000 units/ml IFN-αB/D (30.Horisberger M.A. Hochkeppel H.K. J. Interferon. Res. 1987; 7: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) for 16 h (not shown). To demonstrate that PKM has protein kinase activity, a recombinant GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity adsorption on glutathione-agarose beads. Because the full-length 127-kDa kinase could not be obtained in substantial amounts, a PKM fragment (amino acids 148–925) containing the entire kinase domain but lacking N- and C-terminal sequences was expressed as a GST fusion protein. The purified GST-PKM-(148–925) protein showed the expected apparent molecular weight of 120,000 as revealed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). A second band with an apparent molecular weight of 85,000 was observed, which most likely represented a major degradation product. GST-PKM-(148–925) catalyzed autophosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay, demonstrating kinase activity of the fusion protein (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The 85-kDa degradation product was also phosphorylated. To exclude the possibility that the observed 32P incorporation was caused by a contaminating protein kinase, a kinase-defective mutant was generated. Within the ATP binding site of PKM, lysine 221 was changed to tryptophan (K221W) corresponding to a mutation in Raf-1 that abolished its kinase activity (41.Kölch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). As expected, the mutant protein GST-PKM-(148–925, K221W) lacked kinase activity (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2and 4). Compared with GST-PKM-(148–925), the mutant protein exhibited a slightly higher mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 A,lane 2) most likely reflecting the absence of phosphate groups. These findings demonstrate that PKM has intrinsic kinase activity. To further characterize the activity of PKM, in vitro kinase assays were performed with exogenous substrates. Fig. 3 Bshows that E. coli-expressed GST-PKM-(148–925) catalyzed32P incorporation into classical substrates as histone, casein, and myelin basic protein but failed to phosphorylate bovine serum albumin. Purified MxA protein produced in E. coli was not phosphorylated by PKM, also not in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog GTPγS known to stabilize the activated conformation of MxA (28.Kochs G. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4370-4376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the E. coli-produced nucleoprotein (NP) of THOV was phosphorylated by GST-PKM-(148–925), whereas the same protein purified from virus particles was not (Fig. 3 B). Because NPs of orthomyxoviruses are phosphoproteins (42.Kistner O. Müller K. Scholtissek C. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 2421-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the relevant residues were already equipped with a phosphate group preventing further phosphorylation by PKM. The cellular protein kinases that mediate phosphorylation of THOV NP in infected cells are presently not known. It remains to be seen whether PKM or other HIPK family members are involved. To investigate the kinase specificity of full-length PKM, a cDNA coding for FLAG-tagged full-length PKM was expressed in COS-1 cells using the vaccinia T7 polymerase system (22.Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared, and PKM was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. The immobilized PKM showed autophosphorylation activity and accepted cellular as well as viral proteins as substrates (Fig. 3 C). Thus, PKM phosphorylated the E. coli-produced phosphoprotein of VSV and the NPs of FLUAV (FLUAV NP) and THOV (THOV NP). A full-length kinase-inactive mutant PKM (K221W) was found to exhibit no kinase activity (data not shown). These data demonstrate that full-length PKM has kinase activity and phosphorylates a similar set of proteins as the truncated GST-PKM-(148–925). The kinase domain of PKM showed high sequence homology to conserved kinase domain of DYRK (Table I). This dual specificity protein kinase is able to phosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (38.Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These kinases share the domains common to all serine/threonine kinases but have otherwise no known motives predicting dual specificity (43.Lindberg R.A. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 114-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We therefore checked the specificity of PKM by phosphoamino acid analyses of PKM substrates. Fig. 3 D shows that PKM catalyzed its own phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. THOV NP was phosphorylated preferentially on serines, whereas casein was phosphorylated on threonines. No evidence for tyrosin phosphorylation was found, indicating that PKM is a true serine/threonine kinase, rather than a dual-specific kinase. Finally, we investigated the subcellular localization of PKM. FLAG-tagged PKM was transiently expressed in mouse primary embryo cells (Fig. 4 A) as well as in human T98G, COS-1, and Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown). It localized to distinct spots within the nucleus, demonstrating that PKM is a nuclear protein kinase. Because the dot-like appearance of nuclear PKM much resembled the intranuclear distribution of PML, we investigated whether PKM was found in NBs of IFN-treated and PKM-transfected cells, using Sp100 as a marker protein (2.Sternsdorf T. Grotzinger T. Jensen K. Will H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 307-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that PKM indeed colocalized with Sp100 in distinct nuclear dots, suggesting that PKM belongs to the NB-associated cellular proteins. The PKM-related kinase HIPK2 was also detected in nuclear speckles (16.Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S-J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 44.Kim Y.H. Cheol Y.C. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that HIPKs may be a group of kinases that preferentially associate with NBs. Recent data by Kim et al. (44.Kim Y.H. Cheol Y.C. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) demonstrate that HIPK2 is modified by the small ubiquitin-like protein SUMO-1. It has previously been shown that posttranslational modification by SUMO-1 directs a subset of nuclear proteins to the NBs (2.Sternsdorf T. Grotzinger T. Jensen K. Will H. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 307-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 45.Müller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The organized structure of NBs is disturbed in a number of pathological processes, indicating that the integrity of NBs is important for distinct cellular functions (1.Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1998; 280: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 2.Sternsdorf T. Grotzinger T. Jensen K. Will H.

NBs reportedly play a role in growth control, cell transformation, cellular stress responses, and IFN action. The fact that IFNs up-regulate some NB-associated proteins and the recent finding that viruses have evolved strategies to disrupt or reorganize NBs suggest that NBs may have a significant role in virus-host interactions. Interestingly, Mx1 was described to be localized in or partially associated to NBs (10.Chelbi-Alix M.K. Pelicano L. Quignon F. Koken M.H. Venturini L. Stadler M. Pavlovic J. Degos L. de Thé H. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 2027-2033PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, both SUMO-1 and the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 (10.Chelbi-Alix M.K. Pelicano L. Quignon F. Koken M.H. Venturini L. Stadler M.

Trost, unpublished observations. Double immunofluorescence staining of IFN-treated and PKM-transfected primary mouse embryo cells showed a similar nuclear distribution of PKM and murine Mx1 (Fig. 4 B). It remains to be seen whether Mx GTPases and HIPKs are involved in the maintenance of NB structure and function during physiological or pathological cellular processes.

https://openalex.org/W1969873107,"A potential link between DNA repair and de novo methylation of exogenous sequences in colorectal cancer cell lines suggested that cells deficient in mismatch repair (MMR-) had an increased ability to silence the introduced virus promoter by DNA methylation due to the presence of a methylator phenotype (MET+) (Lengauer et al., 1997a). We explored this relationship in more detail and found that although there was a clear difference in the abilities of MMR+ cells to express the viral promoter compared to their MMR- counterparts, this difference was not consistently explained by levels of methylation in the viral promoter. Furthermore, we were unable to distinguish differences between the levels of methylation of six endogenous known CpG islands or 100 random DNA fragments containing CCGG sites within the cells. No consistent differences between the abilities of the cells to methylate the CpG island in exon 2 of the p16 gene were observed after transient demethylation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine nor in the levels of expression of three human methyltransferase enzymes. Our results do not therefore support the existence of mutually exclusive DNA methylation (MET) and DNA repair (MMR) phenotypes. Oncogene (2000) 19, 943 - 952."

Luscher B. Adv. Cancer. Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human c-mycgene is composed of three exons (2.Lang J.C. Whitelaw B. Talbot S. Wilkie N.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 9: 62-66Google Scholar). The first exon is untranslated and contains two principal promoters: P2, which is the predominant c-myc promoter, generating up to 90% of all transcripts, and P1, which is separated from P2 by 165 bp1 and generates 10–25% of c-myc RNA (3.Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All minor promoters, including P0 (located 750 bp 5′ of P2), P3 (in the first intron), and an antisense promoter (found in the second intron), generate less than 5% of c-myc mRNA. The human c-myc gene encodes two polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 64 and 67 kDa (4.Hann S.R. King M.W. Bentley D.L. Anderson C.W. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1988; 52: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The c-Myc proteins contain a basic region, which mediates sequence-specific DNA-binding, and also helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper motifs, which promote protein-protein interactions (1.Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer. Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heterodimers formed by MYC and its partner MAX are able to bind DNA and function as transcription activators (5.Kretzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N.

The c-myc locus is interrupted by reciprocal chromosomal translocation in human Burkitt's lymphoma and murine plasmacytomas (11.Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1986; 45: 485-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Collectively, each of these perturbations results in the constitutive activation of c-myc transcription. Unlike the ras gene family, mutations within the coding sequences appear not to be an important feature in convertingmyc from a proto-oncogene to an oncogene. Rather, abnormally high transcription of c-myc, at an inappropriate stage of the cell cycle or during differentiation, leads to oncogenic transformation (2.Lang J.C. Whitelaw B. Talbot S. Wilkie N.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 9: 62-66Google Scholar). Therefore, to define the precise role of the c-myc gene in tumorigenesis, a better understanding of its regulation is warranted. Regulation of c-myc expression is extremely complicated and may occur at the levels of transcription initiation (12.Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), transcript elongation (3.Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1985; 42: 589-597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At the level of initiation of transcription, regulation appears to occur via cis-acting regulatory elements (2.Lang J.C. Whitelaw B. Talbot S. Wilkie N.M. Br. J.

Although two enhancer elements have been described, 3′ of the c-mycexons (14.Mautner J. Joos S. Werner T. Eick D. Bornkamm G.W. Polack A.

Biol. 1992; 12: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A palindromic purine/pyrimidine-rich positive regulatory element, also described as DNase I hypersensitivity site III1, has been identified in positions −142 to −115 relative to the P2 promoter (20.Postel E.H.

Cell. 1984; 37: 381-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A negative regulatory element located between bp −293 and 253, relative to the P1 promoter, has been shown to interact with a transcription factor complex formed by Fos, Jun, and octamer-binding factors (22.Hay N. Takimoto M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23.Takimoto M. Quinn J.P. Farina A.R. Staudt L.M. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8992-8999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional regulatory element about 2.2 kilobase pairs upstream of P1 was found to bind nuclear proteins (24.Ariga H. Imamura Y. Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4273-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25.Iguchi-Ariga S.M.M. Okazaki T. Itani T. Ogata M. Sato Y. Ariga H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, all promoter elements and their cognate binding proteins that are necessary for optimal transcription initiation have yet to be fully characterized. Furthermore, the significance of many of these binding sites and their corresponding factors, during physiological regulation of c-mycexpression, remains largely unknown. c-myc is known to be a cytokine-responsive gene (26.Reed J.C Nowell P.C. Hoover R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4221-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Among several cytokines, interleukin-2 (IL-2) is one of the critical regulators of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. The functional interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of three subunits: the IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ chains. Both IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ subunits are required to transmit the IL-2 signal to the cell interior (27.Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 28.Miyazaki T. Liu Z.J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Permutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region of IL-2Rβ, termed the serine-rich region, has been shown to play a critical role in IL-2-mediated c-myc induction followed by cell proliferation (27.Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 28.Miyazaki T. Liu Z.J. Kawahara A. Minami Y. Yamada K. Tsujimoto Y. Barsoumian E.L. Permutter R.M. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1995; 81: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of IL-2 in stimulation of c-myc transcription has been confirmed (26.Reed J.C Nowell P.C. Hoover R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4221-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 29.Azzoni L. Anegon I. Calabretta B. Perussia B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 491-499PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kerkhoff E. Ziff E.B.

Cell. 1992; 70: 57-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). IL-2 has been shown to selectively stimulate transcription from the P2 promoter (8.Hoover R.G. Kaushal V. Lary C. Travis P. Sneed T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 194: 257-264PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Broome H.E. Reed J.C. Godillot E.P. Hoover R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2988-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the participating IL-2 response elements and their cognate binding proteins have not yet been identified. Previously, we determined that c-myc transcription is rapidly induced in the Natural Killer cell line NK3.3 in response to exogenous IL-2 (33.Kornbluth J. Hoover R.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3234-3240PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, NK3.3 cells have been chosen as the model IL-2-responsive cell line in our experiments. Using a functional reporter gene assay, we have found an IL-2-responsive element within 537 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the c-myc locus (from bp −1429 to −892 relative to the P2 promoter). Analysis of protein-DNA interactions within this 537-bp region has localized the IL-2-inducible response element and identified its binding protein. Cell culture medium (RPMI) and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Lymphocult was obtained from Biotest (Dreieich, Germany), and recombinant IL-2 was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Poly(dI-dC) and protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were obtained from Bio-Synthesis (Lewisville, TX). Antibodies to STAT proteins (supershift quality, concentration of 1 mg/ml) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to anti-phosphotyrosine for Western blotting were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). All restriction endonucleases, T4 polynucleotide kinase, calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and DNase I were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All reagents for PCR were from Promega (Madison, WI). Natural Killer cell line NK3.3 was used as a model in all experiments. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 15% Lymphocult, penicillin, streptomycin, and l-glutamine. Cells were kept in a humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Prior to stimulation with IL-2, NK3.3 cells were starved for 18 h in the same medium with a decreased concentration (5%) of serum and without Lymphocult. For the purposes of the experiment, cells were stimulated for 1 h with recombinant IL-2 (200 units/ml). A variety of DNA fragments were generated from exon 1 and upstream 5′-flanking sequences of the c-myc locus (Fig. 1 A) and cloned upstream of the promoter-luc+ transcriptional unit into luciferase reporter construct pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). NK3.3 cells (7–10 × 106 cells/sample) were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the appropriate recombinant vector by electroporation at 800 microfarads at 300 V using “CellPorator” (Life Technologies). All transfections were normalized to β-galactosidase activity by cotransfection of 0.5 μg of a β-galactosidase (pRSV-β-Gal) expression vector. Transfected cells were starved for 18 h, as described earlier, and then were split in two sets. One set of cells was left untreated; another was stimulated with recombinant IL-2 (200 units/ml). In 48 h, all cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays, which were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Promega and ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), respectively). The light intensity was measured with a luminometer. To exclude variation due to differences in transfection efficiency, signals obtained with the reporter genes were normalized to the levels of the internal β-galactosidase control at each point. The statistical analysis of the data was performed using “Origin” software (Microcal, Northampton, MA). Generation of the nuclear extract from control and IL-2-stimulated NK3.3 cells was performed according to the procedure described by Marzluff (34.Marzluff W.F. Transcription and Translation. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1984: 91Google Scholar) and Peterson (35.Peterson C.L. Orth K. Calame K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4168-4178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with a modification that included extraction of nuclear proteins with 0.4 m KCl. The protein concentration was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Three types of the double-stranded 32P-end-labeled DNA probes were used in the experiments. A 537-bp probe was generated by digestion of the plasmid pMC41-HE (36.ar-Rushdi A. Nishikura K. Erikson J. Watt R. Rovera G. Groce C.M. Science. 1983; 222: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), containing a 12-kilobase pair c-myc genomic clone, with the restriction endonucleases ClaI andTthIII. A 100-bp probe was the product of the 537-bp fragment digestion with HpaI. A 20-bp probe was the double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′- GCATTTCCAATAATAAAAGG-3′, corresponding to the nucleotide sequence within theClaI–HpaI fragment. A mutated 20-bp probe was designed by substitution TTGTT for TTTCC in the original 20-bp probe. The binding reaction, in EMSA studies, used 10 μg of total protein from nuclear extracts and 1 ng (approximately 20,000–30,000 cpm) of the 32P-end-labeled DNA probe. Incubation was generally performed as described (37.Weber-Nordt R.M. Egen C. Wehinger J. Ludwig W. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Mertelsmann R. Finke J. Blood. 1996; 88: 809-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some corrections. In brief, the binding reaction was carried out for 30 min at room temperature in 25 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) in the presence of 2 μg of nonspecific competitor poly(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 3.5% polyacrylamide gel at 250 V. Supershift experiments were performed to determine the nature of DNA-binding transcription factors, present in the nuclear proteins, using specific antibodies for STAT1 to -5 or normal rabbit IgG (1 mg/ml). 1 μg of corresponding antibodies was added to nuclear protein samples prior to mixing with the probe and kept for 10 min at 4 °C. EMSA was then performed, as described. The “stairway assay” (modification of standard EMSA for localization of protein/DNA-binding sites in large DNA segments with known sequence) was performed as described by Van Wijnen (38.Van Wijnen A.J. Bidwell J. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 400-407PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two samples of 537-bp DNA fragment ClaI–TthIII containing a single 5′-32P-labeled terminus were prepared. Aliquots (25 ng) of each probe were separately digested to completion with each of a series of restriction enzymes chosen to shorten the probe subsequently by 100 bp per cut. After organic extraction and ethanol precipitation, the equimolar quantities of these various shortened DNA fragments were dissolved in TE buffer and used as probes for the standard EMSA protocol. The oligonucleotide sequence TTTCC was replaced by TTGTT in the 100-bp probe using the site-directed mutagenesis procedure described by Ling and Robinson (39.Ling M.M. Robinson B.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and elsewhere. Mutagenesis involved two rounds of PCR using recombinant plasmid pGL3 with a 100-bp insert as a wild type template. First PCR was performed using RVprimer3 from pGL3 plasmid (Promega) as the forward flanking primer and the mutagenic internal primer 5′-TTATTAACAATGCGGTCATGC-3′ (annealing temperature = 58°C). The product of that reaction, the “megaprimer,” was purified by a PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and used, along with the reverse flanking primer Glprimer2 (Promega), as a primer for the second PCR (annealing temperature = 53°C). The final PCR product contained the desired mutation (described above) in a particular DNA sequence. The mutated 100-bp fragment was excised from the PCR product by SacI and XhoI restriction endonucleases (Promega) and cloned into pGL3-promoter vector. The presence of the desired mutation was verified by sequencing with the ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer). The binding reaction was performed as described for electrophoretic mobility shift assay, except the reaction contained 40 μg of the nuclear extract and 4 ng of labeled DNA. After incubation, samples were digested in the same binding buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 with 0.01–0.9 units of DNase I for 2 min. Digested samples were precipitated with ice-cold ethanol in the presence of saturated ammonium acetate and carrier tRNA, washed twice with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in the electrophoresis loading buffer to 10,000 cpm/μl. Equal counts were loaded onto 6% acrylamide/8 m urea sequencing gel. The relative intensity of radioactive bands was determined by PhosphorImager analysis, utilizing a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Autoradiographic bands were quantified within the linear range of film on a model 300A laser densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). NK3.3 cells (107 cells/sample) were starved for 18 h prior to IL-2 stimulation and then treated with 200 units/ml of recombinant IL-2 for 1 h. Untreated (control) and IL-2-treated cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For Immunoprecipitation, lysis supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of specific polyclonal antibodies (anti-JAK2 or anti-STAT4) for 1 h at 4 °C. 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose was then added to each sample for an additional incubation, with agitation, at 4 °C for 1 h. Precipitated proteins were separated on 7.5% Laemmli polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, and followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with chemiluminescent SuperSignal Substrate for Western blotting (Pierce). To identify the region of the human c-myc gene essential for IL-2-regulated transcriptional activity, various luciferase reporter constructs were assembled. These constructs incorporated the known and putative c-mycregulatory regions, including exon 1 and upstream 5′-flanking sequences (2500 bp linked to the P2 promoter, described in Fig.1 A). These regions were cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter in the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-promoter. We measured luciferase activity in lysates of NK3.3 cells transiently transfected with the aforementioned constructs. None of the constructs was able to increase the level of luciferase activity in untreated cells. Upon stimulation of the transfected cells with recombinant IL-2, only the constructs containing the fragmentClaI–TthIII (bp −1429 to −892 relative to P2 promoter) cloned in both direct and reversed orientations exhibited a 4–6-fold increase of luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). The observed differences were statistically significant (p< 0.05). Other constructs had no effect on the level of luciferase in IL-2-stimulated cells (data not shown). Our results suggested the presence of a functional IL-2-inducible element within 537 bpClaI–TthIII DNA fragment (bp −1429 to −892 relative to the P2 promoter). The EMSA was used to analyze protein-DNA interactions within this putative 537-bp, cis-acting, IL-2-inducible regulatory domain. The end-labeled 537-bpClaI–TthIII fragment was incubated with nuclear extracts from untreated and IL-2-stimulated cells and analyzed on nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 1 C, only nuclear extracts from IL-2-stimulated cells form a slowly migrating DNA-protein complex. This protein-DNA complex was eliminated when a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled fragment was included in the binding reaction. Cold competitors of unrelated sequence had no effect (not shown). To narrow the position of this protein-binding site within theClaI–TthIII fragment, we used the stairway assay (a modification of standard EMSA for localization of protein/DNA-binding sites in large DNA segments with known sequence). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” we prepared two 537-bp probes, labeled only on a single 5′ terminus (eitherClaI or TthIII end). Fig.2 A presents the way each of the probes was subsequently shortened by restriction endonucleasesHpaI, KpnI, HaeII, BsrI, and ApaI. After cleavage, each probe contained two fragments with only one 32P-labeled. Only complexes between nuclear proteins and the 32P-labeled portion could be visualized in EMSA assays. As shown in Fig. 2 B, ClaI end-labeled full-length probe and all fragments, generated by restriction from this probe, were able to generate similar DNA-protein complexes. The ability of the shortest ClaI end-labeled fragment (lane 16,ClaI–HpaI fragment) to form a complex with nuclear proteins from IL-2-stimulated cells suggests the presence of the protein-binding site within this 100-bp fragment. In the case of the TthIII end-labeled fragment, we observed DNA-protein complexes only when the full-length probe was used (lane 5a). Shortening of the probe by 100 bp (lane 6a, cleavage with HpaI) eliminated the band of slowly migrating complex. These data map the position of the protein-binding site within the 100-bp DNA fragment (−1429 to −1329 bp relative to the P2 promoter). To examine whether this shortened DNA fragment (ClaI–HpaI) contains the same enhancer element(s) responsive to IL-2 activation and is acting in the same manner as the full-length 537-bp probe, a 100-bp fragment was cloned into the pGL3-promoter luciferase reporter construct, and transient transfections were carried out, as described previously. As shown in Fig. 3 A, insertion of theClaI–HpaI fragment in any orientation (forward or reverse) did not activate this reporter in the absence of IL-2. IL-2 induction led to a 12–15-fold increase in luciferase activity using both constructs pGL3/100(+) and pGL3/100(−). These data are statistically significant (p = 0.05). Comparison of luciferase transcriptional assays performed with reporter constructs containing the 537-bp insert (Fig. 1 B) and the 100-bp insert (Fig. 3 A) revealed that the smaller insert induced higher levels of transcriptional activation than the larger one. This suggests that replacement of DNA sequence ClaI–TthIII in the reporter gene construct with the smallerClaI–HpaI fragment eliminated additional negative effects of other regulatory elements in this portion of the c-myc 5′-flanking region. To confirm the ability of the 100-bp fragment to form the same type of DNA-protein complex as the 537-bp fragment, we performed another EMSA experiment using both fragments as probes. Incubation of each of these probes with nuclear extracts from IL-2-stimulated cells leads to formation of specific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3 and 6). The remainder of the 537-bp probe (HpaI–TthIII, 400-bp fragment) was unable to bind nuclear proteins from IL-2-stimulated cells (data not shown). To locate the position of the protein-binding site within the 100-bp fragment, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.4, only nuclear extracts from IL-2-stimulated cells were able to generate the DNase I-protected region in the 100-bp fragment (lane 7). Using densitometry and PhosphorImager analysis, we found at least 70% reduction of the bands' intensity in the protected region (marked with the arrows) while compared with the bands' intensity outside this area. The arrows indicate the position of the 20-bp protected sequence 5′-GCATTTCCAATAATAAAAGG-3′ (−1406 to −1387 relative to P2 promoter). Based on this sequence, a 20-bp probe was generated for EMSA experiments. Fig. 5presents the results of EMSA and competition experiments with 20- and 100-bp fragments. First, the 20-bp probe was able to generate complexes with nuclear extracts from IL-2-stimulated cells (lane 11, marked with the arrows). Minor complexes, other than those indicated by arrows, were not reproducibly induced by IL-2 in multiple experiments and thus should be disregarded. Second, the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled 20-bp fragment removed the complexes formed between nuclear proteins of stimulated cells and the 100-bp fragment (lane 8). Third, the presence of a 100-fold excess of cold 100-bp probe eliminated 82% (determined by densitometry) of the complexes, formed by the 20-bp fragment and nuclear proteins (lane 13). Collectively, these results provide evidence of identical protein-binding sites in both fragments.Figure 5Cold competitors decrease the formation of32P-DNA-protein complexes in EMSA. EMSA with NE from nonstimulated (lanes 2, 6, and10) and IL-2-stimulated (lanes 3,4, 7, 8, and 11–13) NK3.3 cells was performed for the 100-bp ClaI–HpaI32P-labeled fragment (lanes 1–8) and 20-bp double-stranded synthetic 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (lanes 9–13). For each binding reaction 10 μg of total NE protein and 1 ng of the corresponding probe were taken.Lanes 1, 5, and 9 have probes only, no NE. For the cold competition, binding was performed in the presence of a 100-fold excess (100 ng) of unlabeled 100-bp fragment (lanes 4 and 13) or 20-bp fragment (lanes 8 and 12).

Mutational analysis revealed unexpected affinity for IL-5 receptor α chain with variants containing E110W or E110Y. Escherichia coli-expressed Glu110variants containing E110W in the otherwise sequence-intact N-terminal half, including a variant with an E110A replacement in the sequence-disabled C-terminal half, were shown by their CD spectra to be folded into secondary structures similar to that of single chain human IL-5 (scIL-5). Biosensor kinetics analysis revealed that (E110W/A5)scIL-5 and (E110W/A6)scIL-5 had receptor α chain binding affinities similar to that of (wt/A5)scIL-5. However, (E110W/A6)scIL-5 had a significantly reduced bioactivity in TF-1 cell proliferation compared with both (wt/A5)scIL-5 and (E110W/A5)scIL-5, and this activity reduction was disproportionately greater than the much smaller effect of Glu110 mutation on receptor binding affinity. The marked and disproportionate decrease in TF-1proliferation observed with (E110W/A6)scIL-5 suggests a role for Glu110 in the biological activity mediated by the signal transducing receptor βc subunit of the IL-5 receptor. This is also consistent with the lack of stimulation of JAK2phosphorylation by the (E110W/A6)scIL-5 mutant in recombinant 293T cells, as compared with the concentration-dependent stimulation seen for scIL-5. The results reveal the dispensability of charge in the Glu110 locus of IL-5 for receptor α chain binding and, in contrast, its heretofore underappreciated importance for receptor activation.

IL-5 exerts its biological functions through binding to a heteromeric cell surface receptor composed of two types of subunit, α and βc, each containing a glycosylated extracellular domain with repeating fibronectin-like sequences, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The α chain is IL-5-specific, although structurally related to the α chains for GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors. The βc chain is identical to the β chains of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptors (4.Tavernier J.

Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). However, direct binding of IL-5 to βc alone has never been quantitated. The βc subunit is essential for signaling. IL-5 is a member of a broad family of structurally related cytokines that contain a helical bundle core (10.Nicola N.A. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the IL-5 dimer shows it is composed of a pair of four-helix bundles (11.Milburn M.V. Hassell A.M. Lambert M.H. Jordan S.R. Proudfoot A.E.I. Graber P. Wells T.N.C.

In IL-5, helix D of one polypeptide chain combines with helices A, B, and C of a second, identical chain by domain swapping (19.Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) to form the stable dimer. Understanding of the IL-5 receptor activation process is still incomplete but is advancing. A growing body of evidence suggests that helices A (residues 11–31) and D (residues 93–118) of IL-5 both contribute important components to receptor binding. Evidence obtained in our own work by site-directed mutagenesis (20.Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence for involvement of the IL-5 A helix in recruiting βc has been obtained with a chimeric protein containing an N-terminal segment (residues 5–29) of mouse IL-5 and the remaining sequence from human GM-CSF (25.Shanafelt A.B. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Kastelein R.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4105-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A role for Glu13 of the A helix in biological activity but not α chain interaction has been shown by mutagenesis of wild type IL-5 (23.Tavernier J. Tuypens A.V. Plaetinck R.D. Heyden J.V. Cuisez Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Glu13 of IL-5 is analogous to the functionally important Glu22 in IL-3 and Glu21 in GM-CSF. This is consistent with a role of Glu13 in βc chain interaction. The CD loop and Glu110 compose an epitope around the four-helix bundle interface of the IL-5 cylinder, whereas the Glu13 residues are at the distal ends of the cylinder (Fig. 1). A view has arisen in which receptor α chain recruitment occurs around the four-helix bundle interface, whereas βcrecruitment leading to signaling occurs at the distal ends (26.Chaiken I.M. Proudfoot A. Sanderson C. IL5: From Molecule to Drug Target for Asthma. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 167-188Google Scholar). Although site-directed mutagenesis studies have identified important residues for receptor recruitment and activation, the one-residue-at-a-time substitution allowed by this technique limits a full mechanistic understanding of what specific structural and electrostatic features of the IL-5 surface are required for receptor binding. Such understanding can be obtained more completely by examining the replaceability of individual side chains, or sets of side chains, by all other side chain types, in other words by examining libraries of sequences containing all possible side chains in local regions of the surface and determining which combinations allow productive binding. Such random epitope mutagenesis can be achieved with sequence libraries formed by phage display. This technique has been applied successfully to in vitro antibody maturation and protein engineering (27.Clackson T. Wells J.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1994; 12: 173-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Typically a foreign gene is fused in frame with phage coat protein pIII encoded by a phagemid vector. The surface displayed recombinant foreign protein can be selected by affinity selection procedures (biopanning). Human growth hormone has been displayed on phage and higher receptor affinity variants selected through random mutagenesis and phage panning (28.Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A,. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We have displayed scIL-5 on phage using a two-stage construction that now allows asymmetric randomization mutagenesis of the IL-5 molecule and therefrom a deeper understanding of the IL-5-receptor recognition process (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An asymmetrically disabled but functional scIL-5 mutant was displayed on phage. This mutant was constructed of an N-terminal half containing the original five charged residues (88EERRR92) in the CD loop combined with a C-terminal half containing a disabling CD loop sequence (88AAAAA92) in which the charged side chains of both Glu89 and Arg91 (identified by site-directed mutagenesis as important for α chain recruitment) are replaced. This asymmetrically disabled variant was used as a starting point to generate an asymmetric scIL-5 library in which the 88–92-residue N-terminal CD loop was randomized to identify functional IL-5 variants. From this epitope library, a receptor-binding variant of IL-5 was selected in which the only charged residue in the CD loop is Arg90. The results obtained argue that the key receptor recognition element in the CD loop is an Arg residue, that the position of this charged residue may be mutable within the loop from its position in wild type IL-5, that the CD loop can be simplified in considering design of structure-based mimetics, and that phage display has utility to examine the IL-5 receptor recruitment mechanism. Based on these epitope randomization results, we have now used the sequence randomization approach to examine the third residue in the putative IL-5Rα recruitment epitope of IL-5, namely Glu110. Mutational analysis of Glu110 in phage displayed, asymmetrically disabled scIL-5 showed unexpectedly that residue replacements that enabled retention of IL-5R α binding included Trp and Tyr. The substantial binding efficacy upon E110W mutation was verified with purified, Escherichia coli-expressed mutated proteins. In contrast, depletion of both negative charges at residue 110 led to a major reduction in cell proliferation and JAK2 phosphorylation activity. The results of this work show that the Glu110 negatively charged locus is important for receptor activation, although it is dispensible for α chain binding, that the negative charge of Glu110 can aid activation either within its four-helix bundle domain or through cross-domain cooperativity, and that charge-depleting mutations at Glu110 may help lead to IL-5 antagonists that bind α chain but do not induce receptor activation. We consider two mechanistic possibilities by which Glu110 may function in receptor activation, including its direct involvement in βc contact or alternatively its more indirect impact on βc recruitment via the mode of α chain binding that it helps to effect. The phagemid vector, pMK-wt/A5-G3 (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was used as a starting point to prepare different Glu110 mutants. Two working vectors, pCR-IL-5A and pCR-IL-5B encoding one copy of IL-5 sequence, have been used for asymmetric mutation as reported previously (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To generate mutations in Glu110 position, the codon of Glu110 in pCR-IL-5A was mutated to 19 other amino acids using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The combination of mutated Glu110 in the N-terminal half and a wild type Glu110 in the C-terminal half of scIL-5 yielded an asymmetric mutant phagemid, designated pMK-E110X/A5-G3.X represents all residues with the exception of glutamic acid. The resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli XL1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) harboring pMK-E110X/A5-G3 or pMK-scIL-5-G3 were grown overnight in 100 ml of super broth medium in the presence of M13 VCS helper phage (Stratagene). Phage pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer as described (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phage titers, defined as carbenicillin-resistant colony-forming units/ml (cfu/ml), were determined according to Zhong and Smith (30.Zhong G. Smith G.P. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 838-839PubMed Google Scholar). PRO-BIND ELISA plates (Falcon) were coated with 100 μl (10 mg/ml) of shIL-5Rα-Fc (31.Li J. Cook R. Hensley P. Doyle M. McNulty D. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6694-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein-charged ELISA plates were incubated with 100 μl of phage samples in PBS buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, and the wells then were washed with PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20. Phage binding was detected with a 1:2500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-M13 IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and color development with 3,3′,5,5′-tetra-methyl-benzidine dihydrochloride. This reagent was dissolved in 0.05 mphosphate-citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% sodium perborate (Sigma). The reaction was measured by the absorbance at 450 nm. Null phage, which did not carry any insert, was used as background control. Competitive phage ELISA on microtiter plates coated with shIL-5Rα-Fc (20 μg/ml) were performed to confirm the relative receptor binding affinities of different phage selectants. The experiments were carried out according to Jones et al. (32.Jones J.T. Ballinger M.D. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11667-11674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A concentration of phage sample, predetermined to elicit 60% signal in titration assays, was incubated with different concentrations of soluble IL-5Rα, ranging from 0 to 100 nm. These phage mixtures were then added to the shIL-5Rα-Fc-coated microwells. Following incubation, microtiter plates were washed thoroughly, and bound phage were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phage antibody (1:900 dilution). EC50 values were determined by fit to a four-parameter equation to determine the concentration of competing shIL-5Rα that resulted in half-maximal phage binding. The phagemid vector pHage 3, which is derived from M13, was used for protein expression (Maxim Biotech, Inc., San Francisco, CA). Transcription was under the control of thelac promoter. This vector contains an Amber stop codon before Gene III. The scIL-5 or Glu110 mutant genes were amplified using polymerase chain reaction, with primers that also introduced mutations to the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites, converting them to SalI andApaI, respectively. The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was digested with SalI/ApaI and ligated into the SalI/ApaI sites of pHage 3 phage vector, yielding pH3-(E110X/A5)scIL-5. The mutant plasmid was electroporated into TOPP3 cells (Stratagene). The recombinant cells were grown in super broth medium and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside as described previously (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The lysate supernatant from the induced culture was dialyzed against PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and then loaded onto two monoclonal anti-IL-5 affinity columns (in series) equilibrated in PBS buffer. The two affinity columns were packed with mAb 2E3-Sepharose 4B matrix and mAb 4A6-Sepharose 4B matrix, respectively. The 2E3 mAb is a neutralizing antibody that blocks IL-5 interaction with the α chain of the IL-5 receptor complex (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33.Ames R. Tornetta M. McMillan L. Kaiser K. Holmes S. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D. Theisen T. Gross M. Jones C. Silverman C. Porter T. Cook R. Bennett D. Chaiken I. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6355-6364PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, 4A6 mAb is an activity-neutralizing antibody whose exact binding epitope is presently unknown but that does not block IL-5 interaction with receptor α chain (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The final yield of scIL-5 and Glu110 mutants was analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) according to Laemmli (34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar). Kinetic and equilibrium constants for the interaction between hIL-5Rα and E. coli-expressed scIL-5 or Glu110 mutants were measured using a BIACORE Xoptical biosensor (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The monoclonal antibody 4A6 was first immobilized onto the biosensor chip (31.Li J. Cook R. Hensley P. Doyle M. McNulty D. Chaiken I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6694-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The expressed scIL-5 or Glu110 variants from bacterial supernatants were anchored noncovalently to the antibody. The binding of various concentrations of soluble hIL-5Rα-Fc (12.Johanson K. Appelbaum E. Doyle M. Hensley P. Zhao B. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Young P. Cook R. Carr S. Matico R., . Cusimano D. Dul E. Angelichio M. Brooks I. Winborne E. McDonnell P. Morton T. Bennett D. Sokoloski T. McNulty D. Rosenberg M. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9459-9471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to the antibody-anchored scIL-5 or mutant protein was then measured. Alternatively, soluble hIL5Rα-Fc was directly immobilized on the sensor chips, and scIL-5 variants were used as analytes. Conditions for immobilization and the sensor assay were the same as those described by Morton et al. (20.Morton T. Li J. Cook R. Chaiken I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10879-10883Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For the calculation of rate constants, the association and dissociation phases of sensorgrams obtained for a series of soluble hIL-5Rα-Fc or scIL-5 variant at different concentrations were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir model, A+B ↔ AB, to yield, respectively, an association rate constantk on and a dissociation rate constantk off. Data analysis was conducted using the BIAcore evaluation software version 3.0. The equilibrium dissociation constant, K d, was determined from ratios ofk off/k on (35.Morton T. Bennett D.B. Appelbaum E.R. Cusimano D.M. Johanson K.O. Matico R.E. Young P.R. Doyle M. Chaiken I.M. J. Mol. Recog. 1994; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Biological activity was measured using a subclone of a highly responsive subclone of the human erythroleukemia cell line TF-1 (21.Li J. Cook R. Dede K. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1817-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and an assay with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Thiazolyl blue Sigma) assay (36.Monfardini C.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% heat-treated fetal calf serum (Life Techniques, Inc.). Plates with 96 flat-bottomed wells were seeded with 5000 cells/well and incubated for 48 h in triplicate in the presence of serially diluted wtIL-5 or IL-5 mutant proteins. Then, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide in 1× PBS was added per well, and after 5 h 100 μl of 10% SDS in 0.01 n HCl was added to solubilize the precipitated crystals. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, A-570 nm was detected. Concentrations of E. coli-expressed scIL-5 or mutant proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and by quantitative IL-5 ELISA using the monoclonal antibodies 4A6 and TRFK-5 (R & D Systems). Measurements were made on an Aviv 62A DS Circular Dichroism Spectrometer in a 0.1-cm water-jacketed cuvette. Solution conditions were 10 μm protein (pH 7.4), 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 150 mm NaCl at 25 °C. Spectra shown are the averages of three scan runs at 24 nm/min with a 5-s response time. Thermal stabilities of scIL-5 constructs were evaluated by monitoring the ellipticity at 222 nm. Temperature was increased in each case at a rate of 30 °C/h. 293T cells were a gift from Martin Carroll (Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pennsylvania). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum. Cloning of the cDNA for IL-5Rα was performed as described (37.Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Wilson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G. Kile B.J. Kent S.B. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2071-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The βc chain clone was provided by Dr. Richard Cook (SmithKline Beecham). The full-length IL-5 receptor α was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS-CS (a gift from Dr. Jerry Langer, Rutgers University). The common β chain was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDEF (provided by Dr. Jerry Langer). HumanJAK2 cDNA was provided by Dr. Chaim Roifman (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) and was cloned into the expression vector pCDNA3. 293T cells (2 × 108) were transfected for 6 h with 160 μg each of IL5Rα, βc, and hJAK2 DNA samples by using CaPO4 method. After 48 h, cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry for receptor expression. Cell aliquots (1 × 107 transfected 293T cells) were stimulated for 2 min with scIL-5, Glu110 mutants, or without cytokine at 37 °C. Cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium desoxycholate, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-JAK2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoblots were visualized by using the ECL detection system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total cell lysates from transfected 293T cells were also analyzed by immunoblot using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. The two glutamic acid 110 residues in the IL-5 dimer form a negatively charged patch on the surface of the cytokine (Fig.1) and have been proposed from previous Ala replacement mutagenesis studies to be a key part of the pharmacophore for receptor α chain binding that also has been proposed to include Glu89 and Arg91. Recent sequence randomization study of the CD loop region of IL-5 (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) has led to a significant reevaluation of how Glu89 and Arg91 participate in α chain binding. The current study was undertaken to more deeply understand the role of Glu110through a similar randomization approach. To perform a rapid and efficient randomization of Glu110 in the N-terminal domain of (wt/A5)scIL-5, an asymmetric construct reported previously (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20479-20488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we combined site-directed mutagenesis and phage display technology to screen the IL-5 receptor α chain binding ability. Phage particles displaying Glu110 scIL-5 variants were detected by mAb 4A6 immobilized on microtiter plates (29.Wu S.-J. Li J. Tsui P. Cook R. Zhang W. Hu Y. Canziani G. Chaiken I. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2024967913,"J2E cells produce rapid, fatal erythroleukemias in vivo but still respond to erythropoietin (epo) in vitro by differentiating, proliferating and remaining viable in the absence of serum. Mutant epo receptors were introduced into these cells to determine whether they could influence the different biological responses to epo in vitro and the development of erythroleukemias. Three mutant receptors were used as cytoplasmic truncation mutants Delta257 and Delta321 (above box 1 and below box 2 respectively), and the cytoplasmic point mutant W282R (defective for JAK2 activation). Strikingly, the Delta321 mutation produced a hyper-sensitive response in vitro to epo-induced differentiation and viability, but not to proliferation. In contrast with the Delta321 receptor, the Delta257 and W282R mutants inhibited all biological responses to epo due to impaired JAK2 phosphorylation. Significantly, erythroleukemias took almost twice as long to develop with cells containing the W282R mutation, indicating that JAK2 plays an important role in the emergence of these leukemias. These data demonstrate that mutant epo receptors dominantly altered responses of J2E cells to epo in culture and the development of erythroleukemias. Oncogene (2000) 19, 953 - 960."
