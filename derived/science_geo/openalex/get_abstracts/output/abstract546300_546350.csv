https://openalex.org/W2175337105,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been modified by β and γ-secretase that cause amyloid deposits (plaques) in neuronal cells. Glyceraldhyde-derived AGEs has been identified as a major source of neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a previous study, we demonstrated that glyceraldehyde-derived AGEs increase APP and Aβ via ROS. Furthermore, the combination of AGEs and Aβ has been shown to enhance neurotoxicity. In mice, APP expression is increased by tail vein injection of AGEs. This evidence suggests a correlation between AGEs and the development of AD. However, the role played by AGEs in the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that AGEs up-regulate APP processing protein (BACE and PS1) and Sirt1 expression via ROS, but do not affect the expression of downstream antioxidant genes HO-1 and NQO-1. Moreover, we found that AGEs increase GRP78 expression and enhance the cell death-related pathway p53, bcl-2/bax ratio, caspase 3. These results indicate that AGEs impair the neuroprotective effects of Sirt1 and lead to neuronal cell death via ER stress. Our findings suggest that AGEs increase ROS production, which stimulates downstream pathways related to APP processing, Aβ production, Sirt1, and GRP78, resulting in the up-regulation of cell death related pathway. This in-turn enhances neuronal cell death, which leads to the development of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2172380717,"The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is well known for its immune modulatory role. However, recent localisation of CB2 receptors in metabolically active tissue suggests that the CB2 receptor plays a significant role in energy homeostasis. This study was designed to investigate the impact of chronic CB2 receptor stimulation on food intake, body weight and mood. Lean male C57BL/6 mice were injected i.p. with the selective CB2 receptor agonist, JWH-015 (0.0, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) to establish dose response parameters. Mice made obese following exposure to a diet consisting of 19.4 MJ/kg (4641 Kcal/kg) of energy (19.0% protein, 21.0% total fat, 4.7% crude fiber, and 4.7% AD fiber were given either vehicle or 10 mg/kg JWH-015. Impact on mood, food intake, body weight, plasma metabolites, expression of key metabolic proteins in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), and markers of inflammation were measured. High dose (10 mg/kg) JWH-015 reduced food intake after 1, 2, 4, and 24 h in lean mice. When given to diet induced obese (DIO) mice, a 10 mg/kg dose of JWH-015 significantly reduced body weight compared to vehicle. This dose led to a shift in markers of lipid metabolism and inflammation in WAT consistent with lipolysis and improved immune response. Furthermore, JWH-015 (10 mg/kg) produced a transient reduction in food intake and significant reduction in fat mass and adipocyte cell size. Importantly, JWH-015 produced an anxiolytic response in the elevated plus maze while having no effect on immobility time in the forced swim test. It should be noted that though the 10 mg/kg dose produced positive effects on the obese state, the possibility that these effects are mediated via non-CB2 receptor mechanisms cannot be ruled out. These results demonstrate a role for CB2 receptors in modulating energy homeostasis and obesity associated metabolic pathologies in the absence of any adverse impact on mood."
https://openalex.org/W2219398214,"Maternal and child under nutrition is highly prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, resulting in substantial increases in mortality and overall disease burden. The aim of this baseline survey was to determine the association between selected maternal characteristics, maternal nutritional status and children's nutritional status.A survey with a cross sectional design was conducted between September and October 2012 in Hula, Ethiopia. The study subjects were 197 mothers of children between the ages of 6 and 23 months. Weight and height (mothers) or recumbent length (children) were measured using calibrated, standardized techniques. Seven percent of children were below -2 weight for height Z score (WHZ), 11.5% were below -2 height for age Z score (HAZ) and 9.9% were below -2 weight for age Z score (WAZ). Maternal anthropometrics were associated with child nutritional status in the bivariate analysis. Maternal BMI (r = 0.16 P = 0.02) and educational status (r = 0.25 P = 0.001) were correlated with WHZ of children while maternal height (r = 0.2 P = 0.007) was correlated with HAZ of children. After multivariate analysis, children whose mothers had salary from employment had a better WHZ score (P = 0.001) and WAZ score (P<0.001). Both maternal BMI and maternal height were associated with WHZ (P = 0.04) and HAZ (P = 0.01) score of children.Having a mother with better nutritional status and salaried employment is a benefit for the nutritional status of the child. The interrelationship between maternal and child nutritional status stresses the value of improving maternal nutritional status as this should improve both maternal and child health outcomes. Therefore strategies to improve nutritional status of children should also include improving the nutritional status of the mother and empowering her financially."
https://openalex.org/W2179716432,"Head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) is the 7th most common cancer worldwide. Despite the development of new therapeutic agents such as monoclonal antibodies, prognosis did not change for the last decades. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) presents the most promising new technology in cancer treatment. In this study the efficacy of a surface micro discharging (SMD) plasma device against two head and neck cancer cell lines was proved. Effects on the cell viability, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis induction were evaluated with the MTT assay, alkaline microgel electrophoresis (comet assay) and Annexin-V/PI staining. MTT assay revealed that the CAP treatment markedly decreases the cell viability for all tested treatment times (30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 s). IC 50 was reached within maximal 120 seconds of CAP treatment. Comet assay analysis showed a dose dependent high DNA fragmentation being one of the key players in anti-cancer activity of CAP. Annexin-V/PI staining revealed induction of apoptosis in CAP treated HNSCC cell lines but no significant dose dependency was seen. Thus, we confirmed that SMD Plasma technology is definitely a promising new approach on cancer treatment."

Mastitis is a major impediment for milk production, but not much information is available about bubaline mastitis, especially subclinical mastitis. The aim of this study was to (a) investigate the application of various tests for the diagnosis of bubaline subclinical mastitis, (b) identify the major bacteria associated with it, and (c) evaluate the antibiotic resistance pattern of the bacteria. To this end, 190 quarter milk samples were collected from 57 domesticated dairy buffaloes from organized (64 samples) and unorganized (126 samples) sectors. Of these, 48.4%, 40.0%, 45.8%, 61.1%, and 61.6% were positive for subclinical mastitis by somatic cell count, electrical conductivity, California mastitis test, bromothymol blue test, and N-acetyl glucosaminidase test, respectively. As compared to the gold standard of somatic cell count, California mastitis test performed the best. However, a combination of the two methods was found to be the best option. Microbiological evaluation, both by biochemical methods as well as by monoplex and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, revealed that coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most predominant (64.8%) bacteria, followed by streptococci (18.1%), Escherichia coli (9.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.3%). Most of the pathogens were resistant to multiple antibiotics, especially to β-lactam antibiotics. We propose that California mastitis test be combined with somatic cell count for diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in domestic dairy buffaloes. Further, our results reveal high resistance of the associated bacteria to the β-lactam class of antibiotics, and a possible major role of coagulase-negative staphylococci in causing the disease in India."
https://openalex.org/W2176392834,"Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection caused by the vaginotropic extracellular protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. The infection is recurrent, with no lasting immunity, often asymptomatic, and linked to pregnancy complications and risk of viral infection. The molecular mechanisms of immune evasion by the parasite are poorly understood. We demonstrate that galectin-1 and -3 are expressed by the human cervical and vaginal epithelial cells and act as pathogen-recognition receptors for the ceramide phosphoinositol glycan core (CPI-GC) of the dominant surface protozoan lipophosphoglycan (LPG). We used an in vitro model with siRNA galectin knockdown epithelial clones, recombinant galectins, clinical Trichomonas isolates, and mutant protozoan derivatives to dissect the function of galectin-1 and -3 in the context of Trichomonas infection. Galectin-1 suppressed chemokines that facilitate recruitment of phagocytes, which can eliminate extracellular protozoa (IL-8) or bridge innate to adaptive immunity (MIP-3α and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)). Silencing galectin-1 increased and adding exogenous galectin-1 suppressed chemokine responses to Trichomonas or CPI-GC/LPG. In contrast, silencing galectin-3 reduced IL-8 response to LPG. Live Trichomonas depleted the extracellular levels of galectin-3. Clinical isolates and mutant Trichomonas CPI-GC that had reduced affinity to galectin-3 but maintained affinity to galectin-1 suppressed chemokine expression. Thus via CPI-GC binding, Trichomonas is capable of regulating galectin bioavailability and function to the benefit of its parasitic survival. These findings suggest novel approaches to control trichomoniasis and warrant further studies of galectin-binding diversity among clinical isolates as a possible source for symptom disparity in parasitic infections.

Each year over 180 million people become infected with the genitourinary protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, which steadily accounts for over half of the sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 2The abbreviations used are: STI, sexually transmitted infection; CPI-CG, ceramide phosphoinositol glycan core; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; polyLacNAc; poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ANOVA, analysis of variance; m, mutant; rh, recombinant human; LEA, L. esculentum agglutinin. worldwide (1World Health Organization Global incidence and prevalence of selected curable sexually transmitted infections-2008.in: World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2012Google Scholar) and for significant public health burdens, including low birth weight and prematurity, cervical and prostate cancer, and risk of HIV infection (2Fichorova R.N. Impact of T. vaginalis infection on innate immune responses and reproductive outcome.J. Reprod. Immunol. 2009; 83: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the United States, unlike other less common STIs, such as chlamydiasis, gonorrhea, and syphilis, trichomoniasis is not a reportable disease, and no prophylactic annual screening for T. vaginalis has been implemented. At the same time, the lack of symptoms in at least half of the diagnosed cases in women and even more in men suggests that in the absence of preventive screening most infections may remain undiagnosed and untreated. It is unclear how the protozoan parasite evades the immune system to allow for often silent, lasting, and recurrent infections. The parasite is best adapted to extracellular colonization of the human cervico-vaginal mucosa, and therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms of the epithelial surface host-pathogen interactions in the human female genital tract is essential for building successful future eradication strategies. It is known that parasitic protozoa contain a variety of complex carbohydrates on their surfaces, e.g. glycolipids, glycoproteins, and glycosylated phosphatidylinositol glycolipids (3Nyame A.K. Kawar Z.S. Cummings R.D. Antigenic glycans in parasitic infections: implications for vaccines and diagnostics.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 182-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These glycoconjugates have been reported to play important roles in host cell invasion and evasion of host immune responses (4Turco S.J. Descoteaux A.

T. vaginalis and the related bovine parasite Tritrichomonas foetus express lipophosphoglycans (LPG) at several million copies per parasite anchored on the protozoan surface via an inositol phosphoceramide (7Singh B.N.

The ceramide phosphoinositol glycan core (CPI-GC) of LPG also cooperates with pathogenic vaginal bacteria and with its own microflora, endobiont dsRNA T. vaginalis virus, to alter bacterial colonization patterns and the local immune environment in support of bacterial vaginosis, which in turn facilitates T. vaginalis survival (9Fichorova R.N.

The T. vaginalis LPG and its immunocompetent CPI-GC domain contain β-galactosides and abundant poly-N-acetyl-lactosamine repeats (polyLacNAc) (12Singh B.N. Hayes G.R. Lucas J.J. Sommer U. Viseux N.

Furthermore, it has been reported that galectin-1 mediates the adherence of the parasite to cervical epithelial cells in an LPG-dependent manner; however, the effects of this binding on host immunity, as well as the molecular interactions of LPG and galectin-1, remained unexplored (17Okumura C.Y.

Microbiol. 2008; 10: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We focused our studies on galectin-1 and -3 because these two galectins have shown important effects on immune cells, including phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells (18Rabinovich G.A. Gruppi A.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to identify the molecular domain on the T. vaginalis surface responsible for functional galectin binding that manipulates host immunity. T. vaginalis isolates were obtained with informed consent under IRB-approved protocol from women attending the Onondaga County Health Department STI Clinic (OC isolates) and the University Hospital Microbiology/Clinical Pathology Lab, State University of New York Upstate Medical University (UH isolates), Syracuse, NY, and the University of Rochester (the UR1 isolate) STI Clinic, Rochester, NY, as described previously(11Fichorova R.N.

T. vaginalis wild type B7RC2 (WT) and mutants 4.12 and 2E2 were obtained from Patricia Johnson. The status of the T. vaginalis virus infection of each isolate was determined as described and reported (11Fichorova R.N. Lee Y. Yamamoto H.S. Takagi Y. Hayes G.R. Goodman R.P. Chepa-Lotrea X.

All Trichomonas isolates were cultured in modified Diamond's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HyClone Laboratory) and iron, as reported earlier (20Gilbert R.O. Elia G. Beach D.H. Klaessig S. Singh B.N. Cytopathogenic effect of Trichomonas vaginalis on human vaginal epithelial cells cultured in vitro.Infect.

Lipophosphoglycan-like glycoconjugate of Trichomonas foetus and Trichomonas vaginalis.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 57: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The CPI-GC core was released by mild acid hydrolysis (100 mm TFA containing 1 μg/ml DTT) and purified on a C18 Sep-Pak column. The molecular purity of the LPG and CPI-GC preparations was confirmed by mass spectrometry as described (12Singh B.N. Hayes G.R. Lucas J.J. Sommer U. Viseux N. Mirgorodskaya E. Trifonova R.T.

J. 2009; 26: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of endotoxin contamination of each preparation was confirmed by the EndoSafe Test System (Charles River Laboratories, Charleston, SC) based on the Limulus amoebocyte lysate test with sensitivity <0.05 EU/ml (12Singh B.N.

Monosaccharide composition of CPI-GC was determined by strong acid hydrolysis followed by high performance anion exchange chromatography. Samples (100 μg) were hydrolyzed in 4 m TFA at 125 °C for 1 h and dried under vacuum. An aliquot in water was applied to a CarboPac PA1 column (4 × 250 mm) equilibrated in 8 mm NaOH, and monosaccharides were eluted with water. Monosaccharides were detected by pulsed amperometry. In some experiments the column was equilibrated in 6 mm NaOH. For the epithelial culture experiments, we used recombinant human (rh) galectin-1 and -3 generated and purified as described by Sato and co-workers (21Bhaumik P. St-Pierre G. Milot V. St-Pierre C.

Purified galectin solution was passed through an ActiClean Etox (Sterogen) column to ensure that the endotoxin level was less than 10 EU/mg. For Western blot experiments, we used rh-galectin-1 courtesy of Dr. Richard Cummings (Emory University). Prior to each experiment, lactose and mercaptoethanol were removed from this galectin-1 preparation by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P6. For solid phase binding assays of T. vaginalis, LPG, and CPI-GC and for galectin-1 and -3 ELISA and electrochemiluminescence assays, we used rh-galectin-1 and -3 purchased from R&D Systems. Goat polyclonal anti-galectin-1 antibody and three monoclonal antibodies against galectin-3 were obtained from R&D Systems. We confirmed by Western blot analysis using Mac2 antibody as a well established control that all monoclonal antibodies were directed against the N-terminal (non-lectin) domain of galectin-3 and did not bind the CRD domain (Fig. 2E). Biotinylated CPI-GC or LPG was prepared using Pierce EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit as directed by the manufacturer. Bio-layer interferometry was performed on a ForteBio Octet Red (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA). Streptavidin-coated biosensors were pre-wet in PBS and loaded for 30–60 min in a solution of 50 μg/ml biotinylated CPI-GC. Following a brief wash at pH 3.0 to remove loosely associated lipid, baseline was established by incubation for 5 min in PBS followed by incubation with varying concentrations of lectins or galectins in PBS for 1 h. Dissociation was then examined by incubation for an additional hour in PBS. All steps were performed at 25 °C and at 1000 rpm (except for the loading step, which was done at 0 rpm). For galectin-3, binding was performed in PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20. Steady-state analysis was performed using the ForteBio Data Analysis software (version 6.3). Ricin and tomato lectin were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). The experimental procedure to examine the binding of galectin-1 and galectin-3 to T. vaginalis parasites was similar to that described for Leishmania (25Pelletier I. Hashidate T. Urashima T. Nishi N.

For galectin-1 binding, T. vaginalis parasites (2 × 107) were incubated with purified recombinant galectin-1 (∼25 μg) in 250 μl of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm Hepes/PBS (1:1 ratio) in the presence and absence of lactose (100–200 mm), at 4 °C for 30 min. The concentration of NaCl in PBS was manipulated to maintain appropriate osmolarity when parasites were incubated with 100–200 mm sugar. Also, a protease inhibitor mixture was added during each incubation period to inhibit cleavage of galectin-1. Following the incubation, parasite-free supernatants were obtained by centrifugation at 4 °C at 6500 rpm for 10 min. The parasites were washed once with PBS to remove unbound galectin, then resuspended in PBS at 4 °C, followed by release of galectin-1 bound to parasites with 100 mm lactose. The supernatants of each incubation mixture were concentrated using Centricon YM-3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (20%), followed by Western blot analysis. Galectin-3 binding was performed in a similar manner. Whole parasites at 3.5 × 105/well fixed in 5% formalin and purified LPG or CPI-GC (0.3–5 μg, 25 μl of 80% ethanol) were added to each well of 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Corning Costar®-CARBO-BIND) and allowed to bind at room temperature for 12–18 h. The wells were washed with PBS three times and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h. After washing the wells with PBS, galectin-1 (4 μg/well) or galectin-3 (3 μg/well) in PBS was added to each well in the absence and presence of a competing sugar (lactose) (100 mm) or a non-competing sugar (raffinose or sucrose) (100 mm) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed with PBS and incubated with galectin-1 and galectin-3 antibody (25 ng/well) in PBS for 2 h. After washing with PBS and three more times with PBS/Tween (0.05%), the plates were incubated with HRP-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (dilution 1:1000 in PBS-T) for 2 h. SureBlue® TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added to each well after a PBS/Tween wash.

https://openalex.org/W2270990504,"We established a laboratory clonal strain of freshwater planarian (Dugesia japonica) that was derived from a single individual and that continued to undergo autotomous asexual reproduction for more than 20 years, and we performed large-scale genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis on it. Despite the fact that a completely clonal strain of the planarian was used, an unusually large number of mutations were detected. To enable quantitative genetic analysis of such a unique organism, we developed a new model called the Reference Gene Model, and used it to conduct large-scale transcriptome analysis. The results revealed large numbers of mutations not only outside but also inside gene-coding regions. Non-synonymous SNPs were detected in 74% of the genes for which valid ORFs were predicted. Interestingly, the high-mutation genes, such as metabolism- and defense-related genes, were correlated with genes that were previously identified as diverse genes among different planarian species. Although a large number of amino acid substitutions were apparently accumulated during asexual reproduction over this long period of time, the planarian maintained normal body-shape, behaviors, and physiological functions. The results of the present study reveal a unique aspect of asexual reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2177699625,"High drug costs due to supplier-induced demand (SID) obstruct healthcare accessibility in China. Drug prescriptions can generate markup-related profits, and the low prices of other medical services can lead to labor-force underestimations; therefore, physicians are keen to prescribe drugs rather than services. Thus, in China, a public hospital reform has been instituted to cancel markups and increase service prices.A retrospective pre/post-reform study was conducted in ZJ province to assess the impact of the reform on healthcare expenditures and utilization, ultimately to inform policy development and decision-making. The main indicators are healthcare expenditures and utilization.Post-reform, drug expenditures per visit decreased by 8.2% and 15.36% in outpatient and inpatient care, respectively; service expenditures per visit increased by 23.03% and 27.69% in outpatient and inpatient care, respectively. Drug utilization per visit increased by 5.58% in outpatient care and underwent no significant change in inpatient care. Both were lower than the theoretical drug-utilization level, which may move along the demand curve because of patient-initiated demand (PID); this indicates that SID-promoted drug utilization may decrease. Finally, service utilization per visit increased by 6% in outpatient care and by 13.10% in inpatient care; both were higher than the theoretical level moving along the demand curve, and this indicates that SID-promoted service utilization may increase.The reform reduces drug-prescription profits by eliminating drug markups; additionally, it compensates for service costs by increasing service prices. Post-reform, the SID of drug prescriptions decreased, which may reduce drug-resource waste. The SID of services increased, with potentially positive and negative effects: accessibility to services may be promoted when physicians provide more services, but the risk of resource waste may also increase. This warrants further research. It is recommended that comprehensive measures that control SID and promote physician enthusiasm be carried out concurrently."
https://openalex.org/W2176794059,"Among several receptor-like kinases (RLKs), leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) are a major group of genes that play crucial roles in growth, development and stress responses in plant systems. Given that they have several functional roles, it is important to investigate their roles in Brassica rapa. In the present study, 303 LRR-RLKs were identified in the genome of B. rapa and comparative phylogenetic analysis of 1213 combined LRR-RLKs of B. rapa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa helped us to categorize the gene family into 15 subfamilies based on their sequence and structural similarities. The chromosome localizations of 293 genes allowed the prediction of duplicates, and motif conservation and intron/exon patterns showed differences among the B. rapa LRR-RLK (BrLRR-RLK) genes. Additionally, computational function annotation and expression analysis was used to predict their possible functional roles in the plant system. Biochemical results for 11 selected genes showed variations in phosphorylation activity. Interestingly, BrBAK1 showed strong auto-phosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation on its tyrosine and threonine residues compared with AtBAK1 in previous studies. The AtBAK1 receptor kinase is involved in plant growth and development, plant innate immunity, and programmed cell death, and our results suggest that BrBAK1 might also be involved in the same functions. Another interesting result was that BrBAK1, BrBRI1, BrPEPR1 and BrPEPR2 showed activity with both anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies, indicating that they might have dual-specificity kinase activity. This study provides comprehensive results for the BrLRR-RLKs, revealing expansion of the gene family through gene duplications, structural similarities and variations among the genes, and potential functional roles according to gene ontology, transcriptome profiling and biochemical analysis."

These appendages consist of long tubular structures that protrude away from the bacterial surface to interact with the host cell and/or promote motility. A proposed “ruler” protein tightly regulates the length of both the T3SS and the flagellum, but the molecular basis for this length control has remained poorly characterized and controversial. Using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T3SS as a model system, we report the first structure of a T3SS ruler protein, revealing a “ball-and-chain” architecture, with a globular C-terminal domain (the ball) preceded by a long intrinsically disordered N-terminal polypeptide chain. The dimensions and stability of the globular domain do not support its potential passage through the inner lumen of the T3SS needle. We further demonstrate that a conserved motif at the N terminus of the ruler protein interacts with the T3SS autoprotease in the cytosolic side. Collectively, these data suggest a potential mechanism for needle length sensing by ruler proteins, whereby upon T3SS needle assembly, the ruler protein's N-terminal end is anchored on the cytosolic side, with the globular domain located on the extracellular end of the growing needle.

Pathogenic bacteria interact with the cells from infected hosts through a number of multiprotein appendages on their surface, including flagella, fimbriae, pili, and secretion apparatus (1Fronzes R.

Both complexes consist of a basal body portion embedded in and spanning the membrane(s) of the species that encode them, a cytoplasmic export apparatus (also responsible for rotation in the case of the flagellum), and the needle (T3SS) or hook/filament (flagellum) protruding away from the bacterium (5Kawamoto A.

The assembly of the T3SS and flagellum follows a similar, tightly regulated pathway (6Büttner D.

First the inner membrane components of the export apparatus and basal body assemble and then recruit the outer membrane proteins. This complex is capable of secreting early effectors, namely the needle (T3SS) and hook (flagellum), which assemble on the extracellular side. Upon completion of these structures, a so-called “substrate switching” event causes the arrest of needle/hook elongation and initiates secretion of the intermediate effectors (tip and translocon for the T3SS, filament for the flagellum). In the case of the T3SS, a second substrate-switching event is triggered by the contact with a target cell, leading to the secretion of late effectors. Several conserved components of the T3SS and the flagellum have been implicated in substrate switching, primarily the so-called ruler protein (FliK, YscP, Spa32, InvJ, and EscP in the flagellum, Yersinia T3SS, Shigella T3SS, Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli T3SS, respectively), the deletion of which leads to the formation of abnormally long needles in the T3SS (9Stainier I.

The needle length of bacterial injectisomes is determined by a molecular ruler.Science. 2003; 302: 1757-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) on the Yersinia enterocolitica T3SS ruler protein YscP showed a linear correlation between the length of the yscP gene and the length of the T3SS needle. From this observation, the authors hypothesized that YscP physically measures the length of the needle by anchoring on the cytoplasmic and extracellular ends of the needle and spanning through its lumen. In addition, co-expression of two YscP mutant proteins of different length in vivo led to two distinct T3SS populations with needle length matching either mutant protein. This supported the model that a single ruler protein regulates needle length in each individual T3SS complex (27Wagner S. Stenta M. Metzger L.C. Dal Peraro M. Cornelis G.R.

However, the precise mechanism of needle length measurement and substrate switching remains highly controversial, with many competing models being proposed (28Aizawa S.

Sequence and mutagenesis analyses of YscP indicate that this protein consists of two domains. At the N-terminal span of the sequence, a predicted helical region is responsible for dictating needle length (referred to as the length-sensing (LS) domain, residues 1–402). In the C-terminal region, a predicted globular domain (residues 403–492; described previously as the type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T3S4) domain, which for clarity we will refer to as the substrate-switching (SS) domain), is necessary for the hierarchical switching of substrates during T3SS assembly and subsequent virulence effector secretion (26Journet L.

Callebaut I. Journet L. Sorg I. Paroz C. Mota L.J. Cornelis G.R. Characterization of a type III secretion substrate specificity switch (T3S4) domain in YscP from Yersinia enterocolitica.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we report the first structure of a T3SS ruler protein, using the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model system, revealing a “ball-and-chain” architecture consisting of an intrinsically disordered LS domain followed by a globular, highly stable SS domain. The conserved LPXLG motif is critical in formation of a β-hairpin that lends to the unusual stability of the SS domain. We also observe that the size and stability of the SS domain would not support its possible secretion through the T3SS needle, suggesting that it is located on the extracellular side prior to needle elongation. Finally, we report the crystal structure of the P. aeruginosa autoprotease PscU and demonstrate that it binds to a sequence motif at the N-terminal end of PscP, which is highly conserved across T3SS and flagellar variants. Collectively, these data indicate that the ruler protein is anchored to the cytoplasm at its N terminus, whereas the C-terminal SS domain sits on the extracellular side prior to needle assembly, forming an external anchor. Sequence analysis of other T3SS and flagellar ruler proteins suggests that both the SS domain fold and the interaction between the ruler and autoprotease are probably conserved in all systems, indicative of a common mechanism. All constructs for purification were cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen), with an N-terminal thrombin-cleavable His10 tag, using restriction-free cloning (33van den Ent F. Löwe J. RF cloning: a restriction-free method for inserting target genes into plasmids.J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2006; 67: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). For co-purification experiments, the genes coding for PscU(210–348), PscP(1–369), PscP(1–255) and PscP(256–369) were cloned into pET21a, and the genes coding for PscP(20–40) and PscP(350–369) were cloned into pET SUMO. Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells, and transformants were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 14 h. Cells were harvested at 6,000 × g for 15 min, pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl with an added protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and cells were lysed by sonication for 10 min. Proteins were purified from the supernatant using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Roche Applied Science) and eluted with lysis buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The His10 tag was cleaved using thrombin (Roche Applied Science) at a 1:1,000 dilution, at 4 °C for 14 h. Proteins were further purified by gel filtration, using a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in lysis buffer. For NMR experiments, proteins were expressed in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/liter 15N-labeled NH4Cl. Purification was performed as above. Protein samples were concentrated to 0.2–0.5 mm and dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 10% D2O. All spectra were collected using a 600-MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer, equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (34Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G.

Initial crystallization trials were performed by sitting drop vapor diffusion using a Phoenix drop setter (Rigaku). Crystals of PscP(256–369) were obtained in a range of conditions, with optimal diffraction obtained in 0.1 m citric acid, 20% PEG 60000, pH 5.0, at 20 °C. Crystals of PscU(220–341) grew in a range of conditions containing 20% PEG 3350, but these showed no diffraction. In addition, small rod-shaped crystals were obtained at 4 °C in 1 m diammonium hydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.5, that diffracted to ∼3 Å. For data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in the crystallization condition supplemented with 30% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Native data sets were collected at beamline CMCF-1 of the Canadian Light Source, at 100 K. For PscP(256–369), an iodide derivative was obtained by soaking in 0.1 m citric acid, 20% PEG 60000, 0.5 m sodium iodide, pH 5.0, for 10 min, and a data set was collected at a home x-ray source. The structure of PscP(256–369) was solved by SAD using Phenix (36Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Jain S. Kapral G.J. Grosse Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J.

The PscP(256–369) and PscU(220–341) structures were refined to 2.10 and 2.90 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1), and both have good stereochemistry, with 98.9 and 95.0% (respectively) of residues in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers. We note the presence of density in the PscP(256–369) structure that we attributed to two glycerol molecules, which was present in the cryoprotectant and therefore is unlikely to be biologically relevant.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsPscPIodide derivativeNativePscU (native)Data collectionWavelength (Å)1.540.979490.97949Resolution range (Å)51.45–2.21 (2.33–2.21)50.92–2.1 (2.174–2.1)42.61–2.90 (3.00–2.90)Space groupC2C2P 64Unit cell104.70, 44.04, 25.74 Å; 90, 100.61, 90°103.14, 42.48, 25.86 Å; 90, 99.07, 90°68.59, 68.59, 61.21 Å; 90, 90, 120°Total reflections41,303 (5,426)21,327 (3,172)7,353 (726)Unique reflections5,580 (745)6,182 (891)3,694 (365)Multiplicity7.4 (7.3)3.4 (3.6)2.0 (2.0)Completeness (%)95.6 (84.9)94.6 (93.4)99.8 (99.7)Mean I/σ(I)16.6 (5.5)7.2 (2.0)7.6 (2.0)R-merge0.079 (0.349)0.083 (0.576)0.087 (0.398)RefinementR-work0.1910.196R-free0.2270.226No. of atoms774867Macromolecules729860Ligands120Water337Protein residues94107r.m.s. bonds (Å)0.0120.012r.m.s. angles (degrees)1.6951.116Ramachandran favored (%)98.995Ramachandran outliers (%)00Clashscore14.546.26Average B-factor47.154.3Macromolecules46.854.5Ligands60.6Solvent48.237.4 Open table in a new tab For the Rosetta helical modeling, we initially applied the procedure described by DiMaio et al. (44DiMaio F. Leaver-Fay A. Bradley P. Baker D. André I. Modeling symmetric macromolecular structures in Rosetta3.PLoS One. 2011; 6: e20450Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), based on the PscF-PrgI alignment shown on Fig. 4A and using the solid state NMR-derived PrgI structure (Protein Data Bank entry 2LPZ) for both helical symmetry and homology model template. This led to a number of clusters of models, the lowest energy of which resembled the PrgI needle, but other clusters had an unrealistic conformation with a much larger needle where protomers made very few contacts. To further help with the conformational space search, we added an additional restraint to the modeling protocol to account for the fit to the MxiH EM map (to avoid model bias), at 25 Å resolution (Electron Microscopy Data Bank ID 1416). This approach led to the modeling procedure converging to a single cluster of models (Fig. 4B). To obtain an in-frame deletion of pscP, we used a three-step fusion PCR (45Kuwayama H. Obara S. Morio T. Katoh M. Urushihara H. Tanaka Y. PCR-mediated generation of a gene disruption construct without the use of DNA ligase and plasmid vectors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) construct in which pscP was replaced by a gentamicin cassette. Briefly, primers were designed to amplify 1-kb-long fragments flanking pscP in the P. aeruginosa PA14 chromosome as well as to amplify the gentamicin resistance gene from plasmid pPS858. The resulting fragments were fused via two PCRs. The resulting fragment was cloned into the suicide vector pEX18Amp (46Hoang T.T. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Kutchma A.J. Schweizer H.P. A broad-host-range Flp-FRT recombination system for site-specific excision of chromosomally-located DNA sequences: application for isolation of unmarked Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants.Gene. 1998; 212: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), which was transformed into E. coli S17–1λpir, from which it was transferred by conjugation into P. aeruginosa strain H103 with a fliC mutant to generate deletion of pscP by allelic exchange. Colonies carrying the gentamicin cassette were selected by growing the cells from the conjugation on plates containing 30 μg/ml gentamicin for 24–48 h. The obtained colonies were then passed twice on plates containing 15 μg/ml gentamicin and 5% (w/v) sucrose to select for double recombinants. The correct deletion of pscP was subsequently confirmed by PCR and sequencing. For T3SS expression, we transformed the P. aeruginosa strain H103 ΔfliC or P. aeruginosa strain H103 ΔfliC/pscP with the plasmid pHERD20T containing the exsA gene and grew these in LB medium complemented with 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm MgCl2. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase, and ExsA expression was induced with 0.02% arabinose at 37 °C for 3 h. Cultures were applied on glow-discharged carbon grids and stained using 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were collected on a Technai G2 transmission electron microscope (FEI) operating at 200 kV and equipped with a high speed AMT 2K side mount CCD camera. Differential scanning calorimetry experiments were carried out using 0.3 mg/ml protein in the specified buffer, with SYPRO Orange (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5× final concentration. A 25-μl assay volume mixture was transferred into a MicroAmp Fast optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems), and thermal denaturation was monitored in an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus RT-PCR system using the ROX filter set (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 620 nm) at a rate of 1 °C/min from 25 to 95 °C with fluorescence measured every 0.5 °C. For the peptide-mapping assay, peptides were synthesized directly onto a modified cellulose membrane covalently via a polyethylene glycol linker using a MultiPep peptide synthesizer (Intavis), consisting of 15–17-amino acid segments of the PscP protein sequence for a total of 116 peptides. A 16-polyhistidine peptide was also synthesized as a positive control. The membrane containing the immobilized peptides was washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) and blocked with 5% skim milk powder in PBST for 1 h followed by washing with PBST and PBS. The membrane was then incubated with 0.3 μm PscUC-His in PBS (or only PBS for the control PscUC-negative experiment) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by extensive washing with PBST. The membrane was again blocked with 10% skim milk powder in PBST for 1 h, followed by extensive washing with PBST. Next, the membrane was incubated with a 1:5,000-diluted HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody (Alpha Diagnostics) in 5% skim milk powder in PBST for 1 h followed by washing with PBST. Finally, the membrane was developed with ECL reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film for 1 min. For the co-purification experiments, plasmids for the two proteins or mutants were transformed into competent BL21(DE3) cells and grown in 50 ml of LB at 37 °C to mid-log phase. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and proteins were expressed at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested at 6,000 rpm for 15 min, and pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer and sonicated at 40% amplitude for 1 min. Debris was pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and then with 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 75 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Proteins were eluted with 100 μl of lysis buffer complemented with 1 m isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. In the case of the co-purification of the PscP domains with His-PscUC, expression of PscUC was reduced when co-expressed with the SS domain of PscP. To compensate, the various PscP domains were expressed individually, and the cell lysate was added to purified PscUC-His (WT or N263A mutant) prior to the co-purification. To characterize the molecular mechanism of needle length control, we attempted to express and purify the Yersinia ruler protein YscP, which had been exte"

One such strategy that has been delineated in this study is the abrogation of lytic activity of lysozyme by a novel glycosylated and surface-localized lipoprotein, LprI, which is exclusively present in M. tuberculosis complex. The lprI gene co-transcribes with the glbN gene (encoding hemoglobin (HbN)) and both are synchronously up-regulated in M. tuberculosis during macrophage infection. Recombinant LprI, expressed in Escherichia coli, exhibited strong binding (Kd ≤ 2 nm) with lysozyme and abrogated its lytic activity completely, thereby conferring protection to fluorescein-labeled Micrococcus lysodeikticus from lysozyme-mediated hydrolysis. Expression of the lprI gene in Mycobacterium smegmatis (8–10-fold) protected its growth from lysozyme inhibition in vitro and enhanced its phagocytosis and survival during intracellular infection of peritoneal and monocyte-derived macrophages, known to secrete lysozyme, and in the presence of exogenously added lysozyme in secondary cell lines where lysozyme levels are low. In contrast, the presence of HbN enhanced phagocytosis and intracellular survival of M. smegmatis only in the absence of lysozyme but not under lysozyme stress. Interestingly, co-expression of the glbN-lprI gene pair elevated the invasion and survival of M. smegmatis 2–3-fold in secondary cell lines in the presence of lysozyme in comparison with isogenic cells expressing these genes individually. Thus, specific advantage against macrophage-generated lysozyme, conferred by the combination of LprI-HbN during invasion of M. tuberculosis, may have vital implications on the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

https://openalex.org/W2178503468,"Anopheles sinensis is an important malaria vector in China and other Southeast Asian countries, and the emergence of insecticide resistance in this mosquito poses a serious threat to the efficacy of malaria control programs. The recently published An. sinensis genome and transcriptome provide an opportunity to understand the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance. Analysis of the An. sinensis genome revealed 174 detoxification genes, including 93 cytochrome P450s (P450s), 31 glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and 50 choline/carboxylesterases (CCEs). The gene number was similar to that in An. gambiae, but represented a decrease of 29% and 42% compared with Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus, respectively. The considerable contraction in gene number in Anopheles mosquitoes mainly occurred in two detoxification supergene families, P450s and CCEs. The available An. sinensis transcriptome was also re-analyzed to further identify key resistance-associated detoxification genes. Among 174 detoxification genes, 124 (71%) were detected. Several candidate genes overexpressed in a deltamethrin-resistant strain (DR-strain) were identified as belonging to the CYP4 or CYP6 family of P450s and the Delta GST class. These generated data provide a basis for identifying the resistance-associated genes of An. sinensis at the molecular level."

The study aims to investigate the airway changes after orthodontic extraction treatment in adult patients with Class II and hyperdivergent skeletal malocclusion. Materials and Methods This retrospective study enrolled 18 adults with Class II and hyperdivergent skeletal malocclusion (5 males and 13 females, 24.1 ± 3.8 years of age, BMI 20.33 ± 1.77 kg/m2). And 18 untreated controls were matched 1:1 with the treated patients for age, sex, BMI, and skeletal pattern. CBCT images before and after treatment were obtained. DOLPHIN 11.7 software was used to reconstruct and measure the airway size, hyoid position, and craniofacial structures. Changes in the airway and craniofacial parameters from pre to post treatment were assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mann-Whitney U test was used in comparisons of the airway parameters between the treated patients and the untreated controls. Significant level was set at 0.05. Results The upper and lower incisors retracted 7.87 mm and 6.10 mm based on the measurement of U1-VRL and L1-VRL (P < 0.01), while the positions of the upper and lower molars (U6-VRL, and L6-VRL) remained stable. Volume, height, and cross-sectional area of the airway were not significantly changed after treatment, while the sagittal dimensions of SPP-SPPW, U-MPW, PAS, and V-LPW were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), and the morphology of the cross sections passing through SPP-SPPW, U-MPW, PAS, and V-LPW became anteroposteriorly compressed (P <0.001). No significant differences in the airway volume, height, and cross-sectional area were found between the treated patients and untreated controls. Conclusions The airway changes after orthodontic treatment with premolar extraction and maximum anchorage in adults are mainly morphological changes with anteroposterior dimension compressed in airway cross sections, rather than a decrease in size."
https://openalex.org/W2174648861,"Diverse lines of evidence suggest that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides causally contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder. However, the mechanisms by which Aβ impairs neuronal functions remain to be fully elucidated. Previous studies showed that soluble Aβ oligomers interfere with synaptic functions by depleting NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) from the neuronal surface and that overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 can counteract this process. Through pharmacological treatments and biochemical analyses of primary neuronal cultures expressing wild-type or mutant forms of EphB2, we demonstrate that this protective effect of EphB2 depends on its PDZ-binding motif and the presence of neuronal activity but not on its kinase activity. We further present evidence that the protective effect of EphB2 may be mediated by the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA2, which can become associated with the PDZ-binding motif of EphB2 through PDZ domain-containing proteins and can promote the retention of NMDARs in the membrane. In addition, we show that the Aβ-induced depletion of surface NMDARs does not depend on several factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Aβ-induced neuronal dysfunction, including aberrant neuronal activity, tau, prion protein (PrPC), and EphB2 itself. Thus, although EphB2 does not appear to be directly involved in the Aβ-induced depletion of NMDARs, increasing its expression may counteract this pathogenic process through a neuronal activity- and PDZ-dependent regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2177193623,"Objectives The contribution of ultrasound-assisted thoracic paravertebral block to postoperative analgesia remains unclear. We compared the effect of a combination of ultrasound assisted-thoracic paravertebral block and propofol general anesthesia with opioid and sevoflurane general anesthesia on volatile anesthetic, propofol and opioid consumption, and postoperative pain in patients having breast cancer surgery. Methods Patients undergoing breast cancer surgery were randomly assigned to ultrasound-assisted paravertebral block with propofol general anesthesia (PPA group, n = 121) or fentanyl with sevoflurane general anesthesia (GA group, n = 126). Volatile anesthetic, propofol and opioid consumption, and postoperative pain intensity were compared between the groups using noninferiority and superiority tests. Results Patients in the PPA group required less sevoflurane than those in the GA group (median [interquartile range] of 0 [0, 0] vs. 0.4 [0.3, 0.6] minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]-hours), less intraoperative fentanyl requirements (100 [50, 100] vs. 250 [200, 300]μg,), less intense postoperative pain (median visual analog scale score 2 [1, 3.5] vs. 3 [2, 4.5]), but more propofol (median 529 [424, 672] vs. 100 [100, 130] mg). Noninferiority was detected for all four outcomes; one-tailed superiority tests for each outcome were highly significant at P<0.001 in the expected directions. Conclusions The combination of propofol anesthesia with ultrasound-assisted paravertebral block reduces intraoperative volatile anesthetic and opioid requirements, and results in less post operative pain in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.

https://openalex.org/W2239368931,"MicroRNA regulation of protein expression plays an important role in mediating many cellular processes, from cell proliferation to cell death. The human microRNA miR-424 is up-regulated in response to anti-proliferative cytokines, such as transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and directly represses cell cycle progression. Our laboratory recently established that microRNA can be used as a proxy to identify biological roles of glycosylation enzymes (glycogenes). Herein we identify MGAT4A, OGT, and GALNT13 as targets of miR-424. We demonstrate that MGAT4A, an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that installs the β-1,4 branch of N-glycans, is directly regulated by miR-424 in multiple mammary epithelial cell lines and observe the loss of MGAT4A in response to TGFβ, an inducer of miR-424. Knockdown of MGAT4A induces cell cycle arrest through decreasing CCND1 levels. MGAT4A does not affect levels of β-1,6 branched N-glycans, arguing that this effect is specific to β-1,4 branching and not due to gross changes in overall N-linked glycosylation. This work provides insight into the regulation of cell cycle progression by specific N-glycan branching patterns. MicroRNA regulation of protein expression plays an important role in mediating many cellular processes, from cell proliferation to cell death. The human microRNA miR-424 is up-regulated in response to anti-proliferative cytokines, such as transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and directly represses cell cycle progression. Our laboratory recently established that microRNA can be used as a proxy to identify biological roles of glycosylation enzymes (glycogenes). Herein we identify MGAT4A, OGT, and GALNT13 as targets of miR-424. We demonstrate that MGAT4A, an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that installs the β-1,4 branch of N-glycans, is directly regulated by miR-424 in multiple mammary epithelial cell lines and observe the loss of MGAT4A in response to TGFβ, an inducer of miR-424.

https://openalex.org/W2174036988,"Induction of anthocyanin accumulation by osmotic stress was assessed in 360 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana. A wide range of natural variation, with phenotypes ranging from green to completely red/purple rosettes, was observed. A genome wide association (GWA) mapping approach revealed that sequence diversity in a small 15 kb region on chromosome 1 explained 40% of the variation observed. Sequence and expression analyses of alleles of the candidate gene MYB90 identified a causal polymorphism at amino acid (AA) position 210 of this transcription factor of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. This amino acid discriminates the two most frequent alleles of MYB90. Both alleles are present in a substantial part of the population, suggesting balancing selection between these two alleles. Analysis of the geographical origin of the studied accessions suggests that the macro climate is not the driving force behind positive or negative selection for anthocyanin accumulation. An important role for local climatic conditions is, therefore, suggested. This study emphasizes that GWA mapping is a powerful approach to identify alleles that are under balancing selection pressure in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2175574869,"Although there is much evidence showing functional relationship between Hedgehog pathway, in particular Sonic hedgehog, and SOX transcription factors during embryonic development, scarce data are available regarding their crosstalk in cancer cells. SOX18 protein plays an important role in promoting tumor angiogenesis and therefore emerged as a promising potential target in antiangiogenic tumor therapy. Recently it became evident that expression of SOX18 gene in tumors is not restricted to endothelium of accompanying blood and lymphatic vessels, but in tumor cells as well.In this paper we have identified human SOX18 gene as a novel target gene of Hedgehog signaling in cervical carcinoma cell lines. We have presented data showing that expression of SOX18 gene is regulated by GLI1 and GLI2 transcription factors, final effectors of Hedgehog signaling, and that modulation of Hedgehog signaling activity in considerably influence SOX18 expression. We consider important that Hedgehog pathway inhibitors reduced SOX18 expression, thus showing, for the first time, possibility for manipulationwith SOX18 gene expression. In addition, we analyzed the role of SOX18 in malignant potential of cervical carcinoma cell line, and showed that its overexpression has no influence on cells proliferation and viability, but substantially promotes migration and invasion of cells in vitro. Pro-migratory effect of SOX18 suggests its role in promoting malignant spreading, possibly in response to Hedgehog activation."
https://openalex.org/W2180550475,"Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a potent regulator of phosphate (Pi) and vitamin D homeostasis. The transcription factor, early growth response 1 (egr-1), is a biomarker for FGF23-induced activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. We have shown that ERK1/2 signaling blockade suppresses renal egr-1 gene expression and prevents FGF23-induced hypophosphatemia and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) suppression in mice. To test whether egr-1 itself mediates these renal actions of FGF23, we administered FGF23 to egr-1-/- and wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, FGF23 induced hypophosphatemia and suppressed expression of the renal Na/Pi cotransporters, Npt2a and Npt2c. In FGF23-treated egr-1-/- mice, hypophosphatemic response was greatly blunted and Na/Pi cotransporter expression was not suppressed. In contrast, FGF23 induced equivalent suppression of serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations by suppressing renal cyp27b1 and stimulating cyp24a1 mRNA expression in both groups of mice. Thus, downstream of receptor binding and ERK1/2 signaling, we can distinguish the effector pathway that mediates FGF23-dependent inhibition of Pi transport from the pathway that mediates inhibition of 1,25(OH)2D synthesis in the kidney. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the hypophosphatemic effect of FGF23 is significantly blunted in Hyp/egr-1-/- mice; specifically, serum Pi concentrations and renal Npt2a and Npt2c mRNA expression are significantly higher in Hyp/egr-1-/- mice than in Hyp mice. We then characterized the egr-1 cistrome in the kidney using ChIP-sequencing and demonstrate recruitment of egr-1 to regulatory DNA elements in proximity to several genes involved in Pi transport. Thus, our data demonstrate that the effect of FGF23 on Pi homeostasis is mediated, at least in part, by activation of egr-1."

However, ocular hazardous effects to air pollutants are scarcely found in the literature.Panel study to evaluate the effect of different levels of ambient air pollution on lacrimal film cytokine levels of outdoor workers from a large metropolitan area.Thirty healthy male workers, among them nineteen professionals who work on streets (taxi drivers and traffic controllers, high pollutants exposure, Group 1) and eleven workers of a Forest Institute (Group 2, lower pollutants exposure compared to group 1) were evaluated twice, 15 days apart. Exposure to ambient PM2.5 (particulate matter equal or smaller than 2.5 μm) was 24 hour individually collected and the collection of tears was performed to measure interleukins (IL) 2, 4, 5 and 10 and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels. Data from both groups were compared using Student's t test or Mann- Whitney test for cytokines. Individual PM2.5 levels were categorized in tertiles (lower, middle and upper) and compared using one-way ANOVA. Relationship between PM2.5 and cytokine levels was evaluated using generalized estimating equations (GEE).PM2.5 levels in the three categories differed significantly (lower: ≤22 μg/m3; middle: 23-37.5 μg/m3; upper: >37.5 μg/m3; p<0.001). The subjects from the two groups were distributed unevenly in the lower category (Group 1 = 8%; Group 2 = 92%), the middle category (Group 1 = 89%; Group 2 = 11%) and the upper category (Group 1 = 100%). A significant relationship was found between IL-5 and IL-10 and PM2.5 levels of the group 1, with an average decrease of 1.65 pg/mL of IL-5 level and of 0.78 pg/mL of IL-10 level in tear samples for each increment of 50 μg/m3 of PM2.5 (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003, respectively).High levels of PM2.5 exposure is associated with decrease of IL-5 and IL-10 levels suggesting a possible modulatory action of ambient air pollution on ocular surface immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2279426378,"The identification of potential vaccine candidates against leptospirosis remains a challenge. However, one such candidate is OmpL37, a potentially surface-exposed antigen that has the highest elastin-binding ability described to date, suggesting that it plays an important role in host colonization. In order to evaluate OmpL37's ability to induce a protective immune response, prime-boost, DNA and subunit vaccine strategies were tested in the hamster model of lethal leptospirosis. The humoral immune response was evaluated using an indirect ELISA test, and the cytokine profile in whole blood was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Unlike the DNA vaccine, the administration of recombinant OmpL37 induced a strong IgG antibody response. When individually administrated, both formulations stimulated a TNF-α mediated inflammatory response. However, none of the OmpL37 formulations or vaccination strategies induced protective immunity. Further studies are required towards the identification of new vaccine targets against leptospirosis."

Intra-tumoral biomarker heterogeneity however, commonly observed in gastric cancer, could lead to biased selection of patients. MET, ATM, FGFR2, and HER2 were profiled on gastric cancer biopsy samples. An innovative pathological assessment was performed through scoring of individual biopsies against whole biopsies from a single patient to enable heterogeneity evaluation. Following this, false negative risks for each biomarker were estimated in silico. 166 gastric cancer cases with multiple biopsies from single patients were collected from Shanghai Renji Hospital. Following pre-set criteria, 56 ~ 78% cases showed low, 15 ~ 35% showed medium and 0 ~ 11% showed high heterogeneity within the biomarkers profiled. If 3 biopsies were collected from a single patient, the false negative risk for detection of the biomarkers was close to 5% (exception for FGFR2: 12.2%). When 6 biopsies were collected, the false negative risk approached 0%. Our study demonstrates the benefit of multiple biopsy sampling when considering personalized healthcare biomarker strategy, and provides an example to address the challenge of intra-tumoral biomarker heterogeneity using alternative pathological assessment and statistical methods."

It shows a strong activity against acid-fast bacteria and is also active against rifampicin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here, we report the identification of the nocardithiocin gene cluster in N. pseudobrasiliensis IFM 0761 based on conserved thiopeptide biosynthesis gene sequence and the whole genome sequence. The predicted gene cluster was confirmed by gene disruption and complementation. As expected, strains containing the disrupted gene did not produce nocardithiocin while gene complementation restored nocardithiocin production in these strains. The predicted cluster was further analyzed using RNA-seq which showed that the nocardithiocin gene cluster contains 12 genes within a 15.2-kb region. This finding will promote the improvement of nocardithiocin productivity and its derivatives production."
https://openalex.org/W2286151249,"Recent years have witnessed a rapid development of network reconstruction approaches, especially for a series of methods based on compressed sensing. Although compressed-sensing based methods require much less data than conventional approaches, the compressed sensing for reconstructing heterogeneous networks has not been fully exploited because of hubs. Hub neighbors require much more data to be inferred than small-degree nodes, inducing a cask effect for the reconstruction of heterogeneous networks. Here, a conflict-based method is proposed to overcome the cast effect to considerably reduce data amounts for achieving accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an element elimination method is presented to use the partially available structural information to reduce data requirements. The integration of both methods can further improve the reconstruction performance than separately using each technique. These methods are validated by exploring two evolutionary games taking place in scale-free networks, where individual information is accessible and an attempt to decode the network structure from measurable data is made. The results demonstrate that for all of the cases, much data are saved compared to that in the absence of these two methods. Due to the prevalence of heterogeneous networks in nature and society and the high cost of data acquisition in large-scale networks, these approaches have wide applications in many fields and are valuable for understanding and controlling the collective dynamics of a variety of heterogeneous networked systems."

Six measures were collected through direct observation by an external surveyor and one was assessed through a questionnaire completed by hospital quality managers. Dependent variables included 24 clinical practice indicators based on case note reviews covering the 4 conditions (acute myocardial infarction, deliveries, hip fracture and stroke). A directed acyclic graph was used to encode relationships between predictors, outcomes, and covariates and to guide the choice of covariates to control for confounding.Data were provided on 9021 clinical records by 276 departments in 73 hospitals. There were substantial variations in compliance with the 24 clinical practice indicators. Weak associations were observed between hospital quality systems and 4 of the 24 indicators, but on analyzing department-level quality systems, strong associations were observed for 8 of the 11 indicators for acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Clinical indicators supported by higher levels of evidence were more frequently associated with quality systems and activities.There are significant gaps between recommended standards of care and clinical practice in a large sample of hospitals. Implementation of department-level quality strategies was significantly associated with good clinical practice. Further research should aim to develop clinically relevant quality standards for hospital departments, which appear to be more effective than generic hospital-wide quality systems."

Further, the molecular mechanisms mediating nicotine-induced breast cancer cell progression have not been fully investigated. This study aims to investigate whether iPLA2β mediates nicotine-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and migration through both in-vitro and in-vivo techniques. Subsequently, the ability of Bromoenol Lactone (BEL) to attenuate the severity of nicotine-induced breast cancer was examined. Method and Results We found that BEL significantly attenuated both basal and nicotine-induced 4T1 breast cancer cell proliferation, via an MTT proliferation assay. Breast cancer cell migration was examined by both a scratch and transwell assay, in which, BEL was found to significantly decrease both basal and nicotine-induced migration. Additionally, nicotine-induced MMP-9 expression was found to be mediated in an iPLA2β dependent manner. These results suggest that iPLA2β plays a critical role in mediating both basal and nicotine-induced breast cancer cell proliferation and migration in-vitro. In an in-vivo mouse breast cancer model, BEL treatment was found to significantly reduce both basal (p<0.05) and nicotine-induced tumor growth (p<0.01). Immunohistochemical analysis showed BEL decreased nicotine-induced MMP-9, HIF-1alpha, and CD31 tumor tissue expression. Subsequently, BEL was observed to reduce nicotine-induced lung metastasis. Conclusion The present study indicates that nicotine-induced migration is mediated by MMP-9 production in an iPLA2β dependent manner. Our data suggests that BEL is a possible chemotherapeutic agent as it was found to reduce both nicotine-induced breast cancer tumor growth and lung metastasis."

The polyclonal character of commercial antivenoms, obtained through the immunization of animals and which contain several neutralizing antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the toxins, guarantees the neutralization of the venoms. To avoid the use of animals, we aimed to develop an equivalent recombinant antivenom composed of a few neutralizing single chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that bind to two different epitopes on the scorpion toxins. In this study, we obtained scFv RU1 derived from scFv C1. RU1 showed a good capacity to neutralize the Cn2 toxin and whole venom of the scorpion Centruroides noxius. Previously, we had produced scFv LR, obtained from a different parental fragment (scFv 3F). LR also showed a similar neutralizing capacity. The simultaneous administration of both scFvs resulted in improved protection, which was translated as a rapid recovery of previously poisoned animals. The crystallographic structure of the ternary complex scFv LR-Cn2-scFv RU1 allowed us to identify the areas of interaction of both scFvs with the toxin, which correspond to non-overlapping sites. The epitope recognized by scFv RU1 seems to be related to a greater efficiency in the neutralization of the whole venom. In addition, the structural analysis of the complex helped us to explain the cross-reactivity of these scFvs and how they neutralize the venom.

Diagnosed with hematological malignancies constitute a serious unpredictable and uncontrollable medical stress situation and patients are susceptible to suffer from depressive symptoms. The aims of the study were to explore the correlation between perceived stress and depressive symptoms in patients with hematological malignancies, and assess the mediating role of mental adjustment between these variables.A single center, cross-sectional study was performed by convenience sampling between July 2013 and April 2014 in a hospital of China. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Mini-Mental Adjustment Scale, as well as questions about demographic and clinical factors was distributed to 300 hematological cancer patients. Completed questionnaires were received from 227 inpatients.The results showed that perceived stress was positively correlated with depressive symptoms. The mental adjustment significantly mediated the relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms.Among hematological cancer patients perceived stress may be a risk factor for depressive symptoms, whereas positive coping style might be protective against depressive symptoms.

https://openalex.org/W2179040111,"Although safe doses of radiation have been determined, concerns about the harmful effects of low-dose radiation persist. In particular, to date, few studies have investigated the correlation between low-dose radiation and disease development. Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory airway disease that is recognized as a major public health problem. In this study, we evaluated the effects of low-dose-rate chronic irradiation on allergic asthma in a murine model. Mice were sensitized and airway-challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and were exposed to continuous low-dose-rate irradiation (0.554 or 1.818 mGy/h) for 24 days after initial sensitization. The effects of chronic radiation on proinflammatory cytokines and the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were investigated. Exposure to low-dose-rate chronic irradiation significantly decreased the number of inflammatory cells, methylcholine responsiveness (PenH value), and the levels of OVA-specific immunoglobulin E, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5. Furthermore, airway inflammation and the mucus production in lung tissue were attenuated and elevated MMP-9 expression and activity induced by OVA challenge were significantly suppressed. These results indicate that low-dose-rate chronic irradiation suppresses allergic asthma induced by OVA challenge and does not exert any adverse effects on asthma development. Our findings can potentially provide toxicological guidance for the safe use of radiation and relieve the general anxiety about exposure to low-dose radiation."

In addition to regulating cell migration, Gα13 can weaken adherens junctions by binding to E-cadherin and displacing β-catenin from adherens junctions (19Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J.

Recently, Gα13 has also been shown to disrupt endothelial adherens junctions by binding to VE-cadherin and causing VE-cadherin internalization (21Gong H. Gao X. Feng S. Siddiqui M.R. Garcia A.

The gep proto-oncogene Gα13 mediates lysophosphatidic acid-mediated migration of pancreatic cancer cells.Pancreas. 2013; 42: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which Gα13 contributes to pancreatic cancer cell invasion in three-dimensional collagen is not well known. In this study, we show that Gα13 is up-regulated in human PDAC tumors and, using a quantitative method to track cell invasion in three-dimensional collagen gels, we demonstrate that knockdown of Gα13 decreased MT1-MMP-driven proteolytic invasion of PDAC cells in three-dimensional collagen and enhanced E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Although E-cadherin knockdown reversed the effect of Gα13 siRNA-induced cell-cell adhesion, E-cadherin knockdown failed to reverse the effect of Gα13 siRNA on proteolytic invasion. Instead, concurrent knockdown of E-cadherin and Gα13 led to an increased number of single cells rather than groups of cells. Significantly, knockdown of DDR1 reversed the effect of Gα13 knockdown on cell-cell adhesion and proteolytic invasion. Additionally, knockdown of the polarity protein Par3, which can function downstream of DDR1, reversed the effect of Gα13 knockdown on cell-cell adhesion and proteolytic invasion. Overall, we show that Gα13 and DDR1-Par3 signaling differentially regulate cell-cell junctions and the actin cytoskeleton to mediate invasion in three-dimensional collagen.

Collagenase (catalog no. 4196) was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Co. Datasets analyzing mRNA from both normal and PDAC tumor samples were selected from the publicly available Oncomine database. The human pancreatic tissue microarray (TMA) was generated by the Pathology Core Facility at Northwestern University using specimens obtained on an institutional review board-approved protocol. The TMA was composed of 2-mm cores from 17 PDAC specimens and 15 normal pancreatic tissue specimens. Additional TMA slides (TMA-1421) with 2-mm cores from three normal pancreatic tissue samples and 20 PDAC cases were purchased from Protein Biotechnologies (Ramona, CA). Slides with 4-μm sections of the TMA were deparaffinized and stained with H&E or trichrome-stained using a Masson kit by the Pathology Core Facility (Northwestern University). The extent of fibrosis was determined by the blue trichrome stain in the TMA specimens: <25% of the TMA core with blue stain (low) or >25% of the TMA core with blue stain (high). For immunostaining, TMA slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a decreasing ethanol gradient, and then antigen retrieval was performed using a decloaking chamber at 110 °C for 10 min in BD Retrievagen A (pH 6.0) target retrieval solution, followed by blocking with Protein Block (Dako) and Peroxidase Block (Dako). The TMA slides were incubated with the primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against Gα13 (EPR5436, catalog no. ab128900, Abcam) overnight at 4 °C at 1:500 dilution in Dako antibody diluent. Following multiple washings with Dako wash buffer, the slides were incubated with anti-rabbit HRP-labeled polymer (Dako) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (Dako) for 1 min, and then the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. As specified on the Abcam web site for the ab128900 antibody, positive staining for Gα13 was indicated by the presence of a brown precipitate in the cytoplasm. The TMA cores were evaluated and scored as follows: 0, no staining or background staining; 1+, mild specific staining of malignant cells; 2+, moderate staining of malignant cells; 3+, the most intense staining of malignant cells. The specificity of the rabbit monoclonal ab128900 antibody for Gα13 was validated by knocking down Gα13 in CD18-tet-MT cells, creating a cell block and then embedding the cell block in paraffin. Control and Gα13 knockdown CD18-tet-MT cell blocks were then sectioned and stained as above for the TMA specimens. In additional controls, human PDAC tumor sections were processed for immunostaining using a rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody (catalog no. ab172730, Abcam) as an isotype control for the anti-Gα13 ab128900 antibody. CD18, Panc1, and SCC25 cells were purchased from the ATCC, whereas UMSCC1 cells were provided by Dr. E. Lengyel.

Cells grown in collagen gels were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope, and pictures were taken with a Nikon Coolpix 4500 camera. Collagen gels were then fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin by the Pathology Core Facility at Northwestern University. Six 8-μm sections from each of the collagen-paraffin blocks were cut from the top of the block to the same depth, stained with H&E, and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope and camera. Areas of cleaved collagen (“collagenolytic tracks”) were measured from a minimum of 10 fields/condition at ×10 magnification using ImageJ.

Briefly, PDAC cells were embedded in three-dimensional collagen (2.2 mg/ml) at 2 × 105 cells/plug (for inhibitor treatment) or 5 × 105 cells/plug (after transfection with siRNA) to form a cylinder-shaped plug. The plug was then inserted in an additional layer of collagen (2.2 mg/ml) to allow the formation of a core of cells surrounded by collagen. After contraction over a period of 5 days, pictures of the contracted cores were taken using an 8-megapixel iPhone 5S camera. PDAC cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and suspended in hanging drops as described previously (33Foty R. A simple hanging drop cell culture protocol for generation of 3D spheroids.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; (10.3791/2720)Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). For cells treated with the E-cadherin function-blocking antibody HECD-1, cells were incubated with 2 μm IgG or HECD-1 per drop for 30 min at room temperature prior to suspension in drops. After 18 h, cells were imaged, and pictures were taken using a Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope and a Nikon Coolpix 4500 camera. PDAC cells were plated on glass coverslips and transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 72 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 and then stained for E-cadherin and phalloidin. Images were taken on a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope at the Northwestern University Center for Advanced Microscopy (Chicago, IL). The relative intensity of E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions was determined using Image J. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (San Diego, CA).

Because Gα13, the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G13, is a major regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (35Gohla A. Offermanns S. Wilkie T.M. Schultz G.

As shown in Fig. 1A, there is an ∼2-fold increase in GNA13 mRNA levels in human PDAC tumors compared with normal tissue. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of human pancreatic TMAs showed that there is increased cytoplasmic staining of Gα13 protein in tumors compared with normal pancreas (Fig. 1, B and C). Because PDAC tumors are associated with a pronounced collagen-rich stromal reaction, as demonstrated by increased trichrome staining (Fig. 1B), we examined the relationship between fibrosis and Gα13 protein expression. We show that Gα13 protein levels are associated with increased fibrosis in human PDAC tumors (Fig. 1C). To examine the role of Gα13 in PDAC progression, we established a quantitative method to track MT1-MMP-dependent cell invasion in three-dimensional collagen gels using inducible expression of MT1-MMP in PDAC cells (hereafter referred to as PDAC-tet-MT cells; Fig. 2, A and B). Induction of MT1-MMP in CD18-tet-MT (Fig. 2C) and Panc1-tet-MT adenocarcinoma cells (data not shown) in three-dimensional type I collagen resulted in tracks generated by clearing of the pericellular collagen by invading cells, which was inhibited by the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001. We also examined the extent to which our system can track MT1-MMP-dependent invasion of squamous cell cancer (SCC) cells in three-dimensional collagen. Induction of MT1-MMP in SCC cells (UMSCC1 and SCC25 cells) also resulted in tracks generated by clearing of the pericellular collagen by the invading cells that was also inhibited by GM6001 (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2248428468,"Transverse aortic constriction provokes a pro-inflammatory reaction and results in cardiac hypertrophy. Endogenous ligands contribute to cardiac hypertrophy via toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 binding. A lack of TLR4 signaling diminishes hypertrophy and inflammation. Wild type mice undergoing aortic constriction respond to a lipopolysaccharide second-hit stimulus with hyperinflammation. The objective of this study was to assess whether other second-hit challenges utilizing TLR ligands provoke a comparable inflammatory reaction, and to find out whether this response is absent in TLR4 deficient mice. Assuming that cardiac stress alters the expression of pattern recognition receptors we analyzed the effects of transverse aortic constriction and second-hit virulence factor treatment on TLR expression, as well as cytokine regulation. Wild type and Tlr4-/- mice were subjected to three days of TAC and subsequently confronted with gram-positive TLR2 ligand lipoteichoic acid (LTA, 15mg/g bodyweight) or synthetic CpG-oligodesoxynucleotide 1668 thioate (20 nmol/kg bodyweight, 30 min after D-galactosamin desensitization) signaling via TLR9. Hemodynamic measurements and organ preservation were performed 6 h after stimulation. Indeed, the study revealed a robust enhancement of LTA induced pattern recognition receptor and cytokine mRNA expression and a LTA-dependent reduction of hemodynamic pressure in TAC wild type mice. Second-Hit treatment with CpG-ODNs led to similar results. However, second-hit effects were abolished in Tlr4-/- mice. In total, these data indicate for the first time that cardiac stress increases the inflammatory response towards both, gram-negative and gram-positive, TLR ligands as well as bacterial DNA. The decrease of the inflammatory response upon TLR2 and -9 ligand challenge in TAC Tlr4-/- mice demonstrates that a lack of TLR4 signaling does not only prevent left ventricular hypertrophy but also protects the mice from a cardiac stress induced hyperinflammatory reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2260645037,"The gelatinases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, are thought to be key mediators of secondary damage in adult animal models of brain injury. Moreover, an acute increase in these proteases in plasma and brain extracellular fluid of adult patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and mortality. Nonetheless, their involvement after TBI in the pediatric brain remains understudied. Using a murine model of TBI at postnatal day 21 (p21), approximating a toddler-aged child, we saw upregulation of active and pro-MMP-9 and MMP-2 by gelatin zymography at 48 h post-injury. We therefore investigated the role of gelatinases on long-term structural and behavioral outcomes after injury after acute inhibition with a selective gelatinase inhibitor, p-OH SB-3CT. After systemic administration, p-OH SB-3CT crossed the blood-brain barrier at therapeutically-relevant concentrations. TBI at p21 induced hyperactivity, deficits in spatial learning and memory, and reduced sociability when mice were assessed at adulthood, alongside pronounced tissue loss in key neuroanatomical regions. Acute and short-term post-injury treatment with p-OH SB-3CT did not ameliorate these long-term behavioral, cognitive, or neuropathological deficits as compared to vehicle-treated controls, suggesting that these deficits were independent of MMP-9 and MMP-2 upregulation. These findings emphasize the vulnerability of the immature brain to the consequences of traumatic injuries. However, early upregulation of gelatinases do not appear to be key determinants of long-term recovery after an early-life injury."
https://openalex.org/W2179982145,"Recognition of personally familiar voices benefits from the concurrent presentation of the corresponding speakers' faces. This effect of audiovisual integration is most pronounced for voices combined with dynamic articulating faces. However, it is unclear if learning unfamiliar voices also benefits from audiovisual face-voice integration or, alternatively, is hampered by attentional capture of faces, i.e., ""face-overshadowing"". In six study-test cycles we compared the recognition of newly-learned voices following unimodal voice learning vs. bimodal face-voice learning with either static (Exp. 1) or dynamic articulating faces (Exp. 2). Voice recognition accuracies significantly increased for bimodal learning across study-test cycles while remaining stable for unimodal learning, as reflected in numerical costs of bimodal relative to unimodal voice learning in the first two study-test cycles and benefits in the last two cycles. This was independent of whether faces were static images (Exp. 1) or dynamic videos (Exp. 2). In both experiments, slower reaction times to voices previously studied with faces compared to voices only may result from visual search for faces during memory retrieval. A general decrease of reaction times across study-test cycles suggests facilitated recognition with more speaker repetitions. Overall, our data suggest two simultaneous and opposing mechanisms during bimodal face-voice learning: while attentional capture of faces may initially impede voice learning, audiovisual integration may facilitate it thereafter."

To improve our understanding of this disease, we developed and characterized a patient-derived xenograft model by subcutaneous transplantation of pieces of human uterine fibroid tissue into three different strains of severe combined immunodeficient mice. Engrafted uterine fibroid tissue preserved the classical morphology with interwoven bundles of smooth muscle cells and an abundant deposition of collagenous matrix, similar to uterine fibroids in situ. The grafts expressed both estrogen receptor 1 and progesterone receptor. Additionally, both receptors were up-regulated by estrogen treatment. Growth of the fibroid grafts was dependent on 17β-estradiol and progesterone supplementation at levels similar to women with the disease and was studied for up to 60 days at maximum. Co-treatment with the antiprogestin mifepristone reduced graft growth (four independent donors, p<0.0001 two-sided t-test), as did treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (three independent donors, p<0.0001 two-sided t-test). This in vivo animal model preserves the main histological and functional characteristics of human uterine fibroids, is amenable to intervention by pharmacological treatment, and can thus serve as an adequate model for the development of novel therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2178714458,"Aberrant chromatin regulation is a frequent driver of leukemogenesis. Mutations in chromatin regulators often result in more stem-like cells that seed a bulk leukemic population. Inhibitors targeting these proteins represent an emerging class of therapeutics, and identifying further chromatin regulators that promote disease progression may result in additional drug targets. We identified the chromatin-modifying protein CHD8 as necessary for cell survival in a mouse model of BCR-Abl+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This disease has a poor prognosis despite treatment with kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-Abl. Although implicated as a risk factor in autism spectrum disorder and a tumor suppressor in prostate and lung cancer, the mechanism of CHD8’s activity is still unclear and has never been studied in the context of hematopoietic malignancies. Here we demonstrate that depletion of CHD8 in B-ALL cells leads to cell death. While multiple B cell malignancies were dependent on CHD8 expression for survival, T cell malignancies displayed milder phenotypes upon CHD8 knockdown. In addition, ectopic expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain in a T cell malignancy partially alleviated the detrimental effect of CHD8 depletion. Our results demonstrate that CHD8 has a context-dependent role in cell survival, and its inhibition may be an effective treatment for B lymphoid malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2175475176,"The bacterium Treponema pallidum is known to cause syphilis (ssp. pallidum), yaws (ssp. pertenue), and endemic syphilis (ssp. endemicum) in humans. Nonhuman primates have also been reported to be infected with the bacterium with equally versatile clinical manifestations, from severe skin ulcerations to asymptomatic. At present all simian strains are closely related to human yaws-causing strains, an important consideration for yaws eradication. We tested clinically healthy Guinea baboons (Papio papio) at Parc National Niokolo Koba in south eastern Senegal for the presence of anti-T. pallidum antibodies. Since T. pallidum infection in this species was identified 50 years ago, and there has been no attempt to treat non-human primates for infection, it was hypothesized that a large number of West African baboons are still infected with simian strains of the yaws-bacterium. All animals were without clinical signs of treponematoses, but 18 of 20 (90%) baboons tested positive for antibodies against T. pallidum based on treponemal tests. Yet, Guinea baboons seem to develop no clinical symptoms, though it must be assumed that infection is chronic or comparable to the latent stage in human yaws infection. The non-active character is supported by the low anti-T. pallidum serum titers in Guinea baboons (median = 1:2,560) versus serum titers that are found in genital-ulcerated olive baboons with active infection in Tanzania (range of medians among the groups of initial, moderate, and severe infected animals = 1:15,360 to 1:2.097e+7). Our findings provide evidence for simian infection with T. pallidum in wild Senegalese baboons. Potentially, Guinea baboons in West Africa serve as a natural reservoir for human infection, as the West African simian strain has been shown to cause sustainable yaws infection when inoculated into humans. The present study pinpoints an area where further research is needed to support the currently on-going second WHO led yaws eradication campaign with its goal to eradicate yaws by 2020."
https://openalex.org/W2254251556,"Fifteen triads of unacquainted men conversed for ten minutes while stress was measured in real time by pulse rate and thumb blood volume (TBV). Salivary measures of testosterone (T), cortisol (C), and the stress-related enzyme alpha-amylase (AA) were measured at the beginning and end of the session. Fully or partially transitive status hierarchies formed in 14 triads. (Highest ranked man was scored 1, lowest 3, with ties allowed.) Ten of the triads participated in Study 1, where nothing was at stake in the casual conversation. Five additional triads were run in Study 2, intended to introduce competition by offering a $20 reward to the man afterward chosen as having led the conversation. Most results from the two studies are similar, suggesting that the $20 reward had little effect. Combining studies, pulse and TBV show that conversation is more stressful than watching a video beforehand. Within the conversation, speaking turns are more stressful than listening turns, especially among the lowest ranked men, less so among those higher in rank. This supports a stress-based mechanism for status allocation among humans. Apparently, human speech is a form of status signaling, homologous with nonlinguistic status signals used by other primates, as posited by the “biosocial model.” The biosocial model also posits that a physiological substrate (T, C, and AA) is related to dominance or status. Predicted effects are not replicated here, except for an inverse relationship between the stress enzyme AA and status. The mostly null results, obtained from conversations where there was little or nothing at stake, suggest that T and C (and their interaction) are not relevant to emergent status in the absence of serious competition."
https://openalex.org/W2286402846,"Understanding function and specificity of de-ubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) is a major goal of current research, since DUBs are key regulators of ubiquitylation events and have been shown to be mutated in human diseases. Most DUBs are cysteine proteases, relying on a catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine and aspartate to cleave the isopeptide bond between two ubiquitin units in a poly-ubiquitin chain. We have discovered that the two Drosophila melanogaster homologues of human OTUD4, CG3251 and Otu, contain a serine instead of a cysteine in the catalytic OTU (ovarian tumor) domain. DUBs that are serine proteases instead of cysteine- or metallo-proteases have not been described. In line with this, neither CG3251 nor Otu protein were active to cleave ubiquitin chains. Re-introduction of a cysteine in the catalytic center did not render the enzymes active, indicating that further critical features for ubiquitin binding or cleavage have been lost in these proteins. Sequence analysis of OTUD4 homologues from various other species showed that within this OTU subfamily, loss of the catalytic cysteine has occurred frequently in presumably independent events, as well as gene duplications or triplications, suggesting DUB-independent functions of OTUD4 proteins. Using an in vivo RNAi approach, we show that CG3251 might function in the regulation of Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP)-antagonist-induced apoptosis, presumably in a DUB-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2172877277,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) binds to its cognate receptor TrkA and induces neuronal differentiation by activating distinct downstream signal transduction events. RabGEF1 (also known as Rabex-5) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5, which regulates early endosome fusion and vesicular trafficking in endocytic pathways. Here, we used the antisense (AS) expression approach to induce an NGF-dependent sustained knockdown of RabGEF1 protein expression in stable PC12 transfectants. We show that RabGEF1 is a negative regulator of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and modulates other cellular and signaling processes that are activated by the interaction of NGF with TrkA receptors, such as cell cycle progression, cessation of proliferation, and activation of NGF-mediated downstream signaling responses. Moreover, RabGEF1 can bind to Rac1, and the activation of Rac1 upon NGF treatment is significantly enhanced in AS transfectants, suggesting that RabGEF1 is a negative regulator of NGF-induced Rac1 activation in PC12 cells. Furthermore, we show that RabGEF1 can also interact with NMDA receptors by binding to the NR2B subunit and its associated binding partner SynGAP, and negatively regulates activation of nitric oxide synthase activity induced by NMDA receptor stimulation in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. Our data suggest that RabGEF1 is a negative regulator of TrkA-dependent neuronal differentiation and of NMDA receptor-mediated signaling activation in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2180308584,"Evidence from previous studies suggests that the male reproductive system can be disrupted by fetal or neonatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES). However, the molecular basis for this effect remains unclear. To evaluate the effects of DES on mouse spermatocytes and to explore its potential mechanism of action, the levels of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and DNA methylation induced by DES were detected. The results showed that low doses of DES inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in GC-2 cells, an immortalized mouse pachytene spermatocyte-derived cell line, which reproduces primary cells responses to E2. Furthermore, global DNA methylation levels were increased and the expression levels of DNMTs were altered in DES-treated GC-2 cells. A total of 141 differentially methylated DNA sites were detected by microarray analysis. Rxra, an important component of the retinoic acid signaling pathway, and mybph, a RhoA pathway-related protein, were found to be hypermethylated, and Prkcd, an apoptosis-related protein, was hypomethylated. These results showed that low-dose DES was toxic to spermatocytes and that DNMT expression and DNA methylation were altered in DES-exposed cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that DNA methylation likely plays an important role in mediating DES-induced spermatocyte toxicity in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2180815296,"Equine influenza viruses (EIV)—H3N8 continue to circulate in equine population throughout the world. They evolve by the process of antigenic drift that leads to substantial change in the antigenicity of the virus, thereby necessitating substitution of virus strain in the vaccines. This requires frequent testing of the new vaccines in the in vivo system; however, lack of an appropriate laboratory animal challenge model for testing protective efficacy of equine influenza vaccine candidates hinders the screening of new vaccines and other therapeutic approaches. In the present investigation, BALB/c mouse were explored for suitability for conducting pathogenecity studies for EIV. The BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally @ 2×106.24 EID50 with EIV (H3N8) belonging to Clade 2 of Florida sublineage and monitored for setting up of infection and associated parameters. All mice inoculated with EIV exhibited clinical signs viz. loss in body weights, lethargy, dyspnea, etc, between 3 and 5 days which commensurate with lesions observed in the respiratory tract including rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, alveolitis and diffuse interstitial pneumonia. Transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, virus quantification through titration and qRT-PCR demonstrated active viral infection in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Serology revealed rise in serum lactate dehydrogenase levels along with sero-conversion. The pattern of disease progression, pathological lesions and virus recovery from nasal washings and lungs in the present investigations in mice were comparable to natural and experimental EIV infection in equines. The findings establish BALB/c mice as small animal model for studying EIV (H3N8) infection and will have immense potential for dissecting viral pathogenesis, vaccine efficacy studies, preliminary screening of vaccine candidates and antiviral therapeutics against EIV."
https://openalex.org/W2249819547,"Chromosomal translocations are driver mutations of human cancers, particularly leukemias. They define disease subtypes and are used as prognostic markers, for minimal residual disease monitoring and therapeutic targets. Due to their low incidence, several translocations and their biological consequences remain poorly characterized. To address this, we engineered mouse strains that conditionally express E2A-HLF, a fusion oncogene from the translocation t(17;19) associated with 1% of pediatric B-cell precursor ALL. Conditional oncogene activation and expression were directed to the B-cell compartment by the Cre driver promoters CD19 or Mb1 (Igα, CD79a), or to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment by the Mx1 promoter. E2A-HLF expression in B-cell progenitors induced hyposplenia and lymphopenia, whereas expression in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells was embryonic lethal. Increased cell death was detected in E2A-HLF expressing cells, suggesting the need for cooperating genetic events that suppress cell death for B-cell oncogenic transformation. E2A-HLF/Mb1.Cre aged mice developed a fatal myeloproliferative-like disorder with low frequency characterized by leukocytosis, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly and organ-infiltration by mature myelocytes. In conclusion, we have developed conditional E2A-HLF knock-in mice, which provide an experimental platform to study cooperating genetic events and further elucidate translational biology in cross-species comparative studies."
https://openalex.org/W2277026138,"We have analyzed monthly hydrological, meteorological and water quality data from three irrigation and drinking water reservoirs in the lower Jordan River basin and estimated the atmospheric emission rates of CO2. The data were collected between 2006 and 2013 and show that the reservoirs, which differ in size and age, were net sources of CO2. The estimated surface fluxes were comparable in magnitude to those reported for hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropical and sub-tropical zones. Highest emission rates were observed for a newly established reservoir, which was initially filled during the sampling period. In the two older reservoirs, CO2 partial pressures and fluxes were significantly decreasing during the observation period, which could be related to simultaneously occurring temporal trends in water residence time and chemical composition of the water. The results indicate a strong influence of water and reservoir management (e.g. water consumption) on CO2 emission rates, which is affected by the increasing anthropogenic pressure on the limited water resources in the study area. The low wind speed and relatively high pH favored chemical enhancement of the CO2 gas exchange at the reservoir surfaces, which caused on average a four-fold enhancement of the fluxes. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the uncertainty of the estimated fluxes is, besides pH, mainly affected by the poorly resolved wind speed and resulting uncertainty of the chemical enhancement factor."
https://openalex.org/W2180046792,"Effective surveillance and management of pathogenic Escherichia coli relies on robust and reproducible typing methods such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Typing of E. coli by MLST enables tracking of pathogenic clones that are known to carry virulence factors or spread resistance, such as the globally-prevalent ST131 lineage. Standard MLST for E. coli requires sequencing of seven alleles, or a whole genome, and can take several days. Here, we have developed and validated a nucleic-acid-based MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) method for MLST as a rapid alternative to sequencing that requires minimal operator expertise. Identification of alleles was 99.6% concordant with sequencing. We employed MLST by MALDI-TOF MS to investigate diversity among 62 E. coli isolates from Sydney, Australia, carrying a blaCMY-2-like gene on an IncI1 plasmid to determine whether any dominant clonal lineages are associated with the spread of this globally-disseminated resistance gene. Thirty-four known sequence types were identified, including lineages associated with human disease, animal and environmental sources. This suggests that the dissemination of blaCMY-2-like-genes is more complex than the simple spread of successful pathogenic clones. E. coli MLST by MALDI-TOF MS, employed here for the first time, can be utilised as an automated tool for large-scale population analyses or for targeted screening for known high-risk clones in a diagnostic setting."
https://openalex.org/W2285411098,"Binding of human α-Synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson’s disease, to natural membranes is thought to be crucial in relation to its pathological and physiological function. Here the binding of αS to small unilamellar vesicles mimicking the inner mitochondrial and the neuronal plasma membrane is studied in situ by continuous wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance. Local binding information of αS spin labeled by MTSL at positions 56 and 69 respectively shows that also helix 2 (residues 50–100) binds firmly to both membranes. By double electron-electron resonance (DEER) on the mutant spin labeled at positions 27 and 56 (αS 27/56) a new conformation on the membrane is found with a distance of 3.6 nm/ 3.7 nm between residues 27 and 56. In view of the low negative charge density of these membranes, the strong interaction is surprising, emphasizing that function and pathology of αS could involve synaptic vesicles and mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2176121763,"Cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) is a prognostic indicator of recurrence and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following radical resection. To investigate the role of CK-19 in assessment of early recurrence and prognosis in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC following radical resection. In total, 235 patients with HBV-related HCC (age, 15–82 years; mean age, 54 ± 10 years) undergoing radical resection were screened for inclusion from January 2005 to December 2010. Malignant tissues and adjacent non-malignant tissues were sampled during surgery, and CK-19 and Ki-67 expression was determined by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. CK-19 mRNA levels in 30 randomly selected frozen HCC specimens were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from January 2011 to June 2011. Correlations of CK-19 and Ki-67 expression with tumor recurrence, metastasis, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Elevated CK-19 expression was correlated with early recurrence (P = 0.001), shorter DFS (P = 0.001), and reduced OS (P = 0.010). CK-19 expression was correlated with the Ki-67 index (P = 0.037), histological differentiation (P = 0.016), focal number (P = 0.044), and blood vessel tumor embolism (P = 0.002). Patients with metastasis within 1 year exhibited stronger CK-19 expression than did patients without metastasis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, early recurrence was associated with elevated CK-19 mRNA levels (χ2 = 5.761, P = 0.016).When confirmed by a low alpha-fetoprotein concentration (<400 μg/L), CK-19 expression in surgical biopsy specimens taken from patients with HCC during radical resection is an additional valuable indicator of early recurrence, distant metastasis, and poor prognosis in HBV-positive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2173780872,"The effects of exposed pipe encasements on the local variation of hydrodynamic and sediment conditions in a river channel are examined. Laboratory experiments are performed to assess the response of water level, flow regime and bed deformation to several representative types of concrete encasements. The experimental conditions considered are: three types of exposed pipe encasements exposed on the bed, including trapezoidal shape, circular-arc shape and polygonal shape, and three sets of discharges, including annual discharge, once-in-3-year flood, and once-in-50-year flood. Our experiments show that: (1) the amount of backwater definitely depends on the encasement geometric shape and the background discharge; (2) smaller discharges generally tend to induce local scour of river bed downstream of the encasement, and the order of sensitivity of bed deformation to the encasement geometric shape is trapezoidal > circular-arc > polygonal; (3) comparatively speaking, the polygonal encasement may be considered as a suitable protective structure for pipelines across alluvial rivers, with relatively modest effects on the local hydrodynamic conditions and bed stabilization."
