https://openalex.org/W1973659906,"Although several genetic and biochemical factors are associated with the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration, it has yet to be determined how these different impairments can cause similar degenerative phenotypes. Here, we report microglial/macrophage activation in both a Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration mouse model caused by delayed clearance of all-trans-retinal from the retina, and in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model with impaired retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) phagocytosis. Mouse microglia displayed RPE cytotoxicity and increased production of inflammatory chemokines/cytokines, Ccl2, Il1b, and Tnf, after coincubation with ligands that activate innate immunity. Notably, phagocytosis of photoreceptor proteins increased the activation of microglia/macrophages and RPE cells isolated from model mice as well as wild-type mice. The mRNA levels of Tlr2 and Tlr4, which can recognize proteins as their ligands, were elevated in mice with retinal degeneration. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from Tlr4-deficient mice did not increase Ccl2 after coincubation with photoreceptor proteins. Tlr4−/−Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice displayed milder retinal degenerative phenotypes than Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice. Additionally, inactivation of microglia/macrophages by pharmacological approaches attenuated mouse retinal degeneration. This study demonstrates an important contribution of TLR4-mediated microglial activation by endogenous photoreceptor proteins in retinal inflammation that aggravates retinal cell death. This pathway is likely to represent an underlying common pathology in degenerative retinal disorders.Background: The host inflammatory response can contribute to the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration.Results: Photoreceptor proteins in degenerating retinas can activate microglial cells through Toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4).Conclusion: Microglial activation can be a common pathology of retinal degeneration.Significance: Modulating microglial activation is a potential treatment strategy for human retinal degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa.

Significance: Modulating microglial activation is a potential treatment strategy for human retinal degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Many neurodegenerative diseases, including retinal degeneration, are associated with genetic mutations, most of which are found in completely unrelated genes. Although these diseases can result from different biological and biochemical impairments, clinical assessments show many similarities. Defining these similarities offers hope in discovering therapeutic interventions with broad applicability. Major retinal degenerative diseases include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 4The abbreviations used are: AMD, age-related macular degeneration; atRAL, all-trans-retinal; ABCA4, ATP-binding cassette transporter 4; AF, autofluorescent; BRB, blood-retinal barrier; CFH, complement factor H; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; Mertk, c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase; POS, photoreceptor outer segments; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; RP, retinitis pigmentosa; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; SD-OCT, spectral-domain optic coherence tomography; SLO, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; TLR, Toll-like receptor; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Vegfa, vascular endothelial growth factor A; ConA, concanavalin A; ONL, outer nuclear layers; DCF-DA, dichlorofluorescein diacetate; PFOA, perfluorooctanoic acid; BM, bone marrow; qRT, quantitative RT.

The aging retina, as well as the brain, show features of low-grade chronic inflammation, recently termed para-inflammation (8Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3892) Google Scholar, 9Xu H. Chen M. Forrester J.V. Para-inflammation in the aging retina.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2009; 28: 348-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). This state can evolve into clinical pathologies including retinal degeneration and Alzheimer disease. Characteristic features of retinal para-inflammation are microglial activation and complement deposition. Retinal macrophages are subdivided into tissue-resident microglia in the inner retina, and peripheral macrophages that migrate to this site from local blood vessels (10Joly S. Francke M. Ulbricht E.

Histological studies suggest that macrophages are the predominant infiltrating cells in the retinas of patients with AMD (9Xu H. Chen M. Forrester J.V. Para-inflammation in the aging retina.Prog.

Complement dysregulation has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of Stargardt disease (13Radu R.A. Hu J. Yuan Q. Welch D.L. Makshanoff J. Lloyd M. McMullen S. Travis G.H. Bok D.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Excessive all-trans-retinal (atRAL) accumulation after light exposure can cause retinal toxicity because it is a reactive aldehyde. ABCA4 and retinol dehydrogenase 8 (RDH8) are the visual cycle proteins involved in clearance of atRAL from the retina (15Maeda A. Golczak M. Chen Y. Okano K. Kohno H. Shiose S. Ishikawa K. Harte W. Palczewska G. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Primary amines protect against retinal degeneration in mouse models of retinopathies.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 170-178Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mouse features an AMD-like retinal phenotype that includes lipofuscin accumulation, drusen formation, and photoreceptor/RPE atrophy followed by choroidal neovascularization (16Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K. Retinopathy in mice induced by disrupted all-trans-retinal clearance.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26684-26693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This phenotype is exacerbated by light exposure, which causes acute retinal degeneration (17Shiose S. Chen Y. Okano K. Roy S. Kohno H. Tang J. Pearlman E. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Maeda A. Toll-like receptor 3 is required for development of retinopathy caused by impaired all-trans-retinal clearance in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15543-15555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, genetic ablation of Toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice, yielding Tlr3−/−Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice, attenuated the severity of this retinal degeneration (18Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. Dual-substrate specificity short chain retinol dehydrogenases from the vertebrate retina.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that immunological mechanisms participate in the pathology of atRAL-associated retinal degeneration. Here, we investigated retinal degenerative events in two mouse models, Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice that exhibit light-induced and age-related retinal degeneration and RP-like retinal degeneration in c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase-deficient (Mertk−/−) mice, which are unable to conduct RPE phagocytosis (15Maeda A. Golczak M. Chen Y. Okano K. Kohno H. Shiose S. Ishikawa K. Harte W. Palczewska G. Maeda T. Palczewski K. Primary amines protect against retinal degeneration in mouse models of retinopathies.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 170-178Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Subretinal accumulation of microglia/macrophages accompanied by other inflammatory changes was observed in both models. Release of dying photoreceptor cell proteins increased expression of Tlr2 and Tlr4, which stimulated the activation of microglia and RPE cells. Furthermore, Tlr4 deficiency and microglial inactivation by minocycline attenuated retinal degeneration in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice. These observations indicate that microglial activation by endogenous retinal proteins arising from injured photoreceptors plays an important role in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration. Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice were generated as described previously, and all mice were genotyped by an established method (16Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Palczewski K.

Mertk−/− mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Tlr4−/− mice were obtained from Dr. S. Akira (Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Japan). Genotyping for Tlr4 was performed with primers: TLR4-WT, 5′-CAAGATCAACCGATGGACGTGTAAAC-3′; TLR4-common, 5′-CTTGTTGCCCTTCAGTCACAGAGAC-3′; TLR4-KO, 5′-GTTGGGTCGTTTGTTCGGATCCGTC-3′. C57BL/6 or littermates of mutant mice were used as controls. Equal numbers of males and females were employed. All mice were housed in the animal facility at the School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, where they were maintained either under complete darkness or in a 12-h light (∼10 lux)/12-h dark cycle environment. Experimental manipulations in the dark were done under dim red light transmitted through a Kodak No. 1 safelight filter (transmittance >560 nm). All animal procedures and experiments were approved by the Case Western Reserve University Animal Care Committees and conformed to recommendations of both the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Mice were dark-adapted for 48 h before their exposure to light. Light damage was induced by exposing mice to 10,000 lux of diffuse white fluorescent light (150 W spiral lamp; Commercial Electric, Cleveland, OH) for 30 min. Before such light exposure, pupils of mice were dilated with mixture of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (Midorin-P®, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). After exposure animals were kept in the dark until evaluation. All procedures to create sections for immunohistochemistry and light microscopy were performed by established methods (18Haeseleer F.

The following antibodies (Abs) were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC): rabbit anti-Iba1 Ab (1:400, Wako, Chuo-ku, Osaka, Japan), rat anti-mouse F4/80 Ab (1:100, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC), rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein Ab (GFAP; 1:400, Dako, Carpinteria, CA), mouse anti-rhodopsin 1D4 Ab (1:100, gift from Dr. Robert Molday, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada), Alexa 488-conjugated peanut agglutinin (1:200, Invitrogen), mouse anti-MHC class II Ab (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and rabbit anti-C3 Ab (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). HRAII (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) for SLO and SD-OCT (EnvisuTM C-Class SDOIS, Bioptigen, Research Triangle Park, NC) were employed for in vivo imaging of mouse retinas. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection using a mixture (20 μl/g of body weight) containing ketamine (6 mg/ml) and xylazine (0.44 mg/ml) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and 100 mm NaCl. Pupils were dilated with a mixture of 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (Midorin-P, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.). Five pictures acquired in the B-scan mode were used to construct each final averaged SD-OCT image. SD-OCT images were scored using our previously established scoring system (15Maeda A. Golczak M.

Biol. 2012; 8: 170-178Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Radial incisions were made in enucleated eyecups and the vitreous was removed completely to produce flat mount retinas. RPE flat mounts were prepared by peeling the retina away from the eyecup. For immunostaining, flat mount retina or RPE was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h. After fixation, the sample was washed in PBST buffer (136 mm NaCl, 11.4 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature (RT) and then placed on a coated slide (Superfrost Plus®, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The mounted sample was air-dried 2 h at RT and then blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBST for 3 h. Retinal samples from each group were collected from 16 eye balls. Total RNA was isolated using a RiboPure Kit (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScriptTM II Reserve Transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR amplification was performed using iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Primers were designed using web tool Primer 3 and synthesized by Eurofins MWG Operon (Hunstville, AL). qRT-PCR analyses were performed with the following primers: Ccl2 (187 bp), forward 5′-GCTGACCCCAAGAAGGAATG-3′, reverse 5′-GTGCTTGAGGTGGTTGTGGA-3′; Ccr2 (227 bp), forward 5′-ATTCTCCACACCCTGTTTCG-3′, reverse 5′-ATGCAGCAGTGTGTCATTCC-3′; Ccl12 (188 bp), forward 5′-CAGTCCTCAGGTATTGGCTGGA-3′, reverse 5′-TCCTTGGGGTCAGCACAGAT-3′; Cx3cr1 (202 bp), forward 5′-CACCATTAGTCTGGGCGTCT-3′, reverse 5′-GATGCGGAAGTAGCAAAAGC-3′; Il1β (167 bp), forward 5′-CCTGCAGCTGGAGAGTGTGG-3′, reverse 5′-CCAGGAAGACAGGCTTGTGC-3′; Tnf-R (102 bp), forward 5′-GGTTCCTTTGTGGCACTTG-3′, reverse 5′-TTCTCTTGGTGACCGGGAG-3′; C3 (190 bp), forward 5′-GACCAAGTGCCAGACACAGA-3′, reverse 5′-CGGTCTGGTCCAGGTAGTGT-3′; Cfh (163 bp), forward 5′-TGGACTTCCTTGTGGACCTC-3′, reverse 5′-TGGGTCAGACCACTTTCCTC-3′; Vegfa (86 bp), forward 5′-AGCACAGCAGATGTGAATGC-3′, reverse 5′-AATGCTTTCTCCGCTCTGAA-3′; C-reactive protein (Crp, 194 bp) forward 5′-TCTGCACAAGGGCTACACTG-3′, reverse 5′-AAACATTGGGGCTGAGTGTC-3′; Pyrimidinergic receptor P2Y, G-protein coupled, 6 (P2ry6, 187 bp) forward 5′-CATTAGCTTCCAGCGCTACC-3′, reverse 5′-GCTCAGGTCGTAGCACACAG-3′; Arginase, liver (Arg1, 181 bp) forward 5′-CGCCTTTCTCAAAAGGACAG-3′, reverse 5′-ACAGACCGTGGGTTCTTCAC-3′; Transforming growth factor, β1 (Tgfb, 185 bp) forward 5′-TGAGTGGCTGTCTTTTGACG-3′, reverse 5′-GGTTCATGTCATGGATGGTG-3′; Tlr2 (241 bp) forward 5′-TGGTTCTTTTCCCAAACTGG-3′, reverse 5′-GAGAAGGGCACAGCAGACTC-3′; Tlr4 (154 bp) forward 5′-GTGGCCCTACCAAGTCTCAG-3′, reverse 5′-GACCCATGAAATTGGCACTC-3′. Relative expression of genes was normalized to the housekeeping gene Gapdh. Production of Ccl2, Il1β, and Tnf was quantified by ELISA kits (Ccl2; MEJ00, Il1β; MLB00C, Tnf; MTA00B) purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) with 50 μl of cell culture supernatants. Concentrated cell lysates were prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Then the protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Primary mouse RPE cells, retinal microglial cells, and bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages were prepared from 2-week-old mice based on previously published methods (20Ma W. Zhao L. Fontainhas A.M.

Enucleated eyes were incubated with 2% dispase (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C, and neural retinas and eyecups were separated under a surgical microscope (ILLUMIN-i, Endure Medical, Cumming, GA). The RPE layer was peeled from eyecups, passed through 70- and 40-μm nylon mesh filters (Falcon Plastics, Brookings, SD), and cultured in DMEM containing minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 10% fetal bovine serum. To enrich microglial cells, neural retinas were homogenized and cultured in DMEM containing minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 7 days at 37 °C. Adherent cells to the plastic surface were treated with 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen), and less adhesive cells were collected as microglial cells. BM cells were collected from femurs and tibias and were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 30% L929-conditioned medium for 7–10 days to differentiate them into macrophages. Homogeneity of these cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry with anti-Iba1 and anti-F4/80 Abs for microglia/macrophages, and anti-Zo-1, anti-RPE65, and anti-LRAT Abs for RPE cells. RT-PCR was conducted to check expression of RPE-specific proteins with the following primers: Rpe65 (561 bp), forward 5′-CAATTGACAAGGTCGACACAG-3′, reverse 5′-CATCTCTGGAATATGTTCAGG-3′; Lrat (334 bp), forward 5′-CARCCTAGTCAATCACCTAGAC-3′, reverse 5′-CTAGCCAGACATCATCCACAAG-3′; rhodopsin (562 bp), forward 5′-ATGAACGGCACAGAGGGCCC-3′, reverse 5′-CGCATGAACATTGCATGCCCTC-3′. POS membranes were prepared from 4-week-old Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− and WT mice using a published method (23Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Palczewski K. Engel A. Organization of the G protein-coupled receptors rhodopsin and opsin in native membranes.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21655-21662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Fifteen to 20 animals were used for each preparation. AtRAL was purchased from Sigma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Pam3CSK4 were purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). To remove DNA and RNA from POS, 125 units of benzonase (Sigma) was incubated with 30 μg of POS for 30 min at 37 °C. Lipase at 2.5 units (Sigma) was added and mixed with 30 μg of POS, and then incubated 60 min at 37 °C to degrade POS lipids. Endotoxin levels in prepared POS were measured using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from dead cells into the culture supernatants was measured after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C with an LDH assay kit from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). The percentage of cytotoxicity was calculated as [(test sample − cell negative control)/(lysis control − cell negative control)] × 100. Production of ROS was examined by using the fluorescent ROS probe DCF-DA purchased from Sigma. After a 24-h incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, including 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and then 0.25 μm DCF-DA was co-incubated for 30 min. After washing twice with PBS, images of the ROS signal were obtained with a Leica DMI 6000B inverted microscope. Fluorescence intensity was measured with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) or MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) software. Minocycline was purchased from Sigma. Primary RPE, retinal microglia, or BM-derived macrophages were co-incubated with 30 μg/ml of minocycline at 37 °C for 24 h to determine the effects of cellular minocycline. For in vivo evaluation, mice were administrated an intraperitoneal injection of minocycline (0, 4, 50, and 100 mg/kg) daily from 1 day before to 7 days after light exposure. Data representing the mean ± S.D. for the results of at least three independent experiments were compared by the one-way analysis of variance test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Delay in atRAL clearance after light exposure in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice causes acute photoreceptor apoptosis (24Maeda A. Maeda T. Golczak M. Chou S. Desai A. Hoppel C.L. Matsuyama S. Palczewski K. Involvement of all-trans-retinal in acute light-induced retinopathy of mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 15173-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To identify additional retinal degenerative symptoms associated with light-induced photoreceptor death, 4-week-old Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice were exposed to light at 10,000 lux for 30 min, and in vivo SLO imaging was performed. Accumulation of autofluorescent (AF) spots were detected in retinas of light-exposed Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice (Fig. 1A). This accumulation became evident at 3 days and peaked 7 days after light exposure (Fig. 1A, right panel). RPE/choroid flat mounts were examined to characterize the localization of these AF spots. Cellular infiltration was observed on the apical side of the RPE where the RPE and POS form junctions. AF spots and infiltrated cells appeared similar in size, and these cells were stained with Abs for Iba-1, a microglia marker and F4/80, a macrophage marker (Fig. 1B). The fact that these Iba-1- and F4/80-positive cells evidenced extensive pseudopodia, short microvilli, and lamellipodia indicates that these cells were activated forms of microglia/macrophages (25Chen M. Forrester J.V. Xu H.

Translocation of Iba-1-positive cells from the inner retina to the subretinal space was detected in light-exposed Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that AF spots detected by SLO in light-exposed Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice are caused by infiltrating microglia/macrophages into the subretinal space. To determine whether the increased numbers of microglia/macrophages in Abca4−/−Rdh8−/− mice correlate with increased expression of genes associated with retinal inflammation, we examined expression of proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines using qRT-PCR. These genes included chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2/Mcp-1) (25Chen M. Forrester J.V. Xu H.

https://openalex.org/W1986852869,"Monocytic lineage cells (monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells) play important roles in immune responses and are involved in various pathological conditions. The development of monocytic cells from human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is of particular interest because it provides an unlimited cell source for clinical application and basic research on disease pathology. Although the methods for monocytic cell differentiation from ESCs/iPSCs using embryonic body or feeder co-culture systems have already been established, these methods depend on the use of xenogeneic materials and, therefore, have a relatively poor-reproducibility. Here, we established a robust and highly-efficient method to differentiate functional monocytic cells from ESCs/iPSCs under serum- and feeder cell-free conditions. This method produced 1.3 × 10(6) ± 0.3 × 10(6) floating monocytes from approximately 30 clusters of ESCs/iPSCs 5-6 times per course of differentiation. Such monocytes could be differentiated into functional macrophages and dendritic cells. This method should be useful for regenerative medicine, disease-specific iPSC studies and drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1993460344,"The carboxysome is a bacterial organelle found in all cyanobacteria; it encapsulates CO2 fixation enzymes within a protein shell. The most abundant carboxysome shell protein contains a single bacterial microcompartment (BMC) domain. We present in vivo evidence that a hypothetical protein (dubbed CcmP) encoded in all β-cyanobacterial genomes is part of the carboxysome. We show that CcmP is a tandem BMC domain protein, the first to be structurally characterized from a β-carboxysome. CcmP forms a dimer of tightly stacked trimers, resulting in a nanocompartment-containing shell protein that may weakly bind 3-phosphoglycerate, the product of CO2 fixation. The trimers have a large central pore through which metabolites presumably pass into the carboxysome. Conserved residues surrounding the pore have alternate side-chain conformations suggesting that it can be open or closed. Furthermore, CcmP and its orthologs in α-cyanobacterial genomes form a distinct clade of shell proteins. Members of this subgroup are also found in numerous heterotrophic BMC-associated gene clusters encoding functionally diverse bacterial organelles, suggesting that the potential to form a nanocompartment within a microcompartment shell is widespread. Given that carboxysomes and architecturally related bacterial organelles are the subject of intense interest for applications in synthetic biology/metabolic engineering, our results describe a new type of building block with which to functionalize BMC shells."
https://openalex.org/W2028538629,"Marine reserves are an effective tool for protecting biodiversity locally, with potential economic benefits including enhancement of local fisheries, increased tourism, and maintenance of ecosystem services. However, fishing communities often fear short-term income losses associated with closures, and thus may oppose marine reserves. Here we review empirical data and develop bioeconomic models to show that the value of marine reserves (enhanced adjacent fishing + tourism) may often exceed the pre-reserve value, and that economic benefits can offset the costs in as little as five years. These results suggest the need for a new business model for creating and managing reserves, which could pay for themselves and turn a profit for stakeholder groups. Our model could be expanded to include ecosystem services and other benefits, and it provides a general framework to estimate costs and benefits of reserves and to develop such business models."
https://openalex.org/W2159762127,"Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are Ca2+ sensors that regulate diverse biological processes in plants and apicomplexans. However, how CDPKs discriminate specific substrates in vivo is still largely unknown. Previously, we found that a potato StCDPK5 is dominantly localized to the plasma membrane and activates the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase (RBOH; for respiratory burst oxidase homolog) StRBOHB by direct phosphorylation of the N-terminal region. Here, we report the contribution of the StCDPK5 N-terminal variable (V) domain to activation of StRBOHB in vivo using heterologous expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana. Mutations of N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation sites in the V domain eliminated the predominantly plasma membrane localization and the capacity of StCDPK5 to activate StRBOHB in vivo. A tomato SlCDPK2, which also contains myristoylation and palmitoylation sites in its N terminus, phosphorylated StRBOHB in vitro but not in vivo. Functional domains responsible for activation and phosphorylation of StRBOHB were identified by swapping regions for each domain between StCDPK5 and SlCDPK2. The substitution of the V domain of StCDPK5 with that of SlCDPK2 abolished the activation and phosphorylation abilities of StRBOHB in vivo and relocalized the chimeric CDPK to the trans-Golgi network, as observed for SlCDPK2. Conversely, SlCDPK2 substituted with the V domain of StCDPK5 localized to the plasma membrane and activated StRBOHB. These results suggest that the V domains confer substrate specificity in vivo by dictating proper subcellular localization of CDPKs.

These results suggest that the V domains confer substrate specificity in vivo by dictating proper subcellular localization of CDPKs. Protein kinases regulate almost all aspects of cell life through phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, and Tyr. Protein phosphorylation is known to affect protein functions such as enzymatic activity, stabilization, subcellular localization, and interactions with other biomolecules (1Seet B.T. Dikic I. Zhou M.M. Pawson T. Reading protein modifications with interaction domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The spatiotemporal control of phosphorylation is crucial to cellular processes and relies on the proper regulation of protein kinases. Misregulation of protein phosphorylation often results in negative consequences such as cancer and complex regulatory diseases. Indeed, the first oncogene to be discovered, v-src, encodes an aberrantly regulated Tyr kinase (2Eckhart W. Hutchinson M.A. Hunter T. An activity phosphorylating tyrosine in polyoma T antigen immunoprecipitates.Cell. 1979; 18: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity is believed to depend on the interaction between the active site of kinase and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites of substrate (e.g. by way of conserved docking motifs on substrate) (3Sharrocks A.D.

In addition to kinase-substrate interaction, subcellular localization, differential timing, and tissue expression, and/or functional adaptors such as scaffold proteins could be determinant for the substrate in vivo. Although identification of in vivo substrates is important to understand aspects of cell life, how protein kinases discriminate specific substrates in vivo is still largely unknown.

CDPKs are composed of an N-terminal variable (V) domain, a protein kinase (K) domain, an autoinhibitory junction (J) domain, and a calmodulin-like (C) domain including four EF-hand motifs and are activated via conformational changes triggered by the binding of Ca2+ to the C domain (9Harper J.F.

The Arabidopsis genome encodes 34 CDPKs (also designated as CPKs) that are clustered into four subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity (8Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Calcium signaling through protein kinases.Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Although none of the CDPKs has transmembrane domains, the majority of CDPKs have potential myristoylation and palmitoylation motifs at the beginning of their N-terminal V domain that may be responsible for membrane association (8Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Calcium signaling through protein kinases.Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar).

Potato (Solanum tuberosum) StCDPK4 and StCDPK5 phosphorylate and activate the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase (RBOH; for respiratory burst oxidase homolog) StRBOHB, resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (19Kobayashi M.

Here, we investigated in vivo substrate specificity between StCDPK5 and StRBOHB. Mutations of N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation sites in StCDPK5, which are responsible for localization at the membrane, eliminated the StCDPK5-StRBOHB interaction and StCDPK5-mediated StRBOHB phosphorylation in vivo. The N-terminal V domain of StCDPK5 conferred proper localization and the ability to activate StRBOHB in vivo to a distinct CDPK that phosphorylates StRBOHB in vitro but not in vivo. These results indicate the N-terminal V domain of StCDPK5 for proper subcellular localization and consequent discrimination of specific substrates in vivo.

HA-tagged and FLAG-tagged proteins were detected by monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone HA-7; Sigma-Aldrich) and monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (F3165; Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. For immunoblotting, equal amounts of proteins were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). After blocking in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, the membranes were incubated with anti-StRBOHB, anti-pSer-82, anti-HA, or anti-FLAG antibodies diluted with TBS-T at room temperature for 1 h or at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig or anti-mouse Ig antibody (GE Healthcare) diluted with TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The antibody-antigen complex was detected using the ECL protein gel blot detection kit (GE Healthcare) and Light-Capture equipped with a CCD camera (ATTO), and immunostained bands were analyzed by the CS Analyzer 2.1 (ATTO). For recombinant proteins, cDNA fragments of CDPK were cloned into pET44a(+) (Novagen) and were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIPL (Stratagene). The bacteria were cultured overnight at 37 °C, transferred to 100-fold LB medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin, and then incubated to A600 of 0.6 at 37 °C. Protein synthesis was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Cells were collected and resuspended in the buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl). NusA-fused CDPKs were extracted via sonication and purified using nickel-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare).

CDPKs consist of a V domain comprising highly variable amino acid sequences, a K domain that phosphorylates a substrate, a J domain that acts as an autoinhibitor in a pseudo-substrate fashion, and a C domain, including Ca2+-sensing EF-hand motifs (Fig. 1A). Upon elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, binding of Ca2+ to the C domain triggers a conformational change to release autoinhibition and allows enzyme activation (9Harper J.F. Breton G.

https://openalex.org/W2061740577,"Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an expanded polyglutamine (poly(Q)) repeat near the N terminus of the huntingtin (htt) protein. Expanded poly(Q) facilitates formation of htt aggregates, eventually leading to deposition of cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies containing htt. Flanking sequences directly adjacent to the poly(Q) domain, such as the first 17 amino acids on the N terminus (Nt17) and the polyproline (poly(P)) domain on the C-terminal side of the poly(Q) domain, heavily influence aggregation. Additionally, htt interacts with a variety of membraneous structures within the cell, and Nt17 is implicated in lipid binding. To investigate the interaction between htt exon1 and lipid membranes, a combination of in situ atomic force microscopy, Langmuir trough techniques, and vesicle permeability assays were used to directly monitor the interaction of a variety of synthetic poly(Q) peptides with different combinations of flanking sequences (KK-Q35-KK, KK-Q35-P10-KK, Nt17-Q35-KK, and Nt17-Q35-P10-KK) on model membranes and surfaces. Each peptide aggregated on mica, predominately forming extended, fibrillar aggregates. In contrast, poly(Q) peptides that lacked the Nt17 domain did not appreciably aggregate on or insert into lipid membranes. Nt17 facilitated the interaction of peptides with lipid surfaces, whereas the poly(P) region enhanced this interaction. The aggregation of Nt17-Q35-P10-KK on the lipid bilayer closely resembled that of a htt exon1 construct containing 35 repeat glutamines. Collectively, this data suggests that the Nt17 domain plays a critical role in htt binding and aggregation on lipid membranes, and this lipid/htt interaction can be further modulated by the presence of the poly(P) domain."
https://openalex.org/W2003593645,"Vitamin D (VitD) is now recognized for its pleiotrophic roles in regulating immune function. VitD interaction with other steroid receptor superfamily receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is poorly understood. In the current study, we demonstrate that VitD enhanced glucocorticoid (GC) responses in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells because it stimulated GC induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and enhanced GC inhibition of LPS-induced IL-6. These VitD effects were abolished in purified CD14(+) and CD14(-) cells but were recovered in CD14(+) cells co-cultured with CD14(-) cells separated by tissue culture inserts. GM-CSF, found in culture supernatants from CD14(-) cells, was shown to mediate VitD enhancement of GC-induced MKP-1 production in monocytes via increased production of mediator complex subunit 14 (MED14). Recruitment of VitD receptor and MED14, 4.7 kbp upstream of the human MKP-1 gene transcription start site, enhanced binding of glucocorticoid receptor and histone H4 acetylation at the 4.6-kbp glucocorticoid response element of the MKP-1 promoter in the presence of GM-CSF in U937 cells. Knockdown of MED14 abolished VitD-mediated enhancement of GC-induced MKP-1 production. These data demonstrate VitD-mediated stimulation of GC anti-inflammatory effects in human monocytes and identify a role for GM-CSF and MED14 as mediators of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2013866078,"Toothed whales (Cetacea, odontoceti) use biosonar to navigate their environment and to find and catch prey. All studied toothed whale species have evolved highly directional, high-amplitude ultrasonic clicks suited for long-range echolocation of prey in open water. Little is known about the biosonar signals of toothed whale species inhabiting freshwater habitats such as endangered river dolphins. To address the evolutionary pressures shaping the echolocation signal parameters of non-marine toothed whales, we investigated the biosonar source parameters of Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) and Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) within the river systems of the Sundarban mangrove forest. Both Ganges and Irrawaddy dolphins produced echolocation clicks with a high repetition rate and low source level compared to marine species. Irrawaddy dolphins, inhabiting coastal and riverine habitats, produced a mean source level of 195 dB (max 203 dB) re 1 µPapp whereas Ganges river dolphins, living exclusively upriver, produced a mean source level of 184 dB (max 191) re 1 µPapp. These source levels are 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than those of similar sized marine delphinids and may reflect an adaptation to a shallow, acoustically complex freshwater habitat with high reverberation and acoustic clutter. The centroid frequency of Ganges river dolphin clicks are an octave lower than predicted from scaling, but with an estimated beamwidth comparable to that of porpoises. The unique bony maxillary crests found in the Platanista forehead may help achieve a higher directionality than expected using clicks nearly an octave lower than similar sized odontocetes."
https://openalex.org/W2122536112,"Rifampin has been used for the treatment of bacterial infections for many years. Clinically, rifampin has been found to possess immunomodulatory effects. However, the molecular target responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of rifampin is not known. Herein, we show that rifampin binds to myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2), the key coreceptor for innate immune TLR4. Rifampin blocked TLR4 signaling induced by LPS, including NF-kB activation and the overproduction of proinflammatory mediators nitric oxide, interleukin 1 β, and tumor necrosis factor α in mouse microglia BV-2 cells and macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Rifampin's inhibition of TLR4 signaling was also observed in immunocompetent rat primary macrophage, microglia, and astrocytes. Further, we show that rifampin (75 or 100 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 d, intraperitoneal) suppressed allodynia induced by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve and suppressed nerve injury-induced activation of microglia. Our findings indicate that MD-2 is a important target of rifampin in its inhibition of innate immune function and contributes to its clinically observed immune-suppressive effect. The results also suggest that rifampin may be repositioned as an agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain.—Wang, X., Grace, P. M., Pham, M. N., Cheng, K., Strand, K.

https://openalex.org/W2144966500,"Peripheral nerve injury is a major neurological disorder that can cause severe motor and sensory dysfunction. Neurogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been found in the central nervous system, and we examined whether VEGF could promote anatomical and functional recovery of peripheral nerves after injury using an avascular corneal nerve injury model. We found that VEGF enhanced neurite elongation in isolated trigeminal ganglion neurons in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was suppressed by neutralizing antibodies for VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 and 2 or neuropilin receptor 1 or by VEGFR2 inhibitors (SU 1498 and Ki 8751). In vivo, mice receiving sustained VEGF via implanted pellets showed increased corneal nerve regeneration after superficial injury compared with those receiving vehicle. VEGF injected subconjunctivally at the time of injury accelerated reinnervation, the recovery of mechanosensation, and epithelial wound healing. Endogenous VEGF expression was up-regulated in the corneal epithelium and stroma after wounding. Thus, VEGF can mediate peripheral neuron growth but requires the activation of multiple VEGF receptor types. In addition, VEGF can accelerate the return of sensory and trophic functions of damaged peripheral nerves. Wounding induces the expression of VEFG, which may modulate physiological nerve repair."
https://openalex.org/W2154025134,"The DRM method has proved to be a popular and powerful, if controversial, way to study ‘false memories’. One reason for the controversy is that the extent to which the DRM effect generalises to other kinds of memory error has been neither satisfactorily established nor subject to much empirical attention. In the present paper we contribute data to this ongoing debate. One hundred and twenty participants took part in a standard misinformation effect experiment, in which they watched some CCTV footage, were exposed to misleading post-event information about events depicted in the footage, and then completed free recall and recognition tests. Participants also completed a DRM test as an ostensibly unrelated filler task. Despite obtaining robust misinformation and DRM effects, there were no correlations between a broad range of misinformation and DRM effect measures (mean r = −.01). This was not due to reliability issues with our measures or a lack of power. Thus DRM ‘false memories’ and misinformation effect ‘false memories’ do not appear to be equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W2036149102,"Maturation of the single-chain caspase-9 zymogen through autoproteolytic processing is mediated by the Apaf-1 apoptosome at the onset of apoptosis. Processed caspase-9 and the apoptosome form a holoenzyme with robust proteolytic activity that is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of free processed caspase-9. An unresolved important question is the role of caspase-9 processing, with some experimental data suggesting its dispensability. In this study, we demonstrate that, in contrast to wild-type caspase-9, the unprocessed single-chain caspase-9 triple mutant E306A/D315A/D330A (Casp9-TM) could no longer be adequately activated by the apoptosome. Compared with the protease activity of wild-type caspase-9, that of Casp9-TM in the presence of the apoptosome was drastically reduced. The crippled protease activity of Casp9-TM in the presence of the apoptosome is likely attributable to a markedly reduced ability of Casp9-TM to form homodimers. These data identify an essential role for the autoproteolytic processing of caspase-9 in its activation."
https://openalex.org/W2131920157,"Histamine is an important mediator in the development of allergic reactions. Only a small subset of human cell types is able to produce histamine. No previous studies have shown that human neutrophils are among them. The present work was undertaken to analyze whether human neutrophils produce histamine, and to determine what agonists are involved in histamine production by human neutrophils. The expression of histidine decarboxylase in human neutrophils was established by quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry analysis. The activity of the enzyme was determined by ELISA, which measured histamine in the culture supernatant of neutrophils stimulated with a set of classical agonists. Human neutrophils are bona fide histamine-producing cells. Neutrophils store ~0.29 pg/cell and release ~50% of the histamine content in an antigen-dependent manner and on stimulation with other neutrophil agonists. Basal expression of histidine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in histamine production, is higher in neutrophils from patients with allergies than from healthy donors. Our results cannot be ascribed to cell contamination for several reasons. LPS failed to induce histamine release by basophils, whereas it induced histamine release by neutrophils; and we did not detect basophils, monocytes, or lymphocytes in our neutrophil preparations. Eosinophils, albeit detected, were only 0.001-0.004% of the final cell population, and they did not store or release histamine on antigen or LPS stimulation. Antigens to which patients with allergies were sensitized stimulated release of histamine from neutrophils. These observations represent a novel view of neutrophils as possible source of histamine in the allergic diseases.—Alcañiz, L., Vega, A., Chacón, P., El Bekay, R., Ventura, I., Aroca, R., Blanca, M., Bergstralh, D.

https://openalex.org/W2151135563,"Testes contain two distinct Leydig cell populations during development: fetal and adult Leydig cells (FLCs and ALCs, respectively). ALCs are not derived from FLCs, and it is unknown whether these two populations share common progenitors. We discovered that hedgehog (Hh) signaling is responsible for transforming steroidogenic factor 1-positive (SF1+) progenitors into FLCs. However, not all SF1+ progenitors become FLCs, and some remain undifferentiated through fetal development. We therefore hypothesized that if FLCs and ALCs share SF1+ progenitors, increased Hh pathway activation in SF1+ progenitor cells could change the dynamics and distribution of SF1+ progenitors, FLCs, and ALCs. Using a genetic model involving constitutive activation of Hh pathway in SF1+ cells, we observed reduced numbers of SF1+ progenitor cells and increased FLCs. Conversely, increased Hh activation led to decreased ALC populations prepubertally, while adult ALC numbers were comparable to control testes. Hence, reduction in SF1+ progenitors temporarily affects ALC numbers, suggesting that SF1+ progenitors in fetal testes are a potential source of both FLCs and ALCs. Besides transient ALC defects, adult animals with Hh activation in SF1+ progenitors had reduced testicular weight, oligospermia, and decreased sperm mobility. These defects highlight the importance of properly regulated Hh signaling in Leydig cell development and testicular functions.— Barsoum, I. B., Kaur, J. Ge, R. S., Cooke, P. S., Yao, H. H.-C.

The functional significance of chorein in other cell types remained ill-defined. The present study revealed chorein expression in blood platelets. As compared to platelets from healthy volunteers, platelets from patients with ChAc displayed a 47% increased globular/filamentous actin ratio, indicating actin depolymerization. Moreover, phosphoinositide-3-kinase subunit p85 phosphorylation, p21 protein-activated kinase (PAK1) phosphorylation, as well as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8) expression were significantly reduced in platelets from patients with ChAc (by 17, 22, and 39%, respectively) and in megakaryocytic (MEG-01) cells following chorein silencing (by 16, 54, and 11%, respectively). Activation-induced platelet secretion from dense granules (ATP release) and α granules (P-selectin exposure) were significantly less (by 55% after stimulation with 1 μg/ml CRP and by 33% after stimulation with 5 μM TRAP, respectively) in ChAc platelets than in control platelets. Furthermore, platelet aggregation following stimulation with different platelet agonists was significantly impaired.

In the experiment, the gaze cue either belonged to a (dominant looking) male face or a (non-dominant looking) female face. Critically, prior to the task, individuals were primed with pictures of threat or no threat to induce either a dangerous or safe environment. Findings revealed that the primed emotional context critically influenced the gaze cuing effect. While a gaze cue of the dominant male face influenced performance in both the threat and no-threat conditions, the gaze cue of the non-dominant female face only influenced performance in the no-threat condition. This research suggests an implicit, context-dependent follower bias, which carries implications for research on visual attention, social cognition, and leadership."

Cot/tpl2 KO mice exhibited reduced hepatic injury after acetaminophen challenge, as evidenced by decreased serum levels of both alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, decreased hepatic necrosis, and increased survival relative to Wt mice. Serum levels of both alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were also lower after intraperitoneal injection of acetaminophen in mice expressing an inactive form of Cot/tpl2 compared with Wt mice, suggesting that Cot/tpl2 activity contributes to acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Furthermore, Cot/tpl2 deficiency reduced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the liver of mice treated with acetaminophen, as well as their hepatic and systemic levels of IL-1α. Intraperitoneal injection of damage-associated molecular patterns from necrotic hepatocytes also impaired the recruitment of leukocytes and decreased the levels of several cytokines in the peritoneal cavity in Cot/tpl2 KO mice compared with Wt counterparts. Moreover, similar activation profiles of intracellular pathways were observed in Wt macrophages stimulated with Wt or Cot/tpl2 KO damage-associated molecular patterns. However, upon stimulation with damage-associated molecular patterns, the activation of Erk1/2 and JNK was deficient in Cot/tpl2 KO macrophages compared with their Wt counterparts; an effect accompanied by weaker release of several cytokines, including IL-1α, an important component in the development of sterile inflammation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Cot/tpl2 contributes to acetaminophen-induced liver injury, providing some insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms."

The XTH gene products compose a subfamily of glycoside hydrolase family 16 (GH16), which also comprises a broad range of microbial endoglucanases and endogalactanases, as well as yeast cell wall chitin/β-glucan transglycosylases. Previous whole-family phylogenetic analyses have suggested that the closest relatives to the XTH gene products are the bacterial licheninases (EC 3.2.1.73), which specifically hydrolyze linear mixed linkage β(1→3)/β(1→4)-glucans. In addition to their specificity for the highly branched xyloglucan polysaccharide, XTH gene products are distinguished from the licheninases and other GH16 enzyme subfamilies by significant active site loop alterations and a large C-terminal extension. Given these differences, the molecular evolution of the XTH gene products in GH16 has remained enigmatic. Here, we present the biochemical and structural analysis of a unique, mixed function endoglucanase from black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), which reveals a small, newly recognized subfamily of GH16 members intermediate between the bacterial licheninases and plant XTH gene products. We postulate that this clade comprises an important link in the evolution of the large plant XTH gene families from a putative microbial ancestor. As such, this analysis provides new insights into the diversification of GH16 and further unites the apparently disparate members of this important family of proteins."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ecologically versatile, Gram-negative bacterium, and some of this versatility is undoubtedly due to its ability to use a wide range of different compounds as energy sources for growth. It does not normally cause disease in healthy human adults, but can infect cuts and burns. It also frequently forms chronic infections in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) 3The abbreviations used are: CF, cystic fibrosis; SCFM, synthetic cystic fibrosis medium; GDH, glucose dehydrogenase; 6PGDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. patients. CF is a genetic disease caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, a chloride ion transporter, that leads to an ionic imbalance across the apical surface of epithelial cells and a dehydrated airway surface that impairs mucociliatory clearance. This offers an opportunity for bacterial colonization, and CF patients typically have a wide range of different colonizing bacteria (1Davies J.C. Alton E.W. Bush A. Cystic fibrosis.BMJ. 2007; 335: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, the majority of CF patients eventually become infected with P. aeruginosa, which is very difficult to eradicate from the CF lung once established and typically forms life-long chronic infections. The majority of CF patients ultimately die from respiratory failure caused by the cycle of infection, inflammation, and tissue damage brought on by this (2Williams H.D. Davies J.C. Basic science for the chest physician. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the cystic fibrosis airway.Thorax. 2012; 67: 465-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Understanding how P. aeruginosa adapts to the changing nutritional and physical environment of the CF lung as well as the presence of competing microbes is important to understand the ecology of this infection. Some genetic adaptations of P. aeruginosa have been identified during its chronic infection of the CF lung, but further knowledge of these and other aspects of the biology of this versatile bacterium will improve understanding of its infection biology as well as basic aspects of its gene function and physiology. The compendium approach has been influential in the post-genomic era. The basic concept is that compendia of phenotypic profiles, such as those generated by transcriptional microarrays, can be used to classify single-gene knockout strains on the basis that functionally related genes would cluster together (3Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett H.A. Coffey E. Dai H. He Y.D. Kidd M.J. King A.M. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Lum P.Y. Stepaniants S.B. Shoemaker D.D. Gachotte D.

Functional discovery via a compendium of expression profiles.Cell. 2000; 102: 109-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2095) Google Scholar). This approach is not restricted to transcriptomic data. The same approach can be applied to metabolomic profiles. Indeed, it has been argued that there are advantages to using metabolome rather than transcriptome data, as metabolic control analysis predicts that single-gene knockouts are likely to have larger changes in metabolite than transcript levels (4Raamsdonk L.M. Teusink B. Broadhurst D. Zhang N. Hayes A. Walsh M.C. Berden J.A. Brindle K.M. Kell D.B. Rowland J.J. Westerhoff H.V. van Dam K. Oliver S.G. A functional genomics strategy that uses metabolome data to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The experimental evidence to date is compatible with this, and the metabolic effects of gene deletion are clearly greater than the effects of altering growth rate (5Ishii N. Nakahigashi K. Baba T. Robert M. Soga T. Kanai A. Hirasawa T. Naba M. Hirai K. Hoque A. Ho P.Y. Kakazu Y. Sugawara K. Igarashi S. Harada S. Masuda T. Sugiyama N. Togashi T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Yugi K. Arakawa K. Iwata N.

Multiple high-throughput analyses monitor the response of E. coli to perturbations.Science. 2007; 316: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). There are also advantages to analyzing the exometabolome of cells, or metabolic footprinting (6Allen J. Davey H.M. Broadhurst D. Heald J.K. Rowland J.J. Oliver S.G. Kell D.B. High-throughput classification of yeast mutants for functional genomics using metabolic footprinting.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These are both procedural (the separation of medium from the cells is straightforward, and the accumulated metabolic changes are effectively integrated over time) and biological (as the extracellular medium is not under cellular homeostatic control, metabolites can accumulate to high levels). P. aeruginosa has a whole-genome knockout library available (PA14NR) (7Liberati N.T. Urbach J.M. Miyata S. Lee D.G. Drenkard E. Wu G. Villanueva J. Wei T. Ausubel F.M. An ordered, nonredundant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 transposon insertion mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2833-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Previous functional genomic studies with this library have focused on simple phenotypic endpoints (such as growth) under multiple conditions (8Dötsch A. Becker T. Pommerenke C. Magnowska Z. Jänsch L. Häussler S. Genomewide identification of genetic determinants of antimicrobial drug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 2522-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Pommerenke C. Müsken M. Becker T. Dötsch A. Klawonn F. Häussler S.

These approaches to characterizing “phenotypic landscapes” can be very powerful (11Hillenmeyer M.E. Fung E. Wildenhain J. Pierce S.E. Hoon S. Lee W. Proctor M. St Onge R.P. Tyers M. Koller D. Altman R.B. Davis R.W. Nislow C. Giaever G. The chemical genomic portrait of yeast.

Phenotypic landscape of a bacterial cell.Cell. 2011; 144: 143-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), but it would also be valuable to compare the compendium approach on the basis of information-rich complex phenotypes. Here we investigated the feasibility of using a metabolic footprinting approach to characterize large sample sets like whole-genome knockout libraries. As a proof-of-principle study, we carried out metabolic footprinting by NMR spectroscopy on a subset of 86 mutant strains of P. aeruginosa, chosen to represent a range of targets, including metabolic enzymes, transcriptional regulators, two-component systems, and quorum sensing pathways. We then analyzed the exometabolome of cells grown on synthetic cystic fibrosis medium (SCFM), a defined medium that is designed to mimic the metabolic composition of CF sputum (13Palmer K.L. Aye L.M. Whiteley M. Nutritional cues control Pseudomonas aeruginosa multicellular behavior in cystic fibrosis sputum.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Finally, we tested a novel phenotype (gluconate excretion) in a number of CF clinical isolates and its relation to antibiotic susceptibility. The deletion library strains were taken from PA14NR, created by Liberati et al. (7Liberati N.T. Urbach J.M. Miyata S. Lee D.G. Drenkard E. Wu G. Villanueva J. Wei T. Ausubel F.M. An ordered, nonredundant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 transposon insertion mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2833-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), in a PA14 background. We chose 86 of these strains. The full list is given in supplemental Table S1. For the characterization of the rpoN mutation and the crc and crcZ genes, we received an in-frame deletion mutant and complemented mutant strain in the PAO1 background from D. Haas (University of Lausanne, Switzerland). To account for the functional glutamine auxotrophy (14Totten P.A. Lara J.C. Lory S. The rpoN gene product of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is required for expression of diverse genes, including the flagellin gene.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 389-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we supplemented the growth media for all experiments containing the rpoN mutant with 2 mm glutamine. All strains were grown in 1 ml of SCFM (13Palmer K.L. Aye L.M. Whiteley M. Nutritional cues control Pseudomonas aeruginosa multicellular behavior in cystic fibrosis sputum.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 8079-8087Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) in 96-well deep-well plates sealed with oxygen-permeable membranes to allow gas transfer. Samples were taken after 24 h by centrifuging the plates and transferring the supernatants to a new deep-well plate. Experiments were carried out with five biological replicates. We prepared samples for NMR by mixing 0.8 ml of cell supernatant with 0.2 ml of NMR buffer. The NMR buffer contained 3.3 mm sodium trimethylsilyl-2H6-propanesulfonic acid and 24 mm NaN3 in 2H2O, resulting in a final concentration in each sample of 0.66 and 4.8 mm, respectively. We acquired the spectra on a Bruker DRX600 Avance spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) with a magnetic field strength of 14.1 tesla and 600 MHz proton resonance frequency, equipped with a 4-mm flow probe. The samples were held at 300 K during acquisition and were introduced using a Gilson robot flow-injection autosampler. A sample volume of 0.7 ml was injected onto the flow probe, with three probe wash steps between every sample. The samples were injected in the order that they were cultured in 96-well plates, and five replicate plates were injected in turn. Spectra were acquired using a one-dimensional solvent-suppressed sequence essentially as described by Beckonert et al. (15Beckonert O. Keun H.C. Ebbels T.M. Bundy J. Holmes E. Lindon J.C. Nicholson J.K. Metabolic profiling, metabolomic and metabonomic procedures for NMR spectroscopy of urine, plasma, serum and tissue extracts.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2692-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Metabolite assignments were on the basis of matching chemical shifts and multiplicities to online databases such as the Human Metabolome Database (16Wishart D.S. Knox C. Guo A.C. Eisner R. Young N. Gautam B. Hau D.D. Psychogios N. Dong E. Bouatra S. Mandal R. Sinelnikov I. Xia J. Jia L. Cruz J.A. Lim E. Sobsey C.A. Shrivastava S. Huang P. Liu P. Fang L. Peng J. Fradette R. Cheng D. Tzur D.

A knowledgebase for the human metabolome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D603-D610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) and the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (17Ulrich E.L. Akutsu H. Doreleijers J.F. Harano Y. Ioannidis Y.E. Lin J. Livny M. Mading S. Maziuk D. Miller Z. Nakatani E. Schulte C.F. Tolmie D.E. Kent Wenger R. Yao H. Markley J.L. BioMagResBank.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D402-D408Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar) and by using the proprietary NMR Suite database (Chenomx, Alberta, Canada). Assignment of pyruvate, 2,2′-dihydropropanoate and gluconate was confirmed by acquiring two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra. The data were initially processed in iNMR 3 (Nucleomatica, Molfetta, Italy). The free induction decays were zero-filled by a factor of 1.5 and multiplied by an exponential apodization factor equivalent to 1 Hz line broadening, followed by Fourier transform. Phase correction, baseline correction, and referencing chemical shifts to sodium trimethylsilyl-2H6-propanesulfonic acid (δ = 0) were carried out using the proprietary algorithms of the software, and the spectra were exported as ASCII files and imported into Matlab. For first-pass data analysis, the spectra were then aligned following the method of Veselkov et al. (18Veselkov K.A. Lindon J.C. Ebbels T.M. Crockford D. Volynkin V.V. Holmes E. Davies D.B. Nicholson J.K. Recursive segment-wise peak alignment of biological 1H NMR spectra for improved metabolic biomarker recovery.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and integral boundaries were chosen manually so that, as far as possible, each resonance was represented by a single integral, and all resonances across the set of spectra were included. In many cases, integrals included contributions from more than one metabolite because of overlapping resonances. The spectra were then reprocessed for a more in-depth analysis by fitting individual metabolites to the spectra using the R package BATMAN, which uses a Bayesian approach to deconvolve one-dimensional spectra into a mixture of Lorentzian functions with wavelet functions used to fit residual intensity (19Astle W. De Iorio M. Richardson S. Stephens D. Ebbels T. A Bayesian model of NMR spectra for the deconvolution and quantification of metabolites in complex biological mixtures.J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 2012; 107: 1259-1271Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Hao J. Astle W. De Iorio M. Ebbels T.M. BATMAN. An R package for the automated quantification of metabolites from nuclear magnetic resonance spectra using a Bayesian model.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 2088-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The spectra were ordered with respect to pH to improve peak identification (21Liebeke M. Hao J. Ebbels T.M.D. Bundy J.G. Combining spectral ordering with peak fitting for 1D NMR quantitative metabolomics.Anal. Chem. 2013; 85 (10.1021/ac400237w)Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We used a commercial enzymatic gluconate assay (Megazyme Ltd., Ireland). The assay was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer, except that we converted it to a 96-well-plate format by reducing the reaction mixture volume to 20 μl of reaction buffer, 20 μl of NADP+/ATP solution, 2 μl of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase suspension, 2 μl of gluconate kinase suspension, and 100 μl of bacterial supernatant. The assay was linear between 5 and 1250 μm gluconate. We grew 50-ml cultures of the PA14 wild-type strain and the rpoN mutant and harvested them by centrifugation (3000 × g, 30 min) when they reached an A600 of between 0.3 and 0.8. The pelleted cells were washed in 20 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7), resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate buffer, and kept on ice. An oxygen electrode was equilibrated with 3 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7) and maintained at 30 °C. Briefly, 100 μl of cells was added to 3 ml of phosphate buffer on the electrode, and the signal response was recorded on a chart recorder for 3 min to establish a base-line oxygen concentration. For each sample, 30 μl of either 1 m glucose or 1 m gluconate was then added, and the signal response was recorded for 3 min to establish the rate of oxygen consumption associated with glucose or gluconate dehydrogenase, respectively. The base-line rate of oxygen consumption was subtracted from the rate following addition of either glucose or gluconate. Oxygen consumption rates were then normalized to protein concentration for each sample, which was determined using a modified Lowry procedure (22Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. A modification of the Lowry procedure to simplify protein determination in membrane and lipoprotein samples.Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar). We used the commercial Biolog “phenotype microarray” system (23Zhou L. Lei X.H. Bochner B.R. Wanner B.L. Phenotype microarray analysis of Escherichia coli K-12 mutants with deletions of all two-component systems.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4956-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) to profile the wild-type and rpoN mutant strains (on a PA14 background) with the plates PM1, PM2A, and PM3B containing 190 separate sole carbon source and 95 separate sole nitrogen source substrates (Technopath, Ballina, Ireland). Briefly, cells were grown as preculture in M9 + glucose + glutamine to optical densities of 0.6–0.8. At this optical density, 2 ml of cells were harvested, washed with quarter-strength microbiological Ringer's solution, and resuspended in 10 ml of inoculation medium (M9 salts). For carbon plates, the inoculation medium contained NH4Cl and glutamine, and for PM3B, it contained glucose and glutamine. Cells were grown for 24 h, after which the optical density at 595 and 750 nm was recorded. The 750-nm reading is a measurement of general turbidity, whereas 595 nm is the absorption maximum of the reduced dye. We analyzed the endometabolome of the wild-type, rpoN, and complemented mutant on the PAO1 background. The cells were sampled (n = 6) by rapid filtration using a method adapted from Bolten et al. (24Bolten C.J. Kiefer P. Letisse F. Portais J.C. Wittmann C. Sampling for metabolome analysis of microorganisms.Anal. Chem. 2007; 79: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 ml of culture was harvested by vacuum filtration (filter: polytetrafluoroethylene, 0.45-μm pore size, 47 mm; stand: magnetic filter funnel, Pall, Ann Arbor, MI) and washed with 5 ml of 0.9% saline solution. The filter was transferred to a 50-ml reaction tube containing 10 ml of cold (−40 °C) methanol:acetonitrile:H2O (2:2:1, v/v/v) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Afterward, all extracts were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles and sonication. After the removal of the filter, the extracts were centrifuged to pellet the cellular debris and dried in a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, 45 °C). We derivatized the samples by methoximation followed by trimethylsilylation, following the method of Kind et al. (25Kind T. Wohlgemuth G. Lee do Y. Lu Y. Palazoglu M. Shahbaz S. Fiehn O. FiehnLib. Mass spectral and retention index libraries for metabolomics based on quadrupole and time-of-flight gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 10038-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar), and analyzed them on a 7890 GC coupled to a 5975c mass spectrometer (Agilent, UK). We analyzed the data by first processing all files with AMDIS using the FiehnLib retention time-locked library (25Kind T. Wohlgemuth G. Lee do Y. Lu Y. Palazoglu M. Shahbaz S. Fiehn O. FiehnLib. Mass spectral and retention index libraries for metabolomics based on quadrupole and time-of-flight gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 10038-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). We then carried out an additional step for manual inspection of all peaks across all samples, with manual adjustment of retention time windows where appropriate, and “back-filled” the sample matrix by reintegrating the raw data so that every sample/peak combination had a numerical value (26Behrends V. Tredwell G.D. Bundy J.G. A software complement to AMDIS for processing GC-MS metabolomic data.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 415: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We measured gluconate production in 156 longitudinal isolates taken from 16 patients, in which each set of strains from a single patient represented a clonal lineage (27Behrends V. Ryall B. Zlosnik J.E. Speert D.P. Bundy J.G. Williams H.D. Metabolic adaptations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis chronic lung infections.Environ. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 398-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We then chose a subset of 96 of these isolates and measured minimal inhibitory concentrations of five different antibiotics (tobramycin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, colistin, and aztreonam) using Etest strips impregnated with an antibiotic gradient (bioMérieux, Basingstoke, UK). Genotypes as assessed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) typing (28Mahenthiralingam E. Campbell M.E. Foster J. Lam J.S. Speert D.P. Random amplified polymorphic DNA typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates recovered from patients with cystic fibrosis.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 1129-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of these isolates were available from a previous study (29Speert D.P. Campbell M.E. Henry D.A. Milner R. Taha F. Gravelle A. Davidson A.G. Wong L.T. Mahenthiralingam E. Epidemiology of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis in British Columbia, Canada.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 166: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We selected a total of 86 mutants, corresponding to 72 genes in total, as some genes were represented by more than one insertion (supplemental Table S1). We grew the bacterial strains in 1 ml of SCFM and sampled the medium after 24 h of growth for exometabolome profiling. Most of the strains alkalized the growth medium to some extent (data not shown), and so there were pH-related shifts in resonance frequencies between spectra. Because of this, using simple peak integrals gave poor-quality data, and so we used a peak-fitting deconvolution method to provide the best output. Manual peak-fitting (“targeted profiling”) by a skilled spectroscopist using computer-aided software such as Chenomx NMR Suite (30Weljie A.M. Newton J. Mercier P. Carlson E. Slupsky C.M. Targeted profiling. Quantitative analysis of 1H NMR metabolomics data.Anal. Chem. 2006; 78: 4430-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) is highly precise (31Tredwell G.D. Behrends V. Geier F.M. Liebeke M. Bundy J.G. Between-person comparison of metabolite fitting for NMR-based quantitative metabolomics.Anal. Chem. 2011; 83: 8683-8687Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but is time-consuming and therefore not feasible for projects with large numbers of spectra. We used the freely available R package BATMAN (19Astle W. De Iorio M. Richardson S. Stephens D. Ebbels T. A Bayesian model of NMR spectra for the deconvolution and quantification of metabolites in complex biological mixtures.J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 2012; 107: 1259-1271Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Hao J. Astle W. De Iorio M. Ebbels T.M. BATMAN. An R package for the automated quantification of metabolites from nuclear magnetic resonance spectra using a Bayesian model.Bioinformatics. 2012; 28: 2088-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to fit individual metabolites to the spectra, thus allowing for both peak overlap and peak shifting. We manually inspected all of the spectra to make sure there were no incorrectly fitted metabolites. The results were quantitatively comparable with the de facto gold standard Chenomx data when compared for a representative sample of spectra (data not shown). We quantified 25 metabolites from the spectra, eight of which were excreted by some or all of the strains and 17 of which were present in the original medium and consumed to varying degrees. All of the data are available for downloading (supplemental Table S2). Five of the eight excreted metabolites were assigned (ethanol, formate, acetate, pyruvate, and gluconate), and we also quantified three unassigned resonances (δ 1.06 ppm (doublet), δ 2.47 ppm (singlet), and δ 4.44 ppm (singlet)). We wanted to determine whether NMR exometabolome data would be useful for clustering knockout mutants of related function, and so carried out an initial analysis on whole profiles. Principal component analysis is a robust, unsupervised, multivariate technique that is often used for dimension reduction and data visualization. Principal component analysis alone was sufficient to show that strain replicates clustered tightly together, indicating good biological reproducibility (Fig. 1). The majority of the mutants grew to similar final A600 as the wild type (Fig. 2), but some strains had clear growth defects. The two tpiA mutants and putative acoA mutant did not grow, whereas the rpoN, aceE, and aceF mutants had moderate to severe growth defects. A number of strains grew to higher final densities than the wild type, with six mutants reaching A600 of greater than 120% of the wild type. PC1 could be interpreted as an overall growth axis. PC1 scores were highly correlated to A600 (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.0001). On PC2, the aceE, aceF, as well as rpoN clustered away from the majority of the strains (Fig. 1).FIGURE 2Metabolite changes in P. aeruginosa mutants.

We tested the expression of IL-17A, RORγ(t) and FOXP3 in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes from intermittent and mild-moderate asthma. The effect of Budesonide and Formoterol was tested “in vitro” on IL-17A, RORγ(t) and FOXP3 expression in cultured T-lymphocytes from mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis patients, and on nasal and bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with NW and Ss from mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis. Further, the effect of 12 weeks of treatment with Budesonide and Formoterol was tested “in vivo” in T-lymphocytes from mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis patients. IL-17A was increased in Ss, NW and P from children with mild-moderate asthma compared with intermittent and HC. In cultured T-lymphocytes IL-17A and RORγ(t) expression were higher in mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis than in mild-moderate asthma/intermittent rhinitis, while FOXP3 was reduced. Budesonide with Formoterol reduced IL-17A and RORγ(t), while increased FOXP3 in cultured T-lymphocytes from mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis, and reduced the IL-8 release mediated by IL-17A present in NW and Ss from mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis in nasal and bronchial epithelial cells. Finally, Budesonide with Formoterol reduced IL-17A levels in P and Ss, CD4+IL-17A+T-cells, in naïve children with mild-moderate asthma/persistent rhinitis after 12 weeks of treatment. Th17 mediated immunity may be involved in the airway disease of children with allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. Budesonide with Formoterol might be a useful tool for its therapeutic control."
https://openalex.org/W2088407586,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-I molecules can present long peptides, yet the mechanisms by which T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize featured pHLA-I landscapes are unclear. We compared the binding modes of three distinct human TCRs, CA5, SB27, and SB47, complexed with a ""super-bulged"" viral peptide (LPEPLPQGQLTAY) restricted by HLA-B*35:08. The CA5 and SB27 TCRs engaged HLA-B*35:08(LPEP) similarly, straddling the central region of the peptide but making limited contacts with HLA-B*35:08. Remarkably, the CA5 TCR did not contact the α1-helix of HLA-B*35:08. Differences in the CDR3β loop between the CA5 and SB27 TCRs caused altered fine specificities. Surprisingly, the SB47 TCR engaged HLA-B*35:08(LPEP) using a completely distinct binding mechanism, namely ""bypassing"" the bulged peptide and making extensive contacts with the extreme N-terminal end of HLA-B*35:08. This docking footprint included HLA-I residues not observed previously as TCR contact sites. The three TCRs exhibited differing patterns of alloreactivity toward closely related or distinct HLA-I allotypes. Thus, the human T-cell repertoire comprises a range of TCRs that can interact with ""bulged"" pHLA-I epitopes using unpredictable strategies, including the adoption of atypical footprints on the MHC-I."
https://openalex.org/W2090101716,"The N-end rule pathway contributes significantly to accelerated muscle proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in various catabolic conditions. UBR2 (aka E3α-II) is the only known E3 ubiquitin ligase of the N-end rule pathway that is up-regulated by cachectic stimuli including proinflammatory cytokines and tumors. However, the signaling mechanism through which UBR2 is up-regulated remains undetermined. Here we identify a signaling pathway that mediates tumor cell-induced up-regulation of UBR2. UBR2 expression in C2C12 myotubes was up-regulated by conditioned medium from Lewis lung carcinoma cells or C26 colon adenocarcinoma cells, which was blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of p38α/β mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), SB202190. Similarly, SB202190 administration (i.p.) abolished UBR2 up-regulation in the tibialis anterior of LLC tumor-bearing mice. Genetic gain and loss of function assays in C2C12 myotubes indicated that tumor-induced activation of the p38β isoform is sufficient and necessary for UBR2 up-regulation. In addition, UBR2 up-regulation required p38β-mediated phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-β Thr-188, which was critical to C/EBPβ binding to the UBR2 promoter. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay revealed that the C/EBPβ binding motif in the UBR2 promoter is a functional C/EBPβ-responsive cis-element that enhances the promoter activity on activation by p38β. Finally, genetic ablation of C/EBPβ blocked UBR2 up-regulation in LLC tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that UBR2 up-regulation in cachectic muscle is mediated by the p38β-C/EBPβ signaling pathway responsible for the bulk of tumor-induced muscle proteolysis.—Zhang, G., Lin, R.-K., Kwon, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2134734631,"Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a causative agent of viral myocarditis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and meningitis in humans. The adenosine-uridine (AU)-rich element RNA binding factor 1 (AUF1) is an integral component in the regulation of gene expression. AUF1 destabilizes mRNAs and targets them for degradation by binding to AU-rich elements in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. The 3′-UTR of the CVB3 genome contains canonical AU-rich sequences, raising the possibility that CVB3 RNA may also be subjected to AUF1-mediated degradation. Here, we reported that CVB3 infection led to cytoplasmic redistribution and cleavage of AUF1. These events are independent of CVB3-induced caspase activation but require viral protein production. Overexpression of viral protease 2A reproduced CVB3-induced cytoplasmic redistribution of AUF1, while in vitro cleavage assay revealed that viral protease 3C contributed to AUF1 cleavage. Furthermore, we showed that knockdown of AUF1 facilitated viral RNA, protein, and progeny production, suggesting an antiviral property for AUF1 against CVB3 infection. Finally, an immunoprecipitation study demonstrated the physical interaction between AUF1 and the 3′-UTR of CVB3, potentially targeting CVB3 genome toward degradation. Together, our results suggest that cleavage of AUF1 may be a strategy employed by CVB3 to enhance the stability of its viral genome.—Wong, J., Si, X., Angeles, A., Zhang, J., Shi, J., Fung, G., Jagdeo, J., Wang, T., Zhong, Z., Jan, E., Luo, H.

https://openalex.org/W2000531792,"Background Knowing the national disease burden of severe influenza in low-income countries can inform policy decisions around influenza treatment and prevention. We present a novel methodology using locally generated data for estimating this burden. Methods and Findings This method begins with calculating the hospitalized severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence for children <5 years old and persons ≥5 years old from population-based surveillance in one province. This base rate of SARI is then adjusted for each province based on the prevalence of risk factors and healthcare-seeking behavior. The percentage of SARI with influenza virus detected is determined from provincial-level sentinel surveillance and applied to the adjusted provincial rates of hospitalized SARI. Healthcare-seeking data from healthcare utilization surveys is used to estimate non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI. Rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI are applied to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The method was field-tested in Kenya, and validated in Guatemala, using data from August 2009–July 2011. In Kenya (2009 population 38.6 million persons), the annual number of hospitalized influenza-associated SARI cases ranged from 17,129–27,659 for children <5 years old (2.9–4.7 per 1,000 persons) and 6,882–7,836 for persons ≥5 years old (0.21–0.24 per 1,000 persons), depending on year and base rate used. In Guatemala (2011 population 14.7 million persons), the annual number of hospitalized cases of influenza-associated pneumonia ranged from 1,065–2,259 (0.5–1.0 per 1,000 persons) among children <5 years old and 779–2,252 cases (0.1–0.2 per 1,000 persons) for persons ≥5 years old, depending on year and base rate used. In both countries, the number of non-hospitalized influenza-associated cases was several-fold higher than the hospitalized cases. Conclusions Influenza virus was associated with a substantial amount of severe disease in Kenya and Guatemala. This method can be performed in most low and lower-middle income countries."
https://openalex.org/W2002864550,"Globally treatment outcomes for multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remain poor and this is compounded by high drug toxicity. Little is known about the influence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) on treatment outcomes in South Africa.We evaluated the impact of severe ADRs among a prospective cohort of MDR-TB patients in South Africa (2000-2004). The HIV-infected study participants were anti-retroviral naïve.Of 2,079 patients enrolled, 1,390 (66.8%) were included in this analysis based on known HIV test results (39.1% HIV-infected). At least one severe ADR was reported in 83 (6.9%) patients with ototoxicity being the most frequent ADR experienced (38.9%).We found that being HIV-infected but antiretroviral naïve did not increase occurrence of SADRs in patients on second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Early screening and proactive management of ADRs in this patient population is essential, especially given the rollout of decentralized care and the potential for overlapping toxicity of concomitant MDR-TB and HIV treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2038705345,"The ATPase-driven dimeric molecular Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) and its cofactor Cdc37 (cell division cycle 37 protein) are crucial to prevent the cellular depletion of many protein kinases. In complex with Hsp90, Cdc37 is thought to bind an important lid structure in the ATPase domain of Hsp90 and inhibit ATP turnover by Hsp90. As different interaction modes have been reported, we were interested in the interaction mechanism of Hsp90 and Cdc37. We find that Cdc37 can bind to one subunit of the Hsp90 dimer. The inhibition of the ATPase activity is caused by a reduction in the closing rate of Hsp90 without obviously bridging the two subunits or affecting nucleotide accessibility to the binding site. Although human Cdc37 binds to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90, nematodal Cdc37 preferentially interacts with the middle domain of CeHsp90 and hHsp90, exposing two Cdc37 interaction sites. A previously unreported site in CeCdc37 is utilized for the middle domain interaction. Dephosphorylation of CeCdc37 by the Hsp90-associated phosphatase PPH-5, a step required during the kinase activation process, proceeds normally, even if only the new interaction site is used. This shows that the second interaction site is also functionally relevant and highlights that Cdc37, similar to the Hsp90 cofactors Sti1 and Aha1, may utilize two different attachment sites to restrict the conformational freedom and the ATP turnover of Hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W1983875914,"Antiretroviral treatment (ART) has been introduced in Ethiopia a decade ago and continues to be scaled up. However, there is dearth of literature on the impact of ART on changes in CD4 lymphocyte count and weight among patients on treatment.To determine the predictors of change in CD4 lymphocyte count and weight among HIV/AIDS infected patients taking antiretroviral treatment in eastern Ethiopia.A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV/AIDS patients taking ART from 2005 to 2010. A sample of 1540 HIV infected adult patients who started antiretroviral therapy in hospitals located in eastern Ethiopia were included in the study. The primary outcomes of interest were changes in CD4 count and weight. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression analyses were performed to examine the outcomes among the cohort.Both the median CD4 lymphocyte counts and weight showed improvements in the follow up periods. The multivariate analysis shows that the duration of ART was an important predictor of improvements in CD4 lymphocyte count (beta 7.91; 95% CI 7.48-8.34; p 0.000) and weight (beta 0.15; 95% CI 0.13-0.18; p 0.000). Advanced WHO clinical stage, lower baseline CD4 cell count, and baseline hemoglobin levels were factors associated with decline in weight. Actively working patients had higher CD4 lymphocyte count and weight compared to those that were ambulatory (p<0.05).We detected a substantial increment in weight and CD4 lymphocyte count among the patients who were taking ART in eastern Ethiopia. Patients who are of older age, with low initial CD4 lymphocyte count, late stage of the WHO clinical stages and lower hemoglobin level may need special attention. The reasons for the improved findings on CD4 count and weight throughout the five years of follow up merit further investigation."

Metastasis, a complex process involving cell growth, tumor cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis (1Nguyen D.X. Massagué J. Genetic determinants of cancer metastasis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the molecular targets that can prevent cancer metastasis. Although tumor suppressor genes are thought to work in concert to inhibit cancer (2Shorning B.Y.

In 2000, we identified a novel protein, Nischarin, as an α5 binding protein (4Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L. Nischarin, a novel protein that interacts with the integrin α5 subunit and inhibits cell migration.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1141-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Nischarin is a cytosolic protein that binds preferentially to the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin α5. The Nischarin gene has been mapped to chromosome 3p21, a metastatis suppressor locus that is lost in several types of cancer (5Kok K. Naylor S.L. Buys C.H. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 3 in solid tumors and the search for suppressor genes.Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 27-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are the best studied members of the Rho GTPase family. Respectively, they stimulate actin stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia formation and are likely to be involved in integrin-mediated control of actin organization. Nischarin inhibits Rac-induced migration and invasion in breast and colon epithelial cells (6Alahari S.K.

High expression of PAK is detected in several breast tumor types, and activation of PAK leads to increased DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth (7Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mazumdar A. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. LIM kinase 1 increases tumor metastasis of human breast cancer cells via regulation of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator system.Int. J.

Moreover, PAKs phosphorylate and activate LIM kinase (LIMK), leading to increased phosphorylation of cofilin, which is important in regulating actin turnover. Inactivation of cofilin by phosphorylation results in the polymerization of actin filaments, which leads to increased migration and invasion. Earlier, we showed that Nischarin inhibits cell migration by inhibiting PAK1 and inhibiting LIMK1 (9Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L.

Nischarin inhibits LIM kinase to regulate cofilin phosphorylation and cell invasion.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3742-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, we have shown that overexpression of Nischarin inhibits breast tumor growth and metastasis (11Baranwal S. Wang Y. Rathinam R. Lee J. Jin L. McGoey R. Pylayeva Y. Giancotti F. Blobe G.C.

Thus, the tumor suppressor activity of Nischarin is associated with its ability to influence the signaling of cytoskeletal regulators.

LKB1 acts as a multitasking tumor suppressor (18Alessi D.R. Sakamoto K. Bayascas J.R. LKB1-dependent signaling pathways.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 137-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). It has a well established role in cell polarity (19Kemphues K.J. Priess J.R. Morton D.G. Cheng N.S.

The LKB1 tumor suppressor negatively regulates mTOR signaling.Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the LKB1 protein in breast cancer cells significantly inhibited tumor growth (21Zhuang Z.G. Di G.H. Shen Z.Z. Ding J. Shao Z.M. Enhanced expression of LKB1 in breast cancer cells attenuates angiogenesis, invasion, and metastatic potential.Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Together, these findings show that LKB1 is an important tumor suppressor. LIP1 (LKB1-interacting protein) was identified as the first LKB1-binding protein. LIP1 is a cytoplasmic protein; its most notable feature is the presence of six tandem copies of a leucine-rich repeat motif toward the N terminus. Intriguingly, LIP1 is structurally similar to Nischarin (22Smith D.P. Rayter S.I. Niederlander C. Spicer J. Jones C.M. Ashworth A. LIP1, a cytoplasmic protein functionally linked to the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome kinase LKB1.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both proteins are expressed in a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm of cells (4Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L.

(23Deguchi A. Miyoshi H. Kojima Y. Okawa K. Aoki M. Taketo M.M. LKB1 suppresses p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) by phosphorylation of Thr109 in the p21-binding domain.J. Biol.

Based on the structural similarities between Nischarin and LIP1 and the apparent correlation of tumor suppressors LKB1 and Nischarin in regulating breast cancer, we hypothesized that there is a biochemical and functional link between these two tumor suppressors. Here we present the first evidence of that interaction. We evaluated the combined effect of Nischarin and LKB1 expression on migration, anchorage-independent growth, tumor formation, and, most importantly, metastasis of highly invasive breast cancer cells. We found that Nischarin and LKB1 cooperate to inhibit tumor cell migration. In addition, we have shown that the inhibition of cell migration is associated with down-regulation of PAK1 and LIMK1. Notably, this is the first evidence of the tumor suppressor LKB1 inhibiting LIMK1 and cofilin. We also found that Nischarin and LKB1 have an enhanced effect in regulating anchorage-independent growth, tumor growth, and metastasis. Considering the importance of LKB1 and Nischarin in metastasis, these findings will be important in determining the role of the LKB1-Nischarin interaction in breast cancer and will provide a foundation for subsequent preclinical and clinical studies. For Nischarin-LKB1 domain binding experiments, 293T cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg each of various LKB1 deletion constructs, Myc-Nischarin deletion constructs, and full-length Myc-Nischarin or full-length LKB1 using GeneExpressoTM Max transfection reagent. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were lysed in FLAG lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with appropriate antibodies and immunoblotted. Detailed information about antibodies is included in the supplemental materials. For endogenous coimmunoprecipitation, MCF7, MCF10A, or MDA-MB-231 Nischarin cells were lysed in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and the lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with appropriate antibodies or a control IgG (Sigma) at 4 °C and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. 75,000 cells were seeded onto the upper chamber of 12-well Transwell plates. Medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber and served as a chemoattractant. Twelve hours later, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by gently wiping with a cotton swab. The cells that had migrated to the Transwell were fixed and stained with crystal violet. Migrated cells were visualized by microscope. For rescue experiments, 5 μg of dominant-negative LIMK1 D460N expression vector was cotransfected with 1 μg of pRC β-Gal plasmid (Stratagene). β-Galactosidase-positive cells that migrated through the membrane during a 14-h incubation were counted by staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). For mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich) treatment, the cells were incubated with mitomycin C (10 μg/ml) for 2 h before placing on top of the Transwells. Different subsets of 231 cells were trypsinized and plated onto collagen-1-coated plates. Real time migration was performed (24Jain P. Worthylake R.A. Alahari S.K. Quantitative analysis of random migration of cells using time-lapse video microscopy.J. Vis. Exp. 2012; 63: e3585Google Scholar). Briefly, ample space for random migration was created by scraping with a pipette tip. Phase contrast images of cells were taken at 1-h intervals for 19 h using an Olympus IX71 microscope with a 10× objective. The cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using a Live Cell Environmental Chamber (NEUE Group, Ontario, NY). Cell position in sequential images was determined using slide book software, and x-y coordinates of individual cells were plotted with starting points adjusted to (0, 0). Total displacement and average speed were calculated using slide book software. This assay was done as described previously (25Zhang S. Schafer-Hales K. Khuri F.R. Zhou W. Vertino P.M. Marcus A.I. The tumor suppressor LKB1 regulates lung cancer cell polarity by mediating cdc42 recruitment and activity.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To image Golgi positioning, the cells were fixed at 6 h postwounding and stained for Golgi and nuclei as described in the immunofluorescence method in the supplemental materials. All cells with the Golgi facing the wound front were scored positive. Different subsets of 231 (mentioned in Table 1) cells were suspended in 0.3% agarose in 2× DMEM + 20% FBS at a density of 50,000 cells/well and plated on a layer of 0.5% agarose in 2] DMEM + 20% FBS (in triplicate). The soft agar assay for MCF10A (supplemental Table S1) was performed similarly with 100,000 cells with complete MCF10A media. After 6 weeks, the colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and images were taken. The colony numbers were visually calculated.TABLE 1Expression of Nischarin and LKB1 in various MDA-MB-231 cell linesCell linesLKB1NischarinMDA-MB-231 + scrambled shRNA+−MDA-MB-231 Nischarin + scrambled shRNA++MDA-MB-231 + LKB1 shRNA−−MDA-MB-231 Nischarin + LKB1 shRNA−+ Open table in a new tab This was done by staining with propidium iodide as described (26Wang Y.

Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Louisiana State University Health Science Center. Tumorigenicity assays were done as described previously (27Dong M. How T. Kirkbride K.C. Gordon K.J. Lee J.D. Hempel N. Kelly P. Moeller B.J. Marks J.R. Blobe G.C.

We implanted 100,000 MDA-MB-231 cells in 50% (v/v) Matrigel into the axillary mammary gland of 7-week-old virgin female BALB/c/nu/nu mice (n = 4). Starting at 3 days after implantation, growth of the tumors was measured with a caliper in two dimensions on a weekly basis for a total of 5 weeks and expressed as (length × width2) × 0.5. All of the experiments were repeated three times. The results were presented as the means ± S.E. After 5 weeks of transplantation, the tumors were isolated. Balb c/nu/nu mice were maintained as per the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of this institution, and metastasis assays were done as described (26Wang Y. Shenouda S. Baranwal S. Rathinam R. Jain P. Bao L. Hazari S. Dash S. Alahari S.K.

Briefly, 1 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of PBS were injected into nude mice by lateral tail vein injection. Three mice were used for each group, and the experiment was repeated three times. Lentiviral LKB1 shRNA constructs and a scramble control construct were created in the same vector system (pLKO1) (Open Biosystems). Lentivirus stocks were prepared following the manufacturer's protocol as done previously (28Zhong D. Liu X. Khuri F.R. Sun S.Y. Vertino P.M. Zhou W. LKB1 is necessary for Akt-mediated phosphorylation of proapoptotic proteins.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 7270-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These procedures are described in greater detail in the supplemental materials. The mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were isolated and fixed with Z-Fix solution overnight. Paraffin blocks of tumor sections were prepared, sectioned, and stained for hematoxylin and eosin and Ki67 in the Morphology and Immunology Core Facility at Louisiana State University Health Science Center. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Statistical analysis for cell migration, anchorage-independent growth, Ki67 staining, and tumorigenicity was done using a nonparametric two-tailed t test. Nischarin is structurally similar to LKB1-binding protein LIP1 (22Smith D.P. Rayter S.I. Niederlander C. Spicer J. Jones C.M. Ashworth A. LIP1, a cytoplasmic protein functionally linked to the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome kinase LKB1.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2869-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether Nischarin could potentially interact with LKB1 in vivo. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with Myc-Nischarin or Myc-β-gal along with FLAG-LKB1. Total lysates prepared from these cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and blotted for Nischarin using anti-Myc antibody. LKB1 immunoprecipitated Nischarin, but not β-gal (Fig. 1A). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations of Myc-Nischarin with the anti-Myc antibody also coimmunoprecipitated FLAG-LKB1 (Fig. 1B), whereas negative control β-gal did not bind to FLAG-LKB1. These results indicate that Nischarin and LKB1 interact in vivo. This is the first report showing interaction between LKB1 and Nischarin. To determine whether the interaction between Nischarin and LKB1 is physiologically relevant and not due to an artifact of Nischarin and LKB1 overexpression, coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed using MCF7 and MCF10A, which endogenously express both Nischarin and LKB1. LKB1 immunoprecipitated Nischarin (Fig. 1C); reciprocal immunoprecipitations of Nischarin also immunoprecipitated LKB1 (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we determined the interaction in an invasive cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 stably expressing Nischarin (MDA-MB-231 Nischarin cells) (11Baranwal S. Wang Y. Rathinam R. Lee J. Jin L. McGoey R. Pylayeva Y. Giancotti F. Blobe G.C. Alahari S.K. Molecular characterization of the tumor-suppressive function of Nischarin in breast cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2011; 103: 1513-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). LKB1 immunoprecipitated Nischarin in these cells as well (Fig. 1E), indicating that the interaction is physiologically relevant. To further investigate the interaction between Nischarin and LKB1, we examined their localization in MDA-MB-231 Nischarin cells (11Baranwal S. Wang Y. Rathinam R. Lee J. Jin L. McGoey R. Pylayeva Y. Giancotti F. Blobe G.C. Alahari S.K. Molecular characterization of the tumor-suppressive function of Nischarin in breast cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2011; 103: 1513-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. It was observed that Nischarin and LKB1 colocalize in the cytosol in MDA-MB-231 Nischarin cells (Fig. 1F) and MCF7 cells (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that their interaction occurs in cytoplasm. To determine the functional consequence of Nischarin binding on LKB1 activity, we transfected Myc-Nischarin with FLAG-LKB1 or FLAG-LKB1 with vector control in 293T cells and did a kinase assay using the FLAG immunoprecipitates. The activity of LKB1 in the absence or presence of Nischarin was evaluated by measuring transphosphorylation of myelin basic protein (29Baas A.F. Boudeau J. Sapkota G.P. Smit L. Medema R. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Clevers H.C. Activation of the tumour suppressor kinase LKB1 by the STE20-like pseudokinase STRAD.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3062-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), a nonspecific exogenous substrate of LKB1 in presence of [γ-32P]ATP. LKB1 with vector control showed very low myelin basic protein phosphorylation, whereas in the presence of Nischarin, LKB1 phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was increased, indicating that Nischarin increases LKB1 activity (supplemental Fig. S2). We mapped the region of Nischarin that interacts with LKB1. Different Myc-tagged Nischarin deletion constructs, including the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, were used for coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 2A). We found that the N terminus of Nischarin amino acids (A.A.) 1–802, but not the C terminus of Nischarin (A.A. 970–1354), interacts with LKB1 (Fig. 2B). To further narrow down the region within the N terminus Nischarin, we did interaction assays using four different deletion constructs of Nischarin (Fig. 2A), finding that only the fragment A.A. 416–624 interacted with LKB1 (Fig. 2C). This indicated that region 416–624 was critical for the interaction with LKB1. We wished to identify the regions of LKB1 required for its association with Nischarin. Thus, we used FLAG-tagged deletion constructs of LKB1 (Fig. 3A) in coimmunoprecipitation assays to assess the ability of these fragments to bind full-length Myc-tagged Nischarin. The region containing A.A. 44–436 interacted most strongly; other N-terminal fragments (A.A. 44–309 and 1–309) weakly interacted (Fig. 3B). The C terminus of LKB1 did not interact with Nischarin, suggesting that the interaction of LKB1 with Nischarin occurs through the N terminus of Nischarin and N-terminal kinase domain of LKB1. Our previous work shows that Nischarin inhibits cell migration in several cell types (4Alahari S.K. Lee J.W. Juliano R.L.

Nischarin inhibits Rac induced migration and invasion of epithelial cells by affecting signaling cascades involving PAK.Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Others have shown that LKB1 inhibits migration in esophageal and colorectal cancer cell lines (23Deguchi A. Miyoshi H. Kojima Y. Okawa K. Aoki M. Taketo M.M. LKB1 suppresses p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) by phosphorylation of Thr109 in the p21-binding domain.J. Biol.

Altered LKB1/CREB-regulated transcription co-activator (CRTC) signaling axis promotes esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because either LKB1 or Nischarin alone regulates cell migration, we hypothesized that expression of LKB1 and Nischarin together may enhance their ability to inhibit migration. To test this, we manipulated LKB1 and Nischarin expression using shRNA or ectopic expression of cDNA to generate cell lines with suppression or overexpression of each protein alone or both together (Table 1; detailed in the supplemental text) in MDA-MB-231 cells (hereafter referred to as 231). This panel of cell lines was then used to test whether LKB1 and Nischarin work cooperatively to regulate cell migration. Expression and knockdown of these proteins were confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). We assessed the role of Nischarin and LKB1 on cell motility using time lapse microscopy of 231 cells during random migration, which enabled us to quantify migration speed and displacement. 231 cells that express both Nischarin and LKB1 (231 Nischarin) (supplemental Movie S1) exhibited a significant decrease in the speed of cell migration and displacement as compared with 231 cells expressing either Nischarin alone (231 Nischarin + LKB1 shRNA) (supplemental Movie S2) or LKB1 alone (231) (supplemental Movie S3). Conversely, the absence of both Nischarin and LKB1 significantly enhanced cell migration speed and displacement (231 LKB1 shRNA) (supplemental Movie S4 and Fig. 4, B and C). We also analyzed the effect of Nischarin and LKB1 on cell migration using a Transwell assay. The previously used cell lines (Table 1) were allowed to migrate toward serum for 12 h. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), expression of both Nischarin and LKB1 (231 Nischarin) dramatically inhibited cell migration (Fig. 4D), whereas cell lines expressing either Nischarin (231 Nisch + LKB1 shRNA) or LKB1 (231) alone were less effective than when both Nischarin and LKB1 (231 Nischarin) were present. Conversely, the absence of both Nischarin and LKB1 (231 LKB1 shRNA) led to a remarkable increase in migration. To determine whether the effect of Nischarin and LKB1 on cell migration might be caused by an indirect effect on cell proliferation, migration was measured after treatment with the proliferation inhibitor mitomycin C. We obtained the same effect on migration (supplemental Fig. S3) in the presence and absence of mitomycin C, suggesting that the effects are independent of proliferation and directly caused by cell migration. We also confirmed our results in the Transwell migration assay using a completely independent LKB1 siRNA oligonucleotide sequence (supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that the enhanced migration is specifically due to suppression of LKB1. It should be noted that the Transwell assay is an end point measurement of migration, whereas the random migration assay measures migration over time, providing complementary approaches to assess the effects on cell migration. Both of these approaches clearly showed that a combination of Nischarin with LKB1 is more effective in inhibiting c"

Skeletal muscle development is controlled by regulation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation into muscle fibers. Growth factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in numerous tissues, including skeletal muscle. Transcriptional regulation of FGFR1 gene expression is developmentally regulated by the Sp1 transcription factor, a member of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcriptional regulators. Here, we show that another KLF transcription factor, KLF10, also regulates myoblast proliferation and FGFR1 promoter activity. Expression of KLF10 reduced myoblast proliferation by 86%. KLF10 expression also significantly reduced FGFR1 promoter activity in myoblasts and Sp1-mediated FGFR1 promoter activity in Drosophila SL2 cells. Southwestern blot, electromobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that KLF10 bound to the proximal Sp factor binding site of the FGFR1 promoter and reduced Sp1 complex formation with the FGFR1 promoter at that site. These results indicate that KLF10 is an effective repressor of myoblast proliferation and represses FGFR1 promoter activity in these cells via an Sp1 binding site."

The effects were concentration dependent with half-maximal inhibition at 0.3 μM. Cystatin C also inhibited osteoclast formation when RANKL-stimulated osteoclasts were cultured on bone, leading to decreased formation of resorption pits. RANKL-stimulated cells retained characteristics of phagocytotic macrophages when cotreated with cystatin C. Three other cysteine proteinase inhibitors, cystatin D, Z-RLVG-CHN2 (IC50 0.1 μM), and E-64 (IC50 3 μM), also inhibited osteoclast formation in RANKL-stimulated macrophages. In addition, cystatin C, Z-RLVG-CHN2, and E-64 inhibited osteoclastic differentiation of RANKL-stimulated CD14+ human monocytes. The effect by cystatin C on differentiation of bone marrow macrophages was exerted at an early stage after RANKL stimulation and was associated with early (4 h) inhibition of c-Fos expression and decreased protein and nuclear translocation of c-Fos. Subsequently, p52, p65, IκBα, and Nfatc1 mRNA were decreased. Cystatin C was internalized in osteoclast progenitors, a process requiring RANKL stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2141801963,"Bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) either promote or inhibit cancer progression, depending on factors that heretofore have been undefined. Here we have utilized extreme hypoxia (0.5% O2) and concurrent treatment with metal carcinogen (nickel) to evaluate the passage-dependent response of hMSCs toward cancerous transformation. Effects of hypoxia and nickel treatment on hMSC proliferation, apoptosis, gene and protein expression, replicative senescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS), redox mechanisms, and in vivo tumor growth were analyzed. The behavior of late passage hMSCs in a carcinogenic hypoxia environment follows a profile similar to that of transformed cancer cells (i.e., increased expression of oncogenic proteins, decreased expression of tumor suppressor protein, increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and aberrant redox mechanisms), but this effect was not observed in earlier passage control cells. These events resulted in accumulated intracellular ROS in vitro and excessive proliferation in vivo. We suggest a mechanism by which carcinogenic hypoxia modulates the activity of three critical transcription factors (c-MYC, p53, and HIF1), resulting in accumulated ROS and causing hMSCs to undergo cancer-like behavioral changes. This is the first study to utilize carcinogenic hypoxia as an environmentally relevant experimental model for studying the age-dependent cancerous transformation of hMSCs.— Crowder, S. W., Horton, L.

https://openalex.org/W2158625215,"Regulation of leukocyte activation is critical to limit unintended tissue injury during acute inflammation. On neutrophil activation, polyisoprenyl diphosphate phosphatase 1 (PDP1) rapidly converts presqualene diphosphate to presqualene monophosphate to facilitate cell activation. Lipoxins are potent anti-inflammatory mediators for neutrophils, yet their counterregulatory signaling mechanisms remain to be determined. 15-Epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4) blocked agonist-initiated association of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase components p47(PHOX) and p22(PHOX) in human neutrophils. 15-Epi-LXA4 (0.1-100 nM) inhibited neutrophil superoxide anion (O2(-)) generation in a concentration- and ALX/FPR2 receptor-dependent manner that was disrupted by PDP1-specific antibodies. In differentiated HL60 cells, a myeloid cell line, agonist-initiated O2(-) generation was inhibited by PDP1 siRNA. Recombinant human PDP1 was directly phosphorylated in vitro by select protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, including PKCβII. When neutrophils were exposed to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), PKCβII was rapidly phosphorylated and physically associated with PDP1. Agonist-initiated conversion of neutrophil presqualene diphosphate to presqualene monophosphate was blocked by PKCβII inhibition. Neutrophil exposure to 15-epi-LXA4 attenuated fMLP triggered PKCβII phosphorylation and its interactions with PDP1. Together, these findings indicate that PDP1 serves an integral signaling role in neutrophil proinflammatory responses and as a target for counter-regulatory mediators."

Here, we identify an ankyrin-B-specific linker peptide connecting the ankyrin repeat domain to the ZU52-UPA module that inhibits binding of ankyrin-B to membrane protein partners E-cadherin and neurofascin 186 and prevents association of ankyrin-B with epithelial lateral membranes as well as neuronal plasma membranes.

The vertebrate ankyrin family contains three members, ankyrin-R, ankyrin-B, and ankyrin-G, that are encoded by distinct genes (ANK 1, 2, and 3) with distinct cellular location and functions (1Bennett V.

Zhang Y. Molecular evolution of the ankyrin gene family.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2006; 23: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The N-terminal ANK repeat domain (membrane-binding domain) is involved in diverse protein-protein interactions (3Bennett V. Healy J.

The ankyrin-B C-terminal domain determines activity of ankyrin-B/G chimeras in rescue of abnormal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor distribution in ankyrin-B (−/−) neonatal cardiomyocytes.J.

The ZU52-UPA module determines the distal axonal localization of ankyrin-B in neurons (19Galiano M.R. Jha S. Ho T.S. Zhang C. Ogawa Y. Chang K.J. Stankewich M.C. Mohler P.J. Rasband M.N.

Here, we adopted a comprehensive domain substitution strategy to determine effects of exchanging domains or unstructured regions between ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G on their ability to associate with epithelial lateral membranes. This systematic approach led to identification of a heretofore unrecognized ankyrin-B-specific linker peptide connecting the ANK repeats and ZU52-UPA module that prevents association of ankyrin-B with plasma membranes of epithelial cells and neurons through intramolecular association with ANK repeats. Dynabeads® protein G for immunoprecipitation (catalog no. 10004D) and Lipofectamine® 2000 transfection reagent (catalog no. 11668-027) were purchased from Invitrogen. QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kits (catalog no. 200522) were purchased from Agilent Technologies. Mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (catalog no. H6908) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was laboratory-generated. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ankyrin-B or anti-ankyrin-G antibody was generated using the C-terminal domain as antigen. The first generation of chimeric GFP-tagged ankyrin-B/G constructs was described previously (11Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. The ankyrin-B C-terminal domain determines activity of ankyrin-B/G chimeras in rescue of abnormal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor distribution in ankyrin-B (−/−) neonatal cardiomyocytes.J.

In ankyrin-B, the linker region was defined as amino acids 848–960, the ZU5 domains were defined as amino acids 961–1287, and the UPA domain was defined as amino acids 1288–1443. In ankyrin-G, the linker region was defined as amino acids 874–984, the ZU5 domains were defined as amino acids 985–1312, and the UPA domain was defined as amino acids 1313–1476. Two restriction sites, SphI and SpeI, were introduced after the linker region and the second ZU5 domain, respectively. The corresponding regions in ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B were exchanged using standard cloning protocols. 105 Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were plated on MatTek plates, and the next day the cells were transfected with 50 ng of plasmids using Lipofectamine® 2000 following the recommended protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min followed by a 30-min blocking in PBS buffer containing 4% bovine serum albumin. Then cells were incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The next day, cells were washed with PBS buffer three times and then incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 568, or 663) at room temperature for 2 h. Fluorescent antibody labeling was visualized using Zeiss LSM 510 or 780 laser scanning microscopes. Images were collected using a ×63 numerical aperture 1.4 objective lens, and XZ planes were reconstructed from Z stacks with optical sections of 0.5 μm. This assay was reported previously (20Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. Structural requirements for association of neurofascin with ankyrin.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 105 HEK293 cells were plated in collagen-coated MatTek plates. The next day, cells were cotransfected with 100 ng HA-tagged neurofascin-186 or E-cadherin plasmids and 80 ng GFP-tagged chimeric ankyrin plasmids. 24 h later, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. 6 × 106 293T cells were plated in 10-cm dishes, and the next day cells were cotransfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA encoding the HA-tagged ANK repeat domain of ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G with 2 μg of plasmid DNA encoding GFP-tagged B-linker. 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm NaEDTA, 0.32 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml AEBSF, 30 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) (pH 7.4)) by passage through a 27-gauge needle. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 105 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected and incubated with protein G dynabeads preloaded with anti-GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitation samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Neurons and medium were prepared as described (21Baranes D. Lederfein D. Huang Y.Y. Chen M. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R.

Briefly, hippocampi of postnatal day 0 mouse pups were isolated, treated with trypsin, and then gently triturated through a glass pipette with a fire-polished tip. The dissociated cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine- and laminin-coated MatTek dishes in Neurobasal-A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, B27 supplement, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. On the following day, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free Neurobasal-A medium containing B27, glutamine, and Ara-C. Cultured hippocampal neurons at day 5 were transfected with 50 ng of chimeric ankyrin plasmids following the standard protocol. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% PFA with 4% sucrose and processed for immunostaining as described above. The immunofluorescence intensities of plasma membrane or cytoplasmic staining were measured using ImageJ. The intensity ratios were calculated and analyzed using GraphPad Prism 6. Student's t tests or one-way ANOVA 2The abbreviations used are: ANOVA, analysis of variance; HBE, human bronchial epithelial; AnkB, ankyrin-B; AnkG, ankyrin-G; ANK, ankyrin. with Tukey's post hoc tests were performed for hypothesis testing. Cultured epithelial cells require ankyrin-G for biogenesis of their lateral membranes (22Kizhatil K. Bennett V.

Ankyrin-G, in turn, requires interaction with βII-spectrin as well as palmitoylation for its function in lateral membrane biosynthesis (4He M. Jenkins P. Bennett V.

Ankyrin-B recruits β-2 spectrin to an intracellular compartment in neonatal cardiomyocytes (7Mohler P.J. Yoon W. Bennett V.

Chem. 2004; 279: 40185-40193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but ankyrin-B has not been studied in epithelial cells. Therefore, we used human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells to compare the localization of ankyrin-G and ankyrin-B. We first determined the expression and localization of endogenous ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G in HBE cells. An antibody against the C-terminal domain of ankyrin-B detected multiple spliced isoforms, including the 220-kDa isoform and a major 55-kDa isoform (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence showed no ankyrin-B immunoreactivity on the plasma membrane and, instead, revealed intracellular vesicles of unknown identity (Fig. 1A). Three major ankyrin-G isoforms (one at 210 kDa and two at 120 kDa) are expressed in HBE cells (Fig. 1B) and are mainly concentrated on the plasma membrane, consistent with previous findings (A) (4He M. Jenkins P. Bennett V. Cysteine 70 of ankyrin-G is S-palmitoylated and is required for function of ankyrin-G in membrane domain assembly.J. Biol.

We next compared the localization of transfected 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP and 190-kDa ankyrin-G-GFP in HBE cells. Fig. 1C is a schematic showing the structural details of ankyrin proteins, where ankyrin-B domains are highlighted in red and ankyrin-G domains are highlighted in green. 220-kDa ankyrin-B-GFP is excluded from the plasma membrane, whereas it is associated with vesicles in a similar pattern as endogenous ankyrin-B, and the 190-kDa ankyrin-G predominantly localizes to the lateral membrane (Fig. 1, D and E). To explore the molecular mechanism for the dramatic difference between plasma membrane localization of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G, we examined which domain is required for plasma membrane localization using B/G chimeras. We first used the previously generated ankyrin-B/G chimeric proteins containing all eight combinations of membrane-binding, spectrin-binding, and C-terminal domains (11Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. The ankyrin-B C-terminal domain determines activity of ankyrin-B/G chimeras in rescue of abnormal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor distribution in ankyrin-B (−/−) neonatal cardiomyocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the C-terminal region, which was reported to regulate the activity of ankyrin-B in neonatal cardiomyocytes (11Mohler P.J. Gramolini A.O. Bennett V. The ankyrin-B C-terminal domain determines activity of ankyrin-B/G chimeras in rescue of abnormal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptor distribution in ankyrin-B (−/−) neonatal cardiomyocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10599-10607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is not required for plasma membrane localization of ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G (, Fig. 2A–C, BBG and GGB). Instead, we found that the central spectrin-binding domain determines the specificity of ankyrin localization. Ankyrin-B, containing the ankyrin-G spectrin-binding domain (Fig. 2, A–C, BGB), efficiently targets the lateral membrane. Similarly, ankyrin-G, containing the ankyrin-B spectrin-binding domain, shows more intracellular localization (Fig. 2, A–C, GBG), even though it did not become completely intracellular. The spectrin-binding domain consists of a linker peptide, two ZU5 domains, and a UPA domain. The β spectrin-binding site has been mapped to the first ZU5 domain (23Kizhatil K. Yoon W. Mohler P.J. Davis L.H. Hoffman J.A. Bennett V. Ankyrin-G and β2-spectrin collaborate in biogenesis of lateral membrane of human bronchial epithelial cells.J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further explore the structural requirement for ankyrin localization in HBE cells, we made a second generation of ankyrin-B/G chimeric constructs in which we sequentially exchanged their linker peptides, ZU5 domains, and UPA domains. The sequence boundaries of each region were determined by the structure of the ZU52-UPA superdomain module of ankyrin-B (6Wang C. Yu C. Ye F. Wei Z. Zhang M. Structure of the ZU5-ZU5-UPA-DD tandem of ankyrin-B reveals interaction surfaces necessary for ankyrin function.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 4822-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We then compared the cellular localization of chimeras transfected into HBE cells. Interestingly, neither the ZU5 domains nor the UPA domain were required for localization of ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G because the chimeric proteins (B/ZU5G, B/UPAG, G/ZU5B, and G/UPAB) behaved the same as their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 3, A–C). However, exchange of the linker peptides (hereby referred to as the B-linker and G-linker for ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G, respectively) between ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G resulted in dramatic alteration of cellular localization. Ankyrin-B, containing the G-linker (B/LG), gained lateral membrane localization, whereas ankyrin-G containing the B-linker (G/LB) showed increased intracellular staining (Fig. 3, A–C). Because ankyrin-B targets the plasma membrane when its linker region is replaced with the G-linker, we initially hypothesized that the G-linker itself associates independently with the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, GFP-tagged G-linker was expressed in HBE cells. However, the G-linker alone showed no membrane localization (Fig. 4A). We next generated truncated constructs only including the ANK repeat domain and the linker region (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, the ANK repeat domain of either ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G was sufficient for lateral membrane targeting (ANKRB, ANKRG), and this membrane localization was not affected by addition of the G-linker (ANKRB/LG, ANKRG/LG) (Fig. 4, C and D). However, fusion of the B-linker to the C terminus of the ANK repeat domain efficiently blocked the lateral membrane binding activity of the ANK repeat domains of both ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G (ANKRB/LB, ANKRG/LB; Fig. 4, C and D). Given the fact that the B-linker inhibits lateral membrane targeting of the ANK repeat domain, the B-linker may interact directly with ANK repeats. To test this hypothesis, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay in which GFP-tagged B-linker was coexpressed with the HA-tagged ANK repeat domain of ankyrin-B or ankyrin-G. After immunoprecipitating the GFP-B-linker, we detected robust HA immunoreactivity, which indicated a strong interaction between the B-linker and the ANK repeat domain (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, an atomic structure of the C-terminal 12 ankyrin repeats of ankyrin-R, solved by Michaely and colleagues (26Michaely P. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Anderson R.G. Crystal structure of a 12 ANK repeat stack from human ankyrinR.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6387-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), showed that the ankyrin repeat solenoid contains an extended groove that associates with the endogenous C-terminal peptide corresponding to the B-linker (Fig. 4F). This model suggests an autoinhibitory mechanism where an unstructured B-linker polypeptide represses the activity of ANK repeat domain through association with the ANK repeat groove, thus competing with membrane partners. Ankyrin-G is the native partner for neurofascin 186 and binds to E-cadherin with a much higher affinity than ankyrin-B (27Kizhatil K. Davis J.Q. Davis L. Hoffman J. Hogan B.L. Bennett V.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in testing whether the B-linker functions by regulating the interaction of ankyrin-B with E-cadherin or neurofascin 186. We addressed this question using a previously reported cellular recruitment assay where coexpression of ankyrin-G with a membrane partner in HEK 293 cells results in recruitment of ankyrin-G from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (20Zhang X. Davis J.Q. Carpenter S. Bennett V. Structural requirements for association of neurofascin with ankyrin.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30785-30794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Ankyrin-B, when coexpressed with neurofascin 186 or E-cadherin, which both target to the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells, remained in the cytoplasm, indicating no interaction between ankyrin-B and neurofascin 186 or E-cadherin (Fig. 5, A and B). However, the chimeric ankyrin-B with the G-linker (B/LG) was efficiently recruited to the plasma membrane by both neurofascin 186 and E-cadherin (Fig. 5, A and B). These results imply that the B-linker suppresses the binding activity of ankyrin-B with neurofascin 186 and E-cadherin, probably through autoinhibition, as noted above. In contrast to its effects on ankyrin-B, the B-linker, when substituted for the G-linker, did not completely block the recruitment of ankyrin-G by neurofascin 186 or E-cadherin (Fig. 5, C and D). This result is consistent with the cellular localization results where the B-linker only partially prevents ankyrin-G from targeting the lateral membrane in HBE cells (Fig. 3, B and C). One explanation for the different sensitivities of ankyrin-B and ankyrin-G may be that the B-linker requires specific regions in the ANK repeat domain of ankyrin-B for an efficient intramolecular interaction and repression. Consistent with this interpretation, the coimmunoprecipitation assay shows greater binding between the B-linker and the ANK repeat domain of ankyrin-B than that of ankyrin-G (Fig. 4E). To identify critical regions required for the autoinhibition activity of the B-linker, we first truncated the C-terminal half (residues 891–960) of the B-linker and found that it still maintained its inhibitory activity (data not shown). Then we performed NAAIRS scanning mutagenesis on the N-terminal portion (residue 848–890) of the B-linker (30Marsilio E. Cheng S.H. Schaffhausen B. Paucha E. Livingston D.M. The T/t common region of simian virus 40 large T antigen contains a distinct transformation-governing sequence.J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5647-5652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Although there has been extensive research on how the neural and physiological systems respond to stressful stimulation, relatively little is known about how the brain dynamically copes with stress evoked by this stimulation. Here we investigated how stress is relieved by a popular coping behavior, namely, gum chewing. In an fMRI study, we used loud noise as an acute stressor and asked participants to rate their feeling of stress in gum-chewing and no-chewing conditions. The participants generally felt more stressful when hearing noise, but less so when they were simultaneously chewing gum. The bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the left anterior insula (AI) were activated by noise, and their activations showed a positive correlation with the self-reported feeling of stress. Critically, gum chewing significantly reduced the noise-induced activation in these areas. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis showed that the functional connectivity between the left AI and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) was increased by noise to a lesser extent when the participants were chewing gum than when not chewing gum. Dynamic causality modeling (DCM) demonstrated that gum chewing inhibited the connectivity from the STS to the left AI. These findings demonstrate that gum chewing relieves stress by attenuating the sensory processing of external stressor and by inhibiting the propagation of stress-related information in the brain stress network."
https://openalex.org/W2013367553,"The population of flesh-footed shearwaters (Puffinus carneipes) breeding on Lord Howe Island was shown to be declining from the 1970's to the early 2000's. This was attributed to destruction of breeding habitat and fisheries mortality in the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery. Recent evidence suggests these impacts have ceased; presumably leading to population recovery. We used Bayesian statistical methods to combine data from the literature with more recent, but incomplete, field data to estimate population parameters and trends. This approach easily accounts for sources of variation and uncertainty while formally incorporating data and variation from different sources into the estimate. There is a 70% probability that the flesh-footed shearwater population on Lord Howe continued to decline during 2003–2009, and a number of possible reasons for this are suggested. During the breeding season, road-based mortality of adults on Lord Howe Island is likely to result in reduced adult survival and there is evidence that breeding success is negatively impacted by marine debris. Interactions with fisheries on flesh-footed shearwater winter grounds should be further investigated."

https://openalex.org/W2093191751,"Modern treatment strategies have improved the prognosis of childhood ALL; however, treatment still fails in 25–30% of patients. Further improvement of treatment may depend on the development of targeted therapies. mTOR kinase, a central mediator of several signaling pathways, has recently attracted remarkable attention as a potential target in pediatric ALL. However, limited data exists about the activity of mTOR. In the present study, the amount of mTOR activity dependent phospho-proteins was characterized by ELISA in human leukemia cell lines and in lymphoblasts from childhood ALL patients (n = 49). Expression was measured before and during chemotherapy and at relapses. Leukemia cell lines exhibited increased mTOR activity, indicated by phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (p-4EBP1). Elevated p-4EBP1 protein levels were detected in ALL samples at diagnosis; efficacy of chemotherapy was followed by the decrease of mTOR activity dependent protein phosphorylation. Optical density (OD) for p-4EBP1 (ELISA) was significantly higher in patients with poor prognosis at diagnosis, and in the samples of relapsed patients. Our results suggest that measuring mTOR activity related phospho-proteins such as p-4EBP1 by ELISA may help to identify patients with poor prognosis before treatment, and to detect early relapses. Determining mTOR activity in leukemic cells may also be a useful tool for selecting patients who may benefit from future mTOR inhibitor treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2036023423,"Pyruvate export is an essential physiological process for the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei as the parasite would otherwise accumulate this end product of glucose metabolism to toxic levels. In the studies reported here, genetic complementation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been employed to identify a gene (TbPT0) that encodes this vital pyruvate transporter from T. brucei. Expression of TbPT0 in S. cerevisiae reveals that TbPT0 is a high affinity pyruvate transporter. TbPT0 belongs to a clustered multigene family consisting of five members, whose expression is up-regulated in the bloodstream form. Interestingly, TbPT family permeases are related to polytopic proteins from plants but not to characterized monocarboxylate transporters from mammals. Remarkably, inhibition of the TbPT gene family expression in bloodstream parasites by RNAi is lethal, confirming the physiological relevance of these transporters. The discovery of TbPT0 reveals for the first time the identity of the essential pyruvate transporter and provides a potential drug target against the mammalian life cycle stage of T. brucei."
https://openalex.org/W2079784785,"During hepatic lipogenesis, the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols originates from one of three sources: glucose, glycerol, or substrates passing through the citric acid cycle via glyceroneogenesis. The relative contribution of each substrate source to glycerol in rat liver acylglycerols was determined using 13C-enriched substrates and NMR. Animals received a fixed mixture of glucose, glycerol, and lactate; one group received [U-13C6]glucose, another received [U-13C3]glycerol, and the third received [U-13C3]lactate. After 3 h, the livers were harvested to extract fats, and the glycerol moiety from hydrolyzed acylglycerols was analyzed by 13C NMR. In either fed or fasted animals, glucose and glycerol provided the majority of the glycerol backbone carbons, whereas the contribution of lactate was small. In fed animals, glucose contributed >50% of the total newly synthesized glycerol backbone, and 35% of this contribution occurred after glucose had passed through the citric acid cycle. By comparison, the glycerol contribution was ∼40%, and of this, 17% of the exogenous glycerol passed first through the cycle. In fasted animals, exogenous glycerol became the major contributor to acylglycerols. The contribution from exogenous lactate did increase in fasted animals, but its overall contribution remained small. The contributions of glucose and glycerol that had passed through the citric acid cycle first increased in fasted animals from 35 to 71% for glucose and from 17 to 24% for glycerol. Thus, a substantial fraction from both substrate sources passed through the cycle prior to incorporation into the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols in the liver. During hepatic lipogenesis, the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols originates from one of three sources: glucose, glycerol, or substrates passing through the citric acid cycle via glyceroneogenesis.

It is well established that the glycerol moiety of triglycerides and other acylglycerols in adipose tissue can be derived directly from glucose (1Bally P.R. Cahill Jr., G.F. Leboeuf B. Renold A.E.

In the past decade, attention has turned to the sources of the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols in liver (5Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K.

Unlike adipose tissue, liver has the capacity to phosphorylate free glycerol via glycerol kinase to yield glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P), 2The abbreviation used is: G3Pglycerol 3-phosphate. which then becomes esterified with fatty acids. Thus, it is now generally accepted that the carbons in the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols synthesized in the liver are derived from three potential sources: glucose via glycolysis to the level of the triose phosphates, glycerol via glycerol kinase, or glyceroneogenesis from pyruvate and intermediates of the citric acid cycle (see Fig. 1A). glycerol 3-phosphate. Recently, studies with labeled water (2H2O or 3H2O) have been adapted for assessment of the relative contributions of the various sources to the glycerol backbone. In the presence of labeled water, the number of hydrogen atoms (2H or 3H) incorporated into glycerol will differ depending on the source of the glycerol moiety (5Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Glyceroneogenesis was defined as the synthesis of G3P from precursors other than glycerol or glucose, including pyruvate, lactate, alanine, and intermediates of the citric acid cycle (9Nye C.K. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C. Glyceroneogenesis is the dominant pathway for triglyceride glycerol synthesis in vivo in the rat.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). According to this definition, conversion of glucose to pyruvate followed by carboxylation to oxaloacetate and subsequent decarboxylation to phosphoenolpyruvate and metabolism back to the glycerol moiety would not be considered glyceroneogenesis. This pathway, illustrated in Fig. 1B, would be considered an indirect pathway from conversion of glucose carbons to the glycerol backbone after passing through the citric acid cycle. The total contribution of glucose to hepatic triglyceride-glycerol, defined as the sum of direct and indirect pathways, has been reported to be modest, ∼11–28% of total triglyceride-glycerol depending upon the nutritional state. In contrast to the total contribution from glucose, the contribution from glyceroneogenesis was reported to be much larger (∼60%) and to be independent of nutritional state (9Nye C.K. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C. Glyceroneogenesis is the dominant pathway for triglyceride glycerol synthesis in vivo in the rat.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Glyceroneogenesis was also reported to be increased in hepatic lipogenesis in the setting of type 2 diabetes as determined using the labeled water tracer method (10Kalhan S.C. Bugianesi E. McCullough A.J. Hanson R.W. Kelley D.E. Estimates of hepatic glyceroneogenesis in type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.Metabolism. 2008; 57: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These observations are not consistent with the conventional concept that glycolysis to the level of trioses is the major source for G3P needed for fatty acid esterification. The conclusion that glyceroneogenesis provided most of the glycerol backbone in hepatic acylglycerol production was based on a technique using 14C-labeled glucose in combination with tritiated water (3H2O) to quantify the contribution of glucose to the glycerol moiety via the citric acid cycle (9Nye C.K. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C. Glyceroneogenesis is the dominant pathway for triglyceride glycerol synthesis in vivo in the rat.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This indirect contribution of [U-14C6]glucose via lactate was estimated based on the appearance of triglyceride-[2,3-14C2]glycerol. However, this labeling pattern is not the only isotopomer produced by [U-14C6]glucose via lactate/pyruvate; triglyceride-[1,2-14C2]glycerol plus triglyceride-[U-14C3]glycerol may also be generated during passage through the citric acid cycle. Additional triglyceride-[1,2-14C2]glycerol formation may be possible because [2,3-14C2]G3P generated from the citric acid cycle is in the equilibrium of glycerol, a symmetric molecule, producing [1,2-14C2]G3P. This approach (9Nye C.K. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C. Glyceroneogenesis is the dominant pathway for triglyceride glycerol synthesis in vivo in the rat.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is important because it recognizes that labeled water tracers cannot distinguish glyceroneogenesis from glucose metabolism to the glycerol backbone via the citric acid cycle. However, this method may underestimate the contribution of glucose to the glycerol backbone through the indirect pathway because not all possible glycerol isotopomers are considered. In addition to glucose, glycerol via glycerol kinase has been believed to be a significant source of the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols in the liver. Nonetheless, the contribution of free glycerol to the glycerol backbone is often not measured or is reported as a minor contribution by use of the water tracer method (8Kalhan S.C. Mahajan S. Burkett E. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Glyceroneogenesis and the source of glycerol for hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis in humans.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12928-12931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 9Nye C.K. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C.

Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Like glucose, free glycerol could conceivably contribute to the glycerol backbone via cycling through the citric acid cycle. Free glycerol is in equilibrium with triose phosphates and can be metabolized to pyruvate, oxaloacetate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and gluconeogenesis. However, the contribution of free glycerol to the glycerol backbone after metabolism in the citric acid cycle (see Fig. 1C) has not been considered previously. Because fatty liver, defined as overproduction and storage of hepatic triglycerides, is a major and growing clinical problem (11Clark J.M. Brancati F.L. Diehl A.M. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 1649-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the contribution of each nutritional source of carbon to the glycerol backbone. Furthermore, it is important to develop a simple method using stable isotopes to quantify these pathways because studies with 3H and 14C are not acceptable for patients. Deuterated water (2H2O) can be given to humans (8Kalhan S.C. Mahajan S. Burkett E. Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Glyceroneogenesis and the source of glycerol for hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis in humans.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12928-12931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Kalhan S.C. Bugianesi E. McCullough A.J. Hanson R.W. Kelley D.E. Estimates of hepatic glyceroneogenesis in type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans.Metabolism. 2008; 57: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but as noted, glyceroneogenesis may be overestimated, and the glucose contribution may be underestimated using this technique. Here, we explored an alternative approach to examine the sources of glycerol in hepatic acylglycerols of whole animals using one of three 13C-enriched substrates: [U-13C6]glucose, [U-13C3]glycerol, or [U-13C3]lactate. 13C NMR analysis of glycerol hydrolyzed from liver fats enabled us to measure the independent contribution of each substrate to the glycerol backbone and also distinguishes between the direct versus indirect pathway contributions of glucose or glycerol to the glycerol moiety in the livers of whole animals. This study demonstrates that glucose and glycerol are indeed the main sources of the glycerol backbone but that a significant portion of this contribution occurs after metabolism of glucose or glycerol to the level of pyruvate, followed by carboxylation to oxaloacetate and subsequent synthesis to the glycerol backbone. Because the indirect pathway is detected as glyceroneogenesis by labeled water methods, the results from these earlier studies should be reinterpreted considering the possibility of cycling involved in glucose and glycerol contributions. [U-13C3]Glycerol (99%), [U-13C3]lactate (98%), and [U-13C6]glucose (99%) were obtained from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA). Dowex 50WX8–200 (a cation-exchange resin) and other common chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) were studied in two different nutritional states. One group had free access to food and water. The other group was fasted for 24 h with free access to water. All animals received an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of glucose (2 g/kg of body weight), glycerol (0.5 g/kg of body weight), and lactate (0.5 g/kg of body weight) under isoflurane anesthesia. Only one substrate was enriched in 13C in any given experiment, but all three substrates were present in each experiment. After the injection, rats were placed back into their cage, where they quickly awakened and were allowed free access to water. After 3 h, blood, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues were harvested under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and they were further processed for NMR analysis. Liver tissue (7–8 g) ground to a powder under liquid nitrogen was transferred into a beaker containing CHCl3/methanol (2:1, 40 ml). The mixture was stirred for 1 h and filtered using a Whatman filter paper. Deionized water (5 ml) was added, and the mixture was swirled manually for 1 min. The swirled mixture was allowed to settle at room temperature for organic-aqueous layer separation and further centrifuged at a low rpm for clear separation. The upper aqueous layer was aspirated, and the remaining organic layer was dried under a vacuum using a liquid nitrogen trap. The dried residue was dissolved in 4 ml of 1:1 1 n KOH and 90% methanol and incubated for 1 h at 70 °C with stirring. After incubation, hexane (8 ml) was added, and the sample was vortexed for 1 min. The mixture was centrifuged at a low rpm to separate the organic-aqueous layers. The upper layer containing fatty acids dissolved in hexane was aspirated. The bottom aqueous layer containing glycerol and glycerol phosphates was eluted through a cation exchange resin (2 ml) with deionized water (15 ml). The eluent was dried and dissolved in 2H2O (160 μl) for 13C NMR acquisition. Blood, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues were treated with perchloric acid to extract water-soluble components, neutralized with KOH, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was dried. The dried residue was dissolved in 2H2O (160 μl) for 13C NMR acquisition for the analysis of the citric acid cycle intermediates and exchanging pools. All NMR spectra were collected using a Varian INOVA 14.1 T spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a 3-mm broadband probe with the observe coil tuned to 13C (150 MHz). 13C NMR spectra were collected using a 60° pulse, a 36,765-Hz sweep width, 110,294 data points, and a 1.5-s acquisition time with 1.5-s interpulse delay at 25 °C. Proton decoupling was performed using a standard WALTZ-16 pulse sequence. Spectra were averaged over ∼3000–7000 scans requiring ∼3–6 h. All NMR spectra were analyzed using the ACD/Labs PC-based NMR spectral analysis program (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, Canada). Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were performed using Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. When a liver exposed to [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C3]glycerol is producing acylglycerols, the appearance of an intact three-carbon [U-13C3]glycerol backbone in the acylglycerol pool would reflect “direct” formation of G3P from one of these precursors. In contrast, if [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C3]glycerol is first metabolized to pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and the citric acid cycle before forming G3P (Fig. 1, B and C), doubly enriched ([1,2-13C2]glycerol and [2,3-13C2]glycerol) and uniformly enriched ([U-13C3]glycerol) isotopomers would then appear in the acylglycerol pool (Fig. 2). Hence, the appearance of [U-13C3]glycerol in the acylglycerol pool does not necessarily reflect the direct pathway from [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C3]glycerol. To estimate the contribution of carbon coming solely from the citric acid cycle, [U-13C3]lactate was included as a third tracer. In this case, any contribution from [U-13C3]lactate to the glycerol backbone must reflect conversion to [U-13C3]pyruvate, entry into the citric acid cycle, and exit from the cycle through phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase to phosphoenolpyruvate and consequently G3P. [U-13C3]Pyruvate can enter the citric acid cycle via the pyruvate carboxylase pathway or the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway (Fig. 2). [U-13C3]Pyruvate carboxylation to oxaloacetate produces [1,2,3-13C3]oxaloacetate, which fully equilibrates with a symmetric fumarate pool, producing [2,3,4-13C3]oxaloacetate. The conversion of [1,2,3-13C3]oxaloacetate and [2,3,4-13C3]oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate would result in [1,2-13C2]glycerol, [2,3-13C2]glycerol, and [U-13C3]glycerol in the acylglycerol pool (Fig. 2A). When the oxaloacetate isotopomers after equilibrium with fumarate undergo “forward” metabolism in the citric acid cycle, doubly labeled oxaloacetate ([1,2,-13C2]oxaloacetate and [3,4-13C2]oxaloacetate) isotopomers are produced after one complete turn of the cycle. The doubly enriched oxaloacetate isotopomers would produce [1,2-13C2]glycerol, [2,3-13C2]glycerol, [1-13C1]glycerol, and [3-13C1]glycerol in the acylglycerol pool (Fig. 2A). Alternatively, entry of [U-13C3]pyruvate into the citric acid cycle through the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway produces [4,5-13C2]citrate after condensation with unlabeled oxaloacetate (Fig. 2B). The forward turn of the citrate isotopomer through the cycle produces the same doubly labeled oxaloacetate isotopomers ([1,2-13C2]oxaloacetate and [3,4-13C2]oxaloacetate), resulting in [1,2-13C2]glycerol, [2,3-13C2]glycerol, [1-13C1]glycerol, and [3-13C1]glycerol in the acylglycerol pool. The fate of [U-13C3]pyruvate through pyruvate carboxylase versus pyruvate dehydrogenase (i.e. acetyl-CoA) was confirmed by inspecting the labeling patterns of the citric acid cycle intermediates and exchanging pools. Fig. 3 shows the 13C NMR spectra of liver extracts from three groups of rats given a mixture of glucose, glycerol, and lactate (only one enriched in 13C). The resonances of succinate, glutamate, and glutamine are shown. Succinate is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, whereas glutamate and glutamine are in exchange with α-ketoglutarate, another intermediate of the citric acid cycle. Each metabolite contained a higher enrichment of 13C above natural abundance levels (as indicated by the singlet component in each resonance). This verifies that all three labeled substrates, [U-13C6]glucose, [U-13C3]glycerol, and [U-13C3]lactate, entered the citric acid cycle prior to formation of the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols. The appearance of triply labeled succinate ([1,2,3-13C3]succinate and [2,3,4-13C3]succinate), [2,3-13C2]glutamate, or [2,3-13C2]glutamine in all spectra provides direct evidence for entry of [U-13C3]pyruvate largely through pyruvate carboxylase (Figs. 2A and 3). The presence of a small amount of [4,5-13C2]glutamate in some spectra reflects the flux of carbons into the cycle via pyruvate dehydrogenase (Figs. 2B and 3). The ratio of doubly labeled to uniformly labeled glycerol in acylglycerols after the entry of [U-13C3]pyruvate into the citric acid cycle is easily obtained by direct readout of multiplet areas in the glycerol C2 resonance of acylglycerols. In experiments with [U-13C3]lactate, the doublet and triplet areas in glycerol C2 (singlet not included) were 63.6 ± 0.6% and 36.4 ± 0.6% (n = 6) (Fig. 4A), respectively, in fed animals. Essentially the same result was obtained in fasted animals given [U-13C3]lactate; the doublet and triplet areas were 64.1 ± 0.4% and 35.9 ± 0.4%, respectively (n = 6) (Fig. 4B). Given the assumption that this ratio is identical in all other experiments (independent of which substrate is enriched with 13C), then, the ratio can be used to evaluate the total carbon contribution to the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols coming from the citric acid cycle (the “indirect” pathway) in all other experiments. As an example, the C2 resonance of glycerol isolated from the liver acylglycerols of a fed rat given [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate showed five resonance components: a singlet (S), a doublet (D), and a triplet (T) (Fig. 5A). The singlet was assumed to arise only from the natural abundance endogenous glycerol backbone, so it was not included in further calculations. In this particular spectrum, D/(D + T) = 22%, whereas T/(D + T) = 78%. The doublet component reflects the sum of [1,2-13C2]glycerol and [2,3-13C2]glycerol isotopomers and hence could arise only from the indirect pathway of [U-13C6]glucose via the citric acid cycle. The triplet component reflects only [U-13C3]glycerol, but this isotopomer could arise from either the direct or indirect pathway. As noted above, because fed animals given glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate showed a constant T/D ratio (36/64 = 0.56) in the glycerol C2 resonance, the fraction of the triplet resulting from the indirect pathway in the [U-13C6]glucose experiment was then estimated at 12% (22% × 0.56). Consequently, the triplet portion from the direct pathway is 78 − 12% = 66%, whereas the indirect contribution of [U-13C6]glucose is 34%. The contributions of all other substrates to total glycerol production were determined similarly and normalized to 100%. The 13C NMR spectra of extracts of the aqueous layer obtained after hydrolysis of liver fats show well resolved resonances from glycerol (Fig. 4). The 13C enrichment in the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols was estimated using two approaches by analysis of the multiplet areas of the C1 and C3 glycerol resonance at 63.5 ppm and the C2 resonance at 73.0 ppm (Fig. 4). Given the low probability of forming either singly enriched [1-13C1]glycerol or [3-13C1]glycerol from any of these substrates, it was assumed that the singlet component corresponds to natural abundance levels of 13C (1.1%) and that the doublet component reflects a combination of [U-13C3]glycerol, [1,2-13C2]glycerol, and [2,3-13C2]glycerol isotopomers derived from the labeled substrate provided in each experiment. With this assumption, the area of the doublet component, normalized to 1.1% 13C in the singlet component, was 2.30 ± 0.19% in fed rats provided [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate, 1.74 ± 0.34% in fed rats given glucose/[U-13C3]glycerol/lactate, and 0.17 ± 0.03% in fed rats given glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate (Fig. 4A, left bar). The 13C enrichment in the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols did not differ significantly in rats supplied with [U-13C6]glucose versus [U-13C3]glycerol (p = 0.17) but was significantly higher compared with rats supplied with [U-13C3]lactate. A similar result was found in fed animals when the enrichment was estimated based on the glycerol C2 resonance with the assumption of 1.1% 13C in the singlet component (Fig. 4A, right bar). Unlike in the C1 and C3 resonance, the singlet in C2 is not well resolved because of overlap with the central peak of the C2 triplet. Nevertheless, the area of the singlet can be estimated by subtracting the triplet contribution, assuming a 1:2:1 area ratio for the three components of the triplet. Using the area of the C2 singlet in the calculation instead of the C1 and C3 singlet, the contribution of each substrate to the glycerol moiety was slightly higher: 2.30 → 2.94% in rats given [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate, 1.74 → 1.87% in rats given glucose/[U-13C3]glycerol/lactate, and 0.17 → 0.23% in rats given glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate (Fig. 4A, left graph versus right graph). Unlike the multiplets contributing to the C1 and C3 resonance, which do not distinguish between the direct versus indirect pathway, the C2 resonance is more informative (Fig. 5). Here, the triplet component largely reflects direct formation of acylglycerol-[U-13C3]glycerol from either [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C3]glycerol, whereas the doublet component can reflect only the indirect formation of the glycerol moiety after passage of the labeled substrate through the citric acid cycle. The results reported from the glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate experiment in fed animals (Fig. 4) showed 64% doublet and 36% triplet in the glycerol C2 resonance. This demonstrates that a small amount of the triplet component also arose from metabolism in the citric acid cycle. This amount was considered in the calculation of the direct versus indirect contribution of [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C3]glycerol as described above. Given this correction, 35 ± 4% of the [U-13C6]glucose carbons passed through the citric acid cycle prior to formation of the glycerol moiety. Similarly, of the glycerol moiety derived from exogenous [U-13C3]glycerol, 17 ± 1% passed through the citric acid cycle in fed animals (Fig. 5A). In fasted animals, enrichments in glycerol from hepatic acylglycerols based on C1 and C3 resonance analysis were 1.63 ± 0.21% in rats given [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate, 3.19 ± 0.50% in rats given glucose/[U-13C3]glycerol/lactate, and 0.84 ± 0.08% in rats given glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate (Fig. 4B, left bar). The enrichment from [U-13C3]glycerol was higher compared with the contribution from either [U-13C6]glucose or [U-13C3]lactate. A similar trend was found in glycerol C2 resonance analysis, except again higher enrichments compared with the data based on the C1 and C3 resonance analysis: 1.63 → 2.62% in rats given [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate, 3.19 → 3.81% in rats given glucose/[U-13C3]glycerol/lactate, and 0.84 → 1.31% in rats given glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate (Fig. 4B, right bar). As noted above, the percentages of doubly labeled and uniformly labeled acylglycerols from fasted rats provided glucose/glycerol/[U-13C3]lactate were 64 and 36%, respectively. Given the correction using this ratio, the multiplet data of the glycerol C2 resonances derived from fasted animals show that 71 ± 4% of all glucose carbons contributing to the glycerol moiety first passed through the citric acid cycle, whereas 24 ± 1% of all labeled glycerol contributing to the glycerol moiety first passed through the cycle (Fig. 5B). In either fed or fasted animals given a mixture of glucose, glycerol, and lactate, the majority of glycerol in hepatic acylglycerols was derived from glucose and free glycerol. Significant portions of glucose and glycerol contributions occurred after entry into the citric acid cycle, and this fraction was sensitive to the nutritional state. Fasting caused a 2-fold increase in the fraction of acylglycerols derived from glucose via the indirect pathway compared with the fed state. The contribution of lactate to the glycerol moiety was trivial in fed animals, and although it increased somewhat in fasted rats, lactate remained a minor contributor to the glycerol moiety in liver. Previous studies using the water tracer method to determine the sources of triglyceride-glycerol in liver have noted the possibility of overestimation of glyceroneogenesis as a consequence of metabolism of glucose to pyruvate, followed by synthesis to the glycerol moiety (6Chen J.L. Peacock E. Samady W. Turner S.M. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Murphy E.J. Physiologic and pharmacologic factors influencing glyceroneogenic contribution to triacylglyceride glycerol measured by mass isotopomer distribution analysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25396-25402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, Nye et al. (9Nye C.K. Hanson R.W. Kalhan S.C. Glyceroneogenesis is the dominant pathway for triglyceride glycerol synthesis in vivo in the rat.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27565-27574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) complemented the use of 3H2O with the addition of [U-14C6]glucose to allow correction for the contribution of glucose arising through the citric acid cycle. Triglyceride-glycerol labeled at C2 and C3 was considered in the calculation of cycled glucose. However, other labeling patterns in the glycerol moiety could also arise with passage of glucose carbons through the oxaloacetate pool. [U-14C3]Pyruvate in liver from glycolysis of [U-14C6]glucose also results in triglyceride-[U-14C3]glycerol and triglyceride-[1,2-14C2]glycerol through the metabolic network involved in the citric acid cycle. Furthermore, [2,3-14C2]G3P formed from [U-14C3]pyruvate is in exchange with glycerol, a symmetric molecule, which consequently can become [1,2-14C2]G3P and eventually triglyceride-[1,2-14C2]glycerol. The relative amounts of these isotopomers will be sensitive not only to the fraction of glucose carbons entering the cycle via pyruvate carboxylase but also the extent of “backward” scrambling into the symmetric four-carbon intermediates. In this study, we used [U-13C3]lactate to correct for these pathways, which allowed us to measure the fraction of glucose that passed through the citric acid cycle during glycerol moiety formation. With this correction, the total contribution of glucose to the glycerol moiety was found to be the major source among these three exogenous contributors in fed animals and also an important source in fasted animals, whereas the contribution of exogenous lactate was small in both fed and fasted animals. We have also shown that the contribution of exogenous glycerol to the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols was important in liver and that glucose was not the only substrate that passed through the cycle. The free glycerol contribution was similar to glucose in fed animals but was almost 2-fold greater than glucose in fasted animals. The contribution of glyceroneogenesis measured by the [U-13C3]lactate tracer increased in fasted animals, but still, it was the smallest contribution among the sources. Although the indirect contribution of free glycerol was less than that of glucose, it was comparable with the [U-13C3]lactate contribution under fed (1.87 × 0.17 = 0.32% versus 0.23%) and fasted (3.81 × 0.24 = 0.91% versus 1.31%) conditions. The extensive 13C labeling in the citric acid cycle intermediates or molecules in exchange with the intermediates confirmed the involvement of the citric acid cycle in the indirect contribution of glucose or free glycerol to the glycerol moiety. The indirect contribution observed in this study occurred presumably within the liver itself. However, one cannot exclude the possibility of peripheral metabolism of either glucose or glycerol to lactate, followed by glyceroneogenesis in liver. In the case of rats given glucose/[U-13C3]glycerol/lactate, the 13C enrichment found in blood glucose was only 3% in fed animals and 11% in fasted animals by measured summed enrichments of multiple-labeled glucose isotopomers, including [1,2-13C2]glucose, [2,3-13C2]glucose, [1,2,3-13C3]glucose, [4,5-13C2]glucose, [5,6-13C2]glucose, [4,5,6-13C3]glucose, and [U-13C6]glucose. In rats given [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate, the 13C enrichment found in blood glucose was 40% in fed animals and 60% in fasted animals. Thus, we further examined the possibility of peripheral lactate contribution to the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols in the livers of fasted rats given [U-13C6]glucose/glycerol/lactate, which had the highest 13C enrichments in blood glucose. Fig. 6 shows C2 resonances of lactate from liver, circulating blood, and skeletal muscle of a fasted rat given a mixture of [U-13C6]glucose, glycerol, and lactate along with the C2 resonance of the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols in liver. The fractions of doublets (produced after cycling) in the glycerol moiety and lactate in liver were much higher than those in either blood or skeletal muscle, indicating that the observed doubly labeled molecules in liver were produced primarily through metabolism in the liver itself. Previously, we observed that skeletal muscle did not produce doubly labeled three-carbon units from [U-13C3]lactate (12Jin E.S. Sherry A.D. Malloy C.R. Evidence for reverse flux through pyruvate kinase in skeletal muscle.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 296: E748-E757Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although [U-13C3]lactate in liver could be derived from either glycolysis in liver or peripheral metabolism, the combination of isotopomers found in glycerol isolated from liver acylglycerols was most consistent with involvement of the citric acid cycle in liver. 13C enrichment in the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols was measured by assuming that the singlet of glycerol C1 and C3 or the singlet of C2 arose from natural abundance 13C. Administration of exogenous 13C-labeled substrates could produce excess singlet, which would cause underestimation of the actual enrichments. In this study, the singlet of glycerol C1 and C3 could arise from exogenous 13C-labeled substrates, whereas the singlet of C2 was essentially only natural abundance 13C in the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols (Fig. 2). This explains why the enrichment based on the C1 and C3 resonance analysis was consistently lower compared with the enrichment based on the C2 resonance analysis (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, compared with the C2 resonance of the glycerol moiety, the simpler multiplet pattern in the C1 and C3 resonance makes it easy to appreciate the degree of enrichments because the singlet reflects mostly natural abundance 13C, whereas doublets represent signals from all of the multiply labeled glycerol isotopomers (i.e. [1,2-13C2]glycerol, [2,3-13C2]glycerol, and [U-13C3]glycerol), which cannot arise from natural abundance. In summary, glucose and glycerol are major contributors to the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols in the livers of both fed rats and fasted rats given a mixture of exogenous glucose, glycerol, and lactate. However, significant fractions of both glucose and glycerol contributions occurred by synthesis of the glycerol moiety after metabolism in the citric acid cycle. Interestingly, the indirect contribution of glucose was >2-fold greater than the direct contribution in fasted rats. In addition, exogenous glycerol also contributed significantly to the glycerol moiety through the citric acid cycle. 13C NMR analysis with 13C-labeled substrates is a powerful tool for the study of sources of the glycerol moiety, distinguishing direct and indirect contributions of glucose and glycerol to the glycerol backbone of acylglycerols in liver. This approach is readily applicable in a clinical setting where acylglycerols (transported by VLDL) released from the liver can be sampled from blood.

https://openalex.org/W2044676446,"Membrane traffic requires the specific concentration of protein cargos and exclusion of other proteins into nascent carriers. Critical components of this selectivity are the protein adaptors that bind to short, linear motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane protein cargos and sequester them into nascent carriers. The recruitment of the adaptors is mediated by activated Arf GTPases, and the Arf-adaptor complexes mark sites of carrier formation. However, the nature of the signal(s) that initiates carrier biogenesis remains unknown. We examined the specificity and initial sites of recruitment of Arf-dependent adaptors (AP-1 and GGAs) in response to the Golgi or endosomal localization of specific cargo proteins (furin, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR), and M6PR lacking a C-terminal domain M6PRΔC). We find that cargo promotes the recruitment of specific adaptors, suggesting that it is part of an upstream signaling event. Cargos do not promote adaptor recruitment to all compartments in which they reside, and thus additional factors regulate the cargo's ability to promote Arf activation and adaptor recruitment. We document that within a given compartment different cargos recruit different adaptors, suggesting that there is little or no free, activated Arf at the membrane and that Arf activation is spatially and temporally coupled to the cargo and the adaptor. Using temperature block, brefeldin A, and recovery from each, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of M6PR causes the recruitment of AP-1 and GGAs to recycling endosomes and not at the Golgi, as predicted by steady state staining profiles. These results are discussed with respect to the generation of novel models for cargo-dependent regulation of membrane traffic."

There are only three museum specimens from the late 19th century known. The species has been never found again, despite intensive searches on Mahé. Therefore, P. seychellensis has been declared as “Extinct” by the IUCN and is the sole putatively extinct freshwater turtle species. Using DNA sequences of three mitochondrial genes of the historical type specimen and phylogenetic analyses including all other species of the genus, we provide evidence that the description of P. seychellensis was erroneously based on a widely distributed West African species, P. castaneus. Consequently, we synonymize the two species and delete P. seychellensis from the list of extinct chelonian species and from the faunal list of the Seychelles."
https://openalex.org/W1979139053,"Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in which the cytoplasm of a cell is divided into two daughter cells after the segregation of genetic material, and the central spindle and midbody are considered to be the essential structures required for the initiation and completion of cytokinesis. Here, we determined that the centrosome protein Cep57, which is localized to the central spindle and midbody, acts as a spindle organizer and is required for cytokinesis. Depletion of Cep57 disrupted microtubule assembly of the central spindle and further led to abnormal midbody localization of MKLP1, Plk1, and Aurora B, which resulted in cytokinesis failure and the formation of binuclear cells. Furthermore, we found that Cep57 directly recruited Tektin 1 to the midbody matrix to regulate microtubule organization. Thus, our data reveal that Cep57 is essential for cytokinesis via regulation of central spindle assembly and formation of the midbody."

Significance: Detailing the mechanism of spontaneous transnitrosation is crucial to understanding how protein S-nitrosation is controlled. S-Nitrosation is a post-translational modification resulting from the covalent linkage of nitric oxide (NO) to cysteine thiols. The experimentally verified S-nitrosoproteome is rapidly increasing (1Lee T.-Y. Chen Y.-J. Lu C.-T. Ching W.-C. Teng Y.-C. Huang H.-D. Chen Y.-J. dbSNO.

Unsurprisingly, dysregulation of protein S-nitrosation has been associated with several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, various cancers, and diabetes (reviewed in Ref. 6Foster M.W.

S-Nitrosothiols are formed either by the direct, diffusion controlled reaction between the thiyl radical and NO (7Madej E. Folkes L.K. Wardman P. Czapski G. Goldstein S.

Cadenas E. Han D. Determination of GSH, GSSG, and GSNO using HPLC with electrochemical detection.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 473: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) means that S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) 2The abbreviations used are: GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; CysNO, S-nitrosocysteine; α2, helix 2 of glutathione transferase P1-1; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. is the major S-nitrosothiol in vivo (11Gaston B.

U.S.A. 1993; 90: 10957-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and therefore spontaneous transnitrosation of protein thiols by GSNO is a significant route for protein S-nitrosation. In support of this, cellular GSNO appears to be in equilibrium with protein-SNOs, with an increase in GSNO levels leading to increased protein S-nitrosation (12Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. A metabolic enzyme for S-nitrosothiol conserved from bacteria to humans.Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In addition, GSNO treatment causes widespread S-nitrosation of yeast proteins (13Foster M.W. Forrester M.T. Stamler J.S. A protein microarray-based analysis of S-nitrosylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18948-18953Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and GSNO is commonly used to stimulate S-nitrosation of purified protein in vitro.

Because protein S-nitrosation is largely not under enzymatic control, elucidating possible mechanisms of spontaneous GSNO-mediated transnitrosation is crucial to understanding how S-nitrosation is controlled, as well as targeted to specific cysteines. Human glutathione transferase P1-1 is a well characterized detoxification enzyme that also functions to regulate cell proliferation by inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (18Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y.

Equilibrium titrations were performed by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 2 μm S-nitrosated protein prepared as described above but with varying concentrations of GSNO or CysNO. The fluorescence intensities showed a hyperbolic dependence on reagent concentration, with the exception of the reaction between GSNO and C47S GSTP1-1, which fit better to a Hill equation with n = −0.5. Kinetics of GSTP1-1 nitrosation or denitrosation were measured by following the change in intrinsic protein fluorescence using an SX-18MV stopped-flow instrument (Applied Photophysics). Excitation was at 280 nm and emission light was collected using a 320-nm long-pass filter. Final protein concentrations were 1 μm and all experiments were performed in 20 mm phosphate buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. At least three traces were recorded and averaged at each ligand concentration. α2 unfolding rates were measured under the same conditions by following the initial increase in protein fluorescence following mixing with 7.5 m urea (27Gildenhuys S.

Fluorescence transients for C101S or C47S GSTP1-1 nitrosation were fit to a double-exponential function using SigmaPlot version 11.0 or the stopped-flow instrument software. The second exponent was fixed to the kobs value from a single-exponential fit of the fluorescence transient for the reaction of C47S/C101S GSTP1-1 with GSNO. In this way, the kinetics data of the single mutants were corrected for the slow, substoichiometric S-nitrosation at the third site. The first exponent from the fits is subsequently reported here as the kobs for Cys47 nitrosation (C101S mutant) or Cys101 nitrosation (C47S mutant). The quality of the fits was judged by inspection of the residuals.

Here, we generated a series of cysteine mutants with the aim of examining the kinetics of nitrosation of GSTP1-1 in detail. Reaction of wild-type GSTP1-1 with GSNO or CysNO resulted in S-nitrosated protein with a stoichiometry of 2 ± 0.1 S-nitrosothiols per subunit, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, mutation of either Cys47 or Cys101 to serine reduced the number of S-nitrosocysteines to 1.2 ± 0.1 per subunit. Surprisingly, we also detected a substoichiometric (0.3 ± 0.1/subunit) S-nitrosation of C47S/C101S double mutant GSTP1-1. The identity of the third S-nitrosation site (or sites) is unclear, but may represent S-nitrosation at another cysteine, or even nitration of tryptophan or tyrosine residues (29Nuriel T. Hansler A.

This alternate nitrosation event is unlikely to be physiologically interesting because it has not been detected in vivo, affects only a minor subpopulation of protein and occurs with very slow kinetics (Figs. 1C and 2B). We therefore corrected all kinetics data for S-nitrosation at the alternate site, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this way, only S-nitrosation at Cys47 (C101S mutant) or Cys101 (C47S mutant) were studied.FIGURE 2Kinetics of GSTP1-1 nitrosation monitored by intrinsic fluorescence. A, representative transients showing the decrease in fluorescence when 1 μm of different cysteine mutants of GSTP1-1 was mixed with 500 μm nitrosating agent (GSNO or CysNO) at 37 °C. Curves were normalized to have the same starting fluorescence. B, S-nitrosation of 1 μm wild-type GSTP1-1 with 500 μm GSNO. The data were fit to a triple-exponential function. The residuals show an excellent fit to the data when the three exponential terms are fixed to the observed rate constants for nitrosation at Cys47, Cys101, and the alternate site, respectively, determined from fitting the data in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cys101, and Cys47 especially, are located close to the two tryptophan residues (Trp28 and Trp38) in domain 1 of GSTP1-1 (Fig. 1A). These residues provide a convenient probe of S-nitrosation, as the modification results in significant quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence, probably due to FRET between the indole ring and S-NO moiety (30Chen X. Wen Z. Xian M. Wang K. Ramachandran N. Tang X. Schlegel H.B. Mutus B. Wang P.G. Fluorophore-labeled S-nitrosothiols.J. Org. Chem. 2001; 66: 6064-6073Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Equilibrium fluorescence titrations of wild-type and mutant GSTP1-1 reveal that both Cys47 and Cys101 are S-nitrosated with relatively low affinity (low micromolar KD values) by either GSNO or CysNO (Fig. 1C and Table 1). The equilibrium titration of Cys101 with GSNO shows some evidence of negative cooperativity, with the data better described by a Hill equation with n = −0.5. This is discussed below with reference to Fig. 6. Consistent with the kinetics data in Fig. 2B, the alternate nitrosation site (C47S/C101S mutant) has a KD 10-fold higher than either of the canonical sites.TABLE 1Kinetic and equilibrium constants for S-nitrosation of GSTP1-1 according to Scheme 1LigandNitrosation sitekopenα2k+NOk−NOk−NOGSHKDs−1m−1 s−1s−1m−1 s−1μmGSNOCys470.022 ± 0.001NDND, not determined.0.0008 ± 0.000146 ± 310 ± 0.5Cys101NA40 ± 3Estimated from fit to linear portion of curve.0.001 ± 0.00021.4 ± 0.064 ± 4CysNOCys470.07 ± 0.02ND0.0008 ± 0.0001NANA, not applicable.8 ± 0.6Cys101NA100 ± 50.001 ± 0.0002NA15 ± 2a ND, not determined.b Estimated from fit to linear portion of curve.c NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon S-nitrosation of GSTP1-1 was used to probe the kinetics of the modification at Cys47 and Cys101. Representative transients from mixing 500 μm nitrosating agent with 1 μm protein reveal distinct differences between the rates and amplitudes of nitrosation at Cys47 and Cys101 (Fig. 2B). S-Nitrosation at Cys47 occurs more rapidly and produces a larger fluorescence change than at Cys101, whereas changing the nitrosation agent to CysNO results in even faster reaction kinetics. To demonstrate that the kinetics of nitrosation of the Cys-mutant GSTP1-1 reliably reports on the reactions of the wild-type protein, the fluorescence transient for wild-type GSTP1-1 mixed with GSNO was fit to a triple-exponential function (Fig. 2C). By fixing the three observed rate constants to the kobs calculated from fits to the C101S, C47S, and C47S/C101S nitrosation transients, respectively, an excellent fit was obtained for the wild-type data. This demonstrates that GSTP1-1 S-nitrosation kinetics at different sites can be reliably partitioned by cysteine mutagenesis. To characterize the kinetics of Cys47 nitrosation, the concentration dependence of the observed rates at 37 °C were evaluated for both GSNO and CysNO under pseudo-first order conditions (Fig. 3). For both nitrosating agents, the plots appeared hyperbolic, indicating that more than one event contributes to Cys47 S-nitrosation kinetics. Assuming the simplest case (a two-step mechanism), two common scenarios are consistent with these data: 1) low affinity S-nitrosation of Cys47 followed by a slow conformational change (induced-fit, rapid equilibrium assumption); or 2) a slow equilibrium between protein conformers, followed by the chemical S-nitrosation event (conformational selection) (31Vogt A.D. Di Cera E. Conformational selection or induced-fit? A critical appraisal of the kinetic mechanism.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 5894-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). If the induced fit model is correct, then the data should correspond to an increasing hyperbolic function, whatever the relative magnitudes of the rate constants for the first and second steps. A conformational selection mechanism, however, will produce an inverted hyperbolic dependence on ligand concentration if the forward rate constant for the first step becomes smaller than the reverse rate constant for the second step. We therefore sought to discriminate between these two scenarios by following the reaction between GSNO and Cys47 of GSTP1-1 at different temperatures, potentially altering the relative magnitudes of the conformational and chemical steps. Fig. 4A clearly demonstrates that at 15 °C the concentration dependence of Cys47 nitrosation inverts to give a decreasing hyperbolic function. This is strong evidence that the formation of S-nitrosated GSTP1-1 is limited by a pre-equilibrium between protein conformers. With reference to Scheme 1, lowering the temperature to 15 °C causes kopen to become smaller than k−NOCys-47, giving the plot in Fig. 4A. Above 20 °C, kopen is larger than k−NOCys-47, resulting in an increasing hyperbolic function. The data at all temperatures were therefore fit to Equation 2, derived from Scheme 1. Because the two steps are not independently resolved in the fluorescence transients, only kopen (the saturation value) and k−NOCys-47 (the y intercept) can be resolved from these data. Deriving k−NOCys-47 from the plot in Fig. 3 is error-prone because the y intercept is close to 0, so this value was instead determined in an independent experiment (Fig. 7). Kinetic constants for S-nitrosation of Cys47 at 37 °C are reported in Table 1.FIGURE 4Temperature dependence of Cys47 S-nitrosation suggests that a conformational equilibrium limits the chemical step. A, the experiment described in the legend to Fig. 3 was repeated at different temperatures, with varying [GSNO] and 1 μm C101S GSTP1-1. The solid lines are fits to Equation 4. Values of kopen from the fits were analyzed with an Eyring plot (B), yielding ΔH = 114 ± 23 kJ mol−1 and TΔS = 26 ± 23 kJ mol−1. C, the energetics of α2 unfolding were determined independently in an Eyring plot of the temperature dependence of the rate of unfolding of α2 (kU) in 7.5 m urea, yielding ΔH = 118 ± 3 kJ mol−1 and TΔS = 50 ± 3 kJ mol−1. D, domain 1 of GSTP1-1. When α2 is closed, the thiol of Cys47 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket (blue surface) at the active site. S-Nitrosation at Cys47 requires α2 to be in its open conformation, and is therefore limited by the equilibrium between the open and closed states (kclosed/kopen).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure V"

CycT1 binds to cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and forms the positive transcription elongation factor-b (P-TEFb). P-TEFb is then recruited by HIV-1 TAT to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and subsequently leads to phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (pol II), enhanced processivity of pol II, and transcription of a full-length HIV-1 RNA. In this study, we report the identification of a new CYCT1 splice variant, designated as CYCT1b, and accordingly we renamed CYCT1 as CYCT1a. CYCT1b was detected in several cell lines, including primary human CD4 T cells, and its expression was subject to cell cycle regulation. Similar to CYCT1a, CYCT1b was primarily localized in the nucleus. CYCT1b expression was found to be inversely correlated with HIV-1 gene expression and replication. This inverse correlation appeared to involve TAT transactivation, CDK9 binding, and subsequent recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 LTR promoter and pol II C-terminal domain phosphorylation. In agreement with these findings, CYCT1b expression led to direct inhibition of TAT-transactivated transcription of the HIV-1 LTR promoter. Taken together, these results show that the newly identified CYCT1b splice variant inhibits HIV-1 transcription and may provide new clues for the development of anti-HIV strategies.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Currently, there are an estimated 33.3 million people around the world under the threat of this virus, according to the annual reports from the World Health Organization. Currently, there is no practical vaccine available for HIV-1, and treatment of its infection is primarily based on antiretroviral drugs that include nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, fusion or entry inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. These drugs are designed to interfere with multiple steps during the HIV-1 life cycle by targeting the viral components of HIV-1. Alternatively, in the past 20 years a large number of host cellular factors were discovered to be involved in the regulation of its life cycle, thereby becoming potential targets for HIV-1 therapeutics. Subsequently, interactions between host cellular factors and viral proteins or DNA/RNA elements have recently been considered progressively more important in the regulation of HIV-1 replication. In latent HIV-1 infection, the genomic RNA is reverse-transcribed and integrated into the host genome.

However, this viral RNA is distinguishable from host RNA due to the presence of introns and other cis-elements, leading to occasional specific regulation by host factors. During the activation of HIV-1 transcription from the genome, several transcription factors are recruited to the LTR promoter to initiate basic transcription, including NFκB, often considered the most important factor (1Rohr O.

Following sufficient induction of protein expression, TAT binds to the TAR RNA and recruits P-TEFb to stimulate viral transcription (3Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

HIV-1 RNA is alternatively spliced into three groups as follows: 2 kb of fully spliced mRNAs, 4 kb of incompletely spliced mRNAs, and 9 kb of unspliced genomic RNA (4Purcell D.F. Martin M.A. Alternative splicing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mRNA modulates viral protein expression, replication, and infectivity.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6365-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular splicing factors, including SR proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family members, are involved in this process and play alternative roles in the splicing of HIV-1 RNA (5Jablonski J.A.

Virol. 2009; 83: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Exports of unspliced or incompletely spliced mRNAs are usually blocked by cellular factors encoded by eukaryotic cells. The HIV-1 REV protein may recognize the REV response element on these “immature” mRNAs, allowing them to be exported to the cytoplasm through the CRM-1 pathway (6Bogerd H.P. Echarri A. Ross T.M.

Currently, three cyclin T isoforms (CYCT1, CYCT2a, and CYCT2b) have been identified to be associated with CDK9 to constitute the P-TEFb complex (16Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H.

CYCT1 is an approximate 86-kDa protein, found in 80% of human P-TEFb heterodimers, and is the only cyclin that can bind to TAT to support HIV-1 transcription (3Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M.

It was revealed by microarray analysis that there was limited redundancy in the genes regulated by either CYCT1 or CYCT2 (44Ramakrishnan R. Yu W. Rice A.P.

The human CYCT1 gene has been mapped to human chromosome 12, with four transcripts of different sizes detected by Northern blot analysis, indicating that CYCT1 mRNA may be alternatively transcribed or spliced (3Wei P.

However, there are no data yet available on the alternative splicing product of CYCT1 or the post-transcriptional regulation of CYCT1 variants. In this study, we identified a novel transcript of CYCT1, which we named CYCT1b. This novel transcript is an antagonist of CYCT1a (formerly CYCT1), resulting in inhibition of TAT-mediated LTR transactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that CYCT1b competes with CYCT1a for binding to CDK9, thereby interfering with the hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, resulting in the suppression of transcriptional elongation. 293T, HeLa, and Jurkat cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin (CellGro, Manassas, VA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the same supplements 6 h post-transfection and the cells were harvested for the following: protein analysis by Western blot or immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot; analysis of luciferase reporter gene activity; or isolation of total RNA and RNA analysis by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). In all transfections, pcDNA3 was used to equalize the amount of total transfected DNA. Plasmids pNL4-3, pLTR.luc, pMyc.Tat, HIVdGless have been described elsewhere (46Liu Y. Jones M. Hingtgen C.M.

GFP-CYCT1b-expressing lentiviruses were packaged in 293T cells by co-transfection with pLL.GFP-CycT1b (4 μg)/pLentilox3.7 (4 μg) and pLP1 (2 μg), pLP2 (2 μg), and pVSV-G (2 μg) helper plasmids. Forty eight hours post-medium change, cell culture supernatants were collected, filtered, and saved as lentivirus stock. GFP-expressing lentiviruses were similarly prepared using pLL.GFP plasmid. HIV-1 NL4-3 viruses were prepared in 293T cells as described previously (48He J. Chen Y. Farzan M. Choe H. Ohagen A. Gartner S. Busciglio J. Yang X. Hofmann W. Newman W. Mackay C.R. Sodroski J.

Viruses were titered by infecting 293T or Ghost.CXCR4 cell lines. Jurkat cells were first transduced with lentiviruses (m.o.i. = 0.5) for 30 h and then infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 virus (m.o.i. = 1). The cultures were cultured for 7 more days and then harvested for cell lysates and Western blotting. Cell culture supernatants were collected for p24 ELISA. All transductions and infections were performed in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Total RNA was extracted from 293T cells or HeLa cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.

https://openalex.org/W2038154718,"Objective The study aims to evaluate the predictors of non-prescription medicine purchasing patterns among pharmacy patrons in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional nationwide study was undertaken in 2011 in sixty randomly selected community pharmacies across 14 Malaysian states. A pharmacy exit survey was conducted over a 6-month period across Malaysia. A one-stage random cluster sampling technique was employed as there was no national sampling framework available for conducting this survey. Face-to-face interviews using a validated and pre-tested questionnaire were conducted by trained data collectors. The non-prescription medicine purchasing pattern was explored and analysed descriptively. Chi-square/Fisher exact test was used to determine the association between study variables. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of type of non-prescription medicine purchased. Results A total of 2729 pharmacy patrons agreed to participate in 60 selected pharmacy outlets. A total of 3462 non-prescription medicine were purchased during the study period with an average of 1.3 medicines per participant. Most of the non-prescription medicine purchased was meant for alimentary tract and metabolism (31.8%), followed by respiratory system (19.4%) and musculoskeletal system (15.8%) usage. Factors found to be associated with the choice of non-prescription medicine purchased were age group [χ2 = 170.75, (df = 57), p<0.01], locality [χ2 = 48.16, (df = 19), p<0.01], gender [χ2 = 32.93, (df = 13), p = 0.002], ethnic group [χ2 = 118.89, (df = 39), p<0.01] and type of occupation [χ2 = 222.434, (df = 117), p<0.01]. Non-prescription medicine purchased defined about 20% of the variance in the combination of predictors such as locality, gender, age, ethnicity, type of occupation and household income. Conclusion The predictors for selection of non-prescription medicine were locality (urban or rural), gender, age, ethnicity, type of occupation and household income per month. Future studies need to explore the safety and effectiveness of using these non-prescription medicines."
https://openalex.org/W3125413527,"Many recently developed nonparametric jump tests can be viewed as multiple hypothesis testing problems. For such multiple hypothesis tests, it is well known that controlling type I error often makes a large proportion of erroneous rejections, and such situation becomes even worse when the jump occurrence is a rare event. To obtain more reliable results, we aim to control the false discovery rate (FDR), an efficient compound error measure for erroneous rejections in multiple testing problems. We perform the test via the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (BNS) test statistic, and control the FDR with the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure. We provide asymptotic results for the FDR control. From simulations, we examine relevant theoretical results and demonstrate the advantages of controlling the FDR. The hybrid approach is then applied to empirical analysis on two benchmark stock indices with high frequency data."
