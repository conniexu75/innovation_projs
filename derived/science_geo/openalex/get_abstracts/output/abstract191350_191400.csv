https://openalex.org/W1983003080,THE study of diffuse scattering of X-rays at low angles has been used for evaluating the size of crystallites and of particles1. We have applied this technique to bone tissue in order to study the arrangement of hydroxylapatite crystallites in this structure.

Fears were expressed that this disease might eventually reach East Africa. Plans were accordingly made for authorities in West Africa to test East African varieties of maize for susceptibility to the fungus, and for the introduction of maize varieties from Central America in the hope that resistant types might be found in an area where the disease is endemic."

It is not unusual iIIS^^KW for the modern American scientist to find himself making demands on g&?§J£Q society that would formerly have been thought unnecessary to make for financial support, for freedom from interference, for understanding of scientific aspirations and techniques on the part of the public. In protecting his own selfinterest as a scientist he is compelled to enter arenas of value judgment from which science, as a philosophy, has progressively withdrawn itself. The principles on which claims might be based are no longer, if they ever were, generally accepted ; and on every hand are signs of antiscientific sentiment. Deprived of the protective devices that operate within the scientific fold, the scientist is confronted with the problem of how to conduct himself in the fields of nonscientific behavior, of which poetry and politics, one for individuals and the other for society as a whole, are two extremes."

https://openalex.org/W1995635614,"THE action of diazomethane on proteins has been studied by a number of workers, who report that both O- and N-methylation occur. There is apparently no fission of the peptide chains, although it is stated1 that the action of diazomethane on insulin causes a decrease in the cystine content. On the other hand, Kirst2 claims that the cystine bridges in wool are unaffected by the reagent, and Herzig and Landsteiner3 state that wool is rather more resistant to diazomethane than are other proteins. In most of this earlier work, it was specifically stated that dry proteins and dry ethereal solutions of diazomethane were used. Recently, Kuhn and Ruelius4 have shown that diazomethane acts on aqueous solutions of peptides with formation of the corresponding betaines, while serum albumin and ovalbumin in water are slowly converted to insoluble products. We have now found that wool can be extensively degraded by ethereal diazomethane solutions, the product being almost completely soluble in water. The diazomethane, prepared from nitrosomethylurea, is added to the wool over a period of several days, together with small quantities of water. The soluble product contains no sulphur, and diffuses through ‘Cellophane’, while the appearance of the wool during the reaction closely resembles that of wool treated with strong alkali."

The book was commissioned by a British publisher, Allan Wingate, and was first published in England, but the author is an American."
