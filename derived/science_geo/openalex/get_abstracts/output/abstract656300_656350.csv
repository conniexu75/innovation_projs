https://openalex.org/W3042305844,"Comprehensive, high-quality reference genomes are required for functional characterization and taxonomic assignment of the human gut microbiota. We present the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, comprising 204,938 nonredundant genomes from 4,644 gut prokaryotes. These genomes encode >170 million protein sequences, which we collated in the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalog. The UHGP more than doubles the number of gut proteins in comparison to those present in the Integrated Gene Catalog. More than 70% of the UHGG species lack cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP lack functional annotations. Intraspecies genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which are specific to individual human populations. The UHGG and UHGP collections will enable studies linking genotypes to phenotypes in the human gut microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W3043143974,"CRISPR-guided DNA cytosine and adenine base editors are widely used for many applications1–4 but primarily create DNA base transitions (that is, pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine or purine-to-purine). Here we describe the engineering of two base editor architectures that can efficiently induce targeted C-to-G base transversions, with reduced levels of unwanted C-to-W (W = A or T) and indel mutations. One of these C-to-G base editors (CGBE1), consists of an RNA-guided Cas9 nickase, an Escherichia coli–derived uracil DNA N-glycosylase (eUNG) and a rat APOBEC1 cytidine deaminase variant (R33A) previously shown to have reduced off-target RNA and DNA editing activities5,6. We show that CGBE1 can efficiently induce C-to-G edits, particularly in AT-rich sequence contexts in human cells. We also removed the eUNG domain to yield miniCGBE1, which reduced indel frequencies but only modestly decreased editing efficiency. CGBE1 and miniCGBE1 enable C-to-G edits and will serve as a basis for optimizing C-to-G base editors for research and therapeutic applications. A new base editor enables the creation of C-to-G base changes in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W3043719325,"Current base editors (BEs) catalyze only base transitions (C to T and A to G) and cannot produce base transversions. Here we present BEs that cause C-to-A transversions in Escherichia coli and C-to-G transversions in mammalian cells. These glycosylase base editors (GBEs) consist of a Cas9 nickase, a cytidine deaminase and a uracil-DNA glycosylase (Ung). Ung excises the U base created by the deaminase, forming an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that initiates the DNA repair process. In E. coli, we used activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to construct AID-nCas9-Ung and found that it converts C to A with an average editing specificity of 93.8% ± 4.8% and editing efficiency of 87.2% ± 6.9%. For use in mammalian cells, we replaced AID with rat APOBEC1 (APOBEC-nCas9-Ung). We tested APOBEC-nCas9-Ung at 30 endogenous sites, and we observed C-to-G conversions with a high editing specificity at the sixth position of the protospacer between 29.7% and 92.2% and an editing efficiency between 5.3% and 53.0%. APOBEC-nCas9-Ung supplements the current adenine and cytidine BEs (ABE and CBE, respectively) and could be used to target G/C disease-causing mutations. New base editors change C to A in bacteria and C to G in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W3043694186,"Epigenetic processes govern prostate cancer (PCa) biology, as evidenced by the dependency of PCa cells on the androgen receptor (AR), a prostate master transcription factor. We generated 268 epigenomic datasets spanning two state transitions-from normal prostate epithelium to localized PCa to metastases-in specimens derived from human tissue. We discovered that reprogrammed AR sites in metastatic PCa are not created de novo; rather, they are prepopulated by the transcription factors FOXA1 and HOXB13 in normal prostate epithelium. Reprogrammed regulatory elements commissioned in metastatic disease hijack latent developmental programs, accessing sites that are implicated in prostate organogenesis. Analysis of reactivated regulatory elements enabled the identification and functional validation of previously unknown metastasis-specific enhancers at HOXB13, FOXA1 and NKX3-1. Finally, we observed that prostate lineage-specific regulatory elements were strongly associated with PCa risk heritability and somatic mutation density. Examining prostate biology through an epigenomic lens is fundamental for understanding the mechanisms underlying tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W3033978236,"This paper seeks to understand whether a catastrophic and urgent event, such as the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerates or reverses trends in international collaboration, especially in and between China and the United States. A review of research articles produced in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic shows that COVID-19 research had smaller teams and involved fewer nations than pre-COVID-19 coronavirus research. The United States and China were, and continue to be in the pandemic era, at the center of the global network in coronavirus related research, while developing countries are relatively absent from early research activities in the COVID-19 period. Not only are China and the United States at the center of the global network of coronavirus research, but they strengthen their bilateral research relationship during COVID-19, producing more than 4.9% of all global articles together, in contrast to 3.6% before the pandemic. In addition, in the COVID-19 period, joined by the United Kingdom, China and the United States continued their roles as the largest contributors to, and home to the main funders of, coronavirus related research. These findings suggest that the global COVID-19 pandemic shifted the geographic loci of coronavirus research, as well as the structure of scientific teams, narrowing team membership and favoring elite structures. These findings raise further questions over the decisions that scientists face in the formation of teams to maximize a speed, skill trade-off. Policy implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3045291091,"COVID-19 pneumonia typically begins with subpleural ground glass opacities with progressive extension on computerized tomography studies. Lung ultrasound is well suited to this interstitial, subpleural involvement, and it is now broadly used in intensive care units (ICUs). The extension and severity of lung infiltrates can be described numerically with a reproducible and validated lung ultrasound score (LUSS). We hypothesized that LUSS might be useful as a tool to non-invasively monitor the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia at the bedside. LUSS monitoring was rapidly implemented in the management of our COVID-19 patients with RT-PCR-documented COVID-19. The LUSS was evaluated repeatedly at the bedside. We present a graphic description of the course of LUSS during COVID-19 in 10 consecutive patients admitted in our intensive care unit with moderate to severe ARDS between March 15 and 30th. LUSS appeared to be closely related to the disease progression. In successfully extubated patients, LUSS decreased and was lower than at the time of intubation. LUSS increased inexorably in a patient who died from refractory hypoxemia. LUSS helped with the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), showing an increased score and the presence of new lung consolidations in all 5 patients with VAPs. There was also a good agreement between CT-scans and LUSS as for the presence of lung consolidations. In conclusion, our early experience suggests that LUSS monitoring accurately reflect disease progression and indicates potential usefulness for the management of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. It might help with early VAP diagnosis, mechanical ventilation weaning management, and potentially reduce the need for X-ray and CT exams. LUSS evaluation is easy to use and readily available in ICUs throughout the world, and might be a safe, cheap and simple tool to optimize critically ill COVID-19 patients care during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3043429322,"Activation of the IRE1/XBP1s signaling arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a promising strategy to correct defects in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis implicated in diverse diseases. However, no pharmacologic activators of this pathway identified to date are suitable for ER proteostasis remodeling through selective activation of IRE1/XBP1s signaling. Here, we use high-throughput screening to identify non-toxic compounds that induce ER proteostasis remodeling through IRE1/XBP1s activation. We employ transcriptional profiling to stringently confirm that our prioritized compounds selectively activate IRE1/XBP1s signaling without activating other cellular stress-responsive signaling pathways. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our compounds improve ER proteostasis of destabilized variants of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through an IRE1-dependent mechanism and reduce APP-associated mitochondrial toxicity in cellular models. These results establish highly selective IRE1/XBP1s activating compounds that can be widely employed to define the functional importance of IRE1/XBP1s activity for ER proteostasis regulation in the context of health and disease. Highly selective activators of IRE1/XBP1 splicing pathway were identified via high-throughput screen, which promoted the degradation of APP and reduced APP-associated mitochondrial toxicity in an IRE1-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3033504345,"The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly evolved into an unprecedented crisis. The susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model and its variants have been used for modeling the pandemic. However, time-independent parameters in the classical models may not capture the dynamic transmission and removal processes, governed by virus containment strategies taken at various phases of the epidemic. Moreover, few models account for possible inaccuracies of the reported cases. We propose a Poisson model with time-dependent transmission and removal rates to account for possible random errors in reporting and estimate a time-dependent disease reproduction number, which may reflect the effectiveness of virus control strategies. We apply our method to study the pandemic in several severely impacted countries, and analyze and forecast the evolving spread of the coronavirus. We have developed an interactive web application to facilitate readers’ use of our method."

Augur employs a machine-learning framework to quantify the separability of perturbed and unperturbed cells within a high-dimensional space. We validate our method on single-cell RNA sequencing, chromatin accessibility and imaging transcriptomics datasets, and show that Augur outperforms existing methods based on differential gene expression. Augur identified the neural circuits restoring locomotion in mice following spinal cord neurostimulation."

https://openalex.org/W3042539412,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus linked to multiple birth defects including microcephaly, known as congenital ZIKV syndrome. The identification of host factors involved in ZIKV replication may guide efficacious therapeutic interventions. In genome-wide transcriptional studies, we found that ZIKV infection triggers aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation. Specifically, ZIKV infection induces kynurenine (Kyn) production, which activates AHR, limiting the production of type I interferons (IFN-I) involved in antiviral immunity. Moreover, ZIKV-triggered AHR activation suppresses intrinsic immunity driven by the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, which limits ZIKV replication. AHR inhibition suppressed the replication of multiple ZIKV strains in vitro and also suppressed replication of the related flavivirus dengue. Finally, AHR inhibition with a nanoparticle-delivered AHR antagonist or an inhibitor developed for human use limited ZIKV replication and ameliorated newborn microcephaly in a murine model. In summary, we identified AHR as a host factor for ZIKV replication and PML protein as a driver of anti-ZIKV intrinsic immunity. Giovannoni et al. report that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a novel host factor exploited by Zika virus and dengue virus to evade the immune response. AHR is a candidate target for the treatment of Zika virus congenital syndrome and dengue fever."
https://openalex.org/W3043134878,"Sleep is beneficial for learning. However, it remains unclear whether learning is facilitated by non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep or by REM sleep, whether it results from plasticity increases or stabilization, and whether facilitation results from learning-specific processing. Here, we trained volunteers on a visual task and measured the excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance in early visual areas during subsequent sleep as an index of plasticity. The E/I balance increased during NREM sleep irrespective of whether pre-sleep learning occurred, but it was associated with post-sleep performance gains relative to pre-sleep performance. In contrast, the E/I balance decreased during REM sleep but only after pre-sleep training, and the decrease was associated with stabilization of pre-sleep learning. These findings indicate that NREM sleep promotes plasticity, leading to performance gains independent of learning, while REM sleep decreases plasticity to stabilize learning in a learning-specific manner. Tamaki et al. measured MRS changes in sleeping humans trained on a visual task. During NREM sleep, learning gains were associated with enhanced visual cortical plasticity that was also seen independent of learning. REM sleep stabilized plasticity only after pre-sleep learning."
https://openalex.org/W3043631840,"Many experimental approaches rely on controlling gene expression in select subsets of cells within an individual animal. However, reproducibly targeting transgene expression to specific fractions of a genetically defined cell type is challenging. We developed Sparse Predictive Activity through Recombinase Competition (SPARC), a generalizable toolkit that can express any effector in precise proportions of post-mitotic cells in Drosophila. Using this approach, we demonstrate targeted expression of many effectors in several cell types and apply these tools to calcium imaging of individual neurons and optogenetic manipulation of sparse cell populations in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W3044267380,"This study investigates the environmental and economic impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on Annex I parties through an impact assessment by combining the propensity score matching and the difference-in-difference methods. We establish a country-level panel data set including CO2 emissions, gross domestic product (GDP), and other socioeconomic data for 1997–2008 and 2005–2008. Based on the impact evaluation, we conduct the simulation predicting the impacts of the Protocol to capture the differences of marginal damage cost of carbon emissions between the actual and counterfactual situations. The results suggest that participating as an Annex I party has a significant positive impact on CO2 emission reductions, but a negative impact on the GDP of the participants in the long run. The predicted marginal benefit of the Protocol based on the marginal damage cost of carbon emissions shows that the marginal benefit of emission reductions mitigates a limited portion of the GDP loss. Future global climate change frameworks should focus on balancing the impact on economic and environmental performance in order to ensure sustainable development, especially for developing countries that have low capacity to mitigate emissions."
https://openalex.org/W3043972279,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by abnormal deposition of post-translationally modified tau protein in the human brain. Tauopathies are associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and other diseases. Hyperphosphorylation increases tau tendency to aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), a pathological hallmark of AD. In this study, okadaic acid (OA, 100 nM), a protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor, was treated for 24h in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) and differentiated rat primary neuronal cortical cell cultures (CTX) to induce tau-hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization as a cell-based tauopathy model. Following the treatments, the effectiveness of different kinase inhibitors was assessed using the tauopathy-relevant tau antibodies through tau-immunoblotting, including the sites: pSer202/pThr205 (AT8), pThr181 (AT270), pSer202 (CP13), pSer396/pSer404 (PHF-1), and pThr231 (RZ3). OA-treated samples induced tau phosphorylation and oligomerization at all tested epitopes, forming a monomeric band (46–67 kDa) and oligomeric bands (170 kDa and 240 kDa). We found that TBB (a casein kinase II inhibitor), AR and LiCl (GSK-3 inhibitors), cyclosporin A (calcineurin inhibitor), and Saracatinib (Fyn kinase inhibitor) caused robust inhibition of OA-induced monomeric and oligomeric p-tau in both N2a and CTX culture. Additionally, a cyclin-dependent kinase 5 inhibitor (Roscovitine) and a calcium chelator (EGTA) showed contrasting results between the two neuronal cultures. This study provides a comprehensive view of potential drug candidates (TBB, CsA, AR, and Saracatinib), and their efficacy against tau hyperphosphorylation and oligomerization processes. These findings warrant further experimentation, possibly including animal models of tauopathies, which may provide a putative Neurotherapy for AD, CTE, and other forms of tauopathy-induced neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3045080402,"The TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) triggers apoptosis in cells by signaling through the O-glycosylated death receptors (DR4 and DR5), but the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis of cells varies, and the attributes of this phenomenon are complex. Human carcinoma cells often express truncated O-glycans, Tn (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr), and Sialyl-Tn (Siaα2-6GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr, STn) on their surface glycoproteins, yet molecular mechanisms in terms of advantages for tumor cells to have these truncated O-glycans remain elusive. Normal extended O-glycan biosynthesis is regulated by a specific molecular chaperone Cosmc through assisting of the correct folding of Core 1 β3 Galactosyltransferase (T-synthase). Here, we use tumor cell lines harboring mutations in Cosmc, and therefore expressing Tn and STn antigens to study the role of O-glycans in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Expression of Tn and STn in tumor cells attenuates their sensitivity to TRAIL treatment; when transfected with wild-type Cosmc, these tumor cells thus express normal extended O-glycans and become more sensitive to TRAIL treatment. Mechanistically, Tn/STn antigens impair homo-oligomerization and stability of DR4 and DR5. These results represent the first mechanistic insight into how O-glycan structures on cell surface modulate their sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, suggesting expression of Tn/STn may offer tumor cell survival advantages through altering DR4 and/or DR5 activity."
https://openalex.org/W3044671634,"Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a common drug that causes serious adverse events (SAEs). The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for SAEs due to PZA during first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment.The medical records of patients with tuberculosis (TB) treated with PZA-containing regimens including first-line drugs-ethambutol, rifampicin, and isoniazid-from January 2003 to June 2016 were reviewed. SAEs were defined as side effects that led to drug discontinuation. The causative drug was determined based on the disappearance of the SAEs upon drug withdrawal and/or the recurrence of the same SAEs with re-challenge.Of 2,478 patients with TB, 16.4% experienced SAEs. The incidence of SAEs increased significantly as age increased, except with rifampin. PZA accounted for most SAEs (55.8%). Hepatotoxicity was the most common SAE due to PZA (44.5%), followed by gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance (23.8%). The risk of SAEs due to PZA increased significantly as age increased, when sex and comorbidities were adjusted (odds ratio, 1.013; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-1.023; P = 0.007). In the subgroup analysis, older age was an independent risk factor for GI intolerance but not for hepatotoxicity.PZA was the most common drug associated with SAEs among the first-line anti-TB drugs, and old age was an independent factor for SAE occurrence. This study suggests that the early recognition of whether the causative agent is PZA may improve effective treatment compliance, particularly in elderly patients."
https://openalex.org/W3044965455,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an unexplained chronic, debilitating illness characterized by fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, orthostatic intolerance and gastrointestinal problems. Using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we analyzed the plasma proteomes of 39 ME/CFS patients and 41 healthy controls. Logistic regression models, with both linear and quadratic terms of the protein levels as independent variables, revealed a significant association between ME/CFS and the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) region 3-23/30. Stratifying the ME/CFS group based on self-reported irritable bowel syndrome (sr-IBS) status revealed a significant quadratic effect of immunoglobulin lambda constant region 7 on its association with ME/CFS with sr-IBS whilst IGHV3-23/30 and immunoglobulin kappa variable region 3–11 were significantly associated with ME/CFS without sr-IBS. In addition, we were able to predict ME/CFS status with a high degree of accuracy (AUC = 0.774–0.838) using a panel of proteins selected by 3 different machine learning algorithms: Lasso, Random Forests, and XGBoost. These algorithms also identified proteomic profiles that predicted the status of ME/CFS patients with sr-IBS (AUC = 0.806–0.846) and ME/CFS without sr-IBS (AUC = 0.754–0.780). Our findings are consistent with a significant association of ME/CFS with immune dysregulation and highlight the potential use of the plasma proteome as a source of biomarkers for disease."
https://openalex.org/W3044563075,"Ovarian cancer remains the sixth most frequently occurring cancer in women worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are capable of regulating gene expression, and thus, participating in a wide range of biological functions and disease processes including cancer development. Our work suggests that lncRNA TMPO antisense RNA 1 (TMPO-AS1) represents an oncogenic lncRNA in ovarian cancer and presents a novel mechanism involving transcription factor E2F transcription factor 6 (E2F6) and lipocalin-2 (LCN2). We identified upregulated lncRNA TMPO-AS1 in ovarian cancer tissues and cells. siRNA-mediated silencing of lncRNA TMPO-AS1 restrained the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer cells and their pro-angiogenic ability, and reduced the expression of LCN2. LncRNA TMPO-AS1 was found to interact with E2F6, a transcriptional repressor that could bind to the promoter region of LCN2 gene. In addition, silencing of E2F6 or overexpression of LCN2 restored the aggressiveness of ovarian cancer cells and their pro-angiogenic ability following siRNA-mediated silencing of lncRNA TMPO-AS1. Taken together, we demonstrated lncRNA TMPO-AS1 could potentially promote LCN2 transcriptional activity by binding to transcription factor E2F6, and thus, stimulated the progression of ovarian cancer. These findings underscore a possible alternative therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3044313630,"This study investigated the effects of kaempferol and zinc gluconate on neurobehavioural and oxidative stress changes in Wistar rats exposed to noise. Thirty (30) rats were randomly divided into five groups: Groups I and II were administered with deionized water (DW); Group III, kaempferol (K); Group IV, zinc gluconate (Zn); Group V, kaempferol + zinc gluconate. Groups II, III, IV, and V were subjected to noise stress (N) induced by exposing rats to 100 dB (4 h/day) for 15 days, from day 33 to day 48 after starting the drug treatments. Neuromuscular coordination, motor coordination, motor strength, sensorimotor reflex, and learning and memory, were evaluated using standard laboratory methods. Levels of nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated in the hippocampus. Exposure of rats to noise, induced significant neurobehavioural deficits and oxidative stress while the combined administration of kaempferol and zinc gluconate significantly (P < 0.05) improved open-field performance, motor coordination, motor strength, sensorimotor reflex, and learning and memory. Co-administration of kaempferol and zinc gluconate ameliorated noise-induced oxidative stress as demonstrated by the significantly increased activities of GPx, catalase, and SOD, and decreased levels of NO and MDA (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 respectively), compared to the DW + N group. Our results suggest that oxidative stress, evidenced by increased NO and MDA concentration and decreased activities of GPx, catalase and SOD, were involved in the molecular mechanism underlying neurobehavioural impairment in Wistar rats, exposed to noise stress. Single treatment of kaempferol exerted a more potent mitigative effect than zinc gluconate, while their combination produced an improved outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3044422798,"The main objective of this pilot study was to identify circulatory microRNAs in aqueous or plasma that were reflecting changes in vitreous of diabetic retinopathy patients. Aqueous, vitreous and plasma samples were collected from a total of 27 patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery: 11 controls (macular pucker or macular hole patients) and 16 with diabetes mellitus(DM): DM-Type I with proliferative diabetic retinopathy(PDR) (DMI-PDR), DM Type II with PDR(DMII-PDR) and DM Type II with nonproliferative DR(DMII-NPDR). MicroRNAs were isolated using Qiagen microRNeasy kit, quantified on BioAnalyzer, and profiled on Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.0 microarrays. Data were analyzed using Expression Console, Transcriptome Analysis Console, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The comparison analysis of circulatory microRNAs showed that out of a total of 847 human microRNA probes on the microarrays, common microRNAs present both in aqueous and vitreous were identified, and a large number of unique microRNA, dependent on the DM type and severity of retinopathy. Most of the dysregulated microRNAs in aqueous and vitreous of DM patients were upregulated, while in plasma, they were downregulated. Dysregulation of miRNAs in aqueous did not appear to be a good representative of the miRNA abundance in vitreous, or plasma, although a few potential candidates for common biomarkers stood out: let-7b, miR-320b, miR-762 and miR-4488. Additionally, each of the DR subtypes showed miRNAs that were uniquely dysregulated in each fluid (i.e. aqueous: for DMII-NPDR was miR-455-3p; for DMII-PDR was miR-296, and for DMI-PDR it was miR-3202). Pathway analysis identified TGF-beta and VEGF pathways affected. The comparative profiling of circulatory miRNAs showed that a small number of them displayed differential presence in diabetic retinopathy vs. controls. A pattern is emerging of unique molecular microRNA signatures in bodily fluids of DR subtypes, offering promise for the use of ocular fluids and plasma for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3044815386,"The definitive characterization of common cancer stem cell (CSCs) subpopulations in breast cancer subtypes with distinct genotypic and phenotypic features remains an ongoing challenge. In this study, we have used a non-biased genome wide screening approach to identify transcriptional networks that may be specific to the CSC subpopulations in both luminal and basal breast cancer subtypes. In depth studies of three CSC-enriched breast cancer cell lines representing various subtypes of breast cancer revealed a striking hyperactivation of the mevalonate metabolic pathway in comparison to control cells. The upregulation of metabolic networks is a key feature of tumour cells securing growth and proliferative capabilities and dysregulated mevalonate metabolism has been associated with tumour malignancy and cellular transformation in breast cancer. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that Simvastatin therapy, a mevalonate pathway inhibitor, could affect breast cancer progression and reduce breast cancer recurrence. When detailing the mevalonate pathway in breast cancer using a single-cell qPCR, we identified the mevalonate precursor enzyme, HMGCS1, as a specific marker of CSC-enriched subpopulations within both luminal and basal tumour subtypes. Down-regulation of HMGCS1 also decreased the CSC fraction and function in various model systems, suggesting that HMGCS1 is essential for CSC-activities in breast cancer in general. These data was supported by strong associations between HMGCS1 expression and aggressive features, such as high tumour grade, p53 mutations as well as ER-negativity in lymph node positive breast cancer. Importantly, loss of HMGCS1 also had a much more pronounced effect on CSC-activities compared to treatment with standard doses of Simvastatin. Taken together, this study highlights HMGCS1 as a potential gatekeeper for dysregulated mevalonate metabolism important for CSC-features in both luminal and basal breast cancer subtypes. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGCS1 could therefore be a superior novel treatment approach for breast cancer patients via additional CSC blocking functions."
https://openalex.org/W3044833215,"Terrestrial nanoplastics (NPs) pose a serious threat to agricultural food production systems due to the potential harm of soil-born micro- and macroorganisms that promote soil fertility and ability of NPs to adsorb onto and penetrate into vegetables and other crops. Very little is known about the dispersion, fate and transport of NPs in soils. This is because of the challenges of analyzing terrestrial NPs by conventional microscopic techniques due to the low concentrations of NPs and absence of optical transparency in these systems. Herein, we investigate the potential utility of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and Ultra SANS (USANS) to probe the agglomeration behavior of NPs prepared from polybutyrate adipate terephthalate, a prominent biodegradable plastic used in agricultural mulching, in the presence of vermiculite, an artificial soil. SANS with the contrast matching technique was used to study the aggregation of NPs co-dispersed with vermiculite in aqueous media. We determined the contrast match point for vermiculite was 66% D2O / 33% H2O. At this condition, the signal for vermiculite was ~50–100%-fold lower that obtained using neat H2O or D2O as solvent. According to SANS and USANS, smaller-sized NPs (50 nm) remained dispersed in water and did not undergo size reduction or self-agglomeration, nor formed agglomerates with vermiculite. Larger-sized NPs (300–1000 nm) formed self-agglomerates and agglomerates with vermiculite, demonstrating their significant adhesion with soil. However, employment of convective transport (simulated by ex situ stirring of the slurries prior to SANS and USANS analyses) reduced the self-agglomeration, demonstrating weak NP-NP interactions. Convective transport also led to size reduction of the larger-sized NPs. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential utility of SANS and USANS with contrast matching technique for investigating behavior of terrestrial NPs in complex soil systems."
https://openalex.org/W3044703879,"Adipocytes are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells through adipogenesis. Pre-adipocyte differentiation in poultry greatly influences fat deposition and meat quality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have an important function in cancer and some differentiation processes. Herein, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to detect circRNAs present in cherry valley duck pre-adipocyte and adipocyte differentiation over 3 days. We identified 9,311 circRNAs and 141 differentially expressed circRNAs. Sequencing results were verified through qRT-PCR using seven randomly selected circRNAs, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were exhibited by ten important circRNAs in duck adipocyte differentiation. circRNA plexin A1 (circ-PLXNA1) was detected in duck adipocytes and mainly expressed in adipose, leg muscle and liver. Inhibition of circ-PLXNA1 limited the differentiation of duck adipocyte. There were four corresponding miRNAs for circ-PLXNA1 and 313 target genes for those miRNAs. CeRNA“circ-PLXNA1/miR-214/CTNNB1 axis” was focused and verified by a dual-luciferase reporter experiment. After co-transfection of cells with si-circ-PLXNA1 and miR-214 mimics, the expression level of CTNNB1 was down-regulated, triglyceride content and the adipogenic capacity of preadipocytes decreased. While there were no significant change after si-CTNNB1 transfection. All these results provide further insight into the circRNAs, especially for circ-PLXNA1 in duck adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3042507802,"The NUDIX hydrolase NUDT15 was originally implicated in sanitizing oxidized nucleotides, but was later shown to hydrolyze the active thiopurine metabolites, 6-thio-(d)GTP, thereby dictating the clinical response of this standard-of-care treatment for leukemia and inflammatory diseases. Nonetheless, its physiological roles remain elusive. Here, we sought to develop small-molecule NUDT15 inhibitors to elucidate its biological functions and potentially to improve NUDT15-dependent chemotherapeutics. Lead compound TH1760 demonstrated low-nanomolar biochemical potency through direct and specific binding into the NUDT15 catalytic pocket and engaged cellular NUDT15 in the low-micromolar range. We also employed thiopurine potentiation as a proxy functional readout and demonstrated that TH1760 sensitized cells to 6-thioguanine through enhanced accumulation of 6-thio-(d)GTP in nucleic acids. A biochemically validated, inactive structural analog, TH7285, confirmed that increased thiopurine toxicity takes place via direct NUDT15 inhibition. In conclusion, TH1760 represents the first chemical probe for interrogating NUDT15 biology and potential therapeutic avenues. TH1760 is a first-in-class, potent, selective and cell-active inhibitor against human NUDT15, which sensitizes cells to 6-thioguanine treatment. TH1760 represents a valuable tool for deciphering the enigmatic functions of NUDT15."
https://openalex.org/W3045418589,"Epigenetic age acceleration—the difference between an individual’s DNA methylation age and chronological age—is associated with many diseases including cancer. This study aims to evaluate epigenetic age acceleration as a prognostic biomarker for gliomas. DNA methylation data of gliomas patients (516 low-grade and intermediate-grade gliomas and 140 glioblastoma) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and patient epigenetic ages were computed using Horvath’s age prediction model. We used multivariate linear regression to assess the association of epigenetic age acceleration with tumor molecular subtypes, including Codel, Classic-like, G-CIMP-high, G-CIMP-low, Mesenchymal-like and PA-like. Compared with Codel subtype, epigenetic ages in other molecular subtypes show deceleration after controlling age and race. Age deceleration for Classic-like, G-CIMP-high, G-CIMP-low, Mesenchymal-like and PA-like were 15.42 years (CI: 7.98–22.86, p = 5.38E-05), 25.00 years (CI: 20.79–29.22, p = 4.06E-28), 28.56 years (CI: 14.37–42.74, p = 8.75E-05), 45.34 years (CI: 38.80–51.88, p = 2.15E-36), and 53.58 years (CI: 44.90–62.26, p = 4.81E-30), respectively. Then, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association of epigenetic age acceleration with patient overall survival. Our results show epigenetic age acceleration is positively associated with patient overall survival (per 10-year age acceleration, HR = 0.89; 95%CI: 0.82–0.97; p = 9.04E-03) in multivariate analysis. When stratified by molecular subtypes, epigenetic age acceleration remains positively associated with patient survival after adjusting age and tumor grade. In conclusion, epigenetic age acceleration is significantly associated with molecular subtypes and patient overall survival in gliomas, indication that epigenetic age acceleration has potential as a quantitative prognostic biomarker for gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W3044236261,"Breast cancer (BC) is the foremost cause of cancer related deaths in women globally. Currently there is a scarcity of reliable biomarkers for its early stage diagnosis and theranostics monitoring. Altered DNA methylation patterns leading to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes are considered as an important mechanism underlying tumor development and progression in various cancer types, including BC. Very recently, epigenetic silencing of SHISA3, an antagonist of β-catenin, has been reported in various types of tumor. However, the role of SHISA3 in BC has not been investigated yet. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the contribution of SHISA3 in BC causation by analyzing its expression and methylation levels in BC cell lines (MDA-MB231, MCF-7 and BT-474) and in 103 paired BC tissue samples. The SHISA3 expression and methylation status was determined by qPCR and methylation specific PCR (MSP) respectively. The role of SHISA3 in BC tumorigenesis was evaluated by proliferation and migration assays after ectopic expression of SHISA3. The association between SHISA3 hypermethylation and clinicopathological parameters of BC patients was also studied. The downregulation of SHISA3 expression was found in three BC cell lines used and in all BC tissue samples. However, SHISA3 promoter region was hypermethylated in 61% (63/103) tumorous tissues in comparison to the 18% of their matched normal tissues. The 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine treatment restored SHISA3 expression by reversing promoter hypermethylation in both MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of SHISA3 significantly reduced the proliferation and migration ability of these cells. Taken together, our findings for the first time reveal epigenetic silencing and tumor suppressing role of SHISA3 in BC. Henceforth, this study has identified SHISA3 as potentially powerful target for the development of new therapies against BC, as well as novel diagnostic and therapy response monitoring approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3044246931,"Fatigue limit load is one of the most important and concerned factors in designing and manufacturing critical mechanical parts such as the crankshafts. Usually, this governing parameter is obtained by experiment, which is expensive, time-consuming and only feasible in analyzing the case of simple structure. Still, there's a big obstacle to clear to get the fatigue limit load of a sophisticated structure effectively and efficiently. This paper applied the stress field intensity theory to make quick component fatigue limit load predictions. First, the field diameter of a given crankshaft was determined based on its limit stress state and a stress distribution fitting approach. Then, this parameter was used to predict the high-cycle bending fatigue limit load of a new crankshaft composed of the same material. Finally, a corresponding experimental verification was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. The results indicated that the original stress field intensity model may not be suitable due to the errors in the predictions, which can be attributed to the structural features. The new model proposed in this paper can provide higher accuracy in quick fatigue load prediction, making it superior to the traditional model in engineering application."

The intemperate exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation can cause excessive cellular oxidative stress, leading to skin damage, proteins damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. There is sufficient evidences supporting the proposal that mitochondria is highly implicated in skin photo-damage.In the present study, a polysaccharide isolated from Astragalus membranaceus was further purified to be an α-glucan, which was further investigated its beneficial influence on UVA-induced photo-damage in HaCaT cells.Our results showed that the purified Astragalus membranaceus polysaccharide (AP) can protect HaCaT cells from UVA-induced photo-damage through reducing UVA-induced intracellular ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby altering ATP content. It was found that the UVA induced damage in HaCaT cells could be effectively restored by co-treatment with AP.AP exhibited promising potential for advanced application as multifunctional skin care products and drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3043253049,"Stunning advances in the structural biology of multicomponent biomolecular complexes (MBCs) have ushered in an era of intense, structure-guided mechanistic and functional studies of these complexes. Nonetheless, existing methods to site-specifically conjugate MBCs with biochemical and biophysical labels are notoriously impracticable and/or significantly perturb MBC assembly and function. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a general, multiplexed method in which we genomically encode non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into multiple, structure-informed, individual sites within a target MBC; select for ncAA-containing MBC variants that assemble and function like the wildtype MBC; and site-specifically conjugate biochemical or biophysical labels to these ncAAs. As a proof-of-principle, we have used this method to generate unique single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) signals reporting on ribosome structural dynamics that have thus far remained inaccessible to smFRET studies of translation. A method combining multiplexed genome engineering, genetic code expansion and biorthogonal chemical labeling has been developed for multiple site-specific protein labeling and used to label ribosome components at sites hard to access for FRET assays."
https://openalex.org/W3043876605,"This study aimed to examine the amount of lifestyle counseling that Dutch general practitioners (GPs) generally provide to their patients, as well as the behavioral determinants of their lifestyle counseling practices. Lifestyle counseling was defined and operationalized through the 5As model (i.e. Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist and Arrange), while determinants were based on an adapted version of the theory of planned behavior. A cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of 198 GPs, using an online survey questionnaire for collecting data. The results showed that 79.3% of the GPs assessed patients’ current lifestyle often or always, while 60.1% reported they often or always assessed patients’ motivation to improve their lifestyle. Depending on the lifestyle behavior, Advising to improve lifestyle ranged from 42.5% (sleep) to 92.4% (smoking), while Agree to set goals ranged from 21.7% (sleep) to 46.9% (smoking). Assisting patients to overcome barriers to lifestyle changes varied per patient barrier, ranging from lack of financial resources (25.7%) to stress (81.8%). The findings from the linear hierarchical regression revealed that GPs’ self-efficacy (β = .46, p < .001), patient norm (β = .21, p < .001), and attitude (β = .20, p < .05) were the determinants with the strongest associations with lifestyle counseling. The full model explained 47% of the variance in counseling lifestyle. Implications for supporting GPs to counsel patients about their lifestyle are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3044004652,"It is estimated that one of the potential cause of the increasing prevalence of thyroid cancer (TC) is the easier and widespread access to diagnostic tools. If an individual evaluates the thyroid gland due to a mentioned mechanism without considering TC risk factors or symptoms, we can describe this phenomenon as cancer screening activity (CSA).We 1) estimated what types of TC were diagnosed due to CSA, 2) analyzed what clinicopathological features were characteristic of TCs diagnosed by CSA, 3) determined if these features were characteristic of indolent cases, and finally we 4) assessed whether CSA could have resulted in the increasing incidence of potentially indolent papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).A retrospective review of 4,701 medical records of patients admitted and surgically treated at one surgical center between 2008 and 2017 was performed. Among the enrolled patients, 569 (12.1%) had thyroid malignancy, and 514 (10.9%) were diagnosed with PTC. We divided these patients into two groups: 1) patients in whom TC diagnostics were performed without considering any TC risk factors or symptoms (CSA-yes) and 2) those in whom TC was diagnosed due to TC risk factors or symptoms (CSA-no). We then compared the clinicopathological features of these two groups.The most common type of TC diagnosed in the CSA-group was PTC (p = 0.024). CSA-yes patients showed a significantly lower degree of Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging and demonstrated a significantly lower rate of multifocality, but not of bilaterality (p<0.0001 and p = 0.198, respectively). In the CSA-yes group, the number of TC foci was significantly lower than that in the CSA-no group (p<0.0001). All clinicopathological features characteristic of aggressive cases of TC were absent in CSA-yes patients (p<0.0001), while all features observed in CSA-yes patients were characteristic of indolent cases (p<0.0001).The use of CSA results in the diagnosis of indolent cases of PTC and may be one of the potential causes of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of this malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W3044068459,"Ability self-concept (SC) and self-efficacy (SE) are central competence-related self-perceptions that affect students’ success in educational settings. Both constructs show conceptual differences but their empirical differentiation in higher education has not been sufficiently demonstrated. In the present study, we investigated the empirical differentiation of SC and SE in higher education with N = 1,243 German psychology students (81% female; age M = 23.62 years), taking into account central methodological requirements that, in part, have been neglected in prior studies. SC and SE were assessed at the same level of specificity, only cognitive SC items were used, and multiple academic domains were considered. We modeled the structure of SC and SE taking into account a multidimensional and/or hierarchical structure and investigated the empirical differentiation of both constructs on different levels of generality (i.e., domain-specific and domain-general). Results supported the empirical differentiation of SC and SE with medium-sized positive latent correlations (range r = .57 - .68) between SC and SE on different levels of generality. The knowledge about the internal structure of students’ SC and SE and the differentiation of both constructs can help us to develop construct-specific and domain-specific intervention strategies. Future empirical comparisons of the predictive power of SC and SE can provide further evidence that both represent empirical different constructs."
https://openalex.org/W3044847294,"Understanding the feeding behavior and host choice of sand flies provides valuable information on vector-host relationships and elucidates the epidemiological patterns of leishmaniasis transmission. Blood meal analysis studies are essential for estimating the efficiency of pathogen transmission, assessing the relative human disease risk, and assist in identifying the other potential hosts of leishmaniasis. In Sudan and most of East Africa, there are large remaining gaps in knowledge regarding the feeding habits of phlebotomine vectors. The study aimed to identify the blood meal sources and, therefore, the host preferences of the principal vectors Phlebotomus orientalis and Ph. papatasi in leishmaniasis endemic areas of eastern and central Sudan.Sand flies were collected from two endemic villages in eastern and central Sudan using CDC light traps and sticky traps. The phlebotomine sand flies were morphologically and then molecularly identified. The source of blood meal of the engorged females was determined using a multiplex PCR methodology and specific primers of cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA for human, goat, cow, and dog. The detection of the Leishmania parasite was done using PCR.The total number of collected female phlebotomine sand flies was 180. Morphological identification revealed the abundance of Ph. orientalis 103 (57.2%), Ph. papatasi 42 (23.3%), Ph. bergeroti 31 (17.2%), Ph. rodhaini 2 (1.1%) and Ph. duboscqi 2 (1.1%) in the study sites. Out of the 180 collected, 31 (17%) were blood-fed flies. Three species were blood-fed and molecularly identified: Ph. papatasi (N = 7, 22.6%), Ph. bergeroti (N = 9, 26%), and Ph. orientalis (N = 15, 48.4%). Blood meal analysis revealed human DNA in two Ph. orientalis (6.4%), hence, the anthropophilic index was 13.3%.Multiplex PCR protocol described here allowed the identification of blood meal sources of many vertebrate species simultaneously. The results indicate that wild-caught Ph. orientalis are anthropophilic in the study areas. Further studies on larger blood-fed sample size are required to validate the potential applications of this technique in designing, monitoring and evaluating control programs, particularly in investigating the potential non-human hosts of leishmaniasis."
https://openalex.org/W3045353634,"The development of sustainable agricultural systems in drylands is currently a crucial issue in the context of mitigating the outcomes of population growth under the conditions of climatic changes. The need to meet the growing demand for food, fodder, and fuel, together with the hazards due to climate change, requires cross-disciplinary studies of ways to increase livelihood while minimizing the impact on the environment. Practices of agroforestry systems, in which herbaceous species are intercropped between rows of woody species plantations, have been shown to mitigate several of the predicaments of climatic changes. Focusing on agroforestry in drylands, we address the question of how we can improve the performance of agroforestry systems in those areas. As vegetation in drylands tends to self-organize in various patterns, it seems essential to explore the various patterns that agroforestry systems tend to form and their impact on the performance of these systems in terms of biomass production, resilience to droughts, and water use efficiency. We use a two-soil-layers vegetation model to study the relationship between deep-rooted woody vegetation and shallow herbaceous vegetation, and explore how self-organization in different spatial patterns influences the performance of agroforestry systems. We focus on three generic classes of patterns, spots, gaps, and stripes, assess these patterns using common metrics for agroforestry systems, and examine their resilience to droughts. We show that in contrast to the widespread practice of planting the woody and herbaceous species in alternating rows, that is, in a stripe pattern, planting the woody species in hexagonal spot patterns may increase the system's resilience to droughts. Furthermore, hexagonal spot patterns reduce the suppression of herbs growth by the woody vegetation, therefore maintaining higher crop yields. We conclude by discussing some limitations of this study and their significance."
https://openalex.org/W3045370960,"Macropinocytosis supports the metabolic requirement of RAS-transformed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDACs). However, regulators of RAS-transformation (activation) that lead to macropinocytosis have not been identified. Herein, we report that UBAP2 (ubiquitin-binding associated protein 2), regulates the activation of KRAS and macropinocytosis in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrate that UBAP2 is highly expressed in both pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissues of PDAC patients. The expression of UBAP2 is associated with poor overall survival in several cancers, including PDAC. Silencing UBAP2 decreases the levels of activated KRAS, and inhibits macropinocytosis, and tumor growth in vivo. Using a UBAP2-deletion construct, we demonstrate that the UBA-domain of UBAP2 is critical for the regulation of macropinocytosis and maintaining the levels of activated KRAS. In addition, UBAP2 regulates RAS downstream signaling and helps maintain RAS in the GTP-bound form. However, the exact mechanism by which UBAP2 regulates KRAS activation is unknown and needs further investigation. Thus, UBAP2 may be exploited as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit macropinocytosis and tumor growth in activated KRAS-driven cancers."

Northwest region-Cameroon having the second epidemiological burden of HIV infection, generating data on PDR in these geographical settings, will enhance evidence-based decision-making.We sought to ascertain levels of PDR and HIV-1 clade dispersal in rural and urban settings, and their potential association with subtype distribution and CD4-staging.A cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017 among patients recently diagnosed with HIV-infection and initiating ART at the Bamenda regional Hospital (urban setting) and the Mbingo Baptist hospital (rural setting). Protease and reverse transcriptase sequencing was performed using an in-house protocol and pre-treatment drug resistance mutations were interpreted using Stanford HIVdb.v8.3. Phylogeny was performed for subtype assignation.A total of 61 patient sequences were generated from ART initiators (median age: 37 years old; 57.4% female; median CD4 cell count: 184 [IQR: 35-387] in urban vs. 161 [IQR: 96-322] cells/mm3 in rural). Overall, the level of PDR was 9.8% (6/61). Of note, burden of PDR was almost doubled in urban (12.9% [4/31]) compared to rural setting 6.7% (2/30), p = 0.352). Fifteen (15) PDR mutations were found among four patients the urban settings [6 resistance mutations to NRTIs:[M41L (2), E44D (1), K65R (1), K70E (1), M184V/I (2), K219R (1)] and 6 resistance mutations to NNRTIs: K103N (1), E138A/G (2), V179E (1), M230L (1), K238T (1), P225H (1)] against two (02) mutations found in two patients in the rural setting[2 resistant mutations to NNRTIs: E138A (1) and Y188H (1)]. The rural setting showed more genetic diversity (8 subtypes) than the urban setting (5 subtypes), with CRF02_AG being the most prevalent clade (72.1% [44/61]). Of note, level of PDR was similar between patients infected with CRF02_AG and non-CRF02_AG infected (9.1% [4/44]) vs. 11.8% [2/17]), p = 1.000). Moreover, PDR appeared higher in patients with CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 compared to those with CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/mm3 (14.7% [5/34]) vs. 3.7% [1/27]), p = 0.214).PDR is at a moderate rate in the Northwest region of Cameroon, with higher burden within urban populations. CRF02_AG is the most predominant clade in both urban and rural settings. No effect of HIV molecular epidemiology and CD4-staging on the presence of PDR in patients living in these settings was found. Our findings suggest close monitoring, NNRTI-sparing regimens or sequencing for patients initiating ART, especially in urban settings."
https://openalex.org/W3044410820,"Given the current shortage of respirator masks and the resulting lack of personal protective equipment for use by clinical staff, we examined bottom-up solutions that would allow hospitals to fabricate respirator masks that: (i) meet requirements in terms of filtering capacities, (ii) are easy to produce rapidly and locally, and (iii) can be constructed using materials commonly available in hospitals worldwide. We found that Halyard H300 material used for wrapping of surgical instruments and routinely available in hospitals, met these criteria. Specifically, three layers of material achieved a filter efficiency of 94%, 99%, and 100% for 0.3 μm, 0.5 μm, and 3.0 μm particles, respectively; importantly, these values are close to the efficiency provided by FFP2 and N95 masks. After re-sterilization up to 5 times, the filter’s efficiency remains sufficiently high for use as an FFP1 respirator mask. Finally, using only one layer of the material satisfies the criteria for use as a ‘surgical mask’. This material can therefore be used to help protect hospital staff and other healthcare professionals who require access to high quality masks but lack commercially available solutions."

We therefore aimed to develop and validate an accurate prognosis model for incident COPD cases using only information present in general practitioner (GP) records at the point of diagnosis. Incident COPD patients between 2004–2012 over the age of 35 were studied using records from 396 general practices in England. We developed a model to predict all-cause five-year mortality at the point of COPD diagnosis, using 47,964 English patients. Our model uses age, gender, smoking status, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1-second (FEV1) % predicted and 16 co-morbidities (the same number as the Charlson Co-morbidity Index). The performance of our chosen model was validated in all countries of the UK (N = 48,304). Our model performed well, and performed consistently in validation data. The validation area under the curves in each country varied between 0.783–0.809 and the calibration slopes between 0.911–1.04. Our model performed better in this context than models based on the Charlson Co-morbidity Index or Cambridge Multimorbidity Score. We have developed and validated a model that outperforms general multimorbidity scores at predicting five-year mortality after COPD diagnosis. Our model includes only data routinely collected before COPD diagnosis, allowing it to be readily translated into clinical practice, and has been made available through an online risk calculator (https://skiddle.shinyapps.io/incidentcopdsurvival/)."

In Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia, 2% and 1.5% of the general population is infected with HTLV-1 or HCV. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and the distribution of HTLV/HCV coinfection in Bahia. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Central Laboratory of Public Health for the state of Bahia (LACEN-BA). All samples in the LACEN database submitted to serological testing for anti-HCV (chemiluminescence) and anti-HTLV-1/2 (chemiluminescence/ELISA and Western blot) from 2004 to 2013 were included. Infection rate was expressed as the number of infected individuals per 100,000 inhabitants in a given municipality; municipalities were grouped by microregion for further analysis. A total of 120,192 samples originating from 358 of the 417 municipalities in Bahia (85.8%) were evaluated. The overall HCV coinfection rate in HTLV-positive was 14.31% [2.8 (ranging from 0.4 to 8.0) per 100,000 inhabitants.] Twenty-one (5%) of the municipalities reported at least one case of HTLV/HCV coinfection. Most cases (87%) were concentrated in three microregions (Salvador: 79%, Ilhéus/Itabuna: 5%, Porto Seguro: 3%). Coinfection occurred more frequently in males (51%) with a mean age of 59 [(IQR): 46–59] years. HTLV/HCV coinfection in the state of Bahia was more frequently found among males living in the microregions of Salvador, Ilhéus/Itabuna and Porto Seguro, all of which are known to be endemic for HTLV infection."

TReND is a volunteer-scientist run charity dedicated to promoting research and education on the African continent. Focusing on neuroscience, we discuss approaches to address some of the factors that currently stifle Africa’s scientific development and our experience in implementing them. If Ebola, Zika, or the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have taught us anything, it might be that in modern life sciences, there is no such thing as a local problem. Accordingly, now more than ever, we need to increase global research capacity and expand scientific literacy, with a focus on those parts of the world that have traditionally been left behind the most. This notably includes large stretches of the African continent, which is home to one in seven people worldwide but contributes less than 2% to the global research output (Thelwall, 2017Thelwall M. Trend of African scientific output and impact 1996–2015.African J. Libr. Arch. Inf. Sci. 2017; 27: 131-143Google Scholar). Here, we urgently need to a reach a critical mass of well-trained and internationally connected scientists supported by scientifically literate citizens and governments, which can tackle problems before they enter the world stage. Access to higher education and current scientific progress remains a scarce resource across large parts of the African continent. Capacity building projects have classically focused on primary and secondary education, with comparatively little attention directed toward the critical roles of the tertiary tier, although this trend has steadily changed in recent decades (Riddell and Niño-Zarazúa, 2016Riddell A. Niño-Zarazúa M. The effectiveness of foreign aid to education: What can be learned?.Int. J. Educ. Dev. 2016; 48: 23-36Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Top-level science education and primary research are pivotal to the ability to innovate, move forward, and meaningfully integrate with the global society. Moreover, better positioned universities train better teachers and boost scientific literacy in the population. A flourishing research landscape also promises to increase the willingness of governments to formulate evidence-based policy. Though small when compared to its total population, Africa boasts a substantial university and research landscape, with countries including South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, or The Gambia hosting some of the world’s leading research institutes in various fields (https://research.webometrics.info/en/Africa). Several African universities, led by the University of Cape Town in South Africa, are ranked in world university league tables. Clearly, the continent hosts an ever-growing number of scientists with potentially game-changing ideas. These factors form a solid base upon which educational and research development initiatives can operate. The problem, however, is that examples of leading African research institutes are sparse when considering the continent as a whole. This is compounded by a series of challenges that many African-based researchers and educators endure. Beside obvious factors, such as poor funding, unreliable power grids, and difficulties in importing specialized equipment and reagents, one pressing issue is a disconnect from the global scientific community. Researchers in the Global North typically learn about scientific advances long before they are formally published by attending conferences and by maintaining close personal dialogs with colleagues. In contrast, attendance at international conferences by African-based researchers is routinely obstructed by funding, visa issues, or a crushing overload in administrative duties. This hampers the development of important personal contacts with researchers abroad and thus leads to a lack of access to information about the field’s current state. Journal paywalls are a further complication, although initiatives like the HINARI program (http://www.who.int/hinari/), the rise of open-access outlets, increased adoption of preprint servers, and the formulation of Plan-S (https://www.coalition-s.org/) have made progress toward addressing this problem. These access issues compound with another prevalent problem at many African universities: the dramatic shortage of teaching personnel. Besides administration, senior academics usually face a crushing teaching overload, often having to run multiple repeats of crowded seminars for hundreds of students at a time in sometimes woefully inadequate teaching spaces (Marais, 2016Marais P. “We can’t believe what we see”: Overcrowded classrooms through the eyes of student teachers.S. Afr. J. Educ. 2016; 36https://doi.org/10.15700/saje.v36n2a1201Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To fill this teaching gap, universities routinely employ junior academics (often at the MSc level) to teach. This practice has led to a vicious cycle of low teaching quality where even theoretical aspects of many topics are only superficially covered. This is finally worsened by a near complete absence of practical training in modern research approaches in university science curricula (Ozor et al., 2016Ozor N. Nti Acheampong E. Sena Lamptey A. Njagi D. Improving the Relevance of University Training to Labour Market Demands in Africa. African Technol. Policy Stud. Netw, 2016Google Scholar). Per one million inhabitants, most African countries have fewer than 100 researchers—compared to a global average of currently 1,080 researchers and more than 4,000 researchers in scientific powerhouses like the UK, USA, or Japan (http://chartsbin.com/view/1124). Similarly, on average, 3 neurologists serve 10 million people in Africa, compared to nearly 500 neurologists in Europe (Mateen et al., 2016Mateen F.J. Clark S.J. Borzello M. Kabore J. Seidi O. Neurology training in sub-Saharan Africa: A survey of people in training from 19 countries.Ann. Neurol. 2016; 79: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These numbers contrast with forecasts that by 2050, 71% of people living with dementia or related neurological conditions will be from low-to-middle income countries, which currently includes most African countries (Prince et al., 2013Prince M. Bryce R. Albanese E. Wimo A. Ribeiro W. Ferri C.P. The global prevalence of dementia: a systematic review and metaanalysis.Alzheimers Dement. 2013; 9: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). Ultimately, long-term solutions to problems such as these must come from within Africa, with concerted actions from governments and African-based philanthropists supporting a thriving African research sector. However, in parallel, it will be critical to better integrate African neuroscientists into the global scientific community. In 2011, to catalyze these efforts and to contribute to the development of a truly global scientific community, with an initial focus on neuroscience, we founded the non-profit organization TReND in Africa (https://www.TReNDinAfrica.org). Here, we summarize our actions (Figure 1) in the context of other programs with closely aligned goals, focusing on (1) (neuro)science capacity building, (2) promoting scientific exchange, and (3) public outreach and policy engagement. A plethora of advanced, hands-on neuroscience courses are offered across the Global North, including those by Woods Hole Marine laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies (FENS), or the CAJAL program. Many of today’s most influential neuroscientists were once students at courses such as these, and for some, they remain instrumental to their careers even years later. Yet, despite the international nature of these courses, few participants come from Africa. Instead, African-based students are rarely selected in view of their often comparatively limited research experience, an absence of glowing recommendation letters from well-known scientists, and/or the applications’ formatting to different cultural expectations. Even when selected, a student’s ability to attend a course is routinely hampered by lack of funding, even when partial scholarships are provided, or by visa requirements. Finally, if all these hurdles are overcome, attendees often realize that much of the training received might be difficult to apply when faced with the realities of the research infrastructure back at home. This can have a counterproductive effect, with some applicants leaving these courses more discouraged to pursue research than when they first applied. Realizing these limitations, international organizations, such as the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) and the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN), have invested into funding neuroscience training courses in Africa. Building on these efforts and with help from a wide range of additional funders (see Acknowledgments), TReND organizes top-level and hands-on training courses in collaboration with African universities and research institutions (Figures 1A–1D). To date, we have trained ∼500 African young scientists through more than twenty intensive and multi-week research schools. We cover diverse disciplines, including neurogenetics, neurophysiology, molecular biology, genome editing, bioinformatics, open hardware, general lab and research skills, and scientific writing (Figures 1A and 1B). To ensure equal opportunity, all courses are free of charge and usually cover travel costs and board. Ensuring gender balance as much as possible (Figure 1B), typically 15–20 participants per course from late undergraduate to faculty level are selected among candidates applying from all over Africa, with an acceptance rate of usually <10%. TReND courses are delivered by worldwide leading researchers and have a strong emphasis on hands-on training, with at least half of the course spent in lab-based practicals. All TReND courses take place in Africa, and we complement existing resources with donated scientific hardware and reagents to ensure that the taught state-of-the-art techniques can be replicated in a typical African university setting. We therefore combine our courses with an equipment donation program (Figure 1E), available to our alumni and partner universities. The need for research-grade equipment in emerging economies has long been recognized, for example, by the WHO equipment funding programs and non-profit organizations, such as Seeding Labs (https://seedinglabs.org). Industry and well-funded laboratories often discard or store fully functioning equipment and reagents that have become superfluous to current requirements, yet they present a vast resource for underfunded labs around the world. Our equipment donation program aims to activate these resources for African universities. Importantly, African countries should not be the end point of e-waste, nor should shipped equipment end up unused. For this reason, we thoroughly test all donated equipment prior to shipping and link donations with courses or volunteer visits (see below) to make sure that there is expertise on site to efficiently make use of the donated equipment. Another defining feature of our courses is a strong focus on open science, including the promotion of free and open-source software and do-it-yourself (DIY) equipment based on open-source hardware designs (Baden et al., 2015Baden T. Chagas A.M. Gage G.J. Marzullo T.C. Prieto-Godino L.L. Euler T. Open Labware: 3-D printing your own lab equipment.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13: e1002086Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar; Tsanni, 2020Tsanni A. African scientists leverage open hardware.Nature. 2020; 582: 138Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). We also teach how to build or repair equipment based on off-the-shelf electronics and 3D printed parts—either as part of an introductory week or as dedicated courses in their own right. These activities reinforce a mentality of innovation and frugality and dispel the commonly held misconception that state-of-the-art research categorically requires expensive equipment. In general, we adapt all aspects of taught materials to local realities, including local budget constraints. This includes discussions on the most appropriate model organism to each research question. Therefore, many courses focus on the use of genetically accessible invertebrate model systems, such as fruit flies or nematodes, as these are not only powerful but also affordable and easy to maintain. For the same reasons, where vertebrates are used, we aim to promote the use of small and comparatively cost-effective models (e.g., zebrafish or medaka). We also encourage the use of local resources, such as investigations on local animal and plant species. Altogether, these measures increase the chances that students can meaningfully implement what they have learned once they return to their home institutions. Global exchange of information is key to scientific progress, but interactions between African researchers remain sparse, both within Africa and beyond (Maina et al., 2020Maina M.B. Ahmad U. Ibrahim H.A. Hamidu S.K. Nasr F.E. Salihu A.T. Abushouk A.I. Abdurrazak M. Awadelkareem M.A. Amin A. et al.20 years of African Neuroscience: Waking a sleeping giant.BioRxiv. 2020; (2020.06.03.131391)Google Scholar). Several initiatives are aimed at reducing this gap. Although targeted courses like those mentioned above can go a long way in fostering important international links, they can be expensive and difficult to scale to the required levels. Therefore, we complement our courses with a volunteering program (Figure 1G). Scientist-volunteers from around the world register interest to organize on-site training or provide focused advice in their specific area of expertise. From here, our African partners periodically receive a curated list of available volunteers and can submit specific requests based on their local needs. Once mutual interest is established, details for the visit are discussed directly between the volunteer and the hosting institution, with guidance from TReND members as required. In some cases, limited funding might be available, for example, when volunteers are based at institutions that offer scholarships toward this program (e.g., the Francis Crick Institute or the Max Planck Society). In other cases, costs can be flexibly shared between the volunteer and the host institution. This program enables personal international collaborations to form and is both nimbler and more scalable than the abovementioned research courses. Another model taken by many organizations is to provide fellowships for African scientists to spend time at western institutions, such as the Crick Africa Network, the Graduate Programme for Science and Development (PGCD) of the Gulbenkian Institute in Portugal, or the Spanish Women for Africa Foundation. Like our volunteering program, these initiatives can go a long way in developing personal links among researchers worldwide. Although the most popular approach to scientific exchange might be through conferences, these have largely remained geographically segregated. For example, the meetings of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) in the USA or of the FENS both attract impressive international crowds, but typically few participants are African-based. In contrast, the meeting of the Society of African Neuroscientists (SONA) concentrates an impressive line-up of African labs but attracts comparatively few non-African scientists. TReND aims to link societies such as SONA and FENS to increase international representation at these meetings, for instance through travel-fellowships. Eventually, transforming neuroscience conferences into a mix of in-person and online forums promises to go a long way in making these events more globally accessible. The current situation generated by COVID-19 has shown us that online meetings are not only possible but also effective. In response, the FENS 2020 conference has gone online, and worldwide participation will be facilitated through the provision of large numbers of fee-waiver scholarships. Other conferences, such as the Genetics Society of America (GSA) 2020, have waived fees altogether. In parallel, many online seminar series are springing out of the ground. Community-generated online conferences like https://neuromatch.io or seminar platforms like https://www.worldwideneuro.com (WWN) (Bozelos and Vogels, 2020Bozelos P.A. Vogels T.P. Making (neuro)science accessible world-wide: Online seminars for the globe.eLife. 2020; https://elifesciences.org/labs/d8f1d697/making-neuro-science-accessible-world-wide-online-seminars-for-the-globeGoogle Scholar) rapidly emerged, routinely attracting thousands of hits worldwide, including a growing African participation. In fact, SONA joined WWN early on, hosting both African and non-African speakers. Indeed, some African scientists have been hosting online talks long before COVID-19 hit the world stage. To facilitate these efforts, TReND has worked with the Sudanese Researchers Foundation (SRF) since 2016 and with SONA since 2019. Going forward, it will be important to continue providing broad online access to conference talks in the future. It might be as simple as online streaming departmental seminars or international conferences, with one person on-site curating questions and comments for the speaker. Ultimately, a strong African research sector can only emerge from within, supported by scientifically engaged governments and a general public that supports research and development (R&D) spending. Accordingly, promoting scientific literacy and evidence-based thinking is pivotal. To this end, TReND runs a sizable outreach and policy engagement program broadly focused on school children and the general public, including decision makers. This branch of TReND is African led and to a large extent comprised of our course alumni (Figure 1H). These African-based TReND members form a tight, pan-African community of scientists that continue to engage with each other long after courses are finished. Importantly, while engaging in outreach activities, they can serve as believable role models and can communicate in local languages if needed. To date, TReND has run several dozens of targeted outreach activities (Figure 1A), engaging with schools, universities, and the general public through a variety of formats. Activities can range from school visits for an afternoon via organized hands-on experiments for children to multi-day science festivals that involve schools, parents, teachers, and local government representatives. Many outreach events are coordinated with equipment and reagent donations, for example, by providing light-microscopes to primary schools where outreach activities are held. These activities are supported by a wide range of funders (see Acknowledgments). Moreover, since they are always organized by researchers who understand the local realities of their community, including local prices, they can achieve great impact with minimal funding. Africa’s scientific landscape is extremely heterogeneous, including both world-leading research centers and institutes of higher education where local circumstances make research all but impossible. Accordingly, the promotion of science education and research requires strategies that are adapted to local realities: a “think globally, act locally” approach. The Sustainable Development Goals 4 (SDG4) of the 2030 agenda focuses on high quality education and has two central pillars, which focus on improving learning outcomes and including those who are excluded. Across the continent, there are many organizations engaged in the promotion of research, science education, and policy (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organizations_engaged_in_STEM_education_across_Africa). Many organizations focus on specific geographical regions, fields of science, or types of support. Jointly, these grassroots organizations are key players in making inroads in the long run. They tend to be cost effective and highly sensitive to local realities, which are difficult to accurately judge for major funders. Accordingly, the most impactful initiatives are likely to be those that intimately involve African-based researchers. As part of this, it will be critical to support them to facilitate engagement with the global scientific community. Only in this way can they gain the visibility and support for leading the way in Africa’s scientific future."
https://openalex.org/W3045317802,"Medical data are often tricky to get mined for patterns even by the generally demonstrated successful modern methodologies of deep learning. This paper puts forward such a medical classification task, where patient registers of two of the categories are sometimes hard to be distinguished because of samples showing characteristics of both labels in turn in several repetitions of the screening procedure. To this end, the current research appoints a pre-processing clustering step (through self-organizing maps) to group the data based on shape similarity and relabel it accordingly. Subsequently, a deep learning approach (a tandem of convolutional and long short-term memory networks) performs the training classification phase on the 'cleaned' samples. The dual methodology was applied for the computational diagnosis of electrooculography tests within spino-cerebral ataxia of type 2. The accuracy obtained for the discrimination into three classes was of 78.24%. The improvement that this duo brings over the deep learner alone does not stem from significantly higher accuracy results when the performance is considered for all classes. The major finding of this combination is that half of the presymptomatic cases were correctly found, in opposition to the single deep model, where this category was sacrificed by the learner in favor of a good accuracy overall. A high accuracy in general is desirable for any medical task, however the correct identification of cases before the symptoms become evident is more important."
https://openalex.org/W3043874611,"Background:
Naturally occurring human genetic variants provide a valuable tool to identify drug targets and guide drug prioritization and clinical trial design. Ivabradine is a heart rate lowering drug with protective effects on heart failure despite increasing the risk of atrial fibrillation. In patients with coronary artery disease without heart failure, the drug does not protect against major cardiovascular adverse events prompting questions about the ability of genetics to have predicted those effects. This study evaluates the effect of a variant in HCN4, ivabradine’s drug target, on safety and efficacy endpoints.

Methods:
We used genetic association testing and Mendelian randomization to predict the effect of ivabradine and heart rate lowering on cardiovascular outcomes.

Results:
Using data from the UK Biobank and large GWAS consortia, we evaluated the effect of a heart rate-reducing genetic variant at the HCN4 locus encoding ivabradine’s drug target. These genetic association analyses showed increases in risk for atrial fibrillation (OR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06–1.13, P = 9.3 ×10−9) in the UK Biobank. In a cause-specific competing risk model to account for the increased risk of atrial fibrillation, the HCN4 variant reduced incident heart failure in participants that did not develop atrial fibrillation (HR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83–0.98, P = 0.013). In contrast, the same heart rate reducing HCN4 variant did not prevent a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death (OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.93–1.04, P = 0.61).

Conclusion:
Genetic modelling of ivabradine recapitulates its benefits in heart failure, promotion of atrial fibrillation, and neutral effect on myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W3044612505,"With the advent of effective treatment, women living with HIV can plan for pregnancy while minimizing risk of transmission to infants and seronegative partners. Family planning (FP) services tend to focus solely on addressing contraceptive need, but HIV-positive women-including female sex workers-often plan to have children someday. Various ""safer conception"" strategies are now available to support women living with HIV achieve fertility intentions, and integrated HIV/FP services may be a promising platform to offer these services.At integrated community-based HIV/FP service delivery sites operated by Jhpiego's Sauti project in Dar es Salaam, we conducted exit interviews with 300 HIV-positive female sex workers. Descriptive analyses were conducted to describe their desire for children, use of condoms and other modern contraceptive methods, self-reported viral suppression, and knowledge of and interest in safer conception strategies. We conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine correlates of fertility desire among respondents.Median age of participants was 32. Nearly one-third wished to have a child within two years. Seventy-two percent had heard of having the HIV-positive partner taking ART to reduce sexual transmission during pregnancy attempts. Thirty-one percent felt the amount of FP content covered in the consultation was ""too little."" Factors significantly associated with desire for children were having a nonpaying partner (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.13-4.20) and having fewer children (AOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.87). Viral suppression was not associated with fertility desire.Sex workers living with HIV attending integrated HIV/FP services have need for both contraception as well as safer conception counseling. This integrated service delivery modality is a promising platform for providing safer conception services. FP counseling for HIV-positive women should be broadened to broach the topic of safer pregnancy, as well as explicit counseling on strategies to minimize risk of sexual transmission to partners."
https://openalex.org/W3045092812,"Interrogative suggestibility, as measured with Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scales, consists of an individual's tendency to yield to misleading questions (Yield) and to change answers after negative feedback (Shift). This study aimed to determine whether reinforced self-affirmation (RSA), a technique that aims to boost self-confidence in order to increase the tendency to rely on one’s own memory instead of external cues, can reduce interrogative suggestibility. RSA consists of self-affirmation induced by means of writing down one’s greatest achievements in life and of manipulated positive feedback. The efficacy of two kinds of positive feedback was explored. Shift was reduced by positive feedback relating both to memory and to the feeling that a person is very independent in their judgements, while only feedback related to memory reduced Yield. The results are discussed in terms of the different mechanisms underlying Yield and Shift. Inducing independence of judgements might not have been effective in the case of Yield because to some extent it taps opinions but not the quality of a cognitive process such as memory. An individual may believe in their own opinions and views but still be unsure about the quality of their own memory."
