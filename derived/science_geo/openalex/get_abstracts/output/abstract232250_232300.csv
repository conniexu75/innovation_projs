https://openalex.org/W2027440363,"Plants contain three thioredoxin systems. Chloroplast thioredoxins are reduced by ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase, whereas the cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxins are reduced by NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTR). There is high similarity among NTRs from plants, lower eukaryotes, and bacteria, which are different from mammal NTR. Here we describe the OsNTRC gene from rice encoding a novel NTR with a thioredoxin-like domain at the C terminus, hence, a putative NTR/thioredoxin system in a single polypeptide. Orthologous genes were found in other plants and cyanobacteria, but not in bacteria, yeast, or mammals. Full-length OsNTRC and constructs with truncated NTR and thioredoxin domains were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged polypeptides, and a polyclonal antibody specifically cross-reacting with the OsNTRC enzyme was raised. An in vitro activity assay showed that OsNTRC is a bifunctional enzyme with both NTR and thioredoxin activity but is not an NTR/thioredoxin system. Although the OsNTRC gene was expressed in roots and shoots of rice seedlings, the protein was exclusively found in shoots and mature leaves. Moreover, fractionation experiments showed that OsNTRC is localized to the chloroplast. An Arabidopsis NTRC knock-out mutant showed growth inhibition and hypersensitivity to methyl viologen, drought, and salt stress. These results suggest that the NTRC gene is involved in plant protection against oxidative stress. Plants contain three thioredoxin systems.

Thioredoxins are small 12–13-kDa proteins with a redox-active disulfide bridge and are widely distributed in all types of organisms (1Schürmann P. Jacquot J.-P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Because of their disulfide/dithiol interchange activity, thioredoxins interact with target proteins and are involved in the regulation of a large number of cellular processes (2Balmer Y. Buchanan B.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 191-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Plants contain more types of thioredoxin systems than any other organism. The cytosolic system in plants is composed of type h thioredoxins reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed by NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTR) 1The abbreviations used are: NTR, NADPH thioredoxin reductase; OsNTR, Oryza sativa NTR; AtNTR, Arabidopsis thaliana NTR; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Trx, thioredoxin.

In addition, plants contain other thioredoxin systems localized in organelles. In chloroplasts, the thioredoxin system includes type f, m, and x thioredoxins (3Collin V. Issakidis-Bourguet E.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The plant mitochondrial system is formed by a novel type of thioredoxin (type o), which is reduced by an NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase similar to the cytosolic enzyme (9Laloi C. Rayapuram N.

Although NTR is universally distributed from bacteria to mammals, two forms of this enzyme have evolved (13Williams C.H. Arscott L.D. Muller S. Lennon B.W. Ludwig M.L. Wang P.-F. Veine D.M. Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Eur. J.

J. 2002; 217: 392-399Google Scholar), and (ii) the mammalian NTR, which is also homodimer formed by subunits of 55 kDa with an unusual selenocysteine as the penultimate residue at the C terminus (17Gladishev V.N. Jeang K.T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the recently sequenced rice genome, we have identified the OsNTRC gene encoding a novel NTR with an extension at the C terminus containing a putative thioredoxin active site. In this paper we report on the cloning of this gene, its expression in Escherichia coli, and the biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant protein as well as truncated polypeptides containing the NTR and Trx domains of the enzyme, showing that it is a bifunctional enzyme with both NTR and thioredoxin activity but not an NTR/thioredoxin system when assayed with insulin as the substrate. Surprisingly, this novel NTR is localized in chloroplasts and, to our knowledge, is the first description of a chloroplast-localized NTR. The identification and characterization of an NTRC knock-out mutant of Arabidopsis suggest that this novel NTR is involved in protection against oxidative stress. Plant Material—Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare) grains were sterilized and germinated at 25 °C on filter paper soaked with water. Chloroplasts were isolated as described in (18Price C.A. Hadjeb N. Newman L. Reardon E.M. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 1-15Crossref Google Scholar) from rice leaves of 36-day-old plants. Arabidopsis wild-type and the T-DNA insertion mutant SALK_012208 (19Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C.

Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The T-DNA homozygous line was selected after PCR analysis with oligonucleotides in the T-DNA (5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′) and the AtNTRC gene (5′-TCACCAACATGTGGCCC-3′ and 5′-TCGGGTGTGAAGATGAAGAA-3′). Isolation of OsNTRC cDNA—Total RNA (1 μg) from 5-day-old rice seedling shoots was reverse transcribed in the presence of oligo(dT) and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). An aliquot (1 μl) was used as the template in a PCR reaction with the oligonucleotides 5′-CCATCCTCTCCCTCTCCTCT-3′ and 5′-GGTGTCAAGACAACGACCAA-3′. A 1.5-kb fragment was obtained, cloned in a pGEMt vector (Promega), and sequenced in both strands. The OsNTRC gene sequence was deposited at the EMBL data bank with accession number AJ582621. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins and the Production of Anti-OsNTRC Polyclonal Antibodies—Rice OsNTRC was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged polypeptide. The coding sequence, excluding the putative signal peptide (36 residues at the N terminus, Fig. 1) was amplified from the full-length cDNA with the oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAGAGCTCGATCTTGGCAAGGGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGAAAGCTTTCATTTGTTTGACTCG-3′, which added a SacI site at the 5′-end and a HindIII site at the 3′-end (underlined). The PCR fragment was digested with SacI and HindIII, subcloned into the pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen), and introduced into E. coli XL1-Blue. The NTR domain of OsNTRC (residues 37 to 359, Fig. 1), was amplified with the oligonucleotides 5′-GAGAGAGCTCGATCTTGGCAAGGGAG-3′) and (5′-GAGAAAGCTTTTCAACAAGAAGGTCG-3′). The thioredoxin domain (residues 360 to 488, Fig. 1), was amplified with oligonucleotides (5′-GAGAGAGCTCCACCAGCCTGTTCGCG-3′) and (5′-GAGAAAGCTTTCATTTGTTTGACTCG-3′). Both of these truncated proteins were produced in E. coli as described for full-length OsNTRC. Overexpressed proteins were purified by Cu2+ affinity chromatography in pre-packed Hi-Trap affinity columns (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-OsNTRC antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with purified His-tagged Trx-D at the Service for Animal Production (University of Seville, Spain). Relative Reverse Transcription PCR, Western Blot Analysis, and Activity Assays—Reverse transcription PCR analysis was performed as described previously (20Sánchez R. Cejudo F.J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with pairs of gene-specific oligonucleotides for OsNTRC (5′-CATGTGGTCCTTGCAGAAC-3′ and 5′-AATAGGAGCGACCGGCTAAT-3′) and OsNTRB (5′-TCCAAGATCATGCAGGCC-3′ and 5′-ACGCTGGTGGTCGCTTCCTC-3′). Western-blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 217: 392-399Google Scholar). NTR activity was determined by the reduction of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) according to the method described (21Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin activity was determined with the insulin reduction assay (22Serrato A.J. Crespo J.L. Florencio F.J. Cejudo F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A Gene Encoding a Novel NTR from Rice—A search of the rice genome data base identified three putative NTR encoding genes, here called OsNTRA, OsNTRB, and OsNTRC. According to the sequence comparison shown in Fig. 1, OsNTRB is an ortholog of AtNTRB (66.7% identity), the cytosolic form of the enzyme (14Jacquot J.-P. Rivera-Madrid R. Marinho P. Kollavora M. LeMarechal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), whereas OsNTRA is the ortholog of AtNTRA (66.5% identity), the mitochondrial form of NTR (9Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y. Grienenberger J.-N. Bonnard G. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14144-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The OsNTRC and AtNTRC (72.4% identity) genes encode a novel NTR not yet described. A full OsNTRC cDNA was cloned from rice that encodes a polypeptide composed of a domain showing high similarity to other plant NTRs (Fig. 1). This domain contains the FAD binding site (motifs GXGXX(G/A) and TXXXX-VFAAGD; Fig. 1, inverted triangles), the active site (Fig. 1, asterisks), and the NADPH binding motif GXGXXA (Fig. 1, triangles). Unlike the other NTRs described to date, OsNTRC (and AtNTRC) contain an extension at the C terminus with the sequence CGPC (Fig. 1, box), a putative thioredoxin active site. These data suggest that OsNTRC encodes an NTR/thioredoxin system in a single polypeptide. This unusual type of NTR was found in cyanobacteria, and the Nostoc sp. PCC7120 gene (60.1% identity with OsNTRC) is included in Fig. 1 but not in other bacteria, fungi, or mammals. To establish the phylogeny of this novel NTR, a phylogenetic tree was constructed (Fig. 2). OsNTRC and AtNTRC genes are clustered with NTRs from cyanobacteria defining a novel group of NTRs (Fig. 2). Functional Characterization of the OsNTRC Polypeptide—To analyze the biochemical properties of the polypeptide encoded by OsNTRC gene, it was expressed in E. coli without the 36 amino acids at the N terminus (Fig. 3A). Truncated polypeptides containing the NTR- or Trx-like domains of OsNTRC were also produced (Fig. 3A) and purified by Cu2+ chromatography (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–4). For comparison, purified His-tagged NTRB (16Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 217: 392-399Google Scholar), the cytosolic form, and TRXhA (22Serrato A.J. Crespo J.L. Florencio F.J. Cejudo F.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) from wheat were also included (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 5, respectively). Western blots of the gel shown in Fig. 3B were probed with anti-NTRB antibodies (16Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 217: 392-399Google Scholar), which detected NTR-D (Fig. 3C, lane 3) more efficiently than the full-length OsNTRC (Fig. 3C, lane 2). To obtain polyclonal antibodies specifically cross-reacting with OsNTRC, rabbits were immunized with the purified Trx-D polypeptide found only in OsNTRC. As expected, this antibody specifically cross-reacted with Trx-D (Fig. 3D, lane 4) and OsNTRC (Fig. 3D, lane 2). Furthermore, an antibody against wheat thioredoxin h did not cross-react with either Trx-D or OsNTRC (Fig. 3E). Because OsNTRC contains both NTR and Trx-like domains, we tested whether this single polypeptide functions as an NTR/thioredoxin system. OsNTRC catalyzes the dithiothreitol-dependent reduction of insulin, but no activity was detected in the presence of NADPH (Fig. 4A). The thioredoxin activity of OsNTRC was due to the Trx-like domain as shown by the insulin reduction activity of the isolated Trx-D polypeptide (Fig. 4B). Both OsNTRC and the NTR domain showed NADPH-dependent reduction of DTNB (Fig. 4C). The Trx-like domain does not affect the NTR activity of OsNTRC (Fig. 4C) and, as expected, did not show any NTR activity. These results show that OsNTRC is a bifunctional enzyme, showing NTR and Trx activity, but it is not an NTR/thioredoxin system when assayed with insulin as the substrate. As for other NTRs, OsNTRC showed higher affinity for NADPH (Km of 10.4 μm) than for NADH (Km of 1.2 mm). We also tested whether the OsNTRC polypeptide was able to transfer electrons to the Trx-like module, Trx-D, to wheat TRXhA or to thioredoxins f and m from pea. None of them were substrates for OsNTRC (results not shown). Expression Pattern of the OsNTRC Gene—Relative quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to analyze the expression of OsNTRC and cytosolic OsNTRB in 4–7-day-old rice seedlings. OsNTRC and OsNTRB transcripts accumulated at similar amount in roots and shoots (Fig. 5A). A similar and invariable amount of the OsNTRB polypeptide was detected in both organs (Fig. 5B) in agreement with the presence of OsNTRB transcripts. Surprisingly, the OsNTRC polypeptide was detected exclusively in shoots (Fig. 5B), showing that NTRC is absent or of low abundance in roots despite the presence of OsNTRC transcripts in this organ. The fact that the OsNTRC gene is exclusive to oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, along with the presence of the OsNTRC polypeptide in green tissues, suggested its chloroplast localization. To test this possibility, we performed fractionation experiments using chloroplasts purified from rice leaves. Western blot analysis showed that NTRC was more abundant in the chloroplast stroma, although it was also detected in the thylakoid fraction (Fig. 5C). Both the stroma and the thylakoid fractions were free of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial contamination as shown by the lack of signal when Western blots were probed with the anti-NTRB antibody (Fig. 5C). Characterization of an Arabidopsis NTRC Knock-out Mutant—A T-DNA insertion line of the Arabidopsis NTRC gene was identified in the SALK collection (19Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N. Deen H. Geralt M. Hazari N. Hom E. Karnes M. Mulholland C. Ndubaku R. Schmidt I. Guzman P. Aguilar-Henonin L. Schmid M. Weigel D. Carter D.E. Marchand T. Risseeuw E. Brogden D. Zeko A. Crosby W.L. Berry C.C. Ecker J.R. Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). PCR-based genotyping identified both heterozygous and homozygous lines for the T-DNA (Fig. 6A), and the homozygous line was further characterized. For unknown reasons, the anti-NTRC antibody detected the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) large subunit from Arabidopsis (Fig. 6B, L). Nevertheless, the Western blot showed the absence of NTRC in the mutant (Fig. 6B), whereas it contained wild-type amounts of NTRB (Fig. 6B). As in rice seedlings, NTRC was not detected in roots (Fig. 6B, R), showing that it is either absent or present in very low amounts in roots. Seeds of the Arabidopsis NTRC knock-out mutant germinated as efficiently as wild-type seeds, but mutant plants showed smaller rosette leaves with a pale green color (Fig. 6C) and clear growth inhibition, which were evident early after flowering (Fig. 6D) and in adult plants (Fig. 6E). This phenotype suggested that standard growth conditions caused stress to the NTRC-deficient mutant. Because NTRC polypeptide is localized in the chloroplast, this effect might be related to chloroplast protection against oxidative damage. To test this possibility, 29-day-old wild-type and mutant plants were sprayed with methyl viologen, a photo-oxidizing agent that causes oxidative stress (26Babbs C.F. Pham J.A. Coolbaugh R.C. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 1267-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NTRC-deficient plants showed a much higher sensitivity to methyl viologen than did wild-type plants (Fig. 6F), as well as more symptoms of leaf senescence (Fig. 6F, arrow). Because other environmental stresses cause oxidative damage, we tested the sensitivity of the NTRC mutant to salt (Fig. 6G) and drought (Fig. 6H) stress. Again, the effect of both stresses was more severe in the mutant than in wild-type plants. For comparison, untreated wild-type and mutant plants are also shown (Fig. 6I). In this paper we describe a gene from rice and Arabidopsis encoding a novel NTR that is found exclusively in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. In addition to sequence similarity data, several lines of evidence show that OsNTRC encodes an NTR. The deduced protein, expressed in E. coli, is a flavoenzyme (results not shown) detected by a polyclonal antibody against the cytosolic form of the NTRB enzyme from wheat (16Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 217: 392-399Google Scholar) and shows NADPH-dependent DTNB reduction activity (Fig. 4A). The Km of the enzyme for NADPH (10.4 μm) is in the range of values reported for NTRs from different plant sources (14Jacquot J.-P. Rivera-Madrid R. Marinho P. Kollavora M. LeMarechal P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1357-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Serrato A.J. Pérez-Ruiz J.M. Cejudo F.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 217: 392-399Google Scholar) and, as for other NTRs described to date, it shows a higher affinity for NADPH than for NADH. However, OsNTRC is an unusual NTR due to the presence of a Trx-like domain at the C terminus, which raises the possibility that this enzyme might function as an NTR/thioredoxin system. We demonstrate that OsNTRC shows both NTR and thioredoxin activity due to the NTR and Trx-like domains of the protein; however, OsNTRC was unable to catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of insulin. Therefore, we conclude that OsNTRC is a bifunctional enzyme and not an NTR/thioredoxin system, at least under these assay conditions. Our data show that OsNTRC or the truncated polypeptide containing the NTR domain was unable to transfer electrons to the thioredoxin-like domain of the protein. Furthermore, it was not able to reduce wheat TRXhA, E. coli thioredoxin, and thioredoxins f and m from pea. Therefore, despite the clear features summarized above indicating that the OsNTRC gene encodes an NTR, none of the plant thioredoxins analyzed are substrates for this enzyme. According to accessible databases, this novel NTR seems to be exclusive to plants and cyanobacteria. Our phylogenetic analysis shows a close relationship of OsNTRC and AtNTRC with the cyanobacterial NTR genes. The only example of a hybrid protein with NTR and thioredoxin domains was identified in Mycobacterium leprae (27Wieles B. Soolingen D. Holmgren A. Offringa R. Ottenhoff T. Thole J.E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and, surprisingly, this gene is grouped with the bacterial NTRs and not with NTRC genes (Fig. 2). This Mycobacterium gene seems exceptional, because other mycobacterial strains contain separate genes for NTR and Trx (27Wieles B. Soolingen D. Holmgren A. Offringa R. Ottenhoff T. Thole J.E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast with the rice OsNTRC protein, the hybrid mycobacterial protein functions as an NTR/thioredoxin system (28Wieles B. van Noort J. Drijfhout J.W. Offringa R. Holmgren A. Ottenhoff T.H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25604-25606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The analysis of the expression pattern of the OsNTRC gene revealed an unexpected result. The OsNTRC gene was expressed in roots and shoots from rice seedlings (Fig. 5A); however, the OsNTRC polypeptide was predominantly detected in photosynthetic tissues in both rice and Arabidopsis (Figs. 5B and 6B). Indeed, this polypeptide was localized in the chloroplast stroma and, to a lower level, in the thylakoid fraction (Fig. 5C). This finding implies that the extension of the protein at the N terminus might function as a chloroplast-targeting peptide. Available prediction programs failed to identify this sequence as a chloroplast-targeting signal, but prediction is not always reliable based only on sequence (29Mestres-Ortega D. Meyer Y. Gene. 1999; 240: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The absence or low abundance of OsNTRC in roots, despite the presence of the corresponding transcripts, suggests that either the transcript is not efficiently translated or that the protein is unstable; but the actual reason for the lack of detection of protein in nonphotosynthetic tissues is not yet understood. The predominant localization of this novel NTR in the chloroplast stroma and its high affinity for NADPH suggests that it may be involved in the use of reducing power from photosynthetic electron transport. Because the chloroplast thioredoxins involved in carbon assimilation are not substrates for NTRC, the possibility that NTRC is involved in redox control of Calvin cycle enzymes may be ruled out. Another likely possibility is that this NTR is involved in transferring reducing power for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage. The deficiency of NTRC in Arabidopsis is not lethal but causes severe growth inhibition (Fig. 6). The pale green color of the mutant rosette leaves and their smaller size, as well as their hypersensitivity to treatments provoking oxidative stress, lends support to a role of NTRC in chloroplast protection against oxidative damage. Several components of the system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage have been identified, such as the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1 (30Baier M. Dietz K.-J.

N., Accili, D., Ferrans, V. J., Yu, Z. X., Takeda, K., Grinberg, A., Westphal, H., Preston, Y. A., and Adelstein, R. S. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 12407–12412). Here we show that mice ablated for NMHC II-A fail to develop a normal patterned embryo with a polarized visceral endoderm by E6.5 and die by E7.5. Moreover, A–/A– embryoid bodies grown in suspension culture constantly shed cells. These defects in cell adhesion and tissue organization are explained by loss of E-cadherin and β-catenin localization to cell adhesion sites in both cell culture and in the intact embryos. The defects can be reproduced by introducing siRNA directed against NMHC II-A into wild-type embryonic stem cells. Our results suggest an essential role for a single, specific nonmuscle myosin isoform in maintaining cell-cell adhesions in the early mammalian embryo.

While the human genes are referred to as MYH9, MYH10, and MYH14, the protein products are commonly referred to as nonmuscle myosin II-A, II-B, and II-C, deriving their names from the relevant NMHC. Ablation and mutation of NMHC II-B results in major structural abnormalities in the heart including a ventricular septal defect, mislocation of the aorta (16Tullio A.N. Accili D. Ferrans V.J. Yu Z.X.

Res. 2003; 93: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Brain defects include the abnormal migration of specific groups of neurons and a severe hydrocephalus (5Ma X. Kawamoto S. Hara Y. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2568-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Until now, the effects of ablating NMHC II-A have not been reported, although humans with a single amino acid mutation have been shown to manifest a number of abnormalities affecting the kidneys, platelets, lens, and inner ear (6Martignetti J. Haematologica. 2002; 87: 897-898PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we address the role of NMHC II-A during early mouse development and show that it plays an important role in cell-cell adhesion and the formation of a polarized visceral endoderm. The following experimental procedures are described in the supplemental material: generation of A–/A– mice, RNA analysis and immunoblotting, embryo dissection and immunohistochemistry, TUNEL and BrdUrd assays, real-time PCR, and the antibodies used in immunoblot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. RT-PCR—cDNA was synthesized from RNA made from wild-type, A+/A–, and A–/A– embryoid bodies using the Superscript I kit (Invitrogen) with 5 μg of RNA and random hexamer primers. Dilutions of cDNA from 1:20 to 1:80 were then amplified with specific primers (7Duncan S.A. Nagy A. Chan W. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 279-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation and Plating of ES Colonies—ES cells (5 × 104) were plated on sterile glass coverslips in 15% ES cell-qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) DMEM supplemented with LIF (103 units/ml, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and cultured for 2 days in a 10% CO2 incubator to form colonies. Colonies were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 5% sucrose in PBS, rinsed with PBS, and treated with M.O.M. blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Preparation of Embryoid Bodies and Time-lapse Microscopy—Embryoid bodies were formed from either A–/A–, A+/A–, or wild-type ES cells and cultured according to Robertson (8Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 71-112Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 104 cells) were cultured in DMEM + 10% ES cell-qualified FBS (Invitrogen) without LIF for 48 h on bacteriological nonadhesive plates. The embryoid bodies were collected, washed, and transferred to a regular tissue culture dish for 2 h prior to filming, and phase contrast (Zeiss Axiovert 25, Jena, Germany) time-lapse images were captured every 10 min for 20–24 h using MetaMorph 6.12 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). siRNA Electroporation into ES Cells—A pool of siRNAs (25 pmol) specific for mouse NMHC II-A (SMARTpool, Dharmacon Research, Inc., Lafayette, CO) was electroporated into ES cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector instrument and program A23 (Amaxa Biosystems, Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were plated in 12-well plates for immunoblot analysis and in 6-well plates on 20-mm coverslips for immunofluorescence analysis. The vector pCX-EGFP (a gift of Andras Nagy, Toronto, Canada) was used as a control for electroporation efficiency (90%). Cells were cultured for 24–72 h prior to analysis. The NMHC II-A gene was disrupted by homologous recombination using the strategy shown in supplemental Fig. S1 to generate heterozygous mice (see Fig. 1A, lanes 5–7). To generate A–/A– ES cells that would be useful for cell and developmental studies, one of the heterozygous ES cell clones was re-electroporated with the original construct and selected at 2.5 mg/ml G418. Southern blot analysis of A–/A– ES cell clones is shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4. Analysis of RNA from A+/A– and A–/A– ES cells identifies a band at the expected size (7.2 kb) for the NMHC messenger RNA in the A+/A– cells. No NMHC II-A mRNA is detected in the A–/A– ES cells (Fig. 1B). Incubation of immunoblots of ES cell extracts with antibodies to NMHC II-A detected the heavy chain (200 kDa) in wild-type and A+/A– ES cells, but no protein was detected in the A–/A– ES cells. Cells of all three genotypes express NMHC II-B at approximately the same level, but none of the ES cell genotypes expresses NMHC II-C (Fig. 1C). Heterozygous mice were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Because no A–/A– mice were born, embryos were dissected at various stages of development to determine at what stage the null mutation became lethal. No viable A–/A– embryos were found later than E7.5. In an effort to gain insight into the cause of the early lethality, we analyzed sections of mouse embryos between E5.5 and E7.5 for cell proliferation using BrdUrd staining and for apoptosis using TUNEL assays. There was no significant difference between normal and null embryos in either assay (see supplemental Fig. S2). Fig. 2A shows the results of immunostaining normal and mutant embryos at E6.5 with antibodies raised to NMHC II-A and II-B, and Fig. 2B shows staining by antibodies to the transcription factor GATA-4. In normal embryos (Fig. 2A, panels d–f), antibody staining for NMHC II-A is found in all cell layers (Fig. 2A, panel e). A–/A– embryos were identified by a lack of staining with the NMHC II-A antibody and marked cellular disorganization (Fig. 2A, panels a and b). Staining with an antibody to NMHC II-C confirmed its absence at E6.5 (data not shown). It is of particular note that, although both the null and normal embryos stain with an antibody for NMHC II-B (Fig. 2A, panels c and f), this staining is absent or very low in the outer cell layer of the normal embryo, the visceral endoderm (Fig. 2A, panel f, bracket). Moreover, the shape of the cells forming the visceral endoderm differs markedly between normal and A–/A– mice, with development of a polarized columnar morphology in the former by E6.5 (Fig. 2A, panels d and e, bracket, enlarged in inset), while a cuboidal shape is retained in the case of A–/A– mice (Fig. 2A, panel a, and Fig. 2B, panel a, arrows). To identify cells of the visceral endoderm in the A–/A– mice, we stained E6.5 embryos with antibodies to GATA-4, a marker that is expressed in normal visceral endoderm at this stage. The presence of positively staining cells clearly defining the visceral endoderm is seen in the normal embryo (Fig. 2B, panel b, bracket). Although GATA-4 is present in the A–/A– embryo, the abnormal cell morphology and disarray of the visceral endoderm as indicated by GATA-4 staining of the A–/A– embryo is apparent (Fig. 2B, panel a, arrows). To further characterize the expression of markers of visceral endoderm development, we used ES cells cultured under conditions in which they aggregate to form embryoid bodies. As such, they maintain temporal and spatial relationships in vitro of certain marker proteins expressed in embryos in vivo. Fig. 3A shows RT-PCR analyses of 14-day-old wild-type, A+/A– and A–/A– embryoid bodies for the indicated markers. GATA-4 and apo-E, markers for specification of the visceral endoderm, were positive in all three genotypes of embryoid bodies. However, some markers for proteins that are secreted from the visceral endoderm and that indicate maturation and function of the visceral endoderm were missing, apo-AI, or markedly decreased, AFP (α-fetoprotein), TTR (transthyretin), apo-B, and RBP (retinal-binding protein) in the A–/A– embryoid bodies (Fig. 3A). These results were also confirmed for five of the markers (GATA-4, apo-E, AFP, RBP, and TTR) by real-time PCR analysis (see supplemental Fig. S3 for GATA-4 and RBP). To further characterize the A–/A– embryoid bodies, we cultured them in suspension on nonadhesive bacteriological culture plates. A marked difference between wild-type and A–/A– embryoid bodies was the continuous shedding of cells from the latter, but not the former, suggesting a defect in cell adhesion in the A–/A– embryoid bodies (Fig. 3B, panels a and b). The embryoid bodies were then transferred to regular tissue culture plates and observed by video time-lapse phase microscopy (Fig. 3B, panels c–f). Wild-type embryoid bodies retained a cohesive rounded morphology throughout the experiments (Fig. 3B, panels c and e), whereas A–/A– embryoid bodies attached to the tissue culture surface within 30 min accompanied by flattening and progressive outward migration of individual cells (Fig. 3B, panels d and f). The disrupted organization of cell layers in A–/A– embryos and the shedding of cells by A–/A– embryoid bodies in suspension and their rapid dispersal on adhesive substrates suggested that absence of NMHC II-A might cause defects in the cell complexes needed for effective cell-cell adhesion. We therefore compared the localization of NMHC II-A and the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as well as its intracellular binding partner, β-catenin, in frozen sections of A–/A– and wild-type E6.5 embryos using immunofluorescence confocal microcopy. As shown in Fig. 4a, NMHC II-A, in addition to being present in the cytoplasm, localized to the contact areas between the cells in wild-type embryos, close to E-cadherin (Fig. 4a, NMHC II-A; Fig. 4b, E-cadherin). In contrast, in A–/A– mouse embryos, E-cadherin was diminished at the cell-cell contacts (Fig. 4, compare d and b). The same decreased localization was found for β-catenin in A–/A– embryos (Fig. 4, compare h and f). These defects in the localization of molecules involved in cell adhesion were also apparent upon culturing wild-type and A–/A– ES cells on regular tissue culture substrates. A striking difference between A–/A– and wild-type ES cells cultured under these conditions was the failure of A–/A– ES cells to form a discrete colony border (Fig. 4, compare i and k with j and l). Similar to the findings in embryonic tissues, there was a marked decrease in the amounts of E-cadherin and β-catenin present in the areas of cell-cell contact in the A–/A– cells compared with the wild-type ES cells (Fig. 4, compare i with j for cadherin and k with l for β-catenin). Fig. 4m is an immunoblot showing that the content of E-cadherin and β-catenin was essentially the same in A+/A+, A+/A– and A–/A– cells and supports the idea that those proteins are mislocalized and not decreased in the A–/A– cells. To verify whether NMHC II-A is critical for the formation of other types of cell adhesions, we compared the distribution of NMHC II-A and II-B, actin, ZO-2 (a marker for tight junctions), and connexin-43 (a marker for gap junctions) in wild-type and A–/A– cultured ES cells. In wild-type colonies, similar to E6.5 embryos, NMHC II-A localized near plasma membranes and particularly to areas of cell-cell contacts (Fig. 5A, panel a), while NMHC II-B showed more pronounced circumferential staining at the external surface of colonies, with a less pronounced cell-cell border localization (Fig. 5A, panel c), NMHC II-B staining remained prominent at the external surface of the colonies, and its overall distribution was essentially unchanged in A–/A– cells, although there was a change in the rounded shape of the colonies (Fig. 5A, panel d). F-actin was localized relatively uniformly to the cell cortex near the plasma membrane in A+/A+ colonies (Fig. 5A, panel e). In A–/A– colonies, total cortical F-actin staining remained relatively high, but a reduction in F-actin staining at the external borders of the colonies was observed (Fig. 5A, panel f). As was found for E-cadherin and β-catenin, ZO-2 levels, but not connexin 43 levels, were decreased at cell-cell boundaries in A–/A– cultured ES cells (see supplemental Fig. S4). To confirm the above results, we electroporated ES cells with a pool of siRNAs specific for mouse NMHC II-A. Fig. 5B shows that, similar to the A–/A– embryos and ES cells, the siRNA-treated cells show a decrease in E-cadherin (Fig. 5B, panels c and d) and β-catenin (Fig. 5B, panels g and h) at cell-cell interfaces compared with mock-transfected cells. Immunoblot analysis confirms that the decrease in NMHC II-A in these cells is not accompanied by a decrease in E-cadherin and β-catenin content, consistent with the displacement of these proteins from the cell boundaries (Fig. 5C). In addition, the blots show that there is no change in NMHC II-B and actin. Above, we demonstrate the striking effects of nonmuscle myosin II-A ablation on early embryonic development. A–/A– embryos fail to develop past E7.5. The visceral endoderm does not mature molecularly and morphologically. The overall disarray of tissue and cellular organization could be reproduced effectively in vitro using embryoid bodies. A–/A– ES cells cannot maintain the typical compact morphology, and cells readily disperse from the embryoid bodies. We also show here that two critical cell-cell adherens junction proteins, E-cadherin and β-catenin, do not localize normally to cell-cell interfaces both in vivo and in vitro, and tight junction formation is also impaired. It is noteworthy that uvomorulin (cadherin)-deficient ES cells, similar to nonmuscle myosin II-A-deficient cells, cannot aggregate tightly (9Calogero A. Samuels M. Darland T. Edwards S.A. Kemler R. Adamson E.D. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and that β-catenin-null embryos at E7 showed detachment of cells from the ectodermal cell layer and dispersal into the proamniotic cavity (10Haegel H. Larue L. Ohsugi M. Fedorov L. Herrenknecht K. Kemler R. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 3529-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myosins I and II are the motors that generate contractility in cells. As described by Krendel and Bonder (11Krendel M.F. Bonder E.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1999; 43: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), contractility driven rearrangement of actin bundles can modulate the spatial organization of cell-cell contacts. However, even though nonmuscle myosin II-B is present in both A–/A– embryos and A–/A– ES cells, this isoform cannot rescue the mislocalization and the subsequent tissue disarray or cell shedding. Indeed, recent work from a number of laboratories (12Lo C.-M. Buxton D.B. Chua G.C.H. Dembo M. Adelstein R.S. Wang Y.-L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 13Chantler P.D. Wylie S.R. IEE Proc. Nanobiotechnol. 2003; 150: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Kolega J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4745-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) confirms that these two isoforms have different functions in the same cell and supports a role for myosin II in E-cadherin-mediated adhesions (15Avizienyte E. Fincham V.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2794-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our data suggest a unique role for myosin II-A during early embryonic development. By exerting tension on actin, which is bound to the cadherin-catenin complex, this myosin plays an essential role in maintaining normal adhesion junctions and cellular organization of the early mouse embryo.

They perform most of their functions in a GTP-bound form by interacting with specific downstream effectors. The exocyst is a complex of eight polypeptides involved in constitutive secretion and functions as an effector for multiple Ras-related small GTPases, including the Rab protein Sec4p in yeast. In this study, we have examined the localization and function of the Sec15 exocyst subunit in mammalian cells. Overexpressed Sec15 associated with clusters of tubular/vesicular elements that were concentrated in the perinuclear region. The tubular/vesicular clusters were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm upon treatment with the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole and were accessible to endocytosed transferrin, but not exocytic cargo (vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein). Consistent with these observations, Sec15 colocalized selectively with the recycling endosome marker Rab11 and exhibited a GTP-dependent interaction with the Rab11 GTPase, but not with Rab4, Rab6, or Rab7. These findings provide the first evidence that the exocyst functions as a Rab effector complex in mammalian cells. Rab/Ypt GTPases play key roles in the regulation of vesicular trafficking.

These findings provide the first evidence that the exocyst functions as a Rab effector complex in mammalian cells. Rab/Ypt proteins are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins that play key roles in the regulation of intracellular vesicular trafficking (1Schimmoller F. Simon I. Pfeffer S.R.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The Rab proteins encompass a large family of related GTPases that function predominantly in distinct trafficking pathways. The Rab functional cycle is coupled to GTP binding and hydrolysis, which are catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins, respectively. In the GTP-bound state, Rab proteins are recruited to membranes where they associate with specific downstream effector molecules that direct vesicle targeting and docking to the appropriate acceptor compartment. It is emerging that GTP-bound Rab proteins regulate a diverse array of effector molecules, including factors that promote vesicle formation, motility, docking, and fusion (3Segev N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). GTPase-activating protein-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis results in the dissociation of effector complexes and extraction of GDP-bound Rab from membranes. Rab11 is a ubiquitously expressed Rab protein that is involved in the endosomal recycling pathway in mammalian cells. It colocalizes with the transferrin receptor (TfnR) 1The abbreviations used are: TfnR, transferrin receptor; RE, recycling endosome; Tfn, transferrin; TGN, trans-Golgi network; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; hTfnR, human transferrin receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); HRP, horseradish peroxidase; VSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. on pericentriolar recycling endosomes (REs) and is involved in recycling of transferrin (Tfn) to the plasma membrane (4Ren M.

The exocyst complex (also known as the Sec6/8 complex), one of the more extensively studied Rab effectors, is composed of eight subunits (Sec3, Sec5, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells (10TerBush D.R.

Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for exocyst function in vesicle targeting in higher organisms has remained obscure. Reagents—An anti-Sec15 polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunization of rabbits with a C-terminal peptide (KDTSKKNNIFAQFRKNDRDRQKC) conjugated to diphtheria toxin. The antibody was affinity-purified from the antiserum using the same peptide immobilized on Amino Link Plus coupling gel (Pierce). Mouse anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody and LipofectAMINE transfection reagent were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) and anti-Rab11 polyclonal antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) monoclonal antibody, Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies, and Texas Red-labeled Tfn were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-Sec6 monoclonal antibody (clone 9H5) was from Stressgen Biotech Corp. (Victoria, Canada). All other reagents were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The clones encoding Sec10 and Sec15 were obtained from Dr. R. H. Scheller (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), and human TfnR (hTfnR) was from Drs. M. Silverman and G. Banker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Complementary DNAs encoding wild-type Sec15 (amino acids 2–822), Sec10 (amino acids 2–707), and TfnR were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCR-Blunt-TOPO shuttle vector (Invitrogen). The cDNA clones encoding wild-type Rab4a, Rab6a, Rab7, and Rab11a were generated by PCR from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library and subcloned into the pPCR-Script-Amp shuttle vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The Rab11 mutants Rab11(S25N) and Rab11(Q70L) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For construction of expression vectors, the cDNAs were inserted in-frame into the following plasmids: pcDNA4-HisMax-C (Invitrogen) for Xpress-tagged proteins, pEGFP-C (Clontech) for GFP fusion proteins, pEBG (14Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) for mammalian expression of GST fusion proteins, and pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) for bacterial expression of histidine-tagged Rab11 (His6-Rab11). Cell Culture, Transient Transfections, and Fluorescence Microscopy— COS-7, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CSL Biosciences, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Transfection of CHO cells was performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. For COS-7 and 293 cells, transfections were performed by electroporation. A 0.2-ml aliquot of cells in suspension was added to a 50-μl mixture containing plasmid DNA (15 μg each plasmid) in 0.15 m NaCl and electroporated at 200 V and 975 microfarads. For microscopy experiments, the cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to recover for 16–20 h at 37 °C. The transfected cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized in 100% methanol at –20 °C for 2 min. Following washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with blocking buffer (5% goat serum and 0.01% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min. Binding of primary antibodies was performed for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer at the following dilutions: anti-Xpress antibody, 1:500; and anti-Rab11 antibody, 1:20. The cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies at 1:300 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted onto glass slides. Single plane images were obtained using a Leica TCS-NT confocal microscope (×100 objective). Transferrin Uptake and Recycling Assays—COS-7 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding GFP-Sec15 and Xpress-TfnR and plated onto coverslips. Twenty hours post-transfection, the cells were washed once with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and serum-starved for 2 h by incubation at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were pulsed with Texas Red-labeled Tfn (20 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS on ice, and chased with holo-Tfn (200 μg/ml) for increasing time points. The cells were placed on ice to terminate trafficking, fixed and permeabilized as described above. Binding Assays—For in vivo binding assays, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors as indicated. Twenty hours after transfection, confluent 10-cm dishes of transfected cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates (300 μl) were incubated with 1 mm GTPγS or GDPβS for 20 min at room temperature and supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2. GST fusion proteins were recovered by incubation with 15 μl of glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C. For in vitro binding assays, purified His6-Rab proteins were preloaded with 1 mm GTPγS or GDPβS in binding buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) for 20 min at 37 °C. Detergent lysates from cells expressing GST-Sec15 were incubated with glutathione beads for 4 h at 4 °C to immobilize the GST fusion protein. The GST-Sec15 beads were washed three times with binding buffer and incubated for an additional 2 h in the same buffer supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and 0.8 μm His6-Rab11 with bound GTPγS or GDPβS. To investigate binding between endogenous Sec15 and GST-Rab11, whole rat brain tissue was washed twice with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in lysis buffer. The detergent extract was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was precleared by incubation with glutathione beads for 30 min. Immobilized GST-Rab11 or control GST was preincubated with 1 mm GTPγS or GDPβS in binding buffer for 20 min at 37 °C and washed with the same buffer. The precleared lysates were supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2 and incubated with immobilized GST proteins (0.2 μm) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 0.15 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed using anti-His (1:1000), anti-Xpress (1:5000), anti-GST (1:1000), or affinity-purified anti-Sec15 (1:500) primary antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were developed using ECL and quantitated by gel densitometry. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—The two-hybrid assay was performed as described previously (15Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding Sec15 and the Rab proteins were ligated into the vectors pEG202 (bait) and pJG4-5 (prey), respectively. Yeast strain EGY48r cells were cotransformed with the plasmids and plated onto synthetic medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and histidine. The transformed cells were subsequently plated onto medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as substrate and galactose to induce expression of the prey fusion protein. The binding affinities were quantitated in triplicate using a β-galactosidase assay. Electron Microscopy—CHO cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding GFP-Sec15 and Xpress-hTfnR. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free medium for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the medium was supplemented with 25 μg/ml human Tfn conjugated to HRP (Tfn-HRP; Rockland Inc., Gilbertsville, PA) for 30 min at 37 °C. The 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reaction was performed as described previously (16Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Following the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine reaction, the cells were placed on ice, washed three times with PBS, and fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde in 0.08 m Sörensen's buffer for 1 h at 0 °C. The fixed cells were washed twice with 0.08 m Sörensen's buffer supplemented with 5% (w/v) sucrose, scraped from the dishes, and pelleted by centrifugation. Ultrathin cryosections were prepared using a modified Tokyasu technique (17Brown D.L. Heimann K. Lock J. Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Immunolabeling of the cryosections was performed using a mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (4 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Inc.) or an equivalent concentration of a mouse anti-Aspergillus niger IgG1 isotype control monoclonal antibody (Dako Corp.), followed by 10-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:20. Localization of Overexpressed Sec15—To investigate the subcellular localization of Sec15, we initially generated an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against a Sec15 C-terminal peptide. In immunofluorescence microscopy experiments, relatively high concentrations of the antibody were required to detect a signal above background, and in undifferentiated PC12 cells, the staining was distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm with no evidence of the previously reported perinuclear enrichment (18Wang S. Hsu S.C. Hybrid Hybridomics. 2003; 22: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Based on these data, it was concluded that the anti-Sec15 peptide antibody is not suitable for immunofluorescence studies. As an alternative approach, we used confocal fluorescence microscopy to examine the localization of overexpressed Sec15 with an N-terminal Xpress epitope tag (Xpress-Sec15) or a GFP-Sec15 fusion protein in transfected cells (Fig. 1). Initial immunoblot experiments confirmed that the expression vectors directed the synthesis of Sec15 polypeptides of the appropriate molecular mass (data not shown). Strikingly, overexpression of either GFP-Sec15 or Xpress-Sec15 in COS-7 cells resulted in the formation of numerous intense dots of fluorescence that were concentrated in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, diffuse intracellular fluorescence was apparent, consistent with the existence of a cytosolic pool of the overexpressed protein. This pattern of fluorescence was observed upon transfection for time periods of 4 h up to at least 48 h. A similar localization was observed in transiently transfected CHO and 293 cells, where discrete dots of GFP-Sec15 fluorescence were detected in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1, C and D). The dots of fluorescence were not observed in cells transfected in parallel with a GFP vector control. It should be emphasized that the observed localization of Sec15 is likely to result from overexpression and may not reflect its subcellular distribution at normal expression levels. Interestingly, endogenous Sec15 has recently been demonstrated to localize to the perinuclear region in undifferentiated PC12 cells and to redistribute to the growing neurite and growth cone upon differentiation (18Wang S. Hsu S.C. Hybrid Hybridomics. 2003; 22: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Initially, we examined the effect of the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole on the localization of GFP-Sec15 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 2). The perinuclear localization of Golgi cisternae, endosomal compartments, and lysosomes is maintained by tethering to microtubules. Following nocodazole treatment (100 μm for 30 min), the dots of fluorescence became dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, whereas in control cells treated with vehicle (0.3% Me2SO), their perinuclear localization was maintained (Fig. 2). These findings suggested that the observed localization of Sec15 resulted from its association with a microtubule-tethered compartment(s) or vesicle cluster and not from nonspecific aggregation of the overexpressed protein. The observation that the dots appeared unaltered despite their redistribution within the cytoplasm also suggested that their formation did not result from a direct association of Sec15 with microtubules. Recent studies have revealed that Sec10 associates directly with Sec15 in yeast and mammalian cells (13Guo W. Roth D. Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 19Matern H.T. Yeaman C. Nelson W.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether Sec10 was recruited to the fluorescent dots formed upon overexpression of Sec15 (Fig. 3). In this experiment, COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding Xpress-Sec10 alone (Fig. 3A) or in combination with GFP-Sec15 (Fig. 3B). When expressed alone, Xpress-Sec10 exhibited diffuse cytosolic staining, consistent with previous observations (19Matern H.T. Yeaman C. Nelson W.J. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, when coexpressed with GFP-Sec15, Xpress-Sec10 exhibited a dramatic redistribution from the cytosol to the Sec15-positive structures. This observation suggests that GFP-Sec15 retains the ability to interact with Sec10 when overexpressed in mammalian cells and is therefore a functional molecule. In contrast, GFP-Sec15 did not exhibit detectable overlap with Sec6 (Fig. 3C), raising the possibility that Sec10 may be recruited to the Sec15-positive structures independently of other exocyst subunits. Since exocyst subunits have been implicated in the TGN to plasma membrane limb of the secretory pathway, it was important to establish whether the perinuclear dots of fluorescence observed upon overexpression of Sec15 represent elements of the TGN or TGN-derived vesicles. To test this, the ts045 temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) fused to GFP (20Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was utilized as an exocytic reporter. ts045-VSVG is reversibly misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) and is able to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and traffic to the plasma membrane following incubation at the permissive temperature (32 °C). However, if the cells are shifted directly from the restrictive temperature to 19 °C, ts045-VSVG is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently arrested in Golgi/TGN compartments. Therefore, cells expressing ts045-VSVG-GFP and Xpress-Sec15 were incubated at 39.5 °C for 20 h and then at 19 °C for 2 h to trap ts045-VSVG-GFP in the Golgi/TGN and examined by microscopy (Fig. 4). The ts045-VSVG-GFP fusion protein used for these studies has been shown previously to exhibit exocytic trafficking properties that are indistinguishable from those of untagged VSVG in COS cells (20Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Following temperature shift from 39.5 to 19 °C for 2 h, a patch of ts045-VSVG-GFP fluorescence was detected in COS-7 cells, characteristic of the Golgi (Fig. 4A). As expected, Xpress-Sec15 labeled punctate structures that were concentrated in the perinuclear region in cotransfected cells (Fig. 4B). Merged images (Fig. 4, C and D) revealed that there was minimal overlap between the staining patterns of ts045-VSVG-GFP and Xpress-Sec15 under these conditions. The limited overlap that was observed was most likely a consequence of close proximity of Sec15 and ts045-VSVG in the perinuclear region rather than co-association on Golgi/TGN membranes since the structures labeled by Xpress-Sec15 were clearly distinct from the single patch of fluorescence defined by ts045-VSVG. In light of previous observations concerning the localization of overexpressed Sec15p in yeast (21Salminen A. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1023-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we considered it possible that the Sec15-positive structures might represent a cluster of accumulated exocytic vesicles. To test this, transfected cells that had been held at 19 °C for 2 h were subsequently shifted to 32 °C to allow the formation of TGN-derived vesicular intermediates and transport of ts045-VSVG-GFP to the plasma membrane. We were unable to detect significant colocalization between ts045-VSVG-GFP and Xpress-Sec15 following temperature shift to 32 °C for 30 min (Fig. 4, E–H). At late time points, a rim of ts045-VSVG-GFP fluorescence around the cell surface was observed in Sec15-expressing cells, consistent with progression to the plasma membrane (data not shown). The lack of colocalization between ts045-VSVG-GFP and overexpressed Sec15 prompted us to examine whether the structures labeled by the exocyst subunit are accessible to endocytic cargo. The Tfn recycling pathway has been studied extensively in mammalian cells. Following its binding to TfnR at the cell surface, Tfn is internalized and transported through early endosomes, from where it is recycled back to the plasma membrane via the RE compartment. To investigate whether the Sec15-positive structures are accessible to internalized Tfn, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with expression vectors encoding GFP-Sec15 and hTfnR. Previous studies have established that recombinant hTfnR functions in a manner that is indistinguishable from the endogenous receptor in transfected cells (22McGraw T.E. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A pulse-chase experiment was performed in which the cotransfected cells were incubated in the presence of biotinylated Tfn for 5 min at 37 °C (pulse) and then chased with unlabeled Tfn for increasing times. The localization of GFP-Sec15 and endocytosed biotinylated Tfn was examined by microscopy (Fig. 5). When trafficking was terminated immediately following the pulse (0 min), the endocytosed Tfn labeled dispersed punctate structures that were characteristic of early endosomes, and there was little colocalization with GFP-Sec15. The rapid internalization of Tfn suggests that overexpression of Sec15 does not inhibit endocytosis. Interestingly, at the 10-min chase time, we observed partial overlap of internalized Tfn with GFP-Sec15 in the perinuclear region, and at later time points (20 and 30 min), substantial overlap was observed. Indeed, after a chase time of 30 min, the punctate perinuclear structures that were labeled for Sec15 were also predominantly Tfn-positive. These observations indicate that overexpressed Sec15 is associated with an endosomal compartment that is accessible to internalized Tfn. Overexpressed Sec15 Associates with Elements of the Recycling Endosome System—The kinetics of the appearance of internalized Tfn in the Sec15-positive structures (Fig. 5) are consistent with the possibility that the exocyst subunit associates with elements of the RE system (5Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 23Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In light of this, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy to confirm the lack of colocalization between GFP-Sec15 and the endosome markers EEA1 (early endosomes) and LAMP2 (late endosomes/lysosomes). We found that although the compartments labeled by endogenous EEA1 or LAMP2 were in close juxtaposition to the dots of fluorescence observed for Sec15, their localizations were predominantly distinct from the exocyst subunit (Fig. 6). The lack of colocalization with EEA1 is consistent with the observation that Sec15 did not overlap with the punctate Tfn-positive structures that were detected at early time points of internalization (0-min chase) (Fig. 5) and indicates that it does not label early endosomes. To confirm the colocalization between overexpressed Sec15 and internalized Tfn, immunoelectron microscopy was performed. CHO cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP-Sec15 and hTfnR. Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were incubated with Tfn-HRP for 30 min at 37 °C, and endosomal compartments were labeled with electron-dense peroxidase-3,3′-diaminobenzidine reaction product (16Stoorvogel W. Oorschot V. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Following fixation, ultrathin cryosections prepared from the transfected cells were incubated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, followed by a 10-nm gold particle-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary reagent (Fig. 7). We observed that GFP-Sec15 consistently labeled clusters of 50–75-nm diameter tubular/vesicular profiles that were Tfn-HRP-positive (Fig. 7, A and B). Labeling for the exocyst subunit was essentially restricted to these structures with the exception of a relatively low level of cytoplasmic staining. The tubular/vesicular clusters did not appear to be surrounded by a membrane, indicating that they are distinct from multivesicular bodies/late endosomal compartments. Gold particles were not detected on the Tfn-HRP-positive tubular/vesicular clusters when the anti-GFP antibody was substituted for an isotype control (Fig. 7C), indicating that the detection of GFP-Sec15 was specific. The strong colocalization observed between Sec15 and internalized Tfn prompted us to examine whether overexpression of the exocyst subunit might inhibit endosomal recycling. We were unable to perform a biochemical recycling assay due to low Sec15 transfection efficiencies. Therefore, a pulse-chase experiment was performed in which COS-7 cells expressing GFP-Sec15 (or control GFP) and hTfnR were incubated with Texas Red-labeled Tfn for 5 min at 37 °C (pulse) and chased with excess holo-Tfn for 40 min at 37 °C. Retention of internalized Tfn in transfected cells was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 8). When trafficking was terminated immediately following the pulse, Tfn was distributed throughout the cytoplasm in control GFP-expressing cells, reflecting transport to early endosomes. In cells expressing GFP-Sec15, the internalized Tfn exhibited a similar dispersed localization, although in this case, there was a higher level of perinuclear staining, which is likely to have resulted from arrival of"

One pathway that generates such species involves myeloperoxidase (MPO), a major constituent of artery wall macrophages. Another pathway involves peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant generated in the reaction of nitric oxide with superoxide. Both MPO and peroxynitrite produce 3-nitrotyrosine in vitro. To investigate the involvement of reactive nitrogen species in atherogenesis, we quantified 3-nitrotyrosine levels in HDL in vivo. The mean level of 3-nitrotyrosine in HDL isolated from human aortic atherosclerotic intima was 6-fold higher (619 ± 178 μmol/mol Tyr) than that in circulating HDL (104 ± 11 μmol/mol Tyr; p < 0.01). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated striking colocalization of MPO with epitopes reactive with an antibody to 3-nitrotyrosine. However, there was no significant correlation between the levels of 3-chlorotyrosine, a specific product of MPO, and those of 3-nitrotyrosine in lesion HDL. We also detected 3-nitrotyrosine in circulating HDL, and linear regression analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the levels of 3-chlorotyrosine and levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. These observations suggest that MPO promotes the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-nitrotyrosine in circulating HDL but that other pathways also produce 3-nitrotyrosine in atherosclerotic tissue. Levels of HDL isolated from plasma of patients with established coronary artery disease contained twice as much 3-nitrotyrosine as HDL from plasma of healthy subjects, suggesting that nitrated HDL might be a marker for clinically significant vascular disease. The detection of 3-nitrotyrosine in HDL raises the possibility that reactive nitrogen species derived from nitric oxide might promote atherogenesis.

Pathways that oxidize HDL and thereby impair its function might thus be pivotal to the development of atherosclerosis (12Navab M. Ananthramaiah G.M. Reddy S.T. Van Lenten B.J. Ansell B.J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1488-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet known whether HDL in the circulation or human artery wall might also be targeted for oxidation. We have described one pathway for LDL oxidation in humans (16Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). It involves hypochlorous acid and other reactive intermediates generated by myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by phagocytes. High concentrations of enzymatically active myeloperoxidase have been found in human vascular lesions (16Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 17Sugiyama S. Okada Y. Sukhova G.K. Virmani R. Heinecke J.W. Libby P. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), and characteristic protein and lipid oxidation products of the enzyme have been detected in LDL isolated from atherosclerotic tissue (18Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 19Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9957-9962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another oxidative pathway involves nitric oxide (nitrogen monoxide), which is generated by vascular wall cells (21Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol.l Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). NO is a relatively stable free radical that is unable to oxidize LDL directly under physiological conditions (22Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ischiropoulos H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, it reacts rapidly with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-) (24Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar), a reactive nitrogen species that promotes peroxidation of the lipid moiety of LDL in vitro (25Graham A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. O'Leary V. Darley-Usmar V. Moncada S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Proteins also appear vulnerable to ONOO- because the oxidant reacts in vitro with tyrosine residues to yield the stable product 3-nitrotyrosine (26Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions contains much higher levels of 3-nitrotyrosine than does circulating LDL, as monitored by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), a sensitive and specific method (27Leeuwenburgh C. Hardy M.M. Hazen S.L. Wagner P. Oh-ishi S. Steinbrecher U.P. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1433-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that reactive nitrogen species oxidize LDL in the human artery wall. Cultured endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells, all components of the atherosclerotic lesion, generate superoxide anion (28Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), suggesting that NO could form ONOO- or other reactive nitrogen intermediates in vascular tissue. The finding that antibodies to 3-nitrotyrosine recognize epitopes on all of these cell types in the artery wall is consistent with this proposal (29Beckmann J.S. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Moreover, elevated levels of nitrated plasma proteins associate with an increased risk of coronary artery disease, suggesting that oxidants derived from NO might modify circulating proteins or proteins that find their way into the bloodstream (30Shishehbor M.H. Aviles R.J. Brennan M.L. Fu X. Goormastic M. Pearce G.L. Gokce N. Keaney Jr., J.F. Penn M.S. Sprecher D.L. Vita J.A. Hazen S.L. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that fibrinogen is one target for nitration in plasma (31Vadseth C. Souza J.M. Thomson L. Seagraves A. Nagaswami C. Scheiner T. Torbet J. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. Murciano J.C. Muzykantov V. Penn M.S. Hazen S.L. Weisel J.W. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8820-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Also, exposing fibrinogen to nitrating oxidants in vitro accelerated clot formation, suggesting that fibrinogen nitration in vivo might be prothrombotic (31Vadseth C. Souza J.M. Thomson L. Seagraves A. Nagaswami C. Scheiner T. Torbet J. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. Murciano J.C. Muzykantov V. Penn M.S. Hazen S.L. Weisel J.W. Ischiropoulos H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8820-8826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether NO and superoxide produced at physiologically plausible rates nitrate tyrosine efficiently in vitro (32Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Pfeiffer S. Lass A. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34051-34058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), leaving open the possibility that 3-nitrotyrosine has a different origin in vivo. NO can also autoxidize to nitrite (NO2-), and plasma levels of NO2- rise markedly during acute and chronic inflammation (34Farrell A.J. Blake D.R. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1992; 51: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Because NO2- is a substrate for myeloperoxidase and other peroxidases, it might also be used to nitrate tyrosine in vivo (35Klebanoff S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 36Chance B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1952; 41: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Indeed, myeloperoxidase uses H2O2 and NO2- to generate reactive nitrogen species that nitrate free and protein-bound tyrosine residues and promote lipid peroxidation of LDL in vitro (37Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19199-19208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 38Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E.

Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These reactions might be physiologically relevant because tyrosine nitration is markedly impaired in a model of peritoneal inflammation in myeloperoxidase-deficient mice by a reaction pathway that appears to require NO2- or other intermediates derived from NO (41Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Hotchkiss R.S. Belaaouaj A. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In human atherosclerotic lesions, most cell-associated myeloperoxidase is found in and around macrophages (16Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme has also been detected in endothelial cells (42Baldus S. Eiserich J.P. Mani A. Castro L. Figueroa M. Chumley P. Ma W. Tousson A. White C.R. Bullard D.C. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Moore K.P. Freeman B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1759-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that reactive intermediates produced by peroxidases might generate the epitopes on macrophages and endothelial cells that are recognized by antibodies to 3-nitrotyrosine. In the current studies, we determined whether reactive nitrogen intermediates also oxidize HDL in vitro and in vivo. HDL isolated from atherosclerotic lesions and from plasma of humans with established coronary artery disease contained high levels of 3-nitrotyrosine as assessed by isotope dilution GC/MS analysis. Our observations strongly support the hypothesis that reactive nitrogen intermediates oxidize HDL in vivo. Myeloperoxidase (donor:hydrogen peroxide, oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) was isolated by lectin affinity and size exclusion chromatographies from human neutrophils (43Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L.D. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Hope H.R. Remsen E.E. Lewis Jr., C. Heuvelman D.M. Walker M.C. Jennings M. Connolly D.T. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and stored at -20 °C. Purified enzyme had an A430/A280 ratio of 0.8 and was apparently homogeneous on SDS-PAGE analysis; its concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ430 = 0.17 m-1 cm-1) (45Morita Y. Iwamoto H. Aibara S. Kobayashi T. Hasegawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) supplied 13C-labeled amino acids. 3-Nitro[13C6]tyrosine was synthesized using tetranitromethane under basic conditions (46Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by comparison with authentic material during reverse phase HPLC (46Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), trifluoroacetic acid, and HPLC grade CH3CN and methanol were obtained from Fisher. All of the organic solvents were HPLC grade. Isolation of HDL—Blood anticoagulated with EDTA was collected from healthy adults and patients with clinically and angiographically documented coronary artery disease who had fasted overnight. HDL (d = 1.125–1.210 g/ml) was prepared from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation (47Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated HDL was depleted of apo E and apo B100 by heparin-agarose chromatography (47Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Human Studies Committees at University of Washington School of Medicine and Wake Forest University School of Medicine approved all protocols involving human material. Isolation of Lesion HDL—Atherosclerotic tissue was harvested at endarterectomy, snap frozen, and stored frozen at -80 °C until analysis. Lesions from a single individual (∼0.5 g of wet weight) were mixed with dry ice and pulverized in a stainless steel mortar and pestle. All of the subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Powdered tissue was suspended in 2 ml of antioxidant buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), 100 μm butylated hydroxyl toluene, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) in a 2-ml centrifuge tube and rocked gently overnight. Tissue was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was extracted a second time with antioxidant buffer for 1 h. The pooled supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet and uppermost lipemic layer were discarded. HDL was isolated from the tissue extract by sequential density ultracentrifugation (d = 1.063–1.210 g/ml; (47Mendez A.J. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10104-10111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). DTPA and butylated hydroxytoluene (each 100 μm) were included in all solutions used for lipoprotein isolation. Lesion HDL was equilibrated with buffer A (0.1 mm DTPA, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) using a 100-kDa cut-off filter device (Millipore, Bredford, MA). Apo A-I in lesion HDL was detected by Western blotting using a rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody to human apo A-I (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Protein was determined using the Lowry assay, with albumin as the standard (Bio-Rad). Isolation of Plasma Proteins—Red blood cells were pelleted from blood anticoagulated with EDTA by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. Plasma was collected and stored at -80 °C. Freshly thawed plasma was diluted 20:1 (v/v) with buffer B (0.1 mm DTPA, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). The plasma proteins were precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v), collected by centrifugation, washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and delipidated twice with water/methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (1:3:7, v/v/v). HDL Oxidation in Vitro—Reactions were carried out in phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 μm DTPA) supplemented with 1 mg/ml HDL protein, 50 nm myeloperoxidase, 250 μm H2O2, and 500 μmNO2-. The reactions were initiated by the addition of oxidant and terminated by adding 2.5 mm methionine and 200 nm catalase. Following the addition of NaOH to the reaction mixture (final pH, >9), 3-nitrotyrosine formation was determined in a microplate reader by monitoring absorbance at 430 nm. Concentrations of HOCl and H2O2 were determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ292 = 350 m-1 cm-1 ϵ240 = 39.4 m1- cm-1) (48Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 49Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Studies—Hearts were excised at the time of cardiac transplantation in humans with cardiomyopathy (50O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Coronary artery segments obtained from hearts were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Atherosclerotic plaques were identified by morphological criteria (50O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Morphology was determined from 6-μm sections stained with Movat's pentachrome stains. Macrophages, myeloperoxidase, 3-nitrotyrosine, and apo A-I were identified with monoclonal antibody HAM-56 (1:10 dilution; Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA), rabbit polyclonal antisera (1:300 dilution; Dako), immunoaffinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and goat polyclonal antiserum (1:750 dilution), respectively. Single-label immunohistochemistry used previously described techniques (50O'Brien K.D. Olin K.L. Alpers C.E. Chiu W. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Wight T.N. Chait A. Circulation. 1998; 98: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Nova red (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), which yields a red reaction product, was used as the peroxidase substrate, and the cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Protein Hydrolysis—HDL protein was precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% v/v), collected by centrifugation, washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and delipidated twice with water/methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (1:3:7, v/v/v) (46Pennathur S. Wagner J.D. Leeuwenburgh C. Litwak K.N. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Isotopically labeled internal standards were added, and the samples were hydrolyzed at 110 °C for 12 h under argon with 4 n methane sulfonic acid (Sigma) supplemented with 1% benzoic acid and 1% phenol. Amino acids were isolated from the acid hydrolysate with two sequential solid phase extraction steps, using a C18 column followed by a Chrom P column (Supelclean SPE, Supelco Inc. Bellefonte, PA) (51Gaut J.P. Yeh G.C. Tran H.D. Byun J. Henderson J.P. Richter G.M. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Belaaouaj A. Hotchkiss R.S. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Authentic 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine were stable to acid hydrolysis, and recovery of the amino acids from the solid phase extraction columns were >80%. Isotope Dilution GC/MS Analysis—All of the samples were manually injected using an on column injector and a Hewlett Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 15-m DB-5 capillary column (inner diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.33 micron; J & W Scientific) interfaced with a Hewlett Packard 5973 mass detector. The t-butyl dimethylsilyl derivatives of amino acids were quantified by selected ion monitoring, using isotope dilution negative ion chemical ionization GC/MS (52Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Heinecke J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 300: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The level of 3-nitrotyrosine was quantified using the ratio between the ion of m/z 518 derived from 3-nitrotyrosine ([M-O-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl]-) and the ion of m/z 524 derived from 3-nitro[13C6]tyrosine. The level of 3-chlorotyrosine was quantified using the ratio between the ion of m/z 489 derived from 3-chlorotyrosine ([M-Cl-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl]-) and the ion of m/z 495 derived from 3-chloro[13C6]chlorotyrosine. Potential artifact formation was monitored as the appearance of ions at m/z 528 (nitration) or m/z 499 (chlorination) derived from l-[13C9, 15N]tyrosine added prior to sample work-up. Under these experimental conditions, artifact formation was <20% of 3-nitrotyrosine and <5% of 3-chlorotyrosine. l-Tyrosine is present at 10,000-fold higher levels than the oxidation products. Therefore the sample was diluted 1:100 and analyzed in a separate injection. l-Tyrosine and l-[13C6]tyrosine were quantified using the ions ([M-CO2-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl]-)at m/z 407 and m/z 413, respectively. Under these chromatography conditions, authentic compounds and isotopically labeled standards were base line-separated and exhibited retention times identical to those of analytes derived from tissue samples. The limit of detection (signal/noise > 10) was <100 attomol or <2 μmol/mol Tyr for all the amino acids. Results are normalized to protein content of Tyr, the precursor of 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine. Statistical Analysis—Results represent the means ± S.E. The differences between two groups were compared using the Student's t test. Correlations were determined using linear regression analysis for non-parametric data (Sigma Stat, SPSS). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Myeloperoxidase Generates 3-Nitrotyrosine in HDL Protein under Physiologically Relevant in Vitro Conditions—To determine whether myeloperoxidase can nitrate tyrosine residues on HDL protein, we incubated the lipoprotein with the enzyme at neutral pH in phosphate buffer containing NO2- (500 μm) and H2O2 (250 μm). We monitored the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine spectroscopically by quantifying absorbance of the alkalinized reaction mixture at 430 nm. 3-Nitrotyrosine was readily detected in HDL exposed to the complete myeloperoxidase-H2O2- NO2- system. Nitration required each component of the reaction mixture: NO2-, H2O2, and myeloperoxidase (Fig. 1A). The reaction depended on a NO2- concentration over a range of 0–1000 μm (Fig. 1B), was optimal at 250 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1C), and was complete in 20 min (Fig. 1D). It was inhibited by the peroxide scavenger catalase (200 nm) (Fig. 1D) and the heme poison sodium azide (10 mm) (data not shown). These results indicate that myeloperoxidase nitrates HDL by a reaction that requires active enzyme, NO2-, and H2O2. Myeloperoxidase Generates 3-Nitrotyrosine by Directly Oxidizing NO2-—It has been proposed that myeloperoxidase uses at least two distinct pathways to generate reactive nitrogen species (37Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19199-19208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the first pathway, the enzyme uses H2O2 and Cl- to generate HOCl, which then reacts with NO2- to form nitryl chloride, a nitrating species. In the second pathway, myeloperoxidase uses a one-electron reaction to directly oxidize NO2- to nitrogen dioxide radical, NO2·. The radical might then oxidize tyrosine directly or might react with tyrosyl radical that myeloperoxidase also generates (38Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 53van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two pathways, we examined the effect of plasma concentrations of chloride ion (Cl-) on nitration of HDL by the myeloperoxidase- H2O2−NO2− system (Fig. 2). We also determined whether taurine (2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid), a potent scavenger of HOCl, inhibited nitration by the myeloperoxidase or HOCl−NO2−. The extent of HDL nitration by myeloperoxidase was independent of Cl- (Fig. 2A). Taurine also had no effect when myeloperoxidase nitrated HDL in the presence of Cl- (Fig. 2B). Moreover, we were unable to detect 3-nitrotyrosine in HDL exposed to HOCl−NO2˙− (Fig. 2C). These observations indicate that HOCl produced by myeloperoxidase is not a major contributor to the nitration of HDL. Instead, the pathway likely involves direct oxidation"
https://openalex.org/W1972310474,"Regulation of protein function by reversible cysteine-targeted oxidation can be achieved by multiple mechanisms, such as S-glutathiolation, S-nitrosylation, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfenyl amide formation, as well as intramolecular disulfide bonding of vicinal thiols. Another cysteine oxidation state with regulatory potential involves the formation of intermolecular protein disulfides. We utilized two-dimensional sequential non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE (diagonal electrophoresis) to investigate intermolecular protein disulfide formation in adult cardiac myocytes subjected to a series of interventions (hydrogen peroxide, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, doxorubicin, simulated ischemia, or metabolic inhibition) that alter the redox status of the cell. More detailed experiments were undertaken with the thiol-specific oxidant diamide (5 mm), a concentration that induces a mild non-injurious oxidative stress. This increase in cellular oxidation potential caused global intermolecular protein disulfide formation in cytosolic, membrane, and myofilament/cytoskeletal compartments. A large number of proteins that undergo these associations were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. These associations, which involve metabolic and antioxidant enzymes, structural proteins, signaling molecules, and molecular chaperones, were confirmed by assessing “shifts” on non-reducing immunoblots. The observation of widespread protein-protein disulfides indicates that these oxidative associations are likely to be fundamental in how cells respond to redox changes. Regulation of protein function by reversible cysteine-targeted oxidation can be achieved by multiple mechanisms, such as S-glutathiolation, S-nitrosylation, sulfenic acid, sulfinic acid, and sulfenyl amide formation, as well as intramolecular disulfide bonding of vicinal thiols.

We utilized two-dimensional sequential non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE (diagonal electrophoresis) to investigate intermolecular protein disulfide formation in adult cardiac myocytes subjected to a series of interventions (hydrogen peroxide, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, doxorubicin, simulated ischemia, or metabolic inhibition) that alter the redox status of the cell. More detailed experiments were undertaken with the thiol-specific oxidant diamide (5 mm), a concentration that induces a mild non-injurious oxidative stress. This increase in cellular oxidation potential caused global intermolecular protein disulfide formation in cytosolic, membrane, and myofilament/cytoskeletal compartments. A large number of proteins that undergo these associations were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. These associations, which involve metabolic and antioxidant enzymes, structural proteins, signaling molecules, and molecular chaperones, were confirmed by assessing “shifts” on non-reducing immunoblots. The observation of widespread protein-protein disulfides indicates that these oxidative associations are likely to be fundamental in how cells respond to redox changes. Oxidants have been implicated in the pathogenesis of most major diseases (1Klein J.A. Ackerman S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Finkel T.

Circulation. 2003; 108: 1912-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). However, substantial contemporary evidence is emerging that shows that these species play important regulatory roles in the everyday function of cells and tissues (6Soberman R.J. J. Clin.

Science's STKE. 2000; (www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/53/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar). The roles of oxidants as signaling, or regulatory entities, that allow cell function to be coupled to its redox status is being increasingly established. In terms of abundance, the most important redox couples within cells involve the equilibrium between reduced and oxidized forms of thiols. The status of the cellular reduction potential, which essentially is an index of the thiol redox status, varies during the life history of a cell. For example, the cellular reduction potential has characteristic set points depending on whether tissue is quiescent, proliferating, confluent, differentiating, or apoptotic (10Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3676) Google Scholar, 11Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Changes in cellular redox potential to a more oxidizing state can be triggered by a number of processes in healthy tissue, such as metabolism and signaling events. Under basal conditions neurohormonal substances not only activate classical signaling pathways, but also transactivate others that are dependent on the generation of endogenously derived oxidants such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, or nitric oxide (12Rhee S.G. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 53-59sCrossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 13Mahadev K. Wu X. Zilbering A. Zhu L. Lawrence T.R. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol.

When the cellular oxidation potential is elevated, protein thiols within the cell become susceptible to modification. A number of reversible protein thiol oxidation states can be produced, including S-thiolated (15Eaton P. Byers H.L. Leeds N. Ward M.A. Shattock M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9806-9811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), S-nitrosylated (8Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.F.

Res. 2001; 52: 294-301Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Vicinal thiols, which form intramolecular protein disulfides, are also an established mode of cysteine-targeted oxidation that allows regulatory control (20Gitler C. Zarmi B. Kalef E. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Another form of protein-cysteine oxidation that is predicted to occur in cells under oxidizing conditions involves the formation of a disulfide bond between proteins. In this study we utilized two-dimensional sequential non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE (diagonal electrophoresis) (21Sommer A. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3946-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), to separate proteins that form disulfides in myocardial cells under an oxidative burden. These proteins have then been identified using LC-MS/MS, 1The abbreviations used are: LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatographymass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator. and provide new insights as to how proteins and cells respond to changes in their redox environment. Cell Preparation—Calcium-tolerant ventricular myocytes were isolated from the hearts of male Wistar rats (250–300 g) using a standard collagenase digestion protocol as described previously (22James A.F. Ramsey J.E. Reynolds A.M. Hendry B.M. Shattock M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1048-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Animals received humane care in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (43Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). After isolation, myocytes were kept at room temperature in Tyrode buffer for 3 h after isolation before subsequent treatments. Assessing Interventions That Induce Protein-Protein Disulfides—We screened a series of oxidative interventions for their ability to promote intermolecular protein disulfide bonds. Control or treated cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 0.5 min and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 0.05% digitonin, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm maleimide and left on ice for 5min. Soluble protein was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 2 min) and reconstituted in SDS sample buffer without a reducing agent but with 100 mm maleimide. The sample was then analyzed by diagonal electrophoresis, as described below. Interventions investigated using this approach included treatment with diamide (5 mm for 10 min), hydrogen peroxide (0.1, 1, or 10 mm for 10 min), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mm for 10 min), doxorubicin (0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 mm for 10 min), N-acetylcysteine (10 mm for 10 min), metabolic inhibition, or simulated ischemia. Metabolic inhibition was induced by treating cells in control buffer with dinitrophenol (0.01 mm) and deoxyglucose (10 mm) for 10 min. Simulated ischemia was achieved by incubating cells in an argon-purged buffer consisting of 4.2 mm HEPES, 130 mm NaCl, 12 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm 2-deoxyglucose 1, 20 mm sodium lactate, pH 6.5, for 1, 3, or 6 h. Subcellular Fractionation Studies in Diamide-treated Myocytes—In separate experiments, cells were divided into two aliquots and treated for 10 min with diamide (final concentration 5 mm) or tyrode buffer alone as a control. Following treatment cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 0.5 min, the supernatant was removed, and cells were washed in isolation buffer. This was repeated, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 0.05% digitonin, and 100 mm maleimide and left for 5 min on ice with frequent vortexing. The samples were then spun at 10,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was kept (cytosolic fraction). The pellet was washed in lysis buffer and then resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The samples were spun again, and the supernatant was kept (membrane fraction). The Triton X-100 insoluble pellet (myofilament fraction) was washed and then resuspended in lysis buffer. Additional immunoblot studies with antibodies to marker proteins for each of these fractions (not shown) showed that this fractionation protocol was effective. Fractions were reconstituted in SDS sample buffer, free of reducing agents, containing 100 mm maleimide. Maleimide was present in all samples to block all free thiol groups and prevent thiol-disulfide exchange or thiol oxidation during preparation. Sequential Two-dimensional Non-reducing/reducing SDS-PAGE— This method has been referred to as diagonal electrophoresis (21Sommer A. Traut R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3946-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions (cytosolic, membrane, or myofilament in SDS sample buffer without a reducing agent) from control or diamide-treated preparations were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad mini protean III system). After non-reducing electrophoresis, the entire lane containing the resolved proteins was excised and rotated through 90° and laid horizontally on top of a large format 1.5-mm thick 12% acrylamide gel (Hoefer S.E. 600). The gel slice was incubated in SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol (to reduce any disulfide bonds present between proteins) for 10 min. At this stage proteins that were linked by a disulfide bond are separated by dithiothreitol treatment and then resolved from one another, allowing them to migrate further down the gel at their true weight in the second reducing dimension. Control or diamide-treated fractions were laid adjacent to each other on one large format gel and run simultaneously to ensure that valid comparisons can be made between treatments. Gels were stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue G stain to visualize the proteins and then destained in 20% methanol. Protein spots/bands that run off of the diagonal and to the left of the slope, and that are only present after diamide treatment, represent proteins that formed oxidative disulfide-mediated associations following diamide treatment. Spots/bands were excised in preparation for identification using LC-MS/MS. Immunoblotting—Non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using the Bio-Rad mini protean III system. In some experiments, samples were supplemented with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol to confirm that any S-glutathiolation signal detected was reversible or that diamide-induced molecular weight shifts were because of disulfide bond formation. After electrophoresis samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride using a Bio-Rad semidry blotter. Primary antibodies used in these studies included pan-specific mouse monoclonal to S-glutathiolated proteins (ViroGen Corporation, Water-town, MA), protein kinase C (PKC)α, -δ, and -ϵ isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), heat shock protein 70 (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada), heat shock protein 60 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), adenine nucleotide transporter (gift from Professor Andrew Halestrap, Bristol University, UK), protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit (Calbiochem). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize the oxidized proteins. Identification of Unknown Proteins Using LC-MS/MS—In-gel digestion with trypsin was performed according to published methods (23Jeno P. Mini T. Moes S. Hintermann E. Horst M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar, 25Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), modified for use with a robotic digestion system (Investigator ProGest, Genomic Solutions, Huntington, UK) (26Wait R. Gianazza E. Eberini I. Sironi L. Dunn M. Gemeiner M. Miller I. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 3043-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The Coomassie stain was removed from the excised gel pieces by sequential washing with 50 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer and acetonitrile. Cysteine residues were reduced with dithiothreitol and derivatized by treatment with iodoacetamide. After further washing with ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer the gel pieces were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried at 60 °C prior to addition of modified trypsin (Promega, 10 μl at 6.5 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate). Digestion proceeded for 8 h at 37 °C, and products were recovered by sequential extractions with 25 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate, 5% formic acid, and acetonitrile. The pooled extracts were lyophilized and redissolved in 0.1% formic acid for mass spectrometry. Tandem electrospray mass spectra were recorded using a Q-Tof hybrid quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) interfaced to a Micromass CapLC capillary chromatograph. Samples were dissolved in 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and 6 μl was injected onto a Pepmap C18 column (300 μm × 0.5 cm; LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands), and washed for 3 min with 0.1% aqueous formic acid (with the stream select valve diverting the column effluent to waste). The flow rate was then reduced to 1 μl/min, the stream select valve was switched to the data acquisition position, and the peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer with an acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid gradient (5–70% acetonitrile over 20 min). The capillary voltage was set to 3500 V, and data-dependant MS/MS acquisitions were performed on precursors with charge states of 2, 3, or 4 over a survey mass range of 540–1000. Trypsin autolysis products and keratin-derived precursor ions were automatically excluded. The collision voltage was varied between 18 and 45 V depending on the charge and mass of the precursor. Product ion spectra were charge-state deencrypted and de-isotoped with a maximum entropy algorithm (Max-Ent 3, Micromass). Proteins were identified by the correlation of uninterpreted tandem mass spectra to entries in SwissProt/TREMBL, using ProteinLynx Global Server (Version 1.1, Micromass). One missed cleavage/peptide was allowed, and an initial mass tolerance of 50 ppm was used in all searches (27Wait R. Miller I. Eberini I. Cairoli F. Veronesi C. Battocchio M. Gemeiner M. Gianazza E. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The search allowed for possible modifications of peptides by iodoacetamide, which if present would identify the cysteine residue(s) involved in disulfide bond formation. Maleimide-containing peptides would identify cysteines not involved in the oxidative associations. Fig. 1 shows a selection of Coomassie-stained diagonal gels, which were carried out as part of a detailed assessment of interventions that might promote interprotein disulfide bond formation. Only a selection of the stained gels collected in these studies are shown here. In summary, treatment with hydrogen peroxide (0.1 mm), SNAP (0.01 mm, 0.1 mm or 1 mm), doxorubicin (0.001 mm, 0.01 mm or 0.1 mm), N-acetylcysteine (10 mm), or simulated ischemia (1, 3 or 6 h) failed to increase or decrease interprotein disulfide bonds detected in control preparations. In contrast, diamide (5 mm) and hydrogen peroxide (1 and especially 10 mm) were particularly efficacious at promoting these protein associations, as indicated by spots or bands below and to the left of the diagonal. Spots or bands that run off of the diagonal and to the left of the slope indicate proteins that formed protein-protein disulfides. There was a trend for metabolic inhibition and doxorubicin to initiate some protein interactions, but this was relatively minor compared with diamide (5 mm) and hydrogen peroxide (10 mm) interventions. We used isolated adult ventricular myocytes under control conditions or following treatment with the thiol oxidant diamide at a concentration of 5, 50, or 100 mm. Visual inspection showed no discernable differences between the cells in any of the test solutions and thus no visible evidence that the cells were particularly stressed. In subsequent studies (see below) in which we assessed intermolecular disulfide formation; cells were incubated in 5 mm diamide for 10 min. On this basis, we have reasoned that the degree of oxidative stress we imposed on the cells in these studies was mild. Although diamide treatment caused no visible signs of damage, Fig. 2 illustrates that the cells are still under an oxidative burden. This is illustrated by the fact that myocytes treated with diamide (5 mm for 10 min) promoted S-glutathiolation of several proteins. The signals produced by S-glutathiolated proteins were abolished when 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the samples, confirming that the signal was dependent on the presence of a disulfide bond, which helps confirm the specificity of the antibody. Fig. 3A is a Coomassie-stained diagonal gel of a cytosolicenriched fraction. The sample was prepared from control or diamide-treated isolated ventricular myocytes. Clearly some proteins such as peroxiredoxin 2 (Fig. 3A, band 4) run off of the diagonal in control preparations as well, possibly illustrating a disulfide-mediated interaction under basal conditions. However, peroxiredoxin 2 moved further to the left following diamide treatment and formed a weakly stained broad band on the gel, which was clearer on the actual gel and is now highlighted by a dotted outline (Fig. 3A, band 5). Fig. 3B shows a Coomassie-stained diagonal gel of a membrane-enriched fraction, comparing intermolecular protein disulfides in control or diamide-treated cells. As occurred in the cytosolic fraction, a number of membrane proteins underwent diamide-mediated disulfide bonding. Diamide also promoted intermolecular protein disulfide in the Triton-insoluble fraction (Fig. 3C), which is enriched in myofilament, cytoskeletal, and nuclear proteins. Together these diagonal SDS-polyacrylamide gels show widespread protein-protein disulfide bond formation, in multiple subcellular locations, following mild oxidative stress. Proteins that ran off of the diagonal (i.e. formed protein disulfides) following diamide treatment were identified using LC-MS/MS analysis of tryptic digests. The full list of proteins identified in this way is shown in Table I. We had hoped to map a significant number of the actual cysteine residues involved in interprotein disulfide formation, which are identified by iodoacetamide labeling. However, on the whole this was not successfully achieved. We did observe Cys-289 of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, Cys-471 of SERCA2, and Cys-145 of the α subunit of the trifunctional enzyme α subunit to be carboxyamidomethylated (modified by iodoacetamide), indicating that these are cysteines involved in disulfide formation.Table IList of proteins that form intermolecular disulfide bonds during myocyte oxidative stressSpot numberProtein identifiedIdentification codeCytosol fraction1Unidentified2Nucleoside diphosphate kinase ANDKA_RAT3Heat shock 20 kDa-like protein p20HSBX_RAT3Glycerladehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseG3P_RAT4, 5Peroxiredoxin 2PDX2_RAT6Unidentified7Peroxiredoxin 3gi 119681328Triose-phosphate isomeraseTPIS_RAT9-10Unidentified11Skeletal muscle LIM-protein 3SLI3_RAT14-17Glycerladehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseG3P_RAT18Actingi 11329019Creatine kinase mitochondrial 2gi 3825920619Actin β-ratACTB_RAT20Actingi 11329021cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alKAP0_RAT22Tubulin α-4 chaingi 667846722Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A2ABA_RAT23Tubulin α-4 chaingi 667846724Similar to tubulin α-1 chaingi 2766475825T-complex protein 1, α subunitTCPA_RAT26Unidentified27HSP 90-βHS9B_RAT28, 29Glycogen phosphorylasePHS2_RAT30Similar to amylo-1, 6-glucosidase, 4-α-glucanotransferase isoform 1gi 34859913Membrane fraction31Superoxide dismutaseSODC_RAT32Superoxide dismutaseSODM_RAT34Antioxident proteingi 2168557834Kynureninasegi 214381835-39ADP, ATP carrier proteinADT1_RAT40DNA segment, Chr 10gi 2007042041Manganese superoxide dismutasegi 5669142ADP, ATP carrier proteinADT1_RAT42Phosphate-carrier proteinMPCP_RAT43Phosphate-carrier proteinMPCP_RAT44Phosphate-carrier proteinMPCP_RAT443-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase precursorgi 11129546Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasegi 839341847Malate dehydrogenaseMDHM_RAT47Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasegi 839341848Malate dehydrogenaseMDHM_RAT49ADP/ATP transport proteingi 214357049Similar to Peci proteingi 3487529150Aspartate transaminase precursorgi 9031151Isocitrate dehydrogenasegi 2737051651Acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolaseMTE1_RAT51Actingi 34856664513-Ketoacyl-CoA thiolaseTHIM_RAT52Creatine kinasegi 3825920653Isocitrate dehydrogenasegi 2737051653Elongation factor, TuQ8BFR553Similar to RIKEN cDNAgi 3485918754Isocitrate dehydrogenasegi 2737051655Tubulin β-15 chaingi 9293055Dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase compODO2_RAT55CalsequestrinCAQ2_RAT55Similar to sarcalumeningi 3486868155Ac1164gi 3226461356Sarcoplasmic reticulum 53K glycoprotein preQ8BS4356Dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase compODO2_RAT56H(+)-transporting ATP synthasegi 5702957ATP synthase α chainATPA_RAT58Propionyl-CoA carboxylase β chainPCCB_RAT59Unidentified60Amine oxidaseAOFA_RAT61Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase componentODP2_RAT61Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long-chain sACDV_RAT62Succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit A, flavoproteingi 1842685863Trifunctional enzyme α subunitECHA_RAT63Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase componentODP2_RAT63NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductaseNUAM_HUMAN64Long-chain fatty acid—CoA ligaseLCFB_RAT64Hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenasegi 1867776364NADH dehydrogenasegi 2170402065Long-chain fatty acid—CoA ligaseLCFB_RAT65AconitaseO7594466Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcATA2_RATTriton-insoluble fraction68, 69Myoglobingi 1102465070Unidentified72Myosin light chain 1MLEV_RAT72Peroxiredoxin 3gi 1196813273Unidentified74ADP,ATP carrier proteinADT1_RAT74Troponin ITRIC_RAT75ADP,ATP carrier proteinADT1_RAT76Unidentified77Phosphate carrier proteinMPCP_RAT78Phosphate carrier proteinMPCP_RAT78α-S1 casein precursorCAS1_RAT79Glycerladehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseG3P_RAT79Tropomyosin ITPM1_RAT80Striated muscle α tropomyosingi 5740680Similar to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasegi 3485271581Isocitrate dehydrogenaseIDHP_RAT81Actingi 71620813-Ketoacyl-CoA thiolaseTHIM_RAT81Golgi-associated protein GCP360gi 2030206581Unnamed protein productgi 1284810282Creatine kinasegi 3485311282Similar to α actingi 3485666483Creatine kinasegi 3485311283Similar to gamma actin-like proteingi 3485651284Actingi 9026385ATP synthase β chainATPB_RAT86DesminDESM_RAT87ADP/ATP transport proteingi 214357087Similar to sarcalumeningi 3486868188DesminDESM_RAT89Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase componentODP2_RAT90Dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase componentODP2_RAT91Long-chain fatty acid—COA ligase 2LCFB_RAT91Myosin heavy chainMYH7_RAT92Mitochondrial aconitasegi 1063799692Myosin heavy chainMYH6_RAT92NADH dehydrogenasegi 2170402092Trifunctional enzyme α subunitECHA_RAT93Similar to actinin α 2gi 34876265 Open table in a new tab Following the identification of the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) as a protein that undergoes protein disulfide formation using diagonal SDS-PAGE, we analyzed samples under non-reducing or reducing conditions by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 4). ANT formed multiple disulfide-mediated interactions following diamide treatment, although only a relatively small proportion of the total pool of this protein formed these associations. In contrast, when we assessed the distribution of the regulatory subunit of PKA (Fig. 5A), which was also identified using diagonal gels, we found the total pool of this kinase shifts to approximately double its molecular weight via disulfide bond formation. We also assessed the subcellular distribution of this protein (Fig. 5B) and found that the kinase subunit remained primarily in the cytosolic fraction following diamide treatment.Fig. 5PKA dimerization and subcellular distribution following diamide treatment.A, Western immunoblot showing that diamide promoted the entire pool of the regulatory subunit of PKA to undergo a molecular weight shift, which can be reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol treatment. B, during this disulfide-mediated molecular weight (Mwt) shift PKA remains primarily in the cytosolic fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 6 shows non-reducing immunoblots, which demonstrate that PKC isoforms form interprotein associations following diamide treatment. Treatment of the samples with 2-mercaptoethanol caused the banding pattern to be normalized confirming the associations involve intermolecular protein disulfide bonds. Although PKCα formed these associations, it was only to a relatively small extent compared with PKCδ and -ϵ, in which a substantial proportion of the total pool formed disulfide associations. The same samples were also analyzed for HSP60 and HSP70 distribution (not shown), which are also known to contain redox active thiols and may therefore be expected to form interprotein disulfides. However, in contrast to the PKC isoforms investigated, the HSPs did not undergo disulfide-mediated protein associations. Cellular Redox State in Health and Disease—Healthy cells are generally found in the reduced redox state, the maintenance of which is dependent on the equilibrium between oxidized and reduced thiols (10Schafer F.Q.

https://openalex.org/W1977064582,"We have established the structures of 10 human microRNA (miRNA) precursors using biochemical methods. Eight of these structures turned out to be different from those that were computer-predicted. The differences localized in the terminal loop region and at the opposite side of the precursor hairpin stem. We have analyzed the features of these structures from the perspectives of miRNA biogenesis and active strand selection. We demonstrated the different thermodynamic stability profiles for pre-miRNA hairpins harboring miRNAs at their 5′- and 3′-sides and discussed their functional implications. Our results showed that miRNA prediction based on predicted precursor structures may give ambiguous results, and the success rate is significantly higher for the experimentally determined structures. On the other hand, the differences between the predicted and experimentally determined structures did not affect the stability of termini produced through “conceptual dicing.” This result confirms the value of thermodynamic analysis based on mfold as a predictor of strand section by RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). We have established the structures of 10 human microRNA (miRNA) precursors using biochemical methods. Eight of these structures turned out to be different from those that were computer-predicted.

Cell. 2003; 115: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). Based on the mechanism of the precursor hairpin processing and the similarities between the miRNA and RNAi pathways, active siRNA duplexes could be predicted with a high success rate (17Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz D.S. Hutvágner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D.

It appears that designing siRNAs so that their properties resemble those of putative double-stranded miRNA intermediates, produces highly effective siRNAs. The strand whose 5′-end is less tightly paired to its complement is selected to enter into the RNAi-induced silencing complex, whereas the opposite strand is degraded. Thus, the structure of miRNA precursors and their short lived processing intermediates turned out to be the key for successful siRNA design (17Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz D.S. Hutvágner G. Du T. Xu Z. Aronin N. Zamore P.D.

In this light it was surprising that no experimental verification of microRNA precursor structures, which were all computer-predicted, was done thus far. The miRNA precursors are predicted to form irregular hairpin structures containing various mismatches, internal loops and bulges (19Griffiths-Jones S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D109-D111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and several structures with little difference in the lowest free energy are often proposed by a structure prediction program (20Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar). To find the structure that is most favorable in solution we implemented experimental methods. Chemical and enzymatic probing of nucleotide accessibility (21Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B.

Elsevier Sciences Ltd., Oxford2001: 71-89Crossref Google Scholar) was chosen to obtain reliable structure information rapidly, taking advantage of the distinct specificity of different chemical reagents and nucleases. The experimentally determined secondary structures were searched for their properties relevant to the postulated mechanism of miRNA biogenesis (23Bartel D.

Biol. 2004; 3: 214-218Crossref Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We used for this purpose an improved version of the recently described thermodynamic structure profiling method (17Khvorova A. Reynolds A. Jayasena S.D. Cell. 2003; 115: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). Other than the specific thermodynamic and reactivity signatures of individual precursors, characteristic profiles have been revealed corresponding to the groups of precursors containing miRNAs either at the 5′- or 3′-side of their hairpin stem. Preparation of DNA Templates for in Vitro Transcription—DNA oligomers were obtained by chemical synthesis and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each oligomer contains a DNA sequence complementary to the microRNA precursor sequence and to the sequence of T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 3′-end (see Table I). The double-stranded templates for in vitro transcription were prepared using the primer extension procedure (200 pmol of template oligomer and 1 mmol of T7GG primer 5′-taatacgactcactatagg, 200 μm each dNTPs, standard PCR buffer, and 0.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase/100 μl of reaction mixture) in two-step PCR, 50 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s and 45 °C for 15 s, and were purified using centrifugal filter devices Microcon YM30 (Millipore).Table IOligodeoxynucleotides used for transcript synthesisNameDNA oligomer sequence (5′—3′)aT7 promoter sequence underlined for in vitro transcriptionbResidues added to the DNA templates to enable efficient in vitro transcription.

These extra nucleotides when transcribed constitute the only differences between the proposed sequences of natural pre-miRNAs (3Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Lendlecker W. Tuschl T. Science. 2001; 294: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (3975) Google Scholar) and these investigated in this study Open table in a new tab Transcription in Vitro—The pre-microRNAs used in this study were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. The transcription reaction carried out in a 50-μl volume contained 20 pmol of DNA template, 50 μm rNTPs, 3.3 mm guanosine, 40 units of ribonuclease inhibitor RNase Out (Invitrogen), and 400 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion). The guanosine was added to the reaction mixture to place it at the 5′-end in a high proportion of transcripts, thus making the 5′-end dephosphorylation step unnecessary. The transcription reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h, and transcripts were purified in denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel, excised, eluted from the gel (0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS), and precipitated. All transcripts were 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN). The labeled RNAs were gel-purified and stored at -70 °C in water before use. Nuclease Digestions and Metal Ions Induced Cleavages of RNA—Prior to structure probing, the 32P-labeled transcripts were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedure, in a solution containing 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 48 mm NaCl, and 1.2 mm MgCl2 by heating the sample at 90 °C for 1 min followed by a slow cooling to 37 °C. Limited digestion of RNA was performed at 37 °C in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2 (0.5 mm ZnCl2 was also present in reactions with nuclease S1) obtained by mixing 8 μl of the RNA solution described above (∼5 pmol of RNA) with 2 μl of a probe at different concentrations. Final concentrations of probes in the reactions were as follows: S1 nuclease, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 units/μl; T1 ribonuclease, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 units/μl; T2 ribonuclease, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 units/μl; V1 ribonuclease, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05 units/μl; Pb2+ ions, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mm; Mn2+ ions, 1.5, 5, and 7.5 mm; Mg2+ ions, 1.5, 5, and 7.5 mm; Ca2+ ions, 1.5, 5, and 7.5 mm. Reactions with Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions were performed at 37 °C in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, or 9.0 and 40 mm NaCl. The reactions with nucleases and lead ions were stopped after 10 min, reactions with Mn2+ after 2 h, and reactions with Mg2+ and Ca2+ after 16 h by adding an equal volume of a stop solution containing 7.5 m urea, 20 mm EDTA, and dyes. The alkaline hydrolysis ladder was generated by the incubation of the labeled RNA in formamide containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 100 °C for 10 min. The partial digestion of RNAs (∼5 pmol) with T1 ribonuclease was performed under semidenaturing conditions (10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 3.5 m urea) for 12 min at 55 °C with 0.2 units/μl of the enzyme. Electrophoresis was in 15% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions at 1500 V and was followed by autoradiography at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. The products of the structure-probing reactions were also visualized and analyzed by phosphorimaging (Typhoon, Molecular Dynamics). To minimize the possible contributions from secondary cleavages, the cuts generated in the transcripts that underwent the reaction in less than 10% were considered in the structure analysis. Electrophoresis in Nondenaturing Conditions—The homogeneity of the RNA structure was analyzed for all investigated transcripts by the electrophoresis of radiolabeled samples in 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (dimensions 150 × 140 × 1 mm) (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29/1) buffered with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and containing 40 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2 at a controlled temperature of 37 °C. Prior to gel electrophoresis, the 32P-labeled transcripts (∼5 pmol each) were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedure as described in the preceding section but in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 40 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2 and mixed with an equal volume of the same solution containing 7% sucrose and dyes. Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V with buffer circulation at 2 liter/h. RNA Secondary Structure Prediction—RNA secondary structure prediction was performed using the mfold program version 3.1 (20Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar). This program is designed to determine the optimal and suboptimal secondary structures of RNA and to count free energy contributions for various secondary structure motifs. RNA Thermodynamic Profiling—The internal hairpin stability values were calculated according to the nearest neighbor method using thermodynamic parameters determined at 37 °C, for all stacking free energy values (expressed in kcal/mole), taking into consideration all the different destabilizing elements such as internal loops and bulges, using the 3.1 version of the mfold program (20Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar). Two different kinds of RNAs, pre-miRNAs and duplex intermediates, were analyzed using procedures that differed in some aspects as follows. The analysis of precursor structures was performed using trinucleotide subsequences to define their central position. To adjust the stability profiles to the corresponding secondary structures the ΔG values characteristic for the base pair closing the single-stranded region were assigned also for other structural elements of this region (supplemental Fig. 5A). On the other hand, in the analysis of duplex intermediates, instead of using the scanning window, the thermodynamic parameters were calculated for each interacting base pair and each structure-destabilizing element (supplemental Fig. 5B). Selected miRNA Precursors and Probes Used for Structure Analysis—We intended to experimentally analyze the secondary structure of representative human pre-miRNAs. We selected the following 10 pre-miRNAs of which five, pre-let-7c, pre-let-7f-2, pre-miR-15a, pre-miR-16-1, and pre-miR-18, have the mature miRNA at the 5′-side, four, pre-miR-19a, pre-miR-25, pre-miR-29a, and pre-miR-30a, have the mature miRNA on the 3′-side, and one, pre-miR-17, on both sides. When these RNAs were subjected to structure prediction using the mfold program (20Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar) the resulting lowest energy precursor hairpins differed in their terminal loop size as well as in the number, size, and location of various internal loops and/or bulges. For half of the analyzed precursors two or more alternative structures were proposed within the 10% range of the suboptimality parameter. For the experimental analysis, we chemically synthesized DNA templates (Table I) that allowed the in vitro transcription of pre-miRNAs. The extra nucleotides added to the precursor sequences to allow their efficient in vitro transcription did not change their mfold predicted structures. The transcripts were 5′-end-labeled and gel-purified. Their structural homogeneity was confirmed by electrophoresis in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (supplemental Fig. 1A). Next, we subjected the RNAs to structure probing as shown in supplemental Fig. 1, B and C for the pre-let-7f-2 and pre-miR-29a. The chemical probes used to analyze each transcript were Mg2+ (25Marciniec T. Ciesiolka J. Wrzesinski J. Krzyzosiak W.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 243: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), Mn2+ (26Wrzesinski J. Michalowski D. Ciesiolka J. Krzyzosiak W.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Ca2+ (27Streicher B. Westhof E. Schroeder R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and Pb2+ ions (28Ciesiolka J. Michalowski D. Wrzesinski J. Krajewski J. Krzyzosiak W.J. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5771-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and nucleases included the single-strand-specific S1, T1, and T2 (31Knapp G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and double-strand-specific V1 (32Favorova O.O. Fasiolo F. Keith G. Vassilenko S.K. Ebel J.P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1006-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Lockard R.E. Kumar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5125-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The metal ions differentiate between rigid and flexible regions of the RNA structure. The former are resistant and latter susceptible to cleavage in agreement with the mechanism proposed for phosphodiester bond cleavage by lead (34Brown R.S. Hingerty B.E. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Nature. 1983; 303: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 35Brown R.S. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4785-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In brief, the reaction begins with the activation of the ribose 2′-OH group by the metal ion hydroxide, and the attack of the 2′-O-nucleophile on the adjacent phosphorus atom, which requires conformational flexibility of the sugar phosphate backbone. The Majority of Experimentally Determined Structures of miRNA Precursors Differ from Those Predicted—When we subjected the labeled transcripts to single-strand-specific probes the centrally located nucleotides of all miRNA precursor sequences were found to be the most reactive regions. This suggested hairpin structures in which the regions of enhanced reactivity corresponded to their terminal loops. The Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions turned out to be the probes distinguishing most precisely between paired and unpaired nucleotides in the stem regions of the precursor hairpins (Fig. 1). The reactive phosphodiester bonds mapped by these two probes often overlap each other, and the Ca2+ ions cut the great majority of internucleotide bonds present in numerous bulges and internal loops. For example, among eight stem-structure-distorting motifs proposed to exist in pre-miR-18, as many as seven are recognized by the Ca2+ ions and five by Mg2+ ions. The only motif undetected by Ca2+ ions in this structure is the single nucleotide A-bulge. This pattern of reactivity is in line with the flexible geometry and variable coordination number of the Ca2+ aquacation in solution (36Pyle A.M. Sigel A. Sigel H. Metal ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, Inc., Basel, Switzerland1996: 479-520Google Scholar). The sizes of terminal loops of the precursor hairpins are well mapped by the single-strand-specific nucleases (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2). On the other hand, the small internal loops, bulges, and mismatches are poorly mapped by the enzymatic probes. For example, neither the symmetrical 6-nucleotide nor asymmetrical 3-nucleotide internal loops present in pre-miR29a were cleaved by the nucleases. Among the detected motifs are bulges mapped by the T2 ribonuclease in pre-let-7c, miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-19a, and miR-30a precursors. Their detection is in agreement with the earlier observations that nucleases recognize well larger single-stranded regions. The failure of nucleases, and in some cases also metal ions, to detect small symmetrical internal loops and mismatches when they are surrounded by stable double-helical regions may indicate that these motifs form noncanonical base pairs (37Kierzek R. Burkard M.E. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14214-14223Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 38Leontis N.B. Westhof E. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), which do not distort the duplex structure significantly. The advantageous feature of metal ions in RNA structure probing is that their hydrates are much smaller than nucleases, penetrate folded RNAs easier, and reveal more details of the analyzed structures (39Michalowski D. Wrzesinski J. Krzyzosiak W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10727-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Altogether, aside from hairpin terminal loops, 47 other structure motifs such as internal loops, bulges, and mismatches other than G-U wobble pairs are proposed to occur in the experimentally determined secondary structures of 10 analyzed precursors (Figs. 1 and 2, supplemental Figs. 2 and 3). The 12 of the 13 internal loops are mapped by the Ca2+ ions at both strands (Fig. 1). The Mg2+ ions failed to detect a single internal loop, and the presence of two of such loops was revealed by cleavages generated in one strand only. All bulges larger than a single-nucleotide were mapped by both types of metal ions and two of the eight single-nucleotide bulges escaped detection by both ions. Of the 14 mismatches present in the proposed precursor structures, as many as 13 were detected by the Ca2+ ions and 10 by Mg2+ (Fig. 1). In sum, 44 of the 47 distinct structure motifs were detected by both metal ions. This compares favorably with only 12 of the 47 such motifs detected by nucleases. Importantly, in 8 of the 10 investigated transcripts the experimentally determined structures of miRNA precursors turned out to be different from those predicted to be the most favorable. In seven transcripts (pre-let-7c, pre-let-7f-2, pre-miR-15a, pre-miR-16-1, pre-miR-18, pre-miR-25, and pre-miR-29a) the hairpin terminal loop regions were different (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2). The differences included the size and localization of terminal loops and accompanying changes in the neighboring stem regions. For example, in the pre-miR-18 the nucleotides G30-C54 form a 5-nucleotide terminal loop, a 4-nucleotide symmetric internal loop, and a 3-nucleotide bulge at the 3′-side of the stem. In the predicted structure there is a 6-nucleotide terminal loop, a 6-nucleotide asymmetric internal loop, and a 1-nucleotide bulge at the 5′-side of the stem. It is also worth noting, that in the case of eight precursors none of the experimentally determined structures were computer-predicted within the 10% range of the suboptimality parameter. Thus, only the structures of pre-miR-29a and pre-miR-30a predicted by mfold to be the most stable were confirmed by the experiment. Duplex Portions of MicroRNA Precursors Show Polarity in Their Reactivity and Thermodynamic Stability—Having established the secondary structures of the investigated precursors we intended to gain an insight into the features of their helical portions. We applied for this purpose the ribonuclease V1, which cleavages were expected to be sensitive to distortions in helical conformation. We also used the Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions, which are more reactive than Ca2+ and Mg2+ and in addition the single-stranded regions should also cleave the flexible portions of duplexes. Finally, we used the thermodynamic profiling of the precursor structures to show how the structure probing and structure stability data corresponded to each other. The ribonuclease V1 cleavages occurred only at the 5′-side of the hairpin stem in 4 of 10 analyzed precursors, pre-let-7c, pre-let-7f-2, pre-miR-29a, and pre-miR-30a. In the remaining six precursors, several much weaker 3′-side cleavages also occurred (not shown). When the sites of V1 cuts were compared with the experimentally determined secondary structures of the precursors, the highly variable patterns emerged (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4). The number of reactive bonds was generally higher than that of the resistant ones, and several very strong cuts were typically observed in each transcript. Both duplexes composed of standard W-C base pairs and G-U wobble pairs only (e.g. in pre-miR-17 and pre-mir-15a) as well as duplexes containing some internal mismatches (e.g. in pre-let-7c and pre-miR-25) were digested. This may suggest that the distortions of helical structures in the latter are rather modest. The strongest V1 cuts frequently occur in investigated transcripts at the sites of increased sequence regularity such as mono-(GGG, UUU, UUUU, AAA), di-, or trinucleotide repeats (UGUG, UAUA, CACA, CUCU, AAUAAU), which are likely to be also the sites of more regular structure. The V1-resistant regions, other than the 4–6 internucleotide bonds from the 5′ terminus, typically occur in the neighborhood of duplex structure distortions such as some bulges, internal loops, and the U-C mismatches. With regard to the barely known sequence specificity of ribonuclease V1 it is interesting to note that the enzyme prefers to cleave the phosphodiester bonds at weak A-U, U-A, and wobble U-G pairs. Of the 12 strong cleavages taking place after the A residue, the GC or GU sequences are always located 5′ to the cleavage site. Next, we used the Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions to reveal in which parts of the pre-miRNA stem structures the phosphodiester bonds are more flexible than in others. We wanted to find out how the distribution of reactive regions in duplexes corresponds to the location of miRNA ends when they are still embedded in the precursor hairpin structure? As expected, the Pb2+ and Mn2+ ions mapped also the phosphodiester bonds of several paired nucleotides located in the neighborhood of bulges or internal loops (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4). In several precursors the region of the miRNA 5′-end is more susceptible to cleavages than that of their 3′-end. For example, in the pre-miR-19a the nucleotides U50-G51 of the miRNA 5′-end are localized in the 3-nt bulge, but a longer stretch of nucleotides U49-C54 shows an increased susceptibility to cleavage. On the other hand, the region of the miR-19a 3′-end is poorly cleaved by the Mn2+ and Pb2+ ions. What is noteworthy is that the regions of enhanced reactivity occur also in the central portions of sequences corresponding to the mature miRNAs. Although these regions correlate with the localization"
https://openalex.org/W2054649531,"Heparanase is a mammalian endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate (HS) at specific intrachain sites, an activity that is strongly implicated in cell dissemination associated with metastasis and inflammation. In addition to its structural role in extracellular matrix assembly and integrity, HS sequesters a multitude of polypeptides that reside in the extracellular matrix as a reservoir. A variety of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes can be released by heparanase activity and profoundly affect cell and tissue function. Thus, heparanase bioavailability, accessibility, and activity should be kept tightly regulated. We provide evidence that HS is not only a substrate for, but also a regulator of, heparanase. Addition of heparin or xylosides to cell cultures resulted in a pronounced accumulation of, heparanase in the culture medium, whereas sodium chlorate had no such effect. Moreover, cellular uptake of heparanase was markedly reduced in HS-deficient CHO-745 mutant cells, heparan sulfate proteoglycan-deficient HT-29 colon cancer cells, and heparinase-treated cells. We also studied the heparanase biosynthetic route and found that the half-life of the active enzyme is ∼30 h. This and previous localization studies suggest that heparanase resides in the endosomal/lysosomal compartment for a relatively long period of time and is likely to play a role in the normal turnover of HS. Co-localization studies and cell fractionation following heparanase addition have identified syndecan family members as candidate molecules responsible for heparanase uptake, providing an efficient mechanism that limits extracellular accumulation and function of heparanase.

In addition to its intimate involvement in the egress of cells from the blood stream, heparanase activity may release a multitude of HS-bound, extracellular matrix-resident growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and enzymes that might profoundly affect cell and tissue function (1Vlodavsky I.

Mechanisms that dictate heparanase regulation are only poorly understood, but are expected to operate at several distinct levels. Induced heparanase expression under pathological conditions suggests a transcriptional regulation. Heparanase gene expression has been shown to involve promoter methylation (22Shteper P.J. Zcharia E.

Regulation at the post-translational level, viz. heparanase processing, cellular localization, and secretion, has also been implicated as a major regulatory mechanism (27Fairbanks M.B. Mildner A.M.

Eldor A. Yacoby-Zeevi O. Zamir E. Pecker I. Ilan N. Geiger B. Vlodavsky I. Katz B.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 115: 2179-2187Google Scholar) as well as with tumor-derived cells (32Zetser A. Levy-Adam F.

The role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in heparanase uptake has not been studied in detail. Here, we provide evidence that the addition of heparin to cell cultures results in a pronounced accumulation of heparanase in the culture medium, whereas treatment with sodium chlorate had no such effect. Moreover, cellular uptake of heparanase was markedly reduced in HS-deficient CHO-745 cells, HSPG-deficient HT-29 cells, and heparinase-treated cells. We also studied the heparanase biosynthetic route and estimated the half-life of the active enzyme to be ∼30 h. Co-localization and cell fractionation studies following heparanase addition have identified syndecans, rather than glypicans, as candidate HSPGs responsible for heparanase uptake.

Transfection proceeded for 48 h, followed by selection with Zeocin for 2 weeks. Stable transfectant pools were further expanded and analyzed. Immunoblotting, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of heparin or chlorate for 24 h under serum-free conditions.

Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of protein and the equivalent volume of medium were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with the appropriate antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) (30Levy-Adam F.

Metabolic labeling was performed essentially as described (32Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitsky S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cell cultures were methionine-starved for 30 min prior to the addition of 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were pulsed for 20 min and chased for the indicated time periods in 1 ml of complete growth medium containing excess unlabeled methionine and the indicated concentrations of heparin or chlorate. For immunoprecipitation, equal volumes (0.1 ml) or equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable cpm of cell lysates and medium samples were brought to a volume of 1 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (buffer A) and incubated with anti-heparanase monoclonal antibody 130 or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added for an additional 30 min. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with buffer A supplemented with 300 mm NaCl and 5% sucrose and once with buffer A. Sample buffer was then added, and after boiling at 100 °C for 5 min, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. Gels were fixed for 30 min in 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid and fluorographed for 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) before drying and autoradiography. Cell Fractionation—Isolation of plasma membrane and endosomal/lysosomal cell fractions was carried out essentially as described (37Schroter C.J. Braun M. Englert J. Beck H. Schmid H. Kalbacher H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 227: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (3 × 108) were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), suspended in 2 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris acetic acid (pH 7.0) supplemented with 250 mm sucrose), and homogenized in a 5-ml Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 2 min to pellet a fraction enriched with plasma membranes. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min to sediment endosomes and lysosomes. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% deoxycholate-containing lysis buffer and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. Heparanase Purification and Uptake Studies—The latent Myc-tagged 65-kDa heparanase precursor was purified from the culture medium of heparanase-transfected HEK-293 cells essentially as described (33Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). For uptake studies, the 65-kDa heparanase precursor was added to confluent cell cultures at a concentration of 1 μg/ml under serum-free conditions. At the indicated time points, the medium was aspirated; cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS; and total cell lysates were prepared as described above. Heparanase uptake and processing were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-heparanase (1453) or anti-Myc tag antibody. Immunocytochemistry—Human U87 glioma cells were left untreated or were incubated with exogenously added 65-kDa heparanase (10 μg/ml) for 15 min and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence staining essentially as described (32Zetser A. Levy-Adam F. Kaplan V. Gingis-Velitsky S. Bashenko Y. Schubert S. Flugelman M.Y. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 33Zetser A. Bashenko Y. Miao H.-Q. Vlodavsky I. Ilan N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7733-7741PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a 2-h incubation with the indicated primary antibodies. Cells were washed extensively with PBS, incubated with the relevant (Cy2/Cy3-conjugated) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h, washed, and mounted (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Heparin, but Not Sodium Chlorate, Enhances Heparanase Accumulation in Cell Culture Medium—To explore the role of cell membrane HS in heparanase uptake, heparanase-transfected cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of heparin, and accumulation of the enzyme in the culture medium was evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, A-D, upper panels) with anti-heparanase (C and D) or anti-Myc (A and B) antibodies. Addition of heparin (1-50 μg/ml) resulted in a marked dose-dependent accumulation of heparanase in the culture medium of 293 (Fig. 1A), MDA-435 (Fig. 1B), C6 (Fig. 1C), and U87 (Fig. 1D) cells. In contrast with 293 cells, heparanase was not detected in the culture medium of untreated MDA-435, C6, and U87 cells, and heparin at concentrations of 5 μg/ml or higher was required for heparanase accumulation in the culture medium. Heparin had no effect on the levels of the 65-kDa heparanase in the cell lysates (Fig. 1, A-D, upper panels, Lysate). These results suggest that heparanase, secreted by each of the cell lines, rapidly interacts with membranous HSPGs, which is presumably followed by uptake and internalization (see below) and is competed by the addition of heparin. Interaction of a multitude of molecules with HS is determined by the sequence and sulfation level of the sugar moieties (38Esko J.D. Curr. Opin.

Interestingly, pretreatment with sodium chlorate at concentrations up to 50 mm had no effect on heparanase accumulation in the culture medium of all cell lines examined (Fig. 1, A-D, lower panels). Heparanase could not be detected in the culture medium of the other cell lines, unlike 293 cells, regardless of chlorate pretreatment. The effect of heparin and chlorate on extracellular heparanase accumulation was next evaluated by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation analysis. C6 (Fig. 1E, upper panel) and 293 (lower panel) cells were pulsed for 20 min with [35S]methionine, followed by a 2-h incubation without or with heparin (1-5 μg/ml), chlorate (50 mm), or both. Medium samples were then collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-heparanase (Fig. 1E, upper panel) or anti-Myc (lower panel) antibody. Heparanase was readily detected in the medium of untreated 293 cells, and the addition of heparin resulted in further accumulation of the de novo synthesized heparanase. Chlorate treatment had no effect on heparanase accumulation, and the combination of heparin and chlorate was as effective as heparin alone (Fig. 1E, lower panel). Similar qualitative results were obtained with C6 glioma cells (Fig. 1E, upper panel), in agreement with the immunoblotting results (Fig. 1C). Chlorate at a concentration of 50 mm has been shown to inhibit overall O-sulfation by 70%, whereas N-sulfation remains unchanged in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (40Safaiyan F. Kolset S.O. Prydz K. Gottfridsson E. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36267-36273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This suggests that O-sulfation is not involved in HS-heparanase interaction, yet N-sulfation may still be necessary. To test this possibility, heparanase-transfected 293 cells were incubated with chemically modified heparin that was totally N-desulfated, followed by N-acetylation. Modified heparin lacking 2-O-sulfation was also examined for its ability to bind heparanase. Indeed, N-desulfated heparin lost its ability to bind heparanase as revealed by the low levels of heparanase accumulated in the culture medium (Fig. 1F, N-Ac). In contrast, 2-O-desulfated heparin was as efficient as unmodified heparin, further suggesting that N-sulfation is necessary for the interaction of HS with heparanase. Moreover, the addition of 4-methylumbelliferyl 7-β-d-xyloside, a xyloside that substitutes for the linker moiety to the proteoglycan core protein and thus functions as a soluble primer for glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, resulted in accumulation of heparanase in the culture medium of 293 cells (Fig. 1G), mimicking the effect of heparin. Reduced Heparanase Uptake by HS-deficient Cells—Next, we examined the uptake of heparanase by HS-deficient cells. To this end, the Myc-tagged 65-kDa heparanase precursor was exogenously added to the culture medium, and uptake was analyzed by immunoblotting. Heparanase binding to wild-type CHO-K1 cells was rapid and appeared maximal by 15 min, followed by a gradual decrease (Fig. 2A, left panels, K1). Interestingly, the anti-Myc tag antibody detected only a single protein band that corresponded in its molecular mass to the added 65-kDa heparanase precursor (Fig. 2A, upper left panel, K1). Heparanase processing into the 50-kDa active enzyme was clearly detected by the anti-heparanase 1453 antibody (Fig. 2A, middle left panel, K1), suggesting that the heparanase C terminus was subjected to processing that removed the Myc tag sequence. Heparanase processing at the C terminus has not been reported so far. A marked decrease in heparanase binding and uptake was observed upon its addition to HS-deficient CHO-745 cells (Fig. 2A, upper and middle left panels, 745). The requirement of HS for efficient heparanase uptake was confirmed using the human HT-29 colon carcinoma cell line (also known as WiDr), reported to express perlecan, a secreted HSPG found mainly in the extracellular matrix, but no other HSPG (42Fuki I.V. Iozzo R.V. Williams K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25742-25750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Heparanase uptake by the HT-29 cells was markedly attenuated (Fig. 2A, upper and middle right panels, HT29) and was similar in magnitude to that by the CHO-745 cells, further confirming the involvement of cell-surface HS in heparanase uptake. Similarly, pretreatment of CHO-K1 cells with bacterial heparinase I resulted in reduced heparanase binding and uptake (Fig. 2B). In contrast with the rapid heparanase uptake observed with CHO-K1 cells at 37 °C (Fig. 2, A, K1; and B, upper left panel, Control), binding at 4 °C was time-dependent and appeared maximal by 60 min (Fig. 2B, middle left panel, Control). Under these conditions, heparanase binding (4 °C) and uptake (37 °C) were barely detected in the heparinase-treated cells (Fig. 2B, upper and middle left panels, Heparinase I). In contrast, pretreatment with chondroitinase ABC had no effect on heparanase binding and uptake (Fig. 2B, right panels, ABC), supporting the specificity of the HS-heparanase interaction. The pronounced decrease in heparanase uptake by HS-deficient cells (Fig. 2A, left panels, 745; and right panels, HT29) rationalizes that heparanase expression by these cells"

Although MT1-MMP exhibits type I collagenolytic but poor gelatinolytic activities, MMP-2 is a potent gelatinase with weak type I collagenolytic behavior. Recombinant linker/hemopexin C domain (LCD) of MT1-MMP binds native type I collagen, blocks MT1-MMP collagenolytic activity in trans, and by circular dichroism spectroscopy, induces localized structural perturbation in the collagen. These changes were reflected by enhanced cleavage of the MT1-LCD-bound collagen by the collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-8 but not by trypsin or MMP-7. Thus, the MT1-LCD alone can initiate triple helicase activity. In contrast, the native and denatured collagen binding properties of MMP-2 reside in the fibronectin type II modules, accordingly termed the collagen binding domain (CBD). Recombinant CBD (but not the MMP-2 LCD) also changed the circular dichroism spectra leading to increased MMP-1 and -8 cleavage of native collagen. However, recombinant CBD reduced gelatin and collagen cleavage by MMP-2 in trans as did CBD23, which comprises the second and third fibronectin type II modules, but not the CBD23 mutant W316A/W374A, which neither binds gelatin nor collagen. This indicates that MMP-2 and MT1-MMP bind collagen at a different site than MMP-1 and MMP-8. Thus, MMP-2 utilizes the CBD in cis for collagen binding and triple helicase activity, which compensates for the lack of collagen binding by the MMP-2 LCD. Hence, the MMP family has evolved two distinct mechanisms for collagen triple helicase activity using two structurally distinct domains, with triple helicase activity occurring independent of α-chain hydrolysis.

The extracellular matrix provides all tissues and organs with form, mechanical strength, and physical properties. In addition, the extracellular matrix provides self-reporting dynamic feedback to the resident cells upon alterations in tissue integrity, infiltration of nonresident pathological or host defense cells, and pathological processes. This occurs in response to degraded matrix components revealing cryptic motifs; to released or activated signaling molecules otherwise sequestered by the matrix; or to liberated neoproteins generated by proteolytic processing. Of the fibrillar collagens that provide most of the mechanical strength to mineralized and nonmineralized tissues, type I collagen is the most abundant and important (1Kadler K. Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril Forming Collagens. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar). Type I collagen is also a reservoir for and regulator of cytokine release (2Di Lullo G.A. Sweeney S.M.

Hence, connective tissue remodeling and collagen metabolism in particular, is an important aspect of normal tissue and organ homeostasis. Indeed, in many pathologies the normal balance of connective tissue synthesis and degradation is perturbed leading to altered tissue and organ function due either to loss of collagen or to the destructive effects of fibrosis (6Byers P.H.

Thus, it is critical to elucidate the molecular basis of collagen homeostasis and catabolism as fundamental aspects in the understanding of human disease. In turn, this knowledge is needed to devise new therapeutic strategies to modulate collagen degradation and the effects of connective tissue destruction in many diseases. Monomeric type I collagen, which consists of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain interwound into a triple helix, is axially polymerized to form supermolecular microfibrils and higher order structural fibrils (1Kadler K. Extracellular Matrix 1: Fibril Forming Collagens. Academic Press, London1994Google Scholar). Collagen cross-linkage (9Knott L. Bailey A.J. Bone. 1998; 22: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) further leads to the formation of mechanically strong and proteolytically resistant collagen fibers arranged in different arrays according to the nature and demands of nonmineralized and mineralized tissues. At neutral pH, non-mineralized type I collagen is believed to be cleaved extracellularly by collagenases of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT, membrane type; s, recombinant soluble form of MT1-MMP lacking the stem, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; CBD, collagen binding domain; LCD, linker/hemopexin C domain; N-MMP, recombinant MMP expressed without the hemopexin C domain; CD, circular dichroism; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT, membrane type; s, recombinant soluble form of MT1-MMP lacking the stem, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; CBD, collagen binding domain; LCD, linker/hemopexin C domain; N-MMP, recombinant MMP expressed without the hemopexin C domain; CD, circular dichroism; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. family (10Visse R.

In our recent study we reported the critical role of the hemopexin C domain and linker of MT1-MMP in collagen recognition, cleavage and in blocking MT1-MMP and MMP-2 collagenolysis when present as a recombinant domain or natural autolysis product on the cell surface (5Tam E.M.

In the present report, using circular dichroism spectroscopy we demonstrate for the first time that the MT1-MMP linker hemopexin C domain and MMP-2 CBD fibronectin type II modules perturb the secondary structure of native type I collagen upon binding. Hence, triple helicase activity is an independent event and separable from collagen α-chain scission. Although this specific interaction cooperatively increased the rate of collagen cleavage by the collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-8 it was not sufficient to allow for collagen cleavage by the noncollagenolytic proteases MMP-7 and trypsin. However, despite the lack of collagen binding by the MMP-2 hemopexin C domain, it was still absolutely required, together with the fibronectin type II modules, for native type I collagen cleavage.

Human MMP-1 was expressed and purified using the pGWIGH vector kindly provided by British Biotech Pharmaceuticals (Oxford, UK). Expression of C-terminally Truncated MMP-2—The following primers: 5′ (GCTCTATGGGGCCTGACCTGACATTGACCTTGGC) and 3′ (GCCAAGGTCAATGTCAGGTCAGGCCCCATAGAGC) (target bases are underlined) were used to introduce a STOP codon in proMMP-2 (template pGLA/pGWIGH) to create a truncated form, N-MMP-2, which lacks the hemopexin C domain (Δ446-660). The entire DNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing and stable CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell clones were selected using mycophenolic acid as previously described (46Morrison C.J. Butler G.S.

Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Roller bottle cultures (850 cm2, BD Biosciences) were incubated in 50-100 ml serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFMII, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) and harvested every 1-2 days for up to 10 days. NMMP-2 was purified as follows: filtered conditioned medium was passed through 10-15 ml of gelatin-Sepharose 4B equilibrated with column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.025% sodium azide, 0.04% Brij 35). After washing with column buffer including 1 m NaCl, bound proteins were eluted with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed into column buffer, and passed through a 4-ml column of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B to remove full-length hamster MMP-2. The flow-through was loaded onto a small gelatin-Sepharose 4B column (2 ml) and washed and eluted as before. Peak fractions were dialyzed in storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl). Circular Dichroism—Collagen and recombinant protein domains were incubated either alone or in combination for 2 h at 28 °C. Samples were transferred to a 1-mm path-length quartz cell and ellipticity (mdeg) was measured from 197 nm to 250 nm using a J810 (Jasco) spectropolarimeter at 28 °C. The CD spectra of native collagen alone were also determined at various temperatures maintained by a computer-controlled Neslab water bath thermal jacket during thermal denaturation. Ellipticity values were averaged between triplicates and plotted against wavelength. CD spectra were measured for proteins alone: native collagen, MT1-LCD, MT1-CD, MMP-2 CBD, MMP-2 LCD, and as mixtures of native collagen with the individual recombinant protein domains. Calculated CD spectra were produced by summing the ellipticity values for collagen and the recombinant domains alone (47Chien C.Y. Xu Y. Xiao R. Aramini J.M. Sahasrabudhe P.V. Krug R.M. Montelione G.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1950-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and compared with the measured CD spectra of the corresponding collagen/recombinant domain mixtures to assess the extent of perturbations in collagen secondary structure. Enzyme Assays—Biotin-labeled type I collagen (0.025 pmol) was incubated with MMPs in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 3.8 mm NaN3, 0.05% Brij) for 18 h at 28 °C (5Tam E.M.

MMPs were activated with 2 mm APMA for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of substrate. Recombinant protein domains were added for the duration of the assay at various mol ratios of protein:enzyme as indicated. Collagenase assays were terminated with the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.0% SDS, 2.0 m urea, 0.05% bromphenol blue) and then analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using either streptavidin-HRP and ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) or infrared dye labeled-streptavidin (Molecular Probes) and detection using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) at 700 nm. Quenched fluorescent substrates Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (48Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) and fluorescein-labeled gelatin (DQ gelatin, Molecular Probes) were incubated with APMA-activated MMP-2 in assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij) for 1-2 h at 37 °C. Recombinant MMP domains were added for the duration of the experiment as indicated. Fluorescence was measured using the POLARstar Optima (BMG Labtechnologies) using excitation and emission filters of 320 nm and 405 nm for the Mca-labeled peptide, and 485 nm and 520 nm for DQ gelatin. Substrate cleavage was monitored and reported as arbitrary fluorescence units (units s-1 nm-1). Metabolically labeled 14C-human type I gelatin (19Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was incubated with MMP-2 for 3 h in assay buffer in the presence of MMP-2 LCD, 5% Me2SO, or increasing amounts of CBD. Digestion was terminated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid/1% tannic acid at 0 °C. The radioactivity of degraded gelatin peptides in the supernatant was counted by scintillation spectroscopy with quench correction. We have previously shown that the hemopexin C domain of MT1-MMP binds and is required for native collagen cleavage (5Tam E.M. Wu Y.I. Butler G.S. Stack M.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39005-39014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that upon native collagen binding the MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain prepares the collagen for cleavage by localized disruption of the triple helix in the immediate vicinity of the Gly775-Ile/Leu776 cleavage site. To test this, saturating amounts of recombinant MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain with or without the linker (Fig. 1A, inset) were incubated with native type I collagen and changes in protein secondary structure were measured using CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1A, left panel, a deviation in the spectra was observed in the 199-205 nm region for the collagen/MT1-LCD sample where the measured minimum (203 nm, -45.1 mdeg) was shallower and occurred at a longer wavelength than that of the calculated minimum (202 nm, -48.7 mdeg). Similar spectral changes also occurred upon heat denaturation of native collagen (Fig. 1B). These structural changes were not seen in the collagen/MT1-CD sample (Fig. 1A,right panel) and so are consistent with the inability of MT1-CD compared with MT1-LCD to block MT1-MMP cleavage of collagen (5Tam E.M. Wu Y.I. Butler G.S. Stack M.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39005-39014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus these experiments indicate that there are different modes or sites of collagen binding for recombinant MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain with or without the linker. Given the importance of the hemopexin C domain in MT1-MMP collagenolysis (5Tam E.M. Wu Y.I. Butler G.S. Stack M.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39005-39014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), collagen helix perturbation induced by the linker and hemopexin C domain components of full-length MT1-MMP is likely to be an essential component of the triple helicase mechanism. Although the deviation between the measured and calculated spectra predicts a change in protein secondary structure of the collagen/MT1-LCD complex, it does not distinguish in which protein the change occurred. However, the similarity with the change in CD spectra of native collagen upon mild heat denaturation (Fig. 1B) suggests, but does not conclusively show, that the structural alteration originated from or led to perturbations in the structure of collagen. Therefore, as a further indication that the changes occurred in the collagen, we examined its susceptibility to cleavage by two secreted collagenases in the presence of MT1-LCD (Fig. 1C). The absence of collagen degradation by trypsin alone, even at a ratio of 1:10 (enzyme to substrate), confirmed the native structure of the type I collagen in these assays (Fig. 1D). Whereas MT1-MMP activity was blocked by the addition of MT1-LCD (Fig. 1D) as we recently reported (5Tam E.M. Wu Y.I. Butler G.S. Stack M.S. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39005-39014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the addition of MT1-LCD unexpectedly enhanced collagen cleavage by MMP-1 and MMP-8. This occurred even at low MT1-LCD:enzyme (0.1) mol ratios (Fig. 1C) in a concentration-dependent manner and was particularly apparent when MMP-1 and MMP-8 were incubated at enzyme/substrate ratios that produced minimal cleavage as shown. Hence, the localized disruption of the collagen triple helix by recombinant MT1-LCD rendered it more amendable to cleavage by MMP-1 and -8 in trans in a cooperative manner and shows that triple helicase and cleavage activities are independent, separable events. In the full-length MT1-MMP, a similar action of the linker and hemopexin C domain in cis is likely the mechanism of triple helicase activity of MT1-MMP. However, when in trans the MT1-LCD blocks MT1-MMP collagen cleavage indicating that the MMP-1 and MMP-8 hemopexin C domains utilize a different binding site which does not compete with MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain binding. The molecular requirements and domain interactions for MMP-2 cleavage of collagen are not clear. Using recombinant proteins"
https://openalex.org/W2112114655,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, is released from cells by proteolytic cleavage of a membrane-anchored precursor. The TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE; adisintegrin and metalloprotease17; ADAM17) is known to have a key role in the ectodomain shedding of TNFα in several cell types. However, because purified ADAMs 9, 10, and 19 can also cleave a peptide corresponding to the TNFα cleavage site in vitro, these enzymes are considered to be candidate TNFα sheddases as well. In this study we used cells lacking ADAMs 9, 10, 17 (TACE), or 19 to address the relative contribution of these ADAMs to TNFα shedding in cell-based assays. Our results corroborate that ADAM17, but not ADAM9, -10, or -19, is critical for phorbol ester- and pervanadate-stimulated release of TNFα in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. However, overexpression of ADAM19 increased the constitutive release of TNFα, whereas overexpression of ADAM9 or ADAM10 did not. This suggests that ADAM19 may contribute to TNFα shedding, especially in cells or tissues where it is highly expressed. Furthermore, we used mutagenesis of TNFα to explore which domains are important for its stimulated processing by ADAM17. We found that the cleavage site of TNFα is necessary and sufficient for cleavage by ADAM17. In addition, the ectodomain of TNFα makes an unexpected contribution to the selective cleavage of TNFα by ADAM17: it prevents one or more other enzymes from cleaving TNFα following PMA stimulation. Thus, selective stimulated processing of TNFα by ADAM17 in cells depends on the presence of an appropriate cleavage site as well as the inhibitory role of the TNF ectodomain toward other enzymes that can process this site.

Because of the critical role of TNFα in rheumatoid arthritis, considerable efforts have been made to identify the TNFα convertase.

Besides ADAM17, additional candidate TNFα convertases have emerged from biochemical studies. ADAM10, which is most closely related to ADAM17, also can cleave a TNFα peptide at the physiological cleavage site in vitro (see Table I and Ref. 19Rosendahl M.S. Ko S.C. Long D.L. Brewer M.T.

Furthermore, the TNFα cleavage site peptide can be processed by recombinant soluble forms of ADAMs 9 and 19 in vitro, although the cleavage sites for these ADAMs do not match the physiologically relevant site (see Table I and Refs. 20Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol.

MMP7/matrilysin is critical for TNFα shedding in a mouse model for resorption of herniated discs (22Haro H. Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Shinomiya K. Spengler D.M. Matrisian L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), whereas the serine protease PR3 can release TNFα under conditions where it is highly expressed, such as in acute local inflammatory processes (23Coeshott C. Ohnemus C. Pilyavskaya A. Ross S. Wieczorek M. Kroona H. Leimer A.H. Cheronis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To address this question, we evaluated TNFα shedding in cells isolated from wild-type, adam9-/-, adam10-/-, adam17-/-, and adam19-/-mice. In addition, we overexpressed different ADAMs to test which one(s) is(are) capable of processing pro-TNFα in cell-based assays. Our results confirmed that ADAM17 is the major stimulated sheddase of TNFα, at least in mouse embryonic cells. In addition, we found that ADAM19 is also able to cleave TNFα and may therefore contribute to TNFα shedding in cells. Finally, we addressed the requirements for cleavage of TNFα by ADAM17 through testing how mutations in TNFα affect its shedding by ADAM17. These studies revealed that an inhibitory function of the TNFα module toward other enzymes contributes to the selective role of ADAM17 in stimulated cleavage of TNFα.

Becherer (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). Expression Vectors—The pAP-TNFα and pAP-TRN (TRANCE) expression constructs have been described previously (21Chesneau V. Becherer D. Zheng Y.

In both constructs, an alkaline phosphatase moiety is attached to the C terminus of the full-length wild-type protein. To generate pAP-ΔTNFα, a PCR fragment encoding the amino acids 1–87 of TNFα was cloned into pAPtag5 vector (Genehunter Corp.) between the NheI and BglII sites. The resulting mutant form of TNFα lacks the ectodomain but contains the juxtamembrane domain, including the cleavage site for ADAM17. The pAP-TNF-Ecto (TRN) construct encodes a chimeric molecule in which the ectodomain of TNFα is replaced with that of TRANCE/OPGL.

The pAP-ΔTNF-Ins (TRN) was generated by inserting PCR fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domain of TNFα (amino acid residues 1–53), the membrane-proximal juxtamembrane domain of TRANCE (amino acid residues 72–115), followed by the juxtamembrane domain of TNFα (amino acid residues 54–87) into pAPtag5.

Cells seeded in six-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) were transfected with the appropriate expression plasmids using LipofetcAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). The transfection solution was removed after 5 h, and cells were allowed to recover in complete medium overnight. To measure shedding of the introduced AP-fusion proteins under basal conditions, cells were washed once with PBS, and then cultured in Opti-Mem for 1 h. The Opti-Mem medium was collected and replaced with fresh Opti-Mem medium with 25 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or 100 μm pervanadate (PV), or 1 μm of the hydroxamic acid-type metalloprotease inhibitor batimastat (BB94) at the indicated concentration for another hour to assess shedding under stimulated or inhibited conditions. The change in ectodomain shedding upon addition of each activator or inhibitor of shedding was analyzed as described previously (15Sahin U. Weskamp G. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J.J.

Finally, bafilomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar type H+ ATPase that prevents acidification of the lysosome, was added to cells to assess what role lysosomal protein degradation has in generating C-terminal stubs in cells expressing TNFα or ΔTNFα. After CHO cells were transfected with either TNFα or ΔTNFα and had recovered overnight, they were incubated with or without 10 μg/ml bafilomycin A1 for 1 h. Then the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer, and the extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis as described below. All experiments were repeated at least three times with very similar results. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitations—To prepare samples for Western blot analysis, transfected cells were washed with PBS, then lysed in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) per well. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min then incubated with concanavalin A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing twice with cell lysis buffer and once with PBS, the beads were incubated with 2× sample loading buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, incubated with antibodies against ADAM9 (28Weskamp G. Krätzschmar J.R. Reid M. Blobel C.P. J.

After washing twice with cell lysis buffer and once with PBS, the beads were incubated with 2× sample loading buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol at 95 °C for 5 min.

TNFα Shedding in Cells Lacking Candidate ADAM Sheddases—To address whether ADAMs 9, 10, or 19 make a significant or at least detectable contribution to the ectodomain shedding of TNFα in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we compared TNFα shedding in cells derived from wild-type mice and mice lacking ADAMs 9, 10, 17, or 19 (12Peschon J.J.

As shown in Fig. 1A, TNFα was shed constitutively in wild-type primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts mEFs, and its release could be stimulated by addition of either 25 ng/ml PMA or 100 μm pervanadate (PV). When constitutive and stimulated TNFα shedding was assessed in adam9-/-, adam10-/-, and adam19-/-cells, no difference compared with wild-type mEF was observed (Fig. 1A). Thus ADAMs 9, 10, and 19 are dispensable for the constitutive or stimulated shedding of TNFα in mouse embryonic cells, even though all three ADAMs are expressed in these cells (15Sahin U. Weskamp G.

On the other hand, PMA-stimulated TNFα shedding was abolished, and PV-stimulated shedding was strongly reduced in adam17-/- mEF (Fig. 1B). Both PMA- and PV-stimulated shedding could be rescued by reintroduction of ADAM17 cDNA into adam17-/- mEFs (Fig. 1B). These findings confirm that ADAM17 has a critical role in PMA- and PV-stimulated shedding of TNFα in mEF cells. Interestingly, constitutive TNFα shedding was still observed in adam17-/- mEFs, although it was slightly increased after reintroduction of wild-type ADAM17 cDNA (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that ADAM17 as well as one or more other minor TNFα sheddases contribute to constitutive shedding of TNFα Effects of Overexpression of ADAMs 9, 10, 17, and 19 on TNFα Shedding—Although ADAMs 9, 10, and 19 are not essential for constitutive or stimulated shedding of TNFα in mEF cells, one or more of these ADAMs could conceivably contribute to shedding of TNFα, especially in cells or tissues where they are highly expressed. To address this possibility, we tested whether overexpression of ADAMs 9, 10, 17, or 19 enhances constitutive or stimulated TNFα shedding in either CHO cells, COS-7 cells, or in adam10-/- or adam17-/-embryonic cells. When TNFα was co-expressed with wild-type ADAM9 in CHO or COS-7 cells, no change in its constitutive or stimulated shedding was observed in comparison to control experiments with the inactive mutant form ADAM9E>A (Fig. 2, A and B, COS-7 cell data not shown). When ADAM19 was co-expressed with TNFα in COS-7 or CHO cells, this led to an increased constitutive shedding of TNFα, whereas co-expression with the catalytically inactive ADAM19E>A did not (Fig. 2, A and B). Separate Western blot experiments confirmed that the wild-type and E>A mutant forms of ADAM9 as well as of ADAM19 were expressed at comparable levels in these experiments (data not shown). Interestingly, constitutive and stimulated shedding of TNFα was not noticeably increased when ADAM17 was co-expressed in CHO or COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Because the contribution of ADAM19 and other ADAMs to stimulated shedding may be obscured by the activity of ADAM17 in COS-7 and CHO cells, we also performed co-expression experiments of TNFα with different ADAMs in adam17-/- primary mEF and in immortalized adam17-/- mEF cells (referred to as E2 cells). Overexpression of ADAM19 in adam17-/- cells resulted in increased unstimulated shedding of TNFα, yet no additional increase was achieved following stimulation with PMA (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the catalytic activity of ADAM19 is not sensitive to PMA stimulation, which is consistent with a previous study in which ADAM19-dependent cleavage of TRANCE/OPGL was also not stimulated by PMA (29Zhou H.M. Weskamp G. Chesneau V. Sahin U. Vortkamp A. Horiuchi K. Chiusaroli R. Hahn R. Wilkes D. Fisher P. Baron R. Manova K. Basson C.T. Hempstead B.L. Blobel C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As had been seen in CHO and COS-7 cells, overexpression of ADAM9 and ADAM9E>A also did not affect constitutive or stimulated shedding of TNFα in adam17-/- cells (Fig. 2D), even though ADAM9 and ADAM9E>A were expressed at similarly high levels (data not shown). In addition, we did not observe any noticeable increase in constitutive or stimulated shedding of TNFα when we overexpressed ADAM10 in adam17-/- cells (data not shown), which is consistent with the results of a previous study by Reddy et al. (30Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). To further explore a potential role of ADAM10 in TNFα shedding, we repeated a similar experiment in adam10+/- and adam10-/- cells. Shedding of the EGF-receptor ligand betacellulin was used as a positive control for the catalytic activity of ADAM10 (15Sahin U. Weskamp G. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J.J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The upper panel in Fig. 2E shows soluble forms of alkaline-phosphatase-tagged betacellulin in the supernatant of transiently transfected adam10+/- cells. The faster migrating form (marked by an arrow) is generated by ADAM10-dependent shedding: it is not detectable in the supernatant of adam10-/- cells, but is recovered when adam10-/- cells are rescued by co-transfection with wild-type ADAM10. The slower migrating form of betacellulin is presumably generated by an activity that is resistant to metalloprotease inhibitors (15Sahin U. Weskamp G. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J.J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In a parallel experiment, co-expression of ADAM10 with TNFα in adam10-/- cells did not increase constitutive shedding of TNFα compared with adam10-/- cells expressing only TNFα (Fig. 2E, lower panel). Evaluation of the Effect of Mutations in TNFα on Its Processing by ADAM17—Because the studies described above further support the notion that ADAM17 is the major stimulated TNFα sheddase, we set out to learn more about the domains in TNFα that are important for its cleavage by ADAM17. For this purpose, we introduced mutations into the ectodomain of TNFα and generated chimera between TNFα and TRANCE, a TNF family member that is not a substrate for ADAM17 (25Schlöndorff J.S. Lum L. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14665-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In all cases, an alkaline phosphatase moiety was fused to the ectodomain of these type II transmembrane proteins to monitor their shedding. The shedding profile of the chimera lacking the TNFα ectodomain (ΔTNFα) in CHO cells was similar to that of TNFα in that it could be stimulated by addition of PMA or pervanadate (Fig. 3B). In adam17-/- cells, the PMA-stimulat"

However, the way in which β-HIVS induces apoptosis remains to be clarified. In this study, we performed cDNA array analysis and found that β-HIVS suppressed the expression of the gene for tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1), which is a member of the heat-shock family of proteins. When human leukemia HL60 cells and human lung cancer DMS114 cells were treated with β-HIVS, the amount of TRAP1 in mitochondria decreased in a time-dependent manner during apoptosis. A similar reduction in the level of TRAP1 was also observed upon exposure of cells to VP16. Treatment of DMS114 cells with TRAP1-specific siRNA sensitized the cells to β-HIVS-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the reduction in the level of expression of TRAP1 by TRAP1-specific siRNA enhanced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria when DMS114 cells were treated with either β-HIVS or VP16. The suppression of the level of TRAP1 by either β-HIVS or VP16 was blocked by N-acetyl-cysteine, indicating the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the regulation of the expression of TRAP1. These results suggest that suppression of the expression of TRAP1 in mitochondria might play an important role in the induction of apoptosis caused via formation of ROS."

The current study addresses the interdependence of CL and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The CL biosynthetic pathway is well characterized in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The first step catalyzed by phosphatidylglycerolphosphate (PGP) synthase is the synthesis of PGP from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol 3-phosphate (Glc-3-P). PGP phosphatase dephosphorylates PGP to phosphatidylglycerol (PG). In the final step, CL synthase catalyzes the formation of CL from PG and CDP-diacylglycerol (30Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Schlame M. Hostetler K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22398-22403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) shows that CL levels were correlated with mitochondrial development. CL was more abundant in the stationary than logarithmic growth phase and in aerobic versus anaerobic conditions. Respiratory-deficient ρ0 cells had reduced CL. Similar results were obtained by Gaynor et al. (39Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Gallet et al. (40Gallet P.F. Petit J.M. Maftah A. Zachowski A. Julien R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These studies pointed to an important role for CL in mitochondrial biogenesis and suggested that mitochondrial development and CL synthesis may be coordinately regulated. The characterization of purified CL synthase from yeast and mammalian mitochondria showed strong pH dependence of reaction velocity around mitochondrial matrix pH. Schlame and Hostetler (41Schlame M. Hostetler K.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) propose that the trans-membrane pH gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane offered a possible mechanism of regulation. However, this hypothesis was not previously tested. The optimization of methods for quantification of CL enabled us to address the following questions. 1) What is the effect of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly mutants on in vivo CL biosynthesis and steady-state CL levels? 2) What is the effect of mitochondrial trans-membrane electrochemical potential gradient and ATP synthesis on in vivo CL biosynthesis? We carried out pulse-labeling and steady-state labeling experiments that showed that the functional assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes positively regulates in vivo CL biosynthesis. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the trans-membrane pH gradient acts as a regulatory mechanism that controls CL biosynthesis. Glucose, yeast extract, and peptone were purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Galactose, valinomycin, oligomycin, CCCP, and all of the phospholipid standards, phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine, CL, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine, were from Sigma. 32Pi and [α-32P]UTP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 10-N-Nonyl-3,6-bis(dimethylamino)-acridine (NAO) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Zymolyase was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Thin layer chromatography plates (LK5 Silica Gel 150 A) were purchased from Whatman Inc. (Clifton, NJ). Riboprobe system kit was from Promega. Chloroform, ethanol, methanol, glycerol, boric acid, and triethylamine were from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). All of the other chemicals used were reagent grade or better. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—The yeast S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C. Complex medium (YP dextrose) for liquid cultures contained yeast extract (1% w/v), peptone (2% w/v), and glucose (2% w/v). Solid medium contained 2% w/v agar in addition to the above. Glucose was replaced as carbon source by galactose (2%) or ethanol (1%) and glycerol (3%) where indicated. Semi-synthetic medium contained 5 g of(NH4)2SO4,1gofKH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4 7H2O, 0.1 g of NaCl, 0.1 g of CaCl2,5gof peptone, 3.75 g of yeast extract, 20 g of galactose, or 3% glycerol and 1% ethanol per 1 liter of medium. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.8 by 50 mm sodium citrate/sodium phosphate buffer as per Kovac et al. (42Kovac L. Bohmerova E. Butko P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 721: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The respiratory complex assembly mutants were verified for genetic markers and their inability to grow on non-fermentable medium by replica plating on synthetic dropout and YPGE (yeast extract, peptone, 3% glycerol, and 1% ethanol) plates, respectively.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource/referenceW303-1AMAT a, ade2-1, trp1-1, leu2-3, 112, his3-1, 15, ura3-129Zhao M.

(43Gallet P.F. Maftah A. Petit J.M. Denis-Gay M. Julien R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Yeast cells at the indicated growth phase were fixed in cold ethanol (70%) and stored at –20 °C. Fixed cells were washed three times with cold buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7), vortexed vigorously to eliminate aggregates, and counted using a hemocytometer. Yeast cells (0–2.5 × 107) were added to 45 μm NAO and incubated for 15 min at 20 °C. Cells were then centrifuged (3000 × g, 5 min, 20 °C), washed three times in buffer to remove unbound dye, and resuspended in 3 ml of buffer. Red fluorescence emission of NAO bound to yeast cells was measured at 640 nm with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm using a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer (Model F-2000) (emission and excitation bandwidths were set at 10 nm). We observed that NAO did bind to yeast cells in the concentrations reported. However, binding was not specific to CL, because fluorescence emission from CL-deficient crd1Δ cells was similar to that of wild-type cells. Thus, this method was not used for CL quantification. In Vivo Pulse Labeling of Phospholipids—10-ml cultures were pulse-labeled with 32Pi (0.5 mCi) for 15 min. Cells were harvested, washed once with sterile water, and digested with zymolyase (Zymolyase-20T) (2.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-SO4 buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.2 m glycerol and 100 mm sodium thioglycolate) at room temperature for 15 min to yield spheroplasts. Phospholipids were extracted from spheroplasts by 2:1 chloroform/methanol (44Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), partitioned in sterile water, and separated by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (45Leray C. Pelletier X. Hemmendinger S. Cazenave J.P. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 420: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) on LK5 Silica Gel 150 A plates in chloroform/ethanol/water/triethylamine (30/35/7/35, v/v). Phospholipids were identified by co-migration with known standards. 32Pi in individual phospholipids was visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Incorporation of the radiolabel (32Pi) into individual phospholipid is expressed as the percentage of radiolabel incorporated into total phospholipids. Steady-state Phospholipid Determination—Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in YP dextrose or YP galactose media with a starting A550 of 0.1. Immediately after inoculation, cultures were supplemented with 10 μCi of 32Pi ml–1 and allowed to grow for several generations to achieve steady-state labeling as described previously (46Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the indicated growth phase, and spheroplast formation, phospholipid extraction, separation, and quantification were as described above. Treatment with Inhibitors of Oxidative Phosphorylation—Cells were grown in YP galactose or YP glycerol-ethanol media (as indicated) to the mid-logarithmic growth phase. Oligomycin or CCCP was added to a final concentration of 3 and 4.1 μg/ml, respectively (47Epstein C.B. Waddle J.A. Hale W. Dave V. Thornton J. Macatee T.L. Garner H.R. Butow R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). For valinomycin treatment, cells were grown in semi-synthetic medium (42Kovac L. Bohmerova E. Butko P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 721: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with galactose or glycerol-ethanol as carbon source to the early logarithmic growth phase (A550 ≈ 0.8). Valinomycin was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. The time of treatment was 1.5 h for CCCP and 2 h for oligomycin and valinomycin. Cells then were pulse-labeled with 32Pi for phospholipid analysis or harvested for RNA isolation. Estimation of Mitochondrial Matrix pH—FY1679 wild-type and crd1Δ cells were transformed with pH-GFPmito (48Matsuyama S. Llopis J. Deveraux Q.L. Tsien R.Y. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Correct targeting of the pH-GFPmito was verified by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence from cells expressing pH-GFPmito was measured by FACScan (BD Biosciences), and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 50,000 cells was determined (FL1 filter: excitation 480 nm; emission 530 nm). The titration of GFP intensity and pH were carried out by placing cells in the semi-synthetic galactose medium of various pH values (6.5, 7.0, 7.6, and 8.2) containing 10 μm CCCP. The pH estimation was done on cells after treatment with CCCP, oligomycin, and valinomycin as described above, and the data are expressed as relative change in MFI upon treatment with inhibitors compared with control. RNA Analysis—RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction (49Collart M.A. Oliviero S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.12.1-13.12.2Google Scholar), separated on an agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled CRD1 riboprobe followed by a riboprobe for the constitutively expressed gene ACT1 to normalize for loading variation. RNA probes were synthesized using the Promega Riboprobe System. Plasmids used as templates for riboprobe synthesis were pCRD7 (50Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and pPLG (51Anderson M.S. Lopes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26596-26601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These plasmids were linearized upon digestion with HindIII and BamHI, respectively. Riboprobes were synthesized using RNA polymerase T7 for CRD1 and SP6 for ACT1. The results were visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified using ImageQuant software. In Vivo CL Biosynthesis Is Regulated by Carbon Source and Growth Curve—Previous studies have shown that growth phase and carbon source regulate steady-state CL levels (38Jakovcic S. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Gallet P.F. Petit J.M. Maftah A. Zachowski A. Julien R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CL levels are higher in growth medium, which favors mitochondrial biogenesis including YP galactose and non-fermentable medium such as YPGE (38Jakovcic S. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because our mitochondrial respiratory complex assembly mutants and ATP synthase mutants cannot grow in non-fermentable medium, we decided to use fermentable medim with glucose or galactose as carbon source. The aim was to identify growth medium and growth phase in which CL synthesis is maximum, such that quantification of CL is more reliable. As seen in Fig. 1a, the maximum labeling of CL during pulse labeling occurs in the mid-logarithmic phase in YP galactose medium, whereas maximum steady-state labeling of CL occurs in early stationary phase (Fig. 1b). Quantification of CL under these conditions results in a strong CL-specific signal upon radiolabeling. Decreased CL Biosynthesis in Respiratory Chain Assembly Mutants—CL synthesis was measured in respiratory chain and ATP synthase mutant cells grown in YP galactose or YP dextrose medium (Table II). Pulse labeling and steady-state labeling of CL decreased in most of the assembly mutants of complexes III, IV, and V. In pulse-labeling experiments, CL was decreased in all of the mutants with the exception of cox4Δ. Steady-state CL levels decreased in all of the mutants with the exception of cox6Δ in which case CL actually increased slightly in the stationary phase. As expected, in the ρ0 cells, the steady-state CL decreased. In summary, in almost all of the cases, disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP synthase by genetic mutation led to a decrease in biosynthesis and steady-state levels of CL.Table IICardiolipin quantification in respiratory chain complexes III and IV and oxidative phosphorylation complex V assembly mutantsStrainDeletionAffected complexPulse-labeled CLSteady-state CLSteady-state CLMid-log phaseEarly-stationary phase% of controlaW303ΔCOR1cor1ΔIII54.8 ± 3.7140.6 ± 0.7095.48 ± 0.72aW303ΔCOR2cor2ΔIII24.0 ± 0.7443.3 ± 2.4349.57 ± 2.15WD1*cox4ΔIV93.7 ± 9.465.6 ± 8.937.34 ± 1.85aW303ΔCOX6cox6ΔIV74.2 ± 5.79100.5 ± 2.2111.75 ± 2.21JΔ7*cox7ΔIV21.9 ± 8.2141.7 ± 7.042.59 ± 5.97aW303ΔATP10atp10ΔV27.1 ± 2.5949.3 ± 0.8959.82 ± 1.17aW303ΔATP11atp11ΔV33.1 ± 1.7657.5 ± 1.4775.88 ± 1.03aW303ΔATP12atp12ΔV34.0 ± 1.8066.3 ± 1.0172.70 ± 3.19PVY10atp4ΔV43.4 ± 7.3751.3 ± 13.0549.81 ± 4.37aW303ρoMitochondrial DNAIII, IV, and V51.5 ± 2.0556.1 ± 2.4573.01 ± 1.44 Open table in a new tab Effect of Oxidative Phosphorylation Inhibitors on CL Synthesis—The absence of a functional electron transport chain in the respiratory complex assembly mutants leads to a decrease in the trans-membrane pH gradient, trans-membrane electrical gradient, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Any or all of these factors may be responsible for the observed decrease in CL synthesis in these mutants. To determine the role of each of these factors in CL regulation, we perturbed them individually with specific inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, including CCCP, valinomycin, and oligomycin. CCCP disrupts the transmembrane pH gradient by allowing free movement of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This results in a reduced mitochondrial matrix pH. Valinomycin is a K+ ionophore that disrupts the trans-membrane electrical gradient. Oligomycin is an inhibitor of the F0 component of the F0-F1-ATP synthase complex and inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthesis. We observed that CCCP (4.1 μg/ml), oligomycin (3 μg/ml), and valinomycin (5 μg/ml) inhibited the growth of wild-type cells in non-fermentable media (Fig. 2, a and b), suggesting that the concentration of inhibitors used is effective in perturbing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Inhibition was observed after 1.5 h with CCCP treatment and 2 h for oligomycin or valinomycin treatment (Fig. 2, a and b). These inhibitors did not dramatically affect growth in fermentable media (Fig. 2, c and d) in which inhibition was observed much later. Thus, in vivo CL biosynthesis was determined in fermentable medium since inhibitor treatment in non-fermentable medium resulted in growth arrest and inefficient incorporation of the radiolabel. To test the effect of these inhibitors on mitochondrial matrix pH, we used pH-sensitive GFP expressed in mitochondria matrix (pH-GFPmito), which gives higher MFI with increasing pH (Fig. 3a). In FY1679 wild-type cells, the treatment by oligomycin or valinomycin results in a small increase in the GFP intensity, whereas CCCP treatment results in a large drop in the intensity (Fig. 3b). These results confirmed that oligomycin and, to a lesser degree, valinomycin increase mitochondrial pH and that CCCP treatment decreases mitochondrial pH. Pulse-labeling experiments carried out under similar growth conditions showed that CCCP reduced CL by almost 45%, oligomycin resulted in small increase in CL (≈20%), and valinomycin treatment showed no effect, although the mean 32Pi incorporation in CL increased (Fig. 4a). These results are consistent with the change in mitochondrial matrix pH (Fig. 3b), such that an increase in mitochondrial matrix pH resulted in an increased incorporation of 32Pi in CL, whereas a decrease in pH resulted in the decreased biosynthesis of CL. To determine whether the effect of these inhibitors was on the first step of the CL biosynthetic pathway, we quantified PG in crd1Δ cells after treatment with inhibitors. PG biosynthesis was tested in crd1Δ cells, because PG levels in wild-type cells are very low and cannot be measured accurately. The high resolution separation of yeast phospholipids by one dimensional thin layer chromatography (Fig. 5) allowed reliable quantification of PG and CL in contrast to the NAO-based fluorescence assay in which case wild-type and crd1Δ cells showed similar fluorescence emission at 640 nm. None of the inhibitors affected synthesis of PG in crd1Δ cells (Fig. 4b), suggesting that CL synthesis was reduced by the inhibition of CL synthase. To determine whether CCCP inhibited CL synthase by affecting CRD1 expression, we measured the effect of inhibitors on the CRD1 mRNA level by Northern analysis. As seen in Fig. 6, none of the inhibitors affected CRD1 mRNA levels. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a decrease in mitochondrial pH leads to decreased CL synthesis by decreasing CL synthase enzyme activity.Fig. 5One-dimensional separation of yeast phospholipids.

We used pulse labeling to directly measure in vivo CL biosynthesis. Consistent with the hypothesis, inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by genetic mutation led to decreased CL synthesis. More specifically, the disruption of the pH gradient, but not membrane potential or ATP synthesis, resulted in decreased CL synthesis. These results support the hypothesis that the pathway for CL biosynthesis is regulated by the transmembrane pH component of the proton-motive force generated by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This is the first report that suggests the alteration of subcellular compartment pH as a mechanism of regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis. The enzymes of the CL biosynthetic pathway, PGP synthase, and CL synthase and the genes (PGS1 and CRD1) encoding these enzymes are regulated by factors affecting mitochondrial development such as growth phase, carbon source, and mitochondrial genome (29Zhao M.

These mitochondrial development factors regulated CL levels (Fig. 1) with the maximum pulse-labeled CL observed in the mid-logarithmic phase and maximum steady-state labeled CL in early stationary phase in YP galactose medium (Fig. 1). Our results corroborated earlier studies showing a doubling of CL levels in YP dextrose medium from logarithmic to stationary phase (38Jakovcic S. Getz G.S. Rabinowitz M. Jakob H. Swift H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A. Greenberg M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gradual increase in steady-state CL from early logarithmic to stationary phase is consistent with the expression profiles of CL pathway genes (50Jiang F. Gu Z. Granger J.M. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 52Zhong Q. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33978-33984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial development pattern in YP dextrose medium (53Yotsuyanagi Y. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1962; 7: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The growth phase regulation of pulse-labeled CL in YP dextrose (Fig. 1a) followed a pattern similar to the regulation of respiration in this medium (53Yotsuyanagi Y. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1962; 7: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that in vivo CL biosynthesis is linked to respiration. This link was further confirmed by the results showing a decrease in CL synthesis in almost all of the mitochondrial respiratory chain assembly mutants (Table II). This is consistent with the previous finding that CL synthase activity is reduced in respiratory chain assembly mutants (29Zhao M. Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2402-2408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism underlying the decrease in CL biosynthesis during respiratory deficiency, we used inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation that specifically perturb the trans-membrane pH gradient (CCCP), trans-membrane electrical gradient (valinomycin), and mitochondrial ATP generation (oligomycin). Matsuyama et al. (48Matsuyama S. Llopis J. Deveraux Q.L. Tsien R.Y. Reed J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) have shown that CCCP reduces the matrix pH by 0.5 units and that oligomycin increases matrix pH by 0.15 units in mammalian cells. We observed similar effects of these inhibitors in yeast cells with oligomycin treatment resulting in a small increase and CCCP resulting in a relatively large decrease in mitochondrial matrix pH (Fig. 3b). Consistent with the pH change, CCCP inhibited CL synthesis and oligomycin treatment resulted in a small increase in CL synthesis (Fig. 4a). PG biosynthesis (Fig. 4b) and CRD1 gene expression (Fig. 6) were unperturbed upon treatment with inhibitors, indicating that the pH effect is not at the level of PGP synthase or CRD1 gene expression. These findings indicate that CL biosynthesis is specifically regulated by the mitochondrial matrix pH at the level of CL synthase, which has a pH optimum of 9.0 (30Tamai K.T. Greenberg M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1046: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and an active site facing the mitochondrial matrix (40Gallet P.F. Petit J.M. Maftah A. Zachowski A. Julien R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mammalian (31Schlame M. Hostetler K.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22398-22403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and plant CL synthases (54Frentzen M. Griebau R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) display a strong pH dependence of reaction velocity around the mitochondrial matrix pH with the catalytic site facing the mitochondrial matrix (55Schlame M. Haldar D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 74-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, pH regulation of CL biosynthesis may be a universal mode of regulating CL levels in the eukaryotic kingdom. In summary, we have shown that in vivo CL biosynthesis is regulated by the pH component of the functional respiratory chain and that the effect is most probable at the level of CL synthase enzyme activity. This is the first demonstration of regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis by alteration of the mitochondrial matrix pH. We thank Gunther Daum for yeast strains and John M.

Mechanisms controlling enterocyte survival are poorly understood. We investigated the role of E-cadherin, a key protein of cell-cell adhesion, in the control of anoikis of normal intestinal epithelial cells, by detaching murine villus epithelial cells from the underlying basement membrane while preserving cell-cell interactions. We show that upon the loss of anchorage, normal enterocytes execute a program of apoptosis within minutes, via a Bcl-2-regulated and caspase-9-dependent pathway. E-cadherin is lost early from cell-cell contacts. This process precedes the execution phase of detachment-induced apoptosis as it is only weakly modulated by Bcl-2 overexpression or caspase inhibition. E-cadherin loss, however, is efficiently prevented by lysosome and proteasome inhibitors. We also found that a blocking anti-E-cadherin antibody increases the rate of anoikis, whereas the activation of E-cadherin using E-cadherin-Fc chimera proteins reduces anoikis. In conclusion, our results stress the striking sensitivity of normal enterocytes to the loss of anchorage and the contribution of E-cadherin to the control of their survival/apoptosis balance. They open new perspectives on the key role of this protein, which is dysregulated in the intestinal epithelium in both inflammatory bowel disease and cancer.

They open new perspectives on the key role of this protein, which is dysregulated in the intestinal epithelium in both inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. The intestinal epithelium displays one of the most rapid turnover rates of any mammalian tissue. Enterocytes differentiate from proliferative cells, during their migration along the crypt-to-villus axis (1Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After 2–6 days, these cells reach the villus tip and are shed into the intestinal lumen, with identical morphological features in human and mouse (2Mayhew T.M. Myklebust R. Whybrow A. Jenkins R. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis is thought to play a dual role in the maintenance of homeostasis in this epithelium: 1) at the base of the crypt (3Potten C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G253-G257PubMed Google Scholar) to control the number of stem cells and 2) in the shedding process of enterocytes at the villus tip by anoikis (1Gordon J.I. Hermiston M.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 2Mayhew T.M. Myklebust R. Whybrow A. Jenkins R. Histol.

Anoikis refers to apoptosis induced by a loss of cell-matrix interactions and was initially described for epithelial and endothelial cells (5Meredith Jr., J.E. Fazeli B. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 6Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Integrins, which act as adhesion receptors, control cell survival in response to extracellular matrix binding and also affect the cellular response to other survival and death signals, thereby controlling the fate of cells as a function of their immediate environment (7Frisch S.M. Screaton R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar, 8Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3729-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that cell-cell interactions also control cell survival, particularly via the classical cadherins, a family of transmembrane proteins promoting calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Cadherin homophilic ligation initiates the assembly of large adhesion multimolecular complexes, which are connected to the actin cytoskeleton via proteins of the catenin family (9Steinberg M.S. McNutt P.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This connection is essential for the stabilization and the strength of cell-cell junctions (10Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Cadherin engagement also leads to the transduction of intracellular signals (11Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 12Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and has been shown to protect squamous carcinoma cells and normal proximal tubular cells from anoikis (13Kantak S.S. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16953-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 14Bergin E. Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Lieberthal W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F758-F768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms controlling normal enterocyte survival are poorly understood. Electron microscopy studies suggest that cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions are disrupted sequentially in enterocytes reaching the villus tip (15Shibahara T. Sato N. Waguri S. Iwanaga T. Nakahara A. Fukutomi H. Uchiyama Y. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1995; 58: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, loss of E-cadherin function in intestinal epithelium via the targeted expression of a dominant negative N-cadherin mutant increases the frequency of apoptotic cells while perturbing migration and differentiation (16Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the remodeling of E-cadherin-cytoskeleton complexes upon the loss of anchorage might be involved in the apoptosis signaling cascade. Indeed, we recently showed that the targeting of E-cadherin to the upper lateral membrane and its co-localization with subcortical actin in Caco-2 enterocytic cells are controlled by cell-matrix interactions involving integrins (17Schreider C. Peignon G. Thenet S. Chambaz J. Pincon-Raymond M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 543-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested our hypothesis with an original model of anoikis in normal villus epithelium, in which interactions between epithelial cells and the underlying basement membrane were disrupted while cell-cell interactions were maintained. We found that, upon the loss of anchorage, normal enterocytes executed a strikingly rapid apoptosis program. We provide evidence that the loss of E-cadherin from cell-cell contacts, which occurred via a lysosome/proteasome-dependent degradation pathway, preceded the execution phase of detachment-induced apoptosis. Moreover, modulation of E-cadherin engagement affected the rate of apoptosis, demonstrating that E-cadherin participates in the control of anoikis in villus enterocytes. Cell Isolation and Culture—Intestinal villus epithelium was isolated as entire epithelial linings by a method modified from Perreault and Beaulieu (18Perreault N. Beaulieu J.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Adult B6CBA mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The small intestine (jejunum and ileum) was everted; washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. containing Ca2+, Mg2+, and 1 g/liter d-glucose (Invitrogen); and cut into 5-mm pieces. The fragments were incubated in Matrisperse™ (Becton Dickinson) at 4 °C for 2 h. Detachment of the epithelium from the mesenchyme was then induced by vigorous shaking and filtration through large-pored nylon mesh. After washing in ice-cold PBS, the detached epithelia were retained on a 70-μm nylon strainer, resuspended in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 0.2 IU/ml insulin (Novo Nordisk), and 5% fetal bovine serum (AbCys), plated on 24-well culture plates (8 wells/intestine) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The purity of the epithelial fraction was confirmed by the staining of 100% of the cells with an anti-keratin antibody (not shown) and by the absence of α-smooth muscle actin detected in Western blot (see Fig. 4A). The villus origin of this fraction was assessed by sucrase isomaltase activity; sucrase isomaltase-negative crypt fractions were only obtained after further incubations in chelating solutions (not shown). Epithelial linings were isolated in the same way from l-PK-bcl-2 transgenic mice expressing the human bcl-2 gene under control of the l-pyruvate kinase promoter (19Lacronique V. Mignon A. Fabre M. Viollet B. Rouquet N. Molina T. Porteu A. Henrion A. Bouscary D. Varlet P. Joulin V. Kahn A. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and nontransgenic littermates were used as a control. When indicated, the following proteases inhibitors were added to Matrisperse™ and culture medium: the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm; Bachem), the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (20 or 50 μm; Calbiochem), or the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine (100 μm; Sigma-Aldrich). Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: anti-E-cadherin (ECCD-2; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-β-catenin (clone 14; Transduction Laboratories), anti-mouse β1-integrin (clone MB1.2; Chemicon), anti-mouse β4-integrin (clone 346-11A; Pharmingen), anti-human Bcl2 (clone 124; DAKO), anti-actin (clone C4; Chemicon), anti-α-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4; Sigma), anti-caspase-8 (AAP-118; StressGen), anti-caspase-6 (AAP-106; StressGen), anti-human caspase-3 (H-277; Santa Cruz), anti-human caspase-9 (clone 5B4; Immunotech), and an anti-active caspase-3 antibody (Pharmingen). We used the following secondary antibodies: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat and anti-rabbit IgG (Production d'Anticorps, Réactifs Immunologiques et Services), Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse, Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit, and Cy2-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Electron Microscopy—Immediately after Matrisperse™ treatment, the epithelial linings were fixed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 0.6% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% tannic acid in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. The cells were postfixed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C in 2% osmic acid in phosphate buffer, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon resin (Poly/Bed 812; Polysciences). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were counterstained with uranylacetate and lead citrate and examined with a Jeol 100CX II microscope. Determination of Apoptosis—Internucleosomal cleavage was visualized by the extraction of small detergent-soluble fragments of DNA in 0.5% Triton X-100 (20Walker P.R. Leblanc J. Smith B. Pandey S. Sikorska M. Methods. 1999; 17: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel, using a 100-bp ladder (Invitrogen) as the standard. Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry analysis of subdiploid DNA content. The cells were dissociated by vigorous pipetting in ice-cold 2 mm EDTA in PBS and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Each pellet was resuspended sequentially in 100 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 μl of ribonuclease A (1 mg/ml), and 500 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. Analysis was performed on an ALTRA cell sorter (Beckmann Coulter) equipped with a UV/argon laser and Expo32 software. Cell doublets and clumps were gated out of the analysis, and a total of 10,000 single cells were analyzed for each sample. For some experiments, apoptosis was quantified by counting apoptotic nuclei on cryosections after staining with DAPI (100 ng/ml; Research Organics Inc). A minimum of 500 nuclei/section was counted for each determination. Immunofluorescence—Freshly removed small intestines or epithelial linings maintained in suspension for the indicated times were washed in ice-cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embedded in Tissue Tek OCT (Shandon), and 10-μm cryosections were cut. The sections were sequentially incubated in blocking buffer (1% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.2% w/v low fat milk powder, 0.3% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS) and then with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (anti-E-cadherin 1/250, anti-β1-integrin 1/1000, anti-β4-integrin 1/50, anti-Bcl-2 1/10, and anti-active caspase-3 1/50). Polymerized actin was stained with 0.5 μg/ml TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma), and the nuclei were stained with 100 ng/ml DAPI in PBS or with 2 μm TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes) in PBS-bovine serum albumin (1% w/v) after a 1 mg/ml RNase A treatment. The images were acquired on a DMR Leica epifluorescence microscope or on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope, with contrast and brightness settings kept constant throughout image acquisition. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein extracts were prepared from epithelial linings washed in PBS and solubilized in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA). The protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein-assay (Bio-Rad). 80-μg protein aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Applied Science). The following antibody dilutions were used: anti-caspase 3 (1/200), anti-caspase 6 (1/1000), anti-caspase 9 (1/1000), and anti-caspase 8 (1/1000). For the separation of Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions, the cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in CSK buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (20 μl/ml; Sigma). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was defined as the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. The pellet was extracted with the same volume of SDS buffer boiled for 10 min; insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was defined as the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. For each sample, a 100-μg protein aliquot of soluble fraction and an equal volume of insoluble fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred. The blots were incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v), 1% low fat milk powder (w/v), anti-E-cadherin (1/2500), anti-β-catenin (1/2000), anti-actin (1/2000), and anti-α-smooth muscle actin (1/1000)) and analyzed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Red Ponceau staining was used to ensure equal loading of proteins. The quantitative analyses were performed with a high performance calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad GS-800) using PD Quest and Image Quant 5.2 softwares. E-cadherin Perturbation Experiments—Detached epithelial linings were resuspended in culture medium containing either a function-blocking anti-E-cadherin antibody (DECMA-1 (11Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Vestweber D. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3393-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), 200 μg/ml (Sigma); or rat IgG as a control, 200 μg/ml (Chemicon)), or a functional E-cadherin ligand (12Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) (dimeric E-cadherin-Fc chimera protein, i.e. mouse E-cadherin ectodomain fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG1, 10 μg/ml; R & D Systems). In the latter case, E-cad-Fc was preincubated with epithelial linings for 15 min at 4 °C. Anti-human IgG specific for the Fc fragment (6 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added to trigger E-cad-Fc clustering at the cell membrane, as described for the clustering of activating antibodies (22Betson M. Lozano E. Zhang J. Braga V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36962-36969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the cells were immediately transferred to 37 °C. Controls were treated with anti-Fc IgG only. In both experiments, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde after 30 min, and apoptosis was assessed by counting apoptotic nuclei. Characterization of Apoptosis Triggered by Loss of Cell-Matrix Anchorage in Villus Epithelial Linings—We studied the response of normal enterocytes to the loss of anchorage without disruption of cell-cell interactions by detaching mouse intestinal villus cells from mesenchyme as entire epithelial linings, using a nonenzymatic dissociating solution (Matrisperse™). The resulting sheets of epithelial cells with conserved cell-cell contacts are shown in Fig. 1A. Ultrastructure analysis showed that the epithelial linings were still polarized, as shown by the basal position of the nuclei and the presence of a well organized brush border, and maintained cell-cell interactions (Fig. 1B). No basement membrane was present beneath the basal membrane (Fig. 1B, inset). We compared the distribution of the β1- and β4-integrins, the main integrin β chains present in the intestine (23Beaulieu J.F. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 31: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the intact tissue and in the freshly detached epithelial linings. Detachment had no marked effect on β1-integrin distribution along the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells. In contrast, β4-integrin was strictly restricted to the basal membrane of enterocytes within the tissue, as previously observed in human intestine (23Beaulieu J.F. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 31: 1-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately after detachment, β4-integrin labeling was still restricted to the basal pole of the epithelial cells but was more diffusely distributed. Although expressing integrins at their cell surface, albeit with changes in the β4 chain distribution, epithelial linings were unable to adhere when plated on collagen, laminin, or a native matrix deposited by mesenchymal cells (not shown). We then studied the fate of epithelial linings maintained in suspension at 37 °C. Immediately after detachment, all of the nuclei were normal in morphology, but as early as 30 min later, 20–30% of the nuclei were condensed or fragmented, indicating that apoptosis was underway (Fig. 2A). We checked that apoptosis was triggered by detachment from the mesenchyme, and not simply by ex vivo incubation, by incubating fragments of whole intestinal mucosa (explants) at 37 °C; no apoptotic nuclei were detected in epithelial cells still attached to the villus mesenchyme within explants (Fig. 2A). Study of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B) and flow cytometry quantification of subdiploid cells as a function of time (Fig. 2C) indicated that apoptosis was negligible immediately after detachment (0 min), becoming detectable within 15 min and rapidly increasing thereafter; 35% of sub-G1 events were detected after 30 min and 75% after 3 h. These data demonstrate the apoptotic nature of the cell death program triggered by loss of anchorage and its striking rapidity in normal enterocytes. Expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2, which protects against anoikis in epithelial cell lines (6Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar), is weak in the small intestine. To ask whether sensitivity to anoikis could be alleviated by bcl-2 overexpression in enterocytes, we used transgenic mice expressing the human bcl-2 gene under control of the l-pyruvate kinase promoter (19Lacronique V. Mignon A. Fabre M. Viollet B. Rouquet N. Molina T. Porteu A. Henrion A. Bouscary D. Varlet P. Joulin V. Kahn A. Nature Med. 1996; 2: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 levels were higher in villus-associated enterocytes from l-PK-bcl-2 transgenic mice than in those from wild-type littermates, as shown by immunostaining (Fig. 2D) and Western blotting (not shown). Bcl-2 overproduction clearly delayed detachment-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2E). The rate of apoptosis was also markedly reduced in the presence of 50 μm Z-VAD (Fig. 2E), indicating the involvement of caspase activation in the execution of anoikis. We used Western blots to assess activation of the initiator caspases-8 and -9 and of the executioner caspases-3 and -6 (Fig. 2F). Caspase-9 was activated within 30 min, as shown by a 40% decrease in the amount of the 45-kDa proform, concomitant with an obvious appearance of the 35-kDa activated form. In contrast, the amount of caspase-8 proforms did not markedly vary, and we did not observe any processing of this caspase. The activation of executioner caspase-6 and caspase-3 was detected within 30 min by a 60% decrease in the amount of the proforms of these enzymes and the obvious appearance of the 11-kDa activated form of caspase-3. The activation of caspases-9, -3, and -6 was reduced by Z-VAD and bcl-2 overexpression, with bcl-2-overexpressing enterocytes treated with Z-VAD presenting the most effective blockage. Quantitation of the cleaved forms indicated that caspase-3 activation was decreased by 90% upon Z-VAD treatment and was almost completely blocked by bcl-2 overexpression. Z-VAD treatment and bcl-2 overexpression decreased caspase-9 activation by 40 and 80%, respectively. The activation of caspase-3 was also evidenced by immunofluorescence, using an antibody that binds to a conformational epitope exposed by activation-induced cleavage of the inactive pro-caspase-3. Consistently with Western blot analysis, this antibody did not label epithelial cells in intact intestine or immediately after detachment (not shown). By contrast, intense cytoplasmic staining was detected after 30 min in all cells showing a condensed, apoptotic nucleus (Fig. 2G). The proportion of active caspase-3-labeled cells increased with time together with the proportion of condensed or fragmented nuclei (not shown). Overall, villus enterocytes are equipped to activate programmed cell death within minutes after loss of anchorage, and apoptosis is executed in most cells within 3 h via a Bcl-2-regulated and caspase-9-dependent pathway. Early Loss of E-cadherin from Cell-Cell Junctions Occurs during Anoikis and Is Insensitive to Apoptosis Inhibitors—In the course of our studies, we also observed progressive dissociation of the epithelial linings (not shown). We therefore analyzed E-cadherin by immunofluorescence staining during anoikis. E-cadherin staining was intense and restricted to cell-cell contacts immediately after detachment (0 min) and decreased and became diffuse in ∼50% of cells after 30 min (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the combined analysis of E-cadherin localization and of nuclear morphology showed that after 30 min, E-cadherin was either lost or preserved at cell-cell contacts in cell clusters that still presented intact nuclei, whereas E-cadherin labeling was very faint and diffuse in all cells showing apoptotic nuclear morphology (Fig. 3B, upper left panel). After 90 min, E-cadherin staining was almost undetectable in ∼90% of cells, whereas only 60% of cells were apoptotic (Fig. 3B, lower left panel). Among the thousands cells observed, no cell displayed both an apoptotic nucleus and membranes stained for E-cadherin. These results suggest that E-cadherin is lost from cell-cell contacts before the execution of apoptosis in our system. We investigated the effect of apoptosis inhibition on the fate of E-cadherin. Bcl-2 overproduction or Z-VAD treatment decreased the proportion of apoptotic nuclei at both 30 and 90 min (Fig. 3B, three right panels, consistent with Fig. 2). However, these treatments had no major effect on the loss of E-cadherin throughout anoikis. A delay in the disappearance of E-cadherin was nevertheless observed in enterocytes overexpressing bcl-2 and treated by Z-VAD, suggesting that the loss of E-cadherin is, at most, secondarily amplified upon apoptosis. These data support the hypothesis that E-cadherin loss at the cell membrane precedes both caspase activation and appearance of the morphological hallmarks of apoptosis. Apoptosis Inhibitors Efficiently Inhibit β-Catenin Cleavage but Have Little Effect on the Decrease in E-cadherin Levels—To clarify the fate of E-cadherin in epithelial linings upon loss of anchorage, immunofluorescence studies were supplemented by Western blot analyses of Triton-soluble and insoluble fractions at various time points. Just after detachment of epithelial linings, E-cadherin was primarily located in the detergent-insoluble fraction, which comprises polymerized actin (10Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), as in native whole intestine mucosa (Fig. 4A). This result and our morphological observations indicate that most of the E-cadherin was retained in the junctional complexes after Matrisperse™-induced detachment. The majority of β-catenin was also detected in the detergent-insoluble fraction, and its pattern of migration was identical in native intestine and in detached epithelium. Upon incubation in suspension, we observed a dramatic time-dependent decrease in the amount of E-cadherin associated with both the insoluble and soluble fractions (Fig. 4B). When related to total actin, only 1% of the initial amount of total E-cadherin was detected after 90 min. Consistent with immunofluorescence studies (Fig. 3B), the kinetics of this decrease in E-cadherin levels was not markedly affected by Z-VAD treatment or by Bcl-2 overproduction; only 4 and 13% of the initial amounts, respectively, were still detected after 90 min (Fig. 4B). The protective effects by apoptosis modulators visualized at 30 min were no more observed at 90 min, except when the two modulators were combined. It has been shown that during apoptosis, E-cadherin is cleaved on its intracytoplasmic domain in a caspase-dependent manner and on its extracellular domain by a metalloproteinase (24Schmeiser K. Grand R.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Steinhusen U. Weiske J. Badock V. Tauber R. Bommert K. Huber O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4972-4980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the present model of enterocyte anoikis, no accumulation of cleaved fragments was detected, when using antibodies directed against the ectodomain or the cytodomain of E-cadherin (not shown). Because β-catenin, one of the cytoplasmic partner of E-cadherin, has also been shown to be cleaved by caspases in several models of apoptosis (26Steinhusen U. Badock V. Bauer A. Behrens J. Wittman-Liebold B. Dorken B. Bommert K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16345-16353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we analyzed β-catenin degradation upon enterocyte anoikis. In contrast to E-cadherin, β-catenin was clearly progressively cleaved into several fragments that were detected mainly in the Triton-soluble fraction (Fig. 4B). This cleavage process was inhibited by 75% upon Z-VAD treatment and by 90% upon Bcl-2 overproduction (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, despite protecting against β-catenin cleavage, Z-VAD treatment or Bcl-2 overproduction were able to delay, but not to fully prevent, the redistribution of β-catenin from the insoluble to the soluble fraction. These observations are consistent with a remodeling of the multimolecular E-cadherin-β-catenin-actin complexes that still occurs when apoptosis is inhibited and when β-catenin is not cleaved. E-cadherin Degradation during Anoikis Occurs via a Proteasome- and Lysosome-dependent Pathways—Our results indicate that E-cadherin loss precedes apoptosis induction and does not involve degradation by caspases. The proteasome and the lysosome have been involved in the degradation of E-cadherin and of other classical cadherin when junctional complexes are destabilized (27Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B.

We show that TNF treatment produced a modest inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated transcriptional activation of a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter-driven luciferase construct in HeLa cells. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), are important mediators of target gene activation by TNF, and JNK activation was earlier shown to inhibit GR-mediated transcriptional activation by direct phosphorylation of GR at Ser-246. Transfection of HeLa cells with MKK6b(E), a constitutively active specific upstream activator of p38, led to a potent inhibition of GR activation of the MMTV promoter-driven luciferase construct. A similar inhibition of activation of the MMTV promoter-driven luciferase construct was seen in HeLa cells transfected with MKK7(D), a constitutively functional activator of JNK. Data from “domain swap” experiments using GR chimeras indicated that the main target of the p38-mediated (but not JNK-mediated) inhibition is the ligand-binding domain of GR (spanning amino acids 525–795), whereas the constitutively active N-terminal AF-1 region (spanning amino acids 106–237) is dispensable for the inhibitory effect of p38. We also demonstrate that activated p38 targets the GR ligand-binding domain indirectly. Suppression of GR function by activated p38 and JNK MAP kinases may be physiologically important as a mechanism of resistance to glucocorticoids seen in many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions.

TNF and its signaling intermediates promote many immune and inflammatory processes (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2114) Google Scholar), whereas glucocorticoids are generally immunosuppressive and they inhibit pro-inflammatory events, including bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF production (4Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor with a modular structure, the principal functions of which (transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and ligand binding) are localized to specific domains (6Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The unliganded GR exists in the cytoplasm as a large heteromeric complex that comprises hsp90 and other stabilizing proteins (7Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). Binding of glucocorticoids causes dissociation of the hsp90-GR complex, enabling the receptor with the bound hormone to translocate to the nucleus and bind as a homodimer to the glucocorticoid-response element in regulatory regions of target genes (6Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).TNF plays a role in immune responses important in host defenses against infectious agents (1Wajant H.

One possible outcome of TNF signaling is apoptosis, resulting from the activation of the caspase cascade. More commonly, TNF signaling activates the expression of genes with pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. TNF-induced gene expression is largely mediated by activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar, 2Pfeffer K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 3Aggarwal B.B.

Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar). A mutually antagonistic relationship exists between NF-κB and GR in that NF-κB can suppress the function of GR and GR effectively inhibits NF-κB activation (10Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 11McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr.

Activation of AP-1 family transcription factors by TNF is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase (1Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

Inhibition of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and interleukin-1, and of other inflammatory mediators is thought to be the main mechanism whereby glucocorticoids exert their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activities (4Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Han J. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). These actions are at least partly mediated by interference with transcription factors, especially NF-κB and AP-1 (12Dumont A. Hehner S.P. Schmitz M.L. Gustafsson J.A. Liden J. Okret S. van der Saag P.T. Wissink S. van der Burg B. Herrlich P. Haegeman G. De Bosscher K. Fiers W. Trends Biochem.

NF-κB inhibition is in part due to the induction by glucocorticoids of IκB, the inhibitory subunit of NF-κB (10Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory actions of glucocorticoids have also been attributed to direct interactions between GR and NF-κB or AP-1 (12Dumont A. Hehner S.P. Schmitz M.L. Gustafsson J.A. Liden J. Okret S. van der Saag P.T. Wissink S. van der Burg B. Herrlich P. Haegeman G. De Bosscher K. Fiers W. Trends Biochem.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2465-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and to the activation of some genes with anti-inflammatory action (15Elenkov I.J. Chrousos G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 966: 290-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar).JNK and p38 MAP kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine kinases activated in response to cellular stress (hyperosmotic shock, UV radiation, oxidative, or chemical stress) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF or interleukin-1 (16Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 17Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Three principal MAP kinase families, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), JNK, and p38, are defined by their structural properties and unique phosphorylation sites (18Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Each of the MAP kinase subfamilies is activated by specific upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK) that phosphorylate MAP kinases on a threonine and tyrosine residue separated by another intervening amino acid. Direct activators of JNK are MKK4 and MKK7 (19Wu Z. Wu J. Jacinto E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7407-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 20Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), whereas activators of p38 are MKK3 and MKK6 (21Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Earlier we demonstrated that JNK and ERK inhibited GR-mediated transcriptional activation, which could be attributed to GR phosphorylation at Ser-246 by JNK but not ERK (22Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). P38 kinase failed to phosphorylate a GR fragment comprising Ser-246 in vitro, but the effect of p38 on GR-mediated transcriptional activation has not been examined (22Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar).In the present study, we examined the effect of TNF on glucocorticoid signaling. TNF action results in a rapid activation of p38 and JNK, and these MAP kinases are responsible for the activation of downstream target genes by TNF (8Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 23New L. Han J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that p38 activation by its specific upstream activator, MKK6, leads to a potent inhibition of GR. Our data indicate that the p38-mediated inhibition targets actions mediated by the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GR. In agreement with earlier data (22Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we show that activation of JNK by its upstream activator, MKK7, greatly diminished GR transcriptional activity. In the intact organism, suppression of GR function by activated p38 and JNK MAP kinases may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for unresponsiveness to glucocorticoids that develops in many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions (25Irusen E.

Hormone treatments were done in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum containing 100 nm dexamethasone.Reagents—Dexamethasone was from Sigma, and recombinant human TNF was provided by Masafumi Tsujimoto of the Suntory Institute for Biomedical Research (Osaka, Japan). SB203580 was from Tocris Cookson Inc. To detect endogenous GR, we used polyclonal anti-GR prepared in one of our laboratories (27Wang Z. Frederick J. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26573-26580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 (C-20) and anti-JNK1,3 (C-17) sera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 (recognizing p38 dually phosphorylated on Thr-180 and Tyr-182) and monoclonal anti-phospho-JNK antibodies (recognizing JNKs dually phosphorylated on Thr-183 and Tyr-185) were from New England Biolabs. The anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5) was from Roche Applied Science.Plasmids—Full-length human MKK6b(E) and MKK7(D) sequences cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector were gifts from Dr. Jiahuai Han, Scripps Research Institute. The MKK6b(E) and MKK7(D) constructs encode constitutively active kinases containing mutations of the critical Ser and Thr residues in their activation loops to Glu or Asp, respectively. The pHAGAL4-GR525–795 construct, encoding the ligand-binding domain of GR fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and HA tag, was prepared by subcloning the XhoI/XbaI fragment of pGAL4-GR525–795 into pcDNA3HAGAL4. pHAGAL4-GR106–237 contains the GR N-terminal AF-1 domain linked to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) and HA tag. The mutant pHAGAL4-GRLBDT547A was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to manufacturer's instructions. All generated plasmids were verified by sequencing. MMTV-Luc reporter construct, containing composite glucocorticoid-response element from mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat upstream of the luciferase gene, was used to assess GR transactivation activity. The p4xκB luciferase construct, containing multimerized NF-κB-binding elements from the immunoglobulin κ enhancer, was provided by Dr. David Ron, New York University School of Medicine. pCMV-lacZ was used to generate β-galactosidase. The pcDNA3 vector (gift from Dr. David Wallach, Weizmann Institute) was used to equalize the total amount of transfected DNA.Transient Transfection and GR Activity Assay—One day before transfection, the cells were plated on 35-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum. The following day, the subconfluent cells were transfected for 4 h with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with the indicated agents or left untreated (i.e. treated with the corresponding vehicle). Following the treatments, transfected HeLa cells were lysed in 150 μlof1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Fifty-μl aliquots of lysates were assayed for luciferase activity following addition to a 300-μl reaction volume containing 25 mm glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Luciferase activity was measured with Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) using 1 mm d-luciferin (Pharmingen) as substrate and normalized to total protein concentration determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay or β-galactosidase activity. In extracts of cells transfected with activators of p38 or JNK, luciferase activity was normalized to total protein concentration, not to β-galactosidase activity, because activated p38 and JNK influenced viral or human promoter-driven β-galactosidase.Western Blotting—To make protein extracts from transfected cells, HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm PPi, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF) or 250 μlof1× sample buffer for GR, containing 2% SDS, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8. The lysates were collected and centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were adjusted in all samples with the lysis buffer (or sample buffer), and the whole cell extracts were boiled with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. For Western blotting, protein extracts were fractionated on 8–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (depending on the Mr of the protein), transferred to Immobilon paper (Millipore), and probed with an anti-GR, anti-phospho-p38 (after stripping: anti-p38), anti-phospho-JNK (after stripping: anti-JNK1,3), or anti-HA antibody, respectively. The blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (pp38, JNK1,3, or GR), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (pJNK, HAGAL4-GR525–795, HAGAL4-GRLBDT547A), or horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A (p38) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories).RESULTSPartial Suppression of GR-mediated Transcription by TNF—To determine whether TNF can antagonize GR-dependent transcriptional activation, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the MMTV-Luc reporter construct, which is responsive to glucocorticoid stimulation, and then treated for 16 h with dexamethasone in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of TNF, as indicated (Fig. 1A). GR-mediated transcriptional activity was increased ∼10-fold by treatment with dexamethasone, and TNF treatment decreased dexamethasone-stimulated luciferase activity by up to ∼30%. This inhibitory action of TNF was reproducible in independent experiments. In related experiments, HeLa cells were transfected with the same constructs as in the experiment shown in Fig. 1A, and luciferase activity was determined after only 4 h of treatment with dexamethasone and TNF; these experiments showed a similar partial inhibitory effect by TNF as in Fig. 1A (data not shown). The relatively low level of inhibition of GR-mediated transcriptional activation by TNF was somewhat surprising because two of the main intracellular mediators of TNF action, namely NF-κB (11McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and JNK (22Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), were earlier shown to inhibit GR activity. To ascertain that TNF was active in the HeLa cells used in this experiment, TNF-induced transcriptional activation was measured in cells transfected with the p4xκB-luciferase reporter construct (Fig. 1B). TNF produced an ∼10-fold increase in luciferase activity, confirming that the cells were TNF-responsive.Activation of Endogenous p38 by Transfection with MKK6b(E) Leads to a Potent Inhibition of GR-mediated Transcriptional Activation—In the next set of experiments, we examined the role of p38 MAP kinase, one of the mediators of TNF actions, in the inhibition of GR-dependent transcriptional activation. The cells were co-transfected with the MMTV-Luc reporter construct and increasing amounts of MKK6b(E), a specific constitutive activator of p38 (29Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J.

MKK6b(E) activated endogenous p38 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, middle panel) and significantly inhibited both dexamethasone-stimulated and constitutive GR transcriptional activity (Fig. 2A). The highest dose of MKK6b(E) used reduced dexamethasone-stimulated GR activity by over 90%. The level of p38 protein was not affected by MKK6b(E) co-expression or by treatment with dexamethasone (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). The observed inhibition of GR activity was not due to a reduction in GR expression as the level of receptor protein was not significantly affected by MKK6b(E) (Fig. 2B, top panel). However, dexamethasone treatment slightly reduced GR protein levels (Fig. 2B, top panel), likely due to receptor down-regulation by the ligand (31Burnstein K.L. Jewell C.M. Sar M. Cidlowski J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1764-1773PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, pretreatment with SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor (30Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar), reversed the inhibition of GR transactivation by MKK6b(E), confirming that the inhibitory effect was indeed attributable to MKK6b(E)-mediated p38 activation (data not shown). Altogether, these results demonstrate that sustained specific activation of p38 results in a strong inhibition of GR transcriptional activation.Fig. 2Activation of p38 by its specific constitutive activator MKK6b(E) inhibits GR-dependent transcription.A, HeLa cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of a pMMTV-Luc reporter construct and 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, or 1.35 μg of MKK6b(E). On the following day, cells were left untreated or treated for 16 h with 100 nm dexamethasone (Dex) prior to harvest. Empty pcDNA3 vector was used to equalize the amount of DNA in all transfection experiments. Luciferase activities were determined and normalized to total protein concentration. Luciferase activity induced by dexamethasone in the absence of MKK6b(E) co-transfection was set as 100%. B, whole cell lysates were prepared from a parallel set of transfected cells. To check the GR expression level, the lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody against GR (GR-α, top panel) as well as an antibody against phosphorylated p38 (middle panel, circled letter p indicates phosphorylation) and total p38 (bottom panel) to demonstrate activation of endogenous p38 by MKK6b(E) transfection and as a loading control, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activation of Endogenous JNK by Its Specific Activator MKK7(D) Inhibits GR-mediated Transcriptional Activation— Earlier work showed that JNK phosphorylates GR at Ser-246, leading to an inhibition of GR-mediated transcription (22Rogatsky I.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2382-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To confirm the effect of JNK activation on endogenous GR activity and to compare it with the effect of p38 activation, we transfected HeLa cells with MKK7(D), a specific constitutive activator of JNK (30Alpert D. Schwenger P. Han J. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22176-22183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Yang J. New L. Jiang Y. Han J. Su B. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), along with the MMTV-Luc reporter construct used in the preceding experiments. MKK7(D) decreased dexamethasone-stimulated and constitutive GR transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent manner, with the highest dose of MKK7(D) inhibiting dexamethasone-stimulated GR transactivation by 80% (Fig. 3A). For comparison, one group was co-transfected with MMTV-Luc and the p38 activator MKK6b(E) used in the previous experiment (Fig. 3A, right-hand bars), which resulted in a slightly higher inhibition of GR transactivation than co-transfection with MKK7(D). MKK7(D)-mediated activation of JNK is evident from a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of JNK p54 and especially JNK p46 (Fig. 3B, middle panel). MKK7(D) co-expression did not significantly affect the GR protein level (Fig. 3B, top panel) or the level of JNK proteins (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). As also seen in the previous experiment shown in Fig. 2B, we observed a slight dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of GR (Fig. 3B, top panel). Thus, in agreement with previous findings (22Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2050-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Itoh M. Adachi M. Yasui H. Takekawa M. Tanaka H. Imai K. Mol.

An additional group was transfected with 1.35 μg of MKK6b(E) as a control. Luciferase activities were determined and normalized to total protein concentration. Dex, dexamethasone. B, lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody against GR (GR-α, top panel), phospho-JNK (pJNK p54 and pJNK p46, middle panel, circled letter p indicates phosphorylation), and total JNK (JNK1 p46 and JNK3 p54β, bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Role of the Ligand-binding Domain/AF-2 of GR in p38-mediated Inhibition—It is well known that different functions can be localized to specific GR regions (34Schaaf M.J. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 83: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The DBD is localized in the center of the molecule (spanning amino acids 440–525 in the rat GR), whereas the C-terminally located region spanning amino acids 525–795 is the LBD. At least two regions possess intrinsic transcriptional activation functions. AF-1, located at the N terminus, is hormone-independent and constitutive. In contrast, AF-2, which maps to the C terminus, is hormone-dependent. To identify the regions of GR that might be involved in the observed inhibition, the AF domains of rat GR were linked to the heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain and were assessed separately for their ability to be repressed by p38 or JNK.The HAGAL4-GR525–795 construct, containing the ligand-dependent AF-2/LBD domain linked to the HA-tagged heterologous GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 4A), was co-transfected into HeLa cells with a GAL4-luciferase reporter construct. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a greater than 100-fold stimulation of reporter activity, which was potently inhibited by co-transfection with the p38 activator, MKK6b(E) (Fig. 4B). This inhibitory effect was completely reversed by treatment with the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (32Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C.

Given the high expression levels of MiRP1 and HCN subunits in the cardiac sinoatrial node and the contribution of pacemaker channel function to impulse initiation in that tissue, such an interaction could be of considerable physiological significance. However, the functional evidence for MiRP1/HCN interactions in heterologous expression studies has been accompanied by inconsistencies between studies in terms of the specific effects on channel function. To evaluate the effect of MiRP1 on HCN expression and function in a physiological context, we used an adenovirus approach to overexpress a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MiRP1 (HAMiRP1) and HCN2 in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, a cell type that expresses both MiRP1 and HCN2 message at low levels. HA-MiRP1 co-expression with HCN2 resulted in a 4-fold increase in maximal conductance of pacemaker currents compared with HCN2 expression alone. HCN2 activation and deactivation kinetics also changed, being significantly more rapid for voltages between –60 and –95 mV when HA-MiRP1 was co-expressed with HCN2. However, the voltage dependence of activation was not affected. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that expressed HA-MiRP1 and HCN2, as well as endogenous MiRP1 and HCN2, co-assemble in ventricular myocytes. The results indicate that MiRP1 acts as a β subunit for HCN2 pacemaker channel subunits and alters channel gating at physiologically relevant voltages in cardiac cells.

MinK-related protein (MiRP1 or KCNE2) is purported to be a β subunit for several voltage-gated potassium channels, including the rapid delayed rectifier (1Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E.

In addition, we have reported that it can act as a β subunit for the hyperpolarizationactivated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 1The abbreviations used are: HCN, hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Ad, adenovirus.1The abbreviations used are: HCN, hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; Ad, adenovirus. family of pacemaker channels (4Yu H. Wu J. Potapova I. Wymore R.T. Holmes B. Zuckerman J. Pan Z. Wang H. Shi W. Robinson R.B. El-Maghrabi R. Benjamin W. Dixon J. McKinnon D. Cohen I.S. Wymore R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: e84-e87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that co-expression of MiRP1 with HCN1 or HCN2 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in larger and more rapidly activating currents than when either HCN isoform was expressed alone but that MiRP1 did not shift the midpoint of activation of either isoform. Further, co-immunoprecipitation experiments involving HA-tagged MiRP1 and HCN1 demonstrated that the two proteins interact when co-expressed in oocytes.A more recent study demonstrated MiRP1 interaction with the HCN4 isoform. Here, co-expression with MiRP1, either in oocytes or Chinese hamster ovary cells, also resulted in increased current amplitude, but this was associated with slowing of kinetics and a negative shift of the midpoint of activation (5Decher N. Bundis F. Vajna R. Steinmeyer K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, another laboratory did not detect any effect of MiRP1 when co-expressed in HEK293 cells with either HCN4 or an HCN1-HCN4 tandem construct (6Altomare C. Terragni B. Brioschi C. Milanesi R. Pagliuca C. Viscomi C. Moroni A. Baruscotti M. DiFrancesco D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 347-359Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, a study of MiRP1 and HCN2 co-expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells reported a reduced time-dependent current component and increased instantaneous component, compared with HCN2 expression alone (7Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Thus, depending on the HCN isoform and cell background, MiRP1 has been reported to speed, slow, or not affect kinetics of activation; increase, decrease, or not affect current amplitude; and shift or not shift voltage dependence of HCN channels. Because message for both HCN subunits and MiRP1 proteins are expressed at high abundance in the cardiac sinoatrial node (4Yu H. Wu J. Potapova I. Wymore R.T. Holmes B. Zuckerman J. Pan Z. Wang H.

Ehrlich J. Han W. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), interaction of these subunits and subsequent change of channel function within a myocardial cell could have a major impact on cardiac rhythm. To address this question, we have co-expressed MiRP1 and HCN2 in cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. These cultures normally exhibit spontaneous activity, primarily express message for the HCN2 isoform (9Shi W. Wymore R. Yu H. Wu J. Wymore R.T. Pan Z. Robinson R.B. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Cohen I.S. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e1-e6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and possess a native pacemaker current that is small and therefore readily distinguished from the current resulting from overexpressed channels (10Qu J. Barbuti A. Protas L. Santoro B. Cohen I.S. Robinson R.B. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: e8-e14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Isolation and Culture—Neonatal rats were sacrificed, and the ventricles were removed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocols of Columbia University. A standard trypsin dissociation method was employed to prepare newborn ventricle cell cultures (11Protas L. Robinson R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H940-H946PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were preplated to reduce fibroblast proliferation, cultured initially in serum-containing medium, and switched to serum-free medium after 24 h. For voltage clamp experiments, 6-day-old monolayer cultures were resuspended by brief (2–3 min) exposure to 0.25% trypsin, and then the cells were replated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips and studied within 2–8 h. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, 6-day-old cultures were harvested as described below.Expression of HCN2, MiRP1, and MinK—For increased expression efficiency, we employed an adenoviral construct of mouse HCN2 (accession number AJ225122) prepared as previously described (10Qu J. Barbuti A. Protas L. Santoro B. Cohen I.S. Robinson R.B. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: e8-e14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA fragment of rat MiRP1 (accession number AF071003) with an HA tag at the C terminus was first cut out from its original vector pRc/CMV2 at EcoRI and SpeI and then subcloned into pDC516 at EcoRI and SmaI. The resulting pDC516-mHCN2 or pDC516-MiRP1-HA shuttle plasmid was co-transfected with a 35.5-kb E1-deleted Ad genomic plasmid pBHGfrtΔE1,3FLP (AdMax™) into E1-complementing HEK293 cells. The HA tag was added to MiRP1 to facilitate detection of MiRP1 protein and was previously shown not to affect the ability of MiRP1 to increase HCN currents (4Yu H. Wu J. Potapova I. Wymore R.T. Holmes B. Zuckerman J. Pan Z. Wang H. Shi W. Robinson R.B. El-Maghrabi R. Benjamin W. Dixon J. McKinnon D. Cohen I.S. Wymore R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: e84-e87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The adenoviral construct of HCN2 (AdHCN2) or MiRP1 with the HA tag (AdHA-MiRP1) was subsequently harvested and CsCl-purified. An adenoviral vector of GFP (AdGFP) was constructed the same way as AdHCN2 or AdHA-MiRP1 and used to maintain a constant total viral load under all experimental conditions. It has been demonstrated that GFP itself does not alter the characteristics of HCN2 channels in the myocytes (10Qu J. Barbuti A. Protas L. Santoro B. Cohen I.S. Robinson R.B. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: e8-e14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, for negative control experiments, human MinK (accession number NM000219) in pBlueScript R vector (Open Biosystems) was subcloned into pDC516-IRES-GFP at EcoRI and SalI and used to prepare an adenovirus that co-expressed MinK and GFP (AdMinK-GFP). The functionality of AdMinK-GFP was confirmed in separate experiments measuring its effect on the slow delayed rectifier current (data not shown).Infection of neonatal cells with the appropriate adenoviruses (e.g. AdHCN2+AdHA-MiRP1 or AdHCN2+AdGFP) was done on monolayer cultures 4 days after plating. The culture medium was removed from each dish, and a virus containing inoculum was added. For electrophysiology experiments cells were initially grown in 35-mm dishes, and the inoculum volume was 0.2–0.3 ml, whereas for co-immunoprecipitation experiments the cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, and the inoculum volume was 0.7 ml. The total multiplicity of infection (ratio of viral units to cells) was 30–40, and when multiple viruses were employed on the same culture dish this multiplicity of infection was equally divided among the viruses. The inoculum was dispersed over the cells by gently tilting the dishes every 20 min. The dishes were kept at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator during the 2-h adsorption period, and then the inoculum was discarded, and the dishes were washed and refilled with the appropriate culture medium. The dishes remained in the incubator for 2 days before electrophysiological or biochemical experiments were conducted.Membrane Extraction and Immunochemistry—To prepare membranes from myocyte cultures, the culture medium was first aspirated from the 100-mm dishes, and the infected myocytes were rinsed with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free saline, 8 ml/dish, which contained 133 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, and 16.5 mm dextrose. Then 0.5 ml/dish of ice-cold homogenization buffer, which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.042% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.05 mg/ml benzamidin, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.005 mm pepstatin A, was added. The myocytes were scraped from each dish, transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf ultracentrifuge tubes, and sonicated (20 pulses) at 4 °C. The preparations were then spun at 185,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the myocyte membrane fraction was extracted and collected in the form of pellets for immunochemistry experiments.The tissues for membrane preparations from rat neonatal ventricle or canine sinoatrial node (0.5 g) were homogenized in 10-fold volume (w/v) of ice-cold 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm histidine with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) with five 10-s bursts at full speed on a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g, and the supernatant was centrifuged for 90 min at 100,000 × g.For both culture and tissue preparation, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Insoluble material was sedimented for an additional 30 min at 10,000 × g. The protein concentration was determined with the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For immunoprecipitation, 350–500 μg of membrane protein was incubated with 2 μg of primary antibody for 4 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubation at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 and collected after each wash by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.Samples (25–50 μg of solubilized membrane protein or immunoprecipitates) for SDS-PAGE were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated on Criterion (Bio-Rad) 7.5% resolving gel (for HCN2 staining) or on a 8–16% linear gradient gel (for MiRP1 and HA-MiRP1 staining) in a Laemmli Tris-glycine buffer system (for HCN2) or in a Tris-Tricine buffer system (for MiRP1) with prestained molecular mass marker (New England BioLabs). The proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred to 0.2-μm pore nitrocellulose and Immun-Blot PVD membrane (Bio-Rad), respectively, for HCN2 and MiRP1. For immunoblotting, all of the membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation in 5% nonfat milk in TTBS, which contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with anti-HCN2 (Alomone Labs), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-MiRP1 (Alomone Labs), or anti-MinK (Alomone Labs) antibodies for 1 h. The blots were then washed three times for 15 min each with TTBS. After incubating with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG antibody (1:20,000 dilution) and washing three times for 15 min each with TTBS, the immunoblots were visualized on Kodak x-ray film using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Electrophysiological Recording and Data Analysis—Expressed HCN2 current (IHCN2) was recorded using a patch electrode in whole cell mode on cells superfused at 35 °C. Extracellular solution (pH 7.4) contained 140 mm NaCl, 2.3 mm NaOH, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 5 m m HEPES, and 10 mm glucose. Two mm MnCl2 and 4 m m BaCl2 were added to the superfusate to eliminate calcium and inward rectifier currents, respectively. Pipette solution contained 130 mm aspartic acid, 146 mm KOH, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 m m EGTA-KOH, 2 mm Mg-ATP, and 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.2). A fast solution changing apparatus expedited the experimental protocols. The pipette resistance was 1–3 MΩ. An Axopatch-200B amplifier and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments) were used for acquisition and analysis.The instantaneous component was defined as the difference between the holding current of –35 mV and the initial current level where the time-dependent current component begins. IHCN2 was defined as the time-dependent component (with instantaneous component subtracted) at the end of a 6-s hyperpolarizing step ranging from –35 to –125 mV with decrements of 10 mV from a holding potential of –35 mV. The hyperpolarizing step was followed by an 8-s step to –125 mV to record tail current and then a 0.5-s pulse to +5 mV to ensure full deactivation. Tail currents were measured at –125 mV to avoid contamination by currents present at less negative voltages. The current-voltage (I-V) relation was constructed from the current measured at the end of the 6-s hyperpolarizing steps. Then the I-V curve was fitted to the relation I = gmax * y * (V – Erev), in which y = 1/(1 + exp ((V – V½)/K)). The parameters gmax and Erev are the maximum conductance and reversal potential of HCN2 channels, respectively, whereas V½ and K represent the voltage where half of the channels are activated and the slope factor of the activation relation, respectively. Erev was determined by a protocol in which HCN2 currents were generated by a hyperpolarizing prepulse to –125 mV followed by deactivating steps ranging from –95 to 0 mV in increments of 5 mV. Erev is the voltage where the current reversed its direction. Tail currents, plotted against test voltages and fitted with the Boltzmann function (Itail = Itail,max/(1 + exp ((V - V½)/K))) were used to determine V½ and K. The kinetics of activation were determined by a single exponential fit to the early time course of the current activated by hyperpolarization; the initial delay and any late slow activation were ignored. Kinetics of deactivation were determined by a single exponential fit of the time course of the current trace at each test voltage after activation by a prepulse to –125 mV. For both activation and deactivation, the duration of the trace being fit was at least three times the measured time constant to ensure accuracy.All of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was examined by t test or analysis of variance followed by pairwise multiple comparisons (Holm-Sidak method) as appropriate and determined at p < 0.05.RESULTSCo-expression of HA-MiRP1 Increases the Magnitude of HCN2 Current—HCN2 channels delivered via an adenoviral vector (AdHCN2) are well expressed in the ventricular myocytes of neonatal rats (10Qu J. Barbuti A. Protas L. Santoro B. Cohen I.S. Robinson R.B. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: e8-e14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the magnitude of expressed HCN2 current was greater when co-infected with AdHA-MiRP1 (compared with control cultures co-infected with AdGFP), indicating that HA-MiRP1 co-expression up-regulates HCN2 channel expression or otherwise increases current magnitude in the myocytes.Because it has been reported that the instantaneous component of HCN2 current could be regulated in a heterologous system by co-expression of MiRP1 (7Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we examined whether this also is the case for the co-expression of HCN2 with MiRP1 in cardiac myocytes. We did not observe a significant difference in the instantaneous component of HCN2 current when coexpressed with HA-MiRP1 in ventricular myocytes. When the instantaneous component was measured at –105 mV (note arrows indicating instantaneous component in Fig. 1), the current density was 15.7 ± 4.5 pA/pF for HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 (n = 16) versus 13.1 ± 3.1 pA/pF for HCN2 alone (n = 14); p > 0.05.Fig. 2A plots the mean I-V relation of HCN2 channels coexpressed with and without HA-MiRP1. The difference in the magnitude of the time-dependent component of HCN2 current is statistically significant between HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 and HCN2 alone (analysis of variance, p < 0.001). In Fig. 2B the I-V relations have been converted to conductance (g) versus voltage (g-V) relations via the formula g = I/(V – Erev). Erev did not differ between groups and was –38.3 ± 2.8 mV (n = 6) for HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 and –35.0 ± 3.2 mV (n = 5) for HCN2 alone (p > 0.05). The HCN2 maximum conductance was significantly higher when HA-MiRP1 was co-expressed, being 0.727 ± 0.01 nS/pF (n = 16) for HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 and 0.174 ± 0.005 nS/pF (n = 13) for HCN2 alone (p < 0.001). The difference in current density was not secondary to a difference in capacitance, which did not differ between cells expressing HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 and those expressing only HCN2 (31.9 ± 2.5 pF (n = 18) and 29.6 ± 1.8 pF (n = 17) respectively; p > 0.05).Fig. 2Current and conductance relations versus voltage for HCN2 expressed with and without HA-MiRP1 co-expression.A, the mean I-V relations of HCN2 channels in the presence (n = 16, open circle) and absence (n = 13, filled circle) of HA-MiRP1 co-expression.

To investigate this, we examined several biophysical characteristics of the expressed HCN2 channel. First, we determined the voltage dependence of the expressed current, which reflects the fraction of expressed HCN2 channels in the myocytes that are activated at any individual voltage. We previously did not observe an effect of MiRP1 on HCN2 voltage dependence when co-expressed in oocytes (4Yu H. Wu J. Potapova I. Wymore R.T. Holmes B. Zuckerman J. Pan Z. Wang H. Shi W. Robinson R.B. El-Maghrabi R. Benjamin W. Dixon J. McKinnon D. Cohen I.S. Wymore R. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: e84-e87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but another study did report such an effect for HCN4 co-expression with MiRP1 (5Decher N. Bundis F. Vajna R. Steinmeyer K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To assess the voltage dependence of expressed HCN2 channels, the activation relation was determined directly from the tail currents (Fig. 3A, see inset for voltage clamp protocol). We plotted and normalized the tail currents in relation to the test voltage and fit the result to the Boltzmann function as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3B). The mean V1½2 is –76.7 ± 2.8 mV (n = 16) for HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 versus –73.6 ± 4.5 mV (n = 13) for HCN2 alone (p > 0.05). The corresponding K values are 11.7 ± 0.9 mV (n = 16) and 10.2 ± 0.9 mV (n = 13) respectively (p > 0.05). The mean V1½2 and K values are obtained by averaging the corresponding values from individual myocytes. Thus, HA-MiRP1 co-expression does not alter the voltage dependence of expressed HCN2 channels in myocytes.Fig. 3HA-MiRP1 does not alter HCN2 voltage dependence when co-expressed in myocytes.A, HCN2 current traces from a representative myocyte. The voltage protocol is shown as the inset. The holding potential was –35 mV, and the voltage for the tail current measurement was –125 mV. The hyperpolarizing steps ranged from –45 to –135 mV.

Fig. 4A shows representative HCN2 current traces in the presence and absence of HA-MiRP1. The holding potential was –35 mV, and the hyperpolarizing voltage was –85 mV. It is evident that HCN2 channels activate faster when co-expressed with HA-MiRP1. In addition, when membrane potential was depolarized after stepping to –125 mV to fully activate the HCN2 channels, faster deactivation kinetics of HCN2 channels also were observed with co-expression of HA-MiRP1. Fig. 4B illustrates such accelerated deactivation kinetics of HCN2 channels at –70 mV in the presence of HA-MiRP1. The complete relationship between gating kinetics (both activation and deactivation) and membrane potential is illustrated in Fig. 4C for cells expressing HCN2 with and without HA-MiRP1 co-expression. The differences in the gating kinetics of HCN2 channels expressed with or without HA-MiRP1 are statistically significant, and the kinetics differ significantly at physiologically relevant voltages, between –60 and –95 mV.Fig. 4Effect of HA-MiRP1 co-expression on kinetics of HCN2 activation and deactivation.A, the normalized HCN2 current traces elicited by a hyperpolarizing pulse from –35 to –85 mV to illustrate the activation kinetics.

B, the normalized HCN2 current traces recorded upon depolarization of HCN2 channels to –70 mV from the fully activated state at –125 mV to illustrate the deactivation kinetics in a cell overexpressing HCN2 alone (H) and HCN2 together with HA-MiRP1 (H+M). C, the complete kinetics in relation to membrane potential for HCN2 channel gating. n = 13–14 for the activation of HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 (open circles) co-expression; n = 10–14 for HCN2 expression alone (filled circles); n = 5–6 for the deactivation of HCN2 + HA-MiRP1 (open squares); n = 3–4 for HCN2 expression alone (filled squares). The solid lines are the best fit curves to the equation τ = 1/(A1 * exp(–V/B1) + A2 * exp(V/B)), where τ is the activation or deactivation kinetic time constant, and A1, A2, B1, and B2 are calculated fitting parameters. The two curves differ by analysis of variance; the asterisks indicate voltages that differ by pairwise multiple comparison (Holm-Sidak, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As an additional test of the specificity of the effect of MiRP1 on HCN2 currents, in a separate series of experiments we measured expressed HCN2 in the presence or absence of coexpressed MinK. There was no statistically significant difference in amplitude, midpoint, slope factor, kinetics, or instantaneous component of the expressed pacemaker current (n = 13).HA-MiRP1 Co-assembles with HCN2 as a Protein Complex—We first asked whether native HCN2 and MiRP1 proteins could be detected in neonatal rat ventricle. We used tissue rather than cell cultures in this case and compared neonatal rat ventricle to canine sinoatrial node, because messages for both MiRP1 and HCN are high in this region of the heart. Both HCN2 and MiRP1 were detected in both tissues by immunoprecipitation with anti-HCN2 and anti-MiRP1, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B, left two lanes).Fig. 5Immunoprecipitation of endogenous HCN2 and MiRP1 and interaction of HCN2 with MiRP1.A, canine sinoatrial node (SAN) and rat neonatal ventricle (Neonatal V) as well as membranes of cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes overexpressing GFP or GFP+HCN2 were used for immunoprecipitation of HCN2 by anti-HCN2 antibody. B, canine sinoatrial node and rat neonatal ventricle were used for immunoprecipitation of endogenous MiRP1 by anti-MiRP1 antibody (left panel). Membranes of cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes overexpressing GFP, GFP+HCN2, GFP+HA-MiRP1, or HCN2+HA-MiRP1 were used for immunoprecipitation of MiRP1 by anti-HCN2 antibody (right panel). C, membranes of cultured rat neonatal cardiac myocytes overexpressing GFP, GFP+HA-MiRP1, GFP+HCN2, or HCN2+HA-MiRP1 were used for immunoprecipitation experiments (IP) with antibody specific for HCN2 (middle two panels) or the HA tag of MiRP1 (HA-MiRP1; lower two panels). Expression of heterologously expressed proteins was demonstrated by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies (upper two panels). WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next asked whether we could detect both native and expressed HCN2 in the neonatal ventricle cultures. HCN2 was detected in cultures infected only with AdGFP; however, the quantity of native protein was more than an order of magnitude less than HCN2 in AdHCN2-infected cultures (Fig. 5A, right two lanes). In Fig. 5A, the two bands representing native HCN2 found in canine sinoatrial node and neonatal rat ventricle are slightly shifted with respect to the corresponding bands in HCN2 overexpressing cells. One possibility is that this reflects differences in post-translational processing between native and overexpressed protein. In addition, it should be noted that the gel in Fig. 5A was exposed for a long time to visualize the native HCN2 bands. This resulted in accentuation of an additional diffuse high molecular weight band (Fig. 5C, top panel, far right lane). We do not have an explanation for the appearance of this faint high molecular weight band in the HC"

However, its role in the functions of chaperones of the small heat shock protein families is not understood very well. We report here a study on the role of ATP on the structure and function of the major eye lens chaperone α-crystallin. Our in vitro study shows that at physiological temperature, ATP induces the association of α-crystallin with substrate proteins. The association process is reversible and low affinity in nature with unit binding stoichiometry. 4,4′-Dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt, binding studies show that ATP induces the exposure of additional hydrophobic sites on α-crystallin, but no appreciable enhancement of the same was observed for the substrate protein γ-crystallin or carbonic anhydrase. An equilibrium unfolding study reveals that ATP at 3 mgm concentration stabilizes the α-crystallin structure by 4.5 kJ/mol. The compactness induced by ATP makes it more resistant to tryptic cleavage. ATP-induced association of chaperone α-crystallin with substrate enhanced its aggregation prevention ability and also enhanced the refolding yield of lactate dehydrogenase from the unfolded state. Our results suggest that the binding of ATP to α-crystallin and not its hydrolysis is required for all these effects, as replacement of ATP by its nonhydrolyzable analogue adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), tetralithium salt, reproduced all the results faithfully. The implication of the ATP-induced reversible protein-protein association at physiological temperatures on the functional role of α-crystallin in vivo is discussed.

Both subunits associate to form a large oligomer with an average molecular mass of 800 kDa. It is a key member of the small heat shock protein (sHSP) 1The abbreviations used are: sHSP, small heat shock protein; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt; FITC, fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; ATPγS, adenosine-5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), tetralithium salt; CA, carbonic anhydrase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin. superfamily having a conserved core “α-crystallin domain” (1de Jong W.W.

An important finding that sheds light on the understanding of the function of α-crystallin has been the discovery of its molecular chaperone-like function a decade ago (6Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Despite extensive studies, a number of issues relating to its chaperone function still remain unclear. One such issue concerns the role of ATP in the chaperone function of α-crystallin (16Rawat U. Rao M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9415-9423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kopp S.J. Glonek T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1985; 26: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar). Many well known classical chaperones of the large heat shock protein family, including GroEL, DnaK, etc., function in an ATP-dependent manner (28Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP plays a crucial role in the chaperone-mediated folding of substrate proteins. However, such an activity has been less well documented in the α-crystallin system (23Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus, α-crystallin has been reported to have autophosphorylation activity by some workers (29Kantorow M. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

According to a totally different viewpoint existing in the literature, most sHSPs having the conserved α-crystallin domain have no dependence on ATP for their functions (22Narberhaus F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It has already been established that the yield of several substrates refolded in vitro in the presence of α-crystallin somewhat increased when ATP was present in the system (16Rawat U. Rao M. J.

ATP enhanced the yield of α-crystallin-mediated refolding of citrate synthase (17Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although some workers suggest that ATP binding enhances the chaperone function of α-crystallin (17Muchowski P.J. Clark J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), others suggest that ATP destabilizes the chaperone-substrate complex much the same way as in GroEL system (26Wang K. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6335-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). But there are conflicting views as to the requirement of ATP hydrolysis for these various schemes (16Rawat U. Rao M.

In this paper, we present results that show that ATP exposes hydrophobic sites on the surface of α-crystallin, which triggers reversible association with substrates at physiological temperature. ATP stabilizes the structure of α-crystallin and makes it less sensitive to proteases. The reversible association enhances the chaperone activity of α-crystallin and can also explain the enhancement in the α-crystallin-mediated reactivation yield of unfolded enzymes. Bovine eye lenses were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and were stored at –70 °C. Sephacryl S-300 HR, Sephacryl S-400-HR, carbonic anhydrase (CA), insulin, DNase, lysozyme, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and SDS were all purchased from Sigma. Dithiothreitol (DTT), trypsin, and all buffer salts (tris, phosphate, etc.) were from Sisco Research Laboratories, India. Bis-ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was obtained from Merck. All other chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. αL-Crystallin was purified from bovine eye lenses as described earlier (12Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, eye lenses were homogenized on ice in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 12,000 rpm for 45 min. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a Sephacryl S300-HR column (95 × 1.5 cm). The first peak contained high (αH-) crystallin and the second peak low (αL) crystallin. Further purification was done by using a Sephacryl S400-HR column. SDS-PAGE of purified αL-crystallin showed a single band corresponding to 20 kDa. γ-Crystallin corresponded to the fifth peak (βH- and βL-crystallins were the third and fourth peaks, respectively) of the Sephacryl S300 column. This was further purified through Sephacryl S100-HR (95 × 1.5 cm) column at 25 °C. The purified protein solution became turbid on heating at 60 °C. γ-Crystallin was extensively dialyzed against ammonium bicarbonate buffer (24 g/liter, pH 8.0), lyophilized, and stored at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE showed a single band at 20 kDa. Plasmid DNA of human αA-crystallin construct in pAED4 vector was a gift from Dr. W. W. de Jong of Katholic University, The Netherlands. Plasmid for human αB-crystallin in pET20b+ expression vector was provided as a gift by Dr. J. Horwitz of the Jules Stein Eye Institute, Los Angeles. For overexpression, both the plasmids were separately introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21-DE3. Cultures were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside induction. Cells were centrifuged, subjected to freeze-thaw treatment, and then extracted with DNase and lysozyme. Proteins were dialyzed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm DTT (buffer A), concentrated in an Amicon stirred cell, applied to a DEAE-anion exchange column, and eluted with linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradients. αA- and αB-crystallin fractions were then applied to Sephacryl S300-HR size exclusion column (1.5 × 90 cm) and eluted with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. Main peak fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against buffer A or 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5 mm DTT and stored in aliquots at –70 °C. SDS-PAGE of both αA- and αB-crystallin showed a single band around 20 kDa. Concentration of recombinant proteins was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 280 nm by using extinction coefficients of 0.83 and 0.95 (mg/ml)–1 cm–1 for αA- and αB-crystallin, respectively (32Horwitz J. Huang Q.L. Ding L. Bova M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Molar concentration of all α-crystallins was always expressed in subunit basis. Membrane Filtration Method—We incubated 12.5 μm αA-, αB-, or αL-crystallin with 2–25 μm bovine γ-crystallin or CA in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in the absence and presence of 3 mm ATP at 25, 37, 45, and 55 °C for 1 h. No protein aggregation was observed under these conditions. The solutions were cooled back to 25 °C for 1 h. Unbound substrate was then separated by centrifugation at 4000 × g through a 100-kDa Microcon (Amicon) filter membrane. The amount of substrate remaining associated with α-crystallin was calculated from the concentration of total substrate and free substrate; both were determined by the Bradford assay using BSA as standard. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Since the presence of ATP interfered with the 280-nm UV peak of the substrate proteins obtained with the analytical TSK-GEL G3000SWXL column, we used FITC-labeled γ-crystallin for these experiments. The FITC labeling method was described earlier (33Bhattacharyya J. Das K.P. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 249-258PubMed Google Scholar) where we also showed that covalent tagging of FITC to bovine γ-crystallin did not change its gel filtration property or the chaperone function of α-crystallin. The mixture of α-crystallin and γ-crystallin (12.5 μm each in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) with and without 3 mm ATP, after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h followed by cooling to 25 °C as mentioned above, was injected (20 μl) into the column (30 cm × 7.8 mm, 5 μm). The column was run at 0.5 ml/min in the equilibrating buffer (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.2) that contained 3 mm ATP for ATP-containing samples only, and the chromatogram was monitored by the FITC signal at 494 nm. The area of the peaks was calculated by using the HPLC instrument software (Waters). α-Crystallin (2.5 μm) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the absence and presence of 3 mm ATP in a 3-ml fluorimeter cuvette placed inside a Hitachi 4500 spectrofluorometer maintained at the incubation temperature by using a water bath. The solution was titrated with 300 μm bis-ANS by adding a small aliquot at a time. After each addition, the solution was stirred magnetically for 1 min, and fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded between 450 and 550 nm by using 390 nm as the excitation wavelength. The excitation and emission bandpasses were 5 nm each. In order to analyze the data according to the Scatchard equation, a titration of 0.2 μm bis-ANS by 10.0 mg/ml α-crystallin or 4.0 mg/ml γ-crystallin was performed. The reverse titration data were used to obtain the quantitative relationship between fluorescence intensity change and bound bis-ANS, according to Cardamone and Puri (34Cardamone M. Puri B.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The enhancement in structural stability of α-crystallin by ATP was measured by comparing the trypsin digestibility of αA-crystallin in the absence and presence of 3 mm ATP. αA-crystallin (1 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) was incubated with trypsin at 50:1 and 100:1 (w/w) ratios at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at different digestion times, and the reaction was stopped immediately by adding soybean trypsin inhibitor. SDS-PAGE of the αA-crystallin digest was performed under reducing conditions in a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN 3 electrophoresis set up by using linear 8–16% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Silver staining was used to detect the bands. Gels were scanned in a densitometer for quantitative analysis. The enhancement of the stability of αA-crystallin in the presence of ATP was also determined by equilibrium chemical denaturation experiments. αA-crystallin solutions (0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) were incubated at 37 °C in various urea concentrations in the range 0–7 m for 18 h. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of all solutions were taken in the 300–400-nm region using 295 nm as excitation wavelength and 5 nm each for excitation and emission bandpass. The equilibrium unfolding profile was fitted according to the three-state model as described by Das et al. (35Das B.K. Bhattacharyya T. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5242-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The chaperone-like activity of recombinant human αB-crystallin in the absence and in the presence of 3 mm ATP was studied by using DTT-induced aggregation of insulin (12Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.35 mg/ml insulin in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in the absence and presence of 0.175 mg/ml αB-crystallin was preincubated with 3 mm ATP at 37 °C for 1 h. Aggregation was initiated by adding freshly prepared DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm, and the apparent absorbance at 400 nm was monitored at the kinetic mode using a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectro-photometer maintained at 37 °C. Assays were also done using recombinant αA-and bovine αL-crystallin. Chaperone activity was also assayed by measuring the α-crystallin-mediated refolding of LDH, a homotetrameric enzyme from its fully unfolded state. LDH was denatured in 6 m GdnHCl for 8 h at 25 °C at a concentration of 1 μm. Refolding of the enzyme was initiated by diluting the denatured LDH 100-fold in a refolding buffer, pH 7.2, consisting of 50 mm phosphate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm DTT, 30 μm αB-crystallin, and 3 mm ATP or ATPγS. Control experiments without αB-crystallin and/or ATP were also done. The enzyme concentration was 10 nm during refolding. The activity of refolded enzyme was assayed by adding 20 μl of refolding mixture to 580 μl of refolding buffer mentioned above containing 0.1 mm NADH and 0.4 mm sodium pyruvate preincubated at 37 °C and by measuring the decrease at A340 with time. Monitoring of Binding by Membrane Filtration—When a mixture of αA-crystallin homo-oligomer and monomeric γ-crystallin, 12.5 μm each, was incubated at 37 °C and the mixture passed through a 100-kDa membrane, all of the γ-crystallin came through. But when the mixture was incubated in presence of 3 mm ATP, about 45% of the γ-crystallin was retained over the membrane. We carefully considered the possibility of aggregation of the substrate proteins in the presence of ATP, but we found no evidence for it at the conditions used for our experiments. Thus, the results indicated that ATP triggered association between the chaperone αA-crystallin and its substrate γ-crystallin. If the chaperone αA-crystallin is replaced by BSA in such an experiment, no binding between BSA and γ-crystallin was observed in the presence of ATP, indicating that the chaperone is required for this interaction. Equilibrating 12.5 μm of αA-crystallin with varying concentrations (2–25 μm) of γ-crystallin in the presence of 3 mm ATP, a binding isotherm (Fig. 1A) was constructed after determining the unbound and bound concentration of substrate (S) by membrane filtration. By assuming a single binding site per subunit of the chaperone (C), the dissociation constant (Kd) of the complex (CS) for the process CS = C + S is given by Equation 1, Kd=(Co−So+S)·S(So−S) (Eq. 1) where Co and So indicate the total concentration of the chaperone and substrate, respectively, and S indicates the equilibrium concentration of the substrate in the mixture. Equation 1 can be rearranged to give Equation 2. [ CoSo−S=1+KdS (Eq. 2) The dissociation constant obtained from the slope of the linear plot of Co/(So – S) against 1/S (Fig. 1B) was 8.2 μm. The data were also analyzed by the Scatchard equation (Equation 3), assuming n identical noninteracting sites per subunit of the chaperone, ν˜=n−Kdν˜S (Eq. 3) where ν˜ is the number of moles of substrate bound per mol of chaperone; n is the number of binding sites, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The stoichiometry n and Kd values obtained from the plot of ν˜/S against ν˜ (Fig. 1C) is 0.84 per subunit of αA-crystallin and 7.4 μm, respectively. The results obtained by single site model (n = 1) as described by Equations 1 and 2 and the identical multiple site model (Equation 3) thus yielded very similar results, within the limits of experimental error, indicating that the single site model is a good description of the binding phenomena. The Kd value obtained for the ATP-induced binding between the chaperone and substrate suggests a low affinity interaction under the experimental conditions. The dissociation constant of the ATP-induced binding between the α-crystallin chaperone and substrate under various conditions has been computed (see Table I) according to the single site model using Equation 1.Table IDetermination of Kd values for the different systems in the absence and presence of 3.0 mm ATP at different temperaturesSystem studiedTemperatureKd, μm,aValues were determined by using Equation 1.

Open table in a new tab We have used recombinant αA- and αB-crystallin and bovine αL-crystallin as chaperone and γ-crystallin and carbonic anhydrase as substrates. In all cases, binding between the chaperone and substrate was observed in the presence of ATP at 37 °C. In absence of ATP at this temperature, the substrate proteins remained largely (85–98%) unbound (Fig. 2). Only a small amount of substrate (2–15%) was involved in an extremely low affinity binding having Kd values in the hundreds of micromolar range (Table I). However, in the presence of ATP at 37 °C, unbound substrates dropped in the range of 40–60%, indicating a significant amount of substrates remained bound to α-crystallin. This enhanced binding in the presence of ATP was clearly indicated by a more than 1 order of magnitude decrease in Kd values in the presence of ATP at 37 °C (Table I). It is of interest that the affinity of binding of a substrate to αB-crystallin is higher than that to αA-crystallin (Table I). When ATP is replaced by its nonhydrolyzable analogue ATPγS at 37 °C, a similar result was obtained (Fig. 2), indicating that ATP hydrolysis is not required for promoting the substrate-α-crystallin association. We observed that the complex once formed in the presence of ATP at 37 °C or higher temperatures remained stable even when the temperature was reduced to 25 °C. However, removal of ATP from the complex by dialysis induced slow dissociation and extensive dialysis fully dissociated the complex indicating its reversible character with respect to ATP concentration. Enhanced Substrate Binding Capacity of α-Crystallin at Various ATP Concentrations and Temperatures—Binding between various α-crystallins and its substrate proteins was found to be ATP concentration-dependent. A typical result of the association between recombinant human αA-crystallin and γ-crystallin at 37 °C as a function of the concentration of ATP is shown in Fig. 3A. The association constant is increased from 0.065 (Kd = 15.4 μm) to 0.11 μm–1 (Kd = 9.1 μm) as the ATP concentration is increased from 0.2 to 3 mm above where it tends to level off. A very similar dependence on ATP concentration was also observed for the chaperone-substrate binding when either αB-crystallin or αL-crystallin was used as chaperone (data not shown). The effect of ATP on substrate binding was also dependent on temperature. In the absence of ATP there is negligible binding between α-crystallin and its substrate at 37 °C and below. Binding is, however, enhanced in the presence of ATP at all temperatures. We define “binding enhancement” by ATP as the difference in percentage binding of the substrate in the presence and the absence of ATP at a given temperature. A typical result of the binding enhancement for the (αA-γ) and (αA-γ)-crystallin system, at 3 mm ATP, as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 3B. No enhancement was observed at 25 °C for both systems. The enhancement rose to ∼40% at 37 °C, ∼43% at 45 °C, and ∼45% at 55 °C for αA-crystallin. A similar trend was also observed for binding between αB-crystallin and γ-crystallin, but the enhancements were 12–18% higher in the 37–55 °C range than the values observed for αA-crystallin. Fig. 3B also shows that although the binding enhancement increased somewhat beyond 37 °C, 80–90% of maximum enhancement was achieved at the physiological temperature. Binding between α-crystallin and CA was also enhanced as indicated at all the t"

Some of these functions require specific membrane localization. Although several voltage-gated channels are known to interact with intracellular proteins exerting auxiliary functions, no cytoplasmic proteins have been found so far to modulate HCN channels. Through the use of a yeast two-hybrid technique, here we showed that filamin A interacts with HCN1, an HCN isoform widely expressed in the brain, but not with HCN2 or HCN4. Filamin A is a cytoplasmic scaffold protein with actin-binding domains whose main function is to link transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton. Using several HCN1 C-terminal constructs, we identified a filamin A-interacting region of 22 amino acids located downstream from the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain; this region is not conserved in HCN2, HCN3, or HCN4. We also verified by immunoprecipitation from bovine brain that the filamin A-HCN1 interaction is functional in vivo. In filamin A-expressing cells (filamin+), HCN1 (but not HCN4) channels were expressed in hot spots, whereas they were evenly distributed on the membrane of cells lacking filamin A (filamin–) indicating that interaction with filamin A affects membrane localization. Also, in filamin– cells the gating kinetics of HCN1 were strongly accelerated relative to filamin+ cells. The interaction with filamin A may contribute to localizing HCN1 channels to specific neuronal areas and to modulating channel activity.

The hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current If/Ih has an established role in underlying generation and neurotransmitter-mediated modulation of cardiac pacemaker activity (1DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) and control of excitability and other functions, including integration of synaptic activity and modulation of synaptic strength, in several different types of neurons (2Pape H.C.

The molecular correlates of f/h channels are the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, of which four isoforms (HCN1–4) are known. When expressed alone in heterologous systems, HCN channels elicit currents whose properties are qualitatively similar to those of native If/Ih currents, although they differ quantitatively in kinetics and cAMP sensitivity (4Viscomi C.

Recently, several studies have addressed the problem of the distribution of HCN isoforms in different cell types. HCN1, the first HCN isoform to be cloned (6Santoro B. Grant S.G. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14815-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), is extensively expressed in the brain with a selective distribution in specific brain areas. It is expressed for example in the layer 5 neocortical neurons, in the CA1, and to a lower degree, CA3 hippocampal regions, in the molecular cell layer of the cerebellum, and in the superior colliculus (3Robinson R.B. Siegelbaum S.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 453-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 7Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Interestingly, in some of the tissues of expression such as the neocortex, the retina, the hippocampus, and the taste receptors, the HCN1 isoform was found to be present in specific cell types and/or in specific subcellular compartments (e.g. the inner segment of rods and the cortical dendrites of CA1 hippocampal neurons) both at the RNA and protein levels (10Magee J.C.

Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2886-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and with scaffolding proteins, which co-localize channels and regulatory components in subcellular compartments for improved efficiency of channel modulation (16Prat A.G.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether HCN1 channels interact with partner proteins in the brain and to check whether existing associations with any such proteins have a role in the specific cellular localization of the channels and modulation of channel function. We used the C terminus of mouse HCN1 (mHCN1), because this contains specific sequences for protein-protein interaction (including PDZ and SH3 1The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; aa, amino acid; MEM, minimal Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; m, mouse; h, human; CNBD, cyclic-nucleotide binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; pS, picosiemens; pF, picofarad; domains), to screen a mouse brain cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid assay. We found that HCN1 associates with several proteins and specifically with filamin A, a high molecular mass cytoskeletal protein known to anchor different transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton and to act as a scaffold for various signaling proteins. Yeast Two-hybrid System—We used the Matchmaker two-hybrid system 3 to screen a library of mouse brain cDNA inserted in pACT2 (Clontech), with a portion of the C terminus of mHCN1 in pGBKT7 as a bait (see below). The surviving clones were identified by PCR; the primers for amplification were mapped in pACT2, forward, 5′-CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC-3′) and reverse, 5′-GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGA-3′. The proteins thus amplified included: filamin A (retrieved 8 times); Ral A (a protein of the Rho family of GTPases, (19Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar)) (retrieved twice); GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor, (20Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar)) (retrieved once). Filamin A was selected for further analysis. Constructs—To identify the shortest filamin A-interacting site of mHCN1, we made several constructs of mHCN1 C-terminal portions in pGKT7, as outlined. 1) aa 657–910, we cut pEGFPC1-mHCN1 with AccI (blunt) and BamHI, and the resulting fragment was inserted into pGBKT7 EcoRI (blunt) and BamHI; 2) aa 657–858 and aa 859–910, the inserts coding for these two stretches were obtained by cutting the pGBKT7-mHCN1 C terminus (construct 1) with EcoRI, AflIII, and with AflIII and BamHI, respectively; 3) aa 657–791, we inserted a stop codon (TGA) in construct 1 (aa 790) using three PCR cycles. The primers used were F1 and R3 (first cycle), F3 and R2 (second cycle), and F1 and R2 (third cycle) (see below sequence of primers; 4) aa 657–715, construct 1 was cut with EcoRI and PvuII, and the fragment was reinserted into pGBKT7 (EcoRI and SmaI); 5) aa 657–693, construct 1 was cut with PstI, and the vector was ligated; 6) aa 694–715, two partially overlapping oligonucleotides covering this region and carrying two restriction sites were annealed in vitro, blunted with a Klenow polymerase, and digested with NcoI/BamHI; the final product was cloned into the pGBKT7 plasmid; 7) aa 657–910 with the mutation PSLP → ASAA (aa 814–817), we used three PCR cycles with the primers F1 and R1 (first cycle), F2 and R2 (second cycle), and F1 and R2 (third cycle). 8) aa 657–715 with the mutation PP → AA (aa 695–696), the C terminus of HCN1 was amplified by PCR from aa 694 to a 715 using a mutagenic forward primer, and the product was then cloned into the PstI restriction site of aa 657–715. The primers used for protocols 3 and 7 were F1, 5′-ATCTCAGAGGAGGACCTGCATA-3′; R1, 5′-CTCATGGGCCGCAGAAGCCTG-3′; F2, 5′-CAGGCTTCTGCGGCCCATGAG-3′; R2, 5′-GTTATGCGGCCGCTGCAGGT-3′; F3, 5′-TGAAGTGCACAAGTGAAGCACA-3′; R3, 5′-TGTGCTTCACTTGTGCACTTCA-3′. All constructs were sequenced by MWG AG (Ebersberg). We used the above constructs to transform the AH109 yeast strain, whereas the Y187 yeast strain was transformed with pGADT7-filamin A. The two strains were then mixed and plated according to the “yeast mating” method to verify the interaction found by the screening procedure and identify minimum interacting sites. For positive- and negative-interaction controls, we used the large T-antigen vector with the p53 and the laminin vectors, respectively. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—We performed transcription/translation of the mHCN1 constructs generated by the above protocols and of filamin A by TnT Quick-Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). All mHCN1 constructs were inserted in pGBKT7 and filamin A was inserted in pGADT7 (Clontech). [35S]Methionine radiolabeled protein was obtained by an in vitro system based on mammalian reticulocyte lysate (TnT Quick Master Mix, Promega) to which plasmidic cDNA and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) were added. Each sample (final volume of 50 μl) was incubated for 60–90 min at 30 °C. Cell Transfection—The A7 (filamin+ or actin-binding protein+) and M2 (filamin– or ABP–) cells (21Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) were incubated in a culture medium (MEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% MEM non-essential AA solution (Sigma), 2% MEM vitamin solution (Sigma), 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution (Sigma). The day before transfection cells were detached by gentle shaking in a 0.5 g/liter trypsin solution and plated on 35-mm Petri dishes at 70% confluence. A7 and M2 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFPC1-mHCN1 or pEGFPC1-hHCN4 (2 μg in each Petri dish) using a LipofectAMINE-based protocol (Invitrogen). After growing for 2 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2, the cells were separated by trypsinization and replated at a lower density for electrophysiology and fluorescence. GFP Fluorescence—Cells transfected as described above were treated with cycloheximide (Sigma) 50 μg/ml and kept for 4 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator to block protein synthesis (22Pedrazzini E. Villa A. Borgese N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4207-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C three times and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 5 min at 4 °C; this was followed by a treatment with a quenching solution (0.1 m glycine/phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed again with a 20 mm phosphate buffer and harvested on glass coverslips with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting medium. After fixation, cells were observed by confocal microscopy (TCS Laica) with sections at ∼4-μm intervals. Immunoprecipitation and Membrane Preparation—We homogenized 10 g of adult bovine brain in 30 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, sucrose 320 mm, 0.5% v/v protease inhibitor (Sigma), pH 7.4, with a tissue grinder and a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes). After a first centrifugation (2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), the pellet (P1) was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C). The newly formed pellet (P2) was dissolved into 15 ml of a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% v/v protease inhibitor, 1% v/v Triton X-100 (Sigma), pH 7.4, and stirred for 20 min on ice. After a further centrifugation (20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C), the insoluble pellet (P3) was eliminated, and the supernatant used for the immunoprecipitation protocol. For immunoprecipitation, 400 μg of soluble membrane proteins were dissolved in 0.5 ml of water and incubated with Ab anti-filamin (MAB 1680, Chemicon) overnight at 4 °C on a rotary shaker. The following day we added 25 μg of protein G-Sepharose beads (P-3296, Sigma), incubated for 2 h, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then washed three times with a buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, Triton X-100 1%, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with anti-HCN1 antibody (Alomone Labs) for blotting. A7 and M2 cells used for immunoprecipitation were grown in 10-cm Petri dishes, transfected as described above, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped from the bottom, and then extracts from three dishes were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% v/v protease inhibitor (Sigma) and homogenized. Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above for brain extracts. For the immunoprecipitation of proteins obtained by the in vitro transcription/translation procedure described above, individual mHCN1 constructs were either used alone or mixed (as baits) with filamin A (as prey) for 1 h at room temperature. Protocols for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA (Santa Cruz) and anti-c-Myc antibodies (Sigma) were as described above. The gel was treated with a gel fixation solution (50% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, 40% water) and exposed to autoradiography to reveal the presence of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. Electrophysiology—M2 and A7 cells were washed once in Tyrode solution, placed under a fluorescent microscope, and superfused at room temperature with Tyrode. Only fluorescent cells were chosen for recording. The Tyrode solution was composed as follows (in mm): NaCl, 140; KCl, 5.4; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 1; d-glucose, 5.5; Hepes-NaOH, 5, pH 7.4. During whole-cell recording, the perfusing solution was switched to a high K+ solution containing (mm): NaCl, 110; KCl, 30; CaCl2, 1.8; MgCl2, 0.5; Hepes-NaOH, 5; 1 BaCl2, 1; MnCl2, 2; NiCl2, 0.1; nifedipine, 0.02, pH 7.4. The intracellular-like solution contained (mm): KCl, 130; NaCl, 10; EGTA-KOH, 1; MgCl2, 0.5; ATP (sodium salt), 2; creatine phosphate, 5; GTP (sodium salt), 0.1; Hepes-KOH, 5, pH 7.2. From a holding potential of –20 mV, hyperpolarizing steps in the range of –25 to –125 mV followed by a step at –135 mV were applied to measure activation curves in standard two-step protocols. Tail currents at –135 mV were normalized to plot activation curves. Single activation curves were fitted to the Boltzmann equation y = (1/(1 + exp((V – V½)/s), where V is voltage, V½ is half-maximum activation potential, and s is the inverse slope factor, to yield V½ and s values, which were then averaged. Deactivation traces were recorded by fully activating the current at –135 mV and then stepping to the range of –55 to 45 mV for a time long enough to reach steady-state. Time constants were calculated by fitting activation/deactivation traces to a monoexponential function after an initial delay (5Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the values were averaged and plotted against voltage. Conductances were normalized to cell capacitance, measured by a specific 10-mV step protocol. Values are given as the mean ± S.E. throughout. Statistical analysis was performed by a t test comparison with a significance level set to p = 0.05. cDNA Screening by Yeast Two-hybrid System—We screened over 4 million proteins using the final portion of the mHCN1 C terminus (aa 657–910) as a bait and found ∼40 hypothetical interacting partners. Of these 40 proteins, some were retrieved more often than others. To check for true versus false positives, we performed a yeast mating assay on a high stringency medium, which led to the identification of three proteins that were confirmed to bind to the HCN1 bait, Ral A (Ras-like GTPase, a protein of the Rho family of GTPases) (19Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) (20Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and filamin A, retrieved 2, 1, and 8 times, respectively. We focused our attention on filamin A. The interaction of filamin A with HCN1 in yeast is shown in Fig. 1A. Filamin A, or actin-binding protein, is a large 280-kDa cytoskeletal protein carrying an actin-binding site at the N terminus, 24 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like repeats, and two hinge regions linking repeats 15 and 16 and repeats 23 and 24 (23Van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. BBA-Mol. Cell Res. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Filamin A acts as a dimer and, because of its specific structure, behaves as a scaffold protein. For example it can assemble broad macrocomplexes by binding a variety of proteins such as membrane receptors (e.g. D2 and D3 dopamine receptor), phosphatases (e.g. SHIP-2), ion channels (e.g. Kv4.2 potassium channel), monomeric G-proteins (e.g. Ral A), and structural proteins (e.g. β1-integrin and caveolin-1) (17Petrecca K.

Fig. 1B shows the schematic structure of filamin A and the shortest C-terminal segment rescued by the HCN1 bait with the screening protocol (bottom segment, repeats 23 and 24). Immunoprecipitation from Bovine Brain—We proceeded to test whether filamin A and HCN1 also interact in vivo in a mammalian system, and specifically in the central nervous system where both proteins are highly expressed. Using specific anti-filamin A antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”), we immunoprecipitated filamin A from 400 μg of membrane proteins extracted from a bovine brain. The immunoprecipitated and total membrane proteins were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. In Fig. 2, the filamin A-immunoprecipitated proteins (lane 1) yielded a strong band near 116 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the HCN1 isoform (12Moroni A. Gorza L. Beltrame M. Gravante B. Vaccari T. Bianchi M.E. Altomare C. Longhi R. Heurteaux C. Vitadello M. Malgaroli A. DiFrancesco D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29233-29241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as detected by isoform-specific antibodies. As a control, the same signal was confirmed in the total membrane proteins before immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2, lane 2). For further control, we verified the presence (Fig. 2, lane 3) and specificity (lane 4, primary antibody omitted) of the filamin A signal in the filamin A-immunoprecipitated proteins. Also, HCN1 was not detected by incubating the same extract with a preimmune serum (Fig. 2, lane 5) or by omitting the primary HCN1 antibody (lane 6 compared with lane 7 in the presence of primary antibody). Protein-Protein Interaction Assay: Mating and in Vitro Transcription/Translation—To identify the minimum filamin A-interacting portion of mHCN1 and to investigate whether HCN isoforms other than HCN1 could bind filamin A, we performed a yeast mating assay (Fig. 3). This was achieved by transforming the (MATα) Y187 yeast strain with filamin A and the (MATa) AH109 strain with different C-terminal portions of either mHCN1 or with the C termini of mHCN2 or hHCN4 (see Table I and Fig. 3 legend). Yeasts were then plated in high stringency conditions allowing yeast growth only under condition of strong interaction between constructs.Table ISummary of the HCN C-terminal constructs used to test for interaction with filamin AHCN constructsYeast two-hybridIn vitro T/THCN1aa 657-910+++Yesaa 657-910 mut+++Yesaa 859-910—Noaa 657-858+++Yesaa 657-791+++Yesaa 657-715++Yesaa 657-693—Noaa 694-715++aa 657-715 mut++HCN2aa 429-709—HCN4aa 756-1204— Open table in a new tab In Fig. 3, A–K, a collection of yeast mating combinations of filamin A and HCN C-terminal sequences is shown. Fig. 3A represents the C-terminal portion of mHCN1 used as a control for screening (aa 657–910, where 910 is the last amino acid of the mHCN1 protein), which clearly interacts with filamin A. This portion contains a PXXP motif conserved among the HCN isoforms 1, 2, 3, and 4 (812PSLP815 in mHCN1), a sequence known to bind SH3 domains and to be involved in some cases in filamin A binding (6Santoro B. Grant S.G. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14815-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 17Petrecca K. Miller D.M. Shrier A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8736-8744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although filamin A does not contain SH3 domains. We therefore first checked whether or not this putative consensus site could be responsible for the interaction between mHCN1 and filamin A and replaced by mutagenesis amino acids PSLP with ASAA, a substitution known to affect filamin A-protein interactions (17Petrecca K. Miller D.M. Shrier A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8736-8744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). The yeasts were able to grow normally indicating that this sequence is not necessary for interaction. We also noted that the C-terminal part of mHCN1 includes a consensus sequence, conserved among all HCN isoforms (not shown), for PDZ domains (aa 907–910, XSXL), which are known to be involved in the organization of supramolecular complexes and protein scaffolding (29Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). To check for a potential interacting site with filamin A in this region, we generated a small fragment from the C-terminal part of the protein (aa 859–910) containing the PDZ consensus site. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, this fragment did not interact with filamin A, whereas its complementary sequence (aa 657–858) did indicating that the PDZ consensus site is not responsible for this interaction. We then proceeded to shorten the test sequence of mHCN1 from the control aa 657–910 portion and prepared four truncated constructs to identify a shorter interacting region, as shown in Fig. 3, E–H (see also Table I). This approach revealed that the 22-aa-long sequence comprised between aa 694 and 715 (SPPIQSPLATRTFHYASPTASQ) is necessary for the interaction. Because proline-rich sequences may contribute to protein-protein interactions (for example with WW domains), we mutated the diproline tract 695–696 to AA in the sequence aa 657–715; the mutation did not disrupt the interaction (Fig. 3I), ruling against an involvement of this tract in the binding with filamin A. The sequence aa 694–715 is not conserved in any of the other HCN isoforms (HCN2, HCN3, HCN4). This was verified by performing multiple sequence alignments with ClustalW as well as a search of homologous sequences with BLAST, and neither method provided significant alignment scores (not shown). In agreement with this observation, the HCN2 and HCN4 regions homologous to the HCN1 aa 657–910 control sequence (spanning from the C-terminal ends of the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) downstream from the C termini of HCN2 or HCN4, see “Experimental Procedures”) did not interact with filamin A (Fig. 3, J and K). The filamin A-interacting sequence was downstream from the CNBD in mHCN1 (Fig. 3L). As a way to confirm the results above, we also checked for protein-protein interactions using in vitro transcription and translation of the various constructs to which either a HA or c-myc tag was fused in-frame (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In Fig. 4A, filamin A translated in vitro with [35S]methionine was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody, and its presence was revealed by autoradiography (left lane, as labeled). Similarly, the mHCN1 control sequence (aa 657–910) fused to c-myc was translated in vitro and immunoprecipitated using an anti-c-myc antibody, and its presence was revealed (Fig. 4A, center lane, as labeled). The two proteins were then mixed together, and the immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-c-myc antibody (Fig. 4A, right lane). Autoradiography confirmed the presence of filamin A in the pellet. In Fig. 4, B–G, similar experiments were carried out using the same constructs as in Fig. 3, C–H (as indicated). Once again, the region between amino acids 694 and 715 was the shortest one yielding positive interaction. The data from the yeast mating assay and the in vitro transcription/translation assay are summarized in Table I. To investigate the role of the interaction between filamin A and mHCN1, we performed fluorescence and electrophysiological experiments by transiently transfecting the mHCN1 isoform in-frame with GFP in a melanoma cell line lacking filamin A (filamin– or M2 cells) and compared the results with those obtained with the same cell line stably expressing the filamin A clone (filamin+ or A7 cells) (17Petrecca K. Miller D.M. Shrier A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8736-8744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). We first verified by immunoprecipitation that filamin A is expressed in A7 but not in M2 cells (Fig. 5A, top) and that mHCN1 and filamin A, as expected, co-immunoprecipitate in A7 but not in M2 cells (Fig. 5A, left). The interaction was specific, because no signal was detected when untransfected cells were incubated with the anti-HCN1 antibody (Fig. 5A, bottom right). In Fig. 5, B and C, microphotographs of typical A7 Fig. 5B and M2 cells Fig. 5C expressing the mHCN1-GFP protein are shown. There is a significant level of protein expression in"
https://openalex.org/W2022482636,"A study of gene silencing within the mating-type region of fission yeast defines two distinct pathways responsible for the establishment of heterochromatin assembly. One is RNA interference-dependent and acts on centromere-homologous repeats (cenH). The other is a stochastic Swi6 (the fission yeast HP1 homolog)-dependent mechanism that is not fully understood. Here we find that activating transcription factor (Atf1) and Pcr1, the fission yeast bZIP transcription factors homologous to human ATF-2, are crucial for proper histone deacetylation of both H3 and H4. This deacetylation is a prerequisite for subsequent H3 lysine 9 methylation and Swi6-dependent heterochromatin assembly across the rest of the silent mating-type (mat) region lacking the RNA interference-dependent cenH repeat. Moreover, Atf1 and Pcr1 can form complexes with both a histone deacetylase, Clr6, and Swi6, and clr6 mutations affected the H3/H4 acetylation patterns, similar to the atf1 and pcr1 deletion mutant phenotypes at the endogenous mat loci and at the ctt1+ promoter region surrounding ATF/CRE-binding site. These data suggest that Atf1 and Pcr1 participate in an early step essential for heterochromatin assembly at the mat locus and silencing of transcriptional targets of Atf1. Furthermore, a phosphorylation event catalyzed by the conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is important for regulation of heterochromatin silencing by Atf1 and Pcr1.

Lyakhovetsky R. Cohen A. Genetics. 2000; 156: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar). The cenH region, which shares strong homology with the dg and dh centromeric elements, is a heterochromatin nucleation center and requires the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery similar to centromeric silencing (9Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I. Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The cenH-mediated silencing via the RNAi machinery is required for initial formation of heterochromatin but not for its maintenance. In addition, it has been revealed that flanking sequences present in the KΔ strain, which lacks the cenH-containing K region, are capable of recruiting and maintaining H3 Lys-9 methylation only in the presence of Swi6. Moreover, heterochromatin formation at the mat2/3 region eventually occurs even without the RNAi-dependent cenH element, suggesting the existence of an additional RNAi-independent Swi6-based mechanism for heterochromatin assembly (9Hall I.M.

Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar).ATF/CREB family proteins are among the conserved effector molecules that are regulated by the stress-activated MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade. In fission yeast, Atf1 and Pcr1, members of ATF/CREB family, are phosphorylated by the stress-activated Wis1 (MAPK kinase) and Sty1/Spc1 (MAPK) protein kinases, and this phosphorylation induces transcriptional activation of target genes (23Gaits F.

Moreover, many lines of evidence suggest potential roles for ATF/CREB family proteins in chromatin remodeling and gene silencing (28Hirota K. Hasemi T. Yamada T. Mizuno K. Hoffman C.S. Shibata T.

Although deletion of two potential ATF/CRE-binding sites upstream of the mat3-M locus had a slight effect on heterochromatin silencing (21Thon G. Bjerling K.P. Nielsen I.S. Genetics. 1999; 151: 945-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is still no clear evidence addressing the function of Atf1 and Pcr1 in heterochromatin silencing.Here we describe how the ATF/CREB transcription factors regulate a Swi6-dependent heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast. We find that cooperation of the ATF/CREB transcription factors with common silencing factors including histone deacetylase Clr6 and Swi6 protein is important for histone deacetylation and H3 Lys-9 methylation via an additional RNAi-independent, Swi6-dependent mechanism that acts across the rest of the silent mat locus in the absence of cenH repeats.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedia, Strains, and Plasmids—Fission yeast media and genetic methods have been described previously (31Alfa C.

To assay silencing in vivo, we used reporter strains, which contain ade6+ gene inserted at the outer repeat of centromere 1 (Hu50), adjacent to mat3 (Hu51) and close to the telomere of minichromosomes (Hu60), SacI and BglII site of L region (AP136 and AP144, respectively), and ura4+ gene placed close to mat3 (PG9).

The cDNA was synthesized by using the Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with oligo (dT)15. The cDNAs were PCR-amplified by using primers 5′-GGGTTCCCCTATTTCCTACG-3′ and 5′-TCTCCACATCTCTCCAACCA-3′ for Mc transcripts, 5′-ATGGAAGAAGAAATCGCAGCG-3′ and 5′-TGGAGATCCACATCTGTTGG-3′ for act1 transcripts, and 5′-TGAAAAAGCAGGCCAAGAG-3′ and 5′-ACCGGGAATGGACAGAGAAC-3′ for ade6+ or ade6-DN/N (35Ekwall K. Olsson T. Turner B.M. Cranston G. Allshire R.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 1021-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), and the products were resolved by 6% PAGE and exposed to x-ray film or a PhosphorImager (BAS1500, Fuji).Silencing Test—Cell viability (plating efficiency) and colony color assays were performed to estimate the level of expression of the reporter gene placed at heterochromatic regions as described (20Ayoub N. Goldshmidt I. Cohen A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 495-508PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ekwall K. Olsson T. Turner B.M. Cranston G. Allshire R.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 1021-1032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). 10-Fold dilutions of overnight cultures cells were plated on YES, EMM, and adenine-free (–Ade) plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days and were then photographed. For ade6-off to ade6-on transition assay, each red colony (ade6-off) was picked and transferred onto YE plates, and then colonies were counted after 3–4 days. Colonies with more than 50% white sector (ade6-on) and less than 50% red sector were scored as half-sectored colonies, and the rate was calculated by dividing the number of half-sectored colonies by the total red and half-sectored colonies. For transition assay of KΔ::ade6+ strains in Fig. 5, each white colony with indicated vectors was picked and transferred onto low adenine EMM plates, and then colonies were counted after 3–4 days. The transition rate was calculated by dividing the number of sectored or red colonies by the total number of colonies. For each transition assay, more than three independent experiments were carried out, and more than a thousand colonies were counted.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—ChIP analysis was performed as described elsewhere (36Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Cells (300 ml) were grown to a density of 107 cells/ml and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine. Cells were harvested and washed twice with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and lysed with glass beads in FA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture). The chromatin was sheared by sonication eight times for 20 s with a peak power at 12 μm. Atf1-HA, Pcr1-HA, and histone H3 methylated at Lys-9 were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Applied Science), anti-trimethyl-Lys-9 H3 antibody (Ab8898, Abcam), anti-dimethyl-Lys-4 H3 antibody (07-030, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-acetyl-Lys-9 H3 antibody (07-352, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-acetyl-Lys-4 H3 antibody (07-353, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-acetyl-Lys-5 H4 antibody (Ab1758, Abcam), anti-acetyl-Lys-8 H4 antibody (Ab1760, Abcam), anti-acetyl-Lys-12 H4 antibody (06-761, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-acetyl-Lys-16 H4 antibody (07-329, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and protein A-Sepharose beads. DNA was released from the immunoprecipitates and purified. Recovered DNA was PCR-amplified with specific primers. PCR was carried out with or without [α-32P]dCTP, and the products were resolved by 6% PAGE and exposed to x-ray film or resolved on 1.8% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Pull Down Assay—The plasmids pJL205 (producing only GST moiety) and pREP1-KZ-atf1+ were transformed into HS1001 (Clr6-HA) and HS1005 (Clr3-HA) cells, and pJL205 and pREP-GST-Swi6 were introduced into HS801 (Atf1-HA) and HS821 (Pcr1-HA). Cells were cultured in selective medium with thiamine, and the protein expression was induced by thiamine depletion for 17 h. Protein extracts of cells overexpressing GST, GST-Swi6, and GST-Atf1 were prepared in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture) by using the glass bead method (31Alfa C. Fantes P. Hayams J. Mcleod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar, 32Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). GST, SGT-Swi6, and GST-Atf1 proteins were precipitated using glutathioneSepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After intensive washing with binding buffer, proteins bound to Sepharose beads were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Applied Science).RESULTSAtf1 and Pcr1 Proteins Are General Silencing Regulators at the Silent Mating-type Loci and Their Deficiencies Cause Silencing Defects via Changes in Histone Acetylation Patterns— Deletion of two putative ATF/CREB-binding motifs down-stream of the cenH repeat caused a partial derepression of the endogenous Mc gene from mat3-M locus (21Thon G. Bjerling K.P. Nielsen I.S. Genetics. 1999; 151: 945-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify factors important for the stochastic heterochromatin assembly in an RNAi-independent, Swi6-dependent manner, we investigated the roles of bZIP transcription factors in heterochromatin silencing at the mating-type region. To test whether Atf1 is involved in heterochromatin silencing at centromeres and telomeres, in addition to the silent mat locus, we investigated the effect of atf1 deletion on silencing of reporter genes inserted within each heterochromatic domain. An atf1 deletion strain carrying the ade6+ reporter gene inserted at the mat3-M locus displayed a loss of silencing of the reporter gene (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the atf1 deletion resulted in increased transcriptional repression at both centromeres and telomeres (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the absence of atf1 disrupted silencing of another reporter gene, ura4+, inserted at the silent mat3-M locus (data not shown). These data indicate that Atf1 is required for silencing RNA pol II-transcribed genes inserted into the silent mat3 region. In summary, this indicates that Atf1 acts as a positive regulator of mat3-M silencing but as a negative regulator of heterochromatin formation at other regions.Fig. 1The epigenetic inheritance and silencing of marker genes at mat3-M are defective in Δatf1 and Δpcr1 cells.A, deletion of atf1 decreases silencing at the mating-type locus (mat3::ade6+, top) but increases silencing at centromeres (otr1R::ade6+, middle) and telomeres (ade6+-tel, bottom). Serial dilutions of the indicated cultures were spotted onto selective (–Ade) and nonselective (N/S) plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. B, effect of Δatf1, Δpcr1, Δatf1Δpcr1, and Δswi6 deletions on mat3::ade6+ silencing. A physical map of the silent mat locus is shown (top). IR-L and IR-R indicate inverted repeats that form putative boundary elements. cenH, which shares homology with centromeric repeats, is part of the K region. Comparisons of colony growth (middle) and color (bottom) on adenine-free or low adenine medium are shown. Strains used are as follows: ade6+ (HS541); ade6– (JY746); WT (Hu51); Δatf1 (YKJ143); Δpcr1 (HS581); Δatf1Δpcr1 (HS701); and Δswi6 (HS251). C, deletion of atf1+ and pcr1+ causes transcriptional derepression of the ade6+ reporter gene inserted into the mat3-M locus. Total RNA was prepared from each strain and subjected to reverse transcription. Competitive PCR was used to compare the expression of a wild type ade6+ gene placed adjacent to mat3-M, and the corresponding mini-gene copy at the endogenous locus (ade6-DN/N). Strains used are as follows: WT (AP137); Δatf1 (YKJ135); Δpcr1 (HS631); Δatf1Δpcr1 (HS651); and Δswi6 (YKJ129). D, the absence of Atf1 and Pcr1 decreases the stability of epigenetic inheritance. For transition assays, each red colony from B was picked, diluted, and then transferred onto YE plates; half-sectored and total sectored colonies were counted after 3–4 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A previous report (25Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Pcr1 binds to the ATF/CREB-binding sequences in vitro and that the presence of Pcr1 was critical for nuclear localization of Atf1 (23Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether Pcr1, a binding partner of Atf1, is also required for mat3-M silencing. Similar to atf1 mutants, Δpcr1 showed reduced silencing, but the effect was weaker than that of Δatf1 or Δatf1Δpcr1 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that heterodimerization of Atf1 and Pcr1 is important for the mat3-M silencing but that to some extent Atf1 can compensate for silencing defects resulting from the absence of Pcr1.To assess whether the position effect on ade6+ was directly related to its transcriptional expression, we performed RT-PCR to measure levels of mRNA from wild-type ade6+ inserted within the mat3-M locus and the corresponding minigene ade6-DN/N at the endogenous locus on wild type (WT), atf1, pcr1, and swi6 deletion derivatives (Fig. 1C). The relative expression of the ade6+ marker can be determined by the ratio of the full-length ade6+ to the ade6-DN/N products in a competitive RT-PCR. The ratio in the Δatf1 and Δpcr1 mutants was considerably higher than that in the isogenic parental strain (WT) but much lower than that in a swi6 deletion mutant. Thus, our data demonstrate that transcriptional derepression of ade6+ at the inactive mat locus occurred via a disruption of silencing.We next performed a transition assay to determine the effect of the Δatf1 and Δpcr1 mutations on the epigenetic inheritance of the repressed state of ade6+ expression (Fig. 1D). In this system, ade6-off cells in the repressed state were distinguished by red coloration, whereas cells expressing ade6+, ade6-on cells were white. We found a striking increase in ade6-off to ade6-on conversion in Δatf1, Δpcr1, and Δatf1Δpcr1 mutants, to levels that were significantly higher than that of the wild-type background (Hu51 strain) (Fig. 1D). This indicates that Atf1 and Pcr1 are required for stable epigenetic inheritance of the heterochromatic state at the mat locus.To address whether Atf1 and Pcr1 are involved in silencing at another interval between mat1 and mat2, called the L region, we investigated the effect of Δatf1 or Δpcr1 null mutations on the silencing of ade6+ reporter genes integrated at the BglII and SacI sites of the L region. Despite the fact that the L region has no apparent ATF/CREB-binding motifs, the Δatf1 and Δpcr1 deletion strains had uniformly white colonies on low adenine medium and higher cell viability on adenine-free selective medium relative to the parental strains (AP136 and AP144), demonstrating full derepression of silencing at the L region (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, ChIP analysis showed that the absence of atf1 and pcr1 resulted in a considerable increase in histone H3/H4 acetylation and euchromatic-specific H3 Lys-4 methylation of the selected region (BglII-R) around the BglII site upstream of the mat2-P locus compared with that of wild type. The heterochromatin-specific H3 Lys-9 methylation was unlikely to be affected (Fig. 2B), perhaps because of the presence of other redundant nucleation mechanisms of heterochromatin assembly via the REII element (20Ayoub N. Goldshmidt I. Cohen A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 495-508PubMed Google Scholar) or cenH repeat (9Hall I.M. Shankaranarayana G.D. Noma K. Ayoub N. Cohen A. Grewal S.I. Science. 2002; 297: 2232-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 22Ayoub N. Goldshmidt I. Lyakhovetsky R. Cohen A. Genetics. 2000; 156: 983-994PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that the silencing defects observed in Δatf1 and Δpcr1 mutants were caused by the change in histone acetylation pattern and subsequent H3 methylation pattern. Furthermore, we found that atf1 and pcr1 deletions affect endogenous mat3-M expression in addition to altering the expression of the ade6+ and ura4+ reporter genes adjacent to the silent mat3-M locus (Fig. 2C). Thus, our results suggest that Atf1 and Pcr1 might act as general silencing factors of the inactive mat2/3 interval and nearby regions.Fig. 2Δatf1 and Δpcr1 deletions derepress mat2-P silencing and increase endogenous mat3-M gene expression.A, effects of Δatf1 and Δpcr1 deletions on mat2-P silencing.

Comparisons of colony growth ability (middle) and color (bottom) on selective (–Ade) or nonselective (N/S) or low adenine medium are shown.

Whereas Wnt signaling is clearly pro-oncogenic, TGF-β signaling is cell- and context-dependent, manifesting both inhibitory and proliferative effects. The growth factor, gastrin, has previously been shown to be a downstream target of the Wnt pathway and a promoter of gastrointestinal cancer. In this study, we show that the mouse gastrin promoter is regulated synergistically by TGF-β/Smads and β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF). Co-transfection of Smad3/Smad4 and β-catenin expression constructs synergistically activated mouse gastrin promoter activity 30–60-fold in AGS cells with minimal effect seen with either construct alone. This activation was further potentiated by TGF-β1 treatment. Mutating either the TCF binding site or the Smad-binding element (SBE) diminished the activation of gastrin expression by Smad3/Smad4 and β-catenin and led to a loss of gastrin promoter responsiveness to TGF-β1 treatment. Wnt and TGF-β regulated endogenous gastrin mRNA levels in AGS cells in a similar fashion, as revealed by small interference RNA studies or overexpression of Smads and TCF4/β-catenin. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that the putative SBE and T-cell factor (TCF) sites were able to bind a complex containing Smads and β-catenin/TCF4. In addition, the synergy between Smads and β-catenin/TCF4 was dependent on CREB-binding protein (CBP)/P300, as demonstrated by overexpression of CBP or E1A. Moreover, by using a heterogeneous promoter reporter system, we showed that this complex containing Smads/TCF4/β-catenin complex was able to up-regulate transcription at isolated SBE or TCF sites. Thus, the Wnt signaling pathway is able to activate some target genes through its actions as a co-activator at non-TCF sites and has the potential to profoundly alter transcriptional responses to TGF-β signaling. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and Wnt/wingless pathways play critical roles in the specification of cell fate during development and also contribute to cancer formation and progression.

The most common mutations occur in the APC tumor suppressor gene, which forms a complex with axin and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) 1The abbreviations used are: GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; TCF, T-cell factor; LEF, lymphoid-enhancing factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; DAPA, DNA affinity precipitation assay(s); siRNA, small interference RNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. to form a β-catenin degradation complex, which phosphorylates β-catenin, thus targeting the protein for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation (1Oving I.M. Clevers H.C. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 32: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In the absence of phosphorylation and degradation, β-catenin accumulates in cytoplasm and moves into the nucleus, where it functions as a cofactor for the T-cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factor family. Whereas it does not bind DNA itself, β-catenin is essential for the transcriptional activity of TCF/LEF, which binds to a consensus DNA sequence of 5′-CCTTTGTCT-3′ within promoters of target genes to activate transcription. Wnt signaling is important in embryonic development, maintenance of stem cell populations, and the progression of gastrointestinal and other cancers (2Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). A number of TCF/LEF target genes have been identified, some of which (including c-myc, cyclin D1, MMP7, EPHB2/3) have important implications in understanding the role of Wnt signaling in cancer, and many additional potential Wnt targets have been identified by large scale DNA microarrays (3Giles R.H. van Es J.H. Clevers H. Fodde R. Kuipers J. Rosenberg C. Smits R. Kielman M. Gaspar C. Breukel C. Wiegant J. Clevers H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1653: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). Gastrin is a gastrointestinal hormone and growth factor that has recently been shown to be a functionally relevant down-stream target of the Wnt signaling pathway (4Koh T.J. Bulitta C.J. Fleming J.V. Dockray G.J. Varro A. Wang T.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Incompletely processed gastrins (progastrin and glycine-extended gastrin) are capable of inducing colonic proliferation both in vitro and in vivo (5Koh T.J. Dockray G.J. Varro A. Cahill R.J.

Deletion of the gastrin gene results in a decrease in colonic proliferation, and overexpression of incompletely processed gastrins results in increased colonic proliferation, accelerated colonic neoplasia in response to azoxymethane or Apc/Min-dependent polyposis (10Dockray G.J. Varro A. Dimaline R. Wang T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 11Singh P. Velasco M. Given R. Varro A. Wang T.C.

Physiol. 2000; 278: G390-G399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incompletely processed gastrins are also up-regulated in colon carcinomas, and several studies have also found that the plasma level of progastrin is significantly elevated in colorectal cancer patients (13Siddheshwar R.K. Gray J.C. Kelly S.B. Gut. 2001; 48: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In initial studies, we demonstrated that induced Apc expression was capable of suppressing gastrin gene expression and that overexpression of activated β-catenin could stimulate the human gastrin promoter 2–3-fold through a putative TCF-binding site (4Koh T.J. Bulitta C.J. Fleming J.V. Dockray G.J. Varro A. Wang T.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which β-catenin promotes gene transcription are not well understood but are thought to involve interactions with other cofactors. One pathway that appears to be able to interact with the Wnt signaling pathway and that also plays an important role in cancer, is the TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β was originally named as a transforming growth factor based on its ability to induce malignant behavior by normal fibroblasts (14Assoian R.K. Frolik C.A. Roberts A.B. Miller D.M. Sporn M.B. Cell. 1984; 36: 35-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It was later recognized that TGF-β had profound growth-suppressive effects on epithelial and lymphoid cells and for a time was considered primarily as a tumor suppressor. However, it is now accepted that TGF-β signaling has a dual role in cancer; whereas TGF-β signaling may act as a tumor suppressor at early stages of carcinoma development, in later stages TGF-β signaling contributes to invasion, metastases, and progression of advanced disease (15Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar, 16Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas the loss of TGF-β responsiveness may provide a distinct advantage for developing tumors, only a minority of tumors have genetic alterations in this pathway. Instead, TGF-β expression is up-regulated during late stage cancer progression and in most tumors is associated with a loss of TGF-β growth inhibition through uncertain mechanisms. TGF-β signaling is clearly cell type- and context-dependent, and in cancer TGF-β responses appear to be realigned in favor of growth promotion (17Roberts A.B. Wakefield L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8621-8623Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Members of the TGF-β superfamily exert their effects through cell surface receptors that have been well studied (18Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). The signaling cascade is activated by the dimerization of type II and type I receptors upon the binding of ligands such as TGF-β. The type I receptor is subsequently phosphorylated and then phosphorylates the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads, Smad2, and Smad3) (18Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). These proteins in turn form a heteromeric complex with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate expression of target genes in close association with a variety of transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors (19Ten Dijke P. Goumans M.J. Itoh F. Itoh S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Smads typically activate gene transcription, but they are also involved in TGF-β-mediated repression of transcription. Furthermore, Smads function to regulate transcriptional responses in several distinct ways. They can bind to DNA at a consensus-binding site (GTCT) and directly regulate transcription by recruiting co-activators or co-repressors to the promoter. However, Smads appear to bind to DNA with rather low sequence specificity and affinity, and DNA binding alone by Smads is often insufficient to mediate sequence-specific transcriptional responses. Interactions with other DNA-binding partners are typically required for Smad-dependent transcriptional responses. Thus, Smads have been reported to interact with other sequence-specific DNA transcription factors, and in this context they may function as co-modulators of transcription (18Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar, 19Ten Dijke P. Goumans M.J. Itoh F. Itoh S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). One link that has received some attention is the interaction between Smads and the Wnt signaling pathway. Previous observations indicated cooperation between Wnt and TGF-β pathways in the transcription regulation of a number of target genes. Wnt cooperates with TGF-β during embryonic development and tissue maintenance, and both are required for the establishment of a dorsal signaling center, Spemann's organizer (20Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Activation of both Wnt and TGF-β signaling leads to translocation of DNA-binding proteins to the nucleus, and direct interactions between the downstream components has been demonstrated. Importantly, LEF1/TCF and β-catenin have been shown to form a specific complex with Smad3 or Smad4 (20Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 21Labbe E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48805-48814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Studies have reported that Smad3 and Smad4 can associate with β-catenin in the renal proximal tubule cell line, HK-2 (23Tian Y.C. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1619-1628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Xenopus, the interaction between LEF1/β-catenin and Smad3/Smad4 synergistically activates expression of the twin (Xtwn) gene during Spemann's organizer formation (20Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W. Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Labbe et al. (21Labbe E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) showed that this activation results from a physical interaction between Smad3 and the HMG box domain of LEF1. In this model promoter, Smad binding to DNA at an SBE site stabilized the transcriptional activation complex of β-catenin/LEF1 attached to an adjacent TCF site. Importantly, activation of TCF sites by TGF-β signaling was completely dependent on the presence of adjacent Smad-binding sites (21Labbe E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Letamendia A. Labbe E. Attisano L. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2001; 83: 31-39Google Scholar). However, the requirement for adjacent sites has been challenged by reports that ectopic expression of Smad3 and Smad4 could activate LEF/TCF-specific reporter genes and that ectopic LEF1 expression could weakly induce SBE-specific reporter activity (25Eger A. Stockinger A. Park J. Langkopf E. Mikula M. Gotzmann J. Mikulits W. Beug H. Foisner R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2672-2680Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Given the recognized role of gastrin as a growth factor for colon cancer and its reported regulation by the Wnt pathway, we explored the possible role of TGF-β signaling in the modulation of gastrin gene expression. Our results indicate that the murine gastrin gene is synergistically transactivated by TGF-β/Smads and Wnt/β-catenin at the transcription level. Furthermore, the results support the notion that Wnt signaling may function as a co-activator, transactivating genes through Smad-binding sites. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assays—AGS gastric adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2). On the day before transfection, 1 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well plates. 0.3 μg of reporter construct and 0.3 μg of each expression construct were transfected using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. 0.005 μgof the promoter TK-Renilla luciferase construct was transfected as internal control. The total DNA amount was kept at 1.5 μg/well. Corresponding empty vectors were used to make up the difference between treatments. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h later using a Monolight™ 3010 Luminometer (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The dual luciferase assay kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All experiments were done by triplicates and performed at least three independent times. All results were shown as relative luciferase activity and represented the mean ± S.E. For TGF-β treatment, cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then cultured for another 24 h after the addition of 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 (Sigma). Plasmids—The promoter luciferase reporter constructs of murine gastrin were generated by PCR (see Table I for primer sequences) and digested with SmaI and BamHI and then ligated into pXP2 (26Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar) predigested with the same enzymes. The mutation of putative LEF/TCF or Smad binding site was done by site-directed mutagenesis using a –140 construct as template and the following primers: 5′-TGG GGA TTC TGT CCT CAC CTG GAA and 5′-TTC CAG GTG AGG ACA GAA TCC CCA for SBE2 and 5′-TTC CAG GCC TAA TTC TCT TGC TGT GGG and CCC ACA GCA AGA GAA TTA GGC CTG GAA for TCF binding site (mutated nucleotides are underlined). Heterologous promoter reporter vectors were generated by cloning custom made oligonucleotides corresponding to either the TCF binding site or Smad binding element (SBE2) of murine gastrin promoter (refer to Table I for primer sequences) into BamHI/XhoI sites of enhancerless luciferase reporter vector pT81 (26Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar).

Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—AGS cells were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged Smad3 or Smad4 or both along with β-catenin and TCF4 expression constructs. Cells were harvested 48 h later and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). 2000 μg of proteins from each preparation was incubated with 0.5 μg of appropriate immunoprecipitation antibody in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Incubation was continued overnight after the addition of 30 μl of protein-A Sepharose flurry (Amersham Biosciences). Protein A-precipitated protein complexes were recovered by brief centrifugation and washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer and then disassociated by adding 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The proteins were detected by Western blot using the indicated antibodies. Anti-β-catenin and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-Smad2/3 and anti-TCF4 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Preparation of Nuclear Extract and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts from TGF-β1 or vehicle-treated AGS cells were prepared as previously described (32Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene. Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 33Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). For EMSA, 32P-labeled double-stranded DNA oligomers corresponding to the murine gastrin SBE2 (5′-TGG GGA GTC TGG CCT CAC CTG GAA) and the TCF binding site (5′-TTC CAG GCC CAT TTC TCT TGC TGT GGG) were incubated with 6 μg of nuclear extracts on ice for 20 min. For competition assays, 100× cold wild type or mutant oligonucleotides (mutant SBE2: 5′-TGG GGA tTC TGt CCT CAC CTG GAA; mutant TCF site: 5′-TTC CAG GCC taa TTC TCT TGC TGT GGG, with mutated nucleotides in lowercase) were mixed with 32P-labeled probes and then incubated with nuclear extracts from TGF-β1-treated AGS cells. For supershift assays, the antibody against Smad3, Smad4, β-catenin, or TCF4 or control antibody against cyclin D1 was added to the mixture individually and incubated on ice for 30 min before resolving in 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assays (DAPA)—DNA Affinity Precipitation Assays were performed essentially as previously described (34Singh J. Murata K. Itahana Y. Desprez P.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1812-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33431-33438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5′-biotin end-labeled sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the wild type or mutant Smad- or TCF/LEF-binding site (see above) of murine gastrin promoter were custom synthesized by Invitrogen. The oligomers were annealed and purified as previously described (35Zhang Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33431-33438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 50 μg of nuclear extracts from TGF-β1-treated AGS cells were incubated with 0.25 μg of wild type or mutant oligonucleotide probe in 400 μl of binding buffer (60 mm KCl, 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) on ice for 1 h. The DNA-protein complexes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation with 40 μl of Tetralink™ Avidin Resin (Promega, Madison, WI), which was washed and then pre-equilibrated with binding buffer for 1 h. Avidin-precipitated DNA-protein complexes were washed five times with binding buffer and then disassociated by adding 40 μlof2× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The proteins were resolved on polyacrylamide gel and followed by immunoblotting using specified antibodies. Small Interference RNA (siRNA) and Real Time PCR—Double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides for RNA interference of control (enhanced green fluorescence protein), Smad3, and TCF4 were custom-synthesized by Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and transfected into AGS cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was extracted from transfected cells by the Trizol method, and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript first-strand reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Invitrogen). mRNA levels of gastrin and the RNAi targeting genes were quantified by real time PCR using the SYBR Green kit (Qiagen) and the ΔΔ™ method. The oligonucleotide sequences for real time PCR are as follows: human gastrin, 5′-GCG CTG GCC GCC TTC TCT GA (sense) and 5′-CAT CCA TAG GCT TCT TCT TCT TCC (antisense); GAPDH, 5′-GAC ATC AAG AAG GTG GTG AAG C (sense) and 5′-GTC CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT GTA G (antisense); Smad3, 5′-GGC CAC CGT CTG CAA CAT C (sense) and 5′-TAC TGG TCA CAG TCT GTC (antisense); TCF4, 5′-TGA AGG CAG CTG CCT CAG C (sense) and 5′-GTG GGT GGC CTC AGC GAG C (antisense). The Murine Gastrin Promoter Is Synergistically Activated by Overexpression of Smad3/Smad4 and β-Catenin—Previous studies by our group (4Koh T.J. Bulitta C.J. Fleming J.V. Dockray G.J. Varro A. Wang T.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) as well as others (36Watson S.A. Smith A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 625-631PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that gastrin is a downstream target of the Wnt signaling pathway. However, TGF-β is also up-regulated during colon cancer progression and has been shown to synergize with the Wnt pathway (20Nishita M. Hashimoto M.K. Ogata S. Laurent M.N. Ueno N. Shibuya H. Cho K.W.

Recent reports suggest that there are important differences between genes that are activated by Wnt signaling alone and those that are activated by both TGF-β and Wnt pathway (37Nelson W.J. Nusse R. Science. 2004; 303: 1483-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). In order to understand the regulation of gastrin transcription by oncogenic pathways, we examined the role of these pathways in regulation of the murine gastrin promoter. A 1-kb fragment of murine gastrin promoter containing 50 base pairs downstream of the transcription initiation site was joined to the luciferase reporter gene (pmGAS1kb) and used in transient transfection reporter assays. The reporter construct was transfected into AGS cells alone or co-transfected in different combinations with overexpression constructs for Smad3, Smad4, and constitutively active β-catenin at a ratio of 1:1. Whereas co-transfection of β-catenin alone had minimal effects on the murine gastrin promoter, and Smad3/Smad4 resulted in a modest 3–5-fold promoter activation, the combination of all three (β-catenin/Smad3/Smad4) resulted in a 30–60-fold activation of the murine gastrin promoter (or >10-fold synergy) (Fig. 1A). The transfected cells were also treated with 3 ng/ml TGF-β1 or left untreated to evaluate the responsiveness of murine gastrin to TGF-β. TGF-β treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2-fold stimulation of the 1-kb murine gastrin promoter, and the activation was potentiated 4-fold by cotransfection of Smad3/Smad4 but unaffected by co-transfection of β-catenin (Fig. 1B). Overall, these initial studies suggested a strong synergistic interaction between TGF-β/Smad and Wnt pathways at the murine gastrin promoter. Regulation of Gastrin Gene Expression in Vivo by TGF-β/Smads and Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling—In order to further validate our results with reporter genes, we examined the effects of TGF-β and Wnt signaling on endogenous gastrin gene expression in AGS cells. We employed two separate approaches. First, we evaluated endogenous gastrin mRNA level after transient transfection of overexpression constructs for Smad3/Smad4 and TCF4/β-catenin in various combinations. Quantitative real time PCR showed that each of the combinations increased gastrin mRNA level relative to the GAPDH control, with the greatest increase observed with transfection of all four constructs (3-fold without and 5-fold with TGF-β1 treatment) (Fig. 2A). Simultaneous TGF-β stimulation resulted in a significant increase in gastrin mRNA level (Fig. 2A). Second, we introduced gene-specific double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides by transient transfection into AGS cells in order to knock down the endogenous level of gene e"
https://openalex.org/W2000854765,"There is now clear evidence that the Complement anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a receptors (C3aR and C5aR) are expressed in glial cells, notably in astrocytes and microglia. In contrast, very few data are available concerning the possible expression of these receptors in neurons. Here, we show that transient expression of C3aR and C5aR occurs in cerebellar granule neurons in vivo with a maximal density in 12-day-old rat, suggesting a role of these receptors during development of the cerebellum. Expression of C3aR and C5aR mRNAs and proteins was also observed in vitro in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Quantification of the mRNAs by real-time reverse transcription-PCR showed a peak of expression at day 2 in vitro (DIV 2); the C3aR and C5aR proteins were detected by Western blot analysis at DIV 4 and by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry in differentiating neurons with a maximum density at DIV 4–9. Apoptosis of granule cells plays a crucial role for the harmonious development of the cerebellar cortex. We found that, in cultured granule neurons in which apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation and low potassium concentration, a C5aR agonist promoted cell survival and inhibited caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. The neuroprotective effect of the C5aR agonist was associated with a marked inhibition of caspase-9 activity and partial restoration of mitochondrial integrity. Our results provide the first evidence that C3aR and C5aR are both expressed in cerebellar granule cells during development and that C5a, but not C3a, is a potent inhibitor of apoptotic cell death in cultured granule neurons."

However, not much is known about calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation and its role in signal transduction in plants. By using a protein-protein interaction-based approach, we have isolated a novel plant-specific calmodulin-binding receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (CRCK1) from Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as its ortholog from Medicago sativa (alfalfa). CRCK1 does not show high homology to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in animals. In contrast, it shows high homology in the kinase domain to serine/threonine receptor-like kinases in plants. However, it contains neither a transmembrane domain nor an extracellular domain. Calmodulin binds to CRCK1 in a calcium-dependent manner with an affinity of ∼20.5 nm. The calmodulin-binding site in CRCK1 is located in amino acids 160–183, which overlap subdomain II of the kinase domain. CRCK1 undergoes autophosphorylation in the presence of Mg2+ at the threonine residue(s). The Km and Vmax values of CRCK1 for ATP are 1 μm and 33.6 pmol/mg/min, respectively. Calcium/calmodulin stimulates the kinase activity of CRCK1, which increases the Vmax of CRCK1 ∼9-fold. The expression of CRCK1 is increased in response to stresses such as cold and salt and stress molecules such as abscisic acid and hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate the presence of a calcium/calmodulin-regulated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase in plants. Furthermore, these results also suggest that calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphorylation involving CRCK1 plays a role in stress signal transduction in plants.

Furthermore, these results also suggest that calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphorylation involving CRCK1 plays a role in stress signal transduction in plants. Phosphorylation by protein kinase is one of the most common and important regulatory mechanisms in signal transduction in all organisms (1Hardie D.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 97-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Since the first plant protein kinase sequences were reported in 1989, more than 1,000 have been reported in GenBank™. In particular, plants have a large number of receptor-like serine/threonine kinases (RLK) 1The abbreviations used are: RLK, receptor-like kinase; RLCK, receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase; CaM, calmodulin; CCaMK, chimeric calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase; CRCK, calmodulin-regulated receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase; ABA, abscisic acid; T-DNA, transfer DNA. that resemble animal growth factor receptors, which can sense external signals and relay these signals by protein phosphorylation in plants (2Shiu S.H.

It is estimated that there are at least 600 RLK homologs, representing nearly 2.5% of the annotated protein-coding genes in Arabidopsis. Among them, 75% of the RLK family has a receptor configuration, with an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a kinase domain. These RLKs function in a wide range of signal response, such as BRI 1 for hormone perception (5Li J. Chory J.

Approximately 25% of the RLK family are cytoplasmic RLKs, containing only a kinase domain, and are thus named receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs). During the last decade, a few plant RLCKs, such as Pto and PBS1, have been characterized. In tomato, Pto confers resistance to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae strains expressing avrPto (10Tang X. Frederick R.D. Zhou J. Halterman D.A. Jia Y. Martin G.B. Science. 1996; 274: 2060-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and in Arabidopsis, PBS1 is required for specific resistance to P. syringae strains expressing avrPphB (11Swiderski M.R. Innes R.W. Plant J. 2001; 26: 101-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the function of most plant RLCKs is not well understood. Calcium is a universal second messenger and acts as a mediator of stimulus-response coupling in the regulation of plant growth, development, and responses to environmental stimuli (12Poovaiah B.W.

Various stimuli, such as cold, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and hydrogen peroxide, trigger changes in the cytosolic calcium concentration (17Knight H. Int. Rev.

Calmodulin (CaM), a small acidic protein with four EF-hand motifs, is one of the best characterized calcium receptors in eukaryotes. Upon calcium binding to the EF hands, CaM undergoes conformational changes, and the active Ca2+-CaM complex regulates the activity of downstream target proteins (13Reddy A.S. Plant Sci. 2001; 160: 381-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 16Yang T. Poovaiah B.W.

Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaM kinases) are the best characterized CaM-binding proteins in mammals and are major players in Ca2+/CaM-mediated signal transduction (23Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In plants, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation was observed 2 decades ago (24Veluthambi K. Poovaiah B.W. Science. 1984; 223: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, only two CaM-regulated kinases, which show overall homology to mammalian CaM kinases, have been reported to date, although there are a few other reported CaM-binding protein kinases (25Zhang L. Lu Y. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 123-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has reported that a chimeric Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) exhibits Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation and Ca2+/CaM-dependent substrate phosphorylation (26Takezawa D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4797-4801Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). CCaMK is required for bacterial and fungal symbioses in plants (28Levy J. Bres C. Geurts R. Chalhoub B. Kulikova O. Duc G. Journet E.P. Ane J.M. Lauber E. Bisseling T. Denarie J. Rosenberg C. Debelle F. Science. 2004; 303: 1361-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Recently, the activity of tobacco NtCBK2 was shown to be stimulated by CaM (29Hua W. Liang S. Lu Y.T. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel plant-specific calcium/CaM-regulated kinase, CRCK1, from Arabidopsis thaliana. In the kinase domain, this kinase has higher homology to receptor-like kinases than to mammalian CaM kinases. Ca2+/CaM interacts with subdomain II inside the kinase domain and up-regulates the kinase activity. Furthermore, the expression of CRCK1 in plants is stimulated by cold, salt, ABA, and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Cloning of CRCKs—The cold-treated A. thaliana ecotype Columbia and Medicago sativa cv. Radius seedling cDNA expression libraries (λScreen, Novagen) were screened by using 35S-labeled potato CaM (PCM6) as described (30Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The positive cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands. DNA sequences and amino acid sequences were analyzed by using GCG version 10.0 software, NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), TAIR (www.arabidopsis.org), and EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro). The full length of alfalfa CRCK cDNA and a partial Arabidopsis CRCK1 cDNA (amino acids 321–1407) were obtained from the cDNA library screening. The full length of CRCK1 was then cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR by using gene-specific primers (ATGAGGAGCAAAACCCCAAC/CTCAATGCTATTCTCGTTATCT) based on the data base and the nucleotide sequences of the partial cDNA. Construction of DNA Templates Coding CRCK Proteins—The templates for full-length coding regions of CRCKs were produced by PCR amplification from the cDNA library with gene-specific oligonucleotides containing the appropriate restriction sites for cloning into the down-stream of His6 tag into the pET-32a/b/c expression vector (Novagen). The nucleotide sequences of the cloned fragments derived by PCR amplification were determined after cloning into the pET-32 vector. The constructs were then transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. The bacteria were cultured in LB liquid medium at 30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm. CaM Binding Assay—The recombinant proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and incubated with 35S-labeled recombinant CaM (PCM6) plus 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mm MgCl2, respectively, in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl. The membranes were washed with the same buffer without 35S-labeled CaM and were exposed to x-ray film overnight. CaM Binding Affinity Assay—The recombinant CRCK1 was purified to homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column following the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen). The purified protein (4 pmol) was spotted on an Immobilon membrane (Millipore) and incubated with different amounts of 35S-labeled CaM with 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA overnight. After washing in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm CaCl2, radioactivities of bound CaM on each filter and free CaM in the incubation buffer collected before washing were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. In order to eliminate the nonspecific CaM binding, the bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control. The average background count was subtracted from the counts of protein samples when calculating the specific binding. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated based on Scatchard plot (30Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Assay—The synthetic peptide was prepared by using Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 431A in the Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Biotechnology, Washington State University. Samples containing 240 pmol (4 μg) of bovine CaM (Sigma) or potato PCM6 and different amounts of purified synthetic peptide in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and either 0.1 m CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA in a total volume of 30 μl were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE as described (30Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Plant Materials and Treatments—A. thaliana ecotype Columbia were grown in a 1:1 mixture of soil mix and vermiculite or 1× MS medium under a 14-h photoperiod/10-h dark at 20–22 °C in a green-house. Plant stress treatments were performed as described (31Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45049-45058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In brief, for cold stress plants were incubated at 4 °C; for salt stress, 200 mm NaCl was applied to the soil; for ABA and H2O2 treatments, plants were sprayed with 100 μm ABA or 10 mm H2O2, in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) with 1% Triton X-100, and the control plants were sprayed with the buffer alone. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All the treatments were performed at 22 °C except cold treatment. After each treatment, whole plants were collected and either immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA extraction or used for protein extraction. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissue essentially as described (30Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RNA samples (15 μg) were separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After transfer to Hybond N+ filters, the blots were hybridized using 32P-labeled DNAs and washed as described earlier (30Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38467-38473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Antibody Preparation—The peptide corresponding to the C-terminal amino acids 452–466 of CRCK1, which does not show high homology to other proteins in Arabidopsis, was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Two rabbits were injected intradermally by GenMed (San Francisco). The amount for initial injection and each of three booster injections was 250–300 μg. Blood samples were taken from rabbits before injection (preimmune serum) and at 90 days and 110 days after initial injection. The anti-CaMRLK1 antibody was purified as described (32Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 11.26-11.27Google Scholar). The serum was precipitated by 33% (v/v) ammonium sulfate in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and dialyzed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Protein Isolation and Western Analysis—Total proteins were prepared by homogenizing plant tissues on ice with extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm potassium acetate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.4 m sucrose) with a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). The soluble and membrane proteins were fractionated from 10 g of 3-week-old plants as described (33Zheng H. Bednarek S.Y. Sanderfoot A.A. Alonso J. Ecker J.R. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Smith J.A. Krauss M.R. Borkird C. Sung Z.R. Planta. 1988; 174: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h. The total membrane pellet was homogenized in 3 ml of Tris-buffered saline (0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0), solubilized by the addition of Triton X-100 (1% (v/v) final concentration), and cleared of insoluble material by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The protein content was determined by the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). The proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western blotting was performed according to the procedure suggested by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) using the anti-CRCK1 antibody. The preimmune serum was used as a control. Isolation of Knockout Plants—The seeds of Salk_063349 with a possible T-DNA insertion in exon 5 of At5g58940 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Fig. 1A). The CRCK1 insertion mutants were identified by PCR using two gene-specific primers, TCTGGTGATGTATGCCGACCA/TCTGCCATTTCAAGGCGGTTA, and a T-DNA left border primer as suggested (35Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E. Meyers C.C. Parker H. Prednis L. Ansari Y. Choy N.

Berry C.C. Ecker J.R. Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4153) Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was sequenced, and the T-DNA insertion site was determined. The mutant plants were further verified by Northern analysis by using full-length CRCK1 cDNA as a probe. Furthermore, Western analysis was performed by using the anti-CRCK1 antibody. CRCK1 was not detected in homozygous mutants but appeared in heterozygous mutants. Protein Autophosphorylation and Substrate Phosphorylation Assays—The kinase assay was performed as described (36Schulze-Muth P. Irmler S. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with modification. The autophosphorylation assay was carried out by using an incubation mixture that contained 500 nm CRCK1, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). The substrate phosphorylation assay was performed by using 250 nm CRCK1, 2 μg of histone IIIS (Sigma), and 10 μm ATP containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 20 min and terminated using 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For the ATP dependence assay, 500 nm of fusion protein was incubated with 0.1–10 μm of ATP containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the incorporation was measured by P81 filter binding method (37Sathyanarayanan P.V. Siems W.F. Jones J.P. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32940-32947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Lineweaver-Burk plot was generated by using Hyper version 1.1w hyperbolic regression program (homepage.ntlworld.com/john.easterby/software.html). Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described (26Takezawa D. Ramachandiran S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the autophosphorylated CRCK1 was excised from the gel and was hydrolyzed by 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 2 h and subjected to paper chromatography using propionic acid, 1 m NH4OH, and isopropyl alcohol (45:17.5:17.5) as a solvent. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (5 mg/ml) were used as standards. Immunoprecipitation of the CRCK1 Complex—CRCK1 was immunoprecipitated from total plant protein extracts as described (38Lechner E. Xie D. Grava S. Pigaglio E. Planchais S. Murray J.A. Parmentier Y. Mutterer J. Dubreucq B. Shen W.H. Genschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50069-50080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, 10-day-old plants were homogenized in an extraction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA or 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture, which was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g. The supernatants were collected and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and either 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm CaCl2. One mg of total protein per ml was then incubated with 40 μl of the anti-CRCK1 antibody or preimmune serum overnight on ice with gentle shaking. 300 μg of protein A beads (Sigma) were then added, and the samples were shaken for an additional 6 h at 4 °C and washed five times with the dialysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated complex was subjected to autophosphorylation in the reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE buffer. The proteins were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, the beads were suspended in SDS-PAGE buffer, and the samples were subjected to Western analysis against an anti-CaM antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Isolation of CRCK1—The cold-treated A. thaliana and Medicago sativa cDNA libraries were screened with 35S-labeled CaM. Over 400 positive clones were obtained from 1.5 × 106 recombinant phages. These include known CaM-binding proteins, such as glutamate decarboxylase (39Baum G. Chen Y. Arazi T. Takatsuji H. Fromm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19610-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kinesin (40Wang W. Takezawa D. Narasimhulu S.B. Reddy A.S. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Reddy A.S. Safadi F. Narasimhulu S.B. Golovkin M. Hu X. J. Biol.

One positive clone from each library was identified, which encodes for a polypeptide with high homology to plant RLCK, and were therefore named Arabidopsis CRCK1 and alfalfa CRCK. The nucleotide sequences of Arabidopsis CRCK1 in the coding region are the same as At5g58940 of the data base between 1–244 and 410-end, but are different between 245 and 409. A comparison of the cDNA and genomic sequences in the data base revealed that this is a result of an incorrect prediction of the 2nd intron site in the data base (Fig. 1A). Another possibility is that At5g58940 has two transcripts by alternative splicing, but no other transcripts were identified by using reverse transcriptase-PCR-based cloning, suggesting that the data base prediction is not correct. Arabidopsis CRCK1 encodes for a peptide with 468 amino acids, has a molecular mass of ∼52.65 kDa, and a pI of 10.37, whereas alfalfa CRCK encodes for a peptide with 456 amino acids, has a molecular mass of 51.38 kDa, and a pI of 10.19. These two CRCKs exhibit 64.4% similarity and 54.3% identity for their deduced amino acid sequences, suggesting that they are orthologs (Fig. 1B). They have conserved kinase domains with all 11 subdomains of the serine/threonine kinase. BLAST comparison indicates that CRCKs have higher homology to plant RLKs including Pto, PBS1, BRI 1, and CLV1 than other CaM kinases from plants and animals, suggesting CRCKs are plant-specific RLKs (43Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). For example, the overall homology (identity) is 51.05% (41.26%) with Pto and 52.84% (41.14%) with PBS1. However, there is less than 40% homology (26% identity) with rat CaMKIIα, lily CcaMK, and a soybean CDPK. CDPKs are a family of plant protein kinases containing a CaM domain directly fused to the kinase domain (44Cheng S.H. Willmann M.R. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 469-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). It is notable that At4g00330 and At2g11520 in the Arabidopsis genome show high overall homology to CRCK1 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that they are CRCK1 homologs and are thus named CRCK2 and CRCK3. Other than the conserved kinase domain in the central portion, other portions of CRCK1 have no significant homology to any known functional domains in the data base. In addition, CRCKs have no extracellular domain or transmembrane domain based on the protein structure prediction programs, suggesting that CRCKs are cytoplasmic RLKs (43Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). CRCKs Are Calcium-dependent CaM-binding Proteins—To verify further that CRCKs are CaM-binding proteins, total proteins from an E. coli strain containing the full length of Arabidopsis CRCK1 and the alfalfa homolog were subjected to 35S-labeled CaM binding assays. CaM binds to the recombinant CRCK1 (Fig. 2A) and alfalfa CRCK (data not shown) in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2. However, in the presence of 2 mm EGTA, a calcium chelator (Fig. 2A), or 1 mm MgCl2 (data not shown), the CaM binding was not observed, suggesting that the CaM-binding properties of CRCKs are Ca2+-dependent. Western blot analysis using the anti-CRCK1 antibody was performed to confirm the identity of CRCK1 (Fig. 2A). The CaM binding affinity of CRCK1 was measured by blotting CRCK1 on a filter and incubating with varying concentrations of 35S-labeled CaM in the presence of 0.1 mm CaCl2. The labeled CaM binds to CRCK1 with a saturation at ∼130 nm (Fig. 2B), indicating the presence of a saturable high affinity binding site in CRCK1. Based on the Scatchard plot analysis of the saturation curve, the dissociation constant (Kd) of CaM for CRCK1 was estimated to be about 20.5 nm. The binding of CaM to CRCK1 was completely blocked in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. The Scatchard analysis also indicated that the C-terminal portion of CRCK1 has a single CaM-binding site. The CaM-binding Site of CRCK1 Is Located Inside the Catalytic Domain—Most characterized CaM-binding proteins have a secondary structural feature, a basic amphiphilic α-helix, even though the amino acid residues in the CaM-binding region of these proteins are not conserved (45Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 46O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). A helical wheel projection of the peptide sequences predicted that the amino acids 160–183 around subdomain II of the CRCK1 kinase domain contain the CaM-binding structural feature. The amino acid residues 160–183 form an α-helix with a hydrophobic face and a basic hydrophilic face. In particular, a hydrophobic residue, here Ile172, embedded in a context of basic residues Lys173 and Arg174, is a common feature in known CaM targets (46O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 47Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A peptide with 24 residues corresponding to the putative CaM-binding region (amino acids 160–183) was incubated with bovine CaM or PCM6. The 24-mer peptide is capable of forming a stable complex with either bovine CaM or plant CaM (PCM6) in the presence of Ca2+ but not in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2C). Without adding the peptide, a single free CaM band was observed. After the peptide was added, another band representing the peptide-CaM complex appeared. When the ratio of peptide to CaM was equal, the free CaM band disappeared and the intensity of the peptide-CaM complex increased. No free CaM was detected as a molar ratio of peptide/CaM is 1.5. These observations indicate that the CaM-binding site is located onto amino acids 160–183 in CRCK1. Most interestingly, the CaM-binding site is located around subdomain II of the kinase domain, which contains a conserved lysine residue (Lys173) for ATP binding (48Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M.

Using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a chicken 155-kDa cytoplasmic antigen (p155) localizing at the apical junctional complex, we have cloned a cDNA of its mouse homologue. The full-length cDNA of mouse p155 encoded a 148-kDa polypeptide containing a coiled-coil domain with sequence similarity to cingulin, a tight junction (TJ)-associated plaque protein. We designated this protein JACOP (junction-associated coiled-coil protein). Immunofluorescence staining showed that JACOP was concentrated in the junctional complex in various types of epithelial and endothelial cells. Furthermore, in the liver and kidney, JACOP was also distributed along non-junctional actin filaments. Upon immunoelectron microscopy, JACOP was found to be localized to the undercoat of TJs in the liver, but in some tissues, its distribution was not restricted to TJs but extended to the area of adherens junctions. Overexpression studies have revealed that JACOP was recruited to the junctional complex in epithelial cells and to cell-cell contacts and stress fibers in fibroblasts. These findings suggest that JACOP is involved in anchoring the apical junctional complex, especially TJs, to actin-based cytoskeletons.

TJs create the circumferential seal around cells and work as barriers against the free diffusion of solutes through the paracellular pathway (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J.

The strength and selectivity of the TJ barrier vary among cell types depending on their physiological requirement of paracellular transport (2Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J.

Furthermore, the biogenesis and barrier function of TJs are influenced by various intracellular signaling systems (4Anderson J.M. van Itallie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent progresses in the identification and characterization of TJ-constituting proteins have enabled the analysis of the molecular basis of the structure and the functional regulation of the TJ barrier. TJ strands, the intramembrane part of TJs observed by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, mainly consist of at least two types of integral membrane proteins, claudins and occludin, both of which have four membrane-spanning regions (6Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 7Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). JAMs (junctional adhesion molecules), members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, are also included in or localized very close to TJ strands (8Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L.

Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, claudins, which comprise a multi-gene family containing >20 members, have been shown to contribute directly to the structure and barrier function of TJs (5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Similar to other intercellular junctions, TJs also contain various cytoplasmic plaque proteins that are thought to play important roles in the formation and regulation of the TJ barrier by providing a scaffold for various proteins and linking adhesion molecules to cytoskeletons (4Anderson J.M. van Itallie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Among TJ-associated plaque proteins, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 have been well characterized, belonging to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family (10Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 11Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each of these membrane-associated guanylate kinases has multiple domains for protein-protein interaction including three PDZ domains, one SH3 domain, one guanylate kinase-like domain, and one proline-rich region, and works as a scaffold for various molecular components of TJs (13Stevenson B.R. Keon B.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), and they are localized immediately beneath the plasma membranes of TJs (10Stevenson B.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5981-5986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that these membrane-associated guanylate kinases establish the molecular link between the TJ membrane and the actin cytoskeleton. Non-membrane-associated guanylate kinase TJ-associated plaque proteins such as cingulin, symplekin, and 7H6 antigen have also been identified and characterized (22Citi S. Sabanay H. Kendrick-Jones J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Cingulin, which consists of a globular “head” domain, a coiled-coil “rod” domain, and a globular “tail” domain, is predicted to form a homoparallel dimer in the rod domains and is localized farther from the plasma membrane than ZO-1 (16Stevenson B.R. Heintzelman M.B. Anderson J.M. Citi S. Mooseker M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C621-C628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cordenonsi M. D'Arti F. Hammar E. Parry D.A.D. Kendrick-Jones J. Shore D. Citi S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cingulin forms a complex with ZO-1 and ZO-2 in vivo in its head domain, and overexpression of cingulin in cultured epithelial cells affected the normal distribution of ZO-1 at cell-cell contact sites, suggesting an intimate relationship between cingulin and ZO-1 in the TJ structure (25Cordenonsi M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27757-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vitro binding studies have revealed that cingulin interacts with various components of TJs including JAM, ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, myosin, and F-actin, suggesting a role for cingulin as a linker between the TJ membrane and F-actin (25Cordenonsi M.

The existence of these molecular linkage systems between the TJ membrane and actin filaments is consistent with the notion that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the regulation of the TJ barrier (4Anderson J.M. van Itallie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an increasing number of proteins have been found as cytoplasmic components of TJs including the Par-3·Par-6·aPKC complex, MAGI-1 and MAGI-3, Pilt, JEAP, MUPP-1, ZONAB, and GEF-H1/Lfc (29Izumi Y.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), suggesting that TJs are involved in various cellular functions other than the barrier function such as cell polarization, protein transport, cell growth regulation, and so forth. Along this line, we continued to identify novel TJ constituents by raising mAbs against a junction-enriched fraction isolated from the liver (37Hirase T. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 174-181PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the cDNA cloning and characterization of JACOP, a novel cytoplasmic plaque protein localizing at the apical junctional complex including TJs and AJs. This novel molecule showed significant sequence similarity to cingulin. Cloning of Mouse JACOP cDNA and Mouse Cingulin cDNA—A TJ- and AJ-enriched plasma membrane fraction was isolated from chick liver as described previously (37Hirase T. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 174-181PubMed Google Scholar). Peripheral membrane proteins were extracted from this membrane fraction with 1.5 m sodium trichloroacetate for 2 h at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4. This was followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Chicken p155/JACOP protein was precipitated from the supernatant with protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) with which E14 mAb was covalently coupled by the use of dimethyl pimerimide (Pierce). The precipitated proteins were eluted from the beads with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the protein band of p155/JACOP on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was excised and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis by the in-gel digestion method described by Rosenfeld et al. (38Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) in which four distinct peptide sequences (Peptides 1–4 in Fig. 1B) were determined. A homology search using the GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ data base identified a mouse EST clone (GenBank™ accession number AA144597) encoding a polypeptide, showing significant identity with Peptide 4 (Fig. 1B). Using two primers, 5′-TACTATGGCTGGAGTGT-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGCTGCTCATTCA-3′ designed from the sequence information in this mouse EST, a 348-base DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from mouse lung cDNA prepared from mouse lung total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). This fragment was used as a template to generate a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled hybridization probe with the DIG High Prime labeling kit (Roche Applied Science), and hybridization screening was performed using a Lambda ZAP mouse lung cDNA library (Clontech). Among the positive clones, cl.9Z of 2.9 kb was the longest and included the termination codon but the 5′ part of the cDNA containing the initiation codon was not found in this cDNA library. Using a hybridization probe designed from the 5′ sequence of cl.9Z, a Lambda ZAP F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cDNA library was screened and we successfully obtained a cDNA clone (cl.1–3), which contained the initiation codon and overlapped with cl.9Z. Based on the sequence information of these cDNA clones, DNA fragments that cover the full-length protein were obtained from F9 cDNA by PCR with appropriate primers and were ligated in pBluescript SK(-) to form the full-length JACOP cDNA using standard methods of molecular biology. Mouse cingulin cDNA was obtained by PCR based on the sequence information from a mouse EST (GenBank™ accession number BC042459). Using the primer pairs 5′-GAATCCGGGAGCACTGATCTGGAC-3′/5′-AGTCTGAATTGGATCACTTGTAGG-3′ and 5′-AGCATAGCCAGAGTCCCGATTCTG-3′/5′-AGACATCTTCTGCCTCTCAGCCTC-3′, two overlapping DNA fragments whose combination covers the whole open reading frame were amplified by PCR from cDNA prepared from mouse small intestine total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Nucleotide sequences of these two fragments (1.7 and 2.4 kb, respectively) were checked not to contain mutations responsible for the amino acid replacement. They were then linked together through the SphI site in pBluescript SK(-) to generate cDNA encoding the full-length mouse cingulin. Compared with BC042459, the cloned cingulin cDNAs lacked 24 nucleotides encoding MVSPAST (aa 338–345 in BC042459), probably because of alternative splicing. Generation of Expression Constructs—Using PCR and standard methods of molecular biology, an HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) with a three-glycine linker was bound to the N or C terminus of full-length JACOP. The C-terminal deletion constructs encoding aa 1–367 and 1–581 of JACOP with the N-terminal HA tag (j1–367 and j1–581, respectively) were produced by PCR using the N-terminal HA-tagged full-length JACOP construct as a template. An N-terminal deletion construct encoding aa 582–1298 of JACOP with a C-terminal HA tag (j582–1298) was produced by PCR using the C-terminal HA-tagged full-length JACOP construct as a template. DNA fragments for HA-tagged full-length JACOP and deletion constructs were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCAGGSneodelEcoRI (39Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—Total RNAs of various mouse tissues were prepared with TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen) based on the manufacturer's instructions, separated by 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto the nylon membrane. A ∼800-bp DIG-labeled DNA probe was generated with the DIG-PCR amplification kit (Roche Applied Science) using two primers, 5′-TTTGGCGAATACCAACACGTA-3′ and 5′-TTTCTTGGTTTCAGAATAGGC-3′, and full-length cDNA of JACOP as a template. Northern hybridization was performed in buffer containing 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% N-lauroyl sarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 2% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science) at 68 °C for 12 h. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 45 min and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche Applied Science). For the detection of hybridized probe, the membrane was soaked in CSPD chemiluminescence substrate (Roche Applied Science) and exposed to x-ray film, which was processed for imaging. As a loading control, the membrane was used for re-hybridization with a DIG-labeled probe of mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Antibodies—Bacterial expression constructs of the GST fusion protein containing aa 493–633 of JACOP and the maltose-binding protein fusion protein containing the identical region of JACOP were generated by subcloning the corresponding DNA fragment amplified by PCR into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pMAL-c2 (New England Biolabs), respectively. The GST-JACOP fusion protein then was produced in Escherichia coli. DH5-α was purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and subcutaneously injected into rabbits to raise anti-JACOP pAb. Anti-JACOP pAb was used for experiments after affinity purification. The obtained rabbit serum was incubated with nitrocellulose membranes blotted with the maltose-binding protein-JACOP fusion protein produced in E. coli, and the bound antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine buffer, pH 2.8, followed by neutralization to pH 7.5 with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. To produce rat anti-mouse cingulin mAb, an expression construct of the GST fusion protein containing aa 216–419 of mouse cingulin was generated by subcloning the corresponding DNA fragment amplified by PCR into pGEX4T-1. The GST-cingulin fusion protein was produced in E. coli, purified, and injected into rats. mAb production was performed as described previously (6Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-afadin monoclonal antibody (40Sakisaka T. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Miyahara M. Satoh A. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Yoshimi Takai (Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan). Mouse anti-ZO-1 monoclonal antibody (T8–754) was generated and characterized as reported previously (41Itoh M. Yonemura S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1449-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-HA tag mAb and rat anti-HA tag mAb were purchased from Covance and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Actin filaments were labeled with Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cell Culture and Transfection—Eph4 cells (a gift from Dr. Reichmann, Institute Suisse de Recherches, Lausanne, Switzerland), L cells, and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h in culture, cells were analyzed by immunoblotting or immunostaining. To obtain stable transfectants of Eph4 cells expressing j582–1298, cells were replated after 48 h after transfection and cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE (10%) was performed according to the method of Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and the gels were stained with a silver-staining kit (Wako Pure Chemicals). For Western blotting, proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE were electrophoretically transferred from gels to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-JACOP rabbit serum or culture supernatant of anti-cingulin monoclonal antibody followed by biotinylated secondary antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Nitro blue tetrazolium and bromochloroindoryl phosphate were used as substrates for the detection of alkaline phosphatase. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To analyze the distribution of JACOP, various mouse tissues were cut in pieces and embedded in O.C.T. compound using liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (∼5-μm thick) were cut in a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, air-dried, and fixed in 95% ethanol at 4 °C for 30 min followed by 100% acetone at room temperature for 1 min. They were then washed with PBS, incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 10 min, and finally incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 30 min. After being washed with PBS, samples were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies. For the immunostaining of cultured cells, cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. They were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 10 min, the samples were treated with primary antibodies, washed with PBS, and finally incubated with secondary antibodies. As secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG, and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories) were used. After being washed with PBS, samples were mounted in 90% glycerol-PBS containing 0.1% para-phenylenediamine and 1% n-propylgalate. Specimens were observed using a Zeiss Axio-phot photomicroscope or Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Immunoelectron Microscopy—Immunoelectron microscopy using the silver-enhancement immunogold method was performed as described previously with some modifications (43Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 202: 1235-1243Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Frozen sections (∼10-μm thick) of tissues fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde were incubated with anti-JACOP pAb followed by a second Ab coupled with 1.4-nm gold particles (Nanoprobes Inc.). The sample-bound gold particles were silver-enhanced with the HQ-silver enhancement kit (Nanoprobes Inc.) at 25 °C for 8 min. After washes with distilled water, samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium oxide in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. They were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, and 100%) and propylene oxide and embedded in epoxy resin. From these samples, ultrathin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then observed with a Hitachi H7500 electron microscope. Purification and cDNA Cloning of JACOP—We previously reported the identification of a novel 155-kDa protein (p155) localizing at epithelial and endothelial cell-cell junctions using the monoclonal antibody E14, which was produced in a rat immunized with a cell-cell junction-enriched plasma membrane fraction isolated from chick liver (37Hirase T. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 174-181PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize p155, we attempted to clone its cDNA. Using protein G beads covalently coupled with E14 monoclonal antibody, the chicken p155 protein was purified from the peripheral membrane proteins extracted from the cell-cell junction-enriched plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 1A). From the protease-digested chicken p155 protein, amino acid sequences of four peptides were determined, one of which corresponded to a peptide sequence encoded by a mouse EST in the data base with high homology (Fig. 1B, Peptide 4). The full-length cDNA of this EST was cloned by hybridization screening of cDNA libraries of mouse lung and mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells. The entire open reading frame of the obtained cDNA clone encodes 1,298 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of ∼150 kDa, which is comparable with the molecular mass of p155 observed on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the amino acid sequence predicted from the obtained cDNA contains sequences homologous to the remaining three chicken peptides, indicating that we certainly cloned the mouse homologue of p155 (Fig. 1, B and C). Coils, Paircoil, and Multicoil programs predicted an extended dimeric coiled-coil structure in the C-terminal half (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal half was not predicted to contain a coiled-coil and was likely to assume a globular structure. Downstream of the coiled-coil domain, there was another small domain. We referred to these three domains as the head, rod, and tail from the N terminus (Fig. 2B) and designated this novel protein JACOP (junction-associated coiled-coil protein). A homology search of the databases revealed that the C-terminal half of the amino acid sequence shared similarity with the α-helical coiled-coil domain of various proteins, among which cingulin, a cytoplasmic component of TJs, was most related to JACOP (Fig. 2B). The coiled-coil domains of JACOP and mouse cingulin were 39% identical at the amino acid level (Fig. 2B). In addition, JACOP and cingulin had two highly homologous regions in their head domains, confirming the structural similarity between these two proteins (Fig. 2C). The JACOP gene appeared to be conserved among mammalian species. The human and rat (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_032866 and XM_236385, respectively) homologues of JACOP were 85 and 94% identical to mouse JACOP at the amino acid level, respectively (data not shown). To examine the tissue distribution of JACOP, Northern blot analysis was performed using mRNAs prepared from various mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 3, a single band of ∼8 kb was detected in most tissues including non-epithelial ones. JACOP mRNA was detected in large amounts in the kidney and lung, whereas only a trac"

Accordingly, the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex binds not only to clathrin and select cargo molecules, but also to an extensive family of endocytic accessory factors and alternate sorting adaptors. Physical associations between accessory proteins and AP-2 occur primarily through DP(F/W) or FXDXF motifs, which engage an interaction surface positioned on the C-terminal platform subdomain of the independently folded α subunit appendage. Here, we find that the WXX(F/W)X(D/E) interaction motif found in several endocytic proteins, including synaptojanin 1, stonin 2, AAK1, GAK, and NECAP1, binds a second interaction site on the bilobal α appendage, located on the N-terminal β sandwich subdomain. Both α appendage binding sites can be engaged synchronously, and our data reveal that varied assemblies of interaction motifs with different affinities for two sites upon the α appendage can provide a mechanism for temporal ordering of endocytic accessory proteins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis depends upon the coordinated assembly of a large number of discrete clathrin coat components to couple cargo selection with rapid internalization from the cell surface.

Clathrin-coated vesicles are a major portal of entry into eukaryotic cells, carrying macromolecular nutrients, ligands, select transmembrane proteins, and even viruses into the cell interior from the plasma membrane (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3016) Google Scholar, 2Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Cargo selectivity of these short-lived transport intermediates is often thought to be governed by a central triad of proteins, the cargo receptors, clathrin, and the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex. Cargo receptors contain cytosolic internalization sequences, such as the YXXØ motif (where X is any amino acid and Ø represents a residue with a bulky hydrophobic side chain), found within proteins like the receptor for the endocytosed iron transport protein transferrin. Several distinct internalization sequences or tags are known, each specifying internalization by promoting preferential incorporation into assembling clathrincoated vesicles (3Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Clathrin functions as a trimer of heterodimers, composed of three 192-kDa heavy and three 20–25-kDa light chains, that polymerize to form the characteristic polyhedral clathrin lattice (4Brodsky F.M. Chen C.Y. Knuehl C. Towler M.C. Wakeham D.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 517-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 5Lafer E.M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Assembled clathrin appears to act as a mechanical scaffold during the process of bud invagination. AP-2, the archetypical sorting adaptor, is composed of two large (∼100 kDa) subunits (α and β2), a 50-kDa medium μ2 subunit, and a 17-kDa small σ2 chain (2Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 6Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). AP-2 binds physically to both clathrin, through the hinge and appendage domains of the β2 subunit (7Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Pearse B.M. McMahon H.T. Evans P.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4216-4227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to YXXØ-type internalization sequences, via the μ2 subunit, in a phosphorylation-regulated manner (6Collins B.M. McCoy A.J. Kent H.M. Evans P.R. Owen D.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 8Olusanya O. Andrews P.D. Swedlow J.R. Smythe E. Curr.

AP-2 is therefore a multifunctional protein that couples coat assembly with cargo selection.Surprisingly, after small interfering RNA silencing of either the AP-2 α or μ2 subunit mRNA in HeLa cells to deplete cellular AP-2 adaptor levels, certain transmembrane receptors, like the epidermal growth factor and low density lipoprotein receptors, still internalize efficiently in a clathrin-dependent manner (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). This demonstrates that AP-2 is not absolutely essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in cultured mammalian cells. Yet, small interfering RNA knockdown of AP-2 decreases the abundance of clathrin-coated structures at the cell surface by >90% (11Motley A. Bright N.A. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and severe mutation of the AP-2 α subunit in Drosophila melanogaster (12Gonzalez-Gaitan M. Jackle H. Cell. 1997; 88: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) or targeted disruption of the μ2 subunit genes in mice 1J. S. Bonifacino, personal communication.1J. S. Bonifacino, personal communication. is lethal. Thus, the AP-2 adaptor does play a pivotal role in clathrin coat dynamics at the plasma membrane.In addition to binding YXXØ-type internalization sequences, AP-2 also binds, via the independently folded α and β2 subunit appendages that project off the heterotetrameric core, to at least 12 endocytic accessory proteins and alternate adaptors (2Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 5Lafer E.M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 13Traub L.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). These interactions depend upon short interaction motifs or ligands often tandemly arrayed in structurally disordered segments of the AP-2-binding proteins. Two discrete sequences, the DP(F/W) and FXDXF motifs, bind to a partially overlapping site on the α appendage (14Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Several endocytic proteins contain both of these, as well as a recently identified third α appendage-binding sequence, the WXX(F/W)X(D/E) motif (15Ritter B. Philie J. Girard M. Tung E.C. Blondeau F. McPherson P.S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

A. 2004; 101: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although these interaction motifs seem responsible, in part, for placement of endocytic accessory proteins and alternate adaptors at bud sites on the plasma membrane, how the complex web of protein-protein interactions is regulated, how temporally ordered recruitment is achieved, and the physiological benefit of one type of interaction motif over another are currently unknown. In this study, we show that the WXX(F/W)X(D/E) motif engages the crystallographically identified Trp-specific binding site on the β sandwich subdomain of the appendage that is distant from the major DP(F/W)/FXDXF-binding site on the platform subdomain of the αC appendage (14Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The sandwich site increases the number of αC appendage binding modes, and we propose a model for hierarchical protein recruitment based on the representation of different interaction motifs with different affinities positioned within intrinsically disordered domains of endocytic αC appendage-binding proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA and Plasmids—The GST 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry.-fused αC appendage and its mutants W840A, R905A, and R916A; GST-SJ170M1, GST-SJ170C2, SJ170C2(FD → A), and SJ170C2(W → A); and GST-stonin 2-(1–426) have been described previously (14Brett T.J.

The GST-fused αC appendage mutants R707S, N712Y, G725N, K727A, R731A, F740D, and Q782A and the GST-stonin 2-(1–247), GST-stonin 2-(1–117), GST-stonin 2-(1–30), GST-stonin 2-(1–247), GST-stonin 2(W3 → A), GST-stonin 2(W2 → A), GST-stonin 2(W1 → A), GST-stonin 2(W2,3 → A), and GST-stonin 2(W1,2,3 → A) constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) and the appropriate mutagenic primers. 3Sequences are available upon request. The full-length GFP-stonin 2 construct was generated by inserting the missing N-terminal residues into a GFP-stonin 2 vector (19Martina J.A. Bonangelino C.J. Aguilar R.C. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1111-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. Juan Bonifacino. First, the internal BclI site in the GFP-stonin 2-(204–905) plasmid was inactivated by QuikChange mutagenesis. Then, residues 1–426 of stonin 2 were amplified by PCR from human clone C14981 (Stratagene) with primers 5′-TTAAGCTTATATGACTTTGGACCATGTG-3′ and 5′-AAGCGGCCGCCTAGTCACGAGGCTGGGACCG-3′, digested with HindIII and BclI, purified, and ligated into the HindIII- and BclI-digested GFP-stonin 2 plasmid. This procedure inserts residues 1–393, generating full-length stonin 2-(1–905) fused in-frame to the C terminus of GFP in pEGFP-C1. GFP-stonin 2(W2,3 → A) was generated as outlined above. All clones and mutations were verified by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing.Recombinant Proteins, Cell Extracts, and Antibodies—GST and the various GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21. The standard induction protocol entails shifting log-phase cultures (A600 ∼ 0.6) from 37 °C to room temperature and then adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 3–5 h at room temperature with constant shaking, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at -80 °C until used. Bacteria were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm sodium chloride, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol with sonication or in B-PER reagent (Pierce). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 23,700 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C, and the GST fusions were then collected on GSH-Sepharose. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, GST fusions were eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm GSH, and 5 mm dithiothreitol on ice and dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline and 1 mm dithiothreitol before use in binding assays. For some experiments, proteins were cleaved off the GST with thrombin, and then d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem), an irreversible thrombin inhibitor, was added to 25 μm. For quantitative affinity measurements, thrombin-cleaved αC appendage was further purified by gel filtration over a Superdex S200 column.Cytosol was prepared from frozen rat brain (Pel-Freez Biologicals) by sequential differential centrifugation after homogenization in 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The 105,000 × gmax supernatant is defined as cytosol and was stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. PC12 cell lysates were prepared after collecting the cells by trypsinization and washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Pelleted PC12 cells were solubilized in 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min in the presence of Complete protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × gmax for 15 min at 4 °C, aliquots of the lysate were stored frozen at -80 °C. Before use, thawed samples of either rat brain cytosol or PC12 cell lysates were adjusted to 25 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 2mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (assay buffer) by addition of a 10× stock and then centrifuged at 245,000 × gmax (TLA-100.4 rotor) for 20 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble particulate material.Polyclonal serum against NECAP1 was generously provided by Dr. Peter McPherson, whereas the anti-μ2 subunit serum was a generous gift from Dr. Juan Bonifacino. Polyclonal antibodies against SNX9 (sorting nexin-9) were generated in rabbits using residues 1–240 of SNX9 as the antigen. Affinity-purified anti-Numb antibodies were generously provided by Dr. Kozo Kaibuchi. Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies to epsin 1, Disabled-2 (Dab2), and synaptojanin 1 (recognizing both SJ145 and SJ170) have been described (14Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H.

Anti-AP-2 α subunit mAb 100/2 was a generous gift of Dr. Ernst Ungewickell, and the anti-CALM mAb was a generous gift from Dr. Jeong-Ah Kim. Monoclonal antibodies directed against AP180 and amphiphysin were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-HIP1 mAb 1C5 was from Novus Biologicals.Protein Binding Studies—Pull-down-type assays (in a 300-μl total volume) were performed as described (14Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol.

Typically, 50–400 μg of GST and the GST fusion proteins were first each immobilized upon ∼25-μl packed GSH-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous mixing. The Sepharose beads containing the required immobilized proteins were washed and resuspended to 50 μl in assay buffer. Clarified rat brain cytosol, PC12 cell lysates, or purified thrombin-cleaved αC appendage (in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin) was added, and the tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with continuous gentle mixing. For the competition assays, a WXX(F/W)X(D/E) peptide (ISNWVQFEDDTP) or thrombin-cleaved proteins (in the presence of 25 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone) were added directly to the assay mixture. The GSH-Sepharose beads were then recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × gmax for 1 min at 4 °C, and an aliquot of each supernatant was removed and adjusted to 100 μl with SDS sample buffer. After washing the GSH-Sepharose pellets four times each with ∼1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated, and each pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer.ITC Experiments—The SJ170 KGWVTFEE peptide was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Paul Allen (Washington University). Superdex S200-purified αC appendages were concentrated, and proteins and peptides were then prepared for ITC by overnight dialysis against buffer containing 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.5), 100 mm sodium chloride, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. All ITC experiments were carried out at 30 °C using a VP-ITC instrument (MicroCal) at Washington University. Typically, the cell contained 1.4 ml of 100 μm α appendage, and the SJ170 WXXF peptide, at a concentration of 1 mm, was titrated in 30 injections of 10 μl each. The exception was the α appendage mutant R905A, which, because of low expression and solubility, was run with a protein concentration of 30 μm and a peptide concentration of 0.90 mm. Traces were corrected by subtracting blank measurements of the SJ170 WXXF peptide injected into the ITC buffer and analyzed using Origin Version 5.0 (MicroCal). Binding constants were calculated by fitting the integrated data to a one-site binding model.Cells, Transfection, Immunofluorescence, and Freeze-etch Electron Microscopy—Normal rat kidney cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine, and undifferentiated PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine. HeLa SS6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were passaged onto 12-mm glass coverslips 1 day prior to transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000. One day after transfection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and prepared for immunofluorescence as described previously (20Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Agostinelli N.R. Watkins S.C.

For transferrin internalization, cells were serum-starved for 1 h, pulsed with 25 μg/ml biotin-labeled transferrin for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and fixed.For freeze-etch immunogold analysis, cells were cultured on small oriented pieces of carbon-coated glass coverslip and ruptured by sonication to generate “unroofed” cell cortices precisely as described (21Heuser J.

After washing with 30 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.3), 70 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, and 3 mm EGTA (HKMgE buffer), the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.025% glutaraldehyde in HKMgE buffer, quenched with 50 mm ammonium chloride and 50 mm l-lysine in HKMgE buffer, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in HKMgE buffer. Coverslips were then incubated with anti-AP-2 α subunit mAb AP.6 (22Chin D.J. Straubinger R.M. Acton S. Nathke I. Brodsky F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yet, in affinity interaction assays in vitro, addition of a 250-fold molar excess of a stonin 2-derived 90ISNWVQFEDDTP peptide, which effectively prevented NECAP1 binding and significantly blunted SJ170 interactions with GST-αC appendage (Fig. 1A, compare lane f with lane d), has little effect on the association of epsin 1 or amphiphysin I with the immobilized appendage (15Ritter B.

This finding suggests that the WXX(F/W)X(D/E) motif might be accommodated by a site separate from the platform subdomain on the α appendage. Because the WXX(F/W)X(D/E) motif has an absolute requirement for Trp at the 0 position (16Jha A. Agostinelli N.R. Mishra S.K. Keyel P.A. Hawryluk M.J. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2281-2290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we examined the contribution of residues located on the sandwich subdomain of the αC appendage (Fig. 2, A–C) that we previously showed crystallographically create a Trp-specific binding site (14Brett T.J.

Purified monomeric αC appendage bound to a minimal SJ170 (1478SNPKGWVTFEEE, GST-SJ170M1)-derived WXX(F/W)X(D/E) motif immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2D). The majority of the αC appendage sedimented with the GST-SJ170M1 fusion (lane d), whereas the appendage remained soluble (lane a) in the presence of GST alone (lane b). Alteration of select residues on one face of the N-terminal sandwich, composed of β strands A′, A, B, and E, perturbed the association of the αC appendage with the immobilized WXX(F/W)X(D/E) motif. The effect of a Q782A substitution was most severe, whereas a G725N mutation also blunted appendage binding significantly (Fig. 2D). Based on the structure of the apo-αC appendage (Fig. 2B) (18Traub L.M. Downs M.A. Westrich J.L. Fremont D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The G725N substitution likely fills much of the pocket required to accommodate the Trp residue (Fig. 2C). Altering several other side chains on the sandwich (Table I) revealed that Phe740 is also required for productive interactions with the SJ170 WXX(F/W)X(D/E) model protein, whereas a K727A substitution had a negligible effect (Fig. 2D). Several other side chains in the vicinity of the sandwich binding pocket did not affect appendage binding in this assay when mutated (Table I).Fig. 2A tryptophan-specific WXX(F/W)X(D/E)-binding site on the β sandwich subdomain of the αC appendage.A, shown is a schematic of the AP-2 adaptor based on the crystal structure of the heterotetrameric AP-2 core and illustrating the various protein and phospholipid interaction regions.

Here, we investigated the interactions of InsP3- and cAMP-mediated signaling pathways activated by dopamine in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN). We found that in ∼40% of the MSN, application of dopamine elicited robust repetitive Ca2+ transients (oscillations). In pharmacological experiments with specific agonists and antagonists, we found that the observed Ca2+ oscillations were triggered by activation of D1 class dopamine receptors (DARs). We further demonstrated that activation of phospholipase C was required for induction of dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations and that maintenance of dopamine-evoked Ca2+ oscillations required both Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ mobilization from internal Ca2+ stores. In “priming” experiments with a type 2 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist, we have shown a likely role for calcyon in coupling D1 class DARs with Ca2+ oscillations in MSN. In experiments with the DAR-specific agonist SKF83959, we discovered that phospholipase C activation alone could not account for dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations. We further demonstrated that direct activation of protein kinase A by 8-bromo-cAMP or inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) or calcineurin (PP2B) resulted in elevation of basal Ca2+ levels in MSN, but not in Ca2+ oscillations. In experiments with competitive peptides, we have shown an importance of type 1 InsP3 receptor association with PP1α and with AKAP9·protein kinase A for dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations. In experiments with MSN from DARPP-32 knock-out mice, we demonstrated a regulatory role of DARPP-32 in dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations. Our results indicate that, following D1 class DAR activation, InsP3 and cAMP signaling pathways converge on the type 1 InsP3 receptor, resulting in Ca2+ oscillations in MSN.

In experiments with striatal slices, we demonstrated transient phosphorylation of striatal InsP3R1 by PKA in response to dopamine and proposed that InsP3R1 may participate in cross-talk between cAMP and Ca2+ dopaminergic signaling pathways in the striatum (39Tang T.-S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 403-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we used Ca2+ imaging techniques to investigate dopamine-induced Ca2+ signals in primary cultures of striatal MSN. DARPP-32 Knock-out Mice—The generation and breeding of DARPP-32 knock-out mice (C57BL/6; a kind gift of Dr. Paul Greengard) were described previously (26Fienberg A.A. Hiroi N. Mermelstein P.G.

The brains of day 14.5-15.5 embryos from wild-type (D32+/+) and DARPP-32 knock-out (D32-/-) mice were collected, and the striata were dissected. The striatal lysates of wild-type and D32-/- embryos were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-DARPP-32 monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies). Primary Cultures of Rat and Mouse MSN—Primary cultures of rat MSN were established from day 17-18 rat embryos as described previously (42Tang T.-S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The mouse MSN cultures were established with some modifications of the protocol used for rat MSN culture. Briefly, using landmarks described previously (43Howe A.R. Surmeier D.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), striata were dissected from brains of D32+/+ and D32-/- embryonic mice in ice-cold dissection solution (1× divalent-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, 15 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), pH 7.2). The striata from mice with identical genotypes were pooled and treated with 0.25% trypsin for 7 min at 37 °C. After addition of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), the tissue was dissociated with trituration solution (1× divalent-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and 1.0% DNase I, pH 7.2) (44Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar) by repetitive pipetting. The cells were washed; plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml on 12-mm round coverslips precoated with poly-d-lysine (Mr = 30,000-70,000, 0.01% final concentration) in plating medium containing 60% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30% Neurobasal medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin; and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 24 h later, the cultures were transferred to culture medium (65% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 30% Neurobasal medium, 1× B27 (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin). 4 μm cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) was added at 2-4 days in vitro (DIV) to inhibit glial cell growth. The cultures were fed with fresh culture medium every 7 days. The identity of established cultures was confirmed in immunostaining experiments with anti-GAD65 monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon International, Inc.). Ca2+ Imaging Experiments—Ca2+ imaging experiments with 18-20 DIV rat and 16-18 DIV mouse MSN were performed as described previously (42Tang T.-S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, MSN were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) for 45 min at 37 °C. For imaging experiments, the coverslips were mounted on a recording/perfusion chamber (RC-26G, Warner Instruments) maintained at 37 °C (PH1, Warner Instruments), positioned on the movable stage of an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope, and perfused with ACSF by gravity flow. For some experiments (see below), the culture was washed extensively with Ca2+-free ACSF (CaCl2 was omitted from ACSF, which was supplemented with 100 μm EGTA). Following Fura-2 loading, the MSN cells were intermittently excited by 340- and 380-nm UV light (DeltaRAM illuminator, PTI) using a Fura-2 dichroic filter cube (Chroma Technologies) and a 60× UV light-grade oil immersion objective (Olympus). The emitted light was collected by an IC-300 camera (PTI), and the images were digitized by ImageMaster Pro software (PTI). Base-line (1-3 min) measurements were obtained prior to bath application of dopamine dissolved in ACSF or Ca2+-free ACSF. Others drugs were applied to the recording chamber as described below. The dopamine and drug solutions were prewarmed to 37 °C before application to MSN. Images at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths were captured every 5 s, and 340/380 nm ratio image traces were recorded. Background fluorescence was determined according to the manufacturer's (PTI) recommendations and subtracted. R9 Peptide Loading Experiments—R9 (RRRRRRRRR) and R9-IC (RRRRRRRRRGHPPHMNVNPQQPA) peptides were chemically synthesized (University of Texas Southwestern Protein Chemistry Technology Center), coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at the N terminus, and dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. In loading experiments, the R9 peptides were added to rat MSN for 10 min at 50 μm. Following R9 peptide loading, neurons were washed and incubated in culture medium for ∼2 h prior to Ca2+ imaging experiments. As judged by FITC fluorescence, >90% of the MSN were loaded with the R9 and R9-IC peptides in these experiments. Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) and EGFP-RT1-Leucine/Isoleucine Zipper (LIZ) Transfections—The EGFP-RT1-LIZ construct was generated by subcloning the PCR-amplified LIZ region of rat InsP3R1 (amino acids 1251-1287) (40Tu H. Tang T.-S. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19375-19382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) into the pEGFP-C3 expression vector (Clontech) and verified by sequencing. The pEGFP-C3 expression vector without an insert was used as a negative control (EGFP). The rat MSN cultures at 19-20 DIV were transfected with the EGFP or EGFP-RT1-LIZ plasmid by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (42Tang T.-S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z.

Prior to Ca2+ imaging experiments, EGFP- and EGFPRT1-LIZ-transfected MSN were identified by GFP imaging as described previously (42Tang T.-S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L.

Drugs—SKF83959 was provided by the National Institute of Mental Health Synthesis Program (Menlo Park, CA). Dopamine hydrobromide, atropine sulfate, U73122, U73343, thapsigargin, 8-bromo (Br)-cAMP, calyculin A, cyclosporin A, and okadaic acid were from Calbiochem.

Dopamine Induces Ca2+ Oscillations in MSN—To test the effects of dopamine stimulation on Ca2+ signaling, we performed Ca2+ imaging experiments with primary cultures of MSN established from embryonic day 18 rats as described previously (42Tang T.-S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 46Mao L. Wang J.Q. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To monitor intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, MSN were loaded with the ratiometric Ca2+ imaging dye Fura-2, and the intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations were estimated from the ratio of Fura-2 emission at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths (340/380 nm ratio). On average, the basal levels of 340/380 nm ratios in unstimulated MSN were equal to 0.52 ± 0.05 (n = 29). Approximately 40% of the cultured MSN (20 DIV) in our experiments displayed repetitive Ca2+ transients (oscillations) in response to application of 400 μm dopamine (Fig. 1, A and B). On average (n = 29 MSN), these Ca2+ oscillations started 5.1 ± 2.2 min after dopamine application, had an amplitude of 0.89 ± 0.1, occurred with a frequency of 12 ± 6 spikes/20 min, and lasted at least 20-30 min. D1 Class Receptors Specifically Mediate Dopamine-evoked Ca2+ Oscillations in MSN—Striatal MSN abundantly express multiple subtypes of DARs (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar, 4Vallone D. Picetti R. Borrelli E. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2000; 24: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 5Surmeier D.J. Song W.J. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6579-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gerfen C.R. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Based on pharmacological and molecular properties, DARs are divided into two classes: D1 and D2. Which DAR class mediates the dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations observed in our experiments (Fig. 1)? To answer this question, we performed a series of experiments with D1 and D2 class receptor-specific antagonists and agonists. We found that the dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations (Figs. 1 and 2A) in MSN were completely blocked in the presence of 5 μm SCH23390 (D1 class DAR antagonist) and 5 μm spiperone (D2 class DAR antagonist) (Fig. 2B). We further found that blockade of D2 class DARs by 5 μm spiperone had only a minor effect on dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2C), whereas blockade of D1 class DARs by 5 μm SCH23390 resulted in almost complete suppression of dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2D). In complementary experiments, we found that the D1 class DAR-specific agonist SKF38393 (50 μm) induced Ca2+ oscillations in MSN (Fig. 2E), whereas the D2 class DAR-specific agonist quinpirole (10 μm) was much less effective (Fig. 2F). Characteristically, application of quinpirole resulted in an instant Ca2+ spike (Fig. 2F), whereas application of SKF38393 resulted in Ca2+ oscillations with a delay of several minutes (Fig. 2E), as observed after application of dopamine (Figs. 1B and 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that activation of either D1 or D2 class DARs leads to Ca2+ responses in MSN, but that D1 class DARs are coupled to Ca2+ oscillations more efficiently and via a different mechanism than D2 class DARs. Classical D1 class DARs (D1R and D5R) are coupled to cAMP production and not to PLC activation and InsP3-induced Ca2+ release. What is an explanation for the Ca2+ signals observed in our experiments (Figs. 1 and 2)? One possibility is that 400 μm dopamine may facilitate action potential firing in MSN cultures, which will lead to Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. To test this possibility, we performed experiments in the presence of 2 μm TTX, a specific voltage-gated Na+ channel blocker that inhibits action potential firing in striatal neurons (48Nisenbaum E.S. Wilson C.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4449-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wilson C.J. Kawaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2397-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of MSN with 2 μm TTX had no effect on dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 3A), indicating that the observed responses were not due to action potential firing in MSN cultures. Another possibility is that 400 μm dopamine can nonspecifically activate other PLC-linked neurotransmitter receptors expressed in MSN, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2 (5-HT2) receptors, α1-adrenoreceptors, and muscarinic type acetylcholine receptors (50Hoyer D. Hannon J.P. Martin G.R. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 2002; 71: 533-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 51Harrison J.K. Pearson W.R. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 62-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 52Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of any of these receptors is involved in dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations, we repeated experiments in the presence of 20 μm ketanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonist), 10 μm prazosin (α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist), and 5 μm atropine (muscarinic type acetylcholine receptor antagonist). To rule out activation of D2 receptors (also coupled to PLC), we also included 5 μm spiperone (D2 class DAR antagonist). Preincubation of MSN with a TTX/spiperone/ketanserin/prazosin/atropine mixture had no significant effect on dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 3B), confirming that dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations are mediated primarily by D1 class DARs, with a minor contribution from D2 class DARs (Fig. 2F). In additional control experiments, we studied Ca2+ signals in MSN induced by 5-HT2 receptor activation. We found that application of 100 μm α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2 receptor-specific agonist) in the presence of 2 μm TTX induced one large Ca2+ spike, which was occasionally followed by one to two spikes of much smaller amplitude (Fig. 3C). These responses were completely eliminated in the presence of 20 μm ketanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonist) (Fig. 3D). Thus, MSN Ca2+ signals mediated by 5-HT2 receptors differ from dopamine-induced responses because 1) Ca2+ transients in response to dopamine occurred with a lag time of 3-7 min, and the first Ca2+ transient in response to α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine occurred instantly (Fig. 3C); 2) multiple Ca2+ transients of equal amplitude (oscillations) were observed in response to dopamine, but only one large transient and one to two much smaller transients were observed in response to α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (Fig. 3C); and 3) dopamine-induced Ca2+ transients were not sensitive to ketanserin (Fig. 3B), but α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine-induced Ca2+ transients were completely blocked by ketanserin (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the dopamine-induced Ca2+ oscillations in our experiments were mediated predominantly by D1 class DARs, but not by 5-HT2 receptors. Ca2+ Influx Is Required for Maintenance of Dopamine-induced Ca2+ Oscillations in MSN—The dopamine-induced increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration observed in our experiments (Figs. 1, 2, 3) could result from Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ st"
https://openalex.org/W2054115369,"BBK32 is a fibronectin-binding lipoprotein on Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Analysis using secondary structure prediction programs suggested that BBK32 is composed of two domains, an N-terminal segment lacking well defined secondary structure and a C-terminal segment composed largely of α-helices. Analysis of purified recombinant forms of the two domains by circular dichroism spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and intrinsic viscosity determination were consistent with an N-terminal-extended, unstructured segment and a C-terminal globular domain in BBK32. Solid phase binding experiments suggest that the unstructured N-terminal domain binds fibronectin. Analysis of changes in circular dichroism spectra of the N-terminal segment of BBK32 upon binding of the N-terminal domain of fibronectin revealed an increase in β-sheet content in the complex. Hence, BBK32, which belongs to a different family of proteins and shows no overall sequence similarity with the fibronectin binding MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) of Gram-positive bacteria, binds fibronectin by a mechanism that is reminiscent of the “tandem β-zipper” previously demonstrated for the fibronectin binding of streptococcal adhesins (Schwarz-Linek, U., Werner, J.

Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that can be transmitted to a mammalian host during the blood meal of infected ticks (1Burgdorfer W. Barbour A.G. Hayes S.F. Benach J.L. Grunwaldt E. Davis J.P. Science. 1982; 216: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2146) Google Scholar). The molecular pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood, and the microbial virulence factors involved remain largely unknown. B. burgdorferi has a small genome composed of a 0.9-megabase chromosome and multiple linear and circular plasmids totaling 0.6 megabases (2Casjens S. Palmer N. van Vugt R. Huang W.M. Stevenson B. Rosa P. Lathigra R. Sutton G. Peterson J. Dodson R.J. Haft D. Hickey E. Gwinn M. White O. Fraser C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 490-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the B. burgdorferi genome did not reveal any obvious virulence factors such as toxins. Instead, components exposed on the surface of the organism that are capable of interacting with targets in the host may play key roles in the disease process. Lyme disease progresses in several discrete steps. Initially bacteria need to travel against the flow of blood from the tick salivary gland to the host and colonize the dermis at the site of the tick bite (3Ribeiro J.M. Mather T.N. Piesman J. Spielman A. J. Med. Entomol. 1987; 24: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This initial infection, which often is accompanied by a local inflammatory response called erythema migrans, is followed by a dissemination step. Through hematogenous spread, the spirochetes can find their way to and colonize essentially all tissues in infected animals. Disseminated Borrelia infections can cause neurological, ocular, cutaneous, cardiac, and arthritic disease (4Nadelman R.B. Wormser G.P. Lancet. 1998; 352: 557-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Steere A.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Untreated infection can persist for months or years, and these extracellular pathogens apparently survive the attacks of the host defense systems (4Nadelman R.B. Wormser G.P. Lancet. 1998; 352: 557-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Even after appropriate antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease, a small percentage of patients have “chronic Lyme disease,” which often is manifested by musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive difficulties, or fatigue that can continue for years (5Steere A.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Presumably the different stages of Lyme disease involve different sets of virulence factors. The transition of the spirochetes from the tick to mammals involves exposure to dramatically different environments with significant changes in temperature, pH, and composition of nutrients (6Stevenson B. Schwan T.G. Rosa P.A. Infect Immun. 1995; 63: 4535-4539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ramamoorthy R. Scholl-Meeker D. Infect.

Genome-wide transcriptional analysis of B. burgdorferi, cultured under different in vitro conditions designed to mimic such a transition, revealed significant regulation of subsets of genes (9Revel A.T. Talaat A.M. Norgard M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1562-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The transcription of a subfamily of genes encoding putative lipoproteins potentially exposed at the surface of the spirochete is dramatically up-regulated as the bacteria are grown in conditions mimicking the environment encountered in the mammalian host (9Revel A.T.

Johnson B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Fn in the host is exploited by many pathogenic bacteria as a target for microbial adhesion and colonization during the early stage of the infection process (for reviews, see Refs. 16Joh D. Wann E.R. Kreikemeyer B. Speziale P. Hook M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and 17Schwarz-Linek U. Höök M. Potts J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fn is a dimeric glycoprotein present in a soluble form in body fluids such as blood plasma and in a fibrillar form in the extracellular matrix of loose connective tissue. Fn participates in many physiological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival through interactions with a variety of extracellular macromolecules and cellular receptors of the integrin family (18Johansson S. Svineng G. Wennerberg K. Armulik A. Lohikangas L. Front Biosci. 1997; 2: 126-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 19Mosher D.F. Fibronectin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). Bacteria expressing Fn binding MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) have been shown to interact not only with fibrillar Fn during bacterial adhesion but also to bind soluble Fn to their surfaces. The bacteria-bound Fn can then be targeted by appropriate integrins in a process leading to microbial invasion of the host cell (20Ozeri V. Rosenshine I. Mosher D.F. Fassler R. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 21Ozeri V. Tovi A. Burstein I. Natanson-Yaron S. Caparon M.G. Yamada K.M. Akiyama S.K. Vlodavsky I. Hanski E.

Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Fn binding MSCRAMMS from pathogenic staphylococci and streptococci have been shown to bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of Fn, which contains a string of five Fn type 1 (1–5F1) modules (23Potts J.R. Campbell I.D. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The Fn binding adhesin BBK32 was originally identified by Probert and Johnson (15Probert W.S. Johnson B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) by probing lysates of B. burgdorferi strain B31 isolate with Fn in Western-ligand blots. Furthermore, BBK32 was localized to the surface of the spirochete, and the attachment of B. burgdorferi to an Fn substrate was blocked by the addition of soluble recombinant BBK32. We previously localized an Fn-binding site in BBK32 to a 32-amino acid-long segment in the protein (24Probert W.S. Kim J.H. Hook M. Johnson B.J. Infect Immun. 2001; 69: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This ligand binding segment was shown to share 81–91% amino acid sequence identity with the homologous proteins encoded by bbk32 genes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia afzelii. We also identified an amino acid sequence homology in this ligand binding region of BBK32 to the so-called upstream region of protein F1, an Fn binding MSCRAMM from Streptococcus pyogenes (24Probert W.S. Kim J.H. Hook M. Johnson B.J. Infect Immun. 2001; 69: 4129-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The upstream region segment is one of the Fn binding motifs in protein F1, and it specifically binds to the collagen binding domain of Fn (25Talay S.R. Zock A. Rohde M. Molinari G. Oggioni M. Pozzi G. Guzman C.A. Chhatwal G.S. Cell Microbiol. 2000; 2: 521-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). From the observation that gelatin can partially inhibit the binding of Fn to BBK32, the collagen binding domain of Fn was suggested to contain a binding site for BBK32 (15Probert W.S. Johnson B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Antisera raised against BBK32 have been reported to protect naive mice against tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection and reduce spirochetal transmission from mammalian host to engorging ticks (26Fikrig E. Barthold S.W. Sun W. Feng W. Telford S.R. Flavell R.A. Immunity. 1997; 6: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Fikrig E. Feng W. Barthold S.W. Telford S.R. Flavell R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5344-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A continuous spirochetal expression of BBK32 in the mammalian host from the early to the late stage of the infection suggests a role for BBK32 throughout the Lyme disease process (28Anguita J. Thomas V. Samanta S. Persinski R. Hernanz C. Barthold S.W. Fikrig E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined the structural organization of BBK32 by using a number of biophysical techniques to characterize recombinant proteins representing predicted subdomains comprised of the N- and C-terminal halves of BBK32. We also have characterized conformational changes in the N-terminal subdomain of BBK32 upon Fn binding. Overall, this study demonstrates that BBK32, the spirochetal Fn binding MSCRAMM (FnBM), shows similarities to Gram-positive bacterial FnBMs in their structural organization and Fn binding mechanisms. This finding is notable since BBK32 is a surface lipoprotein oriented in the opposite direction compared with that of FnBM from the Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, BBK32 does not contain Fn binding repeating motifs that are common in FnBMs from Gram-positive bacteria. Secondary Structure Prediction—Initially, amino acid sequences representing BBK32 and the Borrelia surface proteins OspA and VlsE were analyzed using eight secondary structure prediction programs (SOPM, HNN, DPM, DSC, GORIV, PHD, PREDATOR, and SIMPA96). Consensus secondary structure predictions were provided from Pôle Bio-Informatique Lyonnais (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_seccons.html). Preliminary analysis showed that a combination of SOPM, DSC, and PHD most accurately predicted the composition of secondary structure in OspA and VlsE for which protein crystal structures have been reported (29Li H. Dunn J.J. Luft B.J. Lawson C.L Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3584-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Eicken C. Sharma V. Klabunde T. Lawrenz M.B. Hardham J.M. Norris S.J. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21691-21696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We, therefore, relied on the combination of these three programs for the secondary structure predictions of BBK32. Construction and Expression of Recombinant Fusion Proteins—Amplified DNA segments encoding BBK32 (21–354), BBK32-(56–354), BBK32-(56–205), and BBK32-(206–354) of strain B31 of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were cloned into the BamH1 and Hind III sites of pQE30 (Qiagen Inc.) (15Probert W.S. Johnson B.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 31Wann E.R. Gurusiddappa S. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13863-13871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The resulting pQE30-based plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain JM101 made competent through heat-shock treatment. Transformed JM101 were grown for 12–17 h on LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plates. Bacteria in colonies were screened for the presence of the expression plasmid with inserts by susceptibility to restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing of inserts in both directions. The constructs were transformed into E. coli strain TOPP 3 for expression of recombinant proteins. Starter cultures of E. coli TOPP 3 containing the recombinant plasmids were diluted 1:25 in LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated with shaking until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.7–0.9. Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the bacterial suspension was incubated for an additional 4 h. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a minimal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and frozen at –20 °C. Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Cells were lysed by passage through a French press at 1100 p.s.i. (SLM Instruments Inc., Rochester, NY). Cellular debris and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The cleared, lysed cell supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) of nickel-charged iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose. Bound proteins were eluted with a continuous linear gradient of imidazole (0–200 mm; total volume 200 ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.9. In the cases of BBK32-(56–354) and BBK32-(56–205), the concentration of NaCl in the buffer was increased to 500 mm to facilitate binding of the His tag of the protein to the column. EDTA (0.5 m) was added to the eluant to a final concentration of 5 mm. Eluted proteins were monitored by analyzing the absorbance at 280 nm and by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and applied to a 5-ml HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted with a continuous linear gradient of NaCl (50–500 mm; total volume 100 ml) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.9). The protein concentration in the eluted fractions was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions with high absorbance were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against PBS, 1 mm EDTA. The amino acid composition of each of the recombinant proteins was used to determine molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm (32Gill S.C. van Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar), and the protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. All samples were frozen at –20 °C or used immediately. The molecular masses of BBK32-(56–205) and BBK32-(206–354) were determined by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A&M University). Circular Dichroism (CD)—The secondary structure composition of the recombinant BBK32 proteins was examined by CD spectroscopy. Far UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter calibrated with d-10-camphorsulfonic acid employing a band pass of 1 nm and integrating over 4 s at 0.2-nm intervals. All samples were dialyzed against 10 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (1:4), pH 7.6, and diluted to a concentration of 10 μm in the same buffer. Spectra were recorded at ambient temperature in a cylindrical cuvette with a 0.2-mm path length. Twenty scans were averaged for each spectrum, and the contribution from the buffer was subtracted. The measured CD (ellipticity, θ) was converted into a mean residue weight ellipticity [θ], expressed in deg·cm2/dmol. To quantify secondary structure elements, the measured ellipticity over 260∼180 nm was converted into a CD absorption value using the SOFTSEC™ file conversion program. The CD absorbance was analyzed using five deconvolution software programs: CD Estima, Contin, Neural Network, Selcon, and Varslc1 (provided by University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (Piscataway, NJ) and D. Greenwood (Softwood Co., Brooksfield, CT)). The convoluted data were collected as three groups of secondary structure, α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil including β-turns, and expressed as an average percentage of each element with S.E. Structural changes in BBK32-(56–254), BBK32-(205–354), and FnbpA-(D123) on binding of the NTD of Fn were examined by analyzing changes in the CD. The recombinant MSCRAMM proteins were preincubated with or without the NTD of Fn for 1 h at room temperature, and the far-UV CD spectra were recorded as described above. All proteins, including free NTD, were prepared at a concentration of 10 μm so that the molar ratio of protein to ligand in the mixture was 1:1. The changes in the generated CD spectra upon NTD-MSCRAMM interaction were determined by computationally subtracting the ellipticity of the NTD-MSCRAMM complex from the added ellipticities of the free forms of the two interacting proteins. The deconvolution of the resulting spectrum was performed as described above. Gel Permeation Chromatography—The recombinant BBK32 proteins were analyzed for their effective radii (Stokes radii, Rs) in solution using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to an fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) system. Protein samples were preequilibrated with PBS, 1 mm EDTA, applied to the column, and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column was calibrated using a low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences). The standard globular proteins contained in the kit were ribonuclease A (13,700 Da), chymotrypsinogen (25,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), and albumin (67,000 Da). Blue dextran 2000 (2,000,000 Da) (Amersham Biosciences) and tyrosine (181 Da) (Sigma) were used to indicate the void volume (Vo) and the total volume (Vt), respectively. The elution volume (Ve) of each sample was measured. To define the relationships between the elution volumes of protein samples and their respective molecular weight, the Kav value for each protein was calculated using the equationKav=(Ve−Vo)/(Vt−Vo)eq.1 where Vo and Vt for the column used were 9.5 and 24.0 ml, respectively. Kav values of standard and BBK32 proteins were plotted against the logarithm of the protein molecular weights. Rs of the proteins were determined using sample elution volumes and standard curves as described in the calibration kit. Changes in elution profiles of BBK32 proteins upon increasing concentrations (0–6 m) of guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) were monitored and plotted as described above. Before analyzing the elution volumes of proteins under different denaturing conditions, each protein and the column were equilibrated with the appropriate buffer containing the indicated concentrations of GnHCl. Intrinsic Viscosity—The viscosities of the BBK32 proteins were measured using a Cannon-Ubbelohde Semi-Micro Dilution Viscometer (No. 25 L94, Cannon Instrument Co., State College, PA) with a viscometer constant, 0.001683 mm2/s2, at ambient temperature. Before measuring the viscosities, 1 ml of each protein in 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/ml concentrations was dialyzed overnight against PBS with or without 4 m urea, and the same buffer was used as a reference solution. The specific viscosity (ηsp) was determined as described previously (33House-Pompeo K. Xu Y. Joh D. Speziale P. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1379-1384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The intrinsic viscosity [η] was calculated by using the equationηsp/c=[η]+k[η]2ceq.2 where c is protein concentration, and k is a dimensionless constant. Purification of Fn and N-terminal Fragment of Fn—Human plasma was purchased from the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center (Houston, TX). Fn was purified from plasma by affinity chromatography on a gelatin-Sepharose column as described previously (34Vuento M. Vaheri A. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Gelatin (Bio-Rad) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The plasma was treated with EDTA (5 mm) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm) and was passed through a 0.45-μm filter. The filtered plasma was applied to a Sepharose 4B column equilibrated with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 (EB) to remove components that nonspecifically bind to the Sepharose column. The flow-through from the Sepharose 4B column was applied to a gelatin-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of EB, 10 column volumes of EB with 1 m NaCl, and 5 column volumes of EB containing 0.2 m arginine. Fn was finally eluted using EB containing 4 m urea and then dialyzed against PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. The dialyzed Fn was further purified by applying the Fn solution to a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was equilibrated and washed before and after applying the sample with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Fn was eluted with an NaCl gradient (150–500 mm) in the same buffer. The peak fractions were analyzed by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Fn was used immediately or stored at 4 °C. An N-terminal proteolytically derived fragment of human Fn (NTD) was either purchased from Sigma or purified from proteolytically digested Fn. To purify the NTD proteolytic fragment, Fn was digested with thermolysin as described previously (35Borsi L. Castellani P. Balza E. Siri A. Pellecchia C. De Scalzi F. Zardi L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The digestion was stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm and verified by SDS-PAGE. The NTD was purified by affinity chromatography on the B3 repeat region of FnbB (an Fn binding MSCRAMM from Streptococcus dysgalactiae (36Casolini F. Visai L. Joh D. Conaldi P.G. Toniolo A. Hook M. Speziale P. Infect Immun. 1998; 66: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) immobilized on a CNBr-activated Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Digested Fn was loaded onto the EB-equilibrated B3 repeat column and washed with 10 column volumes of EB and EB containing 1 m NaCl. Bound NTD was eluted with 4 m urea in EB. The purified NTD was dialyzed against EB and kept at –20 °C until used. To confirm the sequence identity and the molecular mass of the NTD, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing were carried out at the Baylor College of Medicine Core Laboratory, Protein Chemistry Core Facility (Houston, TX). SDS-PAGE—Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using a 4% stacking gel and a 12% resolving gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Amersham Biosciences). Prestained high molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) were used for the estimation of molecular mass. Solid Phase Binding Assay—An ELISA based binding assay was used to examine MSCRAMM ligand interactions. The washing buffer consisted of PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST), the blocking solution consisted of 2% (w/v) ovalbumin in PBS, and the dilution buffer consisted of PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. In every assay microtiter plates (Immunolon-1 microtiter plates, Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Alexandria, Va) were coated with 1 μg of ligand or antigen diluted in 50 μl of PBS, 1 mm EDTA per well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. In the Fn binding assay, Fn-coated microtiter wells were washed, blocked, and incubated with increasing concentrations of His-tag fusion BBK32 polypeptides in 100 μl of dilution buffer for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, bound recombinant polypeptides were detected with a 1:3000 dilution of anti-His monoclonal antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) in PBST and a secondary incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma) in PBST. The wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with 100 μl of a 1 mg/ml Sigma 104 alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma) dissolved in 1 m diethanolamine, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8, for 1–3 h. The absorbance at 405 nm was determined using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Sequence Analysis Indicates the Presence of Two Subdomains in BBK32—Secondary structure predictions of BBK32 using a combination of the programs SOPM, DSC, and PHD suggested that the protein can be divided into two structurally distinct subdomains, an N-terminal region (amino acid 21–205) composed largely of random coil structures and a C-terminal region (amino acid 206–354) rich in α-helices. To evaluate the reliability of this prediction, we used the combined programs to predict the secondary structure composition of two structurally different Borrelia lipoproteins, OspA and VlsE, for which the crystal structures have been determined. The SOPM-DSC-PHD combination program predicted the secondary structure compositions of these two known structures reasonably well (Table I). We, therefore, believe that the secondary structure composition predicted for BBK32 is also reliable.Table ISecondary structure prediction and CD analysis of BBK32ProteinsMethod of secondary structure prediction/determinationα-HelixaPercentile of each secondary structure component.β-SheetaPercentile of each secondary structure component.Random coilaPercentile of each secondary structure component.AmbiguousbSecondary structures were predicted completely differently.BBK32-(56-354)Secondary structure predictioncConsensus secondary structure from the eight predictions.50.52.236.60.07DSC-PHD-SOPMdAverage of DSC, PHD, and SOPM predictions.53.78.238.0CD analy"
https://openalex.org/W2025124261,"Mutations of the developmental gene Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and alterations of SHH signaling have been associated with holoprosencephaly (HPE), a rare disorder characterized by a large spectrum of brain and craniofacial anomalies. Based on the crystal structure of mouse N-terminal and Drosophila C-terminal hedgehog proteins, we have developed three-dimensional models of the corresponding human proteins (SHH-N, SHH-C) that have allowed us to identify within these two domains crucial regions associated with HPE missense mutations. We have further characterized the functional consequences linked to 11 of these mutations. In transfected HEK293 cells, the production of the active SHH-N fragment was dramatically impaired for eight mutants (W117R, W117G, H140P, T150R, C183F, L271P, I354T, A383T). The supernatants from these cell cultures showed no significant SHH-signaling activity in a reporter cell-based assay. Two mutants (G31R, D222N) were associated with a lower production of SHH-N and signaling activity. Finally, one mutant harboring the A226T mutation displays an activity comparable with the wild-type protein. This work demonstrates that most of the HPE-associated SHH mutations analyzed have a deleterious effect on the availability of SHH-N and its biological activity. However, because of the lack of correlation between genotype and phenotype for SHH-associated mutations, our study suggests that other factors intervene in the development of the spectrum of HPE anomalies.

Holoprosencephaly (HPE) 1The abbreviations used are: HPE, holoprosencephaly; AP, alkaline phosphatase; PTC, Patched; SHH, Sonic hedgehog; SHH-N, Sonic hedgehog N-terminal protein; SHH-C, Sonic hedgehog C-terminal protein; WT, wild-type. is the most common brain anomaly in humans, involving abnormal formation and septation of the developing central nervous system and occurring in 1 in 16,000 live births and 1 in 250 spontaneous abortion cases (1Roessler E. Muenke M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 15-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clinical manifestations of the disease are variable, ranging from a single cerebral ventricle and cyclopia to minor anomalies of midline structures. The etiology of HPE is extremely heterogeneous, including genetic factors and environmental agents. The majority of HPE cases are sporadic, although autosomal dominant familial cases have been described. Genetic studies have shown that more than 10 chromosomal loci are implicated in HPE and 7 genes have been already identified: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) isolated from the human critical region HPE3 on chromosome 7q36 (2Belloni E.

Mutat. 2004; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). If the deleterious role of nonsense or frame-shift mutations is evident in the pathogenesis of genetic diseases, the implication of missense mutations has to be proved. Moreover, the ability to discriminate between a loss-of-function mutation and a silent polymorphism is important for genetic testing of inherited diseases like HPE, where the opportunity for genetic counseling exists (17Verlinsky Y. Rechitsky S. Verlinsky O. Ozen S. Sharapova T. Masciangelo C. Morris R. Kuliev A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). SHH is a morphogen molecule involved in embryonic development including the induction of the floor plate and the establishment of the ventral polarity within the central nervous system (18Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). SHH is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes autocatalytic cleavage into a highly conserved N-terminal domain (SHH-N) responsible for the signaling activities of the molecule and a more divergent C-terminal domain (SHH-C) implicated in the autoproteolysis reaction and the addition of a cholesterol moiety covalently attached to the C terminus of SHH-N (19Porter J.A. Ekker S.C. Park W.J. von Kessler D.P. Young K.E. Chen C.H. Ma Y. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 21-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This cholesterol molecule is presumably important for tethering the protein to the plasma membrane and, thus, restricts the tissue localization of hedgehog signaling. The addition of another lipid, a palmitoyl group, on the N-terminal cysteine residue of SHH-N dramatically increases the biological activity of the protein (20Pepinsky R.B. Zeng C. Wen D. Rayhorn P. Baker D.P. Williams K.P. Bixler S.A. Ambrose C.M. Garber E.A. Miatkowski K. Taylor F.R. Wang E.A. Galdes A. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, these modifications of SHH may exert a key role in targeting the protein to lipid rafts (22Coulombe J. Traiffort E. Loulier K. Faure H. Ruat M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that could represent functional platforms for SHH signaling. Diffusion of a soluble cholesterol-modified multimeric form of mouse Shh-N has been proposed to mediate long range signaling during embryonic development (23Zeng X. Goetz J.A. Suber L.M. Scott Jr., W.J. Schreiner C.M. Robbins D.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). SHH mediates its action via a receptor complex associating two transmembrane proteins; that is, PTC, displaying a transporter-like structure, and Smoothened, presumably belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The repression exerted by PTC on Smoothened is relieved when SHH binds PTC, which leads to a complex signaling cascade involving the transcription factors of the Gli family and to the activation of target genes including PTC itself (18Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar, 24McMahon A.P. Ingham P.W. Tabin C.J. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 53: 1-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

During embryonic development, PTC-1 is widely expressed, whereas PTC-2 RNA distribution is more restricted (18Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar). SHH also binds HIP (hedgehog-interacting protein), a negative regulator of the pathway that sequesters and antagonizes SHH (22Coulombe J. Traiffort E. Loulier K. Faure H. Ruat M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28Chuang P.T. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1999; 397: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In rodent, Shh-N secretion from the synthesizing cell requires Dispatched, a PTC-related protein proposed to control the release of the morphogen (29Kawakami T. Kawcak T. Li Y.J. Zhang W. Hu Y.

Cell. 2002; 111: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Animal models support the concept that mutations resulting in modulation of SHH activity-signaling pathway can cause HPE. The phenotype observed in Shh knockout mice (31Chiang C. Litingtung Y. Lee E. Young K.E. Corden J.L. Westphal H. Beachy P.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar) associating cyclopia and loss of normal ventral specification in the forebrain mimics clinical manifestations of HPE. A percentage of mice with increased PTC activity driven by the nestin enhancer display a fusion of the lateral ventricles consistent with HPE (32Goodrich L.V. Jung D. Higgins K.M. Scott M.P. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Smoothened homozygous knockout mice also present cyclopia and HPE (33Zhang X.M. Ramalho-Santos M. McMahon A.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 781-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Finally, homozygous null mutant for Gli2 displays a single central maxillary incisor constituting a microform of HPE (34Hardcastle Z. Mo R. Hui C.C. Sharpe P.T. Development. 1998; 125: 2803-2811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now developed a three-dimensional model of human SHH-N and SHH-C domains that were used to highlight important regions associated with HPE mutations within both peptides. We have mutated a panel of amino acid residues associated with HPE and distributed both in SHH-N and SHH-C. We present biochemical and functional analysis of the mutated proteins and discuss their functionality in the development of HPE. Modeling the Human SHH-N and SHH-C Proteins—The three-dimensional models of the human SHH-N and SHH-C domains were constructed from the x-ray structures of mouse Shh-N (35Hall T.M.T. Porter J.A. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and Drosophila C-terminal hedgehog (hh-C) (36Hall T.M.T. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), respectively. After alignment of the amino acid sequences of the above-cited proteins using standard parameters of the ClustalW program (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), human SHH-N and SHH-C proteins were modeled using the BIOPOLYMER module of the SYBYL 6.9 package (TRIPOS Assoc., Inc., St. Louis, MO). Two insertions of one and three residues in SHH-C were modeled using a classical loop search procedure as already described (38Bissantz C. Bernard P. Hibert M. Rognan D. Proteins. 2003; 50: 5-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), whereas a 19-residue insertion could not be modeled. Standard geometries for the mutated side chains were given by the BIOPOLYMER module of SYBYL. Whenever possible, the side-chain torsional angles were kept to the values occurring in the x-ray templates. Otherwise, a short scanning of side chain angles was performed to remove steric clashes between the mutated side chain and the other amino acids. After the heavy atoms were modeled, all hydrogen atoms were added, and the protein coordinates were then minimized with AMBER (39Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, D.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Radmer R.J. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Amber, 6 Ed.

Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; : 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). The minimizations were carried out by 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by conjugate gradient minimization until the root-mean-square gradient of the potential energy was less than 0.05 kcal/mol·Å. A twin cut-off (10.0, 15.0 Å) was used to calculate non-bonded electrostatic interactions at every minimization step, and the non-bonded pair-list was updated every 25 steps. A distance-dependent (ϵ = 4r) dielectric function was used. Site-directed Mutagenesis—To mutate SHH amino acids, the full-length cDNA encoding the human wild-type (WT) SHH (GenBank™ accession number L38518), kindly provided by Dr. C. Tabin (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), was used. Mutations G31R, W117G, W117R, H140P, T150R, C183F, D222N, A226T, L271P, I354T, and A383T were introduced into SHH cDNA using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with primers that are available upon request. The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis using the BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA) and the ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer. The WT and mutated SHH cDNAs were subcloned into the pRK5 vector for use in transfection experiments. Cell Culture—HEK293 and C3H10T1/2 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Transfection, Expression in Cell Cultures and Conditioned Media— HEK293 cells (107/well) were electrotransfected (270 V, 960 microfarads; Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) in buffer (K2HPO4, 50 mm; KCH3CO2, 20 mm; KOH, 20 mm; MgSO4, 26.6 mm; pH 7.4) with 1.5 μg of WT or mutated SHH cDNAs. The DNA amount was normalized to 10 μg with the empty vector. 48 h after transfection, the culture media were harvested, and the cells were rinsed and scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and both were centrifuged (4 °C, 100 × g, 10 min) and processed for Western blotting. Alternatively, the culture media were harvested, centrifuged (4 °C, 500 × g, 10 min), and used as conditioned media to evaluate the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Western Blotting and Densitometry Analysis—48 h after the transfection, cell pellets were homogenized in ice-cold 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, aprotinin (10 μ g/ml), leupeptin (10 μ g/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μ g/ml), and benzamidine (60 μg/ml), and protein content was determined (41Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Media and cellular homogenates were separated on 12.5% acrylamide gel, blotted on nitrocellulose membrane, probed 2 h with specific polyclonal antisera 167Ab (1/1000) directed to mouse Shh-N (42Traiffort E. Moya K.L. Faure H. Hassig R. Ruat M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 839-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 1229Ab (1/1000) directed to the human SHH-C peptide 288-302 and kindly provided by A. Galdes and K. P. Williams (Biogen, Cambridge, MA). Immunoreactivity was revealed as described (42Traiffort E. Moya K.L. Faure H. Hassig R. Ruat M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 839-850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effective quantity of loaded protein was determined by probing the blots with a 1/500 dilution of the mouse monoclonal IgG2a α-actin antibody (AC-40) (Sigma). Quantification of the chemiluminescent signals was performed by scanning the film with a Canon scanner (Canoscan 300, Canon, Courbevoie, France) and measuring the pixel densities in the signal areas using SigmaGel™ (Version 1.0, SPSS Inc.). Significance was assayed using the Excel 98 Student's t test (Microsoft®, Seattle, WA). Data were from at least three independent experiments carried out with different preparations of DNA. Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) Assay—C3H10T1/2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well. 24 h later, the culture medium was replaced by 200 μl of conditioned media from HEK293 cells as described above. Five days later, AP assay was performed as described (22Coulombe J. Traiffort E. Loulier K. Faure H. Ruat M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 25: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Data are the means ± S.E. of quadruplicates, and experiments have been performed 3–5 times with similar results. Significance was assayed by the Excel 98 Student's t test (Microsoft®). Mapping SHH-N and SHH-C Mutations Associated with HPE—During the last few years genetic studies have associated non-syndromic HPE with about 40 missense SHH mutations, one nucleotide insertion, seven nucleotide deletions, and nine mutations introducing a stop codon leading to a premature SHH protein (Fig. 1 and Table I). These genetic modifications affect residues located in the signal peptide as well as in SHH-N and SHH-C. They are reported in Table I together with the expected effect at the level of the SHH protein and the clinical signs seen in the HPE-affected cases and in the kindred.Table IComparison of genetic and functional traits linked to SHH mutations associated with HPE For cDNA numbering (c.), +1 corresponds to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon, and for protein numbering (p.), +1 corresponds to the initiator codon.

To investigate whether this microtubule-induced NE deformation is sufficient for NE breakdown, we assess the mechanical resilience of a reconstituted lamin B1 network. Quantitative rheological methods demonstrate that human lamin B1 filaments form stiff networks that can resist much greater deformations than those caused by microtubules impinging on the NE.

These results demonstrate that both mechanical tearing of the lamina and biochemical modification of lamin B1 filaments are required for NE breakdown. The nuclear lamina is a filamentous meshwork underlying the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (NE) 1The abbreviations used are: NE, nuclear envelope; IF, intermediate filament; F-actin, filamentous actin.1The abbreviations used are: NE, nuclear envelope; IF, intermediate filament; F-actin, filamentous actin. (1Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The primary components of the nuclear lamina are intermediate filament (IF) lamins and in particular lamin B1, which is constitutively expressed (2Hoger T.H. Zatloukal K. Waizenegger I. Krohne G. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1990; 100: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 3Zewe M. Hoger T.H. Fink T. Lichter P. Krohne G. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 342-350PubMed Google Scholar). Human lamin B1 mutated by deletion of the rod domain (B1Δrod) causes severe alteration of the nuclear lamina organization (4Foisner R. Gerace L.

Wilson K.L. Harel A. Goldberg M. Cohen M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Lamins and many other NE proteins are subject to mitotic phosphorylation by the Cdc2 kinase, which diminishes protein-protein interactions required for NE integrity, dispersing structural proteins into the cytoplasm at mitosis (8Ward G.E. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In particular, a lamin B1 mutant lacking the Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site prevents NE breakdown (9Heald R. McKeon F. Cell. 1990; 61: 579-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 10Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which suggests that lamin phosphorylation is a prerequisite for NE destabilization before mitosis (12Buendia B. Courvalin J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 230: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is growing evidence in vitro and in vivo that lamin B1 disassembly is independent of NE breakdown. Lamin B1 solubilization in vitro has been shown to occur without NE breakdown (13Newport J. Spann T. Cell. 1987; 48: 219-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Time-resolved fluorescence microscopy reveals that the organization of green fluorescent proteinlamins in the NE of live cells remains intact until NE breakdown and little soluble lamin (<5%) can be detected through fluorescence after recovery before NE breakdown (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Instead, early spindle microtubules cause folds in the NE, which develop into deep invaginations that create an initial hole in the NE (15Georgatos S.D. Pyrpasopoulou A. Theodoropoulos P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2129-2140PubMed Google Scholar). This hole forms at a specific NE position, which is distal from the centrosomes (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The non-random position of the hole on the NE surface argues against weakening of the lamina by lamin disassembly prior to NE breakdown, which would create randomly located holes wherever lamin is completely disassembled (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been speculated that mechanical tearing generated by microtubules play the main role in NE breakdown (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the microtubule-induced deformation is sufficient for NE breakdown, we assess the viscoelastic properties of lamin B1 to determine the mechanical resilience of a reconstituted lamin B1 network. We focus on lamin B1 because it is the primary component of the NE prior to its breakdown in the G2/M transition whereas lamin A/C is dissociated from the NE (15Georgatos S.D. Pyrpasopoulou A. Theodoropoulos P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2129-2140PubMed Google Scholar). We use quantitative rheological methods to examine the mechanical response of lamin B1 networks subject to shear and axial deformations similar to those generated by premitotic microtubules. To provide a basis of comparison, we report the mechanical properties of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments vimentin, complex epithelia keratin K5–K14, and simple epithelia keratin K8–K18, as well as F-actin. Our results show that lamin B1 can (even in the absence of auxiliary proteins) form exceptionally resilient structures through strong interfilament interactions. The maximum deformation of the NE generated by early spindle microtubules is much lower than the deformation required to breakdown a lamin B1 network, which suggests that NE breakdown has to involve both mechanical tearing of the lamina and biochemical modifications of lamin filaments. Lamin B1 Purification and Assembly—Unless specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company. Purification of human lamin B1 is based on published protocols (5Schirmer E.C. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 16Karabinos A. Schunemann J. Meyer M. Aebi U. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21/DE3 containing a human lamin B1 expression plasmid was grown at 37 °C in 200 ml of SOB medium (20 g of Tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 0.5 g of NaCl, 0.186 g of KCl, and 20 mm MgCl2 per liter H2O) supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Human lamin B1 cDNA was a generous gift from E. C. Schirmer (The Scripps Research Institute). Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at A595 0.7 for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline with 1.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitor. After a 7-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the pellet was washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 8 m urea, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. The solution was then incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) for 45 min and eluted in fractions with the same buffer containing a 0–200 mm imidazole gradient. The eluate was dialyzed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride and was applied to a Mono Q column (Bio-Rad) eluted with NaCl gradient from 0–1 M. The lamin-rich fraction was examined by SDS-PAGE and further dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride for storage. The protein purity was verified to be >99% by SDS-PAGE assay followed by densitometry. For filament assembly, lamin in 8 m urea at 1 mg/ml was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (5Schirmer E.C. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for 16 h at 4 °C. 150 mm NaCl was added to the solution to induce lamin assembly. Alternatively, dialysis in steps (which is for instance required for keratin (17Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)) did not affect the structural and mechanical outcomes of lamin B1 networks (data not shown). Actin and Vimentin Purification and Assembly—Actin was prepared from chicken breast (18MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with an extra step of gel filtration by Sephacryl S-300 (Sigma) (19Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Purified actin was stored as Ca2+-actin in continuous dialysis at 4 °C against buffer G (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm sodium azide, and 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Mg2+-actin filaments were generated by adding 0.1 volume of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) polymerizing salt to 0.9 volume of G-actin in buffer G. The purification of human vimentin is based on a published protocol (20Moir R.D. Donaldson A.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 363-372PubMed Google Scholar) using a Mono Q column (Bio-Rad). Human vimentin cDNA was a generous gift from R. D. Goldman (Northwestern University Medical School). To form filaments, vimentin that was solubilized in 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, was dialyzed into filament buffer (0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 160 mm NaCl, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at 37 °C (21Herrmann H. Haner M. Brettel M. Muller S.A. Goldie K.N. Fedtke B. Lustig A. Franke W.W. Aebi U. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 933-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Rheology—The mechanical properties of lamin B1 networks were evaluated using a strain-controlled, cone-and-plate rheometer (ARES-100, TA Instruments, Piscataway, NJ) (19Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Shear deformations of controlled amplitude and frequency were applied via precise dynamic rotations of the lower plate; the stress induced within the network was measured through a sensitive torque transducer connected to the upper cone. Lamin B1 solutions were supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and immediately loaded in the space between the cone and plate. Once the cone was set into position, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine dissolved in chloroform was applied to the air-water interface to eliminate the interfacial localization of lamins (17Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The dead time is estimated to be 5 min before rheological measurements. Gelation was monitored by measuring the time-dependent elasticity of the network. Elasticity was measured by applying two oscillatory deformations of 1% amplitude at a frequency of 1 rad/sec every 30 s until a steady state was attained (∼1–3 h). At steady state, the frequency-dependent viscoelastic moduli of the networks, G′(ω) and G″(ω), were computed by dividing the inphase and out-of-phase components of the measured oscillatory stress induced within the network by the applied strain amplitude (here 1%) (19Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The viscoelastic nature (i.e. viscous versus elastic) of lamin networks was characterized by the phase angle δ = tan–1(G″/G′). The response of the lamin networks to shear was assayed by applying oscillatory deformations at 1 rad/s and amplitudes from 0.5 to 500%. For all rheological experiments, the temperature of the solutions was maintained at 25 °C to within 0.1 °C. Mechanical Properties of Reconstituted Lamin B1 Networks—We tested the mechanical properties of human lamin B1 networks in assembly buffer using quantitative rheological methods as a function of time after onset of assembly and at steady state. Suspensions of lamin B1 (Fig. 1A) were allowed to gel in the space between the cone and plate of the rheometer, and elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G″) of the suspensions were probed by 1% oscillatory deformations. The elastic modulus and viscous modulus represent the in-phase and out-of-phase components of the stress induced in the networks normalized by the amplitude of the applied deformation (23Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley and Sons, New York1980Google Scholar, 24Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To monitor gelation kinetics, networks were subject to a couple of oscillatory deformations of small 1% amplitude every 30 s until the elasticity of the network reached a steady state value (the first 2 h are shown in Fig. 1B). The elastic modulus of the network dominated rapidly (∼5 min) the viscous modulus of the network, an effect measured by the low phase angle δ = tan–1(G″/G′)∼10° of the network. The phase angle of a material characterizes its viscoelastic nature (24Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar): e.g. δ = 90° for water or glycerol, which from a rheological point of view corresponds to a liquid-like behavior, and δ∼0° for a very stiff rubber corresponding to a solid-like behavior. Therefore, rheometry reveals that lamin B1 networks display a pronounced solid-like character. The rate of gelation, estimated here as the inverse of the time required for attaining 90% of the steady state value (Fig. 1B), increased slightly from 0.05 min–1 to 0.125 min–1 for lamin B1 concentrations between 1 and 6 mg/ml. Over that concentration range, the elasticity of lamin B1 networks increased ∼15-fold (Fig. 1B). By subjecting lamin B1 networks to small oscillatory deformations of frequencies between ω = 0.01 and 100 rad/s, we measured the dynamic elasticity, G′(ω), and viscous modulus, G″(ω), of lamin B1 networks (Fig. 1C). The frequency dependence of G′(ω) was weak (Fig. 1C), which signifies that for the tested lamin concentrations lamin B1 polymers in solution showed little or no mobility for time scales as long as 2π/ω ∼ 600s (Fig. 1C). These results show that (from a rheological point of view) lamin networks behave as cross-linked gels. Lamin B1 Networks Strain-harden under Shear—Up to 1 h prior to NE breakdown, the interphase nucleus is subject to large intracellular mechanical stresses: the NE experiences localized folds and deep invaginations caused by early spindle microtubules before the disassembly of lamin B1 filaments, which occurs only after NE breakdown (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 15Georgatos S.D. Pyrpasopoulou A. Theodoropoulos P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2129-2140PubMed Google Scholar). To test the response of lamin B1 to mechanical stresses such as those created by premitotic microtubules, lamin B1 networks were subject to deformations of fixed frequency of 1 rad/s and amplitude ranging between 0.5 and 500%. Profiles of the strain-dependent elasticity of lamin B1 networks, G′(γ0), featured three distinct regions (Fig. 2A). G′(γ0) was mostly independent of γ0 at low deformation amplitudes, increased dramatically at intermediate strain amplitudes (i.e. the network strain-hardens under shear), and declined rapidly at large strain deformations (i.e. the network strain-softens under shear) (Fig. 2A and inset). The maximum value reached by G′(γ0) relative to the base line increased greatly with lamin B1 concentration (Fig. 2, B and C). Hence, lamin B1 networks show pronounced strain-hardening, whereby the network stiffens under shear. To further investigate the effect of shear deformations on lamin B1 networks, oscillatory deformations of the type γ(t) = γ0sinωt of fixed frequency (ω = 1 rad/sec) and increasing deformation amplitude γ0 were applied to the networks, and the resulting induced stress σ(t) was monitored as a function of time (Fig. 3A). Up to a strain amplitude of ∼20%, σ(t) was a periodic function (Fig. 3A). However, past that threshold strain amplitude, σ(t) became a non-periodic function with a maximum stress that declined from one shear cycle to the next (Fig. 3C). For small deformations, lissajous figures of σ(t) versus γ(t) displayed a narrow ellipse (Fig. 3B), which indicates that little viscous dissipation within the network occurred during shear (i.e. the network is much more elastic than viscous). For large deformation amplitudes, lissajous figures displayed a wide ellipse (Fig. 3D) with a major axis slightly rotating clockwise because the network softened during the shear cycles. This figure shows that the stress increased faster than linearly with the strain (arrow in Fig. 3D), another hallmark of shear-induced hardening in lamin networks (25Ma L. Xu J. Coulombe P.A. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19145-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Lamin Displays Exceptional Resilience against Mechanical Stresses—Next, we investigated the intrinsic mechanical resilience of lamin, i.e. the largest deformation that lamin can sustain before its ultimate breakdown. The resilience of lamin B1 networks, i.e. the strain amplitude at which G′ began to decrease, was extraordinarily high (γ0∼200%) and mostly independent of concentration (Fig. 4). In contrast, our analysis of images of nuclei undergoing large deformations in premitotic cells reported in Ref. 14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar shows that the relative shear deformation of the NE created by spindle microtubules does not exceed 13% (see analysis in supplemental material). This is because the seemingly large, micron-scale deformations of the NE occur over the thin (∼50–100 nm) lamina thickness. Note that the NE is subject to both shear and axial (i.e. extensional) deformations. We computed a maximum axial resilience between 133 and 200% (see supplemental material) whereas the relative axial deformation of the NE in vivo was reported to be ∼50% (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Hence, the (axial or shear) deformations that the lamin network can sustain before breakdown are much larger than deformations caused by microtubules prior to NE breakdown. Lamin B1 networks are somewhat less elastic but are significantly more solid-like and more resilient than F-actin networks (Fig. 5, A–D). Lamin B1 displays much more pronounced strain-induced hardening than any other network of major cytoskeleton polymer (Fig. 5C). Besides strain-hardening, lamin B1 networks display mechanical properties (elasticity, phase angle, etc.) that are quite similar to those of networks of simple-epithelial keratin K8–K18, complex-epithelial keratin K5–K14, and vimentin (Fig. 5, A–D), all cytoplasmic intermediate filaments with well established structural function (17Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Janmey P.A. Euteneuer U. Traub P. Schliwa M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 27Rogers K.R. Eckelt A. Nimmrich V. Janssen K.P. Schliwa M. Herrmann H. Franke W.W. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 136-150PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether mechanical tearing of the NE by spindle microtubules impinging on the nucleus is the sole mechanism required for NE breakdown, we assessed the viscoelastic properties of lamin B1, the primary component of NE lamina. Using quantitative rheological methods, we measured the mechanical properties of lamin B1 networks subject to different types of shear stresses at broad range. Lamin B1 polymers form remarkably solid-like and resilient structures. Under tension, lamin B1 networks display a pronounced strain-hardening behavior whereby the elasticity of the network increased under shear. The maximum shear that lamin B1 can sustain before breakdown is significantly greater than the deformation caused by spindle microtubules impinging on the NE in prophase. Therefore, mechanical tearing of the lamin B1-rich lamina is necessary but not sufficient to induce NE breakdown. Concentration Dependence of Network Elasticity—Over the range of concentrations in lamin B1 probed here, the increase in elasticity is compatible with a power law of the type G′(c)∼c1.4, where c is the concentration in lamin B1. A similar concentration dependence of G′ is observed for the stereotypical semiflexible cytoskeleton polymer F-actin (28Palmer A. Xu J. Kuo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Polymer physics theory predicts that the elastic modulus of networks of semiflexible polymers should scale as G′(c)∼c1.4, whereas rigid polymers should scale as G′(c)∼c1 and flexible polymers should scale as G′(c)∼c2.25 (29Morse D.C. Macromolecules. 1998; 31: 7044-7067Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thus, our rheological data suggest that lamin B1 polymers in solution are semiflexible polymers, i.e. their persistence length (which measures the bending rigidity of the polymer) is of the same order of magnitude as their contour length, which also is the case of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments (30Mucke N. Kreplak L. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Herrmann H. Aebi U. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Fudge D.S. Gardner K.H. Forsyth V.T. Riekel C. Gosline J.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2015-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Compounding the effect of interfilaments interactions, this putative rigidity would provide lamin B1 with a supplemental mechanism to entangle easily and therefore form stiff gels (32Panorchan P. Wirtz D. Tseng Y. Phys. Rev. E. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 33Heidemann S.R. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 160-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Lamin B1 networks stiffen under shear stress, i.e. they readily display strain-hardening, which potentially stems from the self-interactions that are also responsible for their solid-like character and extraordinary resilience against shear deformations. Under large shear deformations, lamin B1 filaments would be forced to bend while pushing against the topological constraints created by entanglements with other filaments, an effect that is energetically unfavorable. If nonsteric interactions were absent, lamin B1 filaments would be able to relax the stress by sliding past one another. Here, for lamin B1 networks, these non-steric interactions impede such sliding motion, which prevents stress relaxation and induces strain-hardening as well as enhanced mechanical resilience. Similarly to actin networks, the presence of other components in the prophase lamina, such as LAP2β and POM121 (which associate with lamin B1 (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar)), could further increase the resilience and strain-hardening of lamin B1 meshwork. Microtubule-driven Deformation Force Alone Is Insufficient to Break Down Lamin Network—Unlike the two major cytoskeletal polymers F-actin and microtubule (34Sato M. Schwartz W.H. Selden S.C. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), lamin B1 has a natural tendency to generate inter-filament interactions and form bundles even in the absence of auxiliary proteins (1Aebi U. Cohn J. Buhle L. Gerace L. Nature. 1986; 323: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 13Newport J. Spann T.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1179-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These non-steric interactions promote the formation of large condensed microstructures and bundles and endow lamin B1 polymers with a propensity to form elastic gels. The stiffness and relative magnitude of elastic and viscous moduli of lamin B1 filament suspensions are conspicuously similar to those obtained with reconstituted networks of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, including vimentin, complex epithelial keratin K4-K14, and simple epithelial keratin K8-K18 (17Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 39Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The strong solid-like character of IF networks, not shared by the two other major cytoskeleton polymers, originates from strong non-steric interactions between polymers (24Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O. Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This characteristic allows lamin B1 networks to possess extraordinary shear resilience, exceeding that of microtubule and F-actin networks. We recently measured the micro-mechanical properties of the interphase nucleus in vivo (40Tseng Y. Lee J.S. Kole T.P. Jiang I. Wirtz D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2159-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These measurements show an intranuclear elastic modulus that is much higher than the viscous modulus, and an elasticity similar to that observed here with reconstituted lamin B1 networks. When spindle microtubules impinge on the NE, the NE is subject to both shear and axial deformations. One can easily compute the axial resilience from the measured shear resilience. If we assume plane stress conditions and a linear isotropic brittle material we may relate the extensional deformation at failure, ϵu, to the shear deformation at failure, γu, by the Poisson's ratio, ν, of the material, ϵu = γu/(1+ν) (see supplemental material). Although ν is generally regarded to be ∼0.3 for gels and polymer networks, we may bound it between an incompressible material (ν = 0.5) and a perfectly compressible material (ν = 0) to conclude that 2/3γu ≤ ϵu ≤ γu, or 133% < ϵu <200%. Thus the maximum axial deformation of lamina before breakdown is much larger than that of the NE before break-down observed in vivo, ∼50% (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The Exceptional Mechanical Resilience of Lamin Imposes the Existence of a Crucial Biochemical Step before NE Break-down—The low elastic modulus of lamin B1 will allow relatively large deformations of the lamina created by spindle microtubules as observed in vivo, but the extremely high resilience of lamin B1will prevent its collapse. It might be the 42-residue insert within the lamin rod domain that makes the lamin filament networks mechanically tougher than cytoplasmic IF networks (39Ma L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Coulombe P.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a hypothesis that we shall test in the future. The high resilience of lamin networks stems from both the high resistance of lamin against longitudinal deformation (30Mucke N. Kreplak L. Kirmse R. Wedig T. Herrmann H. Aebi U. Langowski J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 31Fudge D.S. Gardner K.H. Forsyth V.T. Riekel C. Gosline J.M. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2015-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) as well as the propensity of lamin filaments to cross-link, a property shared to a lesser extent by other intermediate filaments. The maximum deformation that a lamin B1 network can sustain before breakdown is much greater than the deformations generated by spindle microtubules impinging on the NE. These results together with the fact that lamin B1 depolymerizes only after NE breakdown suggest that NE break-down by mechanical tearing of the lamina cannot occur until the lamin B1 network is weakened by biochemical modification. Reduction of the homotypic affinity between lamin B1 filaments would greatly diminish the mechanical resilience of the lamina but would not necessarily affect lamin dynamics, solubility, and apparent organization. Therefore, it would not be detected by changes in fluorescence after recovery or total fluorescence intensity (14Beaudouin J. Gerlich D. Daigle N. Eils R. Ellenberg J. Cell. 2002; 108: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The reduction of lamin interfilament interactions before NE breakdown could be achieved by premitotic phosphorylation of lamin B1 or by regulatory proteins that are yet to be identified. The lamina contains many more components besides lamin B1, including nuclear actin and protein 4.1 (41Krauss S.W. Chen C. Penman S. Heald R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10752-10757Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which form filamentous structures that could further enhance the resilience of lamina. We thank Dr. E. C.

It is also critical for cell polarization in many other contexts throughout the Metazoa. The Par6 protein contains a PDZ domain and a partial CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which mediate interactions with other polarity proteins such as Par3, Cdc42, Pals1, and Lgl. A family of mammalian Par6 isoforms (Par6A–D) has been described, but the significance of this diversification has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that Par6 family members localize differently when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells and have distinct effects on tight junction (TJ) assembly. Par6B localizes to the cytosol and inhibits TJ formation, but Par6A co-localizes predominantly with the TJ marker ZO-1 at cell-cell contacts and does not affect junctions. These functional differences correlate with differences in Pals1 binding; Par6B interacts strongly with Pals1, whereas Par6A binds weakly to Pals1 even in the presence of active Cdc42. Pals1 has a low affinity for the isolated CRIB-PDZ domain of Par6A, but analysis of chimeras showed that in addition Pals1 binding is blocked by an inhibitory property of the N terminus of Par6A. Unexpectedly, the localization of Par6A to cell-cell contacts is Cdc42-independent. PAR-6 is essential for asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote.

Unexpectedly, the localization of Par6A to cell-cell contacts is Cdc42-independent. PAR-6 was first identified as one of six Par proteins that are essential for asymmetric division of the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote (1Watts J.L. Etemad-Moghadam B. Guo S. Boyd L. Draper B.W.

It co-localizes with another Par protein, PAR-3, and the atypical protein kinase C, PKC-3, 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; TJ, tight junction; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; mLgl, mammalian lethal giant larvae; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1; aPKC, atypical PKC.1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; TJ, tight junction; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; mLgl, mammalian lethal giant larvae; PDZ, PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1; aPKC, atypical PKC. at the anterior cortex of the nematode zygote. These proteins show a genetic co-dependence, such that the loss of any one of them disrupts the polarized localization of the others (2Hung T.J. Kemphues K.J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian Par6 binds directly to mammalian Par3 and aPKC, as well as to the small GTPase Cdc42, to form a quaternary complex (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 4Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This complex has been implicated in the formation of tight junctions in mammalian epithelial cells (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1183-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Par6 is also required for the polarization of neuroblasts and ectodermal cells in the Drosophila embryo (7Petronczki M. Knoblich J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), for axon specification in hippocampal neurons (8Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and in the orientation of migrating astrocytes (9Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells display apical-basal polarity, and the apical surface is segregated from the basolateral membranes by a barrier called the tight junction (TJ). The expression of dominant interfering fragments of Par3, Par6, or aPKC can all inhibit TJ assembly in MDCK cells (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Par6 contains a PDZ domain and a partial CRIB domain, both of which are required for binding to Par3 and Cdc42-GTP. The N terminus of Par6 interacts directly with the regulatory domain of PKCι/λ and PKCζ (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 4Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 10Qiu R.G. Abo A. Steven Martin G. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 697-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional binding partners for Par6 have been identified. One is Pals1, which is a component of a conserved polarity complex containing the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb), and Patj, a multi-PDZ domain protein (11Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 12Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This complex is also localized to TJs, as is the Par complex, and the overexpression of Crb (or of fragments of Pals1 or Patj) interferes with TJ assembly. Par6 interacts directly with the N terminus of Pals1 through the CRIB-PDZ region, and importantly, this interaction is regulated by Cdc42 (12Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Another binding partner is Lgl, which is also involved in cell polarization. Lgl interacts directly with Par6 and can be phosphorylated by aPKC (13Plant P.J. Fawcett J.P. Lin D.C. Holdorf A.D. Binns K. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 14Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, Par3, Pals1, and Lgl are physically linked through Par6 to signaling pathways that converge on the Cdc42 GTPase. Whereas only one par-6 gene exists in Drosophila and C. elegans, a family of four is present in mammals, designated as Par6A–D (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) (although no full-length clone of Par6D has yet been identified). However, the significance of this diversification has been unclear. We now demonstrate that Par6 isoforms A–C localize differently when expressed in MDCK epithelial cells and have distinct effects on TJ formation. These functional differences correlate with differences in Pals1 binding, suggesting that Par6 family members have distinct functions in mammalian cells, which are mediated by differential targeting and effector interactions. Cell Culture and Processing—MDCK II and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% Hyclone fetal bovine serum (5% fetal bovine serum, 5% calf serum for COS-7) plus 1 mm sodium pyruvate and penicillin/streptomycin. MDCK cells were transiently transfected with different constructs using Effectene (Qiagen) or electroporation (Amaxa). COS-7 cell transfections, immunoprecipitations, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays were performed as described previously (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 16Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The MDCK cell lines stably expressing Myc-Par6B-(102–371) have been described before (5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Images were collected using a Nikon TE200 wide field microscope or a Zeiss Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope. Primary antibodies were monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 (1/500), monoclonal anti-HA 12CA5 (1/500), polyclonal anti-ZO-1 (1/500), monoclonal anti-occludin (1/500), polyclonal anti-claudin-1 (1/50) (all from Zymed Laboratories Inc.), polyclonal anti-Par3 (1/100), and polyclonal anti-Pals1 (1/50). The Par3 and Pals1 antibodies were produced in rabbits against recombinant proteins (Cocalico Biologicals). Secondary antibodies were coupled to Alexa Fluor 594 or 488 (Molecular Probes). Calcium switch and transepithelial resistance measurements were performed as previously described (5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Gumbiner B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). DNA Constructs—Par6A, -B, and -C constructs were described previously (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants and chimeras of Par6 were generated by PCR. Single amino acid mutations were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). In Vitro Binding Assays—Purified GST-Pals1-(1–181) or GST alone (2 μg each) was bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with in vitro translated 35S-labeled Par6 proteins (TnT-coupled wheat germ system, Promega). Wheat germ lysates were used because plants do not possess Par gene homologues, so the in vitro translated proteins are unlikely to bind to bridging proteins or to other factors in the incubation mix. After washing, bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. The reasons for the diversification of the Par6 family in vertebrates have not been understood. Therefore, to address this issue, we compared the subcellular distribution and biochemical properties of the mammalian Par6 isoforms. Unexpectedly, HA3-tagged Par6A, -B, and -C did not give identical staining patterns when expressed in MDCK epithelial cells. (Par6D was not examined because no full-length cDNA has yet been identified.) Par6A co-localized predominantly with the tight junction marker ZO-1 at cell-cell contacts, whereas Par6B was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and disrupted ZO-1 localization (Fig. 1, A and B), as previously described (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Par6C partially localized to cell-cell contacts and, like Par6A, had no effect on ZO-1 localization (Fig. 1A). Replacement of the HA tag with Myc or other tags did not alter localization patterns (data not shown). Expression of Par6B has been found to inhibit the assembly of many TJ components, including the transmembrane proteins occludin and claudin-1 (5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further determine the effect of Par6A on TJ structure, we examined occludin, claudin-1, and two peripheral components, Par3 and Pals1. As shown in Fig. 1C, the junctional associations of these proteins were all unaffected by Par6A expression. We surmised that these isoform differences might reflect differences in the interactions with known Par6 binding partners. However, all three isoforms bound with similar efficiencies to Par3, mLgl1/2, and PKCζ (Fig. 1D), but although both Par6B and Par6C showed strong interactions with Pals1 in the presence of a constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42L61 mutant), Par6A bound weakly to Pals1 (Fig. 1E). A more subtle difference was also apparent between the B and C isoforms, because although Cdc42-GTP enhanced the binding of both Par6B and -C to Pals1, Par6B exhibited stronger basal binding in the presence of an inactive Cdc42 mutant (Cdc42N17). Pals1 localizes at TJs and is important for TJ assembly (12Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 17Straight S.W. Shin K. Fogg V.C. Fan S. Liu C.J. Roh M. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that Par6B inhibits TJ formation by sequestering Pals1 away from cell-cell contacts. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HA3-Pals1 into control MDCK cells or MDCK cells stably expressing Myc-tagged Par6B-(102–371) (ΔNPar6B). Cells were subjected to a calcium switch and TJ re-assembly was monitored. We have shown previously that ΔNPar6B interacts with Pals1 and that it delays the reassembly of TJs after calcium depletion (5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Pals1 increased the peak of transepithelial resistance in control cells (Fig. 2A), which was consistent both with the idea that Pals1 plays an important role in TJ formation and with the observation that loss of Pals1 in MDCK cells reduces the transepithelial resistance (17Straight S.W. Shin K. Fogg V.C. Fan S. Liu C.J. Roh M. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When expressed in ΔNPar6B cells, Pals1 partially rescued the delay (caused by ΔNPar6B) in assembly of TJs after calcium re-addition. This was shown by improved transepithelial resistance development (Fig. 2A) and by a more uniform association of ZO-1 with cell-cell junctions (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar results were obtained using transient co-transfection of Par6B and Pals1 (not shown). These data indicate that the inhibition of TJ assembly by Par6B is mediated at least partially through sequestration of Pals1. Because Par6A and B exhibit distinct properties in cellular localization and Pals1 binding, we focused on these two isoforms. The Par6 family contains a highly conserved CRIB and PDZ domain, but the N and C termini differ considerably (3Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). To determine which region of Par6 is responsible for the differential binding to Pals1, we made several Par6A/B chimeras (Fig. 3A) and tested their ability to interact with Pals1 in an in vitro binding assay. GST alone or GST-Pals1-(1–181), the region necessary and sufficient to bind Par6B, was attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with in vitro translated, 35S-labeled Par6A/B chimera proteins. Interestingly, those proteins that contain the N terminus of Par6A (wild type Par6A, Par6A/B/A, Par6A/B/Δ, Par6A/B/B, and Par6A/A/B) were all unable to bind Pals1-(1–181). However, those chimeras that either contain the N terminus of Par6B (wild type Par6B, Par6B/B/A, and Par6B/A/A) or lack the N terminus of Par6A, such as Par6Δ/B/A, were competent to bind Pals1-(1–181) (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we conclude that the N terminus of Par6A blocks association with Pals1. Nonetheless, Par6B/A/A showed a much weaker interaction with Pals1 than the Par6B/B/A chimera. These two chimeras have the same N and C termini but different middle regions that contain CRIB and PDZ domains from Par6A and Par6B, respectively. This difference suggested that the middle region also contributes to the differential recognition of Pals1. To address this point, we first further characterized the interaction between Par6B and Pals1. This interaction is mediated by the N terminus of Pals1 and requires the PDZ domain of Par6B, because a mutation in the Par6B PDZ domain significantly reduces the binding to Pals1 (12Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the isolated PDZ domain of Par6B is both necessary and sufficient for interaction with Pals1. A partial deletion or mutation of the PDZ domain led to loss of binding to Pals1 (Fig. 3C). However, by in vivo immunoprecipitation, where we co-expressed a dominant active Cdc42 with different Par6B fragments, we found that the adjacent CRIB motif was essential for enhanced binding to Pals1 induced by Cdc42-GTP. Thus, binding of the Par6B-(126–253) fragment, which contains both the CRIB and PDZ domains, is enhanced by Cdc42-GTP (Fig. 3D), but the Par6B-(140–253) fragment, which contains only the PDZ domain and exhibited similar basal binding to Pals1, is not up-regulated by Cdc42. These results are consistent with the idea that Cdc42 binding induces a conformational change in Par6 that regulates effector binding (18Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Peterson F.C. Penkert R.R. Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we compared the binding of Pals1 to the CRIB-PDZ region of Par6A and Par6B. Pals1 had a very low affinity for the isolated CRIB-PDZ region of Par6A compared with that of Par6B (Fig. 3E). Thus, in addition to the inhibitory property of the N terminus of Par6A, the intrinsic low affinity of the Par6A CRIB-PDZ region for Pals1 further reduces the ability of Par6A to interact with Pals1. The CRIB-PDZ domains of Par6 are highly conserved. Only a small number of non-conserved residues are present in this region (Fig. 3F). Mutation of Cys-161 in Par6B to the corresponding residue Tyr in Par6A greatly reduced its interaction with Pals1 (Fig. 3G). However, the reciprocal Tyr to Cys mutation in Par6A failed to increase the binding to Pals1, suggesting that this Cys residue alone is not sufficient to confer the high affinity binding. We also tried to mutate other residues not conserved in Par6A but were unable to find any single amino acid mutation that could increase the binding of Par6A to Pals1. These data suggest that a limited number of residues within the CRIB-PDZ regions of the Par6 family regulates the specificity of interactions with its effectors. However, the rules that determine these interactions are complex and are not governed by single amino acid differences. Finally, we generated a Par6A mutant, Par6AΔPro, which is analogous to Par6BΔPro and does not bind to Cdc42-GTP (Fig. 4A). This mutant still localized efficiently to cell-cell contacts, indicating that the localization of Par6A is independent of Cdc42 (Fig. 4B). There are several notable aspects to the data presented above. First, although Pals1 is associated with tight junctions in epithelial cells and can bind to Par6B, it does not effectively recruit this Par6 isoform to the junctions. Second, even though Par6A binds more weakly to Pals1, it does co-localize with TJ proteins. Third, this localization of Par6A is independent of Cdc42, and fourth, the N-terminal domain of Par6A inhibits binding of Pals1 to the PDZ domain but does not affect the interactions with other binding partners such as mLgl, Par3, and aPKC. We note that there are some discrepancies in this study with data from other laboratories, because Yamanaka et al. (14Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) observed a weak interaction of Par6C (also called Par6α) with mLgl. However, Plant et al. (13Plant P.J. Fawcett J.P. Lin D.C. Holdorf A.D. Binns K. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) reported that, consistent with our data, Par6A–C family members could all interact efficiently with this downstream target. There is general agreement that Par3 binds to all three forms of Par6. Par3 and Lgl binding to Par6 is mutually exclusive, suggesting that these two effectors recognize similar or overlapping epitopes within the Par6 PDZ domain (14Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In contrast, Par3 and Pals1 can co-bind to Par6 (12Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), indicating that Pals1 interacts with a distinct surface on the Par6 PDZ domain. We have found that Lgl and Pals1 can also co-bind to Par6B in vitro, although it is not clear if these ternary interactions are of physiological relevance. 2C. T. Capaldo and I. G. Macara, unpublished observations. There are also recent reports that the Drosophila Par6 can bind directly to Patj (previously called Dlt) (20Nam S.C. Choi K.W. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4363-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which is a binding partner for Pals1, and that Par6C can bind directly to the C terminus of Crb3 (21Lemmers C. Michel D. Lane-Guermonprez L. Delgrossi M.H. Medina E. Arsanto J.P. Le Bivic A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which is also a binding partner for Pals1. However, we have been unable to detect any specific, high affinity association of Crb3 with Par6 isoforms (data not shown). Why does the overexpression of Par6B inhibit TJ assembly? The most likely answer is that it sequesters Pals1 away from the nascent junctions, thereby preventing their maturation. In support of this idea, the co-expression of Pals1 can partially rescue TJ assembly. The incompleteness of the rescue might be a result of insufficient expression of Pals1, or because other essential components of TJs are also affected by Par6B overexpression. The inability of Pals1 to recruit Par6B to junctions might reflect the fact that activated Cdc42 is required to stabilize this interaction. Although Cdc42-GTP appears transiently during junction assembly, there is little evidence that it is essential, and the expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42 does not block TJ formation (5Gao L. Joberty G. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our observation that the association of Par6A with the junctions is also independent of Cdc42 binding. Taken with the fact that all three Par6 isoforms can bind with similar efficiency to Par3, Lgl, and aPKCs, the results indicate that Par6A targeting to junctions involves another, currently unknown binding partner. Pals1 binding to Par6A is blocked by an inhibitory property of the N terminus. Presumably, this inhibition is independent of the ability of the N terminus to bind aPKCs, which is common to all forms of Par6. An attractive model is that the N terminus folds back and interacts with the CRIB-PDZ domain in all Par6 isoforms, but the Cdc42-GTP binding releases it from Par6B and -C, thereby exposing the Pals1 binding site, whereas in Par6A this self-interaction is too stable to be released. The isolated CRIB-PDZ domain of Par6A also has a reduced affinity for Pals1 as compared with Par6B despite the high sequence similarity between these two domains. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Cys-161 in Par6B contributes to Pals1 binding. However, we were unable to find any single residue that could confer high affinity Pals1 binding to the PDZ domain of Par6A. These data demonstrate that the Par6 family has evolved to interact differentially with the Pals1/Crb/Patj polarity complex and that at least one unknown, isoform-specific binding partner exists that targets Par6A to cell junctions.

In vertebrates, five Rad51 paralogs (Rad51B, Rad51C, Rad51D, XRCC2, and XRCC3) are expressed in mitotically growing cells and are thought to play mediating roles in homologous recombination, although their precise functions remain unclear. Among the five paralogs, Rad51C was found to be a central component present in two complexes, Rad51C-XRCC3 and Rad51B-Rad51C-Rad51D-XRCC2. We have shown previously that the human Rad51C protein exhibits three biochemical activities, including DNA binding, ATPase, and DNA duplex separation. Here we report the use of RNA interference to deplete expression of Rad51C protein in human HT1080 and HeLa cells. In HT1080 cells, depletion of Rad51C by small interfering RNA caused a significant reduction of frequency in homologous recombination. The level of XRCC3 protein was also sharply reduced in Rad51C-depleted HeLa cells, suggesting that XRCC3 is dependent for its stability upon heterodimerization with Rad51C. In addition, Rad51C-depleted HeLa cells showed hypersensitivity to the DNA-cross-linking agent mitomycin C and moderately increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Importantly, the radiosensitivity of Rad51C-deficient HeLa cells was evident in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle but not in G1 phase.

In terms of protein-protein interactions, Rad51C apparently has a central role, interacting directly with Rad51B, Rad51D, and XRCC3 and also weakly with Rad51 (23Schild D. Lio Y.-C. Collins D.W.

However, the functional significance of these complexes is not yet clear.Mutant studies provide a direct means for identifying the function of genes. A knock-out mutation of Rad51C was generated previously in DT40 chicken B-lymphocyte cells (25Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Tachiiri S. Fukushima T. Sonoda E. Schild D. Thompson L.H. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The mutant cells showed elevated spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, high sensitivity to killing by the cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC), mild sensitivity to γ-rays, and defective Rad51 nuclear focus formation after exposure to γ-rays. Similar phenotypes were also found in DT40 knockouts generated for the other four paralogs (25Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Tachiiri S. Fukushima T. Sonoda E. Schild D. Thompson L.H. Takeda S. Mol. Cell.

In addition, two hamster cell lines, irs3 and CL-V4B, have been identified as Rad51C mutants, and both were found to show reduced sister chromatid exchange and genomic instability (27French C.A.

However, how Rad51C functions in human cells has not yet been understood, and no Rad51C-mutant human cell line has been available.RNA interference (RNAi) has rapidly emerged as a powerful technique for investigating gene function (29Bass B.L.

These findings underscore the potential significance of the human Rad51C in the DNA strand exchange events of HR. Additionally, it was recently reported that Rad51C is required for Holliday junction processing in human extracts (39Liu Y. Masson J.-Y. Shah R. O'Regan P. West S.C. Science. 2004; 303: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), implying a role for Rad51C in the resolution of HR intermediates. Here we report the depletion of Rad51C expression in two human cell lines, a fibrosarcoma line, HT1080, and a cervical carcinoma line, HeLa, using 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes, and we directly examine the effect of Rad51C inhibition on HR using an in vivo HR assay. The effect of Rad51C depletion on the endogenous level of other Rad51 paralogs in HeLa cells was also examined. In addition, the sensitivity of Rad51C-depleted HeLa cells to MMC and ionizing radiation (IR) was characterized, and the dependence of radiosensitivity in Rad51C-deficient HeLa cells upon cell cycle phase was investigated using synchronized G1 and S + G2/M populations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRad51C siRNA Design—The siRNA duplexes were designed according to published procedures (36Elbashir S.M.

Both siRNA 1 and siRNA 2 are complementary 21-mers with a 2-base overhang and start at an AA dinucleotide in the mRNA. Selected sequences were subjected to BLAST analysis to rule out homology to other human mRNA sequences. The siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research and provided as purified and annealed duplexes (38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl Y.

The cells were maintained in a humidified 4.3% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Twenty-four h prior to transfection, cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 400,000 cells/well. For each well, 15 μl of siRNA stock oligonucleotide (20 μm) was diluted into 0.26 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). In a separate tube, 6 μl of Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted into 17 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The Oligofectamine dilution was added into the diluted siRNA duplex and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For control, cells were mock-transfected with Oligofectamine alone. Cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM, and 1.2 ml of Opti-MEM was subsequently added to each well. The Oligofectamine-siRNA complex was added dropwise to the cells and incubated at 37 °C. After 6 h, 0.75 ml of α-MEM supplemented with 30% fetal bovine serum was added to each well without removing the transfection mixture, and the cells were returned to incubation at 37 °C. Cells were harvested for assay of Rad51C expression by Western blotting analysis at 48, 72, and 96 h posttransfection.Antibodies—Rad51B and Rad51C antibodies were generated as described previously (24Lio Y.-C.

QM antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.Homologous Recombination Assays—Human HT1080-1885 cells were treated with siRNA transfection (or mock transfection) as described above. Two days after transfection, both sets of cells were trypsinized and individually seeded in a 6-well plate at 400,000 cells/well. The next day, each well was transfected with 1 μg of I-SceI expression vector pCMV(3×NLS)I-SceI and 4 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) or transfected with Superfect alone in serum-free α-MEM at a final volume of 1 ml. After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, the transfection mixture was removed; 3 ml of complete α-MEM was added into each well, and the cells were returned to incubation at 37 °C. Twenty-four h after I-SceI transfection, cells were replated in duplicate for puromycin selection at 120,000 cells/100-mm culture dish. Parallel platings for measurement of plating efficiency were made in duplicate at 250 cells/100-mm dish. On day 2 after transfection with I-SceI, selection cultures were refed with fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin. Cells were refed again with puromycin on days 6 and 10. Thirteen days after plating, cells were fixed and stained. The cultures for plating efficiency assay were incubated at 37 °C for 11 days without refeeding and then were fixed and stained. Colonies with 50 cells or more were counted.Mitomycin C and γ-Ray Survival Using Asynchronous Cells—Two days after siRNA transfection, HeLa cells were trypsinized and seeded at 1,000 cells/100-mm dish for each MMC dose to be tested. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were treated with graded concentrations (0–2 μm) of MMC for 1 h at 37 °C. The MMC-containing medium was then removed and replaced with 10 ml of complete α-MEM, and the cells were returned to incubation at 37 °C for colony formation. After 11 days, cell colonies were fixed and stained for counting. For γ-irradiation treatment, cells were seeded at 200–6,000 cells/T25 flask for each radiation dose to be tested. Cells were irradiated with a 137Cs γ-ray source at a dose rate of 1.50 Gy/min for various doses (0–10 Gy) at room temperature and then returned to incubation at 37 °C for colony formation. After 11 days, cell colonies were fixed and stained for counting.Cell Synchronization and Flow Cytometry—HeLa cells were synchronized in late G1 phase using the plant amino acid mimosine (40Lalande M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 41Watson P.A. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Flint A. Lalande M.

Cells were treated with 200 μm mimosine (Calbiochem) for 16 h. At the end of this period, the mimosine-containing medium was removed, and the cultures were washed three times with fresh medium. Cells were thus released from mimosine blockade and allowed to proceed through the cell cycle. The distribution of cells in the phases of the cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. At intervals after release from mimosine, cells were prepared by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of DNA (43Taylor I.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 1021-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Measurements of cell cycle distribution were performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using MODFIT software.γ-Ray Survival Using Synchronous Cells—HeLa cells were transfected with Rad51C siRNA (or mock transfection) as described above. Two days after transfection, both sets of cells were individually synchronized using mimosine treatment. The mock-transfected cultures were irradiated with various doses of γ-rays (0–10 Gy) at time point 0 or 7.5 h after release from mimosine, and the siRNA-transfected cultures were irradiated at 0 or 10 h after release from mimosine. After irradiation, cells were immediately trypsinized and replated in triplicate at 200–10,000 cells/T25 flask for each radiation dose to be tested. A parallel set of cells was returned to incubation at 37 °C and replated in triplicate for colony formation after an 18-h delay. After 11 days of incubation, cell colonies were fixed and stained for counting.RESULTSInhibition of Rad51C Reduces the Level of XRCC3 Protein and Other Rad51 Paralogs—To determine optimal conditions for depleting the expression of the Rad51C protein, nine different transfection condition sets with siRNA 1 were examined in HeLa cells, varied by siRNA concentration, seeded cell density, and presence or absence of serum. Western analysis was used to monitor the expression level of Rad51C after siRNA treatment. Among the nine condition sets tested, one condition set achieved about 90% inhibition of the endogenous level of the Rad51C protein in HeLa cells (data not shown). This condition was therefore used as our standard protocol for Rad51C depletion, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” for both HeLa and HT1080 human cells.It has been shown that Rad51C directly interacts with Rad51, Rad51B, Rad51D, and XRCC3, and together they form multiprotein complexes (18Masson J.-Y.

We examined the endogenous levels of Rad51 and the other four Rad51 paralogs in Rad51C siRNA-transfected HeLa cells on days 2, 3, and 4 posttransfection. As shown in Fig. 1A, the cellular level of Rad51C decreased on day 2 after siRNA treatment and remained very low through days 3 and 4. Both siRNA 1 and 2 caused a similar level and time course of inhibition, indicating that these two siRNA duplexes are almost equally effective for suppressing Rad51C expression. Concomitantly with Rad51C inhibition, XRCC3 protein level was also greatly reduced on days 2, 3, and 4 post-siRNA transfection. The result indicates that depletion of Rad51C destabilizes XRCC3, presumably because of decreased formation of the stabilizing Rad51C-XRCC3 heterodimer. When the expression levels of Rad51 and Rad51B were examined, it was found that the Rad51 level was low on day 2 but recovered by day 3. Similarly, the Rad51B level was reduced on day 3 but recovered by day 4. These observations suggest that the level of Rad51C present may dynamically affect the expression or stability of Rad51 and Rad51B as well as XRCC3. In contrast, the inhibition of Rad51C had a minimal effect on the level of Rad51D and XRCC2, indicating that Rad51C is not required for the stabilization of these two proteins. The entire experiment was carried out three times, and similar results were obtained. The Western data were quantified by densitometry, and statistical analysis for three independent experiments is shown in Fig. 1B. Mixed siRNA 1 and 2 were also used for transfection, and a similar pattern of Rad51 paralog levels was observed (data not shown). The marked dependence of XRCC3 upon Rad51C for its stability is important and means that other results described below may reflect depletion of Rad51C or XRCC3 or both (i.e. the Rad51C-XRCC3 heterodimer).Inhibition of Rad51C Results in a Reduced Frequency of Homologous Recombination—To measure HR, an artificial reporter locus (as diagrammed in Fig. 2A) was installed into a chromosome of human HT1080 cells by electroporation with a vector, pPGKpacIR-BSD, that carries the complete reporter locus. Clones of cells that integrated the reporter were isolated by selecting for a blasticidin resistance gene included on the vector, and the presence of a single integrated copy was confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown). The reporter locus comprises two defective Pac (puromycin acetyltransferase) genes configured as an inverted repeat. The left copy of the Pac gene has complete regulatory sequences (the murine phosphoglycerate kinase promoter/enhancer and the SV40 polyadenylation region) but is defective because of a mutation that deletes 80 base pairs of coding sequence and creates a cleavage site for the highly site-specific endonuclease I-SceI of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (44Rouet P.

The right copy of the Pac gene has an intact reading frame and a polyadenylation region but is defective because it lacks a promoter. A defined DNA double strand break can be introduced at the integrated reporter locus by transient expression of I-SceI. Cleavage by I-SceI creates a double strand break within the left Pac gene of the reporter locus. HR initiated from the break can convert the left Pac gene back to a wild-type sequence by using the right copy as a template. Frequency of HR is scored by counting puromycin-resistant colonies of cells. HT1080-1885 is a clonal isolate of HT1080 cells stably carrying the reporter and produces puromycin-resistant colonies at a frequency of ∼5 × 10-3/viable cell upon transient transfection for I-SceI expression (data not shown).Fig. 2Rad51C depletion results in a reduced frequency in homologous recombination in human HT1080 cells.A, homologous recombinational repair of a site-specific chromosomal break in the reporter locus.

HT1080-1885 cells were transfected with Rad51C siRNA 1 or siRNA 2 or mock-transfected with Oligofectamine alone (control). On day 2 post-siRNA transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting analysis with α-Rad51C and α-QM antibodies. C, siRNA depletion of Rad51C causes a reduction in HR frequency. On day 2 post-siRNA transfection, HT1080-1885 cells were transfected for expression of I-SceI endonuclease. Each transfection was replated in duplicate for HR frequency measurements. The HR frequency was calculated as the average number of colonies/dish divided by the plating efficiency for that transfection and divided by 120,000 (the total number of cells plated). The means and standard deviations for six experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Rad51C siRNA 1 and 2 were individually transfected into HT1080-1885 cells. Two days after siRNA transfection, the cells were transiently transfected for expression of I-SceI endonuclease. Twenty-four h after I-SceI transfection, a portion of the cells was subjected to Western analysis for Rad51C expression, and a portion was replated for HR assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, both siRNA 1 and 2 duplexes inhibited the expression of the Rad51C protein by about 70% in HT1080-1885 cells. Using the in vivo HR assay, we found that the frequency of HR was reduced about 2-fold in the Rad51C siRNA-treated cells by both siRNA duplexes, as compared with the mock-transfected controls (t test; siRNA 1, p = 0"

In Escherichia coli, inactivation of the gene (dtd) encoding this deacylase increases the toxicity of several d-amino acids including d-tyrosine, d-tryptophan, and d-aspartic acid. Here, we demonstrate that, in a Δdtd cell grown in the presence of 2.4 mm d-tyrosine, ∼40% of the total tRNATyr pool is converted into d-Tyr-tRNATyr. No d-Tyr-tRNATyr is observed in dtd+ cells. In addition, we observe that overproduction of tRNATyr, tRNATrp, or tRNAAsp protects a Δdtd mutant strain against the toxic effect of d-tyrosine, d-tryptophan, or d-aspartic acid, respectively. In the case of d-tyrosine, we show that the protection is accounted for by an increase in the concentration of l-Tyr-tRNATyr proportional to that of overproduced tRNATyr. Altogether, these results indicate that, by accumulating in vivo, high amounts of d-Tyr-tRNATyr cause a starvation for l-Tyr-tRNATyr. The deacylase prevents the starvation by hydrolyzing d-Tyr-tRNATyr. Overproduction of tRNATyr also relieves the starvation by increasing the amount of cellular l-Tyr-tRNATyr available for translation. d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase cleaves the ester bond between a tRNA molecule and a d-amino acid.

The deacylase prevents the starvation by hydrolyzing d-Tyr-tRNATyr. Overproduction of tRNATyr also relieves the starvation by increasing the amount of cellular l-Tyr-tRNATyr available for translation. d-amino acids found in the living world contribute to various functions (reviewed in Refs. 1Friedman M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999; 47: 3457-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar and 2Yang H. Zheng G. Peng X. Qiang B. Yuan J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the selectivity of ribosomal protein synthesis prevents their incorporation into polypeptides. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases ensure the first step of exclusion of d-amino acids. However, the stereospecificity of these enzymes is not absolute. Thus, it was observed early on that Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the formation of d-Tyr-tRNATyrin vitro (3Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 4Calendar R. Berg P. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). More recently, Saccharomyces cerevisiae tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (5Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as E. coli tryptophanyl- and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), were also shown to catalyze the transfer of the d-isomer of their cognate amino acid to the corresponding tRNA species in vitro. In all these cases, the catalytic efficiency with the d-enantiomer is measured only 15–2000-fold lower than that with the l-enantiomer. Soon after the discovery of the d-tyrosyl-tRNA synthesis by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, it was shown that extracts of E. coli and some other organisms contain an activity capable of hydrolyzing d-tyrosyl-tRNA into d-tyrosine and free tRNA (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This deacylase can also hydrolyze d-Trp-tRNATrp and d-Asp-tRNAAsp (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) but not l-aminoacyl-tRNAs (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase is encoded by the dtd gene in E. coli (8Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and by the DTD1 gene in S. cerevisiae (5Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11626-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Homologs of dtd/DTD1 genes occur in many bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Upon inactivation of E. coli dtd or S. cerevisiae DTD1 gene, cell growth becomes more sensitive to the presence of various d-amino acids in the culture medium: d-Tyr, d-Trp, d-Asp, d-Gln, and d-Ser in E. coli and d-Tyr and d-Leu in S. cerevisiae (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This behavior suggests that the toxicity of various d-amino acids can be at least partially contributed for by the formation of d-aminoacyl-tRNAs at the expense of the corresponding l-aminoacyl-tRNAs and that d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase prevents this toxicity by recycling d-aminoacyl-tRNAs into free tRNA molecules. To establish the involvement of tRNA in the toxicity of d-amino acids in vivo, we analyzed the nature of the amino acid linked to tRNATyr when bacteria were grown in the presence of d-tyrosine. In a strain lacking d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase, about 40% of the cellular tRNATyr was found esterified with d-tyrosine. In the parental dtd+ strain, no d-Tyr-tRNATyr could be detected. These results indicate that d-Tyr-tRNATyr formation can starve the cell for l-Tyr-tRNATyr and that the deacylase prevents the starvation by hydrolyzing d-Tyr-tRNATyr. We also studied the effect of tRNA overproduction on the toxicity of d-Tyr, d-Trp, or d-Asp for Δdtd E. coli cells. A protection was observed when the overproduced tRNA corresponded to the d-amino acid added to the growth medium. Upon a ∼3-fold tRNATyr overproduction, the concentration of l-Tyr-tRNATyr increases proportionally and, in a Δdtd cell, such an increase in the l-Tyr-tRNATyr concentration accounts for the relief of the d-tyrosine toxicity. d-[methylene-3H]Tyrosine (211 GBq/mmol) was custom-prepared by Amersham Biosciences. l-[14C]Tyrosine (18.3 GBq/mmol), l-[5-3H]tryptophan (740 GBq/mmol), d-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid (666 GBq/mmol), and l-[2,3-3H]aspartic acid (703 GBq/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Cultures were started in M9-glucose without d-amino acid. After ∼8 h of growth, bacteria were diluted at a final OD650 of 0.0007–0.001 in medium containing or not the d-amino acid. When the OD650 of the culture reached 0.2–0.3, bacteria were diluted again into the medium under study to obtain a final OD650 of 0.005. These cultures were used to measure the generation times. The toxicity indices of d-aspartate were determined as described earlier for the toxicity indices of d-cysteine (10Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40864-40872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were pregrown to mid-exponential phase (0.2–0.3 OD650) at 37 °C in M9-glucose minimal medium. Cells were then inoculated in liquid M9-glucose medium containing different concentrations of d-aspartate to give an OD650 of 0.005. The toxicity index is defined as the d-aspartate concentration causing a 2-fold reduction in the optical density of the culture after an 8-h incubation at 37 °C, as compared with the optical density of a culture without d-aspartate. The d-tryptophan toxicity was also assayed on solid medium. Cells were grown at 37 °C for 40–48 h on M9-glucose minimal medium agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and different concentrations of d-tryptophan (0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mm).

Possibly because of a high overproduction of tRNA, introduction of these plasmids into strain K37ΔrecA or K37ΔTyrHΔrecA resulted in the formation of colonies of variable size when plated on M9-glucose minimal medium supplemented with ampicillin. To obtain a lower overproduction of tRNA, the BamHI-XhoI fragments of the various pBSTNAV derivatives were introduced into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBR322. These fragments carried both the tRNA gene and the Plpp promoter of pBSTNAV. The resulting plasmids (pBRtyrT, pBRtrpT, and pBRaspT) were used to transform E. coli strains K37ΔrecA and K37ΔTyrHΔrecA. Growth of the transformed cells on minimal medium was homogeneous and reproducible. Amino Acid Acceptance of Crude tRNA Extracts—Strains harboring the pBRtyrT, pBRtrpT, or pBRaspT plasmids were grown overnight in 40 ml of 2× TY medium (1.6% bacto-tryptone, 1% bacto-yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. After the preparation of crude tRNA extracts (11Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Fayat G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8095-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), l-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, and l-aspartate acceptances were measured as described earlier (6Soutourina J. Plateau P.

Chem. 1976; 251: 3392-3398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 60 ml of M9-glucose minimal medium. When the optical density of the culture reached 0.8 at 650 nm, 6.6 ml of ice-cold 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.66 ml of 1% (w/v) Brij 58 were added. After incubation in an ice bath for 10 min, cells were collected by centrifugation (20 min, 4 °C, 12,000 × g) and suspended in 1 ml of 0.25 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.05% Brij 58. An equal volume of phenol equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was added, and the mixture was sonicated for a total of 2 min (three 40-s strokes, with 1-min intervals, on ice). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the aqueous layer was collected and precipitated with ethanol. Aminoacylation Level Measurements—To evaluate the amounts of l-Tyr-tRNATyr, d-Tyr-tRNATyr, and peptidyl-tRNATyr in the aminoacyl-tRNA preparation, four aliquots were treated in parallel. (i) tRNA in the first aliquot was fully deacylated by an incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h in the presence of 2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). (ii) In the second aliquot, d-aminoacyl-tRNAs were specifically deacylated by a treatment with d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase. For this purpose, the sample was suspended in 20 mm MES-KOH 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; EF, elongation factor. (pH 6.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2, and pure E. colid-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was added at a final concentration of 1 μm.We verified that this concentration of deacylase was sufficient to fully deacylate d-[3H]Tyr-tRNATyr substrate at a concentration close to that of total tRNATyr in the test (data not shown). The mixture was incubated at 28 °C for 5 min. l-aminoacyl-tRNAs, which are resistant to the action of the deacylase, were then acetylated to avoid deacylation during the subsequent incubation in the presence of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. Therefore, the sample was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 5 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0). Acetylation of the aminoacyl-tRNAs remaining in the sample was performed as described earlier (15Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4760-4769Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). (iii) The third aliquot was processed exactly as the second one except that d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase was omitted from the reaction mixture. (iv) Finally, the fourth aliquot was incubated in the presence of CuSO4 to hydrolyze aminoacyl but not N-acyl-aminoacyl tRNA ester linkages (16Schofield P. Zamecnik P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 155: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17Guillon J.M. Mechulam Y. Schmitter J.M. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The sample was suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5) containing 10 mm CuSO4. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 15 mm EDTA. The tRNA species were precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was washed with a solution containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 75% ethanol and then with a solution containing 2 mm sodium acetate (pH 5), 1 mm MgSO4, and 75% ethanol. To remove remaining copper ions, the sample was dissolved in 500 μl of water and applied on a Micro Bio-Spin chromatography column (from Bio-Rad) filled with 500 μl of Chelex 100 resin (from Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with the same volume of water by gravity flow. The four aliquots were precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 60 μl of water. To control the yield of nucleic acid recovery, the absorbances of the samples were measured at 260 nm. The values obtained for each of the four aliquots were found equal within ±5% error. l-[14C]Tyrosine acceptance of tRNA in each aliquot was measured using E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (28 °C, 10 min), as described earlier (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mm ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 7 μm l-[14C]tyrosine (500 Ci/mol), 1 A260 unit of tRNA, and 0.03 μm tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. From these measurements, the amount of non-esterified tRNATyr was deduced from the l-tyrosine acceptance of the third aliquot. The difference between the acceptances of the second and third aliquots reflected the amount of d-tyrosyl-tRNATyr, the difference between the fourth and second aliquots corresponded to l-tyrosyl-tRNATyr, and the difference between the first and fourth aliquots corresponded to peptidyl-tRNATyr. Intracellular concentration of tRNATyr was calculated using the tyrosine acceptance of the sample treated with 2 m Tris-HCl and the OD650 of the culture used for sample preparation. We assumed that the extraction yield of tRNA was 100% and that, in the cell culture, 1 OD650 corresponded to 0.4 μl of intracellular volume (18Coste H. Brevet A. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12096-12103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of d-Tyr-tRNATyr—Exogeneous d-tyrosine slows down the growth rate of E. coli mutants lacking d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase (8Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One likely reason for the toxicity of d-tyrosine is the immobilization as d-Tyr-tRNATyr of part of the tRNATyr pool. As a consequence, the growth rate would be decreased because of a starvation in l-Tyr-tRNATyr. To test this idea, aminoacyl-tRNAs were extracted from cells grown in the presence or absence of d-tyrosine, and the nature of the amino acid attached to tRNATyr was analyzed. Part of the sample was treated by d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase, whereas another part was incubated in the same conditions without deacylase. Then, the l-tyrosine acceptances of the two samples were compared. If the aminoacyl-tRNA preparation contained d-Tyr-tRNATyr, the l-tyrosine acceptance of the deacylase-treated sample should be higher than that of the non-treated sample. The deacylase treatment did not change the l-tyrosine acceptance of the tRNA samples prepared from the dtd+ strain grown in the presence or absence of d-tyrosine or from the Δdtd strain grown in the absence of d-tyrosine. On the other hand, the incubation with deacylase increased about 4-fold the tyrosine acceptance of the sample from the Δdtd strain grown in the presence of 2.4 mmd-tyrosine (Table II). These results indicate that d-tyrosylated tRNATyr can be formed in vivo and that d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase is involved in the deacylation of this misaminoacylated tRNA species. About 40% of the cellular tRNATyr was esterified with d-tyrosine in the Δdtd context.Table IILevel of tRNATyr aminoacylation in vivoStrainGrowth conditionsaCells were grown at 37 °C in M9-glucose minimal medium supplemented or not with 2.4 mm d-tyrosine.

Open table in a new tab Measurement of Peptidyl-tRNATyr—We also considered the possible formation of d-peptidyl-tRNATyr, i.e. tRNATyr species with a peptide esterified to the terminal adenosine via d-tyrosine. During protein biosynthesis, peptidyl-tRNAs dissociate sometimes prematurely from ribosomes. Such peptidyl-tRNAs are recycled by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, a ubiquitous enzyme found in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells (14Menninger J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3392-3398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schmitt E. Mechulam Y. Fromant M. Plateau P. Blanquet S.

If d-aminoacyl-tRNAs participate in protein synthesis, d-peptidyl-tRNA should be released from the ribosome. Moreover, accumulation of such molecules could be favored by the fact that d-peptidyl-tRNAs are poorer substrates of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase than l-peptidyl-tRNAs (8Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Kössel H. RajBhandary U.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 539-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To investigate the presence of d-peptidyl-tRNATyr, an aliquot of the tRNA preparation was incubated in the presence of CuSO4 to hydrolyze any aminoacyl-tRNAs while preserving all peptidyl-tRNAs. Another aliquot was fully deacylated by an incubation in the presence of 2 m Tris. Finally, the l-tyrosine acceptances of the two samples were compared. Whatever the strain (Δdtd or dtd+) or the presence or absence of 2.4 mmd-tyrosine in the growth medium, the same levels of tyrosylation were obtained within ±5% uncertainty. Therefore, we concluded that neither l- nor d-peptidyl-tRNATyr species were present in significant amounts. This conclusion is in agreement with a previous measurement showing that l-peptidyl-tRNA concentrations remain low in exponentially growing E. coli cells (14Menninger J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3392-3398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overproduction of tRNATyr Reduces the Toxicity of d-Tyrosine—To confirm the idea that accumulation of d-aminoacyl-tRNA at the expense of metabolically active l-aminoacyl-tRNA may be involved in the origin of the toxicity of d-amino acids, we studied the effect of tRNATyr overproduction on the toxicity of d-tyrosine. Indeed, overproduction of this tRNA is expected to cause an increase in the l-Tyr-tRNATyr concentration available for translation. A plasmid overexpressing tRNATyr (pBRtyrT) was constructed and introduced into E. coli strains K37ΔrecA (dtd+) and K37ΔTyrHΔrecA (Δdtd). The presence of this plasmid increased by a factor of ∼3 the total cellular amount of tRNATyr, as compared with the tRNATyr amount in the same strains transformed with the control plasmid pBR322. The presence of the plasmid pBRtyrT significantly diminished the toxicity of d-tyrosine for the Δdtd strain. Thus, the generation time of strain K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBRtyrT) was equal to 78 min when bacteria were grown in M9-glucose minimal medium containing 2.4 mm d-tyrosine. Under the same growth conditions, the generation time of strain K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBR322) was equal to 95 min (Table III). In the absence of d-tyrosine, the generation times of these two strains were similar (67 and 70 min, respectively). They were also similar to the generation times of the dtd+ strains K37ΔrecA(pBRtyrT) and K37ΔrecA(pBR322) grown in the presence or in the absence of d-tyrosine (Table III).Table IIIEffect of d-tyrosine on the growth of various E. coli strainsStrainGeneration timeaCells were grown at 37 °C in M9-glucose minimal medium containing or not 2.4 mm d-tyrosine.

Open table in a new tab tRNAAsp or tRNATrp Overproduction Protects against the Toxicity of d-Aspartate or d-Tryptophan, Respectively—d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase protects E. coli against d-tyrosine but also against a few other d-amino acids including d-Asp and d-Trp (6Soutourina J. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32535-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether, in the case of these two d-amino acids also, an overproduction of tRNA affected the behavior of the Δdtd strain. For this purpose, plasmids overproducing tRNAAsp (pBRaspT) or tRNATrp (pBRtrpT) were introduced in the strains K37ΔTyrHΔrecA and K37ΔTyrH. The level of tRNAAsp in the strains transformed by pBRaspT was ∼2.7-fold higher than in control strains transformed with the plasmid pBR322, whereas the plasmid pBRtrpT increased ∼3.7-fold the level of tRNATrp. The presence of the plasmid pBRaspT conferred to the Δdtd strain (K37ΔTyrHΔrecA) a significant protection against the toxic effect of d-aspartate. Indeed, the d-asparate toxicity index (10Soutourina J. Blanquet S. Plateau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40864-40872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was found to be three times greater in the presence of the pBRaspT plasmid than in the presence of the control plasmid (13 mmversus 4 mm). In the dtd+ context, the toxicity index of d-aspartate was greater than 25 mm, whatever the plasmid harbored (pBRaspT or pBR322) (Table IV).Table IVToxicity indices of d-aspartate for the growth of various E. coli strainsStrainToxicity index of d-aspartatemmK37ΔrecA(pBR322)>25K37ΔrecA(pBRaspT)>25K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBR322)4 ± 1K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBRaspT)13 ± 1K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBRtrpT)3 ± 1K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBRtyrT)6 ± 1 Open table in a new tab To estimate the toxicity of d-tryptophan, dtd+ or Δdtd strains overproducing or not tRNATrp were grown on solid M9-glucose minimal medium containing different concentrations of d-tryptophan. As shown in Fig. 1, the presence of the plasmid pBRtrpT significantly reduced the toxic effect of d-tryptophan on the Δdtd strain K37ΔTyrHΔrecA. At 5 mm d-tryptophan, the growth of cells transformed by the control plasmid pBR322 was clearly more affected than that of cells harboring the plasmid pBRtrpT. The same behavior was observed in liquid M9-glucose minimal medium containing 5 mm d-tryptophan (Table V). Introduction of the plasmid pBRtrpT inside the Δdtd strain significantly improved the growth rate in the presence of the d-amino acid.Table VEffect of d-tryptophan on the growth of various E. coli strainsStrainGeneration timeaCells were grown at 37 °C in M9-glucose minimal medium containing or not 5 mm d-tryptophan.

Open table in a new tab The above results show that overproduction of a given tRNA species helps d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase-deficient bacteria overcome the toxic effect of the corresponding d-amino acid. Nevertheless, it should be noted that each of the Δdtd strains overproducing one given tRNA species remained slightly more sensitive to the corresponding d-amino acid than the parental dtd+ strain. Next, we determined whether the protective effect of a given tRNA was specific of a given amino acid. In liquid medium, the plasmid pBRaspT did not change the generation time of the Δdtd strain in the presence of d-tyrosine (Table III). Similarly, plasmids overproducing tRNATyr or tRNATrp did not enhance the resistance to d-aspartate (Table IV). Finally, plasmids overproducing tRNATyr or tRNAAsp were shown on solid medium not to interfere with the resistance of the Δdtd strain to d-tryptophan (data not shown). Overproduction of tRNATyr Increases the Cellular Concentrations of d- and l-Tyr-tRNATyr—As shown above, overproduction of tRNATyr increases the resistance to d-tyrosine. To understand more precisely the cause of this enhanced resistance, we measured the amounts of d- and l-Tyr-tRNATyr under overproduction conditions. When 2.4 mm d-tyrosine was added to growth medium, the relative concentrations of l- and d-Tyr-tRNATyr in the extract of the strain K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBRtyrT) were equal to 60 ± 6% and 29 ± 3% of total tRNATyr, respectively (Table II). These proportions are similar to those measured in the non-overproducing Δdtd strains K37ΔTyrH and K37ΔTyrHΔrecA(pBR322) (Table II). Since tRNATyr concentration has been increased by a factor of ∼3 in the strain carrying the pBRTyrT plasmid, we can deduce that, upon overproduction of the tRNA, the intracellular concentration of l-Tyr-tRNATyr has become 2–3 times higher than that in the wild-type strain grown in the absence of d-tyrosine. Such an increase in the l-Tyr-tRNATyr concentration available for translation explains how tRNATyr overproduction can relieve the toxicity of d-tyrosine in a Δdtd context. Our results establish that d-tyrosyl-tRNAs can be formed in vivo. Thus, in a deacylase-deficient strain (Δdtd), more than one-third of the total tRNATyr pool can become aminoacylated with the d-isomer of tyrosine when bacteria are grown in the presence of 2.4 mm d-tyrosine. In strains expressing an active d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase, accumulation of d-Tyr-tRNATyr is no longer detected, probably because these molecules are rapidly recycled by the deacylase. The catalytic efficiency of E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase with the d-enantiomer of tyrosine is 15-fold lower than with the l-enantiomer (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, enzymatic production of d-Tyr-tRNATyr must be small if compared with that of l-Tyr-tRNATyr. The observation that one-third of total tRNATyr becomes aminoacylated with d-tyrosine in a Δdtd context suggests that, being metabolically inactive, d-tyrosyl-tRNA molecules accumulate in the cell. As shown above, overproduction of tRNATyr, tRNATrp, or tRNAAsp significantly diminishes the toxicity of d-tyrosine, d-tryptophan, or d-aspartate, respectively. This result is in agreement with the idea that accumulation of d-aminoacyl-tRNA reduces the concentration of l-aminoacyl-tRNAs available for translation. Upon ∼3-fold tRNA overproduction, d-Tyr and l-Tyr-tRNATyr concentrations are each increased by a factor of 2–3. We assume that the increase in the concentration of the only l-Tyr-tRNATyr species is enough to reverse the inhibition of protein synthesis. The protective effect against d-tyrosine resulting from tRNA overproduction is not 100%, however. A deacylase-deficient strain overproducing one given tRNA species still exhibits more sensitivity to the corresponding d-amino acid than the wild-type strain. Therefore, although the l-Tyr-tRNATyr concentration has become 2–3 times higher than that found in the wild-type strain, the presence of d-Tyr-tRNATyr continues to slow down the growth of a deacylase-deficient strain. Such a residual toxicity of d-tyrosine can originate from at least two non-exclusive mechanisms. Firstly, d-aminoacyl-tRNA might be a ligand of the elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Indeed, weak binding of d-Tyr-tRNATyr to the EF-Tu·GTP complex has been reported (23Yamane T. Miller D.L. Hopfield J.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7059-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Competition between EF-Tu-complexed d-aminoacyl- and l-aminoacyl-tRNAs may then occur for the binding to the cognate codon in the A site. Moreover, non-enzymatic binding of d-aminoacyl-tRNA (without the help of EF-Tu) might hinder the A site (24Kemkhadze K.S. Odintsov V.B. Semenkov Y.P. Kirillov S.V. FEBS Lett. 1981; 125: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Rheinberger H.J. Nierhaus K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9133-9139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second mechanism that possibly accounts for the residual toxicity of a d-amino acid deals with the formation of non-functional proteins through full participation of d-aminoacyl-tRNAs to translation. Possible incorporation of d-amino acids into proteins has already been questioned. Stereospecificity of the translational machinery appears to favor l-amino acids (23Yamane T. Miller D.L. Hopfield J.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7059-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity of l-Tyr-tRNATyr for the EF-Tu·GTP complex is 25-fold greater than that of d-Tyr-tRNATyr. Similarly, the formation of the ribosome·aminoacyl-tRNA complex from the ternary complex EF-Tu·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA occurs about 10-fold more efficiently when the amino acid is in l-conformation. Finally, a factor of 5 in favor of the l-amino acid arises from the more frequent detachment of d-aminoacyl-tRNA from the ribosome than that of l-aminoacyl-tRNA, before the reaction of transpeptidation. The combined effects of these three steps would provide a total discrimination factor of ∼1200 in favor of l-tyrosine. Such a factor suggests that d-tyrosine is excluded from incorporation into peptides under conditions in which l-tyrosine is also present. In agreement with this view, several attempts to incorporate d-amino acids into proteins using chemically misacylated tRNAs in cell-free protein synthesizing systems have been unsuccessful (26Heckler T.G. Roesser J.R. Xu C. Chang P.I. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7254-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Roesser J.R. Xu C. Payne R.C. Surratt C.K. Hecht S.M.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5411-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, Calendar and Berg (7Calendar R. Berg P. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have reported that d-tyrosine from d-tyrosyl-tRNA was incorporated into peptide linkage in an in vitro prokaryotic protein-synthesizing system. The d-tyrosine incorporation was about 6-fold smaller than that of l-tyrosine incorporation from l-tyrosyl-tRNA. Labeled tyrosine incorporated from d-tyrosyl-tRNA was converted to the ketoacid with d-amino acid oxidase but not with l-amino acid oxidase, suggesting that incorporation of d-tyrosine into a polypeptide product occurred without inversion of the amino acid configuration. Champney and Jensen (29Champney W.S. Jensen R.A. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 104: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported an in vivo incorporation of d-tyrosine into the cellular proteins of a B. subtilis strain that efficiently imports this d-amino acid. The radioactivity found in ribosomes and soluble proteins suggested the substitution of about 1% of the l-tyrosine molecules by the d-isomer. In favor of the incorporation of d-tyrosine without pretranslational change in the configuration of the amino acid, no labeled p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate was detected when acid hydrolysates of labeled proteins were treated with l-amino acid oxidase. However, treatment with d-amino acid oxidase was also ineffective in liberating p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. An inhibition of d-amino acid oxidase by aromatic compounds in the hydrolysate was proposed to be at the origin of this contradictory observation. Finally, very recently, efficient incorporation of d-phenylalanine and d-methionine could be obtained in vitro provided that mutant ribosomes were used (30Dedkova L.M. Fahmi N.E. Golovine S.Y. Hecht S.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6616-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). With wild-type ribosomes, the incorporation was lower but still detectable. In the present study, accumulation in the cell of d-peptidyl-tRNA could not be evidenced. At first glance, the lack of detection of this tRNA species argues against that idea that d-tyrosine could be incorporated into proteins. However, before we can reach a conclusion, the slight activity of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase against d-peptidyl-tRNA molecules has to be taken into consideration. Indeed, the in vitro activity of the hydrolase toward N-blocked-d-Tyr-tRNATyr is only 150-fold smaller than that measured with N-blocked-l-Tyr-tRNATyr (8Soutourina J. Plateau P. Delort F. Peirotes A. Blanquet S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19109-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, one cannot exclude that, if d-peptidyl-tRNAs were eventually produced in vivo, these molecules would be destroyed by the hydrolase. Clearly, more studies are necessary to unambiguously decide whether some d-amino acid misincorporation into proteins can occur in vivo. We are grateful to C. Lazennec and B. Raveglia for technical support."
https://openalex.org/W2042515526,"The Xvent-2B promoter is regulated by a BMP-2/4-induced transcription complex comprising Smad signal transducers and specific transcription factors. Using a yeast one-hybrid screen we have found that Oct-25, a Xenopus POU domain protein related to mammalian Oct-3/4, binds as an additional factor to the Xvent-2B promoter. This interaction was further confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo analyses. The Oct-25 gene is mainly transcribed during blastula and gastrula stages in the newly forming ectodermal and mesodermal germ layers. Luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that Oct-25 stimulates transcription of the Xvent-2B gene. This stimulation depends on the Oct-25 binding site and the bone morphogenetic protein-responsive element. Furthermore, Oct-25 interacts in vitro with components of the Xvent-2B transcription complex, like Smad1/4 and Xvent-2. Overexpression of Oct-25 results in anterior/posterior truncations and lack of differentiation for neuroectoderm- and mesoderm-derived tissues including blood cells. This effect is consistent with an evolutionarily conserved role of class V POU factors in the maintenance of an undifferentiated cell state. In Xenopus, the molecular mechanism underlying this process might be coupled to the expression of Xvent proteins.

Xvent genes are homeobox genes of the Nkx/Bar subfamily that are mainly expressed at the ventral side of Xenopus embryos starting at the blastula stage of development (1Gawantka V. Delius H.

The Xvent-2B gene or its pseudoallelic variant, the Xvent-2 gene, has been characterized as a direct target gene of BMP-2/4 signaling (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This signaling cascade involves receptor-specific Smads, like Smad1, -5, or -8, which after phosphorylation by a type I BMP receptor associate with receptor-unspecific Smads, like Smad4, and are translocated to the nucleus, where they recruit specific transcription factors to activate their target genes (12Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4761) Google Scholar). The closely related promoters of the Xvent-2 and Xvent-2B genes contain a BMP-response element (BRE), which is composed of Smad binding sites for Smad4 and Smad1 as well as binding sites for specific transcription factors, like OAZ or Xvent-2 itself (10Hata A.

These factors have been shown to interact with the Smads, and they are required for the transcription complex to be targeted to the BRE because the binding affinity of Smads alone to DNA is rather weak. Xvent-2 has also been shown to mediate the autocatalytic loop of BMP-4 expression because it strongly activates BMP-4 transcription by binding to an intron-located enhancer (14Metz A. Knöchel S. Büchler P. Köster M. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1998; 74: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Schuler-Metz A. Knöchel S. Kaufmann E. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34365-34374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, Xvent-2 has a dual autoregulatory effect on its own expression. First, it stimulates BMP-4 transcription, thereby enhancing BMP-4 expression and signaling, and second, it is part of the transcription complex regulating its own promoter (13Henningfeld K.A. Friedle H. Rastegar S. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the molecular architecture of the Xvent-2B transcription complex and to characterize additional compounds, we have screened a gastrula stage cDNA expression library for proteins that bind to a selected region of the Xvent-2B promoter (one-hybrid screening). This procedure led to the identification of Oct-25, a previously described class V member of the POU domain proteins in Xenopus (16Hinkley C.S. Martin J.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The gene had been reported to be mainly expressed during gastrulation, and the protein shares a high degree of sequence conservation with the mammalian Oct-3/4 factor (17Okamoto K. Okazawa H. Okuda A. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Hamada H. Cell. 1990; 60: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 18Rosner M.H. Vigano M.A. Ozato K. Timmons P.M. Poirier F. Rigby P.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). We show here that Oct-25 transcripts are highly abundant in the forming ectoderm and mesoderm, persist during early neurulation in the posterior neuroectoderm, and are still present within the tip of the tail at tadpole stage. Although neither the temporal nor the spatial expression patterns exactly correlate to those reported for mammalian Oct-3/4, we show by RNA microinjection experiments that Oct-25 inhibits terminal differentiation of mesodermal and neuroectodermal derivatives. Such an inhibition of differentiation is reminiscent to the role of Oct-3/4 in pluripotent embryonic stem cells (20Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiadis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Schöler H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Oct-25 leads to an up-regulation of BMP-4 and Xvent genes. We further show that Oct-25 binds to the Xvent-2B promoter not only in vitro but also in vivo and that it interacts with Xvent-2, another component of the transcription complex. Reporter gene expression directed by the Xvent-2B promoter is up-regulated by Oct-25. This activation requires the Oct-25 binding site but is also dependent upon the BMP signaling pathway. These studies indicate for the first time a functional role of this POU domain protein in BMP signaling, and they suggest evolutionarily conserved mechanisms in the primary inhibition of terminal differentiation. Construction of cDNA Expression Library and One-hybrid Screen— Total RNA was isolated from gastrula stage Xenopus embryos by TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction and subsequently enriched for poly(A) RNA by affinity chromatography on poly(dT) cellulose. RNA was transcribed into cDNA and integrated into the multicloning site of plasmid pGADT (Clontech) generating GAL-4 activation domain fusion constructs under the direction of the strong ADH1 promoter. The primary library yielded 1 × 106 colony-forming units, the insert size varying between 0.8 and 5 kb. The library was amplified in semisolid SeqPlaque-agarose generating about 109 total transformants (Stratagene plasmid library construction kit). The reporter for the yeast one-hybrid screening was constructed by unidirectional multimerization of AvaI site-flanked recognition site oligomers (from position –267 to –214 of the Xvent-2B gene (5Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) followed by insertion into pHISi (Clontech) and pLacZi (Clontech) (21Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Library and reporter constructs were co-transformed into yeast strain YM4271 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, leu2–3,112, trp1–901, tyr1–50, gal4-Δ512, gal80-Δ538, ade5::hisG). Clones indicating protein-DNA interaction were isolated on minimal yeast medium lacking histidine (pHISi) and uracil (pLacZi), respectively. The application of two reporter constructs reduces the number of false positive results (22Wei Z. Angerer R.C. Angerer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Low level expression of the HIS3 in a leaky manner is prevented by titration with the competitive inhibitor 3-aminotriazole between 0 and 40 mm. For further experimental details see the Clontech yeast protocols handbook (www.Clontech.de). Constructs, RNA Synthesis, and Microinjection—Xenopus Oct-25 cDNA including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was subcloned to the EcoRI site of pCS2+ (23Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) to generate the expression construct pCS2+ Oct-25. To fuse the myc tag in-frame to the N terminus of Oct-25, the coding sequence of Oct-25 was PCR-amplified and subcloned to the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pCS2+ MT to generate pCS2+ MT-Oct-25. pCS2+ Oct-25 or pCS2+ MT-Oct-25 was cut with NotI. Capped mRNA was synthesized with the mMessage mMachine™ kit (Ambion). For overexpression of Oct-25, the RNA was injected in a total dose of 150 pg, 300 pg, or 1 ng, respectively, into all four blastomeres at the 4-cell stage. For ChIP analysis, MT-Oct-25 RNA was injected in a total dose of 600 pg into all four blastomeres at the 4-cell stage. RT-PCR—Synthetic Oct-25 mRNA was injected in a total dose of 600 pg into all four blastomeres at the 4-cell stage. Injected and uninjected control embryos were collected at stage 19 or 30, respectively, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy kit (Qiagen), followed by DNase I treatment and purification again with RNeasy kit. First strand cDNA was synthesized with RevertAid™ H Minus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). Primers were as follows: ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), forward, 5′-GGGCAAAGGAGCTTAATGTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CATTGGCAGCATCTTCTTCA-3′; BMP-4, forward, 5′-GTCAGTCTAATCCCCGCAGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATCGTGCAGCTCATCCTCTT-3′; Xvent-2, forward, 5′-AATCCAAGATGGCAGACCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGGGAGGACAGAAGTCCAT-3′; neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), forward, 5′-GCCCCTCTTGTGGATCTTAGTGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACAGCGGCAGGAGTAGCAGTTC-3′; epidermal keratin, forward, 5′-ACTATCGGCAGCCTAGAGGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACACTTCAGGATCTCAGGGAAG-3′; α-globin, forward, 5′-AAGCCAACTAGCTCCCTCTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAATTTGTCCCAAGCAGCAT-3′; cardiac α-actin, forward, 5′-GGAAATGAACGTTTCCGTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTGCTTGGAGGAGTGTGTGT-3′; and XAG (Xenopus anterior gradient), forward, 5′-GCTTTTGTCGCTGATCGAAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTTGGGAGTTGCTTCTCTGG-3′. Preparation of Fusion Proteins—Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) and purified in batch under native conditions. His-tagged Oct-25 or the His-tagged DNA binding domain of Oct-25, a POU/homeodomain construct, was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The purified His-tagged proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol), and the GST-tagged proteins were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol). 35S-Labeled proteins were prepared using the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). DNase I Footprinting—Xvent-2B promoter fragment (–305/–123) was generated by PCR and cloned by use of the Qiagen PCR cloning kit into the pDrive vector in both orientations. After cleavage with BamHI/Hin-dIII the dephosphorylated fragments were 5′-labeled and cleaved with SalI. Binding reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min in 30 μl of binding buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 13.2% glycerol) containing 1 μg poly(dI-dC) and the Oct-25 protein. After 5 min of preincubation, 1 ng of the gel-purified probe was added and incubated for 30 min. The concentration of MgCl2 was subsequently raised to 5 mm for DNase I footprinting, and 0.065 unit (free DNA) or 0.195 unit (DNA + protein) of DNase I was added at room temperature for 45 s. The DNase I digestion was stopped by addition of an equal volume of sample buffer (66% deionized formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 660 mm sucrose). Chemical sequencing reactions were performed for sequence alignment. After preelectrophoresis for 2 h at 70 W, samples were analyzed by 8 and 6% denaturing PAGE at 60 W in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed with wild type or mutated sense and antisense oligonucleotides ranging from position –234 to –204. The oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with γ-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and subsequently annealed. The gel-purified probes were incubated with the POU/homeodomain of Oct-25 protein on ice for 25 min in 30 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.25 μg poly(dI-dC)). Luciferase Assay—For promoter analysis, the –275/+44 Xvent-2B sequence or 5′- as well as internal deletions were cloned in pGL3 vector (Promega) and injected into both blastomeres at the 2-cell stage. In the same way the promoter/reporter constructs were co-injected with 250 pg of Oct-25 RNA or 300 pg of BMP-4 RNA. Embryos injected with luciferase reporter constructs were collected when control embryos had reached stage 12 (24Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). 2nd Ed. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar) and homogenized in 1× lysis buffer (Promega) using 10 μl of buffer/embryo. Samples were left on ice for 10 min followed by a 5-min centrifugation (10,000 rpm) at 4 °C to pellet debris. Luciferase assays were performed with 20 μl of lysate (two embryo equivalents) and with 20 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold). Internal controls for transcriptional activities were performed by using the CMV-pRL vector (cytomegalovirus promoter in front of the Renilla luciferase) and the instructions given by the supplier (Promega). ChIP—ChIP was performed according to a recently published procedure (25Reinke H. Hörz W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1599-1607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and modified for Xenopus. 2K. Mansperger and R. Rupp, personal communication. About 200 MT-Oct-25-injected embryos of NLS (nuclear localization signal)-MT-injected embryos or uninjected embryos were fixed in 0.5× MBSH (1× MBSH: 88 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min to cross-link proteins to DNA. Cross-linking was then quenched by adding 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Embryos were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4) and homogenized in low salt buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm DTT, Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixture) with a French press three times at 850 psi. Homogenates were precipitated, and supernatants were precleared with preblocked protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). 15 μl of rabbit anti-c-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to chromatin supernatants, while leaving an aliquot without antibody for negative control, and incubated overnight. To precipitate chromatin, blocked protein G-agarose was added and incubated for 2–3 h. Agarose beads were spun down and washed once with low salt buffer, twice with high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 1 mm DTT, Roche Applied Science Complete protease inhibitor mixture), twice with LiCl solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium desoxycholate), and again twice with low salt buffer. Protein-DNA complex was then eluted twice with low salt buffer containing 1% SDS at room temperature, and cross-linking was reversed at 65 °C overnight. After digestion with proteinase K, DNA was phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 50 μl of TE (10 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA). Xvent-2B promoter was assayed with the immunoprecipitated DNA and the supernatant DNA using the Xvent-2B promoter primers (forward) 5′-TGAGCATCACAGATGGCATT-3′ (position –364) and (reverse) 5′-AGGGAGGAAGAGCCCATCTA-3′ (position –4). GST Pull-down Assay—GST pull-down assays were performed as described recently (26Friedle H. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23872-23881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ΔN and ΔC mutants of Xvent-2 have been reported elsewhere (13Henningfeld K.A. Friedle H. Rastegar S. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and Oct-25 mutants were generated by PCR using the following primers: Oct-25ΔC, forward, 5′-GGAATTCATGTACAGCCAACAGCCCTT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGCCGTCGTTCTCCTCAACGGT-3′, including a termination signal; and Oct-25ΔN, forward, 5′-GGAATTCATGAGCGAATCAGAAATGGAGCA-3′ (this primer encodes an additional methionine), and reverse, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGCCAATGTGGCCCCCCA-3′. The mutant Oct-25ΔPH that excludes both the POU and the homeodomain was synthesized in two parts. The N-terminal part was created using the Oct-25ΔC forward primer and a reverse primer, 5′-GGGGTACCGGGAACCTCCTCCTCATT-3′. The C-terminal part was generated using a forward primer, 5′-GGGGTACCGAAGGCTACGATGTTGCACA-3′, and the Oct-25ΔN reverse primer. Both fragments were fused via the included KpnI site (underlined). One-hybrid Screen—The present investigation was initiated by the observation that the activity of the Xvent-2B promoter as judged by reporter gene expression after injection into Xenopus embryos was markedly reduced when nucleotides from –275 to –220 were deleted (5Rastegar S. Friedle H. Frommer G. Knöchel W. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Lee H.S. Park M.J. Lee S.Y. Hwang Y.S. Lee H. Roh D.H. Kim J.I. Park J.B. Lee J.Y.

This region neither contains the identified Smad1/4 binding sites nor the OAZ binding site required for activation (Fig. 1A) (10Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21827-21835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13Henningfeld K.A. Friedle H. Rastegar S. Knöchel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2097-2103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify further factors that influence Xvent-2/2B gene activity, we have performed a one-hybrid screen (21Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) by using the –267 to –214 region (Fig. 1B) as bait to be targeted by proteins expressed from gastrula stage RNA. Because these proteins had been fused to the GAL-4 transcriptional activation domain, binding of fusion proteins to the Xvent-2B promoter element led to the expression of His or LacZ genes in corresponding yeast deficiency strains. Subsequent usage of two different reporter genes has proven a valuable tool to eliminate false positives, which had been isolated after the first round in using only one reporter (22Wei Z. Angerer R.C. Angerer L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The procedure led to the isolation of seven clones, one of which was identified to code for the POU domain protein Oct-91/XLPOU91 (16Hinkley C.S. Martin J.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Frank D. Harland R.M. Development. 1992; 115: 439-448PubMed Google Scholar) and the remaining six to code for the POU domain protein Oct-25 (16Hinkley C.S. Martin J.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the Oct-25 sequences had obviously been derived from different cDNAs. They all encoded the complete POU-specific domain (POUS) and the POU homeodomain (POUH), but some of them varied and were not complete with respect to their length at the 3′-end. To obtain a full-size Oct-25 transcript, we next have screened a gastrula stage cDNA library by using the incomplete sequence as labeled probe. This led to the isolation of the complete sequence (sequence data have been submitted to the DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ)/European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)/GenBank™ data bases under accession number AJ699165), which differed at the nucleotide level by 0.6% and at the amino acid level by five of 449 amino acids from the previously published sequence (16Hinkley C.S. Martin J.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and led to an extension or completion of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. Based upon its homology to POU factors from other species, Oct-25 had been classified as a member of the class V POU domain proteins (29Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Spatial Expression of Oct-25 in the Xenopus Embryo—A previous report on the temporal expression had shown that very low levels of Oct-25 transcripts are present in oocytes and early cleavage embryos (16Hinkley C.S. Martin J.F. Leibham D. Perry M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The amount of transcripts is dramatically increased during gastrulation. Transcripts persist during early neurulation but were no longer detectable by the end of neurulation. We now have analyzed the spatial distribution of Oct-25 transcripts by using the whole mount in situ hybridization technique (30Harland R.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we could not detect any transcripts in preblastula stage embryos (data not shown), zygotic transcription is strongly activated after midblastula transition within the animal half in both the forming mesoderm and ectoderm (Fig. 2, A–C). In support of the reported temporal pattern, most intense staining is observed at stage 11 (Fig. 2B). Subsequent expression is gradually restricted to the dorsal neuroectoderm with a sharp boundary at the anterior front (Fig. 2D). A transverse section through an early neurula shows no expression in the notochord and the presomitic mesoderm but strong expression in the overlaying neuroectoderm (Fig. 2M). The anterior boundary was examined by double whole mount hybridizations using Krox-20 or en-2 as additional probes (Fig. 2, E and F). Expression of Oct-25 is observed to be more anterior than that of Krox-20, which is transcribed in rhombomeres 3 and 5, but coincides with that of en-2, which demarcates the hindbrain/midbrain boundary. Therefore, expression of Oct-25 in neuroectoderm at the early neurula stage extends to the future hindbrain/midbrain boundary. However, as neurulation proceeds, Oct-25 transcripts become localized to the posterior part of the central nervous system (Fig. 2, G–K). We here demonstrate that they persist during development and are clearly present within the tip of the tail even at stage 35 (Fig. 2L). In summary, the Oct-25 gene is zygotically activated at the blastula stage within future mesoderm and ectoderm; transcription reaches a maximum at the midgastrula stage and thereafter becomes restricted to the future neuroectoderm. Initial expression within the neuroectoderm extends until the future hindbrain/midbrain boundary, but later on, it is progressively shifted toward the posterior pole, where it persists within the tip of the tail in hatching embryos. Functional Analysis of Oct-25 by Gain of Function and Loss of Function—To gain insights into the biological function of Oct-25, ectopic overexpression and antisense morpholino oligonucleotide-based knock-down strategies were applied. Injection of Oct-25 RNA into all four blastomeres of 4-cell stage embryos led in a dose-dependent manner to an increased rate of mortality during gastrulation. Although more than 90% (n = 72) of embryos survived at an injected amount of 150 pg, only 80% (n = 45) or 50% (n = 82) continued development at 300 pg or 1 ng, respectively. The surviving embryos suffered from severe differentiation defects along the body axis (Fig. 3, A–C). They show a loss of head structures including brain and eyes, no spinal cord, which is obviously because of loss of closure of the neural tube, no somite structures, and no extension of the tail. Moreover, nearly all injected embryos exhibit an accumulation of darkly pigmented cells either at their lateral or ventral sides. Except for the formation of the cement gland, which is present in all embryos injected with 150 or 300 pg, respectively, it seems that ectopic overexpression of Oct-25 results in a failure of differentiation for most tissues. Injection of different doses of the morpholino into embryos did not induce any phenotypic effect (data not shown). At the present moment we cannot decide whether this is because of functional redundancy by closely related genes or because of the possibility that the morpholino does not react with the pseudoallelic version of Oct-25.

https://openalex.org/W1995308264,"We examined the effect of inhibiting p38 MAPK on UVA-irradiated HaCaT cells, a spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line. Recent work from our laboratory has shown that UVA (250 kJ/m2) induces a rapid phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the HaCaT cell line. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity through the use of a specific inhibitor, SB202190, in combination with UVA treatment induced a rapid cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3, whereas UVA irradiation alone had no effect. Similarly, cleavage of the caspase substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was observed in UVA-irradiated HaCaT cells treated with SB202190 or in cells expressing a dominant-negative p38 MAPK. No effect of p38 MAPK inhibition upon caspase cleavage was observed in mock-irradiated HaCaT cells. In addition, increases in apoptosis were observed in UVA-irradiated cells treated with SB202190 by morphological analysis with no significant apoptosis occurring from UVA irradiation alone. Similar results were obtained by using normal human epidermal keratinocytes. UVA induced expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bcl-XL, with abrogation of expression by using the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190. Overexpression of Bcl-XL prevented poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage induced by the combination of UVA and p38 MAPK inhibition. UVA enhanced the stability of Bcl-XL mRNA through increases in p38 MAPK activity. We determined that increases in UVA-induced expression of Bcl-XL occur through a posttranscriptional mechanism mediated by the 3′-untranslated region (UTR). We used Bcl-XL 3′-UTR luciferase constructs to determine the mechanism by which UVA increased Bcl-XL mRNA stability. Additionally, RNA binding studies indicate that UVA increases the binding of RNA-binding proteins to Bcl-XL 3′-UTR mRNA, which can be decreased by using SB202190. In conclusion, p38 MAPK and Bcl-XL expression play critical roles in the survival of UVA-irradiated HaCaT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2052439803,"The vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (or V-ATPase) is a membrane protein complex that is structurally related to F1 and F0 ATP synthases. The V-ATPase is composed of an integral domain (V0) and a peripheral domain (V1) connected by a central stalk and up to three peripheral stalks. The number of peripheral stalks and the proteins that comprise them remain controversial.

Thereby, they participate in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological states such as acid-base balance in the kidney, bone resorption by osteoclasts, and metastatic invasion by tumor cells to name a few (reviewed in Refs. 8Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar and 9Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar).V-ATPases are multisubunit protein complexes composed of 13 polypeptide chains. Electron microscopy images as well as analysis of subunit stoichiometry have revealed some analogy in the overall bilobed structure of V-ATPase and F-ATPase (10Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bowman B.J. Dschida W.J. Harris T. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15606-15612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well established that the V-ATPase segregates into two main functional domains: V0, which forms the core of the proton translocating machinery associated with the membrane (subunits acc′c″d), is functionally homologous to the F0 domain of the F-ATPases; and V1, which contains the catalytic sites (subunits A-H), is functionally homologous to the F1 domain of F-ATPases. ATP hydrolysis takes place in the A3B3 hexamer of V1, and the energy provided by this reaction is transmitted to V0 via the connecting regions to drive proton translocation. Similarly to the F-type ATPase, a rotational mechanism linking these two functionalities has been proposed (12Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Hirata T. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Sun-Wada G.H. Okajima T. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23714-23719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Despite these similarities, V-ATPases differ significantly from F-ATPases in some respect. In particular, electron microscopy has revealed significant protrusions in the connecting elements linking V0 to V1 (14Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Domgall I. Venzke D. Lüttge U. Ratajczak R. Böttcher B. J. Biol.

In addition, extensive experimental characterization of these connecting elements using different techniques such as chemical cross-linking and low resolution imaging has led to the proposal of several models for their topological arrangement (16Tomashek J.J.

Although only limited homology exists between the V- and F-ATPase subunits (21Bowman B.J. Allen R. Wechser M.A. Bowman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 172: 137-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), some sequence similarities between the soluble domain of subunit b of the Escherichia coli F-ATPase and subunit G of the V-ATPase have led to the proposal that these proteins are functionally analogous (24Supekova L. Supek F. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13726-13732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp.

Subunit b of F-ATPases serves to fix F1 to F0 and forms a stator through its membrane anchor, thereby preventing rotation of the F1 domain during catalysis (27Hermolin J. Gallant J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14550-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Perlin D.S. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9793-9800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In V-ATPases, subunit G lacks the length required to reach the top of the catalytic head and to bridge V1 to V0 in a similar fashion. It also lacks a membrane anchor that would be required for this stator function and is therefore assumed to interact with another subunit to fulfill this presumed role. Sequence analysis has revealed some features that might be important for such interactions (26Hunt I.E. Bowman B.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Recently we have proposed a topology for the assembly of a plant V-ATPase based on a three-dimensional electronic microscopy reconstruction model (15Domgall I. Venzke D. Lüttge U. Ratajczak R. Böttcher B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13115-13121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and published cross-linking data. According to this model, subunits E and G would interact to form a peripheral stalk in analogy to subunits I and II of the chloroplast ATP-synthase (29McCarty R.E. Evron Y. Johnson E.A. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 83-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), subunit b of E. coli F-ATPase (22McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 30Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the subunit b of mitochondrial ATPase. Although the number of subunits composing the stalk is known, their arrangement is still a matter of controversy (12Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 31Grüber G. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Link T.A. Coskun U. Rizzo V.F. Betz C. Bailer S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8609-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). There is currently no clear structural or biochemical data that provide unambiguous solutions to the topological arrangement of the V-ATPase subunits, although understanding this arrangement is essential to determining the enzymatic mechanism and the different modes of metabolic regulation that occur in vivo. The current study attempts to clarify this matter by providing strong biochemical evidence for the tight interaction between subunits E and G. We introduce, for the first time, the use of a co-expression system with differentially tagged subunits for the investigation of their specific interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression—Subunits E and G were cloned by PCR using a Saccaromyces cerevisae genomic DNA library as template. For subunit E, primers were ATG GCC ATG GGC ATG TCC TCC TCC GCT A (forward) and GGG GTA CCT CAA TCA AAG AAC TTT CTT GTC T (reverse). For subunit G they were CAT GCC ATG GGC ATG TCC CAA AAA AAC (forward) and GGG GTA CCT ACA AGG CAT TGA TAT GGA CTT (reverse). PCR products were subcloned into a modified pET expression vector (pETM-41 from G. Stier, European Molecular Biology Laboratory) using the NcoI and KpnI sites (underlined in the above sequences), 3′ of a hexa-histidine tag, MBP fusion protein, and TEV cleavage site. Identity of the cloned products was confirmed by sequencing. The resulting vectors were transformed into E. coli strain BL-21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) and plated onto LB-agar supplemented with kanamycin (30 μg/ml). For expression of the subunits, a single colony was used to inoculate 4 ml of LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and grown overnight at 37 °C. This culture was diluted 1:1000 into 500 ml of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and grown to an A600 of 0.6 after which induction with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was started. Expression was performed at 19 °C overnight in Innova shakers at 180 rpm.For the co-expression experiments, a bicistronic expression vector based on a modified pET24d (Novagen) vector was constructed with a single promoter and a 26-nucleotide linker separating the two open reading frames. An N-terminal histidine tag was kept on subunit G. Subunit E followed in its native form. The resulting bicistronic plasmid was transformed into BL21-star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen) carrying a pRARE plasmid (Novagen) with chloramphenicol selection and colonies selected on kanamycin/chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml, 20 μg/ml) LB-agar plates. For expression of the EG complex, a single colony was picked and grown in 500 ml of terrific broth medium (supplemented with antibiotics) to A600 of 0.8 after which expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Expression was carried out at room temperature for 20 h.Purification and Complex Formation—Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed in PBS supplemented with one tablet/100 ml of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) using a cell emulsifier (Emulsiflex-C5, Avestin). Lysed cells were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min, and recombinant protein in the supernatant was purified by metal chelating affinity chromatography using a Talon cobalt column (Clontech) pre-equilibrated with PBS. After an extensive wash of the resin with PBS, the protein was eluted with a 0–0.5 m imidazole gradient, and fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The fractions containing the protein were pooled, diluted 2-fold with Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and the buffer was exchanged for 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, by anion exchange chromatography. The elution product was then used directly for cleavage from the fusion partner using the TEV protease. Digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml TEV. Initially, both subunits were purified separately for independent characterization of their properties. After cleavage, the MBP fusion partner, which retained the histidine tag, was separated from the protein of interest using the cobalt affinity column. The recombinant subunits in the flow-through were further purified by ion exchange chromatography (HiTrapQ-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences) and gel filtration (Superose 12 column, Amersham Biosciences) to yield the final pure proteins. Samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration on centriprep YM30-membranes (Millipore), and protein concentration was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. To characterize the specific interaction between subunits E and G, purified MBP-E and MBP-G were mixed and cleaved with TEV protease (10 μg/ml). The cleaved product was separated from the MBP fusion partner with a second cobalt affinity step. The flow-through of this step consisted essentially of the EG complex and uncomplexed monomers. The complex was further purified by ion exchange and gel filtration. Recombinant EG complex co-expressed from the bicistronic vector was purified by metal chelating affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange and gel filtration.CD Measurement—The purified samples were diluted to 200 μg/ml and dialyzed in PBS, pH 7.5. Spectra were acquired in a 0.1-cm path length cell on a Jasco J-710 spectrometer. Far UV scans were collected between 190 nm and 240 nm in 0.1-nm steps at 22 °C. The raw data were converted to molar mean residual ellipticity (Θ) in a standard manner. Secondary structural content was estimated from the CD measurements with the K2D package (33Andrade M.A. Chacón P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar).Cross-linking—The co-expressed EG complex from the bicistronic vector was used for the cross-linking experiments. The protein at a concentration of 0.8 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.5, was incubated with 0.1 mm 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene or Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate and 5mm EDC/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 10 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to stop the reaction. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To analyze the content of the cross-linked species, in-gel proteolytic digestion was performed with trypsin (modified sequencing grade, Roche Applied Sciences), and the proteolytic fragments were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry (Bruker Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany).Electron Microscopy Analysis of the EG Complex—Prior to sample analysis, large debris and aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted 5- to 10-fold with a solution containing 100 mm NaCl and 35% sucrose. The grids were prepared as described in Ref. 34Golas M.M. Sander B. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Stark H. Science. 2003; 300: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar. In brief, the thin carbon film was floated from a small piece of mica onto the surface of the sample. Then the carbon film was picked up again with the mica and floated on the surface of staining solution (2% uranyl formate). A second carbon film was floated on another aliquot of staining solution. Both films were picked up subsequently with a copper grid so that the sample and stain were sandwiched between the two carbon films. After drying, the grids were examined in a CM-120 Biotwin (FEI Company) microscope operated at 100 kV. Images were recorded at a nominal magnification of ×52,000 on a charge-coupled device or on Kodak S0163 films. Some micrographs were scanned with a Zeiss Scai scanner using a step size of 14 μm for further analysis. Particle images were selected and boxed using the MRC package (35Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Basic image processing (like adjustment of gray values, alignment, and averaging) was done with the IMAGIC V package (36van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression and Purification of the Recombinant Subunits— Both subunits E and G were expressed as soluble MBP fusion proteins in E. coli using low temperature for expression. Expression at 19 °C in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells made it possible to obtain good yield of soluble fusion protein (25–50 mg/liter) in contrast to studies in which subunit E could be expressed only in inclusion bodies (37Harrison M. Durose L. Song C.F. Barratt E. Trinick J. Jones R. Findlay J.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2003; 35: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or with the use of a special osmoregulated system (31Grüber G. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Link T.A. Coskun U. Rizzo V.F. Betz C. Bailer S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, immediately after expression (lanes 3 and 5), the fusion proteins are detectable in the crude supernatant of the cell lysate. The subunits purify readily using a combination of metal-chelating affinity, ion exchange, and gel filtration chromatography. The purity of the overexpressed subunits is verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). As can be seen on this figure, subunits E and G have apparent molecular masses of 28 kDa and 14 kDa, respectively.EG Complex Formation—In an analogy to subunit b of the F0F1-ATP synthase, subunits E and G are believed to form part of the peripheral stalk of the V-ATPase. Several reports have already indicated that these subunits might interact (16Tomashek J.J. Graham L.A. Hutchins M.U. Stevens T.H. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26787-26793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16618-16623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, very few data exist on the isolated subunits. Using our system, we have been able to verify a direct physical interaction between E and G. The EG complex was initially formed by cleaving MBP-E and MBP-G from the MBP fusion partner simultaneously, using an excess of MBP-G fusion protein. The cleaved MBP was washed away by a second Co2+-Talon chromatographic step. Further purification of the complex by ion exchange took advantage of the basic pI of subunit G. At pH 8.0 free subunit G is not retained on an anion exchanger and can be separated from the EG complex. The EG complex together with some free E is then eluted from the column with a salt gradient. Monomeric E elutes very close to the EG-complex from the anion exchanger at 120 mm NaCl, and an extra gel filtration step is necessary to separate them. However, complete separation of the monomer from the complex is not easily achieved. The chromatogram shown in Fig. 2A indicates that subunit E elutes as a shoulder on the EG complex elution peak.Fig. 2Gel filtration chromatogram of subunits E and G and the EG complex in PBS.A, gel filtration analysis was conducted on subunits G and E and the EG complex on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences) using PBS as a buffer. Subunits E and G and the EG complex were run separately on the Superose 12 column, and then the chromatograms were overlaid into one graph. B, using the Low Molecular Weight Calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the Superose 12 column to make the standard curve of Kav versus molecular weight, the Kav and molecular weights of subunits G and E and the EG complex were determined from this standard curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Considering the inability of uncomplexed subunit G to bind to the anion exchanger under the conditions used, its co-elution with E from the ion exchange column is a clear indication of their interaction. One additional piece of evidence indicating the favorable interaction between subunits E and G is the increased stability of both subunits in the complex. Fig. 3 shows significantly reduced proteolytic degradation of subunits E and G after prolonged storage in the EG complex compared with either subunit alone.Fig. 3Stabilization of the subunits E and G in the EG complex after prolonged storage.Lanes 1, 3, and 5 show the respective yeast subunits loaded on SDS-PAGE (12%) right after the last gel filtration step. Lanes 2, 4, and 6 represents the same subunits after an overnight incubation at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm this interaction and obtain pure EG complex, we co-expressed subunits E and G using a bicistronic vector. This strategy achieves selective purification of the complex with elimination of uncomplexed single subunits. Both subunits were overexpressed in this system, and we obtained over 10 mg/liter of pure EG complex. With subunit G carrying the histidine tag, both subunits E and G co-purified from the metal affinity column, indicating their specific interaction. Extensive high salt washes of the bound EG complex did not cause significant release of subunit E, confirming the strength of the interaction. Upon elution with an imidazole gradient, the EG complex as well as uncomplexed subunit G excess was recovered. As for the previous MBP fusion protein isolation, this excess subunit G was cleared on an anion exchange column, and the complex was further purified by gel filtration. In this system, in which the complex forms within the cell, no subunit E was detected in the flow-through of the metal column. We have verified that the interaction between subunits E and G was not caused by some nonspecific effect mediated by the histidine tag by cleaving the latter with TEV protease. The product was recovered in the unbound supernatant of the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and contained the EG complex (Fig. 4). In addition, gel filtration analysis after cleavage of the histidine tag showed a single elution peak containing both subunits, indicating the integrity of the complex in the absence of the tag (data not shown). The EG complex isolated from this co-expression experiment had properties similar to those of the complex obtained from separate expression of the subunits.Fig. 4TEV cleavage of His-E/native-G complex expressed from the bicistronic vector.First lane, markers in kDa; second lane, His-E/native subunit G before cleavage; third lane, supernatant of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads incubated with the cleavage reaction (purified EG complex).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mass Characterization of the Recombinant Subunits—Gel filtration analysis of the retention times for the different protein species in comparison with globular protein markers is presented in Fig. 2B. It is observed that, using these markers, the estimated molecular weights do not agree with those calculated from the respective sequences. Both subunits E and G eluted earlier than expected, indicating high molecular weight oligomeric species of these subunits (Fig. 2B). The EG complex eluted before the respective monomers, confirming formation of the complex. Because the elution volume theoretically relates to the Stokes radius and not to the molecular size, one can hypothesize that the apparent size obtained from the retention times of the respective monomers is partly related to a difference in shape of the subunits rather than a true size difference. In accordance with this, both subunits E and G have been predicted to form long helices (20Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3357-3363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Supekova L. Sbia M. Supek F. Ma Y. Nelson N. J. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a shape that will make them behave quite differently from globular proteins on a gel filtration column.Cross-linking—Additional confirmation of the close interaction between subunits E and G came from cross-linking experiments. We have used three different cross-linkers differing in their arm length to generate covalent association between subunits E and G in the EG complex and have an idea of the proximity of the subunits. EDC in combination with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide is a zero length cross-linker reactive against amino and carboxylic groups. 1,5-Difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is a bifunctional hydrophobic compound with a 3-Å spacer arm, which preferentially reacts with amino groups, and Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate is bifunctional agent with an 11-Å arm reactive against the ϵ-amine of lysine. The results presented in Fig. 5 reveal the formation of a higher molecular weight common cross-linked product for all three cross-linkers. The appearance of this covalent species coincides with reduced staining of subunits E and G, and its mass corresponds to that of an expected EG complex. The identity of both subunits E and G on the gel was confirmed by MALDI analysis, and the same analysis of the isolated cross-linked complex indicated the presence of both subunits confirming the identification of the latter as an EG complex.Fig. 5Chemical cross-linking of the EG complex expressed from the bicistronic vector.Lane 1, molecular mass markers in kDa; lane 2, control (not cross-linked); lane 3, EDC/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-treated; lane 4, 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene-treated; lane 5, Bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate-treated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CD of Subunits and EG Complex—The secondary structure of the EG complex and the respective monomers were characterized by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The results presented in Fig. 6 show strong minima at 208 and 222 nm for subunit E, indicating a high helical content. However, the ratio of the molar ellipticities at 222 and 208 nm ([Θ]222/[Θ]208) is calculated to be significantly lower than 1 (0.84), which characterizes non-interacting helices (40Lau S.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2057808601,"The RecQ family of DNA helicases has been shown to be important for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Mutations in human RecQ genes lead to genomic instability and cancer. Several RecQ family of helicases contain a putative zinc finger motif of the C4 type at the C terminus that has been identified in the crystalline structure of RecQ helicase from Escherichia coli. To better understand the role of this motif in helicase from E. coli, we constructed a series of single mutations altering the conserved cysteines as well as other highly conserved residues. All of the resulting mutant proteins exhibited a high level of susceptibility to degradation, making functional analysis impossible. In contrast, a double mutant protein in which both cysteine residues Cys397 and Cys400 in the zinc finger motif were replaced by asparagine residues was purified to homogeneity. Slight local conformational changes were detected, but the rest of the mutant protein has a well defined tertiary structure. Furthermore, the mutant enzyme displayed ATP binding affinity similar to the wild-type enzyme but was severely impaired in DNA binding and in subsequent ATPase and helicase activities. These results revealed that the zinc finger binding motif is involved in maintaining the integrity of the whole protein as well as DNA binding. We also showed that the zinc atom is not essential to enzymatic activity. The RecQ family of DNA helicases has been shown to be important for the maintenance of genomic integrity.

The unwinding and separation of the individual strands of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is catalyzed by a class of specialized enzymes known as DNA helicases (1Lohman T.M. Bjornson K.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 169-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 2Soultanas P. Wigley D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These enzymes function as molecular motors that use the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to unwind and translocate along DNA in a sequential fashion (3Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 4Singleton M.R. Wentzell L.M. Liu Y. West S.C. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These ubiquitous enzymes have been identified in all living organisms from virus to human. It appears that they evolved from a common ancestor (6Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 867-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The RecQ helicase family is critical to the maintenance of genomic stability in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (7Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutations of RecQ genes can lead to genomic instability and several human diseases including the Bloom and Werner syndromes (8Furuichi Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the tumor suppressor BRCA1-associated protein, BACH1, which shares homologies with other members of the RecQ family, possesses ATPase and helicase activities (9Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The mutant BACH1 participates directly in breast and ovarian cancer development (9Cantor S. Drapkin R. Zhang F. Lin Y. Han J. Pamidi S. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The RecQ helicase from Escherichia coli is the prototype helicase of this family (10Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and has been shown to initiate homologous recombination as well as suppress illegitimate recombination (11Hanada K. Iwasaki M. Ihashi S. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5989-5994Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The RecQ helicase family members contain a helicase domain characterized by the presence of seven so-called “helicase” motifs necessary for using energy derived from ATP binding and hydrolysis to unwind DNA (13Bennett R.J. Keck J.L. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 79-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses revealed that all of the RecQ helicases contain a C-terminal extension that can be further divided into two domains (Fig. 1A): the HRDC domain (helicase and RNase D C-terminal), which functions as an auxiliary DNA-binding domain (15Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 16Liu Z. Macias M.J. Bottomley M.J. Stier G. Linge J.P. Nilges M. Bork P. Sattler M. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1557-1566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the RecQ C-terminal domain that contains a conserved CXnCXnCDXC motif (in which X is any amino acid) among the RecQ family of helicases (Fig. 1A) of which the function is still not clear. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of a C-terminal truncated form of RecQ helicase has revealed that the enzyme folds into four subdomains, two of which combine to form the helicase region, whereas the others form zinc binding (Fig. 1B) and winged-helix motifs (17Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The zinc atom is bound by four conserved cysteine residues located at a platform composed of α-helices17 and 18. The cysteine residue Cys380 (labeled as C1) is located at the beginning of the α-helix 17. Cys400 (labeled as C3) and Cys403 (labeled as C4) are at the beginning and the middle of the α-helix 18, respectively, whereas Cys397 (labeled as C2) is located in the loop linking the two helices (Fig. 1B). In addition, the zinc finger motif may be further stabilized by three hydrogen bonds formed among the conserved residues of phenylalanine (Phe374), arginine (Arg381), and asparagine (Asp401) (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have established that the zinc finger domains and other metal-binding protein domains are involved in diverse functions including protein-DNA interactions, protein folding, and protein-protein interactions (18Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). To elucidate the roles played by the zinc atom and the zinc finger motif in RecQ helicase, mutant RecQ molecules were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis within the zinc finger motif. Biochemical characterizations of these mutants showed that the zinc binding motif is essential to efficient DNA binding and stabilization of the three-dimensional structure of RecQ molecules. [α-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. 4-(2-Pyridylazo)resorcinol disodium salt (PAR), EDTA, 2-mercaptoethanol, ATP, and α-chymotrypsin were obtained from Sigma. Chelex® 100 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. The N-methylanthraniloyl derivatives of adenine nucleotides were synthesized according to Hiratsuka (19Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 719: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and purified on DEAE-cellulose using a gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate. Expression of Wild-type Enzyme and Construction of the Zinc Finger Mutant of RecQ Helicase—The E. coli RecQ helicase containing a N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickelchelating and anion-exchange chromatography as described previously (20Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C. Auclair C. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34925-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations were made by a two-step polymerase chain reaction method (21Iwaasa M. Umeda S. Ohsato T. Takamatsu C. Fukuoh A. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Hamasaki N. Kang D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The outside primers were QFN (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGTGAATGTGGCGCAGGCGGAAGTGTTG-3′) and QRX (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTACTCTTCGTCATCGCCATCAACATG-3′). The primers used to introduce mutations are QMF1 (5′-CAGGAGCCGAACGGGAACAACGATATCTGC-3′) and QMF2 (5′-GCAGATATCGTTGTTCCCGTTCGGCTCCTG-3′). The mutations resulting in coding changes are underlined. The mutant polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the 1.85-kb fragment was subcloned into pET-15b. Following the mutagenesis, the entire gene was sequenced to ensure that no additional mutations were created. The primers used to construct other mutants that could not be purified to homogeneity are not shown. Quantification of Zinc Ion Bound to E. coli RecQ Helicase—The zinc content of the wild-type and the zinc finger mutant of RecQ helicase was measured by the PAR assay as described by Hunt et al. (22Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). PAR has a low absorbance at 500 nm in the absence of zinc ion. However, in the presence of zinc ion, the absorbance at 500 nm increases dramatically due to the formation of the PAR2·Zn2+ complex. To more precisely quantify the zinc content of both wild-type and mutant helicases, all of the buffers were treated with Chelex 100 resin. The enzymes were dialyzed against the EDTA-free Chelex-treated buffer passed over a 10-cm column of Chelex-100 and reconcentrated. To facilitate zinc release, the enzymes (1 nmol in a volume of 20 μl) were first denatured with Chelex-treated 7 m guanidine HCl and then transferred to a 1-ml cuvette and the volume was adjusted to 0.9 ml with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). PAR was added into the cuvette for a final concentration of 100 μm. The absorbance at 500 nm was measured. The quantity of zinc ion was determined from a standard curve of ZnCl2 samples in a range of concentrations using the sample preparation procedure as described above with the RecQ helicase omitted. The zinc ion concentration was also determined using the absorbance coefficient for the (PAR)2·Zn2+ complex (ϵ500nm = 6.6 × 104m–1 cm–1). The zinc-demetalated RecQ helicase was obtained by dialysis of purified RecQ helicase against buffer B (10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) overnight at 4 °C (17Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were determined using Fluoro Max-2 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon, Spex Instruments S.A., Inc.) as described by Levin et al. (23Levin M.K. Gurjar M.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23311-23316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Some results were further confirmed by using PiStar-180 spectrometer (Applied Photophysics). In a 10 × 10 × 40-mm3 quartz cuvette, 0.5 μm RecQ protein in 1 ml of reaction buffer was excited at 280 nm and the fluorescence emission was monitored at 350 nm. mantATP binding to protein was measured by exciting the RecQ protein at 280 nm and measuring the fluorescence of mantATP at 440 nm because of FRET. The observed fluorescence intensity, Fobs, was corrected for inner filter and sample dilution effect according to Equation 1, F=Fobs×10[(AEX+AEM)/2]×V0+ViV0 (Eq. 1) where F is the corrected fluorescence intensity, V0 is the initial sample volume, Vi is the total volume of titrant added, and AEX and AEM are the absorbance values of the solution at excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The statistical thermodynamic model used to describe the ATP-RecQ complex formation is based on the observation that RecQ helicase has one ATP-binding site (17Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Therefore, the one-to-one binding model was used to establish the mantATP binding to RecQ. We have chosen the macroscopic interaction constant defined in Equation 2, Kd=[Ef][Df]/[C] (Eq. 2) where Ef represents the concentration of free enzyme, Df represents the concentration of free mantATP, Kd is the equilibrium interaction constant, and C is the concentration of the ATP-RecQ complex formed. The concentrations of total enzyme, ET, and total mantATP, DT, can be written in terms of Ef and Df as shown in Equations 3 and 4. ET=Ef+C (Eq. 3) DT=Df+C (Eq. 4) From Equations (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), the expression of C is obtained as shown in Equation 5. C=(DT+ET+Kd)−(DT+ET+Kd)2−4ETDT2 (Eq. 5) The value of Kd can be obtained by fitting the fluorescence intensity values to Equation 6, F=FS+fDDT+fCC (Eq. 6) where FS is the starting fluorescence of the reaction mixture, fD is the fluorescence coefficient of free mantATP, and fC is the fluorescence coefficient of complex formed. Limited Proteolytic Digestion—The wild-type, mutant, and Zn2+-extracted RecQ helicases at a concentration of 15 μm and in a total volume of 30 μl were digested with α-chymotrypsin (Sigma) for 2 and 10 min at room temperature. The ratio between the protease and RecQ was 1:100 for each helicase. Aliquots (15 μl corresponding to 1 μg of protein) from the reaction were quenched with 15 μl of gel-loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 3.4% SDS, 1.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The samples were boiled for 2 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel. Agarose Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (24Dou S.X. Wang P.Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 pmol (molecules) of the linearized DNA substrate (3 kb). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min on ice and was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (80% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). The complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gel in TAE (Tris-acetate-EDTA) buffer at 100 V for 1.5 h and were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. DNA Binding Assay under Equilibrium Condition—The binding of RecQ helicase to DNA was analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy using a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization spectrophotometer (PanVera) as described previously (24Dou S.X. Wang P.Y. Xu H.Q. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6354-6363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An appropriate quantity of fluorescein-labeled ssDNA or dsDNA was added to a standard titration buffer (150 μl of total volume) in a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 °C. The anisotropy of the fluorescein-labeled DNA was measured successively until it stabilized. An appropriate quantity of RecQ helicase then was added. The anisotropy then was measured continuously until it reached a stable plateau. To determine the concentration of the helicase-DNA complex, fluorescence signals observed in these RecQ helicase titrations were subtracted by those observed in the absence of enzyme. The increase in sample volume during the titration was taken into account in the analysis of the data. The reported values represent the averages of two to three measurements. The ssDNA used in this assay is a 36-mer 5′-fluorescein-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide (5′-F-AGACCCTTTTAGTCAGTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′). The dsDNA was generated with its complementary sequence (5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACACTGACTAAAAGGGTCT-3′). Circular Dichroism Analysis—All of the spectra were collected in buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) in a 0.2-mm cuvette at 20 °C on a Jobin-Yvon V dichrograph spectrophotometer. The protein samples were rigorously dialyzed against buffer C before measurement. All of the spectra were recorded with a 0.2-nm step as follows. Buffer C only was added to a single chamber, and the spectrum was recorded. The protein sample then was added to the same chamber, and the spectrum was recorded. The protein-only spectrum then was obtained by subtracting the free protein spectrum from the mixture spectrum. The measurement results are reported as mean residue ellipticity (θ) (degrees per square centimeter per decimole). The ATPase activity, helicase activity, and protein concentration were determined before and after each measurement. ATPase Assay and Determination of Ki for mantATP—The ATPase activity was determined in an assay by measuring the radioactive 32Pi liberated during hydrolysis (25Dessinges M.N. Lionnet T. Xi X.G. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6439-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The measurement was carried out at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing 1.5 μm (nucleotide) of heat-denatured HindIII-cut pGEM-7Zf linear DNA (3 kb) or ssDNA (60-mer) at the indicated concentration of ATP. The reactions were initiated by the addition of RecQ helicase into 100 μl of reaction mixture and stopped by pipetting 80 μl of aliquots from the reaction mixture every 30 s into a hydrochloric solution of ammonium molybdate. The liberated radioactive 32Pi was extracted with a solution of 2-butanol-benzene-acetoneammonium molybdate (750:750:15:1) saturated with water. An aliquot of the organic phase was counted in 6 ml of Aquasol. The competitive inhibition constant, Ki, for mantATP was determined by measuring the ATPase rate as a function of mantATP concentration and fit to Equation 7, v=[ATP]kcat[ATP]+KmATP(1+[mantATP]Ki) (Eq. 7) where v is the initial ATPase rate, kcat is the catalytic constant, and KATPm is the Km for ATP. Helicase Assay—An unwinding assay was performed using the Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization instrument (26Xu H.Q. Zhang A.H. Auclair C. Xi X.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). An appropriate quantity of fluorescein-labeled duplex oligonucleotide was added to the helicase-unwinding buffer (150 μl of total volumes) in a temperature-controlled cuvette. The anisotropy was measured successively until it stabilized. Helicase then was added. When the higher anisotropy value became stable, the unwinding reaction was initiated by the rapid addition of ATP solution to give a final ATP concentration of 1 mm. The decrease of the anisotropy was recorded every 8 s until it became stable. The unwinding buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm magnesium acetate, and 0.1 mm DTT. The data were fit to the exponential equation: A = A0exp(–kobst), where A is the anisotropy amplitude at time t, A0 is a constant, and kobs is the observed rate constant. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography was performed at 18 °C using an fast protein liquid chromatography system (ΔKTA, Amersham Biosciences) on a Superdex 200 (analytical grade) column equilibrated with elution buffer. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the absorbance was measured at 280 and 260 nm. The proteins used to prepare a calibration curve were as follows: thyroglobulin (bovine), 670 kDa; γ-globulin (bovine), 443 kDa; apoferritin, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; ovalbumin, 44 kDa; and myoglobin, 17 kDa. Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a standard elution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl at pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 1 mm ATP and 1 mm Mg(OAc)2.5 μm RecQ protein was incubated in the elution buffer with ATP and MgCl2 for 2 min prior to injection onto the column. Rationale for Site-directed Mutagenesis of the Zinc Finger Motif of RecQ Helicase—Site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore the functional significance of the putative zinc finger motif of the RecQ helicase. As shown in Fig. 1, six residues (Cys380, Arg381, Cys397, Cys400, Asp401, and Cys403) within this region are totally conserved among RecQ family members. Mutant RecQ enzymes were first engineered with single alanine or serine substitution at the position of each of the four cysteines. In addition, a careful analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme revealed that the conformation of the zinc finger motif is obviously stabilized through three hydrogen bonds among the highly conserved residues, Arg381, Asp401, and Phe374 (Fig. 1). These interactions may contribute to the relative positioning of the helices α16, α17, and α18 in the zinc finger motif (Fig. 1B). The residues Arg381 and Asp401 were thus replaced by asparagine and alanine, respectively. We found that all of these mutants displayed a high level of proteolysis and could not be purified to homogeneity, making functional studies impossible. To disturb mildly the zinc finger motif, we decided to simultaneously substitute C2 and C3 with asparagine. This residue was chosen, because its side chain could conceivably act as ligand to zinc ion (27Simpson R.J. Cram E.D. Czolij R. Matthews J.M. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28011-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, the single mutation with asparagine may have only a modest effect, whereas a double mutation should lead to a zinc finger motif that no longer binds to zinc ion. The expression analysis of these mutants shows that both single point mutants (C397N and C400N) became the inclusion body and could not be purified. However, ∼50% of the expressed double mutant RecQ helicase (C397N/C400N) is soluble and is purified to homogeneity. Based on Sypro Orangestained SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry analyses, the purity of this modified RecQ helicase was determined to be >92%. The ability of the purified double mutant enzyme to bind zinc was determined using the PAR assay. Although 0.98 mol of zinc were bound to 1 mol of the wild-type protein, only 0.02 mol of zinc was bound to 1 mol of the double mutant enzyme (Table I). These results are consistent with both the prediction from the primary amino acid sequence and the study of the three-dimensional structure of RecQ helicase, indicating that the enzyme contains a functional zinc-binding domain.Table IComparison of the basic properties of wild-type, double mutant, and zinc-demetalated helicasesHelicase[Zn2+]/[protein]Stokes radiusCatalysisaDetermined from Fig. 4.DNA bindingbDetermined from Fig. 5B.

Open table in a new tab To assess whether zinc ion is required for RecQ helicase function, zinc ion was extracted from wild-type enzyme by extensive dialysis against the dialysis solution (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol) containing 15 mm EDTA. The obtained zinc-extracted wild-type helicase was termed zinc-demetalated RecQ helicase. Therefore, three preparations of enzymes were used for the following studies: the wild-type helicase; the double mutant helicase; and the zinc-demetalated helicases. Structural Characterization of the Mutant Protein—It is well established that metal ions have important effects on secondary structure formation. We were wondering whether the purified double mutant RecQ helicase (C397N/C400N) has a normal structure. We first performed CD studies to check the effect of mutation on the secondary structure of the protein. The replacement of both cysteines with asparagines leads to a subtle modification in the secondary structure of RecQ helicase as judged from the CD spectra (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the double mutation induced slightly a local conformational change. In contrast, no significant CD spectra change was observed with the zinc-demetalated RecQ helicase. We next performed the limited proteolysis experiments on wild-type, mutant, and zinc-demetalated helicases under the same experimental conditions. Fig. 2B shows that both mutant and zinc-demetalated proteins display similar proteolysis-resistant patterns as the wild-type RecQ helicase, suggesting that the three proteins assume similar structures. These results have been further confirmed by size-exclusion chromatographic studies. Because both ultracentrifugation analyses and three-dimensional structure studies have shown that RecQ helicase takes a globular shape (17Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 20Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C. Auclair C. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34925-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the apparent molecular masses of wild-type, double mutant, and zinc-demetalated helicases were used to estimate their Stokes radii, thus determining their overall spherical shapes. As shown in Table I, these helicases have similar Stokes radii. Taken together, these results indicate that these enzymes (wild-type, double mutant, and zinc-demetalated helicases) possess similar three-dimensional structures. Zinc Finger Motif Is Not Required for ATP Binding—We next studied the binding of ATP to the double mutant using a fluorescent nucleotide analogue (Fig. 3A, mantATP). The spectral properties of the mant fluorophore are ideally suited for monitoring nucleotide binding by FRET from the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of RecQ to the mant fluorophore bound at the ATP-binding site. The comparison between the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of RecQ and those of mantATP showed that the emission spectrum of RecQ overlaps with the excitation spectrum of mantATP (Fig. 3B), indicating the possibility of FRET. Although the three-dimensional structure of RecQ helicase has shown that the enzyme has only one ATP-binding site, we want to first determine whether mantATP binds to the same ATP-binding site of RecQ. For this purpose, the competitive inhibition constant, Ki, for mantATP was determined by measuring the ATPase rate of the helicase as a function of mantATP concentration (Fig. 3C). The data were fit to a competitive inhibition equation with a Ki of 85 μm, indicating that mantATP binds competitively to the ATP-binding site. The apparent Kd values for the wild-type, double mutant, and zinc-demetalated helicases were measured using standard fluorimetric titration methods. From the titration curves as shown in Fig. 3D, the apparent Kd values determined are 43.6 μm for the wild-type helicase, 56.8 μm for the double mutant helicase, and 47.6 μm for the zinc-demetalated helicase, revealing that neither the zinc finger nor zinc ion is essential to ATP binding. This study sheds light not only on ATP binding but also on folding of the mutant protein. The fact that the double mutant protein binds ATP normally indicates that the overall three-dimensional structure of the double mutant was not altered. It is also interesting to no"

Stat3 controls cell death and tissue remodeling in the mouse mammary gland during involution, which is partially induced by IL6 and LIF. However, it is not clear whether Stat3 activation is mediated solely through the gp130 pathway or also through other receptors. This question was explored in mice carrying two distinct mutations in the gp130 gene; one that resulted in the complete ablation of gp130 and one that led to the loss of Stat3 binding sites (gp130Δ/Δ). Deletion of gp130 specifically from mammary epithelium resulted in a complete loss of Stat3 activity and resistance to tissue remodeling comparable to that seen in the absence of Stat3. A less profound delay of mammary tissue remodeling was observed in gp130Δ/Δ mice. Stat3 tyrosine and serine phosphorylation was still detected in these mice suggesting that Stat3 activation could be the result of gp130 interfacing with other receptors. Experiments in primary mammary epithelial cells and transfected COS-7 cells revealed a p44/42 MAPK and EGFR-dependent Stat3 activation. Moreover, the gp130-dependent EGFR activation was independent of EGF ligands, suggesting a cytoplasmic interaction and cross-talk between these two receptors.

Targeted disruption of the gp130 gene in mice causes thinning of ventricular myocardium, reduction of hematopoietic stem cells and structural and functional defects in the placenta, which results in embryonic lethality (7Yoshida K.

While IL6 family cytokine-induced Stat3 activation is dependent on gp130 and Janus kinases (Jak), Jak-independent activation can be accomplished through the EGFR that possesses an endogenous tyrosine kinase and the ability to activate several other intracellular tyrosine kinases (18Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I.

Toward this end, two mouse mutants were employed. In one mouse model, the entire gp130 gene was inactivated in mammary epithelium using Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. In the other model, a truncated mutation of the C terminus of gp130 (gp130Δ/Δ) was introduced as the Y765F, Q768A, and 769stop substitutions (20Ernst M. Inglese M. Waring P. Campbell I.K. Bao S.

This resulted in the loss of the four Stat3 binding sites (Tyr765,812,904,914). However, the SHP2 and Jak2 binding sites were intact, and therefore the emanating signals were functional in this mutant. The physiological lesions imposed by the loss of Stat3 signaling through the gp130Δ/Δ receptor (20Ernst M. Inglese M. Waring P. Campbell I.K. Bao S. Clay F.J. Alexander W.S. Wicks I.P. Tarlinton D.M.

Subsequently mammary tissue (normally 3-5 cells in a cluster) was suspended in complete DMEM with insulin (10 μg/ml) and EGF (10 ng/ml), and seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells were left undisturbed for a week. The medium was changed to serum-free DMEM for 24 h, and the cells were treated with IL6 (10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, PeproTech), IL6 with U0126 (10 μm, Biomol), and AG1478 (3 μm, Biomol) for 15 min before harvesting for protein extraction. Cells were lysed using the lysis buffer described previously, and immunoprecipitation and Western blot were performed using standard procedures.COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Briefly, for transient transfections in 6-cm dishes the cells were incubated for 24 h with the transfection mix containing 15 μl of Polyfect and 2 μg of total plasmid DNA per dish. Cells were washed and cultured in serum-free medium for another 24 h prior to IL6 stimulation. Cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4,10mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (HNTG). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 100 μl of lysates were immunoprecipitated using EGFR antibodies (108.1) (30Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 3 min, and subjected to gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. Phosphotyrosine was detected using the 4G10 monoclonal antibody (Upstate). Polyclonal anti-phospho-p44/p42 (Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK antibody, anti-phospho-Stat3, and Stat3 antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal anti-p44/42 MAPK antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Statistics—Western blot bands were quantified using Alpha image 2000 v4 software. Three independent experiments were used to quantitate the data for analysis. All bands were normalized to actin or unphosphorylated total protein. Data are shown as mean ± S.E., and a Student's t test was used to compare two groups of samples.RESULTSLIF Contributes to Mammary Epithelial Cell Death during Involution but Does Not Influence Mammary Development—The level of LIF expression increases sharply at the onset of involution (12Zhao L. Melenhorst J.J. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2902-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and its role in mammary epithelial cell death and tissue remodeling was therefore investigated. Since LIF-null mice are infertile, mammary tissue was transplanted into wild-type hosts and analyzed after puberty, during pregnancy and involution. In virgin mice, no histological differences were detected between wild type (Fig. 1A, panel a) and LIF-null (Fig. 1A, panel d) mammary tissue 8 weeks after transplantation. A ductal tree filled the entire fat pad and exhibited extensive branching. Analysis of bona fide LIF-null mice during puberty revealed an abnormal branching (Fig. 1A, panels b and e), and the effect was abolished upon transplantation (Fig. 1A, panels a and d). Moreover, similar morphology was observed during pregnancy in wild type and null transplanted tissue (Fig. 1A, panels c and f). This suggests that the lesion resulted from systemic or stromal effects in LIF-null mice.To explore the contribution of LIF in the remodeling process, tissue was analyzed at parturition and days 1-6 of involution. No obvious differences were noted at parturition (Fig. 1B, panels a and e) and days 1 and 2 of involution (data not shown). However, from day 3-6 LIF-null tissue (Fig. 1B, panels f-h) retained more alveoli, and the reappearance of the stroma was delayed. Histological differences between LIF-null and wild-type mammary tissues were observed until day 6 of involution (Fig. 1B, panels d and h). Less nuclear Stat3 staining was observed in LIF-null tissue (Fig. 1C).In addition to LIF and IL6, expression of OSM, another IL6 family cytokine, was also detected in mammary tissue. OSM expression in involuting glands peaked at 24 h and was absent in lactating glands (data not shown). This suggests that OSM may also be involved in mammary tissue remodeling.Inactivation of the gp130 Gene in Mammary Epithelium—To examine the contribution of the receptor subunit gp130 in the remodeling of mammary epithelium and in the activation of Stat3, we analyzed mice with two distinct mutations in the gp130 gene. One strain expressed a gp130 with a truncated C-terminal region, and in the other strain the entire gene was inactivated.Deletion of Stat3 Binding Sites in gp130—The gp130 gene in gp130Δ/Δ mice carries a knockin mutation (20Ernst M. Inglese M. Waring P. Campbell I.K. Bao S. Clay F.J. Alexander W.S. Wicks I.P. Tarlinton D.M. Novak U. Heath J.K. Dunn A.R. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) that results in a C-terminal truncation at amino acid 769 and a loss of all proposed Stat3 binding sites (31Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Since these mice are infertile mammary tissue was transplanted into wild-type recipients, and the ability of the cells to develop during pregnancy and subsequently engage in remodeling was examined. While pregnancy-induced mammary development was normal (data not shown), involution was delayed (Fig. 2A). Wild-type tissue at day 3 of involution had undergone extensive remodeling (Fig. 2A, panel b) but mutant mammary tissue continued to display distended alveoli with evidence of milk secretion (Fig. 2A, panel e). The levels of milk protein WAP and apoptosis-related protein SGP2 also confirmed the delayed involution (Fig. 2B). However, this delay of remodeling was transient and full involution was eventually achieved. The levels of Stat3 and MAPK activation in gp130Δ/Δ tissue was examined by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylated Stat3 was still present in mutant tissue, while phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK appeared to be lower (Fig. 2B). This suggests that Stat3 can be activated in mammary tissue through pathways that are independent of the known Stat3 binding sites in gp130. This possibly occurs through activation by the LIFR, which dimerizes with gp130Δ/Δ.Fig. 2A, histology of mammary transplants from wt (panels a-c) and gp130Δ/Δ (panels d-f) mammary tissues at day 1 (i1-a, d), day 3 (i3-b, e), and day 4 (i4-c, f) of involution.

Melenhorst J.J. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2902-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To fully understand the gp130-activated signals in mammary tissue remodeling it was therefore necessary to inactivate the entire protein. Mice were generated that carried loxP sites in the promoter of the gp130 gene and in intron II. 2J. Cheng and C. Stewart, unpublished data. This permitted the complete inactivation of the gene through Cre-mediated recombination. The gp130 gene was specifically inactivated in differentiating mammary epithelium during pregnancy using the WAP-Cre transgene (23Wagner K.U. Wall R.J. St-Onge L. Gruss P. Wynshaw-Boris A. Garrett L.

Mammary tissue was analyzed from gp130 fl/fl;WC mice after one and several pregnancies by Western blots and histology analysis. Greatly reduced levels of gp130 were observed in gp130 fl/fl;WC mice (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). The residual signal was due to the stromal compartment of the gland in which the WAP-Cre transgene is not active. The levels of phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK were lower after two pregnancies, and after five pregnancies both the total amount and phosphorylated form of p44/42 MAPK were reduced (Fig. 3A, p < 0.05) compared with fl/fl mice.Fig. 3A, Western blot analysis of gp130 protein after 1 (P1), 2 (P2), and 5 (P5) pregnancies in gp130 fl/fl (fl/fl) and gp130 fl/fl;WC (fl/fl;WC) mammary tissues. The level of gp130 protein is lower in all fl/fl;WC samples compared with fl/fl tissue (p < 0.05). p-p44/42 MAPK level is also lower after two pregnancies in fl/fl;WC tissue compared with that of the fl/fl tissue. *, p < 0.05.

In order to obtain extensive inactivation of the gp130 gene, gp130 fl/fl;WC mice were taken through two pregnancies, followed by the analysis of mammary tissue during involution. In these mice involution and the associated tissue remodeling was greatly impaired (Fig. 3B), and the glands had a secretory appearance even 2 weeks after weaning (Fig. 3C, panels b and d). Immunofluorescence confirmed the absence of gp130 in gp130 fl/fl;WC (Fig. 4A) tissue and its presence in fl/fl (Fig. 4D) mammary tissue.

In Bacillus subtilis, thiamin is biosynthesized by the coupling of 4-methyl-5-(β-hydroxyethyl)thiazole phosphate and 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP) (Fig. 1) (1Begley T.P.

A phosphorylation catalyzed by ThiL provides the active cofactor TPP. The known genes related to thiamin metabolism (Fig. 1) were identified through genetic analysis of thiamin-requiring mutants. This approach is limited because essential genes cannot be detected. In addition, no genes responsible for thiamin degradation have been identified in Escherichia coli and B. subtilis. Here, we describe a genetic screen aimed at identifying additional genes involved in thiamin metabolism. A common strategy for identifying antibiotic targets encoded in a plasmid library exploits the fact that overexpression of the target induces antibiotic resistance. For instance, recombinant cells with increased doses of murZ, the E. coli gene encoding UDP-GlcNAc enolpyruvate transferase, displayed phosphomycin resistance (8Marquardt J.L. Siegele D.A. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clones resistant to thiolactomycin were found to contain increased levels of fabB, which encodes β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase I, the cellular target of thiolactomycin (9Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased levels of prolipoprotein signal peptidase rendered cells resistant to globomycin, a specific inhibitor of that enzyme (10Tokunaga M. Loranger J.M. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12102-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other selections have been used to identify proteins that could either detoxify an antibiotic or reverse the effects of the toxin (11Lomouskaya O. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8938-8942Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Missiakas D. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7084-7088Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our selection strategy utilizes the HMP analogs bacimethrin and4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine(CF3-HMP) (Fig. 1), both of which inhibit E. coli cell growth with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the low micromolar range. A recent study demonstrated that the thiamin biosynthetic enzymes convert bacimethrin to 2′-methoxythiamin pyrophosphate (MeO-TPP), which inhibits thiamin-utilizing enzymes (13Reddick J.J. Saha S. Lee J.-M. Melnick J.S. Perkins J. Begley T.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the presence of low levels of exogenous thiamin, cell growth is not inhibited by bacimethrin (14Drautz H. Messerer W. Zahner H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Zilles J.L. Croal L.R. Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5606-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CF3-HMP is converted by HMP-P kinase (ThiD) to CF3-HMP pyrophosphate (CF3-HMP-PP), which inhibits thiamin phosphate synthase (ThiE) (16Reddick J.J. Nicewonger R. Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10095-10102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Increased levels of biosynthesized thiamin should overcome growth inhibition caused by CF3-HMP. Enzymes that degrade TPP and its biosynthetic precursors will likely display similar activity toward MeO-TPP and CF3-HMP-PP and thereby detoxify the antibiotics. Thus, selection against bacimethrin and CF3-HMP toxicity should uncover genes involved in thiamin biosynthesis and degradation. Selection of Clones from the Genomic Libraries—The E. coli MG1655 genomic library was constructed by ligating fragments (2.5–5.0 kb) from mechanically sheared DNA into the SmaI site of pBAD18 (17Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3923) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid library was transformed into E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen). Approximately 30,000 colony-forming units were plated onto medium A (E salts, 0.2% glycerol, 40 μg/ml each natural amino acid, 0.2% arabinose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 1.25 mm Na4P207) containing either 8 μm bacimethrin (18Perandones F. Soto J.L. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1998; 35: 413-419Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or 50 μm CF3-HMP (19Barone J.A. Peters E. Tieckelmann H. J. Org. Chem. 1959; 24: 198-200Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After 20 h of incubation at 37 °C, visible colonies were amplified by transfer to liquid medium (LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin). MIC values for each resistant clone were determined by streaking the cells on medium A containing various concentrations of bacimethrin or CF3-HMP and incubating the plates for 12 h at 37 °C. The B. subtilis genomic library was constructed by ligating fragments (∼3 kb) from mechanically sheared DNA into the SacI site of pGEM-3Z. The resulting plasmid library was transformed into E. coli DH10B (Invitrogen). Selection of resistant clones and MIC determinations were carried out as described above. Assays for Phosphatase Activity—Assay mixtures of 100 μl total volume contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm HMP-PP or TPP, and 1 mg of protein/ml of cell-free extract from ymfB or cof overexpression strains (described in supplemental material). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and protein was removed by filtration through a Microcon 10 membrane (Millipore). 30 μl of the filtered reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-18-T analytical column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm) using the following gradient: 0 min, 100% A (0.1 m K2HPO4 pH 6.6); 6 min, 100% A; 7 min, 90% A, 10% B (methanol); 20 min, 40% A, 30% B, 30% C (water). Elution was carried out at 1 ml/min and monitored at 254 nm. Under these conditions the following retention times were observed: HMP-PP (2.3 min), HMP-P (2.7 min), MeO-HMP-PP (2.8 min), MeO-HMP-P (4.0 min), CF3-HMP-PP (4.2 min), 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate (6.6 min), TPP (9.3 min), thiamin monophosphate (11.7 min), HMP (12.7 min), thiamin (12.9 min), MeO-TPP (12.1 min), and 2′-methoxythiamin monophosphate (12.5 min). Preparation of the substrates is described in supplemental material. For competition experiments to determine relative rates of hydrolysis, assays were carried out as described above, except equimolar amounts (∼0.4 mm each) of the two substrates were used in the assay. (V1/K1)/(V2/K2) was calculated as the ratio of products at 5–25% conversion divided by the ratio of substrates at 0% conversion. Selection of Clones Resistant to Bacimethrin or CF3-HMP—We screened a genomic library of E. coli MG1655 constructed in a multicopy plasmid for clones resistant to 8 μm bacimethrin or 50 μm CF3-HMP. Ten resistant colonies were isolated from the bacimethrin-containing plates, and two resistant colonies were isolated from the CF3-HMP-containing plates. A similar B. subtilis genomic library yielded 1 clone resistant to 50 μm CF3-HMP and 3 clones resistant to 8 μm bacimethrin. The MICs of both antibiotics for each isolated clone were determined (Table I). Plasmids were isolated from the resistant clones, and the genomic inserts were partially sequenced. The resulting sequences were localized on the E. coli or B. subtilis genome sequence (Table I).Table ICharacterization of resistant clones isolated from plates containing bacimethrin or CF3-HMPCloneaClones 10, 11, and 15 were isolated from the CF3-HMP screen.

We confirmed that the ymfB, yajO, yjjX, and cof overexpression strains could grow in the presence of either bacimethrin (50 μm) or CF3-HMP (50 μm). Furthermore, thiC and dxs overexpression strains from our collection were also resistant to the antibiotic activity of these compounds.

This suggested the possibility that these proteins might detoxify bacimethrin and CF3-HMP by catalyzing hydrolysis of CF3-HMP-PP and MeO-TPP, the previously identified toxic forms of the antibiotics (13Reddick J.J.

HPLC analysis of reaction mixtures containing HMP-PP and either Cof or YmfB showed that both of these enzymes catalyzed the hydrolysis of HMP-PP to HMP-P (Fig. 4). YmfB also catalyzes hydrolysis of TPP to thiamin monophosphate (Fig. 5).Fig. 4HPLC analysis of reactions containing HMP-PP and cell-free extract from BL21 (DE3) (top), the cof overexpression strain (middle), or the ymfB overexpression strain (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 5HPLC analysis of reactions containing TPP and cell-free extract from BL21(DE3) (top) or the ymfB overexpression strain (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further assays showed that MeO-HMP-PP and CF3-HMP-PP are also substrates for Cof, and that MeO-HMP-PP, CF3-HMP-PP, and MeO-TPP are substrates for YmfB (data not shown). The rates of enzymatic hydrolysis of HMP-PP versus MeO-HMP-PP or CF3-HMP-PP were determined by competition experiments. Relative V/K values were determined by analysis of the product ratios after pure YmfB or cell-free extract from the cof overexpression strain was incubated with a mixture of HMP-PP and either MeO-HMP-PP or CF3-HMP-PP. MeO-HMP-PP is hydrolyzed 4.5 ± 0.3 times faster than HMP-PP, and CF3-HMP-PP is hydrolyzed 2.25 ± 0.04 times faster than HMP-PP by YmfB. CF3-HMP-PP is hydrolyzed 2.2 ± 0.2 times faster than HMP-PP, and MeO-HMP-PP is hydrolyzed 2.8 ± 0.2 times faster than HMP-PP by Cof. A similar analysis indicated that YmfB displays no selectivity for MeO-TPP over TPP. Functional Analysis of yajO, yjjX, and yveN—We suspected that YajO, YjjX, and YveN might also degrade TPP or its related metabolites. However, HPLC analysis of mixtures containing YajO, YjjX, and YveN incubated with TPP, thiamin monophosphate, thiamin, HMP-PP, HMP-P, or HMP indicated that no reaction had occurred. As the biosynthesis of HMP is not biochemically well defined, we considered that YajO, YjjX, and YveN may be involved in HMP formation. However, when these proteins were added to our recently developed in vitro HMP biosynthesis reaction mixture, no effect was observed (26Lawhorn B.G. Mehl R.A. Begley T.P. Org. & Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 2538-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We set out to identify genes involved in thiamin metabolism by screening E. coli and B. subtilis genomic libraries for genes that conferred resistance to the antibiotics bacimethrin and CF3-HMP. Our selection strategy was based on the hypothesis that overexpression of thiamin biosynthetic genes would increase cellular levels of thiamin and result in antibiotic resistance. Alternatively, overexpression of thiamin-degrading genes would likely cause degradation of the active forms of the antibiotics. We identified 16 unique resistant clones. Sequencing of these clones revealed that five different regions of the E. coli genome were represented, whereas three different regions of the B. subtilis genome were represented (Table I). We reasoned that increased levels of ymfB must confer resistance to bacimethrin and CF3-HMP because it is intact on plasmids 1, 2, and 3. thiC must be responsible for the antibiotic resistance observed in clones 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 because it is the only intact gene present on the plasmids carried by clones 4, 8, and 9. yjjX is likely the gene responsible for bacimethrin and CF3-HMP resistance in clones 10 and 11 because trpR (Trp regulator) and gpmB (phosphoglycerate mutase) are unlikely to be involved in thiamin biosynthesis or in the detoxification of these antibiotics. For clone 12, cof is most likely the gene responsible for resistance because cof is up-regulated in response to CF3-HMP. 2J. Perkins and T. P. Begley, unpublished data. In clones 13 and 14, either dxs or yajO could be the gene responsible for the observed antibiotic resistance. thiE is the cellular target for CF3-HMP, which explains the behavior of clone 15. Finally, yveN is the only intact gene of clone 16, and thus must be responsible for the bacimethrin resistance of this clone. This analysis was confirmed by demonstrating the increased antibiotic resistance of the thiC, thiE, dxs, yjjX, yajO, cof, ymfB, and yveN overexpression strains. We predicted that our screen would uncover genes involved in thiamin biosynthesis. The identification of the known thiamin biosynthetic genes thiC, thiE, and dxs on 9 of the isolated clones supported this hypothesis. An alternative possibility was that resistance could occur by detoxifying bacimethrin and CF3-HMP. Because ymfB and cof both contain hydrolase motifs, we considered the possibility that the detoxification of bacimethrin and CF3-HMP might occur by the hydrolysis of their phosphorylated metabolites. This hypothesis was confirmed by demonstrating that YmfB and Cof catalyzed the hydrolysis of MeO-HMP-PP and CF3-HMP-PP to give MeO-HMP-P and 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate. This hydrolysis generates resistance to the antibiotics by reducing the formation of their toxic forms, MeO-TPP and CF3-HMP-PP (13Reddick J.J. Saha S. Lee J.-M. Melnick J.S. Perkins J. Begley T.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2245-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Reddick J.J. Nicewonger R. Begley T.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10095-10102Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cof and YmfB selectively hydrolyze MeO-HMP-PP over HMP-PP with selectivities of 2.8 and 4.5, respectively, and Cof and YmfB hydrolyze CF3-HMP-PP over HMP-PP with selectivities of 2.2 and 2.3, respectively. It is notable that YmfB also catalyzes the hydrolysis of TPP and MeO-TPP. MeO-TPP hydrolysis is much slower than the hydrolysis of MeO-HMP-PP, and there is no selectivity for MeO-TPP hydrolysis over TPP hydrolysis. The mechanisms by which yjjX, yajO, and yveN elicit resistance to bacimethrin and CF3-HMP are yet to be determined. YajO, YjjX, and YveN do not affect the biosynthesis of HMP. As the remaining steps of bacterial thiamin biosynthesis are biochemically well defined, it is unlikely that YajO, YjjX, or YveN are thiamin biosynthetic enzymes. In addition, these proteins have no apparent activity toward thiamin or its biosynthetic precursors. It is possible that these proteins are cellular targets of bacimethrin and CF3-HMP or that they promote efflux of the antibiotics (8Marquardt J.L. Siegele D.A. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tokunaga M. Loranger J.M. Wu H.C.

The genetic screen described here is based on the resistance of clones isolated from E. coli and B. subtilis genomic libraries to antibiotics that inhibit thiamin biosynthesis and utilization. This is a powerful approach that resulted in the isolation of five genes involved in thiamin metabolism. Three of these genes (thiC, thiE, dxs) had been previously identified as thiamin biosynthetic genes (2Begley T.P. Downs D. Ealick S. McLafferty F. van Loon D. Taylor S. Campobasso N. Chiu H.-J. Kinsland C. Reddick J. Xi. J. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 171: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Two new genes (cof, ymfB) are involved in the hydrolysis of HMP-PP and TPP. Three additional genes (yajO, yjjX, yveN) that were isolated are still without functional assignment. Provided suitable inhibition can be identified, this approach should be generally useful for the identification of natural product biosynthetic genes (8Marquardt J.L. Siegele D.A. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tsay J.-T. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 508-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tokunaga M.

Until now, it has been assumed that cellular TPP concentration is controlled by thiamin-mediated repression of the translation of key thiamin biosynthetic genes (2Begley T.P. Downs D. Ealick S.

However, our studies on Cof and YmfB demonstrate that E. coli contains enzymes able to catalyze the hydrolysis of TPP and HMP-PP. The physiological significance of these results is undetermined, and the possibility that Cof and YmfB can catalyze the hydrolysis of other metabolites cannot be excluded. Our results have allowed us to assign a possible function to two genes of previously unassigned function, and the results suggest that degradation of TPP and its biosynthetic precursors may play an important role in controlling intracellular concentrations of this cofactor.

However, the precise identity of SMPP-1M-associated kinase remains unclear. Biochemical evidence strongly supports the idea that SMPP-1M-associated kinase is related to the human serine/threonine leucine zipper-interacting protein kinase (hZIPK), which is important in cell apoptosis, and the SMPP-1M-associated kinase has therefore been called ZIP-like kinase (MacDonald, J.

Whether the vascular smooth muscle SMPP-1M-associated kinase is a truncated version of hZIPK, native hZIPK, or a unique homologue of hZIPK is unclear. Here we show that only native hZIPK mRNA and protein are detectable in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). High stringency screening of a human aortic cDNA library for the SMPP-1M-associated kinase identified 18 positive clones, all of which proved to be clones of hZIPK. PCR-based studies of VSMC RNA revealed native hZIPK transcripts but no evidence for splice variants of hZIPK or a ZIP-like kinase. Northern blotting studies of multiple vascular and non-vascular tissue RNAs, including human bladder RNA, showed only 2.3 kb of mRNA predicted for full-length hZIPK. Immunoblotting showed native full-length 52-kDa hZIPK expression in VSMCs. Full-length and N-terminal hZIPK bound the C-terminal domain (amino acids 681-847) of the myosin binding subunit (MBS) of SMPP-1M. hZIPK immunoprecipitated with the MBS of SMPP-1M and dominant negative RhoA inhibited the hZIPK-MBS interaction. These data identify hZIPK as the unique SMPP-1-associated kinase expressed in human vesicular smooth muscle and support a role for Rho in promoting the hZIPK-MBS interaction.

Contraction and relaxation of VSMCs is determined by the phosphorylation state of myosin light chains (MLCs), a process that is tightly regulated by the opposing activities of myosin light chain kinase and myosin phosphatase (SMPP-1M) (1Hartshorne D.J.

RhoA, when activated by vasoconstrictors, binds and activates its effector Rho-kinase, which leads to SMPP-1M phosphorylation (13Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B.

The SMPP-1M-associated kinase phosphorylates the myosin binding subunit (MBS) of SMPP-1M and inhibits SMPP-1M activity. As recent data support the physiologic importance of SMPP-1M regulation, attention has focused on identification of the SMPP-1M-associated kinase(s). Recently, MacDonald et al. identified a SMPP-1M-associated kinase and named it ZIP-like kinase. ZIP-like kinase was isolated from bladder smooth muscle as a 32-Da phosphoprotein that co-purified with SMPP-1M, phosphorylated SMPP-1M at inhibitory residues, and was activated by the smooth muscle contractile agonist carbachol (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of ZIP-like kinase into rabbit ileal smooth muscle led to calcium-independent contractions (20Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite data supporting a physiological role for a ZIP-like kinase in smooth muscle, the precise identity of this kinase and its presence and function in VSMCs remains unclear. Sequencing of ZIP-like kinase-derived peptides revealed high homology to the 52-kDa zipper-interacting protein kinase (hZIPK), raising the possibility that ZIP-like kinase could be a splice variant of hZIPK, a separate kinase with high homology to hZIPK, or a degradation product of hZIPK (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). hZIPK was identified originally as a protein involved in programmed cell death that interacts with the transcription factor ATF4 and mediates apoptosis when overexpressed (21Kawai T. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Sanjo H. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). hZIPK has also been shown to have a potential role in regulating VSMC contraction. hZIPK was found to phosphorylate MLC at both Ser19 and Thr18 in a calcium-independent manner, leading to cell contraction (22Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29567-29574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The following study was initiated to determine the precise identity of the PP1M-associated kinase(s) in VSMCs. Through a combination of mRNA and protein analysis, we have found evidence to strongly support the proposition that “ZIP-like kinase” in VSMCs is actually derived from hZIPK, which is present in VSMCs and interacts with SMPP-1M in a RhoA-regulated manner. Antibodies—Sources of antibodies were as follows. The rabbit polyclonal anti-ZIP kinase (amino acids 279-298) was from Calbiochem, the anti-FLAG-M2 antibody was from Sigma, the anti-myosin phosphatase polyclonal antibody came from Covance (Berkeley, CA), and normal mouse IgG and normal rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Immortalized aorta smooth muscle cells, coronary smooth muscle cells, pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and radial artery smooth muscle cells were developed in our laboratory from human tissues by the explant method. These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. HEK293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Plasmids—To generate plasmids expressing hZIPK, cDNA-fragments were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction from pACT2 (Clontech) containing hZIPK fragments and cloned into pT7Blue-3 (Novagen, Madison, WI). pT7Blue3-hZIPK was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and the fragments were cloned into the pFLAG-CMV4 vector (Sigma). GST fusion proteins of full-length and C-terminal hZIPK were generated as follows. DNA fragments corresponding to full-length and C-terminal hZIPK were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs of 5′-GGGAATTCTATGTCCACGTTCAGGCAGGAG-3′ (5′) and 5′-GGGTCGACCTAGCGCAGCCCGCACTCCACG-3′ (3′) for the former and 5′-GGGAATTCAGCGGCCGCAAGCCCGAGCGGC-3′ (5′) and 5′-GGGTCGACCTAGCGCAGCCCGCACTCCACG-3′ (3′) for the latter. The PCR products were cloned into pT7Blue-3 and digested with EcoRI and SalI. These fragments were cloned into pGEX4T-3 and pGEX4T-1 vectors (Amersham Biosciences). To generate the plasmid expressing the GSTN-terminal region of hZIPK, NotI-digested pGEX4T-3 hZIPK was treated with a Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to blunt the ends, followed by self-ligation. pEF-BOS-mouse ZIPK was a gift from S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14376-14381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) expression vectors were derived from pCAGGS and contain the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and the coding region of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at the 3′-end of the multiple cloning site. The cDNA fragments encoding the small GTPase RhoA, RhoN19 (dominant negative form), and RhoQ63L (constitutively active form) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pCXN2-IRES-EGFP. Human Aorta cDNA Library Screening—A human aorta cDNA library containing 3.5 × 106 independent clones (Clontech) was screened by the colony hybridization technique (24Grunstein M. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3961-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled EcoRI-NotI fragments of hZIPK cDNA were made from the cDNA clone AI660136 (Genome System) encoding the N terminus of hZIPK and used as a probe. The library was transferred to Hybond N synthetic nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and then pre-hybridized and hybridized in 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSC, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA under high (hybridization temperature 65 °C) and low (hybridization temperature 58 °C) stringency conditions. Polymerase Chain Reaction—PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl of reaction mix containing 0.2 mm each dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, PCR buffer without magnesium, 0.25 μm each primer for the investigation of ZIPK splice variants, 500 μm each primer for degenerate PCR, and 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Reaction mixtures were heated for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 30 cycles of amplification. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing between 38 and 57 °C, and extension at 70 °C between 1 and 3 min. After the last cycle, samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 70 °C. The following primers were designed for the investigation of hZIPK splice variants: primer 1, 5′-AGGCGCGTCGCGGCGGCAGGGGCG-3′ (3′) and 5′-CTTCAGGTCAAAGTGTGCGATGCG-3′ (5′); primer 2, 5′-AGGCGCGTCGCGGCGGCAGGGGCG-3′ (3′) and 5′-GGATATAGGTGATGACACCGA-3′ (5′); primer 3, 5′-AGGCGCGTCGCGGCGGCAGGGGCG-3′ (3′) and 5′-GCTCGGGCTTGCGGCCGCTG-3′ (5′); primer 4, 5′-ATGTCCACGTTCAGGCAGGAGG-3′ (3′) and 5′-CTTCAGGTCAAAGTGTGCGATGCG-3′ (5′); primer 5, 5′-ATGTCCACGTTCAGGCAGGAGG-3′ (3′) and 5′-GGATATAGGTGATGACACCGA-3′ (5′); primer 6, 5′-ATGTCCACGTTCAGGCAGGAGG-3′ (3′) and 5′-GCTCGGGCTTGCGGCCGCTG-3′ (5′); primer 7, 5′-AGGAACTGAGAGCCTGCC-3′ (3′) and 5′-CTTCAGGTCAAAGTGTGCGATGCG-3′ (5′); primer 8, 5′-AGGAACTGAGAGCCTGCC-3′ (3′) and 5′-GGATATAGGTGATGATGACACCGA-3′ (5′); primer 9, 5′-AGGAACTGAGAGCCTGCC-3′ (3′) and 5′-CTTCAGGTCAAAGTGTGCGATGCG-3′ (5′); primer 10, 5′-ATGCTGCTGGACAAGAAC-3′ (3′) and 5′-GGATATAGGTGATGACACCGA-3′ (5′); and primer 11, 5′-ATGCTGCTGGACAAGAAC-3′ (3′) and 5′-CTTCAGGTCAAAGTGTGCGATGCG-3′ (5′) (Fig. 3). Exons were predicted using the NCBI LocusLink program. The following primers were used for degenerate PCR: primer IA, 5′-ATGGGNGARGARYTNGG-3′ (5′) and 5′-YTGDATNGGNC-3′ (3′); primer IB, 5′-ATGGGNGARGARYTNGG-3′ (5′) and 5′-RAADATNNNYTTRTC-3′ (3′); primer IIA, 5′-GAYAARNNNATHTT-3′ (5′) and 5′-ARRTTYTGNGCDAT-3′ (3′); primer IIB, 5′-MGNCCNATHCA-3′ (5′) and 5′-ARRTTYTGNGCDAT-3′ (3′); primer III, 5′-ATGGGNGARGARYTNGG-3′ (5′) and 5′-ARRTTYTGNGCDAT-3′ (3′) (Fig. 2). The primers 5′-ATGGGNGARGARYTNGG-3′, 5′-GAYAARNNNATHTT-3′, 5′-MGNCCNATHCA-3′, 5′-YTGDATNGGNC-3′, 5′-RAADATNNNYTTRTC-3′, and 5′-ARRTTYTGNGCDAT-3′ corresponded to amino acid sequences MGEEL, DKXIF, RPIQ, QIPR, FIXKD, and LNQAI, respectively. The human aorta cDNA library was used as the template for PCR with IA, IIA, and III. PCR products from IA and IIA were used as the template for PCR with IB and IIB, respectively. RNA Expression Analysis by Northern Blotting—Total RNA from a series of mouse tissues and poly(A)+ RNA from cultured cells and human bladder was electrophoresed in an agarose gel containing 2% formaldehyde and 20 mm MOPS and blotted onto Hybond N synthetic nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). A multiple tissue Northern blot that has poly(A)+ RNA from a series of human tissues was purchased from Clontech. The membranes were pre-hybridized and hybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) with [32P]dCTP-labeled probe. The cDNA probes used in this study are described as follows. A 0.9-kb EcoRI-NotI fragment encoding the 5′-end of the human ZIPK cDNA and a 1.4-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment encoding full-length human ZIPK were made from pFLAG-CMV4-ZIPK. A 1-kb SalI-NotI fragment encoding the 5′-end of mouse ZIPK and a 1.3-kb SalI-SalI fragment encoding full-length mouse ZIPK were made from pEF-BOS-ZIPK. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins for Binding Studies—BL21 cells were transformed with GST-ZIPK plasmids, described above, and GST-MBS plasmids expressing the C-terminal 183 aa of MBS or the C-terminal 183 aa in which the four leucine residues of the leucine zipper domain have been mutated to alanines (L1007A, L1014A, L1021A, and L1028A) were made as described previously (14Surks H.K. Richards C.T. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51484-51493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were grown in Luria-Bertani media at 30 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6-0.8. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h, and GST fusion proteins were isolated by using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Cell Staining—Cells were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, and 150 mm NaCl), and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of total cell lysate were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated in Figs. 1 and 5, 6, 7. The remaining cell lysate was subjected to either immunoprecipitation using antibodies as indicated in Figs. 6 and 7 and protein A- and G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or GST fusion protein interaction studies by incubation with the indicated GST fusion protein. This treatment was followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blocked membranes were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight and then probed with the secondary antibody linked to peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to densitometric quantitation. For immunofluorescence labeling, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Permeabilized cells were incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody followed by Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR).Fig. 5Interaction of ZIPK with MBS in vitro.A, HEK293 cells were transfected with hZIPK plasmid or control plasmid, and cell lysates were immunoblotted (IB) with either anti-ZIPK (top) or anti-FLAG (bottom) antibodies.

Statistical difference was evaluated by Student's t test. A p value of < 0.01 was regarded as significant. Immunoblotting Studies—A 32-kDa SMPP-1M-associated kinase was detected previously by immunoblotting of rabbit bladder lysates with the anti-hZIPK antibody (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We have used this antibody in immunoblotting studies of proteins expressed by native vascular smooth muscle cells and in studies of HEK293 cells expressing the cDNA for hZIPK (Fig. 1). In both VSMC cells and in heterologous expression studies of HEK293 cells the most prominent protein band detected by the anti-ZIPK antibody was 52 kDa (Fig. 1, upper arrows). A 32-kDa band was also detected in both cell types (arrowhead) but was less prominent, especially in human VSMC lysates. The inclusion of protease inhibitors did not alter the amount of 32-kDa protein detected (+ lanes, Fig. 1). In the HEK293 cells expressing hZIPK, another protein of ∼48 kDa was also prominent. Detection of this 48-kDa protein was also not affected by the inclusion of a mixture of protease inhibitors. cDNA Library Screening for ZIPK and ZIP-like Kinase—A human aorta cDNA library containing 3.5 × 106 independent clones was screened for the presence of ZIPK and ZIP-like kinase by the colony hybridization technique. A 981-bp fragment of the 5′-end of hZIPK was used as the probe. This region of hZIPK cDNA was chosen for the probe design based on a previous report of homology between peptide fragments of ZIP-like kinase and the amino-terminal kinase domain of ZIPK (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The human aorta cDNA library was screened under both high and low stringency conditions. Using high stringency conditions, we obtained 18 positive clones. These positive clones were fully sequenced, and all 18 positive clones were identified as either full-length or fragments of hZIPK. Under low stringency conditions, 41 positive clones were obtained, and 31 were identified as full-length or fragments of hZIPK. We also cloned myosin light chain kinase (eight clones), the kinase domain of which has 48% amino acid sequence identity and 59% nucleotide sequence identity (25Murata-Hori M. Suizu F. Iwasaki T. Kikuchi A. Hosoya H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), as well as part of the ZIPK gene on chromosome 19 (two clones). ZIP-like kinase was not identified by either of the library screens. PCR Studies to Search for ZIP-like Kinase and Detect Potential ZIPK Splice Variants—We designed degenerate PCR primers corresponding to the three peptide sequences derived originally from ZIP-like kinase with minor or uncertain sequence differences from hZIPK (Fig. 2B) (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). All DNA fragments amplified from the human aorta library using these degenerate primers were sequenced (Fig. 2C) but proved to be nonspecific, and no sequences corresponded to those of hZIPK or ZIP-like kinase. To determine whether ZIP-like kinase is a splice variant of hZIPK, we searched for hZIPK splice variants in the human aorta cDNA library. hZIPK mRNA is derived from eight exons on chromosome 19. We designed PCR primers corresponding to each exon and two putative exons designated potential exons A and B, one 5′ to exon1 (potential exon A) and the other between exon 2 and exon 3 (potential exon B) (Fig. 3A) based on predicted potential splice sites and variants (the NCBI LocusLink program). PCR was performed with 11 primer pairs designed to amplify both the known exons and potential exons A and B. Only the hZIPK exons were amplified. A number of DNA fragments were sequenced and proved to be of 100% identity to hZIPK (Fig. 3B). These results make the existence of a potential splice variant in human aorta of hZIPK unlikely. Northern Blotting Studies—We investigated the expression of mRNA encoding ZIP-like kinase in various human tissues and cultured cells by performing Northern blot analyses. In all of these human tissues and cultured cells, a 5′-probe, based on hZIPK, was used at moderate stringency to detect hZIPK and any related transcripts. In all tissues and cells examined, a 2.3-kb band consistent with the predicted size of the hZIPK transcript was present, but no evidence of any other transcripts was noted (Fig. 4, A and B). ZIP-like kinase was co-purified with SMPP-1M originally from bladder smooth muscle (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We therefore obtained human bladder tissue, isolated the mRNA, and performed separate Northern blot experiments (Fig. 4B, right panel). In human bladder, only a 2.3-kb band consistent with the predicted size of the hZIPK transcript was detected, and no evidence of any other transcript was noted. Re-probing of these blots with full-length hZIPK probe led to detection of the same bands and no others, indicating that these 2.3-kb bands are hZIPK mRNA (data not shown). We also investigated hZIPK and ZIP-like kinase expression in various mouse tissues, including brain, aorta, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, uterus, and bladder. Among the mouse tissues, an ∼2.3-kb band was detected. No other smaller mRNA species were detected (data not shown). We therefore could find no evidence that suggested the existence of an mRNA for a ZIP-like kinase in human and mouse tissues or in cultured cells. Interaction of hZIPK with MBS—We investigated whether full-length hZIPK interacts with MBS. FLAG-tagged hZIPK was well expressed in HEK293 cells and distributed uniformly throughout the cytoplasm in these cells (Fig. 5, A and B). FLAG-hZIPK bound the C-terminal half of human MBS (GST-MBS with aa 681-1030). In contrast, neither GST-MBS with aa 847-1030 nor a mutant GST-MBS with aa 847-1030 in which the leucine zipper of MBS is disrupted by alanine substitution (designated GST-MBS 847-1030 LZM in Fig. 5) bound hZIPK. These data confirm an in vitro interaction between full-length hZIPK and the coiled coil-containing domain of MBS (aa 681-847 of human MBS) (Fig. 5C). The binding of native ZIPK from human vascular smooth muscle cells to these GST-MBS fusion proteins was similarly observed (Fig. 5E). In reciprocal studies, full-length ZIPK and N-terminal ZIPK both bound MBS, whereas GST-C-terminal ZIPK did not, supporting the idea that the amino-terminal half of ZIPK binds to MBS (Fig. 5D). Next, MBS and hZIPK were each immunoprecipitated from cells to test for an interaction between the two proteins in vivo. When MBS was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells, FLAG-hZIPK was present in the immunopellet (Fig. 6A), and, reciprocally, the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-hZIPK led to the recovery of MBS in the immunopellet (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that hZIPK and MBS are complexed in the cell. Finally, we studied whether the small GTPase RhoA might regulate the interaction we observed between hZIPK and MBS. In GST pull-down assay studies, no differences were detected in the level of ZIP kinase bound by MBS from native Rho with either RhoN19 (dominant negative) or RhoQL (constitutively active) (data not shown). MLC phosphorylation by ZIP kinase also was assayed by isolating ZIP kinase from cells expressing wild type Rho, RhoN19, or RhoQL, but differences in the level of MLC phosphorylation were not detected in this assay (data not shown). When hZIPK was immunoprecipitated, however, co-immunoprecipitation of MBS was significantly diminished in the presence of a dominant negative mutant of RhoA, RhoN19 (Fig. 7). The constitutively active Rho protein, RhoQL, did not increase the level of ZIPK bound to MBS above the level seen with native (wild type) Rho in these studies (Fig. 7). These immunoprecipitation data support the belief that active Rho promotes the hZIPK-MBS interaction characterized in these studies. Because the regulatory pathways that modulate SMPP-1M activity remain incompletely understood, we undertook this study to identity the endogenous SMPP-1M-associated kinase(s). A 32-kDa ZIP-like kinase had been found previously to co-purify with and inhibit SMPP-1M activity, whereas 52-kDa hZIPK had been shown to phosphorylate MLC and cause cell contraction (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Niiro N. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We set out to clone the SMPP-1M-associated ZIP-like kinase from vascular tissue, employing two methods to screen a highly representative human aorta cDNA library for evidence of ZIP-like kinase. In the first approach, we performed colony hybridization using a probe against the 5′-half of hZIPK, which, because of high homology, would be expected to identify both ZIP-like kinase and hZIPK. We also used a reverse transcription PCR approach with this human aorta library as the template and both degenerate primers and primers designed to identify hZIPK splice variants. In our studies, only hZIPK but not any ZIP-like kinase was present in this library. As alternative approaches, we also used both the 5′-catalytic domain and full-length hZIPK as probes in both vascular and non-vascular cellular RNA Northern hybridization experiments. A variety of human tissues as well as human blood vessel, heart, and VSMCs from a variety of human blood vessel types were studied. Importantly, human bladder tissue was also studied because the ZIP-like kinase was originally purified from bladder smooth muscle tissue (16MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Murani A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In all of these tissues and cells only a single transcript of the expected 2.4 kb for hZIPK was detectable, supporting further the proposal that hZIPK is the sole SMPP-1 M-associated kinase expressed in human tissues. We also tested for the binding of hZIPK to MBS in several ways. Heterologous expression of hZIPK demonstrated that hZIPK binds directly to the coiled coil-containing domain of MBS in GST pull-down protein-protein interaction studies and to complexes with MBS in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, strongly supporting the idea that hZIPK interacts with MBS in the cell. Furthermore, disruption of RhoA activation by overexpression of a dominant negative RhoA mutant inhibited this hZIPK-MBS interaction in cells. We did not detect an effect of RhoN19 on hZIPK-MBS binding using GST fusion proteins or in a MLC phosphorylation assay using immunoprecipitated hZIPK derived from cells expressing wild type or mutant Rho protein. These negative data support either the reduced sensitivity of these assays compared with co-immunoprecipitation or the need for additional cellular proteins for Rho to regulate the hZIPK-MBS interaction. Taken together, the data support the hypothesis that the interaction between hZIPK and MBS may be regulated by RhoA and that hZIPK may play a role in PP1M regulation by RhoA. Studies in both animals and humans have shown that SMPP-1M activity is regulated in health and in disease. Hyperactivity of the RhoA pathway leading to SMPP-1M inhibition and blood vessel contraction has been shown in hypertensive states, and enzyme inhibitors that prevent SMPP-1M inhibition are promising new treatments for cardiovascular disorders (26Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar, 27Kandabashi T.

Our data establish that hZIPK is the SMPP-1M-associated kinase and support the hypothesis that the hZIPK-SMPP-1M interaction is regulated by RhoA. Future studies will be directed at defining the role of hZIPK in the modulation of SMPP-1M activity by vasoconstrictor agonists and other potential mechanisms through which hZIPK regulates vascular smooth muscle cell function."

In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which Hsp105α regulates Hsc70 chaperone activity.

Furthermore, Hsp105α and Hsp105β are phosphorylated at Ser509 by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) 1The abbreviations used are: CK2, protein kinase CK2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; Hip, Hsc70-interacting protein; CHIP, C terminus of Hip.1The abbreviations used are: CK2, protein kinase CK2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; WT, wild type; Hip, Hsc70-interacting protein; CHIP, C terminus of Hip.in vitro and in vivo, and the CK2-mediated phosphorylation modulates the inhibitory effect of Hsp105α on Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone activity (7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recently, Hsp105α and Hsp105β were suggested to function as a substitute for Hsp70 family proteins to suppress the aggregation of denatured proteins in cells under severe stress, in which the cellular ATP level decreases markedly (8Yamagishi N. Ishihara K. Saito Y. Hatayama T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The HSP70 family is a major and well characterized group of heat shock proteins. Several different species of HSP70 family proteins are present in different compartments of eukaryotic cells and play important roles as molecular chaperones that prevent the irreversible aggregation of denatured proteins and assist folding, assembly, and translocation across the membrane of cellular proteins (9Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar, 10Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of Hsp70/Hsc70 relies on its ability to bind to short exposed hydrophobic stretches of polypeptide substrates in an ATP-regulated fashion. The ATP-bound Hsp70/Hsc70 exhibits low affinity and fast exchange rates for substrate, whereas the ADP-bound form has high affinity and slow exchange rates for substrate (11Palleros D.R. Welch W.J.

Conversion of ATP-bound Hsp70/Hsc70 to the ADP-bound form is induced by its intrinsic ATPase activity, which is facilitated by co-chaperones of the HSP40 family (15Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K.

The predicted secondary structure of Hsp105α and Hsp105β is composed of an N-terminal ATP-binding, a β-sheet, a loop, and a C-terminal α-helical domain, similar to those of HSP70 family proteins (2Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Ishihara K. Yasuda K. Hatayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The β-sheet domain of Hsp105α and Hsp105β binds denatured proteins such as Hsp70/Hsc70 (8Yamagishi N. Ishihara K. Saito Y. Hatayama T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, although the ATP-binding domain of Hsp105α and Hsp105β is conserved among HSP70 family proteins, the ATP binding of the domain in HSP105 family proteins has not been elucidated. Furthermore, although Hsp105α suppresses the chaperone activity of Hsp70/Hsc70 (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism of the suppression has not been clarified yet. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms by which Hsp105α regulates Hsc70 chaperone activity and revealed that Hsp105α suppresses the chaperone activity of Hsc70 by inhibiting the ATPase activity of Hsc70 with the concomitant appearance of Hsp105 ATPase activity. Plasmids—Expression plasmids for His-tagged mouse Hsp105α and deletion mutants of Hsp105α in Escherichia coli have been described previously (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To construct an expression plasmid (pTrcHis70) for His-tagged human Hsc70 in E. coli, human Hsc70 cDNA derived from the plasmid pHSC7 (21Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurikara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) was subcloned into XhoI-KpnI sites of the expression vector pTrcHisA (RIKEN Gene Bank, Ibaraki, Japan). For the construction of deletion mutants of Hsc70, a PCR was performed with pTrcHis70 as the template and specific 5′ end-phosphorylated primers (underlining indicates the additional KpnI site): His-Hsc70N2 (1–501 amino acids), 5′-GGGGTACCAGATGTCCAAGGGACCTGCA-3′ and 5′-GGGGTACCTCAAATCTTGTTCTCTTTTCCCGT-3′; His-Hsc-70C1 (509–646 amino acids), 5′-GGGGTACCGTTTGAGCAAGGAAGAC-3′ and 5′-AATCTTCTCTCATCCGCC-3′; His-Hsc70C2 (393–646 amino acids), 5′-GGGGTACCTCTTGGATGTCACTCCT-3′ and 5′-AATCTTCTCTCATCCGCC-3′. PCR products were digested with KpnI and then cloned into the complementary site in pTrcHisA. The expression plasmid for a substitution mutant of His-Hsc70 (pTrcHis70K71A) was made using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis were 5′-CACAGTTTTTGATGCCGGACGTCTGATTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCAATCAGACGTCCGGCATCAAAAACTGTG-3′ (bold letters show the substituted nucleotides). To construct an expression plasmid for GST-tagged mouse Hsp105α (pGEX-105) in E. coli, mouse Hsp105α cDNA derived from the plasmid pTrc105-1 (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was subcloned into EcoRI-BamHI sites of the expression vector pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The expression plasmid for GST-tagged Hsc70K71A (pGEX-70K71A) was constructed by the insertion of human Hsc70 cDNA derived from the plasmid pTrcHis70K71A into BamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX6P-1. All constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21. Protein Purification—His-tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+-chelating agarose column chromatography (Invitrogen) followed by Mono Q anion-exchange column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Among a series of deletion mutants of Hsp105α, only His-Hsp105C3 (see Fig. 1A) was purified by the Ni2+-chelating agarose column chromatography as the protein was tightly bound to and hardly eluted from the Mono Q column. To purify the GST-tagged mouse Hsp105α, the transformant containing pGEX-105 was grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.5. After a 3-h treatment with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d(-)-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C, the cells were ruptured by sonication, and the lysate was loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The column was washed with PBS, and bound protein was eluted with an elution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm glutathione (reduced form). To remove the GST tag from GST-Hsc70K71A, 50 μg of GST-Hsc70K71A was incubated with 10 units of ProScisstion protease (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 μl of cleavage buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) at 5 °C for 24 h. Then, the reaction mixture was incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50% in cleavage buffer) at 4 °C for 1 h, and the unbound fraction that contains Hsc70K71A was collected. Hsc70 was purified from bovine brain by DEAE-CL6B-Sepharose column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and ATP-agarose column chromatography (Sigma), as described previously (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Proteins eluted from the ATP-agarose column were dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT, concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Ultrafree centrifugal filter device (Millipore), and stored at –80 °C. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands were quantified by densitometry. The concentration of proteins was estimated with bovine serum albumin as a standard. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—The interaction between Hsc70 and deletion mutants of Hsp105α was analyzed by pull-down assay. His-tagged Hsp105α or the deletion mutant (20 μm) was incubated with Hsc70 (20 μm) in 50 μl of a binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, the reaction mixtures were incubated with 10 μl of Ni2+-chelating agarose at 4 °C for 1 h, centrifuged, and washed several times with the binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with an elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 500 mm imidazole, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blotting using anti-Hsp70 (Sigma) and anti-PentaHis antibodies (Qiagen). The interaction between Hsp105α and deletion mutants of Hsc70 was determined by GST-pull down assay. His-tagged Hsc70, or the deletion mutant (20 μm) was incubated with GST-Hsp105α (20 μm) in 50 μl of PBS at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the mixtures were incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50% in PBS) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed several times with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm glutathione, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blotting using anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) and anti-PentaHis antibodies. Protein Refolding Assay—The protein refolding assay was conducted as described previously (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase (164 nm) was incubated with Hsc70, Hsp105α, and/or their mutants (2 μm each) in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 2 mm ATP at 42 °C for 30 min. To aliquots (10 μl) of the reaction mixtures was added 20 μl of reactivation buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 3.5 units of creatine kinase, and 60% rabbit reticulocyte lysate. After incubation at 25 °C for a predetermined period, luciferase activity was assayed using a luminometer after mixing an aliquot of the reaction mixture with 50 μl of a luciferase assay solution (Promega). Analysis of ATP Hydrolysis and ATPase Activity—ATP hydrolysis was determined as described previously (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). His-tagged Hsp105α or the deletion mutant (2 μm each) was incubated with Hsc70 and Hsp40 (2 μm each) in 20 μl of a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 500 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol) at 37 °C for 1 h. Aliquots of reaction mixtures were mixed with 500 μl of stop solution containing 4% (v/v) Norit A charcoal, 0.9 m HCl, 90 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mm NaH2PO4 and then centrifuged. The radioactivity in the supernatant was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. For the single turnover ATPase assay, His-tagged Hsp105α or Hsc70 (10 μm) was incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 11 mm Mg(OAc)2, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 3000 Ci/mmol) at 25 °C for 10 min. Then, Hsp105α-[32P]ATP and Hsc70-[32P]ATP were separated from free [32P]ATP by spinning through a Sephadex G-50 column. Hsp105α-[32P]ATP or Hsc70-[32P]ATP (1 μm) was incubated with or without Hsc70, Hsp105α, and/or their mutants in 10 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, and 11 mm Mg(OAc)2 with or without 50 mm KCl at 25 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of reaction mixtures were immediately applied onto Polygram CEL 300 polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Macherey-Nagel) and separated by thin-layer chromatography using a buffer system consisting of 0.5 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. [32P]ATP and [32P]ADP on the plates were detected by autoradiography, and the percentage of ATP hydrolyzed to ADP in each reaction was calculated after densitometry. Domains Necessary for the Interaction between Hsp105α and Hsc70—To elucidate how Hsp105α regulates the Hsc70 chaperone system, we first examined the interaction between Hsc70 and Hsp105α deletion mutants (Fig. 1A). A series of His-tagged Hsp105α deletion mutants was incubated with Hsc70, and pull-down assays were performed using Ni2+-chelating beads. Hsp105ΔL and Hsp105ΔC5 interacted with Hsc70 the same as wild-type Hsp105α, whereas Hsp105Δβ and Hsp105ΔβL lacking the β-sheet domain failed to interact with Hsc70. Furthermore, Hsc70 did not interact with Hsp105N2 or Hsp105C3, which lacked an α-helix and ATP-binding domain, respectively. These results indicated that all domains of Hsp105α except the loop are essential for the interaction between Hsp105α and Hsc70. Next, we examined the interaction between Hsp105α and Hsc70 deletion mutants (Fig. 1B). A series of His-tagged Hsc70 deletion mutants were incubated with Hsp105α, and pull-down assays were performed using Ni2+-chelating beads. Hsc70 deletion mutants lacking the N-terminal ATP-binding, β-sheet, or C-terminal α-helix domain did not interact with Hsp105α, suggesting that all domains of Hsc70 are necessary for the binding to Hsp105α. Interaction of Hsp105α with Hsc70 Is Required for the Suppression of Hsc70 Chaperone Activity—We next examined the suppressive effect of Hsp105α and its mutants on Hsc70 chaperone activity. Luciferase was incubated with Hsc70, Hsp40, and Hsp105α deletion mutants at 42 °C for 30 min, and luciferase activity was assayed after the addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2). Hsp105ΔL and Hsp105ΔC5, which lacked the loop and the C-terminal 5 amino acids, respectively, and were able to interact with Hsc70, suppressed Hsc70 chaperone activity similar to Hsp105α. In contrast, the mutants that were unable to interact with Hsc70 did not suppress the chaperone activity of Hsc70. Thus, the direct interaction of Hsp105α with Hsc70 seemed to be necessary for the suppression of Hsc70 chaperone activity. Hsp105α That Interacts with Hsc70 Enhances ATP Hydrolysis in the Reaction with Hsc70, Hsp40, and Hsp105α—We have shown that hydrolysis of ATP increases when Hsp105α is added to the reaction with Hsc70 and Hsp40 (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Then, we next examined the effect of Hsp105α deletion mutants on ATP hydrolysis in the reaction with Hsc70 and Hsp40 (Fig. 3). Hsc70 displayed a low basal rate of ATP hydrolysis, which was enhanced ∼4-fold by Hsp40 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, Hsp105α and its deletion mutants did not show any intrinsic ATPase activity (Fig. 3A). However, ATP hydrolysis in the reaction with Hsc70, Hsp40, and Hsp105α or the deletion mutant of Hsp105ΔL or Hsp105ΔC5 was enhanced ∼2-fold when compared with that in the reaction with Hsc70 and Hsp40 (Fig. 3B). The Hsp105α mutants that did not interact with Hsc70 and suppress Hsc70 chaperone activity did not affect the hydrolysis of ATP in the reaction with Hsc70 and Hsp40. Thus, Hsp105α that interacted with Hsc70 seemed to enhance ATP hydrolysis in the reaction with Hsc70 and Hsp40. These findings suggest either that Hsp105α enhances the ATPase activity of Hsc70 or that Hsc70 and Hsp40 induce ATPase activity of Hsp105α. Hsp105α Suppresses ATPase Activity of Hsc70—Although Hsp105α contains an ATP-binding consensus sequence similar to that of HSP70 family proteins, no ATPase activity of Hsp105α has been detected yet. Then, we first examined the possibility that Hsp105α enhances the ATPase activity of Hsc70 (Fig. 4). When Hsc70 was incubated with ATP in the absence of K+, Hsc70 existed predominantly in the ATP-bound form, whereas in the presence of K+, Hsc70-ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP due to the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsc70. The hydrolysis of ATP was significantly enhanced by the addition of Hsp40, consistent with the stimulation of Hsc70 ATPase activity by Hsp40 (15Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The addition of Hsp105α, either with or without Hsp40, suppressed the hydrolysis of Hsc70-bound ATP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, when the effect of Hsp105α deletion mutants on the hydrolysis of Hsc70-bound ATP was examined, Hsp105ΔL and Hsp105ΔC5 that interacted with Hsc70 were found to suppress the hydrolysis of Hsc70-bound ATP, similar to Hsp105α. However, the mutants that did not interact with Hsc70 did not suppress the hydrolysis (Fig. 4B). These findings suggested that Hsp105α did not enhance the ATPase activity of Hsc70 but rather suppressed Hsc70 ATPase activity by interacting with Hsc70. ATPase Activity of Hsp105α Is Induced by Hsc70—We examined the second possibility, that Hsc70 and Hsp40 induce ATPase activity of Hsp105α. When Hsp105α was incubated with ATP in the absence of K+, Hsp105α existed predominantly as the ATP-bound form, and Hsp105α-bound ATP was not hydrolyzed to ADP even in the presence of K+ (Fig. 5A). However, Hsp105α-bound ATP was converted to ADP by Hsc70, either with or without Hsp40, in a dose-dependent manner, but not by Hsp40 alone (Fig. 5, A and B). Then, to determine whether the conversion of Hsp105α-bound ATP to ADP by Hsc70 is due to the ATPase activity of Hsc70, we prepared an Hsc70 mutant that was defective in ATP binding. The Lys residue at position 71 of human Hsc70, which is essential for hydrolysis of ATP, was substituted with Ala to yield Hsc70K71A (23Melanie C. O'Brien Flaherty K.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15874-15878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hsc70K71A did not bind ATP (Fig. 6A) but interacted with Hsp105α (Fig. 6B). When ATP-bound Hsp105α was incubated with Hsc70WT or Hsc70K71A, hydrolysis of Hsp105α-bound ATP was observed in the presence or absence of K+, and the hydrolysis was not significantly affected by Hsp40 (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, although Hsc70 did not show any ATPase activity in the absence of K+, Hsc70WT also enhanced the hydrolysis of Hsp105α-bound ATP in the absence of K+. These findings suggest that the ATPase activity of Hsc70 is not necessary for the hydrolysis of ATP bound to Hsp105α, whereas the ATPase activity of Hsp105α is induced by interaction with Hsc70. Hsp105α associates with Hsp70/Hsc70 (5Wakatsuki T. Hatayama T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1998; 21: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Hatayama T. Yasuda K. Yasuda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and suppresses its chaperone activity in mammalian cells (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Hsp105α regulates the chaperone activity of Hsp70/Hsc70, however, had not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that Hsp105α suppresses the ATPase activity of the Hsc70 chaperone, with the concomitant appearance of Hsp105α ATPase activity. Hsp70/Hsc70 exists in either an ATP- or an ADP-bound form, and nucleotides regulate the substrate binding affinity of Hsp70/Hsc70 (Fig. 7). ATP-bound Hsp70/Hsc70 rapidly associates with and dissociates from unfolded polypeptide substrates or folding intermediates. The substrate binding of Hsp70/Hsc70 is stabilized by conversion of bound ATP to ADP, and this conversion is catalyzed by the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70/Hsc70, which is facilitated by co-chaperones of the HSP40 family (15Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Hsp70/Hsc70 substrate complexes dissociate upon the regeneration of Hsp70/Hsc70-ATP. Upon its release from Hsp70/Hsc70, an unfolded polypeptide can fold, aggregate, or be rebound by Hsp40 and Hsp70/Hsc70. Many proteins have been identified as regulators of the Hsp70/Hsc70-mediated refolding of proteins (16Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U.

Hip, initially identified as a protein that interacts with the ATPase domain of Hsp70/Hsc70, stabilizes the ADP-bound form of Hsp70/Hsc70 and prevents the ATP-ADP cycle of Hsp70/Hsc70, resulting in the inhibition of the Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone cycle (16Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic protein BAG-1 inhibits the chaperone activity of Hsp70/Hsc70 through the promotion of the dissociation of ADP from Hsp70/Hsc70 (17Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C.

EMBO J. 1998; 23: 6871-6878Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, CHIP suppresses the reaction cycle of Hsp70/Hsc70 by preventing the binding of ATP or inhibiting the hydrolysis of ATP (19Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 20Meacham G.C. Patterson C. Zhang W. Younger J.M. Cyr D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In addition to these co-chaperones of Hsp70, we showed here that Hsp105α suppresses the substrate binding cycle of Hsc70 by inhibiting the ATPase activity of Hsc70, thereby acting as a negative regulator of the Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone as does CHIP (Fig. 7). Furthermore, it is worth noting that the inhibitory effect of Hsp105α on Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone activity is suppressed by the phosphorylation of Hsp105α by CK2, suggesting a finely and rapidly controlled regulation of the Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone system by the co-chaperone Hsp105α (7Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Hatayama T. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hsp105α is composed of an N-terminal ATP-binding domain, a β-sheet domain in the central region, and a C-terminal α-helical domain similar to HSP70 family proteins (2Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Ishihara K. Yasuda K. Hatayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As all domain structures of Hsp105α except the loop were necessary for the interaction with Hsc70 and all domains of Hsc70 were required for binding to Hsp105α, an almost intact three-dimensional structure of these proteins might be essential for their interaction. Furthermore, although both Hsp105α and Hsc70 bind to non-native proteins via their central β-sheet domain (8Yamagishi N. Ishihara K. Saito Y. Hatayama T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), Hsp105α did not prevent the interaction of Hsc70 with denatured proteins. 2N. Yamagishi, K. Ishihara, and T. Hatayama, unpublished data. Thus, the suppression of Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone activity by Hsp105α seems not to be due to the prevention of substrate binding of Hsc70. Despite the conserved ATP-binding domain of HSP105/110 family proteins, no ATP binding or ATPase activity of these proteins had been observed. In this study, we first demonstrated that Hsp105α binds ATP and hydrolyzes ATP to ADP in the presence of Hsc70 with or without its ATPase activity. When Hsp105α suppressed the chaperone activity of Hsc70 by inhibiting its ATPase activity, the hydrolysis of Hsp105α-bound ATP was concomitantly observed (Fig. 5). Furthermore, an Hsp105α mutant defective in ATP binding (Hsp105K69A) did not suppress either the hydrolysis of Hsc70-bound ATP or the chaperone activity of Hsc70. 2N. Yamagishi, K. Ishihara, and T. Hatayama, unpublished data. However, since Hsp105K69A did not bind to Hsc70, further study is needed to conclude whether ATPase activity of Hsp105α is necessary for suppression of the ATPase and chaperone activity of Hsc70. Hsp105α exists with Hsc70 at a molar ratio of ∼1:10 and associates with Hsp70/Hsc70 in mammalian cells (5Wakatsuki T. Hatayama T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1998; 21: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6Hatayama T. Yasuda K. Yasuda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hsp105α suppresses the aggregation of denatured proteins caused by heat shock in vitro as does Hsp70/Hsc70, but refolding activity of Hsp105α is yet to be revealed (4Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, Hsp70/Hsc70 binds denatured substrates efficiently in the presence of ATP but not ADP, whereas Hsp105α suppresses the aggregation of denatured proteins in the presence of ADP as well as ATP (8Yamagishi N. Ishihara K. Saito Y. Hatayama T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, Hsp105α is suggested to function as a substitute for Hsp70/Hsc70 to suppress the aggregation of denatured proteins in cells under severe stress, in which the cellular ATP level decreases markedly. Since Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperones participate in many important cellular processes, the present finding that Hsp105α suppresses the chaperone activity of Hsp70/Hsc70 by inhibiting their ATPase activity may provide clues as to the role of Hsp105α in chaperone networks in mammalian cells."

An SRP-like protein targeting pathway in chloroplasts mediates the post-translational localization of a family of light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (LHCPs) to the thylakoid membrane.

Following import into the chloroplast stroma, LHCPs bind chloroplast SRP (cpSRP) to form a soluble targeting complex (for review see Refs. 3Keegstra K. Cline K.

Consistent with the GTPase activity of cpFtsY and cpSRP54, GTP is required for LHCP integration (6Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that GTP is not required for transit complex formation (14Yuan J. Kight A. Goforth R.L. Moore M.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Rather, binding of GTP by cpSRP54 and cpFtsY appears to take place upon their interaction at the thylakoid membrane (11Moore M. Goforth R.L. Mori H. Henry R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which closely resembles GTP binding by SRP54 and its receptor in protein targeting to the ER (16Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The unique ability of cpSRP to bind substrates post-translationally is attributed to cpSRP43, which binds both cpSRP54 and a charged 18-amino acid element in LHCPs (L18) to bring about the formation of transit complex (18DeLille J.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the absence of L18 binding, the transit complex fails to form, and LHCPs do not properly integrate into the thylakoid membrane (18DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These adaptor functions associated with cpSRP43 are likely mediated by the putative ankyrin (Ank) domains and chromodomains (chromosome organization modifier) present throughout the protein (see Fig. 1 for domain organization) (9Klimyuk V.I. Persello-Cartieaux F. Havaux M. Contard-David P. Schuenemann D. Meiherhoff K. Gouet P. Jones J.D. Hoffman N.E. Nussaume L. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Ank domains are repetitive ∼33-amino acid motifs that together form a characteristic and stable structure with surfaces that are tailored for many different macromolecular interactions (for review see Ref. 20Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Chromodomains (CDs) are a family of highly conserved ∼44-amino acid motifs first discovered in the Drosophila Polycomb gene silencing protein (21Paro R. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). CD-containing proteins have been found in diverse eukaryotic organisms ranging from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to humans, where CDs mediate protein-protein interactions within the nucleus (for review see Ref. 22Eissenberg J.C. Elgin S.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid studies have been used to examine the protein interaction targets of Ank and CDs in cpSRP43 (23Jonas-Straube E. Hutin C. Hoffman N.E. Schuenemann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24654-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Results from this work suggest that the first domain of a four-Ank domain repeat binds to the L18 motif of LHCPs, whereas the third and fourth Ank domains appear to support homodimerization of cpSRP43. However, the relevance of homodimerization domains is not clear because cpSRP appears to function as a cpSRP43/cpSRP54 heterodimer (7Groves M.R. Mant A. Kuhn A. Koch J. Dubel S. Robinson C. Sinning I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27778-27786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the same two-hybrid study, binding to cpSRP54 was attributed to the combined effects of the two CDs at the C terminus of cpSRP43. Whether CD-mediated binding of cpSRP43 to cpSRP54 is needed for any step of the LHCP localization mechanism is not currently known. Recent progress in the production of functional recombinant cpSRP (7Groves M.R. Mant A. Kuhn A. Koch J. Dubel S. Robinson C. Sinning I. J. Biol.

In this context, we have examined CD-specific mutants of cpSRP43 in assays that reconstitute cpSRP formation, cpSRP·LHCP targeting complex formation, and LHCP integration into isolated thylakoids. Our analyses extend to a previously unexamined third CD near the N terminus identified here by structural modeling. Results of these studies also led us to examine the influence of CD mutants on GTP hydrolysis by cpSRP54 and cpFtsY. Binding of SRP54 to SRα (Ffh and FtsY in bacteria) reciprocally stimulates GTP hydrolysis by each protein in cotranslational SRP targeting (24Powers T. Walter P. Science. 1995; 269: 1422-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), an activity promoted by the 60 S ribosomal subunit in targeting to the ER (17Mandon E.C. Jiang Y. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most importantly, our data suggest that each CD functions at distinct steps in the LHCP targeting/insertion mechanism and that in post-translational targeting, cpSRP43 may functionally replace the ribosome as an activator of the cpSRP54/cpFtsY GTPase cycle. All reagents, enzymes, and standards were purchased commercially. A peptide corresponding to the L18 region of pLHCP (VDPLYPGGSFDPLGLASS) was described previously (18DeLille J. Peterson E.C.

Primers for DNA amplification using PCR were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. PCR amplifications were performed with PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and PCR products were restricted with enzymes purchased from New England Biolabs. All cloned sequences were verified by DNA sequencing (Molecular Resource Laboratory, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins— Recombinant, purified cpSRP54-his and Trx-cpFtsY were produced and isolated as described previously (11Moore M. Goforth R.L. Mori H.

GST-cpSRP43 from the soluble bacterial fraction was initially purified over glutathione-Sepharose™ (Amersham Biosciences) and further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) with bis-Tris, pH 6, and elution with a linear gradient of KCl followed by desalting into 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 (HKM) prior to use. For the production of cpSRP43, purified GST-cpSRP43 was desalted into 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, and incubated overnight with PreScission Protease™ (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C to cleave the GST tag. Cleaved cpSRP43 was then desalted into phosphate-buffered saline and passed over glutathione-Sepharose™ to remove the cleaved GST tag and PreScission Protease™. cpSRP43 was further purified by anion exchange by using a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by desalting into HKM buffer before use. All cpSRP43 deletion clones were constructed by PCR (see below) and cloned into BamHI- and EcoRI-restricted pGEX-6P-2 by using the same restriction sites introduced into the forward and reverse primers, respectively. Coding sequences for the construction of cpSRP43 deletion constructs were based on the alignment of the CDs of cpSRP43 and mouse modifier protein 1 (mM-HP1b) (Fig. 2A). The forward primer used to construct mcpSRP43 lacking the N-terminal CD (CD1) contained the coding sequence for the N-terminal 24 amino acids of mcpSRP43 followed by the coding sequence of the Ank1 region. The reverse primer corresponded to the 3′ end of cpSRP43 and the neighboring stop codon. Hence, the resulting plasmid (p-cpSRPΔCD1) codes for mature cpSRP43 lacking CD1 amino acids SSYG... EYET. Plasmid coding for cpSRP43 that lacks the second chromodomain (CD2) of cpSRP43 (p-cpSRPΔCD2) was produced by overlap extension (26Horton R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar) by using internal primers that overlap at the 5′ ends and bind immediately outside of CD2. The same exact outside primers used to construct mcpSRP43-6P-2 (14Yuan J. Kight A. Goforth R.L. Moore M. Peterson E.C. Sakon J. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32400-32404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), when paired with each appropriate internal primer, resulted in two separate overlapping PCR products that were subsequently spliced by extension of the overlapping ends to produce the coding sequence for mcpSRP43 that begins AAVQRN and lacks the CD2 amino acids FEYA... EDGL. Plasmid coding for cpSRP43 that lacks the C-terminal (CD3) chromodomain (p-cpSRPΔCD3) was produced by using an exact forward primer and a reverse primer that binds immediately upstream of the CD3 coding region and introduces a stop codon immediately following CD2 such that the protein begins AAVQRN and ends GLEYE. Plasmid coding for cpSRP-A1-CD2 utilized the same reverse primer as was used to generate cpSRPΔCD3 along with an exact forward primer that binds at the beginning of the Ank region such that the protein begins YETP and ends GLEY. All deletion and domain expression constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 Star (Invitrogen) for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyrano-side-induced protein expression. GST-cpSRPΔCD1, GST-cpSRPΔCD2, GST-cpSRPΔCD3, and GST-cpSRP-A1-CD2 were produced and purified as described above for GST-cpSRP43. Cleaved constructs were produced and purified as described for cpSRP43. Coding sequences for cpSRP43 domains CD1, CD2, and CD3 were amplified by PCR using forward primers corresponding to the coding sequences of the desired amino acids indicated in Fig. 1. A BamHI restriction site was incorporated at the 5′ end of the forward primer to allow ligation of the restricted PCR products into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) restricted with BamHI and SmaI. CD1, CD2, and CD3 expression constructs were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 Star for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced protein expression. Following bacterial lysis, expressed proteins were affinity-purified by using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography followed by purification by anion exchange chromatography before being desalted into HKM buffer. The nucleotide sequence coding for cpSRP54 lacking the C-terminal 26 amino acids was amplified by using an exact forward primer that introduced a KpnI site and a reverse primer that bound immediately upstream of the 26 amino acids to be deleted. The reverse primer also incorporated an in-frame 6-histidine tag plus a HindIII site such that the protein ends ARRKHHHHHH. The purified PCR product was restricted and ligated into KpnI/HindIII-restricted pGEM-4Z prior to subcloning into pPROLar.A122 by using the same restriction sites. Expression and purification of cpSRPΔC26–54-his were performed as described for cpSRP54-his. The nucleotide sequence coding for the M domain of cpSRP54, beginning MGDVLS and ending GSGN, was amplified from pNH2 (5Franklin A.E. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22175-22180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by using XbaI and SmaI sites to create pGEM-3Z-M domain-cpSRP54 for in vitro transcription/translation. The nucleotide sequence coding for the NG domain of cpSRP54, beginning MFGQLTG and ending GRIL, was similarly amplified by using a forward primer that incorporated an XbaI site and added the additional amino acids MG immediately preceding the NG domain. The reverse primer incorporated a stop immediately following the coding sequence for the NG domain and provided a blunt end for subsequent ligation into SmaI- and XbaI-restricted pGEM 3Z to create the in vitro transcription/translation clone pGEM-3Z-NG domain-cpSRP54. Transit Complex and pLHCP Transport Assays—Transit complex was formed in 30-μl assays essentially as described (18DeLille J. Peterson E.C. Johnson T. Moore M. Kight A. Henry R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1926-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Thirty picomoles of recombinant cpSRP43 or appropriate deletion construct and an equimolar amount of recombinant cpSRP54-his or cpSRPΔC26–54-his were substituted for stromal extract (SE) and added to 5 μl of 35S-labeled pLHCP translation product (15Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) containing 1.7 fmol of LHCP diluted 1:3 in HK buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0). Each assay was brought to 30 μl final volume with HK buffer and final concentrations of 0.2 mm GTP and 5 mm ATP and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C before the addition of 5 μl of cold 50% glycerol. Control assays were conducted as above but included either no protein components or 20 μl of SE. For each assay, 10 μl of sample was analyzed by 6% nondenaturing PAGE and imaged on a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) to distinguish cpSRP·LHCP transit complex from aggregated LHCP. For assays in which L18 synthetic peptide was used to compete with LHCP for binding to cpSRP, transit complex was formed by adding 40 pmol each of cpSRP54-his and either cpSRP43 or cpSRP-A1-CD2 that had been preincubated for 10 min with varying (from 0 to 500 μm) amounts of synthetic L18 peptide in HKM buffer. Protein mixtures were allowed to incubate for 10 min at 25 °C, and from this point the assay was performed as described above in the absence of additional GTP and ATP. Transport of pLHCP into thylakoid membranes was essentially performed as described previously (27Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Thylakoid membranes were isolated and washed in buffer containing 1 m potassium acetate and 1 mm dithiothreitol in Import Buffer (IB: 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8, 330 mm sorbitol). Each 75-μl reaction containing 100 pmol of cpSRP54-his (or cpSRPΔC26–54-his), Trx-cpFtsY, and cpSRP43 construct; 1 mm GTP; and 1 mm ATP was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and then added to 25 μl of 2× salt-washed thylakoids (1× thylakoids = 0.5 mg/ml chlorophyll) in IBM (IB + 10 mm MgCl2). After a 5-min incubation, 5 μl of 35S-labeled pLHCP translation product diluted 1:3 in HK buffer was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 25 °C in light. Following collection of thylakoids by centrifugation and protease treatment with thermolysin (28Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the thylakoids were solubilized with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE solubilization buffer and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE by loading 10 μl of each assay per lane. Integrated LHCP, as noted by the formation of a correctly sized degradation product, was visualized by PhosphorImaging. Protein Binding Assays—cpSRP54-his and cpSRPΔC26–54-his binding assays were performed by combining 100 pmol of each GST-fused cpSRP43 deletion or domain expression construct with 100 pmol of cpSRP54-his or cpSRPΔC26–54-his and 70 μl of a 50% glutathione-Sepharose slurry in 10 mm HK, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0, in a final volume of 270 μl. Samples were allowed to mix end-over-end for 1 h at 4 °C and then were washed as described (19Tu C.J. Peterson E.C. Henry R. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13187-13190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) by utilizing PSU 6.5-mm centrifuge filters (Whatman). Proteins were eluted in 50 μl of 40 mm glutathione in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. Eluted proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized directly by staining with Coomassie Blue. Interactions with pLHCP, L18-PPL, cpSRP54-M domain, and cpSRP54-NG domain were performed by incubation of 100 pmol of each GST fusion protein with 20 μl of 35S-labeled, in vitro translated product produced as for pLHCP (15Payan L.A. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 603-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Incubation, washing, and elution were performed as above, and eluates were visualized by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImaging. Assay of GTPase Activity—Recombinant cpSRP43 and deletion constructs were assayed for GTPase activity in the presence and absence of cpSRP54-his and cpFtsY as described (29Gonzalez-Romo P. Sanchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). GTPase activity was measured in solution by determining the amount of inorganic phosphate released by GTP hydrolysis. Assays containing 150 pmol of each indicated protein component and 2 mm GTP in 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2 were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. After incubation SDS was added to a final concentration of 6% to denature protein components and prevent subsequent GTPase activity. The addition of ascorbic acid and ammonium molybdate (to 6 and 1%, respectively) was followed by a 5-min incubation, and subsequently each assay was brought to 1% sodium citrate, sodium (meta)arsenite, and acetic acid for a final volume of 1.05 ml. The absorbance of each sample was then measured at 850 nm. Throughout the duration of the assay, the amount of GTP hydrolyzed increased linearly. Furthermore, a standard curve of inorganic phosphate was linear between 2 and 75 nmol of Pi and was used to determine the amount of Pi released in each assay. A substrate control that lacked protein components and a zero time control with the protein denatured by the addition of 6% SDS prior to the addition of GTP varied from 0.42 to –0.21 nmol of Pi between experiments and were included to correct for nonspecific hydrolysis and background in each experiment. Domain Analysis Indicates the Presence of Three Chromodomains in cpSRP43—The unusual function of a chromodomain protein (see Fig. 1 for domain organization) in protein targeting led us to investigate the role of individual CDs at distinct steps of the LHCP localization pathway. We first subjected the cpSRP43 sequence to SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) analysis (30Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), which indicated the presence of a repeating ankyrin domain region and two CDs at the C-terminal region of cpSRP43 as reported previously (23Jonas-Straube E. Hutin C. Hoffman N.E. Schuenemann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24654-24660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, an uncharacterized third CD was predicted at the N terminus of cpSRP43. An alignment of the CDs (termed CD1, CD2, and CD3) of cpSRP43 revealed a high level of similarity between all three domains and a CD from a well characterized mouse heterochromatin-associating protein, mouse modifier protein 1 (mM-HP1b) (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2 shows the core structure of each CD present in cpSRP43, each derived using the homology building program Swiss model (31Schwede T. Diemand A. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Res. Microbiol. 2000; 151: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the coordinates from a determined three-dimensional structure of a known chromatin binding domain from mouse modifier protein 1 (1AP0) (32Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Broadhurst R.W. Raine A.R. Archer S.J. Stott F.J. Murzin A.G. Singh P.B. Domaille P.J. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2473-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The models suggest that the most highly conserved residues found among the three predicted chromodomains likely stabilize the β-sheet structure. The amino acids of the β-sheet core exhibit a strikingly invariant conformation, reflecting the canonical CD conformation that has been observed in other systems. For example, the positions of the Tyr and Trp residues indicated by asterisks are identical to those important for function in HP1 of Drosophila and mouse (33Nielsen P.R. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Callaghan J. Bannister A. Kouzarides T. Murzin A.G. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). However, the third conserved residue necessary for histone binding in HP1 domains, Phe, is changed to a Gly or Met in the CDs of cpSRP43 which may influence target specificity. The most variable region among the CDs is the C-terminal α-helix, the function of which is not well characterized in other CD-containing proteins. The structural features of the models are reasonable in terms of what is known about protein structure in general, i.e. a well packed core is formed by hydrophobic residues and surface residues are primarily hydrophilic. Furthermore, main chain conformations are in acceptable regions where bond angles and lengths as well as planarity are all acceptable using PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4363) Google Scholar). Overall, the models indicate reasonable conformations that adhere to known chromodomain structures. As such, these models argue strongly for the presence of a previously unidentified CD, CD1, near the N terminus of cpSRP43. We have used these models to construct plasmids that either express cpSRP43 deletions lacking individual CDs or express only the individual CDs (refer to Fig. 1). The proteins were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins, purified to at least 85% homogeneity (Fig. 3), and were used in assays that reconstitute distinct steps of the LHCP localization process. Chromodomains Exhibit Distinct Functions in Two Stages of LHCP Localization—In order to examine the functional role of CDs in post-translational cpSRP-based protein targeting, purified CD deletion constructs of cpSRP43 were mixed with recombinant cpSRP54-his,"

In the normal SCA1 alleles usually 1–3 CAT triplets break the continuity of the CAG repeat tracts. Here we show what is the structural role of the CAU interruptions in the SCA1 transcripts. Depending on their number and localization within the repeat tract the interruptions either enlarge the terminal loop of the hairpin formed by the repeats, nucleate the internal loops in its stem structure, or force the repeats to fold into two smaller hairpins. Thus, the interruptions destabilize the CAG repeat hairpin, which is likely to decrease its ability to participate in the putative RNA pathogenesis mechanism driven by the long CAG repeat hairpins.

Wells R.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 159-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Cummings C.J. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol.

The best known examples of these diseases are: myotonic dystrophy (DM) caused by the expansion of CTG repeat in 3′-UTR of the DMPK gene; fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and mental retardation syndrome (FXS) resulting from, respectively, smaller or larger expansions of the CGG repeat in 5′-UTR of the FMR1 gene; as well as Huntington disease (HD) in which the CAG repeat expansion in the protein coding region of the IT-15 gene is implicated. One of the hallmarks of these diseases is genetic anticipation i.e. an earlier age of the onset and increased severity of clinical symptoms in subsequent generations, correlated with the increasing length of expanded alleles. The SCA1 usually appears in the fourth decade of life and death occurs between 10 and 15 years after the onset of symptoms. Typical clinical features of the SCA1 include ataxia, dysarthria and bulbar dysfunction. The neuropathology of the SCA1 is characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinocerebellar tract. The SCA1 gene that encodes nuclear protein ataxin-1 of a yet unknown function, harbors the expandable CAG repeat in its coding region (4Chung M.Y. Ranum L.P. Duvick L.A. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y.

On the other hand, recent studies revealed the importance of the ataxin-1-specific sequence context for the protein function and showed that even the high level expression of an expanded poly-Q tract protein in the nucleus may be insufficient to cause disease (14Emamian E.S.

According to this mechanism the expanded repeats in transcripts form long stable hairpins, which recruit double-stranded RNA-binding proteins in a repeat length-dependent manner, sequestering them from other transcripts and interfering with their normal functions (22Miller J.W.

The length of CAG repeat in the SCA1 gene ranges from 6 to 43 repeats and the number of CAT interruptions varies from 0 to 3 in a normal population (1Bowater R.P. Wells R.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res.

Considering both repeat length and its interruption status about 40 different SCA1 alleles are known. The alleles containing two CAT interruptions strongly predominate in all analyzed populations (78–95%). They range in length from 23 to 43 repeats and a single CAG triplet always separates CAT interruptions. The alleles harboring one or three interruptions contribute to 0–11% and 0–4% of all alleles, and normal SCA1 variants containing uninterrupted repeat tracts of a maximum length of 21 repeats are also rare and contribute to 0–7% in different populations (23Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal alleles, the great majority of pathologically expanded SCA1 variants do not contain repeat interruptions. The postulated role of interruptions occurring within tandem repeats in genes is to prevent repeat expansion or contraction during DNA replication and repair. Their loss in the CAG repeat of the SCA1 gene generates much longer pure repeat tracts that are genetically less stable and more prone to expansion (23Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J.

They may inhibit slippage between nascent and template strands by keeping them in register, or destabilize the hairpin structures aberrantly formed by slipped DNA strands. The SCA1 alleles containing either the interrupted normal repeats or the expanded mutant repeats are transcribed, processed, transported to cytoplasm, and translated. The question of the possible differences in the efficiency of these processes between various normal and between the normal and mutant SCA1 transcripts has not been addressed so far. The physiological cellular function of the CAG repeats in transcripts, and the role of repeat interruptions is also completely unknown. To make the first step toward finding answers to these questions we describe here structures formed by the repeat regions in SCA1 transcripts representing different types of naturally occurring SCA1 alleles. Preparation of DNA Templates and in Vitro Transcription—DNA templates for in vitro transcription were synthesized by PCR from gel-purified SCA1 amplification products containing different variants of the CAG repeat tracts as described earlier (23Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), using the forward primer (SCA1-FT7) containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAGTCTGAGCCA and reverse primer (SCA1-RT7) 5′-TCTGCTGGGCTGGTGG. The PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction containing: a DNA template, 1 μm each primer SCA1-FT7 and SCA1-RT7, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 m m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 μm of each of the dNTPs, and 1.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) in the following conditions: 94 °C, 1 min; 35 cycles: 94 °C, 1 s, 62 °C, 1 s, 72 °C, 20 s. A transcription reaction carried out in a 50-μl volume contained about 10 pmol of DNA template (10–20 μl of the PCR product described above), 400 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter), 3 mm guanosine, 0.5 mm each of ribo-NTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm NaCl, and 50 units of RNazin. Incubation was at 37 °C for 1 h. The RNA products were purified in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels, and 5′-end-labeled with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Epicenter) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol; ICN) at 37 °C for 5 min. Preparation of Human Fibroblast Whole Cell Extract—The whole cell extract was prepared from 6 × 107 human fibroblast cells growing in log phase according to modified standard procedure (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001: 17.4-17.12Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were pelleted and washed twice in phosphate-buffer saline and resuspended in a double volume of hypotonic swelling buffer (7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and after 10 min incubation on ice, they were homogenized 30× in Dounce homogenizer followed by the addition of one-tenth of the final volume of the neutralizing buffer (21 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 116 mm KCl, 3.6 mm MgCl2, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Finally homogenate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was stored at –70 °C with 40% glycerol. Nuclease Digestions and Lead Cleavages in Water Solution and in Cellular Extract—Prior to structure probing reactions, the 32P-labeled RNAs were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedure in a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 80 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, by heating the sample at 80 °C for 1 min and then slowly cooling to 37 °C. Limited RNA digestion was initiated by mixing 5 μl of the RNA sample (50,000 cpm) with 5 μl of a probe solution containing either lead ions or nucleases S1, Mung Bean or ribonucleases T1, T2 (final probe concentrations are specified in the figure legends). The structure probing experiments were performed either in 1 or 10 mm final concentration of MgCl2 (other reaction conditions were the same) and no significant differences in cleavage patterns were observed. RNase H digestion was performed by adding to the transcript solution, after denaturation and renaturation procedure (as above), one of the following three types of oligodeoxynucleotides: libraries of random 6-mers (100 pmol) or random 7-mers (100 pmol) or complementary to CAG repeats oligonucleotide with sequence 5′-TGCTGCT (5 pmol), and RNase H to the final concentration of 0.10 or 0.25 units/μl. All reactions were performed at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (7.5 m urea and 20 mm EDTA with dyes) and sample freezing. The reactions in cell extracts were performed as follows. Before the nuclease treatment 1 μl of RNA sample in water solution (100,000 cpm) was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with 3 μl of cellular extract (protein concentration 2 mg/ml and the exogenously added Mg2+ and K+ ions were at about 0.6 mm and 15 mm concentration, respectively). Limited enzymatic digestion was initiated by adding to the RNA sample 2 μl of probe solution with different enzyme concentration: RNase T1 (0.05 and 0.1 units/μl), RNase T2 (0.02 and 0.05 units/μl), nuclease S1 (2.5 and 5.0 units/μl). All reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 5 min and stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction. After precipitation the RNA samples were diluted with the stop solution described above and loaded on the gel. Analysis of the Reaction Products—To determine the cleavage sites, the products of lead-induced hydrolysis and nuclease digestion were separated in 8–15% polyacrylamide gels containing 7.5 m urea, 90 mm Tris borate buffer, and 2 mm EDTA, along with the products of alkaline hydrolysis and limited T1 ribonuclease digestion of the same RNA molecule. The alkaline hydrolysis ladder was generated by the incubation of the labeled RNA in formamide containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 100 °C for 10 min. The partial T1 ribonuclease digestion of the RNAs was performed under semi-denaturing conditions (10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0; 3.5 m urea) with 0.2 units/μl of the enzyme during incubation at 55 °C for 10 min. The cleavage sites characteristic for nucleases S1 and H were determined by comparison with the homologous S1 ladder (not shown). The RNA fragments generated by nucleases S1 and H terminate with 3′-hydroxyls and migrate slower than the corresponding formamide and T1 fragments. Electrophoresis was performed at 1500 V and was followed by autoradiography at –80 °C. Electrophoresis in Nondenaturing Conditions—The RNA structure homogeneity was analyzed for each transcript by the electrophoresis of radiolabeled samples in 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel 400/300/0.4 mm (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29/1) buffered with 45 mm Tris borate, at a fixed temperature of 37 °C. Prior to gel electrophoresis, the 32P-labeled transcripts were subjected to a denaturation and renaturation procedure in a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 40 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, by heating the sample at 80 °C for 1 min. and slowly cooling it to 37 °C, and mixed with an equal volume of 7% sucrose with dyes. Electrophoresis was conducted at a constant power of 15 watts and was followed by phosphorimager analysis. RNA Secondary Structure Modeling—RNA secondary structure prediction was performed using the mfold program version 3.1 (29Mathews D.H. Sabina J. Zuker M. Turner D.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 911-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (3204) Google Scholar). This program is designed to determine the optimal and suboptimal secondary structures of RNA calculated for 1 m NaCl solution at 37 °C, and to count free energy contributions for various secondary structure motifs. Fifteen distinct SCA1 transcripts analyzed in this study differed in the number of CAG repeats from 27 to 54, while having the same specific flanking sequences 37 nt at the 5′-side and 59 nt at 3′-side of the repeat. Besides their length, the repeat regions varied also in the number and locations of the repeat interruptions (Table I). Accordingly, the transcripts could be divided into four groups. The first and the largest group (10 transcripts) included all those containing two CAU interruptions described by the formula (CAG)nCAUCAGCAU(CAG)m, in short n-1-1-1-m (interruptions are underlined). Within this group there were transcripts containing 27–36 repeats and either symmetrical or asymmetrical distribution of the interruptions. In the first subgroup (2 transcripts), the interruption region was flanked by 12 or 15 pure CAG repeats. In the larger second subgroup with the asymmetrical CAU distribution the longer tract of pure repeats was located either at the 5′-side n>m, or at 3′-side m>n of the interruption region. It is noteworthy, that within this group is a transcript from SCA1 allele from healthy individual, which contains as many as 43 repeats in the configuration 23-1-1-1-17. The genetic stability of such long alleles is secured by the presence of repeat interruptions (23Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Matsuyama Z. Izumi Y. Kameyama M. Kawakami H. Nakamura S. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 546-548PubMed Google Scholar). In the second group there are two transcripts containing a single asymmetrically located CAU interruption in the tract of either 28 or 29 CAG repeats, and a transcript containing three interruptions in the 11-1-1-1-1-1-15 configuration is the only representative of the third group. Finally, the last group contains two transcripts harboring pure pathologically expanded repeat tracts of the 53 and 54 CAG repeats derived from SCA1 patients. Analyzed transcripts (Table I) represented all possible types of the interruption patterns described so far in world populations (23Sobczak K. Krzyzosiak W.J. Human Mutat. 2004; 24: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In their selection the number and localization of CAU triplets as well as the total length of a triplet repeat region were taken into account.Table ICharacteristics of repeat interruption patterns in the analyzed SCA1 RNA fragments and the names of in vitro transcriptsNumber of repeatsSequence configurationTranscript nameaCAU interruptions are underlined.Difference in length of pure repeat tracts27(CAG)12CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1212-1-1-1-12Δ = 028(CAG)11CAU (CAG)1611-1-16Δ = -5(CAG)12CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1412-1-1-1-14Δ = -229(CAG)16CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1016-1-1-1-10Δ = +6(CAG)12CAU (CAG)1612-1-16Δ = -430(CAG)12CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1512-1-1-1-15Δ = -3(CAG)13CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1413-1-1-1-14Δ = -131(CAG)11CAUCAGCAUCAGCAU (CAG)1511-1-1-1-1-1-15Δ = -432(CAG)14CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1514-1-1-1-15Δ = -1(CAG)12CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1712-1-1-1-17Δ = -533(CAG)15CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1515-1-1-1-15Δ = 036(CAG)17CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1617-1-1-1-16Δ = +143bThis variant is derived from healthy individual; pure repeats of this length are pathogenic.(CAG)23CAUCAGCAU (CAG)1723-1-1-1-17Δ = +653cMutant variants derived from SCA1 patients.(CAG)53pure(CAG)53-54cMutant variants derived from SCA1 patients.(CAG)54pure(CAG)54-a CAU interruptions are underlined.b This variant is derived from healthy individual; pure repeats of this length are pathogenic.c Mutant variants derived from SCA1 patients. Open table in a new tab All investigated transcripts were end-labeled and their solution structure was analyzed with a set of well-characterized chemical and enzymatic probes. Among the single-strand specific nucleases used were the nucleases S1 and Mung Bean showing little sequence specificity, RNase T2 cutting all internucleotide bonds but showing some preference for those after A-residues and G-specific RNase T1 (31Ehresmann C.

Also, the short oligodeoxynucleotide 5′-TGCTGCT (ctg-ODN), as well as the ODN libraries (6-mer and 7-mer) with a randomized sequence were used together with Escherichia coli RNase H, which executed RNA cleavages at the sites of RNA/DNA hybrids. Earlier studies have shown that RNA is cut at the 3′-side of the RNA/DNA hybrid and 5′-phosphate and 3′-OH groups are left at the cleavage site (36Lima W.F. Mohan V. Crooke S.T. J. Biol.

Pure Expanded CAG Repeats Form a Stable Hairpin Structure, Which Is Further Stabilized by Specific Flanking Sequences in the SCA1 Transcript—The normal SCA1 alleles containing pure uninterrupted CAG repeats are very rare and they were found in a few populations only. On the other hand, all mutant alleles contain pure repeat tracts. The structure probing results obtained for transcripts from two expanded SCA1 alleles are shown in Fig. 1. The most intense cuts generated by nucleases occur between the nucleotides A26 and A28 (i.e. between the adenyl residues of the CAG repeats 26 and 28) in the pure(CAG)53, and between A26 and A29 in pure(CAG)54. The rest of the repeat region is mildly cleaved by lead ions, which show some preference for cuts at the CpA bonds over the ApG, and cleavages at the internucleotide bonds C1pA1 and A1pG1 within the first CAG repeat are enhanced. Also, the enhanced RNase T2 and RNase H cuts can be detected in that region. What is noteworthy, is that none of the probes used cleaved short 6–7-nt sequences directly flanking the repeat region at both its sides. These results imply that the entire repeat region forms an autonomous structure, which includes the repeats themselves (hairpin H4) and the cleavage-resistant duplex formed by the six base pairs of its flanking sequences (H3) (Fig. 1B). This kind of structure explains why the different number of the reactive internucleotide bonds is observed in the terminal loop of the pure(CAG)53 and pure(CAG)54. In the former, the 4-nucleotide terminal loop occurs, whereas the 7-nucleotide loop region is present in the latter (Fig. 1B). These results are in accord with the observations made for shorter model transcripts (CNG)16 and (CNG)17 containing the artificial G-C clamp at the base of their hairpin stem (20Sobczak K. de Mezer M. Michlewski G. Krol J. Krzyzosiak W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5469-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For comparison the model transcripts having not-clamped repeats were shown to have freedom of alignment and formed several alternative “slipped” structures each containing 4-nucleotide terminal loop (20Sobczak K. de Mezer M. Michlewski G. Krol J. Krzyzosiak W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5469-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The lack of enhanced cuts at the 3′-terminal CAG repeats in pure(CAG)53 and pure(CAG)54 may serve as further argument for the existence of a natural clamp formed by a repeat flanking sequence in the SCA1 transcripts. This H3 duplex adds extra stability to the CAG repeat hairpin. Importantly, the same cleavage resistance of flanking sequences, which is shown for the two mutant transcripts is also observed in all other transcripts analyzed in this study. This means that the same type of structure (H3) is formed by flanking sequences in all these transcripts (Fig. 2). At the 3′-side of the repeat clamp another stable hairpin structure occurs (H5). It is composed of 11 uninterrupted base pairs and 7-nucleotide terminal loop, which is well mapped by the nucleases but not cleaved by RNase H in the presence of the 6-mer and 7-mer ODN libraries. The close proximity of the H3 and H5 helices, together with cleavage resistance of the region, which separates them, may suggest their involvemen"

A green fluorescent protein-RhoGDI fusion protein was engineered and found to elicit actin reorganization through the inactivation of Rho GTPases. Green fluorescent protein-RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP cooperatively stimulated actin reorganization and translocation of Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol, and a RhoGDI mutant, RhoGDI(I177D), that is defective in extracting Rho GTPases off the membrane inhibited the actions of RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP on the translocation of Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol. A human RhoGDI small interfering RNA was transfected into HeLa cells to knock down 90% of the endogenous RhoGDI expression. HeLa cells with knockdown RhoGDI were resistant to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton elicited by type III-delivered ExoS RhoGAP. This indicates that ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI function in series to inactivate Rho GTPases, in which RhoGDI extracting GDP-bound Rho GTPases off the membrane and sequestering them in cytosol is the rate-limiting step in Rho GTPase inactivation. A eukaryotic GTPase-activating protein, p50RhoGAP, showed a similar cooperativity with RhoGDI on actin reorganization, suggesting that ExoS RhoGAP functions as a molecular mimic of eukaryotic RhoGAPs to inactivate Rho GTPases through RhoGDI.

On the cell membrane Rho GTPases function as molecular switches that are tightly regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which activate Rho GTPases by stimulating the exchange of GDP for GTP, and by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which inactivate Rho GT-Pases by catalyzing the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide disassociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) is a multifunctional regulator of Rho GTPases. RhoGDI inhibits GEF-stimulated GDP disassociation from Rho GTPases (14Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits both intrinsic and RhoGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis in vitro (15Hart M.J. Maru Y. Leonard D. Witte O.N. Evans T. Cerione R.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10004-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). RhoGDI has two distinct domains, an N-terminal flexible regulatory domain, and a C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain (18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regulatory domain binds to the switch I and switch II regions of Cdc42, which presumably inhibits both GDP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis through interfering with the interaction between Rho GTPases and GAPs and GEFs. The hydrophobic binding pocket within the C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of RhoGDI binds to the isoprenyl moiety of Rho GTPases and extracts Rho GTPases from membrane and forms a tight GDI-Rho complex in the cytosol. The mechanism that stimulates release of the Rho GTPases from RhoGDI is unclear but may involve conformational changes upon the binding of phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-bisphosphate and Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin to the Rho GTPase-RhoGDI complex (19Chuang T.H.

Although GEFs appear to initiate Rho GTPase activation, current studies showed that Rho GTPases complexed with RhoGDI were resistant to activation by GEFs (14Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar, 24Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that release of Rho GTPases from RhoGDI was required for Rho GTPase membrane translocation and activation by GEFs (25Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that RhoGDI plays an important role in Rho GTPase regulation. Rho GTPases are preferred targets for bacterial toxins (26Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Through modulation of Rho GTPases activity, bacterial pathogens may either facilitate invasion into nonprofessional cells or prevent phagocytosis by professional phagocytes. Toxins modulate Rho GTPase activity through covalent modification or noncovalent mechanisms that regulate the nucleotide binding state (reviewed in Ref. 27Barbieri J.T. Riese M.J. Aktories K. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 315-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Toxins that covalently modify Rho GTPases include: C3 exoenzyme, which inactivates RhoA signaling through ADP-ribosylation of RhoA-C at Arg41; Clostridium difficile toxins A and B, which inactivate RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 through glucosylation of Thr37/35; cytotoxic necrotizing factor, which activates RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 through deamidation of Rho GTPases at Gln61/63; and YopT, which inactivates RhoA as a cysteine protease that cleaves the isoprenyl moiety of RhoA. Toxins that regulate the nucleotide binding states of Rho GTPases include ExoS, ExoT, SptP, and YopE, which are GAPs for various Rho GTPases, and SopE, which is a GEF for Rac and Cdc42. Although the enzymatic actions of the bacterial GAPs or GEFs toward their specific Rho GTPases are well characterized, little is known about how these bacterial GAPs and GEFs interact with the host regulators of Rho GTPases. Therefore, the present study investigated the roles of RhoGDI (RhoGDI-1) in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton stimulated by ExoS RhoGAP. Plasmid Construction—Glutathione S-transferase-RhoGDI expressing vector, pGEX-RhoGDI, was a gift from Dr. Klaus Aktories. The cDNA encoding RhoGDI-1 in pGEX-RhoGDI was subcloned into the BamHI sites of pEGFPC1 to produce a GFP-RhoGDI-1 fusion protein. The mutations I177D and L55S,L56S on pGFP-RhoGDI were obtained through standard site-directed mutagenesis procedures using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pEXV-p50RhoGAP was a gift from Dr. Alan Hall. The DNA encoding p50RhoGAP was amplified by PCR using primers containing HindIII/EcoRI sites and C-terminal HA tag (positive primer: 5′-gat ctc gag aag ctt gcc atg gat ccg ctc tca-3′; negative primer: 5′-gtc gac gaa ttc tca caa gct ggc gta gtc ggg cac gtc gta ggg gta gag ccc gct ggg gtc c-3′). The PCR product was confirmed by sequencing and cloned into the HindIII/EcoRI sites of pEGFPN1 vector to produce p50RhoGAP-HA. Mammalian expression vectors encoding ExoS(1–234), ExoS(1–234)R146K, ExoS(E381D), and GFP-Cdc42 have been described previously (6Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% new born calf serum, 1.4% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Subconfluent lawns of CHO cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as suggested by the manufacturer. Total transfected DNA was normalized with pCMV-luciferase. Subcellular Fractionation—Twenty-four hours post-transfection, CHO cells were harvested and suspended in cold homogenization buffer 1 (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). The cells were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min and suspended in cold homogenization buffer 2 (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1% protease inhibitors mixture III (Roche Applied Science), and 0.5 mm EDTA). The cells were broken by passage (14–20 times) through a 25-gauge ⅝-inch needle in homogenization buffer 2 followed by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The insoluble material (membrane fraction) was dissolved in homogenization buffer 2 containing 1% Triton X-100 and mixed with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. The fractions were boiled for at least 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Fluorescent Microscopy—At 24 h post-transfection, CHO cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Actin cytoskeleton was detected by fixing cells with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3–5 min and staining with Alexa-546 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min. The cells were washed and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Analysis—The proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (13.5% separating gel) followed by ECL Western blot analysis (PicoWest, Pierce), using the indicated primary antibody and its cognate secondary antibody. The images were developed by a FluorChem8900, and the densities of immunoreactive signals were quantified by densitometry. Knockdown RhoGDI Expression Using RhoGDI siRNA—RhoGDI siRNA, control siRNA with fluorescein conjugate, transfection reagent, and transfection medium were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. siRNA transfection was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HeLa cells at 40–50% confluency were transfected with a mixture of siRNA and transfection reagent in complete medium without antibiotics. The expression of RhoGDI was monitored for 24–72 h post-transfection, during which cells were resplit and retransfected with siRNA when the transfected cells reach confluency. Immunofluorescent Staining of the Actin Cytoskeleton, RhoGDI, and ExoS(1–234)HA—HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 10 min. The permeabilized cells were incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human RhoGDI antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and/or a monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibody. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies with different fluorescein conjugates. The endogenous RhoGDI was labeled with a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green), and ExoS(1–234)HA was labeled with a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 (red). The actin cytoskeleton was stained either by phalloidin Alexa Fluor 546 (red) or 448 (green). Expression and Characterization of GFP-RhoGDI in CHO Cells—To investigate the roles of RhoGDI in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by ExoS RhoGAP, pEGFP-RhoGDI was engineered to express RhoGDI as a GFP fusion protein. This is the first reported GFP fusion protein of RhoGDI-1 that allowed live visualization of RhoGDI expression in mammalian cells. When transiently transfected into CHO cells at 20 ng/ml DNA concentration, GFP-RhoGDI was expressed and present in the cytosol of cultured CHO cells (Fig. 1A). The expression and cytosolic localization of GFP-RhoGDI was further confirmed in a fractionation analysis using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1B). Anti-GFP antibody detected a 55-kDa cytosolic protein, which is similar to the predicted size of GFP-RhoGDI, indicating like native RhoGDI, GFP-RhoGDI was expressed as a stable cytosolic protein. Unlike GFP, which was diffuse in both cytosol and nucleus, GFP-RhoGDI did not localize in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Although transient transfection with 20 ng/ml pEGFP-RhoGDI (Fig. 1A) did not elicit cell rounding, transfection with higher concentrations of pEGFP-RhoGDI stimulated a dose-dependent cell rounding (Fig. 1C). Transient transfection of CHO cells with pEGFP-RhoGDI at concentrations from 50 to 400 ng/ml yielded 60–380 ng of GFP-RhoGDI/106 cells, respectively, which was 0.5–4-fold greater than the reported endogenous RhoGDI (28Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GFP-RhoGDI was not cytotoxic to CHO cells, because the expression of GFP, which served as a cell viability marker (4Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was not affected by GFP-RhoGDI expression (Fig. 1C, inset). Together, these data indicated that GFP-RhoGDI was functional as native RhoGDI, as observed by microinjection of RhoGDI-γ or transfection of DNA encoding nonfusion forms of RhoGDI (RhoGDI-1) in mammalian cells (29Leffers H. Nielsen M.S. Andersen A.H. Honore B. Madsen P. Vandekerckhove J. Celis J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Miura Y. Kikuchi A. Musha T. Kuroda S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4279-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To further test whether the rounding phenotype elicited by GFP-RhoGDI is due to disruption of actin cytoskeleton through inactivation of Rho GTPases, GFP-RhoGDI was co-transfected into CHO cells with GFP fusion Rho GTPases. The actin cytoskeleton structure was visualized by phalloidin staining after transfection. As previously described (6Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), expression of GFP-Cdc42, GFP-Rac1, or GFP-RhoA stimulated unique structures of actin cytoskeleton, whereas expression of GFP-RhoGDI disrupted the unique phenotypes elicited by the respective Rho GTPases (data not shown). The reorganization of actin cytoskeleton elicited by GFP-RhoGDI was similar to that elicited by ExoS (1–234), the RhoGAP domain of ExoS, indicating that ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI may function in the same signal pathway to modulate Rho GTPase activity. ExoS RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI Cooperatively Stimulated Cell Rounding in CHO Cells—To investigate the role of RhoGDI in ExoS RhoGAP-stimulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, the combined effect of GFP-RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP on actin cytoskeleton was tested. Both ExoS RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI stimulated a dose-dependent cell rounding (Fig. 2A). At high concentrations of DNA transfection (>50 ng/ml), ExoS RhoGAP elicited ∼80% cell rounding, whereas GFP-RhoGDI elicited ∼50% cell rounding. At lower concentrations of DNA transfection (5–20 ng/ml), neither GFP-RhoGDI nor ExoS RhoGAP effectively elicited cell rounding, but upon co-transfection of GFP-RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP, an additive effect on cell rounding was observed (Fig. 2A). Controls showed that ExoS(1–234)R146K, a mutated form of the ExoS RhoGAP domain that does not possess RhoGAP activity, failed to stimulate cell rounding alone and did not enhance the rounding potential of GFP-RhoGDI (Fig. 2B). This indicated that the RhoGAP activity of ExoS is required for the cooperative stimulation of actin reorganization by ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI. ExoS(E381D), the full-length ExoS with a defective ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, elicited a similar additive effect on reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton with GFP-RhoGDI (Fig. 2C). ExoS RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI Cooperatively Translocated Cdc42 from the Membrane to Cytosol—GTP-bound Rho GTPases are active and localize to the membrane, whereas GDP bound Rho GTPases are inactive and complexed to RhoGDI in the cytosol. Changes in the activation states of Rho GTPases can be measured using the preferential binding of Rho-GTP to the Rho-binding domains of Rhotekin and P21-activated kinase (23Sivars U. Aivazian D. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 2003; 425: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is useful for measuring the activation of Rho by toxins, such as cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (25Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Aktories K. Schmidt G. Just I. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but has limited resolution when measuring the inactivation of Rho, because P21-activated kinase binds only a fraction of Rho-GTP within a cell extract (6Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An alternative method to measure the activation state of Rho GTPases is to measure the relative distribution of Rho GTPases within membrane and cytosol fractions (6Krall R. Sun J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfection of pExoS (1–234) or pEGFP-RhoGDI in CHO cells at 100 ng/ml stimulated the translocation of GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol, whereas lower amounts of transfected pExoS (1–234) and pEGFP-RhoGDI (10 ng/ml or 20 ng/ml) did not affect the localization of GFP-Cdc42 (Fig. 3). Co-transfection of pExoS (1–234) and pEGFP-RhoGDI at 10 or 20 ng/ml stimulated the translocation of GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol. As control, transfection with pExoS(1–234)R146K at 100 ng/ml did not stimulate the translocation of GFP-Cdc42 from membranes to cytosol, which indicated that the ExoS RhoGAP activity was required to stimulate membrane-cytosol translocation of GFP-Cdc42 (Fig. 3). In addition, co-transfection of pExoS(1–234)R146K and pEGFP-RhoGDI at 10 and 20 ng/ml did not stimulate the translocation of GFP-Cdc42 from membranes to cytosol (data not shown). RhoGDI(I177D) Is a Dominant-negative Mutant That Inhibits RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP-stimulated Membrane-Cytosol Translocation of GFP-Cdc42—Interestingly, studies performed by other groups showed that RhoGDI inhibited both intrinsic and RhoGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis of Rho GTPases in vitro (16Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These in vitro data were further supported by structural studies showing that the N-terminal regulatory arm of RhoGDI binds to switch I and switch II regions of Rho GTPases and interferes with RhoGAP binding to the same regions (18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In the present study, ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI cooperatively inactivated Rho GTPases in vivo, which indicates that RhoGDI does not inhibit binding of ExoS RhoGAP to Rho GTPases in vivo; instead, RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP function in series to interact and inactivate Rho GTPases. That is, ExoS RhoGAP first converted GTP-Rho to GDP-Rho on the cell membrane and RhoGDI subsequently extracts GDP-Rho from the cell membrane to the cytosol, inhibiting the reactivation of Rho GTPases by GEFs on membrane. To test this hypothesis, two RhoGDI mutations were engineered, RhoGDI(I177D) and RhoGDI(L55S,L56S). Ile177 lies in the center of hydrophobic binding pocket of RhoGDI and is essential for RhoGDI to bind to the hydrophobic isoprenyl moiety of Rho GTPases (18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The residues Leu55 and Leu56 lie in the N-terminal flexible regulatory arm of RhoGDI that binds to the switch I and switch II regions of Rho GTPases. The double mutation L55S,L56S on RhoGDI decreases the affinity of RhoGDI for the nonisoprenylated form of Rac1 (33Lian L.Y. Barsukov I. Golovanov A.P. Hawkins D.I. Badii R. Sze K.H. Keep N.H. Bokoch G.M. Roberts G.C. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 47-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 34Golovanov A.P. Hawkins D. Barsukov I. Badii R. Bokoch G.M. Lian L.Y. Roberts G.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). When transiently transfected into CHO cells, pGFP-RhoGDI(I177D) and pGFP-RhoGDI(L55S,L56S) were expressed as stable GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 4A). GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) showed a different subcellular distribution relative to GFP-RhoGDI(wt) and GFP-RhoGDI(L55S,L56S). GFP-RhoGDI(wt) and GFP-RhoGDI(L55S,L56S) are primarily localized in cytosol, whereas GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) is localized in both membrane and cytosol fractions (Fig. 4A). Compared with GFP-RhoGDI(wt), GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) did not translocate GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol (Fig. 4B). This is consistent that binding of RhoGDI to the isoprenyl moiety of Rho GTPases is required for extracting Rho GTPases from the cell membrane. Interestingly, GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) inhibited the membrane-cytosol translocation of GFP-Cdc42 by GFP-RhoGDI(wt), suggesting that RhoGDI(I177D) is a dominant-negative mutant of RhoGDI(wt). The N-terminal flexible regulatory arm of RhoGDI(I177D) binds to Cdc42 at switch I and switch II regions, but the defective hydrophobic binding pocket fails to extract the isoprenyl moiety of Cdc42 from the cell membrane; thus, RhoGDI(I177D) forms complex with Cdc42 on the cell membrane, which further blocks the interaction between Cdc42 and wild type RhoGDI. As a control, GFP-RhoGDI(L55S,L56S) did not translocate GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol and did not inhibit the action of GFP-RhoGDI(wt) on translocation of GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol (Fig. 4B). These data are consistent with a two-step model for RhoGDI-mediated Rho GTPase membrane release, in which the N-terminal regulatory arm of RhoGDI binds to the switch I and switch II regions of Rho GTPases on membrane (fast step), and subsequently the C-terminal hydrophobic binding pocket of RhoGDI extracts the membrane-buried isoprenyl moiety of Rho GTPases off membrane (slow step) (18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 35Nomanbhoy T.K. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This dominant-negative mutant of RhoGDI was used to test the role of RhoGDI in the actin reorganization by ExoS RhoGAP. GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) inhibited the membrane-cytosol translocation of GFP-Cdc42 stimulated by ExoS RhoGAP alone and also inhibited the cooperative effect of GFP-RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP on translocation of GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol (Fig. 4C). This indicates that GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) serves as a dominant-negative mutant for both endogenous RhoGDI and GFP-RhoGDI to inhibit the membrane-cytosol translocation of Rho GTPases. Together, the cooperativity between ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI on the actin reorganization suggests that ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI function in series to interact and inactivate Rho GTPases, and extraction of GDP bound Rho GTPases on the cell membrane by RhoGDI was the rate-limiting step of Rho GTPase inactivation. RhoGDI Is Required for the ExoS RhoGAP-mediated Reorganization of the Actin Cytoskeleton—Although RhoGDI(I177D) inhibited the ability of RhoGDI and RhoGAP to translocate Rho GTPases from membrane to cytosol, it did not inhibit cell rounding stimulated by RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI. Similar to GFP-RhoGDI, expression of GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) in CHO cells stimulated cell rounding in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GFP-RhoGDI(L55S,L56S) did not stimulate cell rounding (data not shown). This indicates that the binding of the N-terminal regulatory arm of RhoGDI to GDP-bound Rho GTPases on the membrane inhibits GEF-stimulated activation of Rho GTPases. To further investigate the roles of RhoGDI in the ExoS RhoGAP-mediated actin cytoskeleton reorganization, siRNA technology was applied to knock down the expression of endogenous RhoGDI in HeLa cells. Using a control siRNA, which has a fluorescent conjugate, the siRNA transfection efficiency reached ∼ 90%. Transfection of RhoGDI-specific siRNA into HeLa cells, at 68–72 h post-transfection, reduced expression of RhoGDI to 10–20% of endogenous levels (Fig. 5A). The knockdown in expression of RhoGDI was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining with α-GDI antibody (Fig. 5B). Compared with wild type HeLa cells, the cells with knockdown RhoGDI appeared flatter and produced extended actin cytoskeleton structures (Fig. 5B). Although type III-delivered ExoS RhoGAP, ExoS (1–234)-HA, efficiently elicited cell rounding and actin reorganization in wild type HeLa cells, the HeLa cells with knockdown expression of RhoGDI were resistant to the cell rounding elicited by ExoS RhoGAP (Fig. 5C), and cells with knockdown expression of RhoGDI and infected with ExoS RhoGAP retained extended actin cytoskeleton structures, such as stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, indicating the presences of active Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (Fig. 5D). Quantitative analysis showed that type III-delivered ExoS RhoGAP elicited ∼90% actin reorganization in wild type HeLa cells, whereas it elicited only ∼30% actin reorganization in RhoGDI knockdown cells (Fig. 5E). This indicated that RhoGDI is a major regulator of Rho GTPases, and RhoGDI is required for ExoS RhoGAP to elicit reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and showed that depletion of RhoGDI is critical for cellular resistance to ExoS RhoGAP effect. Expression and Characterization of p50RhoGAP in CHO Cells—To gain insight into the functional similarity between the bacterial RhoGAPs and their mammalian homologues, the interaction between a mammalian prototype RhoGAP, p50RhoGAP, and GFP-RhoGDI were tested. The cDNA encoding p50RhoGAP was expressed with a C-terminal HA epitope tag for detection and normalization. p50RhoGAP-HA was expressed as a ∼48-kDa cytosolic protein (Fig. 6B) and stimulated a dose-dependent rounding phenotype in CHO cells (Fig. 6, A and C). Transient transfection of CHO cells with p50RhoGAP-HA at concentrations from 20 to 320 ng/ml yielded 60–370 ng of p50RhoGAP/106 cells, respectively. Like GFP-RhoGDI, transient expression of p50RhoGAP-HA was not cytotoxic to host cells (Fig. 6C, inset). RhoGDI and p50RhoGAP Cooperatively Stimulated Actin Reorganization in CHO Cells—Because the relationship between mammalian RhoGAPs and RhoGDI-1 on actin reorganization has not been addressed, p50RhoGAP was co-expressed with GFP-RhoGDI in CHO cells. As observed for ExoS RhoGAP with GFP-RhoGDI, co-expression of p50RhoGAP-HA and GFP-RhoGDI cooperatively stimulated reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in CHO cells (Fig. 7A) and translocated GFP-Cdc42 from membrane to cytosol (Fig. 7B). As a multifunctional regulator of Rho GTPases, RhoGDI plays an important role in actin reorganization by bacterial toxins that covalently modify Rho GTPases. Monoglucosylation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 by C. difficile toxins A and B blocks the binding of Rho GTPases to RhoGDI and subsequently results in accumulation of modified Rho GTPases at membrane. This inhibits Rho GTPases cycling between membrane and cytosol (36Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29050-29056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although ADP-ribosylation of RhoA, B, and C by C3 exoenzyme does not alter nucleotide binding, effector binding, and intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, it increases the stability of the Rho-RhoGDI complex, which prevents release of Rho GTPases from RhoGDI and entraps Rho GTPases in an inactive state (37Genth H. Gerhard R. Maeda A. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28523-28527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the isoprenyl moiety of RhoA by YopT inhibits RhoA binding to RhoGDI and subsequently blocked the RhoA cycling between the membrane and cytosol (38Shao F. Vacratsis P.O. Bao Z.

The present study is the first report addressing the roles of RhoGDI in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton stimulated by a bacterial RhoGAP that noncovalently modulates the nucleotide state of Rho GTPases, which linked the action of this bacterial RhoGAP to the host regulators of Rho GTPases. Although previous biochemical and structural studies indicated that RhoGDI inhibited both intrinsic and RhoGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis (16Chuang T.H. Xu X. Knaus U.G. Hart M.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 775-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hancock J.F. Hall A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1915-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the observed cooperative effect between ExoS RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI in reorganization of actin cytoskeleton suggests that, in vivo, ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI function in series to inactivate Rho GTPases. That is, ExoS RhoGAP converts GTP-Rho to GDP-Rho, and RhoGDI subsequently extracts GDP-Rho from the cell membrane and forms a tight complex with GDP-Rho in cytosol. This effectively inhibits the reactivation of Rho GTPases by GEFs on the cell membrane. This model is supported by the previous studies showing that RhoGDI prefers to bind to GDP-Rho than GTP-Rho (40Sasaki T. Kato M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23959-23963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GDP-Rho complexed with RhoGDI is resistant to the actions of GEFs (25Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cooperativity between ExoS RhoGAP and RhoGDI is studied by using a dominant-negative mutant of RhoGDI, RhoGDI(I177D), which is capable of binding to switch I and switch II regions of Rho GTPases with the N-terminal flexible regulatory arm but is defective in extracting the isoprenyl moiety of Rho GTPases off the cell membrane through the hydrophobic binding pocket. RhoGDI(I177D) inhibited the membrane-cytosol translocation of Rho GTPases by GFP-RhoGDI and ExoS RhoGAP, suggesting that RhoGDI plays essential roles in ExoS RhoGAP-stimulated Rho GTPase inactivation, and extraction of the isoprenyl moiety of GDP-Rho off the membrane by the hydrophobic binding pocket of RhoGDI is the rate-limiting step. The present study is consistent with the previously proposed two-step model for the interaction of RhoGDI with the membrane-bound Cdc42 based on the kinetics and structural studies, in which the N-terminal flexible regulatory arm of RhoGDI binds to the switch I and switch II regions of Cdc42 (fast step), and the C-terminal hydrophobic binding pocket of RhoGDI extracts the isoprenyl moiety of Cdc42 off the membrane (slow step) (18Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 35Nomanbhoy T.K. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although RhoGDI(I177D) inhibited the ability of RhoGDI and RhoGAP to translocate Rho GTPases from membrane to cytosol, it did not inhibit cell rounding stimulated by RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI. Similar to GFP-RhoGDI, expression of GFP-RhoGDI(I177D) in CHO cells stimulated cell rounding in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GFP-RhoGDI(L55S,L56S) did not stimulate cell rounding (data not shown). This indicates that the binding of the N-terminal regulatory arm of RhoGDI to GDP-bound Rho GTPases on the membrane also inhibits GEF-stimulated activation of Rho GTPases. Small interfering RNA provides a powerful and convenient tool to investigate the roles of RhoGDI in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by ExoS RhoGAP. HeLa cells with knockdown expression of RhoGDI were resistant to the actin reorganization elicited by type III-delivered ExoS RhoGAP. This indicates that RhoGDI is required for ExoS RhoGAP-mediated actin reorganization. Therefore, RhoGDI appears to be a major regulator of Rho GTPases activity and actin cytoskeleton. RhoGDI extracting Rho GTPases off the membrane and sequestering them in cytosol may be the rate-limiting step in Rho GTPases regulation. The cooperativity between p50RhoGAP and GFP-RhoGDI in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton suggests the presence of a similar mechanism of Rho GTPase inactivation by eukaryotic RhoGAP and RhoGDI. Apparently, ExoS RhoGAP functions as a molecular mimic of eukaryotic RhoGAPs to modulate host actin cytoskeleton, and this modulation is through coordinating with eukaryotic RhoGDI. Although ExoS RhoGAP mimics eukaryotic RhoGAP, direct comparison between ExoS RhoGAP and p50RhoGAP indicated that ExoS RhoGAP is ∼3-fold more potent than p50RhoGAP in eliciting actin reorganization (data not shown). ExoS RhoGAP also appears more resistant to the actions of dominant active Rho GTPases (data not shown). This could be due to the different subcellular localization between ExoS RhoGAP and p50RhoGAP. ExoS localized to membranes through an N-terminal membrane localization domain (MLD) (41Pederson K.J. Krall R. Riese M.J. Barbieri J.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas p50RhoGAP is primarily localized in cytosol. Therefore, ExoS RhoGAP can constitutively inactivate Rho GTPases in membrane, whereas p50RhoGAP may only act on Rho GTPases on membrane through temporal membrane localization (42Krugmann S. Anderson K.E. Ridley S.H. Risso N. McGregor A. Coadwell J. Davidson K. Eguinoa A. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Manifava M. Ktistakis N. Painter G. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Dove S.K.

The differences between ExoS and p50RhoGAP in reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and in resistance to the actions of dominant active Rho GTPases could also be due to their different specificity toward Rho GTPases. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that ExoS RhoGAP targeted RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 equally well (5Goehring U.M. Schmidt G. Pederson K.J. Aktories K. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol.

Like ExoS, YopE of Yersinia and SptP of Salmonella are type III cytotoxins that possess RhoGAP activity. YopE is a GAP for Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (50Andor A. Trulzsch K. Essler M. Roggenkamp A.

Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, 2Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The biochemical complex is composed of a receptor, the heterotrimeric G protein Gq (and in some cases Gi), and the effector PLCβ. Ligand binding to GPCRs results in activation of Gαq that, in turn, activates PLCβ. PLCβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to generate IP3. IP3 releases Ca2+ from the ER, which is followed by the activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ influx. The increase in Ca2+ leads to activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pumps to remove Ca2+ from the cytosol. The overall signal is a transient change in [Ca2+]i. In the case of an intense stimulation only a single Ca2+ transient is observed, whereas at weak physiological stimulus intensity the transient is repeated to generate [Ca2+]i oscillations (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, 2Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Because [Ca2+]i oscillations control virtually all cell functions from cell birth to cell death (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P.

A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), the mechanisms for the generation of Ca2+ oscillations and the regulation of their amplitude and frequency are of major interest. Early work supported models in which the regulation of the IP3R Ca2+ release channels by cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) generates agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillations. These models were based on the findings of the bell-shaped dependence of the IP3Rs on [Ca2+]i (4Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) and the generation of [Ca2+]i oscillations by nonhydrolyzable IP3 (5Wakui M. Potter B.V. Petersen O.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, the finding that weak agonist stimulation leads to oscillatory changes in IP3 concentration (6Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) suggested that a primary mechanism of [Ca2+]i oscillations is the cyclical activation of PLCβ. Two mechanisms for the regulation of PLCβ were suggested; one is the direct regulation of PLCβ activity by [Ca2+]i (8Cobbold P.H. Cuthbertson K.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the second is the regulation of PLCβ by regulation of the availability of activated Gαq (9Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i can indeed regulate PLCβ activity to influence [Ca2+]i oscillations (10Young K.W. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20753-20760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, in this model the receptor does not control any aspect of the oscillations after the initial stimulation, whereas it is well documented that stimulus intensity affects the amplitude and, in particular, the frequency of the oscillation (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar, 2Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Muallem S. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).The availability of activated Gαq is regulated by the regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The off reaction in the G protein cycle is the hydrolysis of GTP and the reassembly of the Gαβγ heterotrimer. This reaction is accelerated by RGS proteins in a manner such that the continuous presence of agonist IP3 level oscillates to drive [Ca2+]i oscillations (9Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An open question is which RGS protein dominates the regulation of Gq-coupled receptors in vivo. This is an important question in view of the promiscuity of RGS proteins toward Gα subunits in vitro (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar) and the expression of multiple RGS proteins in the same cell (12Doupnik C.A. Xu T. Shinaman J.M. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001; 1522: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Luo X. Ahn W. Muallem S. Zeng W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It is generally assumed that RGS2 regulates the activity of Gq because in vitro RGS2 shows some preference toward Gαq (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 14Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), although other RGS proteins can inhibit Gαq activity as well as or better than RGS2 (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In addition, the role of RGS2 in Ca2+ signaling and [Ca2+]i oscillations in vivo is not known. The availability of the RGS2–/– mice (15Oliveira-Dos-Santos A.J. Matsumoto G. Snow B.E. Bai D. Houston F.P. Whishaw I.Q. Mariathasan S. Sasaki T. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Roder J.C. Barnes C.A.

A. 2000; 97: 12272-12277Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) allows direct examination of the roles of RGS2 in Ca2+ signaling in vivo. The RGS2–/– mice are viable and fertile, although they are immune compromised (15Oliveira-Dos-Santos A.J. Matsumoto G. Snow B.E. Bai D. Houston F.P. Whishaw I.Q. Mariathasan S. Sasaki T. Wakeham A.

Blumer K.J. Siderovski D.P. Zhu Y. Mendelsohn M.E. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1506-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We show here that deletion of RGS2 increases the apparent affinity for agonist-stimulated [Ca2+]i signaling but without changing the dose response for agonist-stimulated peak IP3 production. Rather, deletion of RGS2 changes the kinetic of IP3 production to increase its steady-state level and, consequently, the frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations.Ca2+ signaling complexes are plastic, and the activity of their components adjusts to perturbations brought about by deletion or overexpression of their components. For example, overexpression of PMCA results in compensatory overexpression of SERCA pumps (18Brini M. Bano D. Manni S. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4926-4935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Liu B.F. Xu X. Fridman R. Muallem S. Kuo T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5536-5544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and partial deletion of SERCA2 results in up-regulation of PMCA4 (20Zhao X.S. Shin D.M. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, critical cellular activities such as Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (20Zhao X.S. Shin D.M. Liu L.H. Shull G.E. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) adapt to the change in the characteristics of the Ca2+ signal. Deletion of an RGS protein that regulates the accessibility of active Gαq is expected to change PLCβ activity and IP3 production and is likely to lead to the adaptation of Ca2+ signaling to reduce excitability. The excitability of Ca2+ signaling is determined by the ability of IP3 to release Ca2+ from the ER, the contribution of Ca2+ influx to increase [Ca2+]i and augment Ca2+ release, and the capacity of SERCA and PMCA to remove Ca2+ from the cytosol. Ca2+ influx is likely to have a central role in determining the excitability of Ca2+ signaling complexes because it determines the duration and frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations (21Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 22Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 23Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, the regulation of many Ca2+-dependent cellular activities correlates with the activity of Ca2+ influx (24Dolmetsch R. Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2003/166/pe4)PubMed Google Scholar).A detailed analysis of Ca2+ signaling in cells from RGS2–/– mice revealed the adaptation of all components of the Ca2+ signaling complex that leads to reduced excitability of Ca2+ signaling in RGS2–/– cells. These findings demonstrate the central role of RGS proteins in [Ca2+]i oscillations and the remarkable plasticity of Ca2+ signaling complexes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Solutions—Fura2/AM was from Teff Laboratories, anti-PMCA 5F10 antibodies were from Sigma, anti-PLCβ isoforms were a generous gift from Dr. Paul Sternweis (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), anti-SJ1 was a generous gift from Dr. Pietro De Camilli (Yale University, New Haven, CT), anti-IP3R1 antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Greg Mignery (Loyola University Chicago, IL), and anti-SERCA2b antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Frank Wuytack (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium). Anti-IP3R3 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-IP3 3-kinase was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The standard perfusion solution A contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 mm glucose. When supplemented with 10 mm pyruvate, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor it was named PSA. The Ca2+-free medium was solution A without CaCl2 and with 0.2 mm EGTA.Preparation of Pancreatic Acini—Acini were prepared as described previously (25Shin D.M. Dehoff M. Luo X. Kang S.H. Tu J.

In brief, WT and RGS2–/– mice were anesthetized and killed by cervical dislocation. The pancreata were removed and digested with collagenase P in PSA solution. The acini were washed and, as needed, loaded with Fura2, suspended in PSA, and kept on ice until use.Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Acini loaded with Fura2 were plated on polylysine-coated glass coverslips that form the bottom of a perfusion chamber. The acini were perfused with worm (37 °C) solution A, and agonists were delivered with the perfusate. Fura2 fluorescence was recorded using a Photon Technology International image equation and analysis system, and the fluorescence signals were calibrated as detailed previously (25Shin D.M. Dehoff M.

The reactions were stopped and the proteins precipitated by the addition of perchloric acid and by incubating the acini for at least 20 min on ice. IP3 was extracted with a mixture of 0.2 ml Freon and 0.2 ml of tri-n-octylamine, and IP3 was measured by a standard radioligand assay (26Xu X. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol.

Lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE, and proteins were detected by blotting with the desired antibodies.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDeletion of RGS2 Increases Dynamic of IP3 Production— Because cells express multiple RGS proteins (12Doupnik C.A.

Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the most direct way to study the role of a specific RGS protein is deletion of the specific genes in mice. RGS2 is the RGS protein that preferentially activates Gαq (14Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Shinaman J.M. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001; 1522: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine the consequences of the deletion of RGS2 on Ca2+ signaling, we began by analyzing the effect of the deletion of RGS2 on the expression and activity of IP3 metabolizing enzymes. Preliminary experiments showed the signal/noise ratio obtained with extracts prepared from the pancreas or salivary glands was not adequate to quantify protein expression. A much more reproducible and quantifiable signal was obtained using brain extracts. Comparable quality of results in brain and secretory cells was obtained only for SERCA2b. Therefore, only data obtained with extracts prepared from brain microsomes are presented.RGS proteins terminate GPCRs signaling by accelerating the GTPase activity of Gα subunits to inhibit the activation of effector proteins, including PLCβ, by Gα (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). The cells may adapt by down-regulation of PLCβ expression. This possibility was tested by Western blot analysis of PLCβ expression. Fig. 1A shows that the deletion of RGS2 had no discernible effect on the expression of PLCβ1, PLCβ2, or PLCβ3 isoforms. Once generated, IP3 is metabolized by IP3 5-phosphatases that remove the phosphate from the 5 position of many phosphoinositols, including IP3, and IP3 3-kinases that phosphorylate IP3 to 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4). To date, eight 5-phosphatases that are grouped into three sub-families have been identified (27Pattni K. Banting G. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We focused on synaptojanin 1 (SJ1), a member of the 5-phosphatase subfamily II. SJ1 is expressed in two major forms, an abundant and ubiquitously expressed SJ170 and a neuronal specific SJ145 (28Haffner C. Di Paolo G. Rosenthal J.A. Camilli P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 471-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the deletion of RGS2 had no effect on the expression of SJ170. Interestingly, the deletion of RGS2 precipitously reduced the expression of SJ145. The significance of this finding to Ca2+ signaling in neurons is not known at present. However, because SJ1 can act on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to regulate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (29Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8262-8269Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), it should be of interest to look at this activity and its behavioral consequences in the RGS2–/– mice. IP3 3-kinases exist as three isoforms, IP3KA, B, and C, which show tissue-specific expression (30Woodring P.J. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30447-30454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 74-kDa IP3KB is ubiquitous and is associated with cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane (27Pattni K. Banting G. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Woodring P.J. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30447-30454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Analysis of IP3KB expression showed that deletion of RGS2 had no effect on the expression of this enzyme (Fig. 1C).The fact that deletion of RGS2 had no effect on PLCβ, SJ170, and IP3KB expression raised the possibility that it might affect the dynamic of IP3 production. Measurement of the time course of IP3 production showed that this is indeed the case. Fig. 2A shows that stimulation of WT and RGS2–/– acini with 1 μm carbachol slowly increased IP3 levels that were the same in the two cell types. However, importantly, the steady-state level of IP3 after 60 and 120 s of stimulation was significantly higher in RGS2–/– acini. The effect of RGS2 deletion on the dynamic of IP3 production is further demonstrated in Fig. 2B, where the acini were stimulated with 1 mm carbachol. At this concentration IP3 production was transient, reaching a maximum level after 2–5 s of stimulation and then steadily reducing to stabilize at a new steady-state level. At a high agonist concentration it was possible to demonstrate that the deletion of RGS2 increased the initial rate of IP3 production and, again, the steady-state levels of IP3 at the longer stimulation periods. Experiments similar to those depicted in Fig. 2, A and B were used to determine the dose response for the peak and steady-state levels of IP3 production. Fig. 2C shows that deletion of RGS2 had no effect on the peak level attained at all carbachol concentrations. On the other hand, deletion of RGS2 increased the steady-state level of IP3 at all carbachol concentrations (Fig. 2D).Fig. 2Kinetic of IP3 production in WT and RGS2–/– cells.A and B, pancreatic acini from WT and RGS2–/– mice were stimulated with 1 μm (A) or 1 mm (B) carbachol for the indicated times between 2 and 120 s, and the level of IP3 was determined. The single asterisk (*) indicates being statistically different from WT at p < 0.05, and the double asterisks (**) indicate being statistically different from WT at p < 0.01. C, pancreatic acini from WT (▪) and RGS2–/– cells (○) were stimulated for either 5 or 10 s with the indicated concentrations of carbachol, and IP3 levels were plotted as a function of carbachol concentration. D, pancreatic acini from WT (▪) and RGS2–/– cells (○) were stimulated for 120 s with the indicated concentrations of carbachol, and IP3 levels were plotted as a function of carbachol concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The findings that the deletion of RGS2 increased the initial rate (Fig. 2B) and steady-state level (Fig. 2D) with no effect on the extent of IP3 production (Fig. 2C) have several implications. The increased rate of IP3 production indicates that in resting cells RGS2 exerts tonic inhibition on GPCR signaling. This conclusion is in line with previous observations demonstrating the constitutive inhibitory activity of recombinant RGS proteins when applied in vivo and the activation of Ca2+ signaling by scavenging RGS protein antibodies (9Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The increased steady-state level of IP3 can result from the increased rate of IP3 production and the reduced rate of signal termination. However, it is significant that a more prominent increased steady state is observed at low agonist concentration (Fig. 2D) at which the IP3 level oscillates (6Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 7Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As was shown for [Ca2+]i oscillations (31Zhang B.X. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24387-24393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the increased frequency of IP3 oscillations will be translated to an increased steady-state when IP3 levels are measured in a cell population. Therefore, it is possible that the increased steady-state level of IP3 at low agonist concentrations observed in RGS2–/– cells may reflect the increased frequency of IP3 oscillations. The effect of RGS2 on steady-state levels of IP3 highlights the importance of RGS proteins in controlling IP3 production and [Ca2+]i signaling in vivo (9Luo X. Popov S. Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Deletion of RGS2 Increases Stimulus Intensity—An increased frequency of IP3 oscillations at a low agonist concentration predicts an increased frequency of [Ca2+]i oscillations, and increased steady-state IP3 levels at all agonist concentrations predict an increased apparent affinity for agonist-stimulated Ca2+ signaling. These predictions were tested by measuring [Ca2+]i in WT and RGS2–/– cells stimulated with carbachol and CCK that activate the Gq-coupled M3 and CCK receptors, respectively. Figs. 3, A and B show that the low concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 μm carbachol had no effect on Ca2+ signaling in WT cells but triggered [Ca2+]i oscillations with increased frequency in RGS2–/– cells. Similarly, Fig. 3, D and E show that 0.5 and 2.5 pm CCK had no effect or induced low frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations in WT cells and higher frequency [Ca2+]i oscillations in RGS2–/– cells. Carbachol at 1 μm and CCK at 10 pm triggered [Ca2+]i oscillations in WT cells but a large Ca2+ transient in RGS2–/– cells. To determine the dose response for the agonists, at the end of each stimulation period the cells were exposed to a maximal agonist concentration to discharge the residual agonist-mobilizable Ca2+ pool and calculate the extent of Ca2+ mobilization at the lower agonist concentration. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig. 3, C and F, and indicate that the deletion of RGS2 decreased the EC50 for carbachol from 4.3 ± 0.5 to 0.48 ± 0.07 μm and the EC50 for CCK from 53 ± 5 to 7.3 ± 2.6 pm. Similar measurements with epinephrine stimulation of parotid duct cells revealed that the deletion of RGS2 also decreased the EC50 for epinephrine in parotid duct cells (not shown). These findings satisfy the two predictions that resulted from the change in the kinetic of agonist-stimulated IP3 productionFig. 3Dose response for an agonist-mediated [Ca2+]i increase in WT and RGS2–/– cells. Pancreatic acini from WT (A and D) and RGS2–/– mice (B and E) loaded with Fura2 were used to measure [Ca2+]i with different carbachol (A–C) or CCK (D–F) concentrations. At the end of each stimulation period with the various agonist concentrations, the acini were challenged with a maximal concentration of carbachol or CCK. The extent of Ca2+ mobilization was calculated from the residual Ca2+ mobilized by the maximal agonist concentration and plotted as a function of carbachol (C) or CCK (F) concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The results in Figs. 1, 2, 3 indicate that in vivo RGS2 is a key regulator of Gq-dependent Ca2+ signaling. The combined effects of RGS2 deletion on the kinetic of IP3 production and [Ca2+]i oscillations at a low agonist concentration provide the first direct evidence for the importance of RGS2 in controlling IP3 and, therefore, [Ca2+]i oscillations in vivo and further support the conclusion that RGS proteins have a primary role in the"

However, the mechanisms leading to its increased activity remain largely undefined. Agonist binding to the cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2)/gastrin receptor (CCK2R), a G-protein-coupled receptor, increases Src activity in a variety of normal and neoplastic cell lines. Recently, we and others (Hellmich, M. R., Rui, X. L., Hellmich, H. L., Fleming, R. Y., Evers, B. M., and Townsend, C. M., Jr. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 32122–32128; Ding, W. Q., Kuntz, S.

Compared with CCK2R, CCK2i4svR contains an additional 69 amino acids within its third intracellular loop (3il) domain. Because CCK2i4svR is the only splice variant expressed in some human colon and pancreatic cancers, we questioned whether CCK2i4svR could regulate Src activity. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were used because, unlike many cancer-derived cells, they have a low level of basal Src activity. We report that, in contrast to CCK2R, CCK2i4svR activates Src kinase in the absence of agonist stimulation. In vitro kinase assay of immunoprecipitated receptor protein showed a 6–8-fold increase in Src kinase activity associated with CCK2i4svR compared with CCK2R. Expression of the 3il domain of the CCK2i4svR alone was sufficient to partially activate Src kinase. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the increased Src activity observed in some pancreatic and colorectal cancers is due, in part, to the co-expression of CCK2i4svR.

Increased activity of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, has been implicated in the development and progression of a variety of human cancers including breast, brain, pancreas, and colon, where it is associated with increased growth, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and metastasis (1Banker N.

The cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2)/G17 receptor (CCK2R), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, mediates the biological actions of G17, including the regulation of Src kinase activity. Recently, our laboratory has identified and cloned a splice variant of CCK2R, called CCK2i4svR (17Hellmich M.R. Rui X.L. Hellmich H.L. Fleming R.Y. Evers B.M. Townsend Jr, C.M. J. Biol.

Generated by intron 4 retention, the mRNA for CCK2i4svR encodes a receptor protein that contains an additional 69 amino acid residues in its third intracellular loop (3il) domain.

The co-expression of elevated Src activity and CCK2i4svR in colonic and pancreatic cancers, along with the demonstrated ability of the other variant, CCK2R, to activate Src in intestinal and pancreatic cells from dog and rodents raised the question of whether CCK2i4svR expression was also linked to Src kinase activation.We report that, in contrast to CCK2R, CCK2i4svR activated Src kinase in an agonist-independent manner. In vitro kinase assay of immunoprecipitated receptor protein showed a 6–8-fold increase in Src kinase activity associated with CCK2i4svR compared with CCK2R, in the absence of agonist stimulation. Furthermore, we show that expression of the 3il domain of the CCK2i4svR alone was sufficient to partially activate Src kinase. The agonist-independent activation of Src kinase by CCK2i4svR suggests a possible mechanism for the increased Src activity observed in colon and pancreatic cancers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs—Six different expression constructs were used for these studies. Receptor constructs containing a C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag, designated CCK2R-EGFP and CCK2i4svR-EGFP, were constructed by subcloning the full open reading frames of CCK2R and CCK2i4svR, in frame, to the N terminus of EGFP using the pEGFP-N1 vector (BD Biosciences). For receptors containing an N-terminal FLAG-epitope tag, designated FLAG-CCK2R and FLAG-CCK2i4svR, the FLAG tag and restriction endonuclease sites (EcoRI and NdeI) were added to the full-length receptor cDNAs by PCR. The PCR products were then subcloned into the EcoRI/NdeI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The third intracellular loop (3il) constructs, designated EGFP-3il2 and EGFP-3il2i4sv, were generated by PCR and subcloned in frame to the C-terminal end of EGFP using the pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences). The nucleotide sequences of all plasmid constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing in the University of Texas Medical Branch Recombinant DNA Core Facility (Galveston, TX).Transfected Cell Lines—HEK293 cell cultures were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stably transfected HEK293 cells were used in these studies because, unlike many colonic and pancreatic cancer-derived cell lines, they have a low level of basal Src activity. Cells were transfected with either receptor constructs or empty control vectors using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and initially selected using G418 (600 μg/ml). Cells expressing the EGFP-tagged receptors or control EGFP vectors were selected using a FACS-Vantage cell sorter in the University of Texas Medical Branch Flow Cytometry Core Laboratory (Galveston, TX). Clonal cell populations expressing the FLAG-tagged receptors were selected using an agonist-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization assay as described previously (17Hellmich M.R. Rui X.L. Hellmich H.L.

Receptor expression levels between clones ranged from ∼0.43 to 1.8 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein. All experiments were repeated three times with at least two independently isolated subclones for each receptor construct.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitations were performed using a modification of the procedure described previously (20Piiper A.

Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (LB) (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were collected and the protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Epitope-tagged receptor protein was immunoprecipitated from 1 to 2 mg of total LB-soluble protein using either an anti-GFP antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) or anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with primary antibodies at the dilutions indicated in the figure legends. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using ECL™ reagent (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Src Kinase Assay—For Src kinase activity assays, A/G-Sepharose beads containing the immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with LB and once with kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Reactions were carried out in 40 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 100 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 μg of the Src kinase substrate, SAM68 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 20 °C. Reactions were stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated protein was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a densitometer and UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT).Statistical Analysis—Data were plotted and analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGastrin Stimulates Src and Focal Adhesion Kinase Phosphorylation in HEK293 Cells Expressing CCK2i4svR-EGFP or CCK2R-EGFP—Amidated G17 induces a rapid activation of Src family kinases in animal cells expressing CCK2R (21Daulhac L.

To determine whether CCK2i4svR is also coupled to agonist-dependent activation of Src kinase, we treated HEK293 cells expressing either CCK2R-EGFP or CCK2i4svR-EGFP with G17 over a time course. An important mechanism for regulation of Src kinase activity is through control of its phosphorylation state. Tyrosine residue 419 (Tyr419) of human Src (Tyr416 of chicken Src) is autophosphorylated upon Src activation (22Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of HEK293 cell lysates, using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated Tyr419/416 residue of Src (p-Tyr419/416Src), revealed a time-dependent increase in the level of Src phosphorylation in cells expressing either CCK2R-EGFP or CCK2i4svR-EGFP (Fig. 1A). Quantification of receptor expression using radiolabeled ligand binding indicated that the CCK2R-EGFP cells expressed approximately twice the number of binding sites compared with cells expressing CCK2i4svR (1.8 pmol/mg of membrane protein versus 0.8 pmol/mg of membrane protein, respectively). After normalization of the level of p-Tyr419/416Src immunoreactivity to the amount of radiolabeled-agonist binding sites, from three independent experiments, G17 treatment induced an ∼2.5-fold increase in the level of p-Tyr419/416Src at 5 min in cells expressing either receptor compared with untreated control cultures (Fig. 1B). Most strikingly, in contrast to cells expressing CCK2R, cells expressing CCK2i4svR exhibited a 2-fold higher level of basal Src phosphorylation (1.9 ± 0.2 for CCK2i4svR versus 1.1 ± 0.1 for CCK2R) (Fig. 1B), suggesting possible constitutive activation of Src in CCK2i4svR expressing cells.Agonist-dependent activation of Src kinase was confirmed by assessing the effects of G17 stimulation on the level of tyrosine phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a Src substrate. Src kinase phosphorylates tyrosine residue 576 of FAK (p-Tyr576FAK) (21Daulhac L. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N. Seva C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20657-20663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of HEK293 cell lysates revealed a G17-induced increase in the level of p-Tyr576FAK in both CCK2R-EGFP- and CCK2i4svR-EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 1C). Pretreating the cells with the Src kinase inhibitor, 4-amine-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2), blocked the G17-induced increases in p-Tyr576FAK, demonstrating a requirement for Src kinase activity. Normalization of the level of p-Tyr576FAK to receptor number showed that G17 stimulated a similar fold increase in p-Tyr576FAK levels in both CCK2R and CCK2i4svR cells (Fig. 1D). Together, these data establish that, like CCK2R, CCK2i4svR can mediate the agonist-dependent activation of Src kinase. However, the increased basal level of phosphorylated Src in cells expressing CCK2i4svR suggest that, unlike CCK2R, the intron 4 variant may also stimulate Src activation in an agonist-independent manner.Src Co-immunoprecipitates with CCK2i4svR—Activation of Src by members of the GPCR superfamily can occur either indirectly through a β-arrestin-mediated mechanism (23Luttrell L.M.

To assess whether G17-induced activation of Src involves an interaction of the kinase with either receptor, we immunoprecipitated receptor proteins before and after treatment with G17 using a polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum. Immunoblotting of the GFP-immunoprecipitated proteins from cells expressing CCK2i4svR with an anti-Src antibody revealed intense staining of two bands of ∼60 kDa in both G17-treated and -untreated cells. Only faint Src immunoreactive bands were observed in immunoprecipitated proteins from cells expressing CCK2R (Fig. 2A). There was no detectable effect of agonist treatment on the amount of immunoprecipitated Src protein associated with either receptor. Src immunoreactive bands were not detected in the GFP-immunoprecipitated proteins from cells transfected with the control EGFP expression vector (see Fig. 2A, V).Fig. 2Src protein co-immunoprecipitates with CCK2i4svR.A, cellular proteins from cells expressing either CCK2i4svR-EGFP or CCK2R-EFGP before and after treatment (5 min) with G17 (10 nm) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with a goat anti-GFP antiserum. Src protein was detected by Western blotting (WB) with anti-Src antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). (Controls: Ab, anti-GFP antibody immunoprecipitated without cell lysate; V, anti-GFP-immunoprecipitated proteins from cells transfected with the EGFP vector.)

GFP-immunoreactive bands consistent with the predicted size of the receptor-EGFP fusion protein were detected in the immunoprecipitated proteins from both CCK2R- and CCK2i4svR-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). The relative difference in the amounts of receptor detected by immunoblotting and radiolabeled ligand binding were similar. Densitometric analyses of Western blots using revealed 2-fold less receptors in cells expressing CCK2i4svR when compared with cells expressing CCK2R. Radiolabeled ligand binding experiments indicated 2.4-fold less receptor in cells expressing CCK2i4svR. Normalization of the amount of immunoprecipitated Src protein to the amount of immunoprecipitated receptor in untreated cells showed 9.8 ± 0.5-fold more Src protein co-immunoprecipitated with CCK2i4svR-EGFP compared with CCK2R-EGFP (Fig. 2C).CCK2i4svR Co-immunoprecipitates with Activated Src Kinase—To determine the activity state of the Src protein coimmunoprecipitated with CCK2i4svR, in vitro kinase assays were performed using the Src-specific substrate, SAM68 (27Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 28Fumagalli S. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Because cells expressing EGFP-CCK2i4svR expressed ∼2-fold less receptor protein than cells expressing CCK2R, we adjusted the total amount of cellular proteins in the immunoprecipitation reactions to compensate for the difference in receptor number. Thus EGFP-tagged CCK2i4svR was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of lysis buffer-soluble proteins, whereas CCK2R was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of soluble proteins. Western blots confirmed a similar level of GFP immunoreactive receptor protein in immunoprecipitates from both EGFP-CCK2i4svR- and EGFP-CCK2R-expressing cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed an increased level of SAM68 phosphorylation in immunoprecipitates from cells expressing EGFP-CCK2i4svR (Fig. 3A). Densitometric analyses of three independent experiments revealed an ∼7-fold increase in the level of SAM68 phosphorylation in immunoprecipitates of cells expressing CCK2i4svR-EGFP when compared with cells expressing CCK2R-EGFP (Fig. 3B). Consistent with previous data, there was no detectable effect of G17 treatment on the level of immunoprecipitated Src kinase activity associated with either receptor (Fig. 3A) and Src kinase activity was not detected in immunoprecipitated proteins from cells transfected with the control EGFP expression vector (Fig. 3A, V).Fig. 3Activated Src kinase co-immunoprecipitates with CCK2i4svR.A, autoradiogram showing phosphorylation of the Src substrate, SAM68. Cells expressing either CCK2i4svR-EGFP or CCK2R-EGFP were stimulated with G17 (10 nm) for the indicated times. Either 2 mg of LB-soluble proteins from CCK2i4svR-EGFP cells or 1 mg from CCK2i4svR-EGFP cells was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-GFP antibody and assayed for Src kinase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of immunoprecipitated receptor protein was determined by Western blotting (WB) with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody.

Increased levels of Src kinase activity co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-CCK2i4svR. The differences in receptor expression between lanes 1 and 3 andlanes 2 and 4 were 2.5- and 3.5-fold, respectively. D, summary data from three independent experiments showing the relative Src kinase activity corrected for receptor number that co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-CCK R clone shown in lane 1 and the FLAG-CCK2i4svR clone in lane 3 (*, p2< 0.05, FLAG-CCK2R versus FLAG-CCK2i4svR).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To exclude the possibility that the EGFP tag was affecting the interaction of CCK2i4svR with Src, we repeated the immunoprecipitation experiments using cell lysates from HEK293 cells stably transfected with either N-terminal FLAG-tagged CCK2i4svR (FLAG-CCK2i4svR) or CCK2R (FLAG-CCK2R). A comparison of two clonal lines expressing FLAG-CCK2Rtotwo clonal lines expressing FLAG-CCK2i4svR showed increased Src kinase activity co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-CCK2i4svR (Fig. 3C). Normalization of the level of SAM68 phosphorylation to receptor number showed about 10-fold more Src kinase activity co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-CCK2i4svR compared with FLAG-CCK2R (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that the increased Src kinase activity co-immunoprecipitated with CCK2i4svR is not dependent on either the location (N-terminal versus C-terminal) or character (FLAG versus EGFP) of the epitope tag.The Third Intracellular Loop Domain of CCK2i4svR Co-immunoprecipitates with Activated Src Kinase—Retention of intron 4 during RNA processing results in a CCK2i4svR mRNA that encodes a receptor protein containing an additional 69 amino acid residues within its 3il domain (17Hellmich M.R.

Src binds the β2-adrenergic receptor via a phosphorylated tyrosine residue (Tyr350), which creates a conditional SH2 binding site on the agonist-activated receptor (25Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C.

To determine whether the 3il domain of CCK2i4svR was sufficient to immunoprecipitate Src kinase activity, we generated plasmid constructs that expressed only the 3il domain of either CCK2i4svR (amino acid residues Arg242–Arg399) or CCK2R (amino acid residues Arg242–Arg330) fused in frame to the C terminus of EGFP. Western blot analysis with either an antibody to the 69-amino acid insertion of CCK2i4svR or GFP confirmed expression of the EGFP-3il2i4sv and EGFP-3il2 in whole cell lysates of transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). Western blot analysis also confirmed the presence of EGFP-3il2i4sv and EGFP-3il2 proteins in GFP-immunoprecipitated proteins (Fig. 4B), and in vitro Src kinase assays revealed an increased level of SAM68 phosphorylation in cells expressing EGFP-3il2i4sv"
https://openalex.org/W2030667587,"A four-gene operon (nrcDEFN) was identified within a conjugative element that allows Thermus thermophilus to use nitrate as an electron acceptor. Three of them encode homologues to components of bacterial respiratory chains: NrcD to ferredoxins; NrcF to iron-sulfur-containing subunits of succinate-quinone oxidoreductase (SQR); and NrcN to type-II NADH dehydrogenases (NDHs). The fourth gene, nrcE, encodes a membrane protein with no homologues in the protein data bank. Nitrate reduction with NADH was catalyzed by membrane fractions of the wild type strain, but was severely impaired in nrc::kat insertion mutants. A fusion to a thermophilic reporter gene was used for the first time in Thermus spp. to show that expression of nrc required the presence of nitrate and anoxic conditions. Therefore, a role for the nrc products as a new type of membrane NDH specific for nitrate respiration was deduced. Consistent with this, nrc::kat mutants grew more slowly than the wild type strain under anaerobic conditions, but not in the presence of oxygen. The oligomeric structure of this Nrc-NDH was deduced from the analysis of insertion mutants and a two-hybrid bacterial system. Attachment to the membrane of NrcD, NrcF, and NrcN was dependent on NrcE, whose cytoplasmic C terminus interacts with the three proteins. Interactions were also detected between NrcN and NrcF. Inactivation of nrcF produced solubilization of NrcN, but not of NrcD. These data lead us to conclude that the Nrc proteins form a distinct third type of bacterial respiratory NDH.

Many facultative anaerobes adapt their respiratory electron-transport chains to changing environmental conditions by synthesizing specific primary dehydrogenases and final reductases (or oxidases) (1Richardson D.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). As a paradigmatic example, Escherichia coli encodes up to 15 primary dehydrogenases and 10 final reductases, many of which appear to be biochemically redundant (2Poole R.K. Cook G.M. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2000; 43: 165-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these enzymes actually show differences, such as substrate affinity, or the ability to couple electron transport to proton or sodium extrusion (3Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), which are adapted to specific growth conditions. Therefore, there is a sophisticated regulatory network of transcriptional controls that finely tunes their expression according to environmental signals and leads to the coexistence of a limited number of dehydrogenase-reductase pairs in a given cell. Regulatory elements responding to dioxygen and to diverse electron acceptors are the major environmental factors responsible for such transcriptional tuning, allowing a hierarchical expression of final reductases and, in some cases, appropriate dehydrogenase(s), even when different electron acceptors are simultaneously present (3Unden G. Bongaerts J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar).Two types of NADH dehydrogenases (NDHs) 1The abbreviations used are: NDH, NADH dehydrogenases; kbp, kilobase pair; NR, nitrate reductase; RT, reverse transcriptase; SQR, succinate-quinone oxidoreductase; HQNO, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide.1The abbreviations used are: NDH, NADH dehydrogenases; kbp, kilobase pair; NR, nitrate reductase; RT, reverse transcriptase; SQR, succinate-quinone oxidoreductase; HQNO, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide. can function as the first component of respiratory chains in E. coli and other Enterobacteria. Type I NDH is a H+-translocating NADH: quinone reductase, homologous to the 42-subunit mitochondrial respiratory complex I (4Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In E. coli, this enzyme consists of 14 subunits and a large number of prosthetic groups and redox centers (5Gennis R.P. Stewart V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 217-261Google Scholar). These 14 subunits are cotranscribed in a single mRNA, which is preferentially expressed under “energy-limited” growth conditions (anaerobic or microaerophilic) to provide a higher H+/e– ratio. Under aerobic conditions with highly reduced substrates (“high energy”), an alternative NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, or type II NDH, plays the main role in supplying electrons to the respiratory chain. With the exception of the mitochondria from certain yeast and fungi, type II NDH homologues are absent from eukaryotes. Type II NDHs are monomeric enzymes (47 kDa) that do not couple NADH oxidation to proton pumping, thus keeping a lower H+/e– ratio under high energy growth conditions. Functionally, these enzymes are peripheral membrane proteins containing FAD as a cofactor, which can feed the electron transport chains by direct reduction of the quinone pool (5Gennis R.P. Stewart V. Neidhart F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 217-261Google Scholar).Most isolates of the ancient thermophilic bacteria Thermus spp. require oxygen to grow (6Brock T.D. Starr M.P. Thermophilic Microorganisms and Life at High Temperatures. Springer-Verlag, New York1978: 72-91Crossref Google Scholar), despite the presence in their genome of genes encoding homologues to proteins involved in the anaerobic energy metabolism of other bacteria. In the recently sequenced HB27 strain of the aerobe Thermus thermophilus, a single type I NDH and a succinate dehydrogenase seem to be the major electron providers for respiratory chains toward either low (caa3) or high (baa3) affinity cytochrome c oxidases (7Henne A. Bruggemann H. Raasch C. Wiezer A. Hartsch T. Liesegang H. Johann A. Lienard T. Gohl O. Martinez-Arias R. Jacobi C. Starkuviene V. Schlenczeck S. Dencker S. Huber R. Klenk H.P. Kramer W. Merkl R. Gottschalk G. Fritz H.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).By contrast with the aerobic character of the HB27 strain, the closely related isolate T. thermophilus HB8 can grow anaerobically with nitrate as the electron acceptor (8Ramírez-Arcos S. Fernández-Herrero L.A. Berenguer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such dissimilative nitrate reduction ends with nitrite as the final product, and depends on the presence of a seven-gene operon (narCGHJIK1K2), which encodes a respiratory nitrate reductase (NarGHI), a dedicated chaperone (NarJ), two proteins involved in nitrate/nitrite transport (NarK1, NarK2), and a di-heme cytochrome c (NarC), which is required for the synthesis of active enzyme (9Ramírez-Arcos S. Moreno R. Zafra O. Castan P. Valles C. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Zafra O. Ramirez S. Castan P. Moreno R. Cava F. Valles C. Caro E. Berenguer J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The nar operon is actually encoded as part of a genetic element that could be transferred by conjugation to the aerobic strain HB27, allowing the exconjugant (HB27::nar) to grow anaerobically (11Ramírez-Arcos S. Fernández-Herrero L.A. Marín I. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pulse-field gel electrophoresis revealed that a DNA fragment with a minimum size of 30 kbp was transferred from the chromosome of the donor strain (HB8) to that of the receptor (HB27) during conjugation. As the size of the nar operon (∼12 kbp) was around a third of this, it seemed likely that genes related to regulation and/or the use of nitrate as an electron acceptor could also be encoded within this mobile DNA element. Therefore, we wondered whether anaerobically expressed genes could also form part of this element to render the receptor cells optimally suited for anaerobic growth.In this work we describe the presence of a four-gene operon (nrcDEFN) within this mobile DNA element that confers on the receptor cells the ability to grow anaerobically. We demonstrate that the nrc operon encodes a dedicated new type of primary dehydrogenase that is synthesized in parallel with the nitrate reductase (NR), leading to a complete respiratory chain with nitrate as the final electron acceptor. We present evidence to support the hypothesis that the nrc operon makes the organism capable of a more efficient anaerobic growth by using nitrate as an electron acceptor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Table I sets out the details of the description and origin of the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work. E. coli was grown in LB (12Lennox E.X. Virology. 1955; 1: 190-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) at 37 or 30 °C. Kanamycin (30 mg/liter), ampicillin (100 mg/liter), and/or chloramphenicol (20 mg/liter) were used as required. Aerobic growth of T. thermophilus was conducted at 70 °C with shaking (150 rpm) in TB (8Ramírez-Arcos S. Fernández-Herrero L.A. Berenguer J. Biochim. Biophys.

For anaerobic growth, cells grown under aerobic conditions were inoculated in 10-ml cultures of TB with KNO3 (40 mm), and subsequently incubated in 15-ml tubes filled to the top with mineral oil and screw-capped.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidDescriptionRef. or sourceE. coli DH5αsupE44, ΔlacU169 (Φ80 lacZM15), hsdR17, recA, endA1, gyrA96, thi-1, relA114Hanahan D.

Because of the low solubility of oxygen at high temperatures, and its consumption by growing bacteria, unshaken cultures rapidly become anaerobic. Cells were kept in such conditions for 4–7 h before being processed.T. thermophilus transformation was achieved on naturally competent cells (13de Grado M. Castán P. Berenguer J. Plasmid. 1999; 42: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli was carried out as described (14Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8123) Google Scholar). Plates containing the appropriate antibiotic(s) and concentrations were used for selection.Nucleic Acid Techniques—DNA isolation, plasmid purification, restriction analysis, and plasmid construction were developed as described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). Automatic methods (Applied Biosystems) were used for sequencing. RNA was purified with the Tri-Reagent-ls kit (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). PCR and RT-PCR of the experiment shown in Fig. 3 were performed with the DNA polymerase from T. thermophilus, and the Retrotools kit as described by the manufacturer (BIOTOOLS B&M, Madrid, Spain). For long mRNA, 2 ng of purified single-stranded DNA binding protein from T. thermophilus were added to improve the RT-PCR (16Perales C. Cava F. Meijer W.J. Berenguer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 6473-6480Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For semiquantitative RT-PCR the Ready-To-Go™ kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Appropriate primers (Table II) and PCR conditions were used. Northern and Southern blots were done as described, and specific RNA or DNA was detected with 32P-labeled DNA probes (15Sambrook J.

Open table in a new tab Cloning of the nrc Operon—The nrc operon was cloned from a T. thermophilus HB8 gene library constructed in λEMBL3 (17Fernández-Herrero L.A. Badet-Denisot M.A. Badet B. Berenguer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled probes from the 5′ extreme of the nar operon (narC gene) were used for screening. Positive clones were analyzed by enzyme restriction, and adequate DNA restriction fragments were subcloned into pUC119 for sequencing purposes. The plasmid pUP3b (Table I), which contains the whole nrc operon, was selected.Isolation of nrc Mutants—nrc::kat mutants were obtained by insertion of the kat gene, which encodes a thermostable resistance to kanamycin (18Lasa I. Castón J.R. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Pedro M.A. Berenguer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 11: 1555-1564Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) at appropriate restriction sites of the target gene, always maintaining the same transcription direction of the operon to allow the expression of downstream genes. Previous work on the role of narC allowed us to ensure the transcription of downstream genes after insertion of the kat cassette (10Zafra O. Ramirez S. Castan P. Moreno R. Cava F. Valles C. Caro E. Berenguer J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To inactivate nrcF, the kat gene was inserted into a XhoI site, which led to the truncation of the NrcF protein at amino acid position 151. nrcN was inactivated by inserting the kat gene at a PstI site, which caused truncation of the NrcN sequence at amino acid position 304. Inactivation of nrcE required the insertion of kat gene at a NcoI site, leading to a truncated NrcE protein of 310 amino acids that included the whole membrane domain. Plasmids containing the inserted kat genes were used to transform T. thermophilus HB8 to obtain the expected replacement after homologous recombination. Those colonies that grew after 48 h at 70 °C on plates containing kanamycin were analyzed for the presence of the expected mutation by PCR and Southern blot.The suicidal plasmid pKUPRBSβgal was used for the insertion of the bgaA gene into nrcN. This plasmid is a pK18 (Table I) derivative that carries a DNA fragment for recombination that includes the whole nrcF gene and a region from +1 to 492 of the nrcN coding sequence, followed by the bgaA gene. This gene encodes a thermostable β-galactosidase from Thermus sp. T2 (19Koyama Y. Okamoto S. Furukawa K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 2251-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preceded by the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the slpA gene, which codes for the S-layer protein of T. thermophilus HB8 (20Faraldo M.M. de Pedro M.A. Berenguer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7458-7462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After transformation with this suicidal vector, those clones resistant to kanamycin were tested for the presence of the expected transcriptional fusion.Overproduction of NrcD and Antiserum Preparation—To overproduce NrcD, its coding region was amplified by PCR (primers ferred.ndeI and ferred.rev, Table II) and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites of plasmid pET22b (Novagen) to render pET22nrcD. After induction of exponential cultures of transformed E. coli BL21/DE3 cells with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm), the soluble fraction was subjected to heat denaturation to yield a NrcD-enriched soluble fraction. Slices of 10% SDS-PAGE containing the overexpressed protein were sent to a private company (Charles River Laboratories, Chalaronne, France) for immunization of New Zealand rabbits. Antiserum was incubated with E. coli cells (DH5α) for 1 h and centrifuged before use.Fitness Assays and Kinetics of Anaerobic Growth—An insertion mutant in a gene coding for glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh::kat) was used as a wild type strain in these experiments to avoid any putative influence arising from the presence of the kat gene during growth. A spontaneous chloramphenicol-resistant mutant (Camr) was isolated from this strain to distinguish it after the competition experiments by its ability to grow on plates containing this antibiotic. Complementary experiments were developed in which Camr derivatives from each of the nrc mutants were used to ensure the absence of selection bias because of chloramphenicol resistance.Competition assays were developed by inoculating an identical number of viable cells of the strains to be assayed (a Camr wild type, and Camsnrc::kat mutant, or vice versa) into the same tubes containing 10 ml of TB with potassium nitrate (40 mm). Tubes were filled to the top with mineral oil, screw-capped, and incubated at 70 °C. After 24 h, viable cells were plated in parallel on TB plus kanamycin (permissive medium) and on TB plus kanamycin and chloramphenicol (restrictive medium) and incubated aerobically at 70 °C. Individual growth was followed in a similar way, but with each strain inoculated in separate tubes. Anaerobic growth was followed by inoculating identical amounts of cells of a specific organism in several tubes, which were incubated at 70 °C, as above. At given times, a tube was removed from the oven, and the optical density was measured and the number of viable cells estimated, as before. Competition experiments under aerobic conditions were conduced in a similar manner, but using a 100-ml flask containing 20 ml of TB and shaken at 150 rpm.Electron Transport Assays—Electron transport toward the NR was measured as the amount of nitrite produced after 5 min at 80 °C (21Snell F.D. Snell C.T. Colorimetric Methods of Analysis. Van Nostrand, New York1949Google Scholar) by membrane fractions containing 10 μg of protein isolated from cultures of the wild type and each nrc::kat mutant grown for 7 h with nitrate (40 mm) under anoxic conditions. To avoid extensive membrane oxidation during cell disruption, the buffer Tris-HCl, 20 mm, dithiothreitol, 1 mm, pH 8, was used, and cells were ruptured by sonication under N2 flow. No other special conditions were employed during the NADH-oxidation and nitrite-production assays, which were carried out under atmospheric oxygen pressure. NADH was assayed as putative electron donor over a wide concentration range to check for saturating conditions in a buffer of glycine (125 mm, pH 10) containing 20 mm potassium nitrate.Enzyme Activities—The NR activity was measured at 80 °C on entire cells permeabilized with (0.1% w/v) tetradecyl-trimethylammonium bromide (8Ramírez-Arcos S. Fernández-Herrero L.A. Berenguer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1396: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) with reduced methyl viologen as the electron donor, and potassium nitrate (20 mm) as the electron acceptor (21Snell F.D. Snell C.T. Colorimetric Methods of Analysis. Van Nostrand, New York1949Google Scholar). The thermostable β-galactosidase was assayed at 70 °C with ortho-nitrophenyl galactopyranoside on the soluble fraction from disrupted cells. Enzyme units were normalized as described and expressed in Miller units (22Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). NDH activity was tested spectrophotometrically at 80 °C on soluble or membrane fractions (10 μg of protein) by NADH consumption after 15 min, using buffer, Tris-HCl, 50 mm, dithiothreitol 0.2 mm, pH 7.5. Potassium nitrate (20 mm) was added for the assays with membrane fractions. Different concentrations of rotenone ((2R,6aS,12aS)-1,2,6.6a,12,12a-hexahydro-2-isopropenyl-8,9-dimethoxychromeno[3,4-b]furo[2,3-h]chromen-6-one), diuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), or HQNO (2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide) were added in the inhibition assays.Bacterial Two-hybrid Assays—To analyze the putative interactions between the products of the nrc genes, a bacterial two-hybrid system was used based on functional reconstitution of the adenylate cyclase of Bordetella pertussis (23Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). The complete amino acid sequences of NrcD, NrcE, NrcF, and NrcN and the C-terminal domain of NrcE (positions 264–363) were expressed in plasmids pT25 and pT18 as N- or C-terminal fusion to the T25 and T18 domains of the adenylate cyclase from B. pertussis, respectively (23Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Each coding gene was cloned in both plasmids to check for any possible dependence of the interactions on the N- or C-terminal location of the protein within the fusions. Constructions were carried out with the primers described in Table II. Positive controls for interaction between mesophilic proteins were developed by using fusions of a leucine zipper domain to the T18 (pT18zip) and T25 (pT25zip) domains (23Karimova G. Pidoux J. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Two additional positive controls for the interaction between thermophilic proteins were used: (i) the homo-oligomeric glutamate dehydrogenase Gdh (Gdh/Gdh), and (ii) NarG and its chaperone NarJ (NarG/NarJ) from the nitrate reductase, both from T. thermophilus HB8. Positive interactions were detected by β-galactosidase activity of E. coli BTH101 cells cotransformed with pT18 and pT25 derivatives.Sequence Comparison and Analysis—Sequence comparisons and multiple alignments were carried out using the BLAST and CLUSTALW programs (24Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55183) Google Scholar) available at http://us.expasy.org. Phyl"
https://openalex.org/W2150550754,"Inactivation of the hormone-sensitive lipase gene (HSL) confers male sterility with a major defect in spermatogenesis. Several forms of HSL are expressed in testis. HSLtes mRNA and protein are found in early and elongated spermatids, respectively. The other forms are expressed in diploid germ cells and interstitial cells of the testis. To determine whether the absence of the testis-specific form of HSL, HSLtes, was responsible for the infertility in HSL-null mice, we generated transgenic mice expressing HSLtes under the control of its own promoter. The transgenic animals were crossed with HSL-null mice to produce mice deficient in HSL in nongonadal tissues but expressing HSLtes in haploid germ cells. Cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity was almost completely blunted in HSL-deficient testis. Mice with one allele of the transgene showed an increase in enzymatic activity and a small elevation in the production of spermatozoa. The few fertile hemizygous male mice produced litters of very small to small size. The presence of the two alleles led to a doubling in cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity, which represented 25% of the wild type values associated with a qualitatively normal spermatogenesis and a partial restoration of sperm reserves. The fertility of these mice was totally restored with normal litter sizes. In line with the importance of the esterase activity, HSLtes transgene expression reversed the cholesteryl ester accumulation observed in HSL-null mice. Therefore, expression of HSLtes and cognate cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity leads to a rescue of the infertility observed in HSL-deficient male mice.

Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; CEH, cholesteryl ester hydrolase; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; CEH, cholesteryl ester hydrolase; WT, wild type. is an intracellular enzyme with a broad substrate specificity. HSL catalyzes the hydrolysis of tri-, di-, and monoacylglycerols, cholesteryl, and retinyl esters, as well as other lipid and water-soluble molecules (1Kraemer F.B. Shen W.-J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). A testicular form of the enzyme HSLtes is expressed in rodent and human testis (2Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HSLtes mRNA expression is high in early spermatids (3Blaise R. Guillaudeux T. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Evrard B. Mairal A. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. J. Biol.

Immunolocalization of the protein in human and rodent seminiferous tubules showed that the highest level of expression occurred in elongated spermatids. Other forms of HSL are expressed elsewhere in the testis. HSL-like immunoreactivity is observed in the cytoplasm of type B spermatogonia (human and mouse), primary spermatocytes (human and mouse), and Sertoli cells (human) (3Blaise R. Guillaudeux T.

The 3.9-kb human HSLtes mRNA is translated into 1068- and 1076-amino acid proteins in rat and humans, respectively (2Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HSLtes contains a unique NH2-terminal domain in addition to the 775 amino acids common to all forms of HSL (5Grober J. Laurell H. Blaise R. Fabry B. Schaak S. Holm C. Langin D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Langin D. Laurell H. Holst L.S. Belfrage P. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4897-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This additional domain is encoded by a testis-specific exon located 15 kb upstream of the first of the 9 exons common to all known HSL isoforms. The 5′-region of HSLtes mRNA is distinct from that of the other human HSL mRNA expressed in testicular diploid cells. The genomic organization of HSLtes suggested, as often seen when a gene is expressed in somatic cells and in haploid germ cells, the use of different promoters to govern tissue-specific expression. Our transgenic studies of the 5′-flanking region of the human HSLtes-specific exon revealed that 95 bp upstream of the transcription start site is sufficient for expression of a reporter gene in mouse testis but not in other HSL-expressing tissues (3Blaise R. Guillaudeux T. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Evrard B. Mairal A. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. J. Biol.

The role of HSL in testis was revealed by the phenotype of HSL-deficient mice (8Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Male mice homozygous for the mutant allele (HSL-/-) are sterile. Abnormalities in spermatogenesis result in profound alterations of spermatid maturation and oligospermia. To determine the importance of HSLtes in male sterility, we generated a transgenic line (HSLtes+/?) expressing the human HSLtes under the control of its own promoter and, through intercross with HSL-/- mice, produced animals deficient for HSL in all tissues but haploid germ cells (HSL-/- HSLtes+/-, and HSL-/-HSLtes+/+). Our data show that HSLtes is the sole HSL form responsible for impaired spermatogenesis. A comparison of HSL-/- HSLtes+/- and HSL-/-HSLtes+/+ animals revealed the ratelimiting role of HSLtes and the importance of cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) activity in the action of HSL on spermatogenesis and more specifically on spermiogenesis. HSLtesTransgenic and HSL-null Mice—The studies followed the INSERM and Louis Bugnard Institute Animal Facility guidelines and were approved by the local Animal Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden. The HSLtes transgene was constructed from a 1.6-kb HindIII/BglII fragment containing 1.4 kb of the 5′-flanking region upstream of the testis-specific exon, a 1-kb BglII/XhoI human HSLtes cDNA piece containing the testis-specific exon and part of exon 1, a 2.6-kb XhoI/NotI fragment containing the 3′-part of exon 1, intron 1, exon 2, and intron 2, the 5′-end of exon 3, and a 2.3-kb NotI/EcoRI human HSLtes cDNA piece containing exons 3–9 and the 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The vector pSL301 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing the HSLtes construct was linearized with HindIII and EcoRI. Transgenic mice were generated after microinjection of this construct in fertilized oocytes of female from the B6D2/F1 strain (Elevage Janvier). Screening of the founders was made, after tail genomic DNA extraction, by PCR analysis with the following conditions: sense primer (5′-GCAAAGACGGACCACTCCA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GACGTCTCGGAGTTTCCCCTCAG-3′) with 56 °C as annealing temperature. The size of the amplicon was 277 bp. Two transgenic lines (lines 29 and 32) were established. Line 29 was used in this study. HSL-null mice were generated by targeted disruption of the HSL gene in 129SV-derived embryonic stem cells by standard procedures as described elsewhere (10Mulder H. Sorhede-Winzell M. Contreras J.A. Fex M. Strom K. Ploug T. Galbo H. Arner P. Lundberg C. Sundler F. Ahren B. Holm C. J. Biol.

In brief, the cDNA encoding the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein was inserted in-frame into exon 5 of the HSL gene, followed by a neomycin resistance gene, thereby disrupting the catalytic domain. Two recombinant embryonic stem cell colonies were used for generation of two independent HSL-null mouse lines. There was no phenotypic difference between the two lines. A single line was used for subsequent studies. We developed a PCR assay with three primers in order to distinguish HSL-/- from HSL+/- or HSL+/+ mice. The sense primer, 5′-ACTCAACAGCCTGGCAAAAT-3′, was common to both alleles; the antisense primers used to discriminate the wild type (WT) and targeted alleles were, respectively: 5′-AGGTCACAGTGCTTGACAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGAACTTGTGGCCGTTTA-3′. Primers were used at 500 pm (sense) and 250 pm (antisense) with 2.5 mm MgCl2. The denaturation step was at 94 °C for 30 s, the annealing step at 52 °C for 30 s, and the elongation step at 72 °C for 30 s. PCR product sizes were, respectively, 290 and 353 bp. Intercross of HSLtesTransgenic Mice with HSL-null Mice—First we mated transgenic animals of line 29 to obtain male mice homozygous for the transgene. Two males were selected and mated with HSL-null female mice because male null mice are sterile. All pups were heterozygous both for the testis-specific transgene and for the invalidated gene. To obtain rescued male mice, the double heterozygous mice were either mated together or double heterozygous male mice were mated with female-null mice. We therefore obtained male mice with one or two alleles of the HSLtes transgene that were genotyped using quantitative PCR on tail genomic DNA. From experiments to build standard curves, 2.5 ng of DNA was chosen for the genotyping of animals using a Taqman chemistry-based human HSLtes-specific assay-on-demand and a GeneAmp 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France). The murine hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase gene was amplified as the reference gene using SYBR green chemistry (Applied Biosystems) with the following primers: mHPRT-S (5′-TGGCCATCTGCCTAGTAAAGC-3′) and mHPRT-AS (5′-GGACGCAGCAACTGACATTTC-3′). Mating Trials—Four to 11 male mice from each group were individually housed with two sexually mature (8-week-old) virgin B6D2/F1 females. Vaginal plugs were checked daily, and the development of gestation was monitored. Pregnant females were sacrificed for caesarian section at 8–19 days post-coitum. The size of the litter was recorded, and the offspring were rapidly examined for the life status and possible growth abnormalities. Collection of Tissues and Sperm Counting—Mice of each group were weighed and sacrificed. Blood was recovered, and the testes and epididymes were dissected out and weighed. One epididymis and one testis were used for histological analysis. The other epididymis was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until sperm heads (sperm reserves) were counted as follows. The organ was first cut with a scalpel into several fragments and homogenized in 50 ml of 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.005% Triton X-100 (Sigma). After homogenization using three rounds of sonication (12 kHz), an aliquot of the cell suspension was loaded on a Malassez hemocytometer. Sperm heads were counted in duplicate. Western Blot Analysis of HSL—Testis and adipose tissue were homogenized in 4 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain) and centrifuged at 110,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min to prepare fat-free cytosolic supernatants. Samples of 50 μg of proteins from testis and spleen and 25 μg of proteins from adipose tissue were subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and probed with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against the human 88-kDa HSL or the testisspecific NH2-terminal region of human HSL. Immunoreactive proteins were determined by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by exposure to Fujifilm. Control experiments were performed with preimmune serum. No immunoreactive band was observed (data not shown). Light Microscopy Analyses—Mice testes and epididymes were stored in aqueous Bouin's solution for 24 h. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin wax. Five-μm sections were dried overnight at 37 °C, deparaffined, and rehydrated through decreasing grades of alcohol. Sections were stained with 0.2% hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in Eukitt (PolyLabo, Strasbourg, France) for microscopic observation. Enzyme Activity Assays—Tissue samples were homogenized in 4 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. In vitro enzymatic activities were performed as described (12Holm C. Olivecrona G. Ottosson M. Ailhaud G. Methods in Molecular Biology. 155. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 97-119Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-(3)-mono-oleyl-2-O-mono-oleylglycerol and cholesterol oleate were emulsified with phospholipids by sonication. Fat-depleted bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as a fatty acid acceptor. The homogenates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the different substrates. Hydrolysis was stopped, and released radiolabeled oleic acid was measured using a Tri-Carb 2100TR scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). One unit of hydrolase activity is equivalent to 1 μmol of fatty acid released per minute at 37 °C. Measurement of Neutral Lipid Molecular Species by Gas-Liquid Chromatography—Ethyl acetate, chloroform, and methanol were purchased from Carlo Erba. Diacylglycerol-1,3-dimyristoyl, stigmasterol, cholesteryl heptadecanoate, and triheptadecanoylglycerol were obtained from Sigma. Half of the testis was weighted and crushed using a Potter homogenizer with the following solution: methanol/chloroform/water containing 5 mm EGTA (1.1/0.5/0.5 ml). Lipids from an equivalent of 10 mg of tissue were extracted with 1 ml of methanol:chloroform: water (2:1:1). The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm to pellet the proteins. Supernatant was transferred into an 8-ml Tefloncapped vial containing four internal standards: 3 μg of stigmasterol, 2 μg of diacylglycerol-1,3-dimyristoyl:14, 2 μg of cholesteryl heptadecanoate, and 3 μg of triheptadecanoylglycerol. Double phase was generated by adding 2.25 ml of chloroform, 2 ml of methanol, and 1.75 ml of water according to Bligh and Dyer (13Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The chloroform phase was filtered over glass wool, evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 50 μl of ethyl acetate. 4 μl of lipid extract was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a 4890 Hewlett Packard system using an Ultra1 Hewlett Packard fused silica capillary column (5 m × 0.31 mm i.d.) coated with cross-linked dimethylsiloxane (14Barrans A.

Oven temperature was programmed from 200 to 340 °C at a rate of 6 °C per min, and the carrier gas was hydrogen (0.5 bar). The injector and the detector were at 315 and 345 °C, respectively. Protein pellets were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaOH overnight and quantified with the Bio-Rad assay. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 isolation reagent (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Total RNA (1 μg) was treated with DNase I (DNase I amplification grade, Invitrogen) and then retrotranscribed using random hexamers and Supercript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative PCR was performed on GeneAmp 7000 Sequence Detection System using SYBR Green chemistry (Applied Biosystems) as described (15Tiraby C. Tavernier G. Lefort C. Larrouy D. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33370-33376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Human HSLtes mRNA was quantified using an assay-on-demand gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems). 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as control to normalize gene expression using the ribosomal RNA control Taqman assay kit (Applied Biosystems). Statistical Evaluation—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Group means were compared with the control mean using the Mann-Whitney test (SAS software, version 8.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Creation of Transgenic HSLtesMice—To produce transgenic mice with expression of human HSLtes in testis, we generated a 7.6-kb fragment containing 1.4 kb of the testis-specific promoter that has been shown in transgenic mice to drive expression of a reporter gene in spermatids (7Blaise R. Grober J. Rouet P. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9327-9334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Only haploid germ cells express significant amounts of human and mouse HSLtes (3Blaise R. Guillaudeux T. Tavernier G. Daegelen D. Evrard B. Mairal A. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5109-5115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Mairal A. Melaine N. Laurell H. Grober J. Stenson Holst L. Guillaudeux T. Holm C. Jégou B. Langin D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To enhance transgene expression, two endogenous introns were added in the construct (16Palmiter R.D. Sandgren E.P. Avarbock M.R. Allen D.D. Brinster R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Two transgenic founders, 29 and 32, were obtained and bred to establish transgenic lines. Lines 29 and 32 had 5–10 and 2–5 transgene copies, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed on testis protein extracts to determine the expression of human HSLtes. An antibody directed against the testis-specific part of human HSLtes recognized proteins between 110 and 130 kDa in testes of transgenic animals (Fig. 2A). No reactive band was detected in adipose tissue. Because of the low homology between human and mouse testis-specific sequences (2Stenson Holst L. Langin D. Mulder H. Laurell H. Grober J. Bergh A. Mohrenweiser H.W. Edgren G. Holm C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the antibody did not recognize the endogenous murine HSLtes. An antibody directed against all forms of HSL detected human and murine testicular forms of HSL and the 82-kDa adipose tissue murine HSL (Fig. 2B). Intercross with HSL-null Mice—As human HSLtes expression was higher in line 29 than in line 32 (Fig. 2A and data not shown), line 29 was used for an intercross with HSL-null mice. A PCR assay was set up on tail genomic DNA to genotype the mice homozygous and hemizygous for the transgene. Normalized to the murine hypoxanthine ribosyltransferase gene, transgene quantities were 0.164 ±0.014 (0.13–0.19; n = 5) for HSL-/- HSLtes+/- mice and 0.348 ± 0.058 (0.23–0.47, n = 4) for HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ mice. The validity of our assay was confirmed by genotyping the offspring. Transmission of the transgene to offspring followed Mendelian rules. Intercrossing of HSL-/- HSLtes-/- female mice with HSL+/- HSLtes+/- male mice gave the expected 12.5% HSL-/- HSLtes+/- male mice. Intercross between HSL+/- HSLtes+/- mice produced 6.25% HSL-/- HSLtes+/- and 3.12% HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ male mice, respectively. Body and Testis Weights—The body weights of genetically modified mice with various genotypes were not different from that of the WT mice except that of the HSL-/- HSLtes+/+, which was slightly lower (-11%, p < 0.05, Table I). The testis weights of HSL-/- and HSL-/- HSLtes+/- mice were much lower than that of WT mice (-40%, p < 0.001, and -42%, p < 0.001, respectively). The weight of this organ was partially restored in HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ male mice (+18% compared with HSL-/-, p < 0.05, and -29% compared with WT, p < 0.01).Table IEffect of HSLtescomplementation on body and testis weight of HSL-null mice Values are the means ± S.E.Animal statusNo. of mice/groupBody weightTestis weightgmgHSL-/-632.8 ± 2.176.2 ± 4.7ap < 0.001 compared with wild-type valuesHSL-/- HSLtes+/-1133.1 ± 0.973.1 ± 3.1ap < 0.001 compared with wild-type valuesHSL-/- HSLtes+/+429.4 ± 1.2bp < 0.05 compared with wild-type values89.7 ± 5.5cp < 0.01 compared with wild-type values,dp < 0.05 compared with HSL-/- valuesWT1133.0 ± 0.9125.9 ± 5.1a p < 0.001 compared with wild-type valuesb p < 0.05 compared with wild-type valuesc p < 0.01 compared with wild-type valuesd p < 0.05 compared with HSL-/- values Open table in a new tab Histological Analysis—Histological observations reveal that a low number of early and late spermatids and no spermatozoa were found in the seminiferous epithelium of the HSL-/- mice (Fig. 3, B versus A). Furthermore, in these mice, numerous large vacuoles were present in the seminiferous tubules. These vacuoles were absent in the HSL-/- HSLtes+/- mice (Fig. 3C). In these animals, the spermatid pool had notably increased, and rare spermatozoa could be observed. In contrast, numerous spermatozoa were seen in HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ mice, and spermatogenesis generally appeared qualitatively normal (Fig. 3D). In the different transgenic lines, there were no apparent abnormalities in the interstitium. In accordance with our data showing that spermatogenesis was deficient in HSL-null mice, no spermatozoa was seen in the epididymes, which instead were packed with cell debris and immature round germ cells generally identified as spermatids, a number of which were multinucleated (Fig. 3, insert B versus insert A). The epididymis lumen of the HSL-/- HSLtes+/- mice also contained numerous immature germ cells in most instances with a single nucleus and a few spermatozoa (Fig. 3C, insert). By contrast, the epididymis of HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ mice was filled with numerous spermatozoa. Only a few immature germ cells were present (Fig. 3D, insert). Sperm Reserves—Sperm reserves in HSL-deficient mice had decreased by more than 99% when compared with WT mice (Fig. 4). Sperm reserves of the HSL-/- HSLtes+/- animals were markedly increased when compared with those of the HSL-/- mice (20×, p < 0.05) but represented only 2.5% of the WT mice values. In HSL-/-HSLtes+/+ mice, sperm reserves were increased about 10-fold when compared with the reserves of the HSL-/- HSLtes+/- animals to reach 26% of that of the WT. Fertility Studies—The libido (mating behavior) of HSL-/-, HSL-/- HSLtes+/-, and HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ male mice was normal as judged by the time necessary for recovery of all copulatory plugs (10,8, and 3 days, respectively) when compared with WT mice (15 days). The mating trials show that HSL-/- male mice were sterile (Figs. 4 and 5). In contrast, the fertile (12%) HSL-/- HSLtes+/- male mice produced litters with a lower number of pups compared with WT male mice. The presence of the two HSLtes alleles totally restored fertility. The average litter size sired by these mice was normal. Human HSLtesmRNA Levels, Enzymatic Activities, and Neutral Lipid Analysis—We wished to determine whether there was a relationship between the number of transgene alleles and HSLtes mRNA expression and enzymatic activities. Human HSLtes mRNA level was two times higher in the testes of HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ mice compared with HSL-/- HSLtes+/- mice (69 ± 5, n = 3 versus 28 ± 3, n = 4). HSL possesses both CEH and diacylglycerol lipase activities (1Kraemer F.B. Shen W.-J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1585-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We found that hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters was extremely low in HSL-/- testis, whereas the diacylglycerol lipase activity represented 15% of the WT levels (Fig. 6). The presence of HSLtes on one allele restored CEH activity to 10% of WT values. This activity was doubled and represented 25% of WT values in homozygous HSLtes transgenic animals. Expression of the transgene provoked an increase in diacylglycerol lipase activity that was less important than the increase in CEH activity. The number of alleles did not significantly influence the capacity to hydrolyze diglycerides. Triglyceride and diglyceride contents were not modified in HSL-null mice (Table II). Diglyceride levels were lower in HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ mice compared with the other genotypes. Cholesteryl ester levels in testis showed the following rank order between genotypes: WT < HSL-/- HSLtes+/+ < HSL-/- HSLtes+/- < HSL-/-; there was an ≈10-fold difference between WT and HSL-/- mice. This rank order was opposite that of CEH activities.Table IITriglyceride, diglyceride, cholesteryl ester, and free cholesterol contents in testis of wild-type, HSL-deficient, and HSLtestransgenic mice Values expressed in nmol/g tissue are the means ± S.E.

The data point to the unique role of HSLtes among HSL forms expressed in testis and its quantitative requirement for normal spermatogenesis. Multiple forms of HSL have been described in testis. Several protein species with apparent molecular masses ranging from 26 to 130 kDa are expressed (17Holm C. Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W1973247063,"ERGIC-53 is a lectin-like transport receptor protein, which recirculates between the ER and the Golgi complex and is required for the intracellular transport of a restricted number of glycoproteins. We show in this article that ERGIC-53 accumulates during the heat shock response. However, at variance with the unfolded protein response, which results in enhanced transcription of ERGIC-53 mRNA, heat shock leads only to enhanced translation of ERGIC-53 mRNA. In addition, the half-life of the protein does not change during heat shock. Therefore, distinct signal pathways of the cell stress response modulate the ERGIC-53 protein level. Heat shock also affects the recycling pathway of ERGIC-53. The protein rapidly redistributes in a more peripheral area of the cell, in a vesicular compartment that has a lighter sedimentation density on sucrose gradient in comparison to the compartment that contains the majority of ERGIC-53 at 37 °C. This effect is specific, as no apparent reorganization of the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment and Golgi complex is morphologically detectable in the cells exposed to heat shock. Moreover, the anterograde transport of two unrelated reporter proteins is not affected. Interestingly, MCFD2, which interacts with ERGIC-53 to form a complex required for the ER-to-Golgi transport of specific proteins, is regulated similarly to ERGIC-53 in response to cell stress. These results support the view that ERGIC-53 alone, or in association with MCFD2, plays important functions during cellular response to stress conditions.

Cells and tissues sense and respond to environmental stress by activating the expression of stress genes encoding molecular chaperones and enzymes that repair and remove cell damage (1Parsell D.A.

Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar). During hyperthermia, exposure to heavy metals, amino acid analogues, and several other agents, mammalian cells synthesize large amounts of inducible HS proteins, which remove or refold stress-denatured proteins (1Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar). Higher levels of stress-denatured proteins act as regulators of HS gene expression by binding the HSp70s, which interact with the HS transcription factors in the cytoplasm (5Morimoto R.I.

Unbound HS factors are then able to move into the nucleus and activate transcription of inducible HS proteins by binding promoter sequences named heat shock elements, HSEs (5Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar, 6Santoro M.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional activation, some HS proteins are also preferentially translated in a cap- and 5′-end-independent manner, through internal mRNA elements termed internal ribosomal entry sites, IRESs (7Kim Y.K. Jang S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or by the mechanism of ribosome shunting (8Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 14: 414-421Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) shows an organelle-specific response to the accumulation of proteins misfolded by stress (9Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). ER-resident proteins are specialized in the Quality Control (QC) of folding of newly synthesized proteins (10Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Genes of the QC machinery are under the transcriptional control of an interorganelle signal transduction pathway termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) (9Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). UPR is conserved from yeast to man and is characteristically induced and regulated by the increase of unfolded or misfolded peptides into the ER lumen (9Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 11Patil C.K. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In yeast, the UPR results in the up-regulation of many genes involved in QC and also of Golgi-located glycosylating enzymes (12Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Conversely, in mammalian cells little is known about the stress response of protein located in post-ER compartments of the secretory pathway. Several glycoproteins exit from the ER through specific transport receptors (13Herrmann J.M. Malkus P. Schekman R. R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ERGIC-53 is a mammalian calcium-dependent lectin and is the most descriptive marker of the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (14Saraste J. Svensson K. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 415-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar), which is composed by vesicular and tubular structures localized in the pre-Golgi region and involved in bidirectional protein transport at the ER-Golgi boundary. ERGIC-53 cycles between the ER and the Golgi complex and exports from the ER a small number of glycoproteins (16Hauri H.P. Appenzeller C. Kuhn F. Nufer O. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Hauri H.P. Kappeler F. Andersson H. Appenzeller C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 587-59614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It interacts with cathepsin-Z-related proteins and is required for the intracellular trafficking of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin C (18Vollenweider F. Kappeler F. Itin C. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Appenzeller C. Andersson H. Kappeler F. Hauri H.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and for the efficient secretion of coagulation factors V and VIII (20Moussalli M. Pipe S.W. Hauri H.P. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32539-32542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in the ERGIC-53 gene (LMAN1) are responsible for the inherited bleeding disorder referred to as combined deficiency of FV and FVIII (FVFVIIID), in which the secretion of FV and FVIII is impaired (21Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 22Neerman-Arbez M. Johnson K.M. Morris M.A. McVey J.H. Peyvandi F. Nichols W.C. Ginsburg D. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Tuddenham E.G. Blood. 1999; 93: 2253-2260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in about 30% of the FVFVIIID patients, the disorder is generated by mutations in other gene having functional properties similar to ERGIC-53 (21Nichols W.C. Seligsohn U. Zivelin A. Terry V.H. Hertel C.E. Wheatley M.A. Moussalli M.J. Hauri H.P. Ciavarella N. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Cell. 1998; 93: 61-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that mutations in the multiple coagulation factor deficiency 2 gene (MCFD2) cause a FVFVIIID phenotype that is indistinguishable from that generated by mutations in LMAN1 (23Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. McVey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MCFD2 encodes a protein that interacts with ERGIC-53 and, thus, it was suggested that the two proteins form a specific cargo receptor complex that is necessary for the ER-to-Golgi transport of specific proteins (23Zhang B. Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. McVey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The specific function of ERGIC-53 in the export from the ER of several glycoproteins prompted us to investigate its role during cell stress. The evidence presented in this paper shows that both expression level and recycling pathway of the protein are modulated by heat shock. While this work was in progress, it was shown that ERGIC-53 is transcriptionally activated during UPR (24Nyfeler B. Nufer O. Matsui T. Mori K. Hauri H.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our results confirm this observation and, interestingly, show that the accumulation of ERGIC-53 during heat shock is driven only by enhanced translation of its mRNA. Moreover, we found that MCFD2 is regulated similarly to ERGIC-53 in response to cell stress, thus supporting the importance of the role of these two proteins in stress conditions. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-ERGIC-53 (α-CT) raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 12 amino acids of the C-terminal end of the cytosolic domain of ERGIC-53 (immunoblots, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays); mouse monoclonal anti-ERGIC-53 antibody (immunofluorescence analysis) (25Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal anti-GM130 (26Marra P. Maffucci T. Daniele T. Tullio G.D.

Cunningham M.A. Nichols W.C. Bernat J.A. Seligsohn U. Pipe S.W. McVey J.H. Schulte-Overberg U. de Bosch N.B. Ruiz-Saez A. White G.C. Tuddenham E.G. Kaufman R.J. Ginsburg D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar); rabbit polyclonal anti-cal-reticulin and rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-HSp70 (Stressgen); peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell Culture Heat Shock and Drug Treatment—All experiments were performed with the human hepatoma Huh7 cell line. Cells were routinely grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For heat shock experiments actively growing cells were fed with medium preincubated at 42 °C and transferred to a 42 °C preset incubator, while control cells were maintained at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with genistein and quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich) for the same times as HS treatment and control cells were cultured in the presence of the same amount of Me2SO (Sigma-Aldrich). Thapsigargin (TG) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at concentrations ranging between 300 and 500 nm. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in B-buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1% SDS. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred on Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were stained with ponceau red to check that equal amounts of proteins were transferred and blocked overnight in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween-20. Membranes were incubated with dilutions of rabbit polyclonal anti-ERGIC-53, anti-HSp70, anti-MCFD2, and anti-α-tubulin antibody for 2 h. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated was used as a second antibody. To visualize bands membranes were developed employing the ECL reaction (Amersham Biosciences), which was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In Western blot experiments we used the concentration of 10 μg/lane, which was chosen by titrating the amount of protein extract that gave signals in the linear range by the ECL method. Anti-α-tubulin antibody was used to normalize for equal amounts of proteins and calculate the relative induction ratio. Densitometry of autoradiographs was performed by the NIH Image program and values obtained were the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. RNA Extraction, Northern Blot, and Real Time RT-PCR Analyses— Total RNA was extracted by using the TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. 20 μg/lane of total RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde-1% agarose gel and transferred on Hybond N+ nylon strips (Amersham Biosciences). Filters were hybridized with a 32P-labeled human ERGIC-53 SacII/HindIII fragment (27Sarnataro S. Caporaso M.G. Bonatti S. Remondelli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 32P-labeled human HSp70 cDNA probe (Stressgen) was used as marker of HS response. GAPDH transcripts were detected by 32P-labeled EcoRI/EcoRI human cDNA fragment that was used as equal loading control probe. Serial dilutions corresponding to 0.02–2 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) and real time RT-PCR was performed using iCycler Apparatus (Bio-Rad). Forty PCR amplification cycles of 60 s (15 s, 95 °C; 45 s, 60 °C) were run and amplification rates were monitored by the Sybr Green method. For PCR amplification the following primers were used: GAPDH-forward: GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C; GAPDH-reverse: GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC; ERGIC-53-forward: GGG CAG CAT GGG CAG ATT AC; ERGIC-53-reverse: CAT AGA CGC CTC CAG CAG AGC; GRP94-forward: TCC GCC TTC CTT GTA GCA GAT A; GRP94-reverse: TGT TTC CTC TTG GGT CAG CAA T; MCFD2-forward: TGC ATG ATT ATG ATG GCA ATA ATT T; MCFD2-reverse: CAT TAG TGG TGC CTG TTC ACT CC. Transfection, Radioactive Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation of Huh7 Cell Extract—For metabolic labeling Huh7 cells were preincubated 1 h in methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% fetal calf serum. Thereafter, cells were incubated for 2 h in the same culture medium supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mix (PE Life Sciences). 4 × 107 cpm of cell lysates were incubated with undiluted polyclonal rabbit anti-ERGIC-53 antibody in ice-cold buffer overnight. Cells were chased for variable times with labeling medium containing 5-fold excess cold cysteine/methionine. Expression vectors carrying the cDNAs encoding CD8α (28Migliaccio G. Zurzolo C. Nitsch L. Obici S. Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar) and AP-CD8 (29Mottola G. Jourdan N. Castaldo G. Malagolini N. Lahm A. Serafini-Cessi F. Migliaccio G. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24070-24079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were transfected in Huh7 cells cultured as described above. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE and fluorography, were performed as detailed previously (28Migliaccio G. Zurzolo C. Nitsch L. Obici S. Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Pascale M.C. Leone A. Bonatti S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 291-296PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Huh7 cells were grown on glass coverslips. Following incubation at 42 °C, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Only in the case of the goat polyclonal anti-Sec23 antibody the cells were fixed in methanol at –20 °C for 1 min, followed by 1 min at –20 °C in acetone and 5 min in PBS-glycine 0.1 m at room temperature. Cells were labeled with the appropriate antibody and with fluorescein or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted in Moviol and viewed by epifluorescence on a Zeiss axiomatic photomicroscope with a ×63 planar objective. Results of quantitative analysis of ERGIC-53 distribution in normal and heat-shocked cells were performed by analyzing 150 cells/time point and values obtained were the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Electron Microscopy—For conventional thin sections electron microscopy, samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer at room temperature. Samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in veronal acetate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 25 °C, stained with 0.1% tannic acid in the same buffer for 30 min at 25 °C and with uranyl acetate (5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25 °C, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon 812. Thin sections were examined unstained or poststained with uranyl acetate and lead hydroxide. Discontinuous Sucrose Gradients—Cells (7–10 × 107) were homogenized by 10 strokes in a Wheaton glass homogenizer in a buffer containing HEPES/KOH pH 7.3 20 mm, sucrose 120 mm. Postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge and loaded on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, % w/v) made up in the same buffer. The gradient was spun in a SW 50.1 rotor for 1 h at 43,000 rpm in a Beckman ultracentrifuge and 13 fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube with a peristaltic pump. Fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to ECL membranes and subjected to Western blot analyses (30Erra M.C. Iodice L. Lotti L.V. Bonatti S. Cell Biol. Int. 1999; 23: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells Accumulate ERGIC-53 in Response to HS—To evaluate the expression level of ERGIC-53 in response to HS, the amount of ERGIC-53 in Huh7 cells cultured for different times at 42 °C was measured by Western blot analysis and compared with the level of HSp70, marker for HS response, and α-tubulin, marker for the constitutively expressed gene (Fig. 1). These experiments showed that the amount of ERGIC-53 increased with exposure time to HS, in a similar fashion to HSp70 (Fig. 1, A and C). Densitometry of autoradiographs showed that the increase in ERGIC-53 was detectable at 4 h of HS with a relative fold of induction of 2.68 ± 0.25 and that such values remained higher (2.86 ± 0.18) after 8 h of continuous HS. Interestingly, HSp70 presented similar rates of induction (2.6 ± 0.45 and 2.94 ± 0.40) at the same time points. Conversely, between 8 and 16 h at 42 °C the level of HSp70 stayed high, while the level of ERGIC-53 returned to steadiness (data not shown). Accumulation of ERGIC-53 was also measured during the cell response to transient HS (Fig. 1, B and D). In these experiments, the cells were first incubated for 30 (data not shown) or 60 min at 42 °C, then moved to 37 °C and analyzed at different time points. Interestingly, increased amounts of either ERGIC-53 (2.06 ± 0.51) or HSp70 (2.6 ± 0.56) appeared 4 h after exposure to transient HS. The ERGIC-53 level returned normal after 8 h, while HSp70 remained higher at 8 h (1.8 ± 0.2) and returned normal after 12 h exposure to transient HS (not shown). Finally, the cells were fully viable after HS treatment and could be normally cultured and passaged, and similar accumulation of ERGIC-53 in response to HS was detected in a monkey (CV1) cell line (data not shown). Differential Regulation of ERGIC-53 mRNA Expression in Response to HS or UPR—To test whether the increased amount of ERGIC-53 in response to HS was due to increased levels of ERGIC-53 mRNA, we performed Northern blot analysis. The results showed that the level of ERGIC-53 mRNA remained unchanged both during prolonged and short exposure of cells to HS (Fig. 2, A and B). As expected, the same RNA sample revealed a higher level of HSp70 mRNA and an unaltered level of GAPDH mRNA, a marker of housekeeping genes (Fig. 2, A and B). Conversely, cells expressed a higher level of ERGIC-53 mRNA in response to the ER calcium ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (TG), a well-known inducer of UPR that was recently shown to enhance the transcription of ERGIC-53 (24Nyfeler B. Nufer O. Matsui T. Mori K. Hauri H.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, higher levels of ERGIC-53 mRNA were detected, with maximal intensity between 4 and 8 h of TG treatment. To conclusively prove that ERGIC-53 gene transcription is differentially regulated in response to HS or UPR, we switched to quantitative RT-PCR assays, a more accurate method than Northern blot. These assays confirmed that ERGIC-53 mRNA was stably expressed under both transient and prolonged HS (Fig. 2D). Conversely, higher levels of ERGIC-53 mRNA, and of the UPR marker GRP94, were detectable after 4 and 8 h of TG treatment (Fig. 2D). These results strongly suggested that UPR, but not HS, transcriptionally activates the expression of ERGIC-53. This conclusion was further confirmed by the finding that the accumulation of ERGIC-53 protein at 42 °C was not inhibited by quercetin, a drug which blocks the activation of HS transcription factors and therefore the heat-induced synthesis of heat shock proteins, or by genistein, which inhibits the up-regulation of glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) and HSps (Fig. 3, A and B) (31Zhou Y. Lee A.S. J. Nat. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Nagai N. Nakai A. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 1099-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Conversely, both drugs were able to inhibit the accumulation of HSp70 protein in response to HS, and had no effect on the level of expression of α-tubulin (Fig. 3, A and B). Heat Shock Enhances Translation of ERGIC-53—The results reported above suggest that the accumulation of ERGIC-53 protein during HS could depend on an increased synthesis of ERGIC-53 protein, or a decreased degradation, or both. To address these questions, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine in the presence or absence of HS and the amount of newly synthesized ERGIC-53 measured on SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 4B, increased ERGIC-53 synthesis was observed between the second and the fourth hour of continuous HS treatment, as well as between the second and fourth hour at 37 °C after transient HS (60 min at 42 °C). Conversely, no effect was revealed in the synthesis of tubulin that was used as internal control protein (data not shown). In addition, very similar amounts of ERGIC-53 protein were recovered at the end of 8 h chase performed either at 37 °C or at 42 °C aftera2h pulse at 37 °C (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the increased level of ERGIC-53 protein in response to HS was the result of enhanced translation of its mRNA. Analysis of the Putative Promoter and 5′-Untranslated Region of ERGIC-53—Our results suggested that the 5′ of the ERGIC-53 gene contained cis-acting elements regulating either transcription by UPR or enhanced translation during hyperthermia. Therefore, we analyzed the putative promoter and the 5′-untranslated region of ERGIC-53 found in the human genome data base (NCBI ref/NT_033908.1/Hs18_34063). Computer analysis to identify transcription factors binding sites (MatInspector, Genomatix Software Gmbh) revealed that the ERGIC-53 putative promoter (500 nt) contained two CCAAT motifs and five GC boxes (Fig. 5A). The main but not the only CCAAT-binding protein is CBF/NFY, while GC boxes are consensus binding sites for factors of the SP1 family. These sequences are encountered at very high frequency in many eukaryotic promoters, in which they mediate constitutive expression of genes (33Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 34Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Instead, the transcriptional control of UPR-responsive genes requires ER-stress response elements (ERSEs) (34Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). ERSEs are structured in a tripartite configuration composed by the CCAAT box followed by a 9-bp spacer sequence containing a GGC triplet and a CCACG motif at the 3′-end (35Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar, 36Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that none of the CCAAT sequences found in the putative promoter region of ERGIC-53 gene fulfilled all the criteria expected for a functional ERSE sequence (36Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Moreover, as we expected, we found no binding sites for eukaryotic heat shock factors (i.e. HSE) and, interestingly, we did not find either sequences corresponding to known binding sites for the eukaryotic initiation factor TFIID (TATA box) or classic eukaryotic signals for transcription initiation (37Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the ERGIC-53 5′-untranslated region (21 nt) that was previously identified (38Schindler R. Itin C. Zerial M. Lottspeich F. Hauri H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence analysis revealed a striking complementarity to 18 S rRNA (Fig. 5B). In addition, RNA structure prediction analysis (39Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (9968) Google Scholar) showed that the 5′-untranslated of ERGIC-53 might be able to form a stable RNA/RNA hybrid with 18 S rRNA (Fig. 5B). Since complementarity with the 18 S rRNA is an essential requirement for the preferential translation of viral and cellular genes during down-regulation of general translation, we suggest that ERGIC-53 could be preferentially translated by a ribosomal shunting mechanism in response to HS. Intracellular Redistribution of ERGIC-53 in Response to HS—To test whether HS could affect the intracellular trafficking of ERGIC-53 we assayed the intracellular localization of the lectin after different times of incubation at 42 °C by indirect immunofluorescence. At 37 °C, ERGIC-53 is localized in punctuate structures of variable size, dispersed throughout the cytosol, as well as in the central Golgi region which is concentrated perinuclearly (Fig. 6A, panel a). Conversely, incubation at 42 °C clearly generated a redistribution of ERGIC-53 in the cell perip"
https://openalex.org/W2025629158,"Abstract The plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) actively transports Ca2+ from the cytosol to the extra cellular space. The C-terminal segment of the PMCA functions as an inhibitory domain by interacting with the catalytic core. Ca2+-calmodulin binds to the C-terminal segment and stops inhibition. Here we showed that residue Asp170, in the putative “A” domain of human PMCA isoform 4xb, plays a critical role in autoinhibition. In the absence of calmodulin a PMCA containing a site-specific mutation of D170N had 80% of the maximum activity of the calmodulin-activated PMCA and a similar high affinity for Ca2+. The mutation did not change the activation of the PMCA by ATP. Deletion of the C-terminal segment further downstream of the calmodulin-binding site led to an additional increase in the maximal activity of the mutant, which suggests that the mutation did not affect the inhibition because of this portion of the C-terminal segment. The calmodulin-activated PMCA was more sensitive to vanadate inhibition than the autoinhibited enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the D170N mutant required higher concentrations of vanadate and was not affected by calmodulin. Despite its higher basal activity, the mutant had an apparent affinity for calmodulin similar to that of the wild type enzyme, and its rate of proteolysis at the C-terminal segment was still calmodulin-dependent. Altogether these results suggest that activation by mutation D170N does not involve the displacement of the calmodulin-binding autoinhibitory domain from the catalytic core and may arise directly from changes in the accessibility to the calcium-binding residues of the pump."
https://openalex.org/W2086370712,"Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is an extracellular matrix protein that is cleaved into dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) with a highly restricted expression pattern in tooth and bone. Mutations of the DSPP gene are associated with dentin genetic diseases. Regulation of tissue-specific DSPP expression has not been described. To define the molecular basis of this cell-specific expression, we characterized the promoter responsible for the cell-specific expression of the DSPP gene in odontoblasts. Within this region, DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays delineated one element that contains an inverted CCAAT-binding factor site and a protein-DNA binding site using nuclear extracts from odontoblasts. A series of competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses showed that the protein-DNA binding core sequence, ACCCCCA, is a novel site sufficient for protein binding. These two protein-DNA binding sequences are conserved at the same proximal position in the mouse, rat, and human DSPP gene promoters and are ubiquitously present in the promoters of other tooth/bone genes. Mutations of the CCAAT-binding factor binding site resulted in a 5-fold decrease in promoter activity, whereas abolishment of the novel protein-DNA binding site increased promoter activity by about 4.6-fold. In contrast to DSPP, expression levels of the novel protein were significantly reduced during odontoblastic differentiation and dentin mineralization. The novel protein was shown to have a molecular mass of 72 kDa. This study shows that expression of the cell type-specific DSPP gene is mediated by the combination of inhibitory and activating mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2147513612,"Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a number of proteins that interacted with the carboxyl termini of murine epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits. Initial screens indicated an interaction between the carboxyl terminus of β-ENaC and IκB kinase-β (IKKβ), the kinase that phosphorylates Iκβ and results in nuclear targeting of NF-κB. A true two-hybrid reaction employing full-length IKKβ and the carboxyl termini of all three subunits confirmed a strong interaction with β-ENaC, a weak interaction with γ-ENaC, and no interaction with α-ENaC. Co-immunoprecipitation studies for IKKβ were performed in a murine cortical collecting duct cell line that endogenously expresses ENaC. Immunoprecipitation with β-ENaC, but not γ-ENaC, resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of IKKβ. To examine the direct effects of IKKβ on ENaC activity, co-expression studies were performed using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique in Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs for αβγ-ENaC with or without cRNA for IKKβ. Co-injection of IKKβ significantly increased the amiloride-sensitive current above controls. Using cell surface ENaC labeling, we determined that an increase of ENaC in the plasma membrane accounted for the increase in current. The injection of kinase-dead IKKβ (K44A) in ENaC-expressing oocytes resulted in a significant decrease in current. Treatment of mpkCCDc14 cells with aldosterone increased whole cell amounts of IKKβ. Because this result suggested that aldosterone might activate NF-κB, mpkCCDc14 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene responsive to NF-κB activation. Both aldosterone and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) stimulation caused a similar and significant increase in luciferase activity as compared with controls. We conclude that IKKβ interacts with ENaC by up-regulating ENaC at the plasma membrane and that the presence of IKKβ is at very least permissive to ENaC function. These studies also suggest a previously unexpected interaction between the NF-κB transcription pathway and steroid regulatory pathways in epithelial cells.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CCD cells, mpkCCDc14 cells; FBS, fetal bovine serum; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; ROMK, renal outer medullary potassium channel; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AFC, alveolar fluid clearance; MBS, modified Barth's saline. is located in the apical membrane in a variety of Na+-transporting epithelia including the cortical collecting duct of the kidney, the distal colon, the ducts of secretory glands, and the lung (1Duc C.

ENaC mediates Na+ absorption in most epithelia with high resistance and is critical to the regulation of fluid homeostasis, blood pressure, and airway fluid volume. Structural abnormalities of ENaC are linked to human diseases including hypertension seen with Liddle's syndrome (3Hansson J.H. Nelson-Williams C. Suzuki H. Schild L. Shimkets R. Lu Y. Canessa C.

ENaC is a member of the degenerin (DEG)/ENaC family, a group of structurally related and phylogenetically conserved ion channels with diverse functions. Structurally, ENaC is composed of three subunits, α, β, and γ, which share a 30% sequence homology (7Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar). When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes, these subunits are capable of generating a Na+ current. Only fully reconstituted channels have the same characteristics of the wild-type channel, exhibiting voltage independence, relatively low conductance, distinctive cation selectivity, sensitivity to amiloride in the sub-μm range, and slow gating kinetics (8Canessa C.M.

ENaC is subject to regulation by a number of hormones, including aldosterone. Additionally, ENaC activity is modulated by a number of different proteins including serum/glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), Nedd4, syntaxin 1A, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and K-Ras2A (11Gormley K. Dong Y. Sagnella G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 258-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). ENaC activity has also been shown to be regulated by channel-activating proteases (CAPs) (13Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and furin (14Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D.

Although there is strong evidence that direct phosphorylation may play an important role in ENaC regulation, only two kinases have been positively identified that directly phosphorylate ENaC subunits (15Shi H.

Using fractionated cytosol extracted from rat distal colon to phosphorylate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins constructed with the carboxyl terminus of γ-ENaC, Shi et al. (15Shi H.

Both kinases were able to phosphorylate ENaC subunits, and ERK was noted to modulate channel activity in an oocyte expression system. Of note, a third fraction of cytosol was also found to phosphorylate ENaC, but the identity of the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation is not yet known. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we were able to identify a number of proteins that interacted with the carboxyl terminus of β-ENaC. We now report that one of these proteins, IKKβ (the β-subunit of the kinase that cleaves the inhibitor of nuclear factor κB), significantly interacts with and augments ENaC activity. Cell Lines—mpkCCDc14 cells (hereafter referred to as CCD cells), an immortal cell line derived from transgenic mice containing a 2.7-kDa fragment of the SV40 early region, were maintained in culture as described by Bens et al. (17Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on semipermeable supports (6-well, 0.4-μm pore size Transwell polycarbonate membranes, Costar, Cambridge, MA) to confluency. Only monolayers that exhibited high transepithelial resistance were used in experiments. CCD cells grown on plastic were allowed to grow to confluence prior to use. All cells were maintained in defined medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 medium (1:1, v/v), 60 nm sodium selenate, 5 mg/ml transferrin, 2 mm glutamine, 50 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm triiodothryonine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 20 mmd-glucose, 2% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Medium was changed three times/week. Prior to experiments, cells were maintained in steroid-free and FBS-free medium for 24 h. Antibodies and Reagents—β- and γ-ENaC antibodies were generated and affinity-purified as described previously (18Rokaw M.D. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I. Eaton D.C. Benos D.J. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28746-28751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibodies to IKKβ were obtained from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Lake Placid, NY). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Aldosterone Treatment—Prior to aldosterone treatment, cells were placed in steroid-free medium for 24 h. CCD cells were treated with 10-6m aldosterone for 3 or 18 h at 37 °C. Yeast Two-hybrid—Using the BD Matchmaker Gal4 Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech, BD Biosciences), carboxyl termini of α-, β-, and γ-murine ENaC (mENaC) were subcloned into the DNA binding domain vector pGBKT7, and full-length IKKβ kinase was subcloned into the DNA activation domain vector pGADT7 (19Clontech Matchmaker Gal4 Two-hybrid System 3 & Libraries User Manual. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA1999Google Scholar). Competent AH109 yeast cells were made using the Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation II kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA). Yeast were transformed with vectors according to the manufacturer's instructions and grown on solid medium with appropriate dropout powder (Clontech) and BD Bacto agar (Difco). Yeast were grown in a room air incubator at 30 °C. Primers for carboxyl termini of murine ENaC were constructed as follows: α-ENaC, 5′-AAGAATTCCACAGGTTCCGGAGCCGG and 3′-TCGGATCCTTAGAGTGCCATGGCCGGAGC; β-ENaC, 5′-AAGAATTCAAAGGCCTGCGCAGGAGG and 3′-TTGGATCCTTAGATGGCCTCCACCTCACT; and γ-ENaC, 5′-AAGAATTCCGCCGCCAGTGGCAGAAA and 3′-TTGGATCCTTAGAACTCATTGGTCAACTG. Yeast Two-hybrid β-Galactosidase/X-Gal Assay—A standard filter lift assay was performed as outlined in the BD Matchmaker Gal-4 Two-hybrid System 3 manual (20Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook. Clontech, Palo Alto, CA2001Google Scholar). Yeast were permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and β-galactosidase activity was assayed in a Z buffer (Na2HPO4·7H2O (16.1 g/liter), NaH2PO4·H2O (5.5 g/liter), KCl (0.75 g/liter), MgSO4·7H2O (0.246 g/liter), pH 7)/β-mercaptoethanol (0.27 ml/100 ml of Z buffer)/X-gal solution (1.67 ml of stock solution/100 ml of Z buffer). X-gal stock solution was made immediately prior to each experiment by dissolving X-gal in N,N-dimethylformamide at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Filters were placed in a room air incubator at 30 °C and checked periodically until they turned a blue color. NF-κB Luciferase Activity Assay—The NF-κB-responsive gene (pNF-κB-Luc, Clontech) was transiently transfected into CCD cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. CCD cells were grown directly on plastic in 12-well clusters, transfected with 1.6 μg of pNF-κB-Luc/well, and grown to confluence. Cells were placed in steroid-free and FBS-free medium for 24 h prior to experiments. Cells were then kept in control conditions or incubated with either aldosterone (10-6m) or TNFα (120 ng/ml) for 18 h. NF-κB activity was quantified by measuring luciferase activity using standard methods (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Turner TD 20/20 illuminometer with the signal integrated over a 15-s interval. Luciferase activity was measured in arbitrary luminometry units. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—CCD cells were grown on 6-well filter inserts and were maintained in steroid- and FBS-free medium for 24 h. Monolayers were then subjected to control, 3-h aldosterone, and 18-h aldosterone conditions. The immunoprecipitation and the Western blotting protocol were performed as described previously (21Lebowitz J. An B. Edinger R.S. Zeidel M.L. Johnson J.P. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F524-F531Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Equivalency of loading for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation was ensured by performing protein assays (BCA, Pierce) and using equal amounts of protein for each experimental condition. Channel Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus oocytes (stage V-VI) were pretreated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IV) in calcium-free saline solution. Murine ENaC cRNAs (1-3 ng/subunit in 50 nl of H2O) were microinjected into all oocytes. Oocytes in the experimental group were additionally injected with 5 ng of cRNA of murine IKKβ (IMAGE clone 4482634). As a control, αβγ-ENaC cRNAs were co-injected with 5 ng of kinase-dead human IKKβ(K44A) (22Ten R.M. McKinstry M.J. Trushin S.A. Asin S. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3851-3857PubMed Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Carlos Paya) cRNA. All oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (MBS) (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate). Whole cell currents were measured 24-46 h after cRNA injections. To determine whether the effects of IKKβ on ENaC were not the result of generic effects of IKKβ on transcription, protein trafficking, or cell surface expression, we used ROMK-expressing oocytes (23Bruns J.B. Hu B. Ahn Y.J. Sheng S. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F600-F609Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with and without IKKβ. Wild-type ROMK cRNA (2 ng) was injected with or without IKKβ cRNA (5 ng). Whole Cell Current Measurements—A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used as described previously (24Carattino M. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Whole cell inward amiloride-sensitive currents were measured in control oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC alone or experimental oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC + IKKβ using a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and a TEV 200A voltage clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using pClamp 7.0. Amiloride-sensitive currents were defined as the difference of the current in the absence and the presence of 0.1 mm amiloride. Oocytes were bathed in a solution containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.40. All measurements were made at room temperature (22-25 °C), and the bath solution was continuously perfused at 5 ml/min by gravity. Oocytes were typically incubated in the bath solution for at least 10 min before the current was recorded to allow currents to stabilize. Membrane potentials were clamped from -140 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments with a duration of 900 ms. Currents were measured at a holding potential of -100 mV 600 ms after initiation of the clamp potential. For ROMK measurements, whole cell potassium currents were measured at -100 mV in the absence or presence of 5 mm BaCl2. Cell Surface ENaC Labeling—The general approach was based on the method of Zerangue et al. (25Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) as modified by Condliffe et al. (26Condliffe S.B. Carattino M.D. Frizzell R.A. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12796-12804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Control oocytes expressing mouse α-, β-FLAG-, and γ-ENaC subunits and experimental oocytes co-injected with αβFLAGγ-ENaC and IKKβ were blocked with MBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (MBS-BSA) after 2 days of incubation. Oocytes were then exposed to MBS-BSA with 1 mg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. Of note, β-ENaC containing the FLAG epitope (DYDKKKD) at the extracellular loop does not alter INa relative to wild-type ENaC expression as first demonstrated by Firsov et al. (4Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). After the oocytes were labeled with primary antibody, they were washed six times in MBS-BSA at 4 °C and incubated in MBS-BSA supplemented with 1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA)) for 1 h at 4 °C. After 12 additional washes, individual oocytes were placed in 100 ml of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Femto solution (Pierce) and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Chemiluminescence was quantified in arbitrary light units using TD 20/20 illuminometer with the signal integrated over a 60-s interval. Yeast Two-hybrid Results—Initial results of the yeast two-hybrid library screen plated on medium-selective media (-His/-Leu/-Trp) using a commercially available mouse kidney library (Clontech, BD Biosciences) against carboxyl termini of ENaC revealed an interaction between the β-ENaC and a number of clones including IKKβ. Full-length IKKβ was subcloned into the pGADT7 vector. We then screened IKKβ against the carboxyl terminus of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC placed in the pGBKT7 vector. All constructs were transformed into yeast individually and selected for with appropriate medium. Single-plasmid transformants did not grow on medium-selective media (-His/-Leu/-Trp), nor did they exhibit spontaneous β-galactosidase activity. As shown in Fig. 1, only co-transformation of IKKβ with the β-carboxyl terminus of ENaC yielded robust growth on medium-selective media (-His/-Leu/-Trp) after 5 days of incubation. α-ENaC exhibited no growth, and γ-ENaC grew only fine colonies on medium-selective media. However, only β-ENaC co-transformants exhibited significant β-galactosidase activity. This β-galactosidase activity was evident in the β-ENaC/IKKβ co-transformants after 2 h but was robust after 4 h as shown in Fig. 1, bottom. γ-ENaC only exhibited minimal β-galactosidase activity after 4 h (Fig. 1, bottom), which was unchanged at 8 h. Only co-transformation of β-ENaC with IKKβ yielded both growth on restrictive media and β-galactosidase activity. Immunoprecipitation with β- and γ-ENaC Antibodies—To determine whether the ENaC-IKKβ interaction was detectable in a physiologically relevant system, we employed in continuous culture a line of mouse CCD cells that was developed by Bens, Vandewalle, and co-workers (17Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that expresses endogenous ENaC activity, which is regulated by hormones in a manner similar to the intact cortical collecting duct. After immunoprecipitation of cell lysate using specific antibodies for β- and γ-ENaC, we performed Western blots using a commercially available antibody for IKKβ. Fig. 2 shows the result of Western blots with the IKKβ antibody. The first lane of Fig. 2 demonstrates that the IKKβ antibody can detect IKKβ in CCD cell lysate with a characteristic band at 87-90 kDa, identical to its appearance in Jurkat cell lysate supplied by the manufacturer of the antibody (not shown). The next two lanes of Fig. 2 show the Western blots using anti-IKKβ after immunoprecipitation of CCD cell lysate with β-ENaC and γ-ENaC antibodies. IKKβ co-immunoprecipitates with β- but not γ-ENaC. The next two lanes of Fig. 2 are controls to demonstrate that the β- and γ-ENaC antibodies bring down the appropriate subunits, and the final lane is a control showing that incubation of lysate and immunoprecipitation beads without antibody does not result in detection of any protein using the anti-IKKβ. Co-expression of IKKβ and αβγ-ENaC in Xenopus Oocytes Significantly Increases Amiloride-sensitive Current—To determine whether the interaction between the carboxyl terminus of β-ENaC and IKKβ modulated ENaC activity, we used the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Currents shown in Fig. 3 are all normalized to control. As shown in Fig. 3A, co-expression of αβγ-ENaC with IKKβ cRNA significantly increased amiloride-sensitive current by 26% (n = 42 oocytes, n = 3 separate groups of oocytes, p = 0.0007). To determine whether the kinase activity of IKKβ was required for its effect on ENaC, we examined the effect of a kinase-dead mutant IKKβ (K44A) (22Ten R.M. McKinstry M.J. Trushin S.A. Asin S. Paya C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3851-3857PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows that co-expression of αβγ-ENaC and kinase-dead IKKβ(K44A) resulted in a 50% decrease in normalized currents (n = 47, n = 3, p < 0.001). We examined the effects of IKKβ and kinase-dead IKKβ on the expression of a distinct ion channel, ROMK (23Bruns J.B. Hu B. Ahn Y.J. Sheng S. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 285: F600-F609Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, C and D, shows the effect of IKKβ and IKKβ(K44A) co-expression with ROMK. Neither construct appears to have a significant effect on barium-sensitive K+ current, suggesting that IKKβ activation and IKKβ(K44A)-mediated down-regulation of channel activity are ENaC-specific effects. Co-expression of IKKβ Increases Surface Expression of ENaC—Surface expression of ENaC is shown in Fig. 4. As measured by chemiluminescence, there is a 30% increase in signal with co-expression of IKKβ and αβFLAGγ-ENaC as compared with controls expressing αβFLAGγ-ENaC alone. This 30% increase in surface expression of ENaC parallels the increase in amiloride-sensitive current induced by IKKβ, implying that the mechanism of IKKβ-mediated ENaC up-regulation is secondary to an increase in the number of channels at the surface rather than an increase in open probability. IKKβ Is An Aldosterone-regulated Protein—Given that ENaC is responsive to aldosterone, we sought to determine whether IKKβ is regulated by aldosterone. CCD cell monolayers were exposed to 10-6m aldosterone or diluent for 3 or 18 h. Fig. 5 shows typical Western blot results of CCD cell lysate. Fig. 5A indicates a clear increase in the whole cell amount of IKKβ that can be seen after 18 h of exposure to aldosterone. Western blots were quantified by densitometry (n = 5). Fig. 5B shows these densitometry results as a percent of control. After 3 h of exposure to aldosterone, there is no significant increase in whole cell IKKβ as compared with controls. However, exposure to 18 h of aldosterone increased the amount of whole cell IKKβ significantly (p < 0.02). NF-κB Is Activated by Aldosterone—IKKβ is a serine-threonine kinase that is integral to the activation of NF-κB (27Senftleben U. Karin M. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S18-S26Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28Wallach D. Arumugam T.U. Boldin M.P. Cantarella G. Ganesh K.A. Goltsev Y. Goncharov T.M. Kovalenko A.V. Rajput A. Varfolomeev E.E.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). To determine whether aldosterone has a direct effect on the transcription of NF-κB-sensitive genes in this cell line, we transiently transfected CCD cells with an NF-κB-sensitive luciferase reporter gene. As noted in Fig. 6, cells exposed to 18 h of aldosterone or TNFα exhibited a significant increase in luciferase activity as compared with transfected controls. There was no statistical difference between the aldosterone response when compared with the response of TNFα. Our present studies show that there is a physiologically meaningful interaction between the carboxyl terminus of β-ENaC and IKKβ kinase. The true two-hybrid demonstrated a robust interaction between β-ENaC and IKKβ. This interaction was confirmed using immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies to ENaC subunits. The immunoprecipitation results confirmed that the interaction is exclusive to β-ENaC. The physiological relevance of this interaction was demonstrated by augmentation of ENaC activity as measured by amiloride-sensitive current when IKKβ and αβγ-ENaC are co-expressed in the Xenopus oocyte system. Kinase-dead IKKβ had the opposite effect with a decrease in amiloride-sensitive current. The change in ENaC activity appears to be because of an increase in surface expression, as opposed to changes in open probability, as measured by the chemiluminescence assay in oocytes. The effects of IKKβ are specific to ENaC because co-expression of IKKβ or IKKβ(K44A) and ROMK did not affect whole cell K+ currents. It appears that the kinase activity of IKKβ is required for its effects on ENaC. Kinase-dead IKKβ not only blocked the stimulation by IKKβ but also markedly reduced ENaC activity. The dramatic decrease in ENaC activity when co-expressed with the kinase-dead mutant implies that constitutive activation of IKKβ, or a similar kinase, is necessary for a significant proportion of basal ENaC surface expression and that this interaction occurs in oocytes. The present study demonstrates that activation of the NF-κB system through IKKβ may augment both NF-κB-mediated transcription and ENaC activity. Although a direct interaction between ENaC and IKKβ has never been proposed, the groundwork establishing a link between ENaC activity and inflammation/apoptosis has been established. Fukuda et al. (30Fukuda N. Jayr C. Lazrak A. Wang Y. Lucas R. Matalon S. Matthay M.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Amiloride was shown to block basal AFC and also blocked TNFα-induced up-regulation of AFC, implying that the TNFα-mediated increase in fluid clearance was because of up-regulation of ENaC. In separate experiments, A549 cells, an immortal cell line that possesses characteristics of type II alveolar cells, were exposed to TNFα and were noted to have an 85% increase in amiloride-sensitive current as measured by whole cell patch clamping. TNFα has also been shown to increase AFC during acute bacterial pneumonia (31Rezaiguia S. Garat C. Delclaux C. Meignan M. Fleury J. Legrand P. Matthay M.A. Jayr C. J. Clin.

This sodium retention is blocked by amiloride, indicating that this sodium retention is mediated by ENaC. These results confirm the relationship of TNFα and ENaC activation and imply a connection between the activation of ENaC and stimulation of NF-κB.

https://openalex.org/W2036754008,"Abstract We used 55 Ala-scanned recombinant thrombin molecules to define residues important for inhibition by the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) heparin cofactor II (HCII) in the absence and presence of glycosaminoglycans. We verified the importance of numerous basic residues in anion-binding exosite-1 (exosite-1) and found 4 additional residues, Gln24, Lys65, His66, and Tyr71 (using the thrombin numbering system), that were resistant to HCII inhibition with and without glycosaminoglycans. Inhibition rate constants for these exosite-1 (Q24A, K65A, H66A, Y71A) thrombin mutants (0.02-0.38 × 108 m-1 min-1 for HCII-heparin when compared with 2.36 × 108 m-1 min-1 with wild-type thrombin and 0.03-0.53 × 108 m-1 min-1 for HCII-dermatan sulfate when compared with 5.23 × 108 m-1 min-1 with wild-type thrombin) confirmed that the structural integrity of thrombin exosite-1 is critical for optimal HCII-thrombin interactions in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. However, our results are also consistent for HCII-glycosaminoglycan-thrombin ternary complex formation. Ten residues surrounding the active site of thrombin were implicated in HCII interactions. Four mutants (Asp51, Lys52, Lys145/Thr147/Trp148, Asp234) showed normal increased rates of inhibition by HCII-glycosaminoglycans, whereas four mutants (Trp50, Glu202, Glu229, Arg233) remained resistant to inhibition by HCII with glycosaminoglycans. Using 11 exosite-2 thrombin mutants with 20 different mutated residues, we saw no major perturbations of HCII-glycosaminoglycan inhibition reactions. Collectively, our results support a “double bridge” mechanism for HCII inhibition of thrombin in the presence of glycosaminoglycans, which relies in part on ternary complex formation but is primarily dominated by an allosteric process involving contact of the “hirudin-like” domain of HCII with thrombin exosite-1."
https://openalex.org/W2160751460,"Unlike human hepatic lipase (hHL) that is mainly cell surface-anchored via binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), mouse HL (mHL) has a low affinity to HSPG and thus is largely blood-borne. The reduced HSPG binding of mHL is attributable to the C-terminal amino acids. To determine the functions of HSPG binding of hHL in vivo, we created adenovirus vectors encoding hHL or a chimeric protein (designated hHLmt) in which the C-terminal HSPG-binding sequences were replaced with the corresponding mouse sequences. Injecting hHLmt-expressing virus into C57BL/6J mice (1.8 × 1010 virus particles/mouse) resulted in a 3-fold increase in pre-heparin HL activity, whereas infection with an identical dose of hHL virus did not change pre-heparin HL activity. In hHLmt-expressing mice, the concentration of total cholesterol and phospholipids was inversely related to the hHL activity in pre-heparin plasma in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the decrease was mainly attributable to high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol and HDL phospholipids. The expression of hHL exhibited no change in plasma total cholesterol or phospholipid levels as compared with control mice infected with luciferase or injected with saline. The reduced HDL lipids in the hHLmt-expressing mice were accompanied by markedly decreased plasma and hepatic apolipoprotein (apo) A-I. In primary hepatocytes isolated from hHLmt-expressing mice, the concentration of cell-associated and secreted apoA-I was decreased by 2–3-fold as compared with hepatocytes isolated from control mice, whereas the levels of apoB and apoE were unaltered. Infection of primary hepatocytes with hHLmt virus ex vivo also resulted in reduced apoA-I secretion but had no effect on cell-associated apoA-I. These results suggest that expression of HSPG binding-deficient hHL has a profound HDL-lowering effect.

Thus, HDL are considered as anti-atherothrombotic lipoproteins with cardioprotective properties. Proposed protective roles attributed to HDL include reverse cholesterol transport from extrahepatic tissues to the liver (1Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J.

Formation, remodeling, and catabolism of HDL are achieved through multiple pathways and are regulated by a variety of proteins. In addition to the biosynthesis of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoA-II that are the major structural components of HDL, the metabolism of HDL also involves the function of cell surface membrane-bound proteins such as ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) (5Bodzioch M.

The dual phospholipase and triglyceride lipase activity of hHL is in contrast to LPL and EL that are predominantly triglyceride lipase and phospholipase, respectively (25McCoy M.G. Sun G.S.

These non-lipolysis roles of hHL are thought to occur through bridging lipoproteins (to which HL binds via hydrophobic interactions or protein-protein interactions (32Choi S.Y. Goldberg I.J. Curtiss L.K. Cooper A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20456-20462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) to cell surface receptors. Studies with chimeric proteins have demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of HL, like that of LPL, governs its affinity to heparin (33Davis R.C. Wong H. Nikazy J. Wang K. Han Q. Schotz M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21499-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dichek H.L. Parrott C. Ronan R. Brunzell J.D. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1393-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a chimeric lipase (hHLmt) expressed in a cell culture system, we have demonstrated that a region encompassing the C-terminal 70 amino acids of hHL confers high affinity to HSPG (35Brown R.J.

The physiological significance of hHL binding to HSPG, especially with respect to its lipolysis activity, remains unclear. Previous in vitro and cell culture studies have demonstrated that hHL can be displaced from purified HSPG (36Ramsamy T.A. Neville T.A. Chauhan B.M. Aggarwal D. Sparks D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33480-33486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cell surfaces (37Ramsamy T.A. Boucher J. Brown R.J. Yao Z. Sparks D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 733-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by exogenous HDL and by apoA-I but not by other lipoproteins. The displacement of hHL resulted in increased hydrolysis of very low density lipoproteins. The plasma levels of cholesterol associated with low density lipoproteins are shown to be associated closely with the pre-heparin activities of HL and LPL (38Glaser D.S. Yost T.J. Eckel R.H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 209-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the blood-borne lipase activity may play a role in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Thus, the possibility exists that the in vivo lipolysis function of HL may not require binding to HSPG on cell surfaces. In the current study, we have tested the hypothesis that increases in circulating hHL activity lead to enhanced catabolism of plasma lipoproteins. Expression of the HSPG binding-deficient chimeric hHLmt in mice through adenovirus-mediated gene transfer resulted in elevated pre-heparin lipase activity and severe hypoalphalipoproteinemia in vivo.

Briefly, the respective cDNAs were subcloned into an E1/E3-deleted recombinant adenovirus vector backbone containing the cytomegalovirus promoter to generate pAd.luc, pAd.hHL, and pAd.hHLmt, respectively. The pAd plasmids were transfected into the 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Fungizone, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Positive plaques containing adenoviruses encoding luciferase (Ad.luc), hHL (Ad.hHL), or hHLmt (Ad.hHLmt) were propagated using the 293 cells in confluent 150-mm dishes. The adenoviruses were purified by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. The desalted virus stock was adjusted to 4% sucrose, quantified by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm, and stored at –80 °C prior to use. Animals and Primary Hepatocyte Cultures—Female C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) at 6–8 weeks old were maintained on a normal chow diet and a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Mice were injected with 200 μl of saline or with up to 1.8 × 1010 virus particles (VP) encoding luciferase, hHL, or hHLmt via the tail vein. Blood was collected via the saphenous vein from 7-h fasted mice at various time points. One h later, mice were injected with heparin (500 units/kg) via the tail vein, and post-heparin blood was collected 5 min after heparin administration. Primary hepatocytes were prepared from adenovirus-infected or uninfected mice according to previously described methods (39Subrahmanyan L. Kisilevsky R. Scand. J.

Acta. 1995; 1272: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of 1–2 × 106 cells/well in fibronectin-coated (25 μg/well) 6-well plates with William's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, 250 ng/ml Fungizone, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Six h after plating, cells were washed twice in serum-free William's medium and incubated in Hepatozyme medium for another 4 h. The conditioned media were collected and spun at 2,000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Fumed silica (12.5 mg) was mixed with 1 ml of media by incubation at 4 °C for 16 h with continued rotating. The media were removed after centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and the fumed silica was washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Following washes, a cell lysis/SDS-PAGE loading buffer (200 μl of 10 mm Tris; 8 m urea; 2% SDS; 10% glycerol; 5% β-mercaptoethanol; 0.001% bromphenol blue; pH 8.3) was added, and samples were heated at 75 °C for 20 min to elute bound proteins. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C prior to use. For the cell samples, the cell lysis/SDS-PAGE loading buffer (200 μl) was mixed with the cells, and the mixture was stored at –80 °C prior to use. Ex vivo adenoviral infections of primary hepatocytes were achieved by adding adenovirus at a concentration of 20 VP/cell to the Hepatozyme medium for 24 h. Following infection, cells were washed twice with Hepatozyme medium and incubated in Hepatozyme medium for 4 h. Cells and media were collected and treated for apolipoprotein analysis as described above. Plasma Lipid Analyses—Fresh plasma (3 μl) were separated on 0.6% agarose gels for 30 min at 100 V of direct current in 1% sodium barbital, pH 8.6. Agarose gels were fixed for 30 min (with 54% ethanol; 19% acetic acid in double distilled H2O) and dried for 1 h at 65 °C prior to staining with 7% Sudan black B in methanol. For separation of lipoproteins, pooled plasma (500 μl) from saline, Ad.luc-, Ad.hHL-, or Ad.hHLmt-injected mice were loaded onto two in-series Superose-6 columns that had been equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline and fractionated by FPLC. One-ml fractions were collected, and lipids were measured. Total cholesterol (TC) and phospholipid (PL) from plasma (2 μl/measurement) or FPLC (30 μl/measurement) were measured using commercial kits (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Analyses—Plasma and primary hepatocyte samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (3–15% gel). Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were immunoblotted for different apoproteins. To detect plasma apoB, 2 μl of plasma was used. Plasma was diluted 1:10,000 for detecting apoA-I. Hepatic Lipase Activity Assay—The activity of HL from plasma was assayed using a [3H]triolein emulsion as described previously (41Ehnholm C. Kuusi T.

Expression of hHLmt Increases Pre-heparin HL Activity—We have previously generated a chimeric HL (hHLmt) by exchanging the C-terminal 70 amino acid residues with the corresponding sequence of mHL (Fig. 1A) and shown in vitro that the chimeric hHLmt retained the catalytic properties of hHL but shared the HSPG binding properties of mHL (35Brown R.J.

To determine any functional differences between normal hHL and the HSPG binding-deficient chimeric hHLmt in vivo, we generated adenoviruses encoding hHL and hHLmt and infected them (1.8 × 1010 VP) into female C57BL/6J mice. Plasma HL activities were measured in both pre- and post-heparin plasma 7 days after infection, using [3H]triolein as a substrate (Fig. 1B). The pre-heparin plasma HL activities in hHLmt-expressing mice were 3-fold higher than that in hHL-expressing mice (9.8 ± 1.7 versus 3.1 ± 0.5 μmol FFA/h/ml plasma), indicating a reduced HSPG binding affinity of hHLmt. The pre-heparin plasma HL activity in hHL-expressing mice exhibited a background level similar to that in control mice injected with saline or infected with luciferase (Fig. 1B). The post-heparin plasma HL activities between hHL- and hHLmt-expressing mice were comparable (17.6 ± 6.6 versus 25.4 ± 7.6 μmol FFA/h/ml plasma), suggesting similar amounts of the HL being expressed. Expression of hHLmt Decreases HDL Lipids—Pre-heparin plasma from mice infected for 7 days with adenovirus encoding hHL or hHLmt (up to 1.8 × 1010 VP) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). A marked reduction of lipid staining for α-migrating lipoproteins was observed in mice expressing hHLmt in a dose-dependent manner. At the same doses of infection, mice expressing hHL displayed no changes in lipid staining of lipoproteins. Quantification of total cholesterol and phospholipids in the plasma of mice 7 days after infection (with 1.8 × 1010 VP) showed decreased total cholesterol (hHL, 127 ± 58 mg/dl; hHLmt, 76 ± 30 mg/dl) and phospholipids (hHL, 162 ± 40 mg/dl; hHLmt, 63 ± 43 mg/dl) as a result of the expression of the HSPG binding-deficient hHLmt. Inverse Correlation between Plasma Total Cholesterol and Phospholipid Levels and Pre-heparin HL Activity—The concentrations of total cholesterol and phospholipid were contrasted between hHL- and hHLmt-expressing mice infected with respective viruses for up to 8 days. Both total cholesterol (Fig. 3A) and phospholipid (Fig. 3B) concentrations decreased to minimum at 4 days after infection, whereas the pre-heparin plasma hHLmt activity gradually increased to maximum (Fig. 3C). In contrast, there were no significant changes in plasma total cholesterol, phospholipids, or pre-heparin HL activity in mice expressing the wild-type HL throughout the entire post-infection period examined. The average plasma total cholesterol (74.4 ± 11.6 mg/dl), phospholipid levels (196.9 ± 27.1 mg/dl), and pre-heparin HL activities (3.3 ± 0.9 μmol FFA/h/ml) in hHL-expressing mice during the post-infection period were comparable with control mice injected with saline (TC: 74.3 ± 9.3 mg/dl; PL: 199.2 ± 20.3 mg/dl; HL activity: 5.0 ± 1.2 μmol of FFA/h/ml) or mice infected with luciferase (TC: 70.6 ± 9.7 mg/dl; PL: 182.2 ± 35.9 mg/dl; HL activity: 4.2 ± 1.0 μmol of FFA/h/ml). Fractionation of lipoproteins in the fasted pre-heparin plasma by FPLC showed that the loss of total cholesterol and phospholipid was mainly attributable to decreased HDL. Data presented in Fig. 4 show lipid profiles of plasma samples pooled from three mice 7 days after infection with 1.8 × 1010 VP. The most prominent peak of total cholesterol in the plasma of hHL-expressing mice was for HDL (7.4 mg/dl), which was 5-fold lower (1.4 mg/dl) in the plasma of hHLmt-expressing mice (Fig. 4A). Likewise, the most prominent peak of phospholipid in the plasma of hHL-expressing mice was for HDL (12.0 mg/dl), and the level of HDL phospholipid in hHLmt-expressing mice was 5-fold lower (2.3 mg/dl) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest strongly that expression of the HSPG binding-deficient hHLmt has profoundly decreased plasma concentrations of HDL lipids. Expression of hHLmt Decreases Hepatic ApoA-I Secretion—We next determined whether the loss of HDL lipids is associated with changes in apoA-I, the major apolipoprotein constituent of HDL. Immunoblot analysis of pre-heparin plasma, obtained from mice infected with virus (1.8 × 1010 VP) encoding hHL or hHLmt, showed markedly diminished apoA-I in hHLmt-expressing mouse plasma 2 days after infection (Fig. 5A). There was no change in plasma apoA-I in mice infected with hHL or luciferase and in mice injected with saline. Semiquantitative analysis by scanning densitometry of the immunoblots showed comparable levels of apoA-I between hHL-expressing mice, luciferase-expressing mice, and saline-injected mice throughout the post-infection period (Fig. 5B). Because the majority of the plasma apoA-I originates from the liver, we examined the effect of HL expression on the hepatic apoA-I levels in the infected mice. Immunoblot analysis of apoA-I present in total liver homogenates of three mice infected with 1.8 × 1010 VP revealed marked reduction of hepatic apoA-I in mice expressing hHLmt as compared with those expressing hHL (Fig. 6A). Scanning densitometry analysis of the hepatic apoA-I immunoblots showed a 10-fold decrease in mice expressing hHLmt (Fig. 6B). Thus, expression of HSPG binding-deficient hHLmt results in decreased apoA-I in the liver, which may underlie the reduced plasma apoA-I concentrations. To ascertain that hHLmt expression indeed results in attenuated hepatic apoA-I expression and secretion, we prepared primary hepatocytes from mice that had been infected with virus encoding hHLmt or luciferase for 10 days. Cell-associated apoA-I and accumulation of apoA-I in the conditioned medium of cells cultured with a serum-free medium for 4 h was determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 7A, apoA-I levels in medium from hHLmt-infected hepatocytes were reduced by 3-fold (determined by scanning densitometry) as compared with medium from luciferase control hepatocytes. The decrease was specific to apoA-I as no appreciable changes were observed for apoE or apoB48. (The level of apoB100 was below detection.) The level of cell-associated apoA-I in hHLmt-expressing hepatocytes was reduced by 2-fold (determined by scanning densitometry) as compared with that in luciferase control cells (Fig. 7B). The hepatic apoE or apoB48 concentrations were not changed between hHLmt-expressing and luciferase control cells. Reduced hepatic secretion of apoA-I was also observed with primary hepatocytes isolated from normal mice that were infected with virus encoding hHLmt ex vivo. One day after infection, the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 4 h, and the accumulation of apoA-I at the end of incubation was determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 8A, accumulation of apoA-I in the conditioned medium of cells infected with hHLmt virus was decreased as compared with cells infected with either hHL or luciferase. There was no difference in accumulation of apoB48 in the medium between hHLmt-expressing cells and hHL- or luciferase-expressing cells. Unlike the primary hepatocytes isolated from mice infected with hHLmt in which hepatic apoA-I was reduced (Fig. 7B), the cell-associated apoA-I in cells transiently infected with hHLmt ex vivo did not show alterations as compared with cells infected with luciferase control (Fig. 8B). The in vivo and ex vivo data together suggest that the impaired hepatic apoA-I production may underlie the hypoalphalipoproteinemia effect of expression of the HSPG binding-defective hHLmt. The present work attempts to examine the physiological significance of the cell surface anchorage of hHL in vivo. We have disrupted normal HSPG binding of hHL using recombinant DNA techniques and determined the effect of expression of the HSPG binding-deficient hHL (hHLmt) on lipoprotein metabolism in mice. The advantage of this animal model is that elevation of circulating HL levels in vivo is achieved without heparin administration that indiscriminately removes all HSPG-binding proteins from the endothelium surface. Our data have shown that the expression of the heparin binding-deficient hHLmt results in a severe hypoalphalipoproteinemia phenotype in mice, as exemplified by markedly decreased HDL lipids and HDL proteins. These lipid and lipoprotein lowering effects of the HSPG binding-deficient hHLmt appear to be specific to HDL as apoB-containing lipoprotein levels were unaffected. The HDL lowering effect of hHLmt in mice is unlikely to be the artifact of an overly high level expression of the recombinant enzyme proteins because expression of the wild-type hHL at similar levels exerts no effect. Thus, the current studies have revealed an important functional significance for HSPG binding of hHL in the metabolism of lipoproteins, mainly HDL, that originate from the liver. In humans, high plasma HL activity (measured using post-heparin samples) is associated with reduced HDL cholesterol and small HDL particles (42Blades B. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Arterioscler.
