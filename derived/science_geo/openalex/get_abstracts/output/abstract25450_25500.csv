https://openalex.org/W2100475900,"CpG islands are normally methylation free in cells of the animal, even when the associated gene is transcriptionally silent. In mouse NIH 3T3 and L cells, however, over half of the islands are heavily methylated. Near identity of the methylated subset in the two cell lines suggested that methylation is confined to genes that are nonessential in culture. In agreement with this, islands at several tissue-specific genes, but not at housekeeping genes, have become methylated in many human and mouse cell lines. At the chromatin level, methylated islands are Mspl resistant compared with their nonmethylated counterparts. We suggest that mutation-like gene inactivation due to CpG island methylation is widespread in many cell lines and could explain the loss of cell type-specific functions in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2008661167,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from mouse fetal liver, like adult HSCs, are Thy-1lo Lin- Sca-1+. Donor-derived V gamma 3+ T cells were detected in fetal thymic lobes repopulated in vitro with fetal liver HSCs, but not in those with adult bone marrow HSCs. Single clonogenic fetal HSCs gave rise to thymic progeny that include V gamma 3+, other gamma delta+, and alpha beta+ T cells. No V gamma 3+ T cells were detected in adult thymus injected intrathymically with either fetal or adult HSCs. These results support the hypothesis that only fetal HSCs have the capacity to differentiate into V gamma 3+ T cells in the fetal thymic microenvironment and that the developmental potential of HSCs may change during ontogeny."

https://openalex.org/W1963804483,"We have used cross-linking reagents on cell lines expressing both p185neu and EGFR. The lysates of the cells were precipitated with anti-p185neu or anti-EGFR antibodies. These precipitates included a high molecular weight complex that was identified as an EGFR-p185neu heterodimer. Heterodimerization was found to be induced by exposure to EGR. The EGFR of these cells displayed three affinity states for EGF: low (Kd, approximately 10(-9) M), high (Kd, 10(-9) to 10(-10) M), and very high (Kd, 10(-11) M), as determined by Scatchard analyses. Relatively small levels of EGF had a dramatic biological effect on cells expressing very high affinity EGFR. The very high affinity EGFR disappeared after the cells were treated with anti-p185neu monoclonal antibodies that selectively down-regulated p185neu. EGF and TPA had differential effects on down-modulation of the EGFR in cells that express either one or both species of receptor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089545402,"We report an induction process occurring between two germ layers in the Drosophila embryo that involves a cascade of five interacting genes. Two of these, Ultrabithorax and abdominal-A, encode nuclear homeobox proteins; each of them is expressed in one of two adjacent parasegments in the visceral mesoderm and directs expression in its parasegment of a separate target gene, decapentaplegic in parasegment 7 and windless in parasegment 8. The activity of both target genes is required for normal expression of another homeotic gene, labial, in cells of the adhering midgut epithelium. Their products are putative extracellular proteins, which presumably act as signals between the two germ layers. Positional instruction of this kind may be needed since the endoderm, unlike the mesoderm, appears unsegmented at first as it originates from two primordia near the embryonic poles, outside the realm of segmentation genes."
https://openalex.org/W1585218706,"The metabolism of [1,2-13C2]acetate in rat brain was studied by in vivo and in vitro 13C NMR spectroscopy, in particular by taking advantage of the homonuclear 13C-13C spin coupling patterns. Well nourished rats were infused with [1,2-13C2]acetate or [1-13C]acetate in the jugular vein, and the in situ kinetics of 13C labeling during the infusion period was followed by 13C NMR techniques. The in vivo 13C NMR spectra showed signals from (i) the C-1 carbon of [1,2-13C2] acetate or [1-13C]acetate, (ii) 13CO3H-, and (iii) the natural abundance 13C carbons of sufficiently mobile fatty acids. Methanol/HCl/perchloric acid extracts of the brains were prepared and were further analyzed by high resolution 13C NMR. The homonuclear 13C-13C spin coupling patterns after infusion of [1,2-13C2]acetate showed very different isotopomer populations in glutamate, glutamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Analyzing the relative proportions of these isotopomers revealed (i) two different glutamate compartments in the rat brain characterized by the presence and absence, respectively, of glutamine synthase activity, (ii) two different tricarboxylic acid cycles, one preferentially metabolizing [(1,2-13C2]acetate, the other mainly using unlabeled acetyl-coenzyme A, (iii) a hitherto unknown cerebral pyruvate recycling system associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle, metabolizing primarily unlabeled acetyl-coenzyme A, and (iv) a predominant production of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the glutamate compartment lacking glutamine synthase."

https://openalex.org/W2006591452,"POU proteins have been shown to transcriptionally active cell-specific genes and to participate in the determination of cell fate. It is therefore thought that these proteins function in development through the stable activation of genes that define specific developmental pathways. Evidence is provided here for an alternative mode of action. The primary structure of SCIP, a POU protein expressed by developing Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, was deduced and SCIP activity was studied. Both in normal development and in response to nerve transection, SCIP expression was transiently activated only during the period of rapid cell division that separates the premyelinating and myelinating phases of Schwann cell differentiation. In cotransfection assays, SCIP acted as a transcriptional repressor of myelin-specific genes."

https://openalex.org/W1505755593,"The site specificity of tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation in intact PC12 cells, labeled with 32Pi, was investigated. Digestion of 32P-tyrosine hydroxylase with trypsin produced five distinct 32P-labeled peptides (termed PC-1 through PC-5). Sequencing of the peptides revealed four acceptor sites: Ser8, Ser19, Ser31, and Ser40. The phosphorylation site in peptides PC-1 (AV-SEQDAK) and PC-2 (RAVSEQDAK) was identified as Ser19. Agents which cause calcium influx increased 32P incorporation into tyrosine hydroxylase at Ser19. PC-3 was identified as QAEAVTSPR, which contains the phosphorylation site Ser31. Nerve growth factor and phorbol dibutyrate increased 32P incorporation into Ser31. PC-4 was identified as the N-terminal amino acid sequence ((M)PTPSAPSPQPK), and the 32P incorporation occurred at Ser8. Of the agents tested, only okadaic acid (a protein phosphatase inhibitor) increased the phosphorylation of Ser8. PC-5 was shown to contain Ser40. Treatment of the PC12 cells with cAMP-acting agents increased 32P incorporation into Ser40. The present results demonstrate that some, but not all, of the phosphorylation sites demonstrated previously in vitro exist in situ. Conversely, the identification of Ser31 establishes a physiological phosphorylation site not previously reported in vitro. These four sites account for most, if not all, of the diversity in tryptic phosphopeptides reported previously for rat tyrosine hydroxylase."

https://openalex.org/W1565471250,"We have developed a quantitative method to evaluate the interaction between cell surface receptors and the endocytic apparatus. This method exploits occupancy-dependent changes in internalization rates that occur in cells expressing high numbers of receptors. We found that constitutive internalization of the transferrin receptor behaves as a simple, first order process that is unaltered by ligand. Internalization of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, however, behaves as a saturable, second order process that is induced by receptor occupancy. Internalization of EGF receptors occurs through at least two distinct pathways: a low capacity pathway that has a relatively high affinity for occupied receptors, and a low affinity pathway that has a much higher capacity. The high affinity pathway was observed in all cells having receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Mutant EGF receptors lacking kinase activity could not utilize the high affinity pathway and were internalized only through the low affinity one. Mutated receptors with decreased affinity for kinase substrates were also internalized at decreased rates through the high affinity, inducible pathway. In the case of vitellogenin receptors in Xenopus oocytes, occupied receptors competed more efficiently for internalization than empty ones. Insulin increased the endocytic capacity of oocytes for vitellogenin receptors. Similarly, serum increased the capacity of the inducible pathway for EGF receptors in mammalian cells. These data are consistent with a model of internalization in which occupied receptors bind to specific cellular components that mediate rapid internalization. Ligand-induced internalization results from an increase in the affinity of occupied receptors for the endocytic apparatus. Hormones can also indirectly regulate endocytosis by increasing the number of coated pits or their rate of internalization. The ability to dissect receptor-specific effects from cell-specific ones should be very useful in investigating the molecular mechanisms of receptor mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1578523883,"Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), a leukocyte-restricted integrin receptor, mediates neutrophil/monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium and phagocytosis of complement-opsonized particles. Recent studies have shown that Mac-1 also functions as a receptor for fibrinogen in a reaction linked to fibrin deposition on the monocyte surface. In this study, we have used extended proteolytic digestion of fibrinogen to identify the region of this molecule that interacts with Mac-1. We found that an Mr approximately 30,000 plasmic fragment D of fibrinogen (D30) produced dose-dependent inhibition (IC50 = 1.6 microM) of the interaction of intact 125I-fibrinogen with stimulated neutrophils and monocytes. 125I-D30 bound saturably to these cells with specific association of 136,200 +/- 15,000 molecules/cell in a reaction inhibited by OKM1 and M1/70, monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha subunit of Mac-1. Direct microsequence analysis and an epitope-mapped monoclonal antibody showed that D30 lacks the COOH-terminal dodecapeptide of the gamma chain as well as the Arg-Gly-Asp sequences in the A alpha chain. We conclude that fibrinogen interacts with the leukocyte integrin Mac-1 through a novel recognition site that is not shared with other known integrins that function as fibrinogen receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1508412813,"The mechanism of reversal of resistance to Vinca alkaloids by cyclosporins is unclear. We investigated the molecular mechanism of reversal of Vinca alkaloid resistance by cyclosporin A (CsA) and its nonimmunosuppressive analog O-acetyl C9(1) CsA (SDZ 33-243) in multidrug resistant DC-3F/VCRd-5L Chinese hamster cells. CsA at 3 microM increased vincristine (VCR) sensitivity and almost totally reversed VCR resistance. SDZ 33-243 at 1 microM reduced the IC50 for VCR in resistant cells from 62.0 to 0.00062 microM. CsA and SDZ 33-243 at 10 microM increased [3H]vinblastine (VBL) accumulation in DC-3F/VCRd-5L cells by 27- and 22-fold, respectively. At 10 microM, these compounds also increased [3H]VCR accumulation by 3.5- and 4.0-fold, respectively. [3H]VCR uptake by membrane vesicles from DC-3F/VCRd-5L cells showed high and low affinity components with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and apparent Km values were 0.140 +/- 0.0523 and 24.8 +/- 6.67 microM, respectively. Kinetic analysis of [3H]VCR uptake in membrane vesicles in the presence of 0.2 microM CsA revealed that CsA competitively inhibited the high affinity [3H]VCR uptake with an apparent inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.126 +/- 0.0173 microM. In addition, CsA and SDZ 33-243 inhibited VBL photoaffinity labeling of P-glycoprotein in a dose-dependent manner, with half-maximum inhibition at 0.5 and 0.4 microM, respectively, compared with that of VBL at 0.6 microM. These data confirm that cyclosporins modulate Vinca alkaloid resistance at least partially through interaction with P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1510010134,"The potent diuretic and natriuretic peptide hormone atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), with vasodilatory activity also stimulates steroidogenic responsiveness in Leydig cells. The actions of ANF are mediated by its interaction with specific cell surface receptors and the membrane-bound form of guanylate cyclase represents an atrial natriuretic factor receptor (ANF-R). To understand the mechanism of ANF action in testicular steroidogenesis and to identify guanylate cyclase/ANF-R that is expressed in the Leydig cells, the primary structure of murine guanylate cyclase/ANF-R has been deduced from its cDNA sequence. A cDNA library constructed from poly(A+) RNA of murine Leydig tumor (MA-10) cell line was screened for the membrane-bound form of ANF-R/guanylate cyclase sequences by hybridization with a rat brain guanylate cyclase/ANF-R cDNA probe. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA shows that murine guanylate cyclase/ANF-R cDNA consists of 1057 amino acids with 21 amino acids comprising the transmembrane domain which separates an extracellular ligand-binding domain (469 amino acid residues) and an intracellular guanylate cyclase domain (567 amino acid residues). Upon transfection of the murine guanylate cyclase/ANF-R cDNA in COS-7 cells, the expressed protein showed specific binding to 125I-ANF, stimulation of guanylate cyclase activity and production of intracellular cGMP in response to ANF. The expression of guanylate cyclase/ANF-R cDNA transfected in rat Leydig tumor cells stimulated the production of testosterone and intracellular cGMP after treatment with ANF. The results presented herein directly show that ANF can regulate the testicular steroidogenic responsiveness in addition to its known regulatory role in the control of cardiovascular homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W1554294376,"We have studied the interaction of the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor with a glucocorticoid response element from the tyrosine aminotransferase gene. This response element consists of two binding sites (half-sites) for the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain. The sequences of these two half-sites are not identical, and we have previously shown that binding occurs preferentially to one of the half-sites (Tsai, S.-Y., Carlstedt-Duke, J., Weigel, N. L., Dahlman, K., Gustafsson, J.-A., Tsai, M.-J., and O'Malley, B. W. (1988) Cell 55, 361-369). We show here that binding to the low affinity half-site is dependent on previous occupancy of the high affinity half-site. This facilitated binding is dependent on the distance between the two half-sites and their relative orientation but is not dependent on the integrity of the DNA backbone. This is consistent with a model where DNA binding is not only dependent on interactions between the protein and its DNA target sequence but is also influenced by interactions between the protein molecules bound."
https://openalex.org/W2040326609,"Antigen-specific tolerance of T cells to minor lymphocyte stimulatory (Mls) antigens can be induced in mice by neonatal injection of foreign lymphohematopoietic cells. Although immune responses to Mlsa antigens are controlled by B cells, CD8+ T cells were the most effective cell type for induction of Mlsa tolerance. Tolerance was evident in both thymus and lymph nodes and could be induced by as few as 2 x 10(4) CD8+ T cells; these cells were 50 to 100 times as potent as CD4+ cells or B cells in causing functional tolerance and deletion of V beta 6+ T cells. Thus, intrathymic contact with antigens expressed on CD8+ T cells may play an important role in controlling the normal development of tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1515946344,"Coated pits will assemble onto purified plasma membranes that are attached to a poly-L-lysine coated substratum (Moore, M. S., Mahaffey, D. T., Brodsky, F. M., and Anderson, R. G. W. (1987) Science 236, 558-563; Mahaffey, D. T., Moore, M. S., Brodsky, F. M., and Anderson, R. G. W. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 1615-1624). To better understand the assembly reaction, we have purified both clathrin triskelion and AP-2 subunits from bovine brain and assayed for their ability to bind to the cytoplasmic surface of attached membranes. Two types of membranes were analyzed: those washed with a high pH buffer that selectively removes triskelions and those washed with a high salt buffer that removes both the AP-2 and the triskelion subunits. We found that purified AP-2 subunits bind with high affinity (Kd approximately 3 x 10(-8) M) to salt stripped membranes. Binding is saturable and abolished by treating membranes with less than 20 micrograms/ml of elastase. When membranes were treated with elastase before the salt wash and then salt washed and assayed for AP-2 binding, normal binding was seen, which indicates that the presence of clathrin-coated pits protects the binding site from the protease. Membranes that had rebound AP-2 did not bind purified triskelions, even though high pH buffer-washed membranes that bear endogenous AP-2 bound triskelions with high affinity (Kd approximately 3 x 10(-9) M) and supported lattice assembly. We conclude that coated pit assembly is initiated by the binding of AP-2 to an integral membrane protein but that the AP-2 complex must be activated by an unknown process before the coated pit lattice will assemble."
https://openalex.org/W1517671850,"The regulation by dexamethasone of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor expression during the adipose differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells was investigated at the receptor protein and mRNA level. Preadipocytes were poorly responsive to beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) agonists and expressed few beta-ARs (approximately 3,000 sites/cell) solely of beta 1 subtype. Differentiation increased adrenergic sensitivity and total beta-AR number (approximately 16,000 sites/cell) with a beta 1/beta 2 ratio of approximately 90/10. Long term exposure of either differentiating cells or mature adipocytes to dexamethasone induced down-regulation of (-)-isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity which paralleled a 2- to 3.5-fold decrease in beta-ARs, while the beta 1/beta 2 ratio switched to approximately 20/80. The ratios of beta 1/beta 2 binding sites were always consistent with the rank order of potency of beta-adrenergic agonists in stimulating the adenylate cyclase system. The action of steroid agonists and antagonist suggested a glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mechanism. The beta 1-AR mRNA (3.2 kilobases) was stimulated 3-4.7 times in differentiated cells, as compared with preadipose cells; this beta 1-AR transcript was repressed in dexamethasone-treated cells. The beta 2-AR mRNA species (2.3 kilobases), absent in preadipocytes, was expressed at low levels in untreated adipocytes, but reached 11-fold this level in dexamethasone-exposed cells. The switch in receptor subtype protein and mRNA levels elicited by dexamethasone demonstrates the differential genetic control by glucocorticoids of beta-AR subtype expression in 3T3-F442A cells. We suggest that this regulation of beta-AR gene expression requires interactions of glucocorticoid receptors with specific DNA targets and with one (or several) transcription factor(s) that are cell- and differentiation state-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2008349061,"The sodium- and potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K(+)-ATPase) maintains the transmembrane Na+ gradient to which is coupled all active cellular transport systems. The R and S alleles of the gene encoding the Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha 1 subunit isoform were identified in Dahl salt-resistant (DR) and Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats, respectively. Characterization of the S allele-specific Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha 1 complementary DNA identified a leucine substitution of glutamine at position 276. This mutation alters the hydropathy profile of a region in proximity to T3(Na), the trypsin-sensitive site that is only detected in the presence of Na+. This mutation causes a decrease in the rubidium-86 influx of S allele-specific sodium pumps, thus marking a domain in the Na+,K(+)-ATPase alpha subunit important for K+ transport, and supporting the hypothesis of a putative role of these pumps in hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1863123985,"We have shown previously that treatment of the coated vesicle proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)-ATPase) with chaotropic agents results in the release of a set of peripheral polypeptides which includes the 73-, 58-, 40-, 34-, and 33-kDa subunits (Adachi, I., Puopolo, K., Marquez-Sterling, N., Arai, H., and Forgac, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 967-973), with a coordinate loss of H(+)-ATPase activity. In the present paper we report the functional reassembly of the coated vesicle proton pump following dissociation of the peripheral subunits. Reassembly was demonstrated by restoration of ATP-driven proton transport using both native membranes and reconstituted vesicles and by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody specific for the 73-kDa subunit. Reassembly occurs by attachment of a peripheral subcomplex containing the 73-, 58-, 34-, and 33-kDa subunits together with the 40-kDa polypeptide. The reassembled H(+)-ATPase, like the native proton pump, is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. Reassociation shows a biphasic time dependence, with restoration of 50-60% of the starting proton transport activity in the 1st h followed by recovery of a further 20-30% of the activity after 24 h. Reassembly also shows a marked dependence on protein concentration but, unlike solubilization of the intact H(+)-ATPase complex, does not require the presence of glycerol. Despite the ability of nucleotides to promote dissociation of the peripheral complex by chaotropic agents, reassociation is not blocked by the presence of 1 mM ATP. These results thus provide the first evidence for functional reassembly of a vacuolar H(+)-ATPase complex and should be useful in further analysis of the role of individual subunits in the assembly and activity of these ATP-driven proton pumps."

https://openalex.org/W1603537849,"A polypeptide containing the catalytic domain of an atrial natriuretic peptide receptor guanylate cyclase has been produced using a bacterial expression system. A carboxyl fragment of the membrane form of guanylate cyclase from rat brain, which contains a region homologous to soluble guanylate and adenylate cyclases, was expressed in Escherichia coli with a double plasmid system that encodes T7 RNA polymerase (Tabor, S., and Richardson, C.C. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 1074-1078). Application of this expression system permitted exclusive radiolabeling of the cloned gene product, thereby providing a means to evaluate the level of expression and stability of encoded proteins. Fusion proteins were formed with the T7 bacteriophage gene 10 product and the 293 carboxyl-terminal residues of guanylate cyclase and two deletional mutants encoding 105 and 69 residues. Extracts prepared from bacteria expressing the carboxyl region, but not those expressing further deletions in this region, had substantial guanylate cyclase activity. There was no associated adenylate cyclase activity, suggesting that the catalytic domain retained its enzymatic specificity. These results provide direct evidence that the carboxyl portion of the membrane form of guanylate cyclase contains a catalytic domain. Homologous regions of the soluble form of guanylate cyclase and adenylate cyclase are likely to have enzymatic properties."
https://openalex.org/W1520149600,"The exon-intron structure of the human laminin B1 chain gene was determined from genomic clones that spanned 90 kilobase pairs (kb), including 80 kb of the structural gene, about 1 kb of the 5'-flanking region, and 9 kb of the 3'-flanking region. DNA sequencing and heteroduplex analyses demonstrated that the gene consists of 34 exons. The intron sizes vary from 92 base pairs to more than 15,000 base pairs. The clones did not completely contain introns 13 and 14 and, therefore, the exact size of the gene remains to be determined. The first exon encodes a 5'-untranslated region, with the ATG translation start codon being in exon 2. The promoter region does not contain TATA or CAAT boxes, but it has four GC boxes. Additionally, two GC boxes are located in the 5'-untranslated sequence. A glucocorticoid response element-like sequence and a sequence resembling the binding sequence for transcription factor AP-2 are present in the 5'-flanking region. Another potential AP-2 binding sequence is located in the 5'-untranslated sequence of exon 1. A TGACC motif present in the binding region for the retinoic acid response element of the mouse laminin B1 gene promoter is also present in the human counterpart. The overall exon pattern of the gene correlates only slightly with the highly conserved structural domains and internal repeats of the B1 polypeptide chain. Furthermore, the exon profile differs considerably from that of the laminin B2 gene. A HincII/HpaI restriction fragment length polymorphism was identified in exon 31."
https://openalex.org/W1505708906,"We have analyzed the surface polarity of both the cation-independent (CI-MPR) and the cation-dependent (CD-MPR) mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line grown on polycarbonate filters. The surface localization was studied by plasma membrane domain-specific surface labeling methods and by confocal microscopy using MPR-specific antibodies. The CI-MPR was shown to be exclusively present on the basolateral cell surface. In contrast, the CD-MPR was expressed neither apically nor basolaterally. However, an intracellular pool of CD-MPR could be detected. In MDCKII-RCAr cells, cell surface CI-MPR was shown to recycle between the basolateral plasma membrane and the trans-Golgi network. After exogalactosylation, cell surface CI-MPR acquired sialic acid residues in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the basolateral CI-MPR was shown to be functional. Lysosomal enzymes, bearing the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker, were taken up from the basolateral medium and endocytosed into the cells. Uptake of lysosomal enzymes from the apical side was insignificant and not MPR mediated. These results extend previous immunoelectron microscopic studies on the intracellular polarity of the CI-MPR (Parton, R. G., Prydz, K., Bomsel, M., Simons, K., and Griffiths, G. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 109, 3259-3272) which showed that the CI-MPR was present in basolateral early endosomes and in late endosomes but absent from apical early endosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1483356362,"Abstract We have purified a DNA helicase from calf thymus to apparent homogeneity by monitoring the activity with a strand displacement assay. DNA helicase followed the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex through chromatography on phosphocellulose and hydroxylapatite. Separation from DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex as well as from the bulk of another DNA-dependent ATPase was achieved on heparin-Sepharose. Further purification steps included ATP-agarose and fast protein liquid chromatography-Mono S. A 47-kDa polypeptide cosedimented with the DNA helicase activity in a glycerol gradient as well as in gel filtration on Superose 6. The calf thymus DNA helicase had a sedimentation coefficient of 4-7 S and Stokes radius of about 45 A suggesting that the enzyme might be monomer in its functional form. DNA helicase activity requires a divalent cation with Mg2+ being more efficient than Mn2+ or Ca2+. Hydrolysis of ATP is required since the two nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and adenylyl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate cannot substitute for ATP or dATP in the displacement reaction. Calf thymus DNA helicase is able to use ATP, dATP, dideoxy-ATP, CTP, and dCTP with Km for ATP and dATP of 0.2 and 0.25 mM, respectively. The enzyme can displace a fragment of 24 bases completely in an enzyme concentration- and time-dependent manner. The DNA helicase appears to bind to single-stranded DNA and to move to single-strand double-strand transition. The directionality of unwinding is 3'----5' with respect to the single-stranded DNA to which the enzyme is bound."
https://openalex.org/W1598342103,"Glutamine synthetase from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum is the target of both ATP- and NAD-dependent modification. Incubation of R. rubrum cell supernatant with [alpha-32P]NAD results in the labeling of glutamine synthetase and two other unidentified proteins. Dinitrogenase reductase ADP-ribosyltransferase does not appear to be responsible for the modification of glutamine synthetase or the unidentified proteins. The [alpha-32P]ATP- and [alpha-32P] NAD-dependent modifications of R. rubrum glutamine synthetase appear to be exclusive and the two forms of modified glutamine synthetase are separable on two-dimensional gels. Loss of enzymatic activity by glutamine synthetase did not correlate with [alpha-32P]NAD labeling. This is in contrast to inactivation by nonphysiological ADP-ribosylation of other glutamine synthetases by an NAD:arginine ADP-ribosyltransferase from turkey erythrocytes (Moss, J., Watkins, P.A., Stanley, S.J., Purnell, M.R., and Kidwell, W.R.

A 32P-labeled protein spot comigrates with the NAD-treated glutamine synthetase spot when glutamine synthetase purified from H3 32PO4-grown cells is analyzed on two-dimensional gels. The adenylylation site of R. rubrum glutamine synthetase has been determined to be Leu-(Asp)-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Met; the tyrosine residue is the site of modification."

The gene contains 8 exons and spans approximately 12 kilobases. Ras-transformed rat liver epithelial cells and rat kidney express RNAs which differ in length by approximately 0.3 kilobase pair. Comparison of the genomic sequence with kidney gamma GT cDNA sequence indicates that the first exon is noncoding, and nuclease protection and primer extension data have identified a potential kidney transcription start site (defined as +1) for this exon. The site is not associated with a TATA box, but there are two CCAAT boxes (-136 and -599) and two sites (-101 and -746) containing the consensus sequences to which the transcription factor SP1 is known to bind. There is also a sequence at -453 (TGTGGTTG) that is highly homologous to the core sequence (TGTGG(T)3-5G) of SV40 and polyoma viral enhancers."
https://openalex.org/W1565138317,"Abstract The glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (PI) membrane anchors of several proteins contain 1-alkyl-2-acyl-glycerophosphoinositol. Although this PI analog has never been found free in cells, the presence of as a component of some membrane anchors suggests its existence. The resistance of ether linkages to cleavage by mild alkali treatment was used to detect possible alkyl chains in the [3H]inositol-labeled phospholipids of several murine lymphoma cell lines which normally express the glycosyl PI-anchored protein Thy-1. One lipid, which arose from alkaline hydrolysis of PI and had mobility on thin layer chromatography similar to lyso-PI, was detected in all wild-type cell lines. Analysis of the base-stable inositol lipids of several lymphoma lines that are deficient in Thy-1 surface expression because of defective biosynthesis of the glycosyl PI membrane anchor revealed that the putative alkyl-PI was missing in the class F mutant. The levels of both the ethanolamine- and choline-containing plasmalogens were also decreased 10-fold in these cells, suggesting a general defect in the production of ether lipids. The activity of the peroxisomal form of dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase, which catalyzes the first step of ether lipid biosynthesis, was found to be 10-fold decreased relative to the wild-type level. Unlike previously described Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants deficient in ether lipids (Zoeller, R. A., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 5170-5174), the class F Thy-1- cells contain intact functional peroxisomes. Attempts to restore the putative alkyl-PI to the class F mutants by alkylglycerol supplementation were unsuccessful, despite concomitant restoration of the much larger plasmenylethanolamine pool, suggesting that there are some differences in the biosynthesis of this PI analog and plasmalogens that are presently not understood. Although the deficiencies in ether lipids and surface expression of Thy-1 in the class F mutants could also be due to separate mutations, our findings raise the possibility that alkyl-PI exists in animal cells and may be an obligate precursor for the biosynthesis of the glycosyl-PI membrane anchor of Thy-1."
https://openalex.org/W2408362060,"Nucleoside permeation across mammalian cell membranes is complex with at least four distinct transporters known. Two of these (es and ei) are equilibrative (facilitated diffusion) carriers that have been studied is considerable detail. The other two (cif and cit) are concentrative, Na(+)-dependent carriers. A major obstacle to the characterization of the latter two mechanisms has been the lack of suitable model systems expressing only a single nucleoside transport activity. The present study describes the isolation of a cell line that has cif as its sole nucleoside transporter. L1210/MC5-1 cells, which have es and cif transport activity, were mutagenized and plated in soft agar containing two cytotoxic nucleosides (tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) and cytosine arabinoside) that are substrates for es but not cif. A clonal line (L1210/MA-27.1) was isolated which retained the capacity for Na(+)-dependent [3H]formycin B transport but was unable to transport [3H]thymidine, a substrate for es but not cif. Failure of the mutant to transport thymidine was also demonstrated by the inability of thymidine (with adenine as a purine source) to rescue these cells from methotrexate toxicity. Furthermore, the mutant lacked nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) binding activity (an integral part of the es transporter) as demonstrated by reversible NBMPR binding and photoaffinity labeling with [3H]NBMPR. Loss of es transport activity was also demonstrated by the failure of NBMPR to affect the toxicity of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (IC50 approximately 30 nM) in L1210/MA27.1 cells. In contrast, NBMPR decreased the IC50 for 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine from 100 to 30 nM in the parental L1210/MC5-1 cell line. These results are consistent with the mechanism of NBMPR potentiation of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine toxicity in L1210 cells being a blockade of efflux via es while the nucleoside is pumped into the cells by the concentrative cif carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1484473034,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biogenesis of long chain fatty acids. The phosphorylation of the Ser-1200 residue by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase transforms ACC from a citrate-independent form to a citrate-dependent form (10, 16). We have isolated ACC cDNA clones with and without 24 bases which code for 8 additional amino acids located 4 residues upstream to the Ser-1200. The presence of the 8 extra amino acids inhibits the in vitro phosphorylation of the Ser-1200 by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The S1 nuclease protection experiments indicate that the corresponding two ACC mRNA species occur in vivo. Furthermore, the occurrence of the two forms of ACC mRNA is regulated under different physiological conditions for lipogenesis in a tissue-specific manner. The existence of two forms of ACC mRNA provides the basis for the existence of isozymes of ACC whose Ser-1200 can be selectively phosphorylated. The location of this regulatory sequence for a specific phosphorylation site represents a new regulatory mechanism for protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1500363713,"Aspartic acid 244 that occurs at the putative NAD(+)-binding site of rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteinase was replaced by glutamic acid by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme was purified to homogeneity as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel permeation chromatography showed that the purified mutant enzyme was a tetramer as is the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, which possesses 1 mol of tightly bound NAD+ per mol of enzyme subunit, the mutant enzyme had only 0.05 mol of NAD+ but contained about 0.6 mol each of NADH and adenine per mol of subunit. The mutant enzyme, after removal of the bound compounds by acid-ammonium sulfate treatment, exhibited S-adenosylhomocysteinase activity when assayed in the presence of NAD+. From the appearance of activity as a function of NAD+ concentration, the enzyme was shown to bind NAD+ with a Kd of 23.0 microM at 25 degrees C, a value greater than 280-fold greater than that of the wild-type enzyme. In the presence of a saturating concentration of NAD+, the mutant enzyme showed apparent Km values for substrates similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. Moderate decreases of 8- and 15-fold were observed in Vmax values for the synthetic and hydrolytic directions, respectively. These results indicate the importance of Asp-244 in binding NAD+, and are consistent with the idea that the region of S-adenosylhomocysteinase from residues 213 to 244 is part of the NAD+ binding site. This region has structural features characteristic of the dinucleotide-binding domains of NAD(+)- and FAD-binding proteins (Ogawa, H., Gomi, T., Mueckler, M. M., Fujioka, M., Backlund, P.S., Jr., Aksamit, R.R., Unson, C.G., and Cantoni, G.L. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 719-723)."
https://openalex.org/W1495790002,"This report correlates constitutive and glucocorticoid-mediated alterations in glutamine synthetase gene expression observed in chicken retinal organ cultures with activation of the gene during terminal differentiation. Because glucocorticoid hormones are potent inducers of glutamine synthetase in embryonic retinae, they have been considered as primary mediators of the developmental rise. However, unlike what might be expected of a developmental inducer, our data demonstrate that glucocorticoids act as reversible regulators of glutamine synthetase transcription. Moreover, long-term organ culture of embryonic retina in the absence of glucocorticoids leads to a dramatic increase in expression of glutamine synthetase mRNA. These studies argue that although glucocorticoids may potentiate transcription of glutamine synthetase, the retina has been programmed as early as embryonic day 6 to express this enzyme at a later time via a glucocorticoid-independent process. Interestingly, transcription of retinal glutamine synthetase increases by only approximately 10-fold during development, based on nuclear run-on measurements. Therefore, post-transcriptional control mechanisms might also contribute to the 130-fold increase in glutamine synthetase mRNA observed during terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1586199376,"The amino acid analogs canavanine, 3-hydroxynorvaline, thialysine, 6-fluorotryptophan, m-fluorotyrosine, and 2-fluorophenylalanine were incorporated into proteins, synthesized in pig intestinal mucosal explants, and their effect on molecular processing and intracellular transport of microvillar enzymes studied. Unless they were used in combination, none of the analogs drastically reduced the expression of aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2) or sucrase-isomaltase (EC 3.2.1.48, EC 3.2.1.10), but to a varying extent, they all slowed the rate of transport to the apical surface. In contrast, the cellular export of a secretory protein, apolipoprotein A-1, was largely unaffected. For the microvillar enzymes, all six analogs caused an accumulation of the transient, high mannose-glycosylated form, indicating an analog-sensitive stage prior to the Golgi-associated processing. For aminopeptidase N, this arrest was shown to correlate with a reduced ability of its transient high mannose-glycosylated form to form homodimers as judged from cross-linking experiments, suggesting dimerization to be obligatory for transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1526231806,"The effect of insulin to increase the cell surface concentration of various receptors is accompanied by an increase in the concentration of clathrin assembled on the plasma membrane (Corvera, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2413-2416). In the present study, clathrin-coated membranes were purified from isolated adipocytes labeled isotopically with [32P]orthophosphate. Analysis of the coated vesicle preparation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed the presence of a cluster of phosphopeptides of 90-100 kDa as well as other phosphorylated species of 125, 70, 58, 50, 43, and 32 kDa. Incubation of the coated vesicles in alkaline pH resulted in the elution of the majority of the phosphopeptides, suggesting that these components are part of the clathrin coat and not integral membrane proteins. A pronounced increase in the amount of phosphate incorporated into the 125-kDa species was observed in response to stimulation of labeled cells by low concentrations of insulin. Phosphoamino acid analysis of an acid hydrolysate of this band revealed that its phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues. The increased serine phosphorylation of this protein was apparent after only 2 min of exposure of cells to insulin and persisted for at least 60 min. The effect of insulin to increase the cell surface concentration of receptors and the assembly of clathrin on the plasma membrane displays a similar time course. Phorbol esters or dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not mimic the effects of insulin to stimulate the incorporation of [32P]phosphate into the 125-kDa polypeptide. Phosphorylation of the 125-kDa polypeptide was not observed after incubation of purified adipocyte-coated vesicles with [gamma-32P]ATP, suggesting that the kinase responsible for this reaction may not be contained within the clathrin-coated vesicle itself. These results suggest that phosphorylation of this 125-kDa polypeptide in intact cells may play a role in the regulation of clathrin-coated membrane formation and receptor-mediated endocytosis in response to insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1579435311,"The effect of 3,3-difluoroglutamate (F2Glu) on the reaction catalyzed by rat liver folypolyglutamate synthetase was investigated. F2Glu was a potent, concentration-dependent inhibitor of poly(gamma-glutamylation) using [3H]Glu and either methotrexate (4-NH2-10-CH3PteGlu) or tetrahydrofolate as substrates. It was determined that F2Glu acted as an alternate substrate, but in contrast to the previously characterized alternate substrate 4-fluoroglutamate (McGuire, J.J., and Coward, J.K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6747-6754), it did not terminate polyglutamate chain elongation. Instead, F2Glu promoted chain elongation. Thus, synthesis of products from [3H]methotrexate containing 1 and 2 additional amino acid residues occurred at a substantially higher rate in the presence of F2Glu when compared to identical reactions in the presence of Glu; this was more pronounced for the product containing 2 additional residues. Identities of the products were established by their respective chromatographic elution positions and by limit digestion with gamma-glutamyl hydrolases. Ligation of Glu to 4-NH2-10-CH3PteGlu-gamma-(3,3-difluoroglutamate) was also enhanced. These results are consistent with F2Glu enhancing the synthesis of poly(gamma-glutamate) metabolites at the level of either the incoming amino acid (glutamate analog) or the gamma-glutamyl acceptor species. F2Glu is thus the first glutamate analog which enhances chain elongation catalyzed by folypolyglutamate synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1502195720,"When His248 of the transcription factor S-II was replaced by alanine or tyrosine, the activity of the resulting mutants was less than 30% of that of the wild-type S-II. When Arg246, Glu247, and His248 were all replaced by leucine, the resulting mutant showed complete loss of activity. These results indicate that the amino acid sequence Arg-Glu-His at positions 246-248 of S-II is important for its stimulatory activity. The mutant S-II with no activity could not form a complex with RNA polymerase II, unlike wild-type S-II, but retained ability to interact with DNA."
