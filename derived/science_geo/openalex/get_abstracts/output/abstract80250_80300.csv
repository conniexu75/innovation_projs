https://openalex.org/W2022332003,"Microinjection of L-glutamate into the intermediate nucleus tractus solitarii in anesthetized rats elicits hypotension, bradycardia, and apnea, simulating baroreceptor reflexes. Ablation of the nodose ganglion results in selective reduction of high-affinity uptake of L-glutanate in the nucleus tractus solitarii. L-Glutamate may be the neurotransmitter of afferent nerve fibers from arterial baroreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1486999320,"When normal human blood lymphocytes are treated with mitogen in the presence of [3H]putrescine, label is incorporated into a few cellular proteins. Labeled N-(gamma-glutamyl) putrescine, N1-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, and N8-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine were identified in exhaustive proteolytic digests of the cellular protein fraction. The enzyme-mediated clotting of rat seminal plasma to which 14C-labeled spermidine and spermine are added is accompanied by incorporation of the polyamines into a number of seminal plasma proteins. Proteolytic digests of the protein fraction from this clotted seminal plasma contain labeled N1-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, N8-(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, N1,N8-bis(gamma-glutamyl)spermidine, N1-(gamma-glutamyl)spermine, and N1,N12-bis(gamma-glutamyl)spermine. These findings support a proposal that polyamines serve as substrates for transglutaminases both in cells and in an extracellular fluid. They show differences in cellular and extracellular substrate properties of the polyamines and indicate cross-linking through these amines in the extracellular system, but provide no evidence for such cross-linking in the cells."

Irradiation of tissues with visible light in the presence of ANAPP3 resulted in an irreversible antagonism, which was prevented when adenosine triphosphate was present. In the absence of light, the antagonism was reversible and may have resulted from an autoinhibition phenomenon. Responses to acetylcholine, histamine, norepinephrine, and potassium chloride were not affected by ANAPP3."
https://openalex.org/W2006963291,"A discussion of drug-receptor theory is used to show that the three-dimensional structure, or shape, of molecules is important for biological activity. The computer-assisted molecular modeling system at Merck is described, and it is shown that this system is useful for generating and storing molecular structures, determining preferred conformation, comparing molecular shapes, and computing molecular properties. Applications of the system to the study of anti-inflammatory drugs, somatostatin-like compounds, and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors are summarized."

The fluorescence lifetimes of the coenzyme was measured directly with a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser and a streak camera in picosecond region. The values of lifetime of FAD fluorescence in the monomer and dimer were 130 +/- 20 ps and 40 +/- 10 ps, respectively. The relative quantum yield of the fluorescence of FAD combined with the protein to that of free FAD depended on the concentration of the enzyme; it was higher at lower concentration. Comparing the lifetime with relative quantum yield of FAD combined with the protein, it is concluded that the fluorescence is quenched mostly by a dynamic process. These results indicate that the distance between the isoalloxazine nucleus and a quencher is nearer in the dimer than in the monomer."

https://openalex.org/W133574323,"y-Glutamyltranspeptidase and an aminopeptidase which cleaves cysteinylglycine and its S-derivatives are associated with the brush border membrane of the rat renal proximal tubule. The orientations of the two activities were determined using isolated brush border membrane vesicles. Papain treatment of isolated vesicles results in 90 to 95% solubilization of the peptidase and transpeptidase activities without releasing alkaline phosphatase activity or altering the internal volume of the vesicles. At least 92% of either activity can be inactivated or precipitated by indirect immunoprecipitation following the addition of specific Fab antibodies. The residual y-glutamyltranspeptidase and peptidase activities associated with papain-treated vesicles do not interact with Fab antibodies. Therefore, the resistant activities observed in both procedures are due to the same population of enzyme molecules. The inability to precipitate this population of enzyme molecules by indirect immunoprecipitation indicates that the resistant activities are associated with vesicles which have no y-glutamyltranspeptidase orientated externally. The ability of Triton X-100 to make the resistant peptidase activity accessible to interact with Fab antibodies suggests that resistant molecules are located inside the membrane. In addition, isopycnic centrifugation of untreated and of papain-treated vesicles established that the resistant activities are associated with a unique population of vesicles. Collectively, these results indicate that the resistant y-glutamyltranspeptidase and peptidase activities are orientated on the internal surface of a unique population of vesicles which may be inverted. Therefore, in vivo the two activities are exclusively orientated on the luminal surface of the brush border membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1576307857,"Abstract A total clone bank of cDNAs synthesized from mouse liver poly(A)-RNA was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12 RR1 using the plasmid pBR322. Sequences of cDNAs were inserted into the PST-I site of pBR322 by the G-C-tailing method. Bulk preparations of these cDNA sequences were obtained by treatment of the resultant total hybrid plasmid population with PST-I. Aliquots of this cDNA material were then labeled with 32P by nick translation using E. coli DNA polymerase I for the preparation of hybridization probes. Experiments involving the back-hybridization of these probes to the total hybrid-plasmid clone bank population revealed that virtually all of the liver poly(A)-RNA sequences were represented in the total clone bank. The long term stability of these sequences residing in RR1 host cells was then examined through extensive serial passage of the initial total clone cell population culture. The results showed: 1) that the small percentage of natural pBR322 molecules (containing no cDNA inserts) usually present in such total clone bank preparations do not outgrow the respectively hybrid specie of plasmids in these populations: 2) few, if any, cDNA sequences are completely lost; and 3) some redistribution of the abundant and more unique DNA sequences probably does occur. The use of total clone hybrid-plasmid populations (constructed from poly(A)-RNA isolated from different tissues) described here should allow the identification of tissue-specific RNA sequences through the use of cross-hybridizaton techniques."

https://openalex.org/W1584613840,"The apparent glutathione oxidase activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase is due to nonenzymatic oxidation and transhydrogenation reactions of cysteinylglycine, an enzymatic product formed from glutathione by hydrolysis or autotranspeptidation. Since cysteinylglycine reacts with oxygen more rapidly than does glutathione, the rate of disulfide formation is increased and either cystinyl-bis-glycine or the mixed disulfide of cysteinylglycine and glutathione forms as an intermediate product. Nonenzymatic transhydrogenation reactions of these disulfides with glutathione yield glutathione disulfide and thus account for the apparent glutathione oxidase activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. A sensitive assay for glutathione oxidation is described, and it is shown that covalent inhibitors of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase abolish the oxidase activity of the purified enzyme and of crude homogenates of mouse and rat kidney."

https://openalex.org/W1626070385,"Protein n' of Escherichia coli is required for formation of the prepriming complex in replication of the single-stranded circle of phiX174 DNA. The protein, purified to near homogeneity, possesses ATPase (dATPase) activity in the presence of single-stranded, but not duplex, DNAs. Except for phiX174 DNA, ATPase activity is completely suppressed by coating the DNA with single strand binding protein (SSB). phiX174 DNA possesses a unique sequence with a potential hairpin structure that is recognized as an effector (Shlomai, J., and Kornberg, A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 799-803). Sequences with secondary structure in SSB-coated M13 DNA which are recognized by RNA polymerase, and in coated G4 DNA by primase, are inert for protein n'. Approximately 30 of the 180 molecules of SSB bound to phiX DNA are destabilized by protein n' in an ATP-dependent reaction. These actions by protein n' may be important in recognizing an origin for forming the prepriming complex that leads to initiation of phiX complementary strand synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1479721033,"As a preliminary to a study of the biogenesis of individual plasma membrane glycoproteins, the marker enzyme nucleotide pyrophosphatase (NPPase) and a major rat liver plasma membrane sialoprotein, subsequently found to be identical with the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), were purified 10,000- and 2,000-fold, respectively, from rat liver. Both were amphipathic proteins which formed defined micellar complexes with detergents and aggregated in their absence. Gel filtration, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate showed the Triton X-100 complex of NPPase to contain a single 150,000-dalton peptide, while that of DPP IV was composed of two 120,000-dalton subunits; each complex also contained about 150,000-dalton Triton X-100. Trypsin cleaved the detergent complexes with release of major hydrophilic fragments which no longer bound detergent micelles; the accompanying change in peptide size was small for NPPase and undetectable for DPP IV, which also retained the dimer structure of its native form. DPP IV was the only major glycoprotein in rat liver plasma membrane which bound strongly to wheat germ agglutinin. Monospecific rabbit antibodies against NPPase and DPP IV precipitated the antigens without affecting their enzymatic activities."
https://openalex.org/W1673119545,"A theoretical analysis has been derived which allows the analytical calculation of the complete distribution of 18O-labeled Pi species expected to occur during medium Pi equilibrium HOH exchange of [18O]Pi and to be produced by intermediate Pi equilibrium HOH exchange during net hydrolysis of [18O]PPi or other labeled phosphate compounds. The observed distributions with catalysis by yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase are found to agree closely with the theoretical values indicating that the exchange reaction can be adequately described by a unique value of the partitioning of bound Pi between release from the enzyme versus formation of bound PPi with loss of an oxygen to the water. The limitations on the exclusion of other mechanisms are discussed. The extent of this partitioning does change, however, under some experimental conditions. At low pH, with activation by Mg2+ or Mn2+, the relative rate of release of Pi is found to increase. The extent of exchange is also dependent on the nature of the activating metal, being greatest with Co2+. During PPi hydrolysis with PPi in excess over Mg2+, a shift to lower extents of exchange is observed."
https://openalex.org/W2107901437,"We have used a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-infected rat hepatoma cell line as a model system for studying glucocorticoid action. These cells induce tyrosine aminotransferase and MMTV in response to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. The major viral antigen, a glycoprotein of 52,000 daltons (gp52), appears on the surface of infected cells in amounts which reflect the cytoplasmic content of viral RNA. Using an anti-gp52 antiserum and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), we have selected variants which display low levels of pg52 in the presence of the hormone. Multiple cycles of enrichment for cells that fluoresce weakly in the presence of hormone have generated a population which fails to produce a detectable increase in cell surface gp52 in response to dexamethasone. This population of nonresponders and a number of independent clones derived from this population were analyzed for their ability to induce gp52 and TAT and for these presence of glucocorticoid receptors. All nonresponder clones exhibited little or no induction of either glucocorticoid-inducible marker. Two of the clones contained reduced levels of glucocrticoid receptor, while the remainder of the clones showed no detectable specific hormone binding. These results provide genetic evidence that a single class of glucocorticoid receptors is involved in the induction of both MMTV and TAT in HTC cells."

https://openalex.org/W1553356263,"Glutamine synthetase specific activity increases greater than 100-fold during the insulin-mediated differentiation of confluent 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes. Incubation of the adipocytes for 22 h with 0.5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP plus 0.5 mM theophylline, 0.2 mM 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, 10 micro M epinephrine, or 1 microgram of alpha 1-24 adrenocorticotropic hormone/ml decreased glutamine synthetase by greater than 60%. During the same incubation period, there was no effect of these compounds on protein or on the specific activities of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase or hexokinase. In the presence of 0.5 mM theophylline, the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in glutamine synthetase activity was half-maximal at 50 micro M dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Furthermore, between 10 micro M and 5 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in glutamine synthetase was similar in the absence or presence of 1 microgram of insulin/ml. Immunotitration of glutamine synthetase activity from 3T3 adipocytes indicates that the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in the activity is due to a decrease in the cellular content of glutamine synthetase molecules. We studied the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on the synthesis and degradation of glutamine synthetase. Synthesis rate was estimated from the incorporation of L-[35S]methionine into glutamine synthetase during a 60-min incubation period. Degradation rate was estimated from the first order disappearance of radioactivity from glutamine synthetase in 3T3 adipocytes previously incubated with L-[35S]methionine. Glutamine synthetase was isolated by immunoprecipitation followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Incubation of 3T3 adipocytes with dibutyrl cyclic AMP resulted in a rapid decline in the apparent synthesis rate of glutamine synthetase. In addition, dibutyryl cyclic AMP treatment increased the initial rate of glutamine synthetase degradation. The half-life of glutamine synthetase was 24.5 h in control cultures and 16 h in dibutyryl cyclic AMP-treated cultures. In contrast, dibutyryl cyclic AMP had little effect on the synthesis or degradation of soluble protein. Our data indicate that the dibutyryl cyclic AMP-mediated decrease in 3T3 adipocyte glutamine synthetase activity results from a decrease in the synthesis rate and an increase in the initial degradation rate of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1535903873,"Antibodies to purified nucleotide pyrophosphatase (NPPase) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were used to study the biogenesis of these rat liver plasma membrane glycoproteins in vivo. Following injection of tritiated leucine, the radioactivity in NPPase and DPP IV decayed at markedly different rates in the plasma membrane, with apparent half-lives of about 1 and 5 days, respectively. In short term experiments, labeling of total plasma membrane proteins was rapid and insensitive to colchicine, while labeling of both NPPase and DPP IV showed a lag of about 15 min, followed by colchcine-sensitive/cycloheximide-insensitive increases to half-maximal and maximal values at about 1 and 2 h, respectively. A peak of labeled DPP IV in rough microsomes at 15 min showed increased mobility on polyacrylamide gels and was largely inaccessible to antibodies in intact microsomes, consistent with its being an underglycosylated precursor, exposed on the cisternal side of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, the behavior of unlabeled DPP IV in preparations of rough microsomes and Golgi was consistent with its being contributed by contaminating right-side-out plasma membrane vesicles. This conclusion was also necessary to fit the tracer kinetic data to a simple membrane-flow model, which gave precursor pools (1 microgram/g of liver) and fluxes (1 microgram/h/g of liver) for both DPP IV and NPPase which were about 3 orders of magnitude less than those for the synthesis of rat serum albumin. Thus, unlike hepatoma tissue culture cells (Doyle, D., Baumann, H., England, B., Friedman, E., Hou, E., and Tweto, J. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 967-973), normal rat liver does not contain large amounts of preformed intracellular plasma membrane precursors."

https://openalex.org/W1907705325,"Synthetic repeat polypeptides analogous in sequence to the valine-rich regions of elastin have been tested as substrates for purified bovine aorta lysyl oxidase. These polypeptides, HCO(phi-Pro-Gly-Gly)n-Val-OMe, HCO(Val-Pro-Gly-phi-Gly)n-Val-OMe, and HCO-Val-(Ala-Pro-Gly-phi-Gly-Val)n-OMe, where phi = Val or Lys at approximately a 4:1 ratio and where n greater than or equal to 40, are models of the tetra-, penta-, or hexapeptide repeat sequences found in elastin. alpha-Aminoadipic delta-semialdehyde is generated in each of these upon incubation with lysyl oxidase at 37 degrees C, whereas the aldol and anhydrolysinonorleucine bifunctional cross-linkages were formed only in the incubation of enzyme with polypentapeptide. Incubation of the polypentapeptide at 55 degrees C, which enhances coacervation of the peptide, increases aldehyde formation and generates a much higher ratio of cross-linkages to aldehyde than occurred at 37 degrees C. These results demonstrate that lysyl oxidase can oxidize lysine in synthetic polypeptides and suggest important conformational aspects of lysyl oxidase substrates which may control substrate potential as well as the ability of peptidyl aldehyde, once formed by the enzyme, to condense to cross-linkage products."

https://openalex.org/W1509282991,"The coupling with polypeptide synthesis of the ribosome-elongation factor G (EF-G)-dependent GTPase activity was studied in a highly purified system with well characterized NH4Cl-washed ribosomes which were from 55 to 67% active in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. The lowest stoichiometries of total GTP hydrolysis to polyphenylalanine incorporation (2.4 to 2.8) were observed at concentrations of MgCl2 (4 to 6.5 mM) slightly lower than the Mg2+ optimum for polyphenylalanine synthesis (7 to 8 mM), in a system containing 80 mM NH4Cl or KCl. For minimal stoichiometry, the concentration of EF-G should be rate-limiting, whereas that of EF-T (EF-Tu.EF-Ts) and aminoacyl-tRNA should be in excess, since the coupling of the EF-G GTPase activity depends on ribosomes in pretranslocative state. Under this condition, the apparent Km values for GTP of GTPase activity and polyphenylalanine synthesis are identical, and they are about an order of magnitude lower than the Km of the ribosome-EF-G-dependent GTPase activity uncoupled from polypeptide synthesis. The stoichiometry was calculated without the usual correction fro GTP hydrolysis obtained in the same system lacking elongation factor T or aminoacyl-tRNA. Such a correction causes overestimation of the uncoupled EF-G GTPase activity still present in the complete system, leading to artificially low stoichiometric values."

L. (1979) Mol. Pharmacol. 15, 263-270). We have now measured the tyrosine content and the rate of dihydroxyphenylalanine production in these cells. Incubation with 56 mM K+ or with cholera toxin increases the rate of dihydroxyphenylalanine production but decreases the tyrosine content of the cells. We have also measured the uptake of tyrosine into pheochromocytoma cells. The rate of tyrosine uptake is more than 1 order of magnitude greater than the rate of dihydroxyphenylalanine production. Moreover, tyrosine uptake is not affected by cholera toxin and is decreased by approximately 30% in media that contain 56 mM K+. These results provide direct evidence that tyrosine 3-monooxygenase regulates catecholamine synthesis in pheochromocytoma cells and that incubation with 56 mM K+ or with cholera toxin causes the activation of this enzyme in these cells."

D-amino acid oxidase is inactivated by reaction with a low molar excess of dansyl chloride at pH 6.6, with complete inactivation accompanied by incorporation of 1.7 dansyl residues per mol of enzyme-bound flavin. The presence of benzoate, a potent competitive inhibitor, protects substantially against inactivation. Evidence is presented that the inactivation is due to dansylation of an active site histidine residue. Reactivation may be obtained by incubation with hydroxylamine. Diethylpyrocarbonate also inactivates the enzyme and modifies the labeling pattern with dansyl chloride. 2. Butanedione in the presence of borate reacts rapidly to inactivate D-amino acid oxidase. Reactivation is obtained spontaneously on removal of borate, implicating reaction of butanedione with an active site arginine residue. 3. Fluorodinitrobenzene appears to behave as an active site-directed reagent when mixed with D-amino acid oxidase at pH 7.4. Complete inactivation is obtained with incorporation of 2.0 dinitrophenyl residues per mol of enzyme-bound flavin. Again benzoate protects against inactivation; only one dinitrophenyl residue is incorporated in the presence of benzoate.

With this labeled compound and the previously synthesized gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxy[3,5-3H]benzene, the stoichiometry of ring substitution was determined for the tyrosinase-catalyzed metabolic pathway of Agaricus bisporus. In this pathway, gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene is hydroxylated to gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene which is oxidized to gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone and a compound of previously unknown structure, 490. The results indicated that the quinone was derived from gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone without further ring substitution. A base-catalyzed, nonenzymatic reaction of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-benzoquinone was observed which yielded a compound with a 490 nm chromophore. gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase cleavage of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene led to the release of 4-aminocatechol which air-oxidized to a compound with identical spectral properties to 490. The structure of was thus determined to be 2-hydroxy-4-imino-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-one(2-hydroxy-4-iminoquinone). The tyrosinase-catalyzed hydroxylation of gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene was found to be optimal at pH 8.0, while the enzymatic oxidation of gamma-L-glutaminyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzene was optimal at pH 6.0."

The glutamate uptake did not occur to a significant extent in these vesicles when glutathione was added externally. The uptake of glutamate in the reconstituted system was sensitive to the temperature of incubation and to the inhibitors (serine-borate, azaserine, and 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. The accumulated product during the transport of glutamate in the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase reconstituted system containing intravesicular glutathione was identified as gamma-glutamyl-glutamate. These results indicate that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase mediates the translocation of glutamate in vitro and provides evidence in support of its role in the transport of amino acids in natural membranes."
