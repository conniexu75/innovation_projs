Stable microcapsules 1 to 100 micro in diameter, with semipermeable membranes, can be made by depositing polymer around emulsified aqueous droplets, either by interfacial coacervation or by interfacial polycondensation. Aqueous suspensions of enzyme-loaded microcapsules act well on small-molecular substrates both in vitro and in vivo."

The precision of their performances and the ease with which the training was accomplished suggest greater powers of conceptualization than are ordinarily attributed to animals.

On the 4th or 5th day in culture they abruptly fuse, form long multinucleated myotubes, and begin to synthesize myosin. Cultured cells exposed to 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporate this analog of thymidine into their DNA. Cells with such falsified DNA are reversibly inhibited from forming myotubes and synthesizing myosin; such cells, however, continue to synthesize the various species of molecules required for cell multiplication."

After infection of such cells with the single-stranded RNA phage R17, the RNA most rapidly labeled by a pulse of tritiated uridine sedimented in a broad band in the 16S region of sucrose gradients. The effect of ribonuclease on this material and its behavior during a ""chase"" period in nonradioactive medium suggest that it consists of a core of double-stranded RNA, one strand of which-the viral strand-is continually displaced by a growing strand forming single-stranded tails and ultimately free 27S viral RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2025319770,"EVIDENCE of a sympathetic nerve supply to the fat cells in adipose tissue has been based on histological observations of material stained with silver or methylene blue1,2 and on biochemical analysis of the noradrenaline content3,4. Further, an increased production of free fatty acids from adipose tissue after nerve stimulation has been reported5, as have the inhibitory effects on this production resulting from denervation5 or treatment with reserpine3. The concept of a direct innervation of fat cells seems also to be consistent with the fact that noradrenaline has an adipokinetic effect both in vivo and in vitro, although certain species are apparently unresponsive6,7. With the fluorescence method described by Falck et al.8, Carlsson, Falck and Hillarp9 and Falck10, noradrenaline can be demonstrated with very good resolution even in small nerve fibres, and it may now be possible to make more adequate observations of their distribution in adipose tissue."

The three enolases do not appear to be artifacts of isolation, and their electrophoretic patterns are completely reproducible. The patterns are also highly characteristic for each individual species of fish, and together with the overall myogen patterns they represent unequivocal means of taxonomical identification."

https://openalex.org/W2088474553,"PREVIOUS reports have shown that penicillinase (β-lactamase) is not an inducible enzyme in strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Aerobacter; but Proteus species have not been investigated1–3. There is also a species variation in penicillinase activity with different substrates3. Cephalosporinase activity has been described in many species of gram-negative bacilli4 and is associated with cephalosporin resistance in Proteus species5. In the work recorded here, inducibility of Cephalosporinase and penicillinase was investigated in strains of Proteus morgani, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri and P. mirabilis. The strains were all resistant to ampicillin ((D(–)α-aminophenylacetamido)-penicillanic acid) and cephalothin ((7-thiophene-2-acet-amido)-cephalosporanic acid), apart from P. mirabilis which was sensitive to cephalothin. Many strains of P. mirabilis are also sensitive to ampicillin, but these were not included in the present investigation as they either inactivate benzylpenicillin or cephalosporin slowly or not at all."

https://openalex.org/W2076403779,"THE concept that high-level melanocytes (Langerhans cells) are effete, except in a melanogenic sense, has required modification since our previously reported demonstration of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and non-specific esterase activity in these cells1, and it has been postulated by Jarrett2,3 that material elaborated by high-level melanocytes may influence the mode of keratinization of the epidermis. In a more detailed discussion by Jarrett and Spearman4 it is suggested that the effect on keratinization might be achieved by augmenting the catabolic processes in the transitional zone of the epidermis, thus influencing the rate and degree of cytoplasmic dissolution occurring during keratinization and consequently altering the type of horny layer produced. This involves either the transfer of lysosomes from the high-level dendritic cells to the epidermal cells4, a cytocrine5 transfer similar to the distribution of melanin granules in the basal layer of the epidermis, or alternatively the inclusion of the dendritic cells in the lytic process. If this incorporation of supplementary hydrolases into granular layer cytolysis is to be regarded as the mechanism by which high-level melanocytes modify epidermal keratinization, then it is mandatory that these high-level cells should contain considerable concentrations of these enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W2088079530,"THE urease reaction has been used as a diagnostic method for a number of groups of bacteria. It is particularly useful in differentiating Proteus species from enteric pathogens1,2 and has also been used to differentiate Brucella suis from B. abortus and B. melitensis3. It also has been suggested that urease activity may serve as an indicator of pathogenic potential and of drug resistance among some groups of bacteria4–6. The urease activity of bacteria can readily be determined by inoculating the organisms on to a number of bacteriological media1,2. Seneca et al.6,7 reported that urease activity was observed in cell-free extracts obtained by sonic oscillation, even in groups characterized as lacking this enzyme by sensitive culture methods. The crude extracts such as were used in those investigations may contain large amounts of compounds which readily yield alkaline products; for example, extracts from enteric bacteria have been shown to produce amines from amino-acids8. Therefore, in order to eliminate spurious results, the more specific method involving reaction of acetylbenzoyl with urea has been used to determine urease activity of cell-free preparations9."
https://openalex.org/W1972556282,"European biomedical research is now in full resurgence, 19 years after the devastation of the World War II. The more advanced countries of Western Europe are gradually approaching a position of economic self-sufficiency with respect to research. However, certain problems persist. Lingering nationalism and language differences continue to inhibit Europe from finding its full strength as a scientific community. Educational reforms, manpower planning, and scientific support still lag far behind the technologic recovery of science. International pooling of scientific interests and activities, so necesary for the smaller countries, has been slow to develop. The bonds between American and European biomedical science are extraordinarily strong and healthy, the result of the huge flow of young Europeans to America and of American scientists to Europe for training. These training exchanges have done much more than extend technologic competence. The two communities, one European, the other American, have different attitudes and atmospheres for research, which complement and strengthen each other. The benefits which lie in collaborative research and training among laboratories of the two communities are becoming more and more apparent and no doubt will lead to new levels of creativity and productivity in biomedical research."

https://openalex.org/W2055510020,"Abstract : Activities of four amidases and alkaline phosphatase were studied in lymphoid cells obtained from the thymuses of rats during the first 21 days of post natal life. Alkaline phosphatase activity increases rapidly from a value of 1.4 on day one to 24.4 on day 2, and declines steadily until day 7 from which time there is a constant activity (3.5) through day 21. Similar activity profiles obtain for leucyl, alanyl and phenylalanyl amidases showing maxima on day 2 of 26.2, 28.9, and 21.3 respectively. Comparatively constant activity levels are reached after one week, leucyl having the lowest value, 3.7, phenylalanyl slightly higher, 4.5, and alanyl the highest, 9.3. Glycyl amidase activity is nil on day one, rises to a maximum activity of 12.4 on day 2, and falls off again to an immeasurable quantity by day 14. Histological examination of thymuses over the period studied revealed a relative increase in the number of large lymphoid cells. The changes in enzyme activities appear to reflect changes in the large thymocyte population. (Author)"
