https://openalex.org/W1517311101,"A successful nanotechnology will require nanomotors that can perform functions from switches to pumps and actuators. In their Perspective, Besenbacher and NÃ¸rskov discuss the study by Schmid et al., who show that tin islands on a copper surfaces propel themselves forward on the surface, drawing energy from alloy formation with the surface below. The system has about the same power-to-weight ratio as a car and may provide a paradigm for future nanomotors."
https://openalex.org/W2013022204,"Because objects only a few molecules across are too small to be seen or touched directly, scientists approach them essentially blind and numb. Now a team of physicists, chemists, biologists, and computer scientists at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has developed a tool that restores their eyes and fingers. It's called the nanoManipulator."

In her Perspective, Nisini explains how recent satellite missions have provided the first observational evidence that allows chemical models of star formation to be tested. Water is found to be initially low in abundance but to increase in abundance once a protostar has formed. The observations include protostars that are the precursors of sunlike stars, thus shedding light on water production in solar-type systems."

https://openalex.org/W1580837700,"Two decades after Iran's Islamic revolution, science in this politically isolated but oil-rich nation may be on the verge of resurgence. The nation's reform-minded president, Mohammad Khatami, and his allies are promising more money for R&D, reorganizing universities to beef up graduate education and research, and cracking open the door to closer cooperation with scientists abroad, including those in the United States. But Iran's government is walking a tightrope between hard-liners on the right who oppose reforms and liberal university students eager for change."
https://openalex.org/W1972512193,"Physicist Kunio Takayanagi of the Tokyo Institute of Technology has calculated that electrons should pass through the 1-nanometer gold wires he has crafted at speeds several orders of magnitude faster than those at which they pass through larger wires. If such wires could be fashioned into circuits, they could set the stage for even faster supercomputers."

https://openalex.org/W1484224702,"Large strains can build up in the slowly convecting mantle when it encounters less mobile regions, for example, at the bottom of rigid plates. In their Perspective, Mackwell and Rubie discuss new insights into the effect of this deformation on mantle rocks gained by Bystricky et al. Olivine, the major upper mantle material, is shown to decrease in strength without a change in deformation mechanism. Such a change was previously proposed to explain mantle processes."

https://openalex.org/W4240083480,"Building even the simplest nanomachines is a daunting challenge, but working models serve as springboards to grander designs. A classic example is the cantilever, an indispensable cog in the nanoworld that ushered in the scanning probe microscopy revolution. Today cantilevers, which resemble tiny diving boards, are the operating principle behind a host of experimental devices that could debut in the next decade."
https://openalex.org/W1515853384,"When a devastating earthquake rocked the Manjil region in Iran on 20 June 1990, the tremors also shook seismology research in that country. That night, Mohsen Ghafory-Ashtiany rolled out of his bed in Tehran and headed to the danger zone in northwestern Iran, where 13,000 persons perished and 60,000 were injured. He and his then-tiny staff surveyed the damage and mapped out a plan for bolstering earthquake research and preparedness."
https://openalex.org/W1521618185,"Despite institutions such as separate reading rooms for each sex, women are a growing presence at Iran's universities, making up nearly 60% of incoming classes, almost double their share in 1978. But as in many other countries, some female academics in Iran point to a glass ceiling that keeps their representation among university professors low."
https://openalex.org/W1571292555,"Middle Eastern scientists who for years have been yearning for a synchrotron may wind up with two. Last spring, SESAME (Synchrotron Radiation for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East), an 11-nation consortium formed to install and operate a first-generation synchrotron now mothballed in Germany, selected Jordan as the site of the 0.8 giga-electron-volt BESSY-I synchrotron, disappointing Armenian officials who had hoped to snare the prize. But this month Armenia moved to the head of the line for a second, brand-new synchrotron after securing a $15 million down payment from the U.S. Congress as part of a foreign-aid spending bill that would funnel $90 million to the country."
https://openalex.org/W1586100895,"A generation of physicists probing the extremes of gravity can trace its scientific heritage to one man: Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology. A recent symposium to mark Thorne's 60th birthday brought together nearly 200 experts on gravity at its strongest and strangest: the domains of black holes, colliding neutron stars, and other exotic deep-space objects. Participants came to honor their mentor, who has led the way in converting Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity from a purely theoretical science into an astrophysical and observational one."
https://openalex.org/W1964151514,"Last week, computer industry titan Gordon Moore and his wife, Betty, announced that they are creating a $5-billion-plus foundation to support scientific research, conservation, and higher education. Once fully funded within a few years, the foundation is expected to rank among the dozen largest charities based in the United States."
