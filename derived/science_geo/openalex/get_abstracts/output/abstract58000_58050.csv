https://openalex.org/W2059802140,"Despite excessive glucagon responses to infusion of arginine, plasma glucagon did not rise in six juvenile-type diabetics during severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia, whereas glucagon in the controls rose significantly. Thus in diabetics pancreatic alpha cells are insensitive to glucose even in the presence of large amounts of circulating insulin. An intrinsic defect common to both alpha and beta pancreatic cells-failure to recognize (or respond to) plasma glucose fluctuations-may be operative in juvenile diabetes."

The data are contrary to conventional notions of mitochondrial size, form, and number per cell and should lead to a reassessment of mitochondrial genetics and biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1564216598,"Abstract Reconstitution of 30 S ribosomal subunits from 16 S RNA and a mixture of purified individual 30 S ribosomal proteins has been studied. Proteins from the 30 S ribosomal subunit of Escherichia coli were purified by a combination of phosphocellulose and DEAE-chromatography, and Sephadex gel filtration. The proteins purified correspond to the 21 proteins generally accepted as 30 S proteins, with the exception of two proteins, P3b and P3c, which correspond to the protein S6 studied by other workers. P3b and P3c are closely related, and one is probably a derivative of the other. Using a mixture of these purified proteins, reconstitution of functionally active 30 S subunits has been demonstrated. Reconstituted particles had higher activities in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis than reference 30 S particles in several experiments. The functional activity of reconstituted particles was also examined in several other assays; these included natural messenger RNA-directed polypeptide synthesis, poly(U)-directed Phe-tRNA binding, AUG-directed fMet-puromycin formation, AUG-directed fMet-tRNA binding, and the binding of termination codon UAA in the presence of chain termination factors. In all cases, activities comparable to reference 30 S subunits were observed. The sedimentation properties and the protein composition of reconstituted particles were also similar to 30 S ribosomal subunits. The kinetics of reconstitution using purified protein mixtures was essentially identical with those of reconstitution using unfractionated 30 S proteins. These results strongly suggest that 21 purified 30 S proteins together with 16 S RNA are sufficient to reconstitute 30 S subunits, and that no essential 30 S components were lost during the fractionation and purification of the 30 S proteins. Single component omission experiments indicated that all purified proteins, except P1(S1) and P3b,c(S6), are required for full functional activity. A requirement for P9a(S16) has been shown in some, but not all, experiments. P3b,c(S6) and P9a(S16) have been shown to be involved in the reconstitution reaction in other experiments (Mizushima, S., and Nomura, M. (1970) Nature 226, 1214; Nomura, M. (1973) Science 179, 864) and therefore are 30 S components. It is still not clear whether P1(S1) should be considered a true 30 S protein or a ribosomal-associated factor."

https://openalex.org/W1551358827,"A ribonuclease which degrades RNA specifically in RNA·DNA hybrid structures has been purified 1500-fold from Escherichia coli B and 200-fold from E. coli strain D110 pol A1, endo I-, thy-). For maximal activity, the enzyme requires Mg2+ and the presence of a sulfhydryl reagent. The enzyme is capable of digesting more than 95% of the RNA in RNA·DNA hybrids to acid-soluble products. The products are oligonucleotides with 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini. The enzyme acts as an endonuclease and does not require free 3′ or 5′ termini for activity. However, it cannot cleave the phosphodiester bond covalently linking ribonucleotides to DNA. With circular single stranded DNA templates deoxynucleotide incorporation catalyzed by DNA polymerase II is dependent on RNA synthesis. This reaction can be stimulated by RNase H. During these studies an additional ribonuclease H activity was detected in E. coli B and purified 160-fold. Unlike RNase H, this activity is N-ethylmaleimide-resistant and sensitive to antiserum prepared against DNA polymerase I and attacks [3′-3H,5′-32P]poly(A)·poly(dT) in the 5′ → 3′ direction."
https://openalex.org/W1588205173,"Abstract Homogeneous Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I has been found to contain 1.0 ± 0.15 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme. Removal of zinc from the enzyme resulted in an apoenzyme which contained 0.06 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme. Polymerase activity of the apoenzyme was 7% of the polymerase activity of the holoenzyme. Complete restoration of polymerase activity of the apoenzyme was obtained by incubation with zinc ions. Co2+ and Mn2+ restored activity by about 80% and 45%, respectively, while Mg2+, Ni2+, Hg2+, Fe2+, and Cd2+ failed to do so. The Zn2+ on the enzyme was exchanged with radioactive 65Zn. Dialysis against the chelator 1,10-phenanthroline showed that the loss of 65Zn from the enzyme paralleled the loss of activity. These results indicate that the bound Zn2+ is essential for activity. To investigate the function of the enzyme-bound zinc, we studied the interaction of the enzyme with oligonucleotides, nucleoside monophosphates, and triphosphates by nuclear quadrupolar relaxation using 79Br- as a halide probe. The enzyme-bound Zn2+ in DNA polymerase was 80 times as effective as ionic Zn2+ in promoting the transverse nuclear quadrupolar relaxation (1/T2) of 79Br- at two frequencies. Titration of E. coli DNA polymerase I with an oligonucleotide (dT)6–9 by measuring 1/T2 of 79Br- showed that this oligonucleotide bound to the enzyme, forming a 1:1 complex, in which the access of Br- to the enzyme-bound zinc was diminished by a factor of 3. No such reduction in 1/T2 was observed with dTMP or dTTP or in titrating the zinc-free apoenzyme with (dT)6–9. These results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that Zn2+ in DNA polymerase functions by coordinating the 3'-OH terminus or growing point of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2000396676,"The symmetrical arrangements of monomers into such cylindrical structures as microfilaments of actin, flagella of bacteria, microtubules of many organisms, and the protein coats of viruses can be specified by citing the index numbers of two or three sets of contact parastichies, or helical ranks of monomers, as has been done in classical studies of phyllotaxis. This specification has the form k(m, n) or k(m, n, m+n), where m, n, and (m+n) are parastichy numbers specifying screw displacements, and k is the jugacy, or frequency of rotational symmetry. For simple structures, k = 1. This notation has the advantage of terseness and of indicating the basic isometries of these helically symmetrical structures. Theoretical models of the packing of spheres whose centers lie on the surface of a cylinder have been investigated geometrically. Their symmetry properties are discussed. Parameters of these models, such as the angular divergence, alpha, the longitudinal displacement between successive spheres, h, the radius of the cylinder, and the angles of inclination of the parastichies, have been computed for representative patterns. The ultrastructural symmetry of several biological structures of this sort has been inferred by comparison with these models. Actin, for example, has the symmetry (1, 2), Salmonella flagella, 2(2, 3, 5), the tobacco mosaic virus, (1, 16, 17) and the microtubules of many higher organisms, (6, 7, 13)."
https://openalex.org/W1531584941,"Abstract A stepwise assembly of the eukaryotic 80 S initiation complex [80 S, Met-tRNAf, mRNA] was achieved at 1.5 to 3 mm MgCI2 utilizing ribosomal factors and stripped 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits from mouse fibroblasts (L cells), rat liver Met-tRNAf, and reovirus mRNA. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose of a ribosomal wash from L cells yields three initiation factors (IF-L1, IF-L2, IF-L3) which mediate separate steps of the protein initiation sequence. IF-L3 contains the Met-tRNAf binding factor; IF-L2 functions as a mRNA insertion factor. The initiation sequence proceeds through at least four steps. Step 1, IF-L3 binds Met-tRNAf and GTP to form a ternary complex [IF-L3, Met-tRNAf, GTP] in the absence of ribosomes, mRNA, and MgCl2. Step 2, at 1.5 mm MgCl2, the ternary complex binds to the stripped 40 S subunit to form a [40 S, Met-tRNAf] complex, a reaction which is enhanced 3- to 5-fold by IF-L1. Step 3, at 1.5 mm MgCl2 in the presence of IF-L2, the [40 S, Met-tRNAf] complex binds reovirus mRNA to form a [40 S, Met-tRNAf, mRNA] complex. Step 4, at 3 mm MgCl2, the 60 S ribosomal subunit associates with the [40 S, Met-tRNAf, mRNA] complex to form the [80 S, Met-tRNAf, mRNA] initiation complex; IF-L1 significantly increases 80 S complex formation when IF-L2 and IF-L3 are limiting. The initiation complex formed in the sequential system is functional, and under appropriate conditions transfers its methionine to methionyl-puromycin or polypeptide. The sequence requires GTP; β,γ-methylene guanosine 5'-triphosphate replaces GTP in the first three steps, but not in the final step. Addition of 50 µm pactamycin selectively inhibits formation of the [80 S, Met-tRNAf, mRNA] complex in Step 4; other steps in the sequence are unaffected."

https://openalex.org/W1599175061,"Abstract Alkaline phosphatase purified from Escherichia coli contains up to 2 molecules of tightly bound inorganic phosphate per enzyme molecule. Removal of this endogenous ligand alters the stopped flow traces obtained for the hydrolysis of substrates at pH 5.5 and at pH 8.0. The pre-steady state burst transient of product release normally seen at pH 5.5 (τ-1 = 20 s-1) is transformed into an instantaneous burst of equal amplitude; an equivalent instant phase is created at pH 8.0, where no burst normally is seen. Addition of 1.5 eq of phosphate to phosphate-free enzyme restores the stopped flow trace completely to the normal burst transient. The maximum burst amplitude seen at all stoichiometries of enzyme preincubated with phosphate at pH 7.4 before reaction with substrate at pH 5.5 is 1.4 to 1.6 moles of product released per mole of enzyme and not 1.0 as previously reported. This amplitude is decreased if enzyme is preincubated with endogenous or added phosphate at pH values below 6.5. These results suggest that: (a) during the steady state turnover of substrate, the enzyme shuttles between two conformations, one of which binds substrate preferentially and catalyzes substrate hydrolysis and one of which binds phosphate preferentially and has no catalytic activity; the former conformation is thermodynamically preferred in the absence of phosphate; and (b) the active sites on the alkaline phosphatase molecule may be equivalent and independent, at least in the pre-steady state."
https://openalex.org/W1584432525,"Abstract Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize urea as a sole nitrogen source; this compound is degraded to CO2 and NH3 by a multienzyme complex (Whitney, P. A., and Cooper, T. G. (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 49, 45) composed of urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase. Since these activities are present in cultures grown in media containing urea, arginine, or a purine base, the nature of the inducer was investigated. The data presented here indicate that it is the intermediate compound, allophanate, which is the inducer of both urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase. This conclusion is based on the observation that: (a) urea induces both activities in a wild type strain, (b) urea has no effect on the basal levels of allophanate hydrolase produced by mutants lacking urea carboxylase, and (c) urea has no effect on the high constitutive level of urea carboxylase produced by a mutant lacking allophanate hydrolase. Consistent with this view is the observation that a urea analogue, formamide, cannot induce allophanate hydrolase in a strain lacking urea carboxylase activity, whereas an allophanate analogue, hydantoic acid, is able to serve as an inducer in such a strain. Both of these compounds are able to effect the induction of both activities in a wild type strain. Mutants blocked in either arginase or urea carboxylase were also used to show that the derepression of allophanate hydrolase following the onset of nitrogen starvation is, in fact, internal induction, and is contingent upon the ability of the cells to produce the inducer, allophanate, from internal arginine and urea pools."
https://openalex.org/W1585398582,"Abstract Spectrophotometric titration studies at pH 8.0 have revealed that pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binds as a Schiff base to the catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase with a stoichiometry of 3 pyridoxal phosphates per trimer and a dissociation constant of 0.9 µm. The ultraviolet absorption of the Schiff base near 430 nm is lost upon addition of the inhibitor N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) or the substrate carbamyl-P. In steady state kinetic studies, pyridoxal-P was found to be a competitive inhibitor of carbamyl-P, with an inhibition constant of 4 ± 2 µm. Pyridoxal does not bind to or inhibit the catalytic subunit. These results imply that pyridoxal-P binds at the active site not only through a Schiff base but also through noncovalent, ionic interactions with the phosphate binding region. Reduction of the Schiff base with sodium borohydride yields an N-e-pyridoxyl-l-lysine derivative of the enzyme with 2.9 to 3.0 pyridoxal-P incorporated per catalytic trimer. This reduced derivative is inactive but still binds 3 molecules of PALA per catalytic trimer at pH 8.0. However, the binding of PALA is characterized by at least two dissociation constants in the range 100 to 10 µm. PALA binds much more tightly to unmodified catalytic subunit at pH 8 with a single dissociation constant of about 0.1 µm. Photo-oxidation of the unreduced catalytic subunit-pyridoxal-P Schiff base causes loss of 90% to 95% of the activity and loss of 2.0 ± 0.5 histidine residues per chain. No other amino acid is found to be modified by amino acid analysis. However, 0.5 ± 0.05 molecules per chain of an unknown derivative of pyridoxal-P derivative are covalently bound. Covalently linked dimers and trimers of the catalytic chains are also formed, especially at high protein concentrations. At low concentrations at which dimer and trimer formation is negligible, the covalent incorporation of 0.5 pyridoxal-P per chain does not account for the almost complete loss of enzyme activity. Therefore, the loss of histidine is correlated with loss of activity. These studies indicate that 1 lysine residue and 2 histidine residues are probably near the active site of aspartate transcarbamylase."
https://openalex.org/W1580308416,"Abstract Studies using highly purified cysteine desulfhydrase from Salmonella typhimurium reveal that only a small fraction of the cysteine utilized by the enzyme appears as pyruvate. The isolation of 2-methyl-2, 4-thiazolidinedicarboxylic acid from reaction mixtures offers an explanation for this unusual stoichiometry. The relative amounts of pyruvate and thiazolidine produced during a reaction depend upon the cysteine concentration, pH, and the presence of a protein termed Fraction B, which prevents the formation of the thiazolidine. We propose that 2-aminoacrylate may be an intermediate in the formation of 2-methyl-2, 4-thiazolidinedicarboxylic acid. Substrate velocity curves for cysteine desulfhydrase reveal positive cooperativity with an n value of 1.9 and a Km, for l-cysteine of 0.17 to 0.21 mm. The product, sulfide, inhibits the reaction with a Ki of 0.010 mm. Sulfide inhibition is of the linear competitive type at high cysteine concentrations, but it becomes nonlinear and more pronounced at low cysteine concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1524606575,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae can utilize arginine or urea as sole nitrogen source. Arginase degrades arginine to ornithine and urea; urea is catabolized to CO2 and NH3 by the urea degradation system which is composed of a urea carboxylase and an allophanate hydrolase. The arginine analogue, homoarginine, was shown to function as a non-metabolizable inducer of arginase; it is also a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme. Studies on the induction of arginase and of the urea degradation system in a wild type yeast strain grown on minimal medium with ammonia as the nitrogen source have shown that: (a) arginine induces both activities, (b) urea induces only the urea degradation system, (c) homoarginine induces only arginase, and (d) the removal of ammonia, i.e. nitrogen starvation, results in the production of both activities. Starvation of an arginine auxotroph for both arginine and nitrogen does not result in the synthesis of arginase, unless the nonmetabolizable inducer, homoarginine, is added. The urea degradation system is induced by urea but not by arginine in an arginase-negative mutant. Thus, arginase and the urea degradation system appear to be produced independently of each other; the induction of arginase is contingent upon the presence of arginine, while that of the urea degradation system requires the metabolism of this compound to urea."

https://openalex.org/W80685430,"Abstract A major envelope protein of Escherichia coli was previously found to exist in two different forms in the cell envelope: the free form and the bound form which is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan. Chemical properties of the free form were further investigated and compared with those of the bound form. The envelope fraction labeled with both [14C]palmitic acid and [3H]arginine was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after removal of phospholipid by extensive extraction with the mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1). The palmitic acid content of the free form was found to be identical with that of the bound form on the basis of their arginine contents. As in the case of the bound form, palmitic acid was released from the free form by both alkali and acid hydrolysis. This suggests that palmitic acid attaches to the free form by both ester and amide linkages. It was also found that the free form contained neither diaminopimelic acid nor glucosamine. Preliminary purification of the free form of the lipoprotein is also reported."
https://openalex.org/W1492966140,"Abstract An extracellular β-glucosidase from Aspergillus fumigatus has been purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, molecular sieve chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. An average molecular weight of 40,805 was obtained. The enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.0, Km and Vmax values of 20 mm and 5 µmoles per min per mg, respectively, with sophorose as substrate, and 6.3 mm and 1.5 µmoles per min per mg, respectively, using p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside. Specificity studies indicate that the enzyme is specific for the β-configuration and prefers β-1 → 2 and β-1 → 3 linkages. The purified enzyme contained 32.5 moles of glucose, 16.6 moles of mannose, and 1.84 moles of glucosamine per mole of enzyme. However, when the enzyme was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, all of the glucose was solubilized whereas the mannose and glucosamine remained with the protein, suggesting that glucose was not covalently bound to the enzyme. In order to determine the linkage region of oligosaccharide to protein, the intact enzyme (before treatment with trichloroacetic acid) was treated with mild alkali in the presence of [3H]NaBH4. The only radioactive sugar alcohol formed by this treatment was sorbitol. Since glucose is not covalently bound to the protein and since no radioactive mannitol or glucosaminitol was detected, a hexose linkage to serine or threonine was unlikely. However, hydrolysis of the glycoprotein with stronger alkali in the presence of [3H]NaBH4 yielded an oligosaccharide which gave rise to [3H]glucosaminitol upon acid hydrolysis indicating a glucosamine → asparagine linkage. The β-glucosidase contained 2 moles of glucosamine per mole of protein suggesting at most two oligosaccharide chains. When the protein was digested with Pronase, two major glycopeptides were obtained by Sephadex G-50 chromatography. These contained mannose and aspartic acid in ratios of 10.9 and 4.8, suggesting that there might be two oligosaccharide chains per glycoprotein molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1595799772,"Abstract Equilibrium dialysis measurements of the binding of the allosteric activator ATP and the allosteric inhibitor CTP to native aspartate transcarbamylase show that ATP is bound at 5.1 to 6 sites with similar affinities, whereas Scatchard plots of CTP binding data display a sharp negative curvature indicating that CTP is bound with markedly heterogeneous affinities. ATP binds more weakly than does CTP, and the binding affinities of both nucleotides are decreased several fold by an increase in temperature from 4° to 24°. The binding affinity of CTP is reduced about 2-fold when the catalytic sites of aspartate transcarbamylase are occupied by a tightly bound transition-state analogue, N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA); there is no measurable effect of PALA on the binding of ATP. The heterogeneity in CTP binding affinities is observed under all conditions tested, in a manner consistent with the suggestion that heterogeneity in CTP binding may be due to nonequivalent binding of CTP to sites on dimers of regulatory polypeptide chains in the enzyme. Measurements have been made of the 190 to 320 nm circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of unliganded native aspartate transcarbamylase and of the CD difference spectra arising due to interaction of the enzyme with the substrate analogue PALA, the activator ATP, or the inhibitor CTP, taking these ligands singly or in combination. An estimate of polypeptide configurations in native aspartate transcarbamylase is presented, based on analysis of the 200 to 240 nm CD. Temperature-dependent spectral changes are not detected in the unliganded enzyme but are found in the difference CD at 250 to 320 nm for interaction of ATP or CTP with aspartate transcarbamylase. PALA and CTP added simultaneously to aspartate transcarbamylase have effects on the 200 to 250 nm CD which are not equal to the sum of the effects of PALA or CTP acting separately, reflecting the interdependence in the interaction of these two ligands with aspartate transcarbamylase. PALA, which is an analogue combining features of both of the substrates of aspartate transcarbamylase, produces changes in the 250 to 320 nm CD which are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the sum of the changes observed by other workers for interaction of aspartate transcarbamylase with one substrate and an analogue of the other substrate."

Thus similar coordination geometries must exist in all forms of the enzyme. The MCD suggests that this geometry is that of a distorted tetrahedron. The natural circular dichroism (CD) of the unliganded enzyme shows little change with pH; however, the CD of the phosphate complex undergoes very large changes between pH5 and 9 correlating with the second pKa of phosphate. In marked contrast, the MCD of the phosphate complex is not significantly pH dependent. The phosphate and arsenate complexes of Co(II) alkaline phosphatase show natural CD bands of opposite sign, while the MCD bands are of the same sign. These features suggest that the natural CD is induced by the potential field of the protein external to the Co(II) chromophore. MCD which is not sensitive to the external field reflects only the intrinsic geometry of the ligand field surrounding the Co(II). The significance of the changes in external field to the mechanism of action is discussed."

Both enzymes catalyzed a condensation between [3-3H3]pyruvate and glyoxylate. It was found that C—C synthesis occurred 6 to 7 times faster than C—T bond cleavage. Thus, pyruvate deprotonation appeared to be partially rate-limiting in C—C synthesis. Condensations were carried out between (3R)-[3-3H, 2H, H]pyruvate or (3S)-[3-3H, 2H, H]pyruvate to form (4-RS)-2-keto-4-hydroxy-[3-3H, 2H]glutarate which was decarboxylated to dl-[3-3H, 2H]malate. The prochirality of malate's C-3 was analyzed by determining tritium release catalyzed by fumarase and maleate hydratase. It was found that malate derived from (3R)-[3-3H, 2H, H]pyruvate was of (3R)-3-3H, 2H-configuration while that derived from (3S)-[3-3H, 2H, H]pyruvate was of (3S)-3-3H, 2H-configuration. Comparison with stereochemical models shows that the configuration at C-3 of pyruvate is thus retained during C—C synthesis catalyzed by the two aldolases studied, i.e. both the exchanging proton and aldehyde approach the same face of bound enolpyruvate.

The use of isopropylidene-glycerol as the acceptor greatly facilitates purification since the resulting transfer product (d-isopropylideneglycerol-β-d-galactopyranoside) is chloroform-soluble while the split products of the reaction as well as the substrate and other transfer products are not. Chloroform and isopropylidene-glycerol were removed by distillation and the final product was obtained after mild hydrolysis with acetic acid. (2R)-Glyceryl-β-galactopyranoside was found to be a substrate of both the β-methylgalactoside transport system and the galactose-binding protein while the (2S) isomer was not. Both sugars are recognized by β-galactosidase and the lactose transport system."

This result is in conflict with the hypothesis that maturation of the immune response is based on competition for limiting amounts of antigen among cells with receptors of varying avidity."
https://openalex.org/W1479878137,"Abstract The inducible detoxifying enzyme cysteine desulfhydrase from Salmonella typhimurium moved as a single component of activity during purification by gel chromatography of disrupted cellular preparations. The estimated Stokes radius obtained with a calibrated column was 84 A. The single active component observed during the density gradient centrifugation of crude preparations had an approximate molecular weight of 184,000. The partially purified preparations were employed for kinetic studies in order to gain insight into the mechanism of this substrate-activated enzyme. In the absence of modifiers, the reaction rate has a sigmoidal dependence upon cysteine concentration. Plots of 1/v versus 1/S are concave upward. These plots approach linearity at high cysteine concentrations. Hill plots yield values of n = 1.7 to 1.9 at low cysteine concentrations and n = 1.0 at high cysteine concentrations. Plots of 1/v versus 1/Sn with n = 1.7 revealed a linear relationship over the substrate range 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm. The stoichiometry of product formation, measured with fresh extracts, was 1:1 with respect to pyruvate and sulfide. Various analogs of the substrate, cysteine, have profound effects on the kinetic parameters. The compounds, l-homocysteine, 2-mercaptopropionate, glutathione (reduced form), S-methyl-l-cysteine, l-serine, and l-methionine activated the enzyme to varying degrees without causing large changes in n. None of these compounds could function as a substrate. Dithiothreitol could function as an activator which abolished homotropic interactions, as evidenced by a decrease in n to 1.0. Methionine could reverse this effect. When methionine and dithiothreitol were present in equimolar amounts the kinetics became sigmoid again with a value of n = 2.05. Dithiothreitol appears to cause aggregation of the enzyme as determined by gel chromatography. Methionine reverses this effect. Sulfide at 10µm exhibits a noncompetitive type of inhibition in plots of 1/v versus 1/S2. A mixed type of inhibition occurs at 100 µm sulfide. The inhibitor 2-mercaptoethylamine abolished homotropic interactions (n decreased to 1.0) but increased the apparent Vmax. d-Cysteine and mercaptoethanol inhibited the reaction without any significant changes in the value of n. A desensitized enzyme preparation, for which a value of n = 1.95 was obtained in the absence of substrate analogs, was insensitive to serine activation."

These potentials are accompanied by reductions in multiple nerve cell activity and reductions in behavioral motility. The method used in this study provides a tool for evaluating recovery from neurosurgical trauma or other brain injuries, and for testing procedures that facilitate or impede this process."

https://openalex.org/W1490690829,"Abstract Physical studies have been performed on a genetically fused enzyme and its two component wild type enzymes, l-histidinol dehydrogenase and imidazolylacetol phosphate:l-glutamate aminotransferase. The circular dichroic activity of the peptide chromophore of the fused enzyme is approximately accounted for by a weighted average of the activities of the two wild type enzymes. All three proteins lose circular dichroic activity in dilute alkali. The fluorescence behavior of the wild type dehydrogenase is significantly modified in the fused enzyme. Tyrosyl fluorescence is quenched and tryptophanyl fluorescence is strongly red-shifted in the fused enzyme compared to their behavior in the wild type dehydrogenase. The absorption and emission properties of the cofactor (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate) are quite different in the two enzymes. At neutral pH, the wild type aminotransferase two exhibits absorption peaks at 330 and 430 nm whereas only the 330-nm band is evident with the fused enzyme. Titration of either enzyme between pH 10 and 12 results in the disappearance of the 330-nm peak with the parallel formation of a band centered at 385 nm. The 430-nm band of the aminotransferase is replaced by a band located at 355 nm when the pH is increased between 7 and 11. The wild type aminotransferase and the fused enzyme fluoresce with a peak near 400 nm when excited at 330 nm. Three pH-dependent fluorescence transitions are observed in the cofactor of the aminotransferase whereas only two are apparent in the fused enzyme. These occur in the former enzyme, between pH 4 and 6, pH 7.5 and 9.5, and pH 10 and 12.5. The most acidic transition in both enzymes probably represents the ionization of the pyridinium group of the Schiff base form of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor. The most alkaline transition appears to result from the release of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate from the two enzymes and the ionization of its phenolic group."
